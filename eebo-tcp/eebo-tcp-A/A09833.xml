         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

wherein you haue carried your selfe so worthily in

cast your eye vpon this History written by <hi>Polybius,</hi> who
(in the opinion of most men of Iudgement) hath beene
held to be very sincere, and free from malice, affection or
passion. And to iustifie the truth thereof, he protests that
he was present at many of the actions, and receiued the rest
from confident persons who were eye-witnesses. It is a
generall History of his time, of all the warres which past

in <hi>Asia, Greece,</hi> and the <hi>Romane</hi> State, against the <hi>Gaules,</hi>
and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> which two Citties contended for the
Empiry of the world: which warre was of longer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance,
and had more cruell and variable encounters and
battailes than any that hath beene written of: For the first
Punique warre (where they fought for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of <hi>Sicily</hi>) lasted foure and twenty yeeres; and the
second in <hi>Italy</hi> vnder <hi>Hannibal,</hi> Generall for the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>

in Battell he lost the glory of all his former Victories, and
brought his Countrey into the subiection of the <hi>Romanes.</hi>

Censure, humbly praying that you will be pleased to beare

guided by reason, shall finde it selfe crost, I know not by what power,
which commonly fortune vsurpes ouer the iudgement and considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Man, wee may (as we thinke) iustly blame it, in excusing
with compassion the workeman and his misfortune. And if on the

or faire course, seekes to bring some Enterprize to an end, so as
that notwithstanding his ouer-weaning and folly shee makes it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:
Then we hold her prodigall, detesting her vnreasonable and
inconsiderate bounty, grieuing at her benefits so ill imployed.
Behold how, (I know not by what law receiued among men) wee
commend or blame euery one in his profession and workes, so farre
forth as they see his industry and diligence imployed or defectiue.
If wee haue reason then in so great Esteeme, as wee seeke it in all
our actions, and in matters of the smallest consequence, blaming
him that neglects it: How infamous wee hold the carelesnesse and
neglect of a man in the order and conduct of affaires, wherein not
onely the ruine of his estate, life and honour, but also that of his
Countrey, Parents, and Friends, and finally of his Prince and
Soueraigne, is many times brought into great danger? But if there
be no Enterprize among those which Men pursue, wherin such things
ought to bee drawne into Consideration, as proper and ordinary vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,
and without the danger whereof hee can reape no benefit, I
am of opinion that that of warre ought in reason to bee preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:16537:4"/>
all others: Although there bee many, which cannot alwaies be
brought to a good end, without the hazard and danger of those
which pursue them. In truth it is a profession, which experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
hath taught in all Nations, to bee so rough and fierce, and
finally so difficult to mannage, as neuer man could carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
so discreetly, nor with so great fortune, nor recouered such
rich spoiles, nor obtained such Triumphant victories, but they
haue purchased him new causes of Care and feare, not onely of
great Enuie, and of new Enemies, but also losse and ruine. I
will not speake of the irreparable defeate of the brauest Men in
an Armie, which a Victory worthy of renowne requires, as
it were by aduance, when as the Enemies performe the Duties
of good souldiers. The Carthagians thrusting an Army into Sicily, at
their first entry obtained some Conquests, so soone after they prouoked
hatred of the <hi>Romanes:</hi> which was but the beginning and
prefage of a future ruine. But when as the fortune of the warres
beganne to smile vpon <hi>Hanibal,</hi> and to giue him a full Gale,
so as his exploits were so great in <hi>Spaine,</hi> as afterward hee
presumed to force Nations, Mountaines, and riuers, and in
the end to fight with the Extremity of the weather for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of <hi>Italy:</hi> Then, as it were, fearing her owne power, to bee
in a manner vanquished, shee beganne to practize and forge
meanes, not onely to ruine her so much fauoured <hi>Hanibal,</hi> but
the whole Carthaginian Empire. And therefore it is credible,
that (I know not by what inconstancy, or rather extrauagant
and sauage Nature) shee makes friends of Enemies, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of her owne friends; so much shee feares (as I imagine)
the ease and rest of those whom shee fauours. It is true that traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique
by Sea is not without great terrour, amazement and hazard,
for the danger of the waues, Tempests and stormes, with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
other accidents. But if warre once set vp her sailes, being
accompanied with rage, fury, and many other disasters, which
the malice of Men haue inuented to make vse of, beleeue mee
that these other furies, which the winds procure at Sea and
in the Aire, which many times are more fearefull than mortall,
will not seeme in regard of those of warre, but a light amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and, as it were, a false allarum. What torment at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ea,
or violence of the winds hath euer beene so soddaine, which the
<pb facs="tcp:16537:4"/>
long experience of a wise Pilot, could not by a thousand
signes and tokens foresee, deuising sufficient remedier to auoid
it? But when a warre is mannaged by Iudgement and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as it is requisite, the shewes are commonly contrarie,
to that which they pursue. Wherefore the more an Enterprize
is dissembled and keept secret, the more easie it is to put in
execution. Finally, if wee will confesse the truth, it is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
which among all others, requires the greatest vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie;
a continuall Care, with an incredible diligence: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
a good Iudgement must haue the conduct, that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture
drawne from things formerly practized, or from a
probability of that which hee sees, hee may soone after iudge
of the Enemies resolution, and finally attempt and hope for a
victory.</p>
            <p>And although it hath beene alwaies held, that Money is the
sinewer of Warre; yet I hold its force without Conduct<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
like vnto that of a strong, able Man, opprest with a deepe
sleepe, whose senses haue made their retreate for his rest. So
there is nothing so strong, nor so quicke in this world as the
sense of man: Nor any thing so powerfull and terrible,
which the vnderstanding doth not master and subdue. And
therefore wee say commonly in <hi>France,</hi> that wit is better
than force. Yet I know that Courage is a great aduantage;
and necessary for a souldier, but especially for a Generall:
But I feare that for want of Iudgement and a good conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
it makes them not sometimes ouer-weening and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
of danger. So as many times it giues occasion to a
weake and cowardlie Enemie, to vndertake a Victory, and
to performe the Act of a valiant man. Wherefore courage
without conduct, and vigilancie, is alwayes subiect to Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bushes
and shamefull flights: which are inconuentenees,
whereof a Coward is alwaies warie, for that feare makes a
Man vigilant and carefull. But was there euer Nation
more hardie, nor more warre-like, nor that more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
obserued the ordinances of warre than the <hi>Romanes?</hi>
How then did <hi>Hannibal</hi> defeate them so often, not onely
in Encounters, but in pitcht Battailes, and in the open
<pb facs="tcp:16537:5"/>
field, by his great Iudgement, and his subtile pollicies? In
what feare, and with what admiration hath the fury of the
<hi>Gaules,</hi> beene held in old time by all Natio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, who parting
from their owne Countrey and Townes, to seeke new habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
haue conquered land in diuers Countries by Armes,
building Townes not onely in <hi>Italy</hi> their Neighbour, but also
in <hi>Germany,</hi> and in the end in <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Asia?</hi> Who
hath defeated and quite ruinated them in a short time, but
their owne Consideration, and an ouer-weaning confidence
in their force and courage? I hold for certaine, which you
know well, that it is not sufficient for a Prince or Generall to
haue his Armie compleate with foote and horsemen, how reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
soeuer, and with all necessary prouisions for a warre: No
more than for a Souldier to haue youth, strong and actiue
Members, a daring courage, and compleate furniture. Hee
must haue to vanquish (the which many times the vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

resolute souldier doth easily his owne ruine, if hee wants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
and Iudgement. You must vnderstand that as the body
requires Exercise to preserue in health, and to make it actiue,
and hardened to indure labour and paine; so the vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in like manner desires to bee exercised and imployed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the consideration of things past, or by those which are
visible.</p>
            <p>It is true, that those which are seene by the eye, haue a
greater viuacitie, and a stronger impression, than those which
are past: For that liuing things are of greater force than
dead. Yet, if we shall duely consider the length of time, which
the experience of a thousand kind of pollicies, which warre
requires before that a wise Man will dare to aduenture
himselfe in a bold and hardie Enterprize, wee shall finde
that the knowledge of the antient warres, which haue beene
<pb facs="tcp:16537:5"/>
left vs in writing, will bee of no small consequence vnto
him. For besides the assurance of danger, hee may in a short
time see by Historiographers, the great and wonderfull exploits
of the Antient in a manner since the Creation of the world,
to pleasure and contentment from them, with some Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to doe aswell or better hereafter. You know well that
the warre which is seene by the eye, is not alwaies made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
warre-like people, nor vnder resolute Commaunders,
that are skilfull in their profession: so as it is a difficult
thing vnder such to see any valiant exploits, nor Enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes
attempted with good inuention, nor well executed. Wee
say commonly in <hi>France,</hi> that the Combate is dangerous,
when as courage fights against courage. So is it credible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
when an Army consisting of warre-like men, is vnder the
leading of a wise and resolute Commander, hauing in front
an Enemy equall vnto him in all degrees, there must needes
bee valiant exploits performed, with hardy Enterprizes wisely
mannaged.</p>
            <p>If there haue beene any warres, attempted by fierce
and warlike Nations, and gouerned by wise and famous
Captaines, beleeue me this present Historiographer hath vsed
great diligence to set them downe in writing: Labouring on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to mention the deedes and valour that was most worthy of
Relation, that with the pleasure and contentment which they
may reape in reading them, they may draw some instructions
and meanes, not to fall into the inconuiences of warre, into the
danger whereof many times both Captaine and souldiers may
bee ingaged, through want of experience, good aduice and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.
So as among others, you shall see Enterprizes of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi>
against the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> for the conquest of <hi>Sicily.</hi>
During the which there were many Encounters and cruell bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes,
as well by Sea as land. You shall likewise reade
the furious Combat of the <hi>Gaules</hi> against the <hi>Romanes:</hi>
And moreouer the warre betwixt <hi>Cleomenes</hi> and <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
for <hi>Morea,</hi> the which <hi>Philip</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi>
tooke afterwards. And besides many other notable
exploites, (which at this present I will forbeare)
<pb facs="tcp:16537:6"/>
you shall see the Conquests which <hi>Hannibal</hi> made in <hi>Spaine,</hi>
with his incredible voiage into <hi>Italie,</hi> performed in his
younger yeeres, and his victories gotten of the <hi>Romanes</hi>
with such pollicie and wisedome, as it is a difficult thing (if
wee shall consider the people and number of his Armie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
regard to courage and power of those with whom
hee had to deale) to iudge truely, whether there were euer
Captaine in the memory of man, that may with reason bee
compared vnto him. Finally my Masters, I doe not promise
you in this History, those miraculous Battailes, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the apprehension of man, performed in the Kingdome
of <hi>Logres,</hi> nor I know not what Quest of that barking Beast.
Make your accompt that you shall not finde any Tract or
marke of a Beast, nor finally any thing that holds of it.
Beleeue mee in times past, Men did not feede their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
with dreames, nor fables inuented in barbers-shops,
without any colour of Truth. It is impossible an ignorant
Master should make a learned disciple. Finally they are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
fit for old womens tongues to entertaine little child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,
whilest that for weakenesse of their Age, their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
hath no apprehension, nor sufficient Iudgement of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
Wherefore wee may with reason say, that such as co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sume
their yeeres, and grow old in such dreames, haue a
will to continue still children. And although they commonly
saie, that warre is mannaged by the eye: So as it seemes
they will thereby inferre, that wee must not thinke of it,
but when necessity doth force vs: And that peace should
procure no benefit to a Souldier, but idlenesse; yet he must
fore-see long before, part of that which afterwards he must
gouerne by the eye. And as a horse which is pampered
and not ridden, growes restit; and proues vnprofitable to
his Master for trauaile: so the vnderstanding of a souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
idle during peace, or fed with dreames and foolish in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
will faile him at neede; and in the end purchase
him dishonour and shame; Yet do not imagine my Masters,
that I haue vsed this speech as blazoning you, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you for men of so poore an Enterprize, whose principall
<pb facs="tcp:16537:6"/>
study and affections is the reading of such Bookes, rather then
in some worthy recreation and exercise. My meaning was
onely to aduertise you, that Histories, from whence with
pleasure you may draw great profit, as these are which this
Historiographer imparts vnto you ought to bee in greater
recommendation than those Fables, which haue no grac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
but when they are most without reason or any shew of
truth.</p>
            <p>Finally, I hope you shall finde such sufficiencie in our
<hi>Polybius,</hi> as you will make no question to preferre him
as the paragon before all others, aswell <hi>Greekes</hi> as <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi>
which are come to the knowledge of men. Of whom I
haue presumed to translate in the best sort I could, those fiue
first Bookes, which of Fourty which hee hath written,
haue beene preserued halfe ruined by the negligence of time:
Hoping you will receiue them as willingly, as I offer them
with a good heart.</p>
            <p>When as after the Printing of these fiue first Bookes,
I had recouered some Latine Translations, of three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
of the sixt, whereof the first and the third had not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>GREEKE</hi> Coppie, And likewise afterwards an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
of the sixteenth, both in <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Greeke,</hi> I
imployed my selfe to put them into <hi>French,</hi> adding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
the forme of the <hi>Romanes</hi> Campe, as I could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture
it, by the discription which <hi>Polybius</hi> maker, in
the parcell of the sixt Booke. And when as the Printers
successor had a desire afterwards to print the whole, and
intreated mee to spend some time in the Remainder of that
which was newly published of <hi>Polybius</hi> his workes, which
are certaine parcells, and as it were Reliques (besides the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
named) of the seuenth and eighth, and of all the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
Bookes vnto the seauententh inclusiue, it was not in
my power to deliuer him any other but those of the seuenth
and eighth, being afflicted with a quartane Ague, besides his
obstinacy in vsing a small Character, for the sparing of
Paper distasted mee: Expecting that which afterwards fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
that few men would rest satisfied, for that all things
<pb facs="tcp:16537:7"/>
how good and excellent soeuer, are thereby found without
grace, dull and vnpleasing. For this cause desiring that so
excellent a writer, should not remaine disdained and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
grace for want of an honourable Impression, and that
the studio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s of Histories should bee the more incouraged, I
resolued to adde the remainder of that, which at this day is
come to our knowledge, assuring my selfe that the Printer
for his part will haue a care that for the sauing of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
hee will not doe wrong to his honour, nor loose his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
instead of gaine.</p>

by me to whom the newnesse of Actions, whereof wee intend
to Write, is much more then sufficient to perswade and draw the
hearts of men, aswell both Young and Old, to read our History. For
where is any man so depraued or silly, which desires not to vnderstand

the meanes and manner of Gouernment, by the which the <hi>Romans</hi>
haue subdued and brought vnder their Obedience in a manner, all the
Nations of the World, within the space of fifty and three yeares?
the which in former times was neuer heard of. Or what is he so much

world worthy to be preferred to this knowledge? I hope they will see
how great and excellent our Worke is, if wee make comparison of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Principalities with the excellency of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, and
namly of those which haue beene in great honour and glory, whereof
Historiographers haue written much. Behold those which are most
worthy to be compared.</p>
            <p>The Empire and power of the <hi>Persians</hi> for a time hath beene great,<note place="margin">The <hi>Persians.</hi>
               </note>
but whensoeuer they did aduenture to passe the bounds and limits of
<hi>Asia</hi> they were in danger to lose not onely their Empire, but their
liues. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> made a long warre for the Empire and
command of <hi>Greece,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi>
               </note> but they could hardly keepe it twelue yeeres quiet

            <p>It is true,<note place="margin">The <hi>Macedonians</hi>
               </note> the <hi>Macedonians</hi> haue domineer'd and rul'd in <hi>Europe,</hi>
from <hi>Adria</hi> to the <hi>Danowe,</hi> which is but a small portion thereof. And
since they haue held the Empire of <hi>Asia,</hi> after they had ruined the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
of the <hi>Persians.</hi> And although that these haue in shew beene
great Lords, and enioyed large aud spacious Countries, yet they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
toucht the greatest part of the World. As for <hi>Sicily, Sardinia,</hi>
and <hi>Affricke,</hi> they neuer made shew to challenge any thing. In regard
of other Nations, the most Martiall of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the most Westerne,
they hardly in my opinion did euer know them:<note place="margin">The <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </note> But the <hi>Romans</hi> haue
not onely conquered a part of the World, but in a manner all. They
may also know by our sequell, how great the profit will be to such as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the knowledge of History.</p>
            <p>Finally,<note place="margin">The beginning of the History.</note> the beginning of our Worke shall be according to the time,
since the hundred and eight and forty <hi>Olimpiade:</hi> As for the Actions,
and first of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> wee will begin with the sociall warre, the
which <hi>Philip</hi> (who was Sonne to <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and Father to <hi>Perseus</hi>)
attempted first with the <hi>Acatans,</hi> against the <hi>Et<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lians,</hi> and in regard of
those which inhabite <hi>Asia,</hi> the beginning shall be at the Warre which
was in the Valley of <hi>Syria,</hi> betwixt <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and <hi>Ptolome, Philopater.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as for <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Affricke,</hi> wee will begin with that betwixt the
<hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> which many call the warre of <hi>Hanniball.</hi>
The History shall begin at the end of that which <hi>Sicionius</hi> hath left in
writing. Before these times the affaires of the world were without
Ciuillity. Since it hath happened that the History is in a manner
drawne all into one, and that the actions of <hi>Italy,</hi> and of <hi>Affricke,</hi>
are mingled with those of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> and that all tended to one
and the same end. And therefore wee haue begun our worke in those
times, when the <hi>Romans</hi> had vanquished the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in this war,
thinking they had performed their greatest taske, and to be able to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile
the whole world, they presumed presently after to fall vpon the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16537:9"/>
rest, and to passe into <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi> with great forces.</p>
            <p>But if we had seene and knowne the manner of liuing, and the Lawes
of Common-weales contending for the Monarchy, happily it would
not be needfull to make any great search, to what end, nor vpon what
power relying, they haue entred into such great actions. But for that
the manner of liuing, the precedent forces, and the actions of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> are vnknowne to the greatest part of the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi>
I haue held it necessary to make these two first Bookes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I enter into the History, to the end they should haue no occasion
to wonder nor inquire in reading our Worke, what Councell, what
Forces, and what Treasure and Wealth the people of <hi>Rome</hi> had to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
the warre and conquest of the whole Earth, and of all our Sea:
Considering that they which shall require it, shall see plainely by these
first Bookes of our Preparation, that the <hi>Romans</hi> had reasonable cause
to vndertake the Empire and Soueraignty of all things, and to attaine
vnto their ends. Beleeue that the proper obiect of our Worke, and
the excellency of the Actions of our time, consists principally in
this, that as Fortune hath in a manner reduced all the affaires of the
world into one, and hath forced them to draw to one and the same
end: So the force which shee hath vsed for the perfection of all publicke
gouernment, must be reduced and propounded to the Reader in one
briefe History.</p>
            <p>This hath chiefely incited and vrged mee to the enterprise thereof,
especially for that none of our time hath vndertaken to write a generall
History: neither would wee haue attempted it: But seeing that many
had written some particular Warres, and their priuate Actions, and
that no Man (to my knowledge) hath hitherto made an vniuersall and
generall commemoration of things past, neither when nor how they
began, nor how they were executed and performed, nor what issue
they had: I conceiued it would be well done, if by our meanes our
Countrey-men might read a worke of Fortune excellently good and
profitable: For although shee had done excellent things and worthy
of admiration among man: yet shee hath not done any thing vnto this
day, nor purchased the glory of victory comparable to our times. The
which they that haue written the particular Histories cannot make
knowne, but that some one who peraduenture for that hee had liued in
some renowned Towne, or for that they had seene them in picture,
imagine presently they know them: and consequently the scituation, the
forme, and the order of the World, the which is not probable nor
likely.</p>
            <p>They which are of Opinion that a particular History is sufficient for
the vnderstanding of the generall, in my Opinion stray no lesse from
the truth,<note place="margin">A good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison.</note> then if some one considering the parts separated of a liuing
Body, thinke by this meanes to haue the knowledge of all the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and graces of the Creature. There is no doubt; but if any one takes
these distinct and separated parts, and doth presently ioyne them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and make a perfect Creature, giuing it forme and life, and then
presents it vnto him, hee will soone confesse that hee hath beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16537:10"/>
like vnto them that dreame. It is true, we may haue some
apprehension of the whole by the parts: But it is not possible to haue a
true and certaine Science and Knowledge. And therefore you must

an accord with them, which they found good and profitable, and had
recouered their liberty contrary to their hope and expectance, and had
in a manner taken a beginning of their increase, they declared Warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their Neighbours. As soone as the <hi>Latins</hi> had beene vanquished,

their Armes against the <hi>Tuscans,</hi> then to the <hi>Celtes</hi> which are in <hi>Italy,</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Mamertins</hi> as we haue sayd, being depriued of the succours of

as to those that were of the same Nation. The <hi>Romans</hi> were long in
suspence what to doe: For they found it strange, hauing lately punished
their Cittizens so seuerely, for violating their faith with the <hi>Rhegins,</hi>
to send succours now vnto the <hi>Mamertins</hi> who were guilty of the like
crime. They were not ignorant of all these things: Yet considering
that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had not onely drawne <hi>Affricke</hi> vnder their
obedience by force of Armes, but also many places in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and
moreouer all the Islands of the Sea of <hi>Sardinia</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> they doubted
that their Neighbour-hood would be dangerous, if they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
Lords of the rest of <hi>Sicily.</hi> They likewise vnderstood, that it would
be easie to effect, if the <hi>Mamertins</hi> were not relieued: And there
was no doubt, that if <hi>Messina</hi> had beene deliuered vnto them, they
would presently haue recouered <hi>Saragosse,</hi> for that they held all the
rest of <hi>Sicily.</hi> And as the <hi>Romans</hi> considered these things, they were
of opinion that it was necessary not to abandon <hi>Messina,</hi> nor to suffer
the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> to make vnto themselues as it were a Bridge, to passe
into <hi>Italy</hi> at their pleasure.</p>
            <p>This was long in debate, yet it was not concluded in that assembly:
for it seemed vnto them as vnreasonable as profitable to relieue the
<hi>Mamertins.</hi> But as the Commons much weakned with their former

This Opinion being confirmed by the Commons, presently
they appointed <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi> one of the Consuls, to passe the Army
into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and to relieue the <hi>Mamertins,</hi> who had put out of their

hung him on a Crosse which had had the Guard, supposing that he
had yeelded it basely for feare and want of Courage. Then suddainly
they drew their Sea-army neere vnto <hi>Pellore,</hi> and that at land about the

with great danger, in the end he arriued at <hi>Messina:</hi> where seeing the
Enemy round about it, and that this Siege was as dishonourable vnto
him as dangerous, for that the Enemies were the stronger both by Land
and Sea, he desired first to try by Embassies sent to both Camps, if it
might be possible to pacifie things, so as the <hi>Mamertins</hi> might be
freed. But the Enemies not vouchsafing to heare them, he was in the
end forced to vndergoe the hazard, and resolued first to giue battell to
the <hi>Saragossins.</hi> He therefore causeth his Army to march, and put it in
battell: to the which the King likewise came speedily. But after that

the first Voyage which the <hi>Romane</hi> Army made out of <hi>Italy.</hi>
And for that we haue held it fit for the entrance of our designe, we haue
made it our beginning, in looking somewhat backe to the times past, to
the end we may not leaue any occasion of doubt vpon the causes we shall
yeeld. And in truth I haue held it necessary to declare first at what
time, and by what meanes the <hi>Romans</hi> being in extreame danger to lose
their Countrey, began to grow fortunate: And when likewise after
they had subdued <hi>Italy,</hi> they began to conquer other Countries; to
the end that the greatnesse of their Empire, which was since, may
seeme more likely in knowing the beginnings. No man must wonder
when as we speake of Townes of Note, if happily wee seeke for things
farther off, in that which we shall relate hereafter: For we doe it to
the end that our beginnings and grounds may be such, as they may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vnderstand the meanes and reasons, by the which euery Citty is come
to the estate wherein it now stands, the which we haue done here of the

            <p>It is now time that in leauing this Discourse we returne to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe,
in shewing first summarily and briefely the things happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the times, whereof we meane principally to Write: Among the
which the Warre betwixt the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in <hi>Sicily</hi> is the
first, then followed the <hi>Punique:</hi> In the which the deeds first of <hi>Amilcar,</hi>
then of <hi>Asdruball,</hi> are ioyned with those of the <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> At
what time the <hi>Romans</hi> began first to sayle into <hi>Slauonia,</hi> and other parts
of <hi>Europe.</hi> Moreouer their Battels against the <hi>Gaules,</hi> who at that time
made a discent into <hi>Italy:</hi> The Warre also which was in <hi>Greece</hi> at the
same time, called <hi>Cleomenique,</hi> to the which all this relation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the
end of the second Booke tend. Finally, I haue not held it necessary nor
profitable for the Reader, to relate things in particular: Neither is it
my intention to Write them, but onely to touch that summarily which
may concerne our History. And therefore in relating briefely, we will
indeauour by an order of continuation, to ioyne vnto the beginning of
our History the end of those Actio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

preparation. By this meanes in continuing the order of the History,
they shall see we haue toucht that which others haue left in Writing:
and also made an easie and open way for all subsequent things, to those

               </gap> haue had a speciall desire to
write somewhat at large this first Warre of the <hi>Romans</hi> in <hi>Sicily</hi> against
the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> for that they shall hardly finde a longer Warre,
nor greater preparations and expence, nor more encounters, nor grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
diuersity of fortune on eyther side; For these two Nations in those
times liued in their lawes with meane wealth and equall forces. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if we shall consider the Forces and Empire of these two Citties, we
cannot so well make a Comparison by the other subsequent Warres as

haue in my Opinion strayed too much from the truth: Yet I would not

that they did all things with good Conduct, Prudence and Courage;
and the <hi>Romans</hi> the contrary. As for <hi>Fabius</hi> he holds the contrary par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Peraduenture a man would not blame this manner of doing in other
courses of life. In truth it is fit and commendable for a good man to loue
his Friends and Countrey, and to be a friend to the friends of his friends,
and to hate his Enemies. But he that takes vpon him to Write a History,
must vse such things with discretion, sometimes commending his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
when their actions require it, and blaming his Friends and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
when their faults are blame worthy. Beleeue me, as the remainder
of the Body of a Beast, which hath the eyes pul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> out, remaines vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table:
So if truth be wanting in a History, the Discourse prooues fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse.
And therefore when occasion is offered, he must not forbeare to
blame his Friends, nor to commend his Enemies, nor to hold it a disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
thing to praise those whom we haue sometimes blamed. Neither is
it likely, that they of whom we write, haue alwaies done well, or err'd
continually. We must therefore in leauing the persons, iudge and speake
of their actions sufficiently in our Comentaries.</p>
            <p>To prooue my assertian true,<note place="margin">Philin.</note> we shall easily see it by that which <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
writes. Who in the beginning of his second Booke saith, the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi>
and <hi>Saragossins</hi> held <hi>Messina</hi> besieged, and when as the <hi>Romane</hi>
Army, after they had past the Sea, was arriued, they made a suddaine sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vpon the <hi>Saragossins,</hi> where they were vanquished and defeated, and
so retired into the Towne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they made a second vpon the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
where they were not onely defeated, but most part of them taken: Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after this Speech he saith, that <hi>Hieron</hi> after this Encounter had so
great a feare, that he not onely set fire of his Lodgings and Tents, reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
by night to <hi>Saragosse,</hi> but moreouer abandoned the strong places,
lying betwixt <hi>Messina</hi> and <hi>Saragosse.</hi> He relates also that the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
being in like sort amazed, dispersed themselues here and there
throughout the Townes of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and that they durst neuer after that
keepe the Field, and that moreouer, the Captaines seeing their men dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
gaue aduice that they should no more run into the danger of
the war, nor hazard any thing. He saith moreouer that the <hi>Romans</hi> in the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16537:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
pursuit of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> not onely ruined their Prouince, and that
of the <hi>Saragossins,</hi> but also layed siege to <hi>Saragosse.</hi> This Speech is so
farre from reason, as it were but lost time to seeke to confute it: For he
pretends that they which besieged <hi>Messina,</hi> (to whom he giues the
Victory) presently after abandoned their Campe, and that they fled,
retiring into the Citty with great feare, and that finally they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged.
In regard of those he affirmes were besieged by the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
after the battell lost, he makes them suddainly Victors, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieging
<hi>Saragosse,</hi> hauing taken their Camps, and made courses into the
Enemies Countrey. Doubtlesse these are discourses which cannot well
be reconciled; for either that which he saith first, is false, or that which
followeth: But it is certaine, and knowne to all men, that the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
and <hi>Saragossins</hi> abandoned their Campe, and raised the siege reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
into their Towne, and that the <hi>Romans</hi> vsed great dilligence to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege
<hi>Saragosse:</hi> Wherefore the probability is great, that his first Speech
is false, and that notwithstanding the <hi>Romans</hi> had gotten the Victory
before <hi>Messina,</hi> yet this Historiographer hath supposed that they were
defeated by the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> You shall often see <hi>Philin</hi> in this errour:
and <hi>Fabin</hi> no lesse, as we haue obserued in many places. Wherefore to
returne where we left, we will vse all possible indeauour to make the truth
of our History cleere and plaine, for those that desire to vnderstand it.</p>
            <p>After that the newes of <hi>Sicily</hi> were come to <hi>Rome</hi> of the Victory of
<hi>Appius</hi> and his men,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Marcus Valeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and Octocili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Consuls.</note> 
               <hi>Marcus Valerius</hi> and <hi>Octacilius</hi> being newly cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
Consuls, they were sent thither with all their <hi>Roman</hi> power. The
<hi>Romans</hi> had foure Legions in their Army of their owne Nation,<note place="margin">The order of the Romane Armies, and the number of men in a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> besides
the succours which they drew from their Allies. Euery Legion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
of foure thousand Foote, and three hundred Horse. By this meanes
at the Consuls comming, many Citties aswell of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> as
of the <hi>Saragossins,</hi> yeelded to the <hi>Romans.</hi> But when as <hi>Hieron</hi> saw that
the <hi>Sicillians</hi> fainted, and that the <hi>Roman</hi> Army was great, and their
forces increased, he held it better to follow their party, then that of
the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> He therefore sends an Embassie to the Consuls, to
treate of Peace and Friendship.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> seeing the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> Maisters of all the Sea, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing
likewise that the passage for their Victuals might be interdicted, for
that their Armies which had formerly past, had suffred great wants and
necessities, they found the friendship of <hi>Hieron</hi> to be of great conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
for them in this regard.<note place="margin">An accord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Hieron</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> and what it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ntaines.</note> Wherefore they treated a peace with
the <hi>Saragossins</hi> vnder these following Conditions. First, that the
King should free the <hi>Roman</hi> Prisoners without Ransome, and moreouer
should pay a hundred Tallents of Siluer, and that hereafter the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gossins</hi>
should terme themselues Allies and Friends to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<hi>Hieron,</hi> who of his owne free will put himselfe vnder their
protection, succourd them with men and victuals when need required:
So as afterwards he past the Remainder of his life with as great happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and fortune that euer <hi>Grecian</hi> had done. And in my Opinion this
was an excellent man amongst others, who had beene alwayes happy
in good Councell, aswell for the affaires of the Common-wealth, as for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16537:13"/>
his owne particular. When as the newes of this Treaty came to <hi>Rome,</hi>
and that the people had confirmed it, they did not thinke it necessary
hereafter to send all their forces out of <hi>Italy:</hi> Wherefore conceiuing
that two Legions would suffice there with the alliance of King <hi>Hieron,</hi>
they made their reckoning, that the Warre would be more easily man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged,
and that by this meanes the Army would be the better suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with all things necessary. But when as the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> saw that
<hi>Hieron</hi> was become their Enemy, and that the <hi>Romans</hi> held the greatest
part of <hi>Sicily,</hi> they knew well that they must haue a greater power to
resist them;<note place="margin">Supplies which the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> put into <hi>Agragas.</hi>
               </note> Wherefore they made a great leuy of <hi>Geneuois</hi> and <hi>Gaules</hi>
likewise of <hi>Spaniards</hi> to fortifie them: And after they had caused them
to passe into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and seeing the Towne of <hi>Agragas</hi> very fit for the
preparation of this Warre, and that it was a frontier place, and strong to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Enemy, they put into it all the men they could draw toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with store of Munition, making vse of it against the Enemy as of a
Fort for the Warre.</p>
            <p>After the accord past by the Consuls with <hi>Hieron,</hi> they left the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince;
in whose place <hi>Lucius Posthumus,</hi> and <hi>Quintus Emilius</hi> newly
chosen Consuls, come into <hi>Sicily</hi> with an Army: who after they had
carefully considered of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> Designes, and their prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for Warre made in the Towne of <hi>Agragas,</hi> they were of opinion
to mannage the affaires of <hi>Sicily</hi> with greater courage and resolution then
the last Consuls had done:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Agragas</hi> besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
               </note> Wherefore they drew together all their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and besieged <hi>Agragas</hi> within eight Furlongs, and so kept in the
Enemy. The time of Haruest was come, eliery man made his recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that the Siege would be long; wherefore the Souldiers straying
from their Campe, aduentured somewhat too farre in the gathering of
Corne. When the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> saw their Enemies thus dispersed; run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
here and there confidently throughout the Prouince, they conceiued
a great hope that they should one day be able to defeate them; wherupon
some of them assaulted the Campe with great fury, and the rest charged
those which gathered Corne.<note place="margin">Seuerity of the <hi>Romans</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Souldiers.</note> But the diuersity of the action saued the
<hi>Romans</hi> for that day, as it had done many times before; they hauing a
custome to put those to death, which abandon the place which is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them during the fight, or which flye from the Campe vpon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
whatsoeuer. By this meanes although the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were
farre greater in number, yet the <hi>Romans</hi> resisted them valliantly, who
with great losse of their men made a greater slaughter of their Enemies.
Finally, they not onely repulsed them from their Campe, but pursued
them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>illing part of them, and forcing the rest to retire in a thrung into
the Towne. Moreouer that day was so dangerous to both Armies, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
their feare was great, so as the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> durst no more
assault the <hi>Romans</hi> Campe inconsiderately, nor the <hi>Romans</hi> suffer their
men to gather Corne rashly. But for that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> made no
more sallies, but did onely fight a farre off with casting of Darts and
Stones, the Consuls deuided their Army in two: whereof the one
was planted on the side of <hi>Esculapius</hi> Temple, and the other on
that side which doth looke directly vnto <hi>Heracleum:</hi> And that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16537:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which remained betwixt the two Camps of either side of the Towne,
was rampered with a double ranke of Piles: Then they made a Trench
betwixt them and the Towne, to guard themselues from the Enemies
sallies, and another without the Campe, to hinder the succours which
the Neighbour-townes doe vsually send to the besieged. The places
which were betwixt the Trenches and the Campe were well guarded.
Moreouer all the Allies vsed great dilligence to bring into the Towne
of <hi>Erbese,</hi> victuals, and all things necessary for the Campe; so as the
Souldiers liued at more ease, for it was not farre off.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were fiue Moneths in this estate,
fortune shewing herselfe no more fauorable to the one then to the other:
But what happened by their shooting and casting of Darts: But when
as hunger began to presse the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Fifty thousand men within <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gragas.</hi>
               </note> by reason of the great
multitude of Men which were coopt vp within the Towne, (they were
in truth aboue fifty thousand Men) <hi>Haniball</hi> who was Generall of the
Army, hauing no more hope, sends speedily to <hi>Carthage,</hi> to acquaint
them with the Rampire and Pallisado made about the Towne, and to
demaund succours. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> moued at this Newes, raised
an Army with a great number of Elephants, and sent them by Sea into
<hi>Sicily</hi> to <hi>Hanno,</hi> who was another Captaine Generall for them: who
after he had drawne together his whole Army, marcht to the Citty of
<hi>Heracleum,</hi> and at the first (after he had considered what was to be
done) he tooke the Towne of <hi>Erbese</hi> by Treason, the which vntill that
day had beene a Store-house to the <hi>Romans.</hi> By this meanes he depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
them of Victuals and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> things necessary for their Campe:
wherefore the <hi>Romans</hi> were no lesse besieged, then they that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged.
The want of Victuals did often force them in a manner to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
to raise the Siege: the which vndoubtedly they would haue done,
if <hi>Hieron</hi> King of <hi>Saragosse</hi> had not vsed great diligence to furnish the
Army with Victuals and other necessaries.</p>
            <p>But when that <hi>Hanno</hi> (after all these things) saw that the <hi>Romans</hi>
were much opprest with diseases, and want of all things (without doubt
the plague was great in their Campe) and that his Men were fresh, and
resolute to fight, he drew together aboue fifty Elephants: And
when as all the bands of Souldiers were assembled, he drawes his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
out of <hi>Heracleum,</hi> and causeth the <hi>Numidian</hi> Horse-men to march
before, giuing them charge to skirmish, and to doe all their indeauours
to draw the <hi>Romane</hi> Horse-men to fight, vpon whose charge they
should turne head, and not cease to flye vntill they were returned vnto
him.<note place="margin">A skirmish of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> by the <hi>Numidians.</hi>
               </note> The <hi>Numidians</hi> failed not to execute the Command of their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
nor to skirmish with one of the Camps to draw them to fight.
Presently the <hi>Romane</hi> Horse-men charge them, and pursue them indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly:
But the <hi>Numidians</hi> obseruing the Commandment flye backe
to <hi>Hanno,</hi> and re-charging the Enemy againe, slew many, chasing the
rest vnto their Campe.</p>
            <p>After these things the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> marched, and planted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
vpon Mount <hi>Tor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Campe. Continuing in this manner for the space of two
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16537:14"/>
Moneths, they attempted not any thing, but skirmished daily with their
Arrowes and Darts. In the meane time <hi>Haniball</hi> made fires often in
the Night, and sent men to <hi>Hanno,</hi> to aduertise him that the Army
could endure hunger no longer, and that many of his men were reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the Enemy for want of Victuals. Finally, <hi>Hanno</hi> moued by these
reasons,<note place="margin">A battell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </note> put his men in Battell: wherein the Consull vsed no lesse dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
in regard of their necessities. Either Army drew forth in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
into an equall place: Then they came to combate, whereas they
charged one another with great fury. The Battell was long and cruell:
Finally, the <hi>Romans</hi> brake the Vanguard, and forced them to fly among
the Elephants: who being terrified, opened the rankes of the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>
The Captaines of Hundreds following the Route of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants,
forced the Enemies to turne head. By this meanes the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi>
hauing lost the Battell, and part of them shine, the rest retired
to <hi>Heracleum:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> lose the Battell.</note> and the <hi>Romans</hi> after the taking of most of the Elephants,
and all the baggage of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> retired to their Campe. But
for that they were negligent to keepe a good Guard the night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
aswell for the great ioy which men vsually haue for their good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
as for the toyle of the Battell past; <hi>Haniball</hi> being frustrate of all
hope,<note place="margin">The Retreate of <hi>Haniball</hi> from <hi>Agragas.</hi>
               </note> thought this a fit and conuenient time to saue himselfe and his
Army, for the reason aboue mentioned. Wherefore he drew all his
forces out of <hi>Agragas,</hi> and passed thorough the Enemies Trenches, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them with straw: By this meanes he escaped without any losse,
and without their priuity.</p>
            <p>At the breake of day, when as the <hi>Romans</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> advertised of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
they followed the Enemy a little; but returning soone to take the
Towne, they gaue an assault vnto the Gates, where they found no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.
The whole Army entred and spoyled: It was a rich Towne,
where as the Souldiers tooke many Slaues,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Agragas</hi> spoiled by the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </note> and got great Wealth.
When as the newes came to <hi>Rome</hi> of the taking of <hi>Agragas,</hi> after the
defeate of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> lifted vp their Heads, and
beganne to conceiue greater Designes. They did no longer insist vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the reasons for the which they were first mooued; neyther were they
satisfied, for that they had preserued the <hi>Mamertins</hi> and <hi>Messina,</hi> or
to haue much weakned the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in <hi>Silily:</hi> But hoping for grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Matters, they desired to chase them away wholly, which done
they had a great Hope and opinion to inlarge their Empire much. They
were therefore very attentiue to this businesse, and had no thoughts
but of <hi>Sicily:</hi> knowing well that they were vndoubtedly the stronger at
land.</p>
            <p>After the taking then of <hi>Agragas, Lucius Valerius,</hi> and <hi>Titus Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilius</hi>
being chosen Consulls they were sent into <hi>Sicily</hi> with a great
Army. Thus the Warre was in a manner equall, for that the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi>
were Maisters of the Sea without contradiction; whereof this is
the reason; for after the taking of <hi>Agragas,</hi> most of the Townes which
were in the heart of <hi>Sicily,</hi> yeelded to the <hi>Romans,</hi> fearing their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
at Land: But when as the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> Army by Sea was arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
many more Sea-townes yeelded for feare to their Obedience.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16537:15"/>
Thus their forces were equall. Many times also the Sea coasts of <hi>Italy</hi>
were spoyled by the courses of their Army at Sea, the which <hi>Affricke</hi>
did not suffer. The <hi>Romans</hi> considering carefully of these things, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to fight with their Enemies by Sea.</p>
            <p>This is the thing which hath mooued me most to Write this present
Warre more at large, to the end the Reader may not be ignorant of
this beginning, that is to say, in what manner and for what causes, and
in what time, the people of <hi>Rome</hi> were induced to put an Army to
Sea,<note place="margin">Sixe score vessels for the Sea made spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
               </note> and to fight with their Enemy. Seeing then that there was no
probabillity that the Warre should be otherwise ended, the <hi>Romans</hi>
speedily made sixe score Vessels for the Sea, whereof a Hundred were
<hi>Quinqueremes</hi> or of fiue bankes, and the rest were <hi>Triremes.</hi> It is
true that the <hi>Quinqueremes</hi> were more difficult to make, for that they
had neuer vsed any such Vessels in <hi>Italy</hi> vntill that time. Wherein the
excellency and great courage of the <hi>Romans</hi> is worthy of admiration,
considering they had neuer beene inclined to actions by Sea, neyther
had they euer thought of it vntill that day; yet they aduentured it with
such courage and resolution, as they had sooner fought with the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi>
then made triall of the dangers of the Sea. Although
the others held at that time, in that circuite of the World the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallity
and commaund of the Sea, as formerly gotten by their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours,
and left it vnto them as an hereditary right: which is a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
testimony of the things which we haue Written, of the <hi>Romans</hi>
boldnesse and courage. Beleeue me, when they first aduentured to
passe their Army to <hi>Messina<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> they were only a Hundred ships of War,
and moreouer they had not one Galley nor one Briggandine. It is true
when they vndertooke the Voyage of <hi>Sicily</hi> with an Army, they made
vse of the <hi>Quinqueremes</hi> and <hi>Triremes</hi> of the <hi>Tarrentines, Locreins,</hi>
and <hi>Neapolitans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At that time many <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Ships scoured the Seas about <hi>Sicily,</hi>
whereof a <hi>Quinquereme</hi> straying farre from the rest, was broken by
casualty, and afterwards taken by the <hi>Romans,</hi> which afterwards ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
them for a patterne to make the like, so as all their ships were made
in that manner. Wherefore if this had not hapned, they would haue
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound themselues much troubled in their enterprise.<note place="margin">The <hi>Romans</hi> inuention to invre their men to the Oare.</note> Whilest these
were a making, they did practise a number of men to the Oare after
this manner. They did set bankes in order vpon the Sand, vpon the
which the men that were to Rowe were placed, being attentiue to the
voice of the Patron or Gouernour, who was in the middest of them,
where as they did learne to stretch foorth, and pull backe their armes
altogether, and did draw their Oares in the Sand; finally they beganne
and ended altogether according to the Patrons whistle. By this meanes
hauing learned the Arte to Rowe, and their ships finished, they put to
Sea, and within few dayes after made a Tryall. And when as the
Consull <hi>Cornelius,</hi> lately appointed Commaunder of the Sea Army,
had giuen charge to the Sea Captaines, to draw vnto the Port assoone
as the Vessels should be ready, he went directly to <hi>Messina</hi> with sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteene
ships, and left the rest vpon the <hi>Italian</hi> shore, whereas ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

At that time <hi>Haniball</hi> Commaunder of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> kept his

after this prise returned to <hi>Haniball;</hi> soone after this apparent and new
defeate of <hi>Cornelius, Haniball</hi> (to whom Fortune was at that time gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious)
receiued as great a losse. He had intelligence that the <hi>Romanes</hi>
Army at Sea, which coasted about <hi>Italy,</hi> was not farre from <hi>Sicily.</hi>
Wherefore desiring wonderfully to see their number, and their order,
and the manner of the trimming of their ships, he takes fifty Vessells
and sailes into <hi>Italy.</hi> But for that he had a contrary VVind, the which
was fauourable to the <hi>Romanes</hi> by the reason of the Coast of <hi>Italy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A defeate of <hi>Hanibals</hi> ships, for want of a good Wind.</note> he
fell vnaduisedly into their Army, which was in order and in Battell,
where he was suddainly charged, so as he lost in a manner all his ships,
and saued himselfe with very few contrary to his Hope, and the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all the VVorld.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romanes</hi> after this defeate, approached neerer vnto <hi>Sicily,</hi> and
being aduertised by the Prisoners of the Consuls ouer-throw, they sent
speedily to <hi>Caius Duellius</hi> Consull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hauing at that time the charge of
the Army by Land: Where hauing attended some space, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
newes that the Enemies Army at Sea was not farre off, they all
prepared to battell. They planted vpon euery one of their ships, (for
that they were ill built and heauy,) a kind of Engine,<note place="margin">An Engine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented by the <hi>Romans</hi> called a Rauen.</note> which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
called a Rauen; behold the fashion of this Engine. They did
set a Pillar or Mast of foure fathome long, and nine inches thicke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the Prowe, the which had also a pulley on the top, and one the
side was made an assent of boards all along, the which was foure foot
broade and foure fathome long; the passage was turning about the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
in the two first fathomes of the assent: About the which were
barres of eyther side to the height of a mans knee, and they had set at
the end of it an Iron like vnto a pestell, which went vp streight, the
which had on the top of it a King, so as altogether seemed as an Engine
wherewith they pound things. To this Ring was fastned a cord, by
meanes whereof at the encounter of the ships, they fastned the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens
by the pulley, and let them fall vpon their Enemies ships. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
at the Prowe, sometimes on the side in turning, when as they
could not assaile them by the flanke; and after that the Rauens were
fastned within the bands of the ships, and that the Vessels were grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and fast, if they found themselues vpon the side, they entred it
of all sides: And if it were by the Prowe, they marcht by the bridge
two and two to the Combate, whereof the first couered their bodies
with their Targets, and they which followed defended the flankes,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16537:16"/>
and held their Targets euen with the bars. When as this Equipage at
Sea was ready, they attended a conuenient time for the battell. When
as <hi>Caius Duelius</hi> had beene suddainly aduertised, of the mis-fortune of
the Commaunder at Sea, he left that at Land to the Tribunes of the
men of Warre, and makes hast to that at Sea. And being aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> spoyl'd the Country of <hi>Myles,</hi> hee drew
thither with his whole Army: But when the Enemy was certayne of
his comming, they were in great hope, thinking the <hi>Romanes</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
not any thing in Sea-fights. Wherefore they drew out to Sea,
with an Equipage of sixe score and ten Vessels, thinking this War not
worthy of any order of battell, as if they had gone to a certaine booty.
Whereof this <hi>Haniball</hi> who (as wee sayd) retyred his Army by night,
and past ouer the Enemies Trenches,) was Commaunder. He had a
Vessell of seauen bankes which did sometimes belong to <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King
of the <hi>Epirotes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When as the two Armies beganne to approach, and that their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
called Rauens were discouered, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were a time
in suspence for the nouelty. Finally whatsoeuer it were, without any
further reckoning they charge with great fury. The ships ioyn'd and
grapled,<note place="margin">A battel at Sea betwixt the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </note> so as the <hi>Romane</hi> souldiers by meanes of their Engines called
Rauens, entred their enemies ships, where there was a great slaughter
made of the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> The rest being amazed at this kind of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines,
yeilded: you would haue sayd it had beene a battell at Land,
where the danger is not lesse. The thirty Vessells of the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
which gaue the first Charge were taken, among the which was
that of the Captayne, which we haue sayd had belonged vnto King
<hi>Pyrrhus. Haniball</hi> whose Fortune was otherwise then he expected, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
himselfe in a little Skiffe: The rest of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Army came
with great fury agaynst their Enemies, as the former had done; but
when they were aduertised that their first ships had beene taken by the
meanes of the Engines, they did not charge in Front, thinking to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde
them, but came vpon their flanke, trusting to the lightnesse of
their Vessels, thinking by this meanes to auoyde the violence of their
Engines;<note place="margin">The flight of the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
               </note> but they were made in such sort as of what side soeuer the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
approached, they could easily grapple with them. Wherefore
the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> amazed with the strangenesse of these Engines, in
the end fled, after the losse of fifty of their ships.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> being now become masters of the Sea, contrary vnto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
their Hope, sayl'd about the Sea towards <hi>Segestane,</hi> and raysed the

                  <hi>Macelle</hi> taken by assault.</note> Then parting from thence, they
tooke the Towne of <hi>Macelle</hi> by assault. After this battell at Sea,
when as <hi>Amilcar</hi> (being then Captayne Generall in <hi>Sicily</hi> of the Army
by Land) was aduertised, remayning at <hi>Panorme,</hi> that there was a
great quarrell betwixt the <hi>Romanes</hi> and their-Allies, touching the
prowesse and glory of the Combate,<note place="margin">A defeate of foure thousand men, allied to the <hi>Romans</hi> by <hi>Amilcar.</hi>
               </note> and that the Allies after they
had beene beaten, were retired apart betwixt <hi>Prope</hi> and <hi>Termine,</hi> hee
marcht with all speed to the Allies Campe, and slew foure thousand
by surprize. <hi>Haniball</hi> after all these Fortunes, retyred to <hi>Carthage,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:16537:16"/>
with those few ships which he had remaining at the battell. Within
few dayes after he was dispatch to goe with an Army into <hi>Sardinia,</hi>
with some excellent Sea Captaines, but he was soone inclos'd in a Port
by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and in a manner lost his whole Army: And as he had
escaped the Enemy, he was suddainly taken by the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
which had saued themselues, and was crucofied.<note place="margin">

            <p>The yeare following there was not any thing done worthy of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
in <hi>Sicily</hi> by the Roman Army. <hi>Caius Sulpicius,</hi> and <hi>Aulus Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilius</hi>
were afterwards made Consuls, and sent to <hi>Palermo,</hi> for that the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> forces wintred there. And after the <hi>Romans</hi> had past,
they put themselues in battell before the Towne: But the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
being within it, presented not themselues to battell.<note place="margin">

was taken likewise by the Consuls, hauing held out sometime by reason
of the scituation of the place. And as they had besieged the Citty

of <hi>Aulus Rutilius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aulus Rutilius <hi>Consull.</hi>

the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> saw that some did but imbarque, others began to set
saile, and the first were farre from their Fleet, and neere vnto them; they
turned with incredible swiftnesse, and compast them in, so as most part
of them were sunke, and the Consuls ship had like to haue fallen into
the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> hands, with all that were within it: He hardly esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
by the force of his Oares and lightnesse.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the rest of the Romane Army, which had gotten

But howsoeuer either of them parted from this Combate with
an Opinion to haue gotten the Victory: Wherefore they were more
eager to continue the War by Sea, and were more attentiue to Marrine
affaires. As for their Armies at Land, during this time, they did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
worthy of Note, busying themselues about small things, and of

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16537:17"/>
from thence went to <hi>Heracleum,</hi> and so to <hi>Minoe.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi>
intention was to passe into <hi>Affricke,</hi> and there to make their chiefe
War, to the end the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> should not onely run the hazard of
the War of <hi>Sicily,</hi> but also haue it at their owne Houses. On the
otherside the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> considering how easily their descent would
be into <hi>Lybia,</hi> and what little defence the Countrey-men would make
when they should be once entred, they desired to fight presently with
the <hi>Romans,</hi> and by that meanes to hinder the descent into <hi>Affricke.</hi>
Wherefore the one being resolued to defend themselues, and the other
to assaile them, considering the obstinacy of either party, there was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-hood
of an vndoubted battell. When as the <hi>Romans</hi> had giuen order
for all things necessary for the equipage of their Sea-army, and to make
their descent into <hi>Affricke,</hi> they made choice of the ablest men in all their
Army at Land, and imbark'd them, and then deuided their Army into
foure, whereof either had two Names. The first was called the first Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion,
and the first Army: So were the rest according to their order, but
the fourth and the third were called <hi>Triarij,</hi> as in an Army at Land. Al
this Army at Sea amounted to aboue 140000.<note place="margin">An Army of 140000. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and more <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>
               </note> men. Euery Vessell
had three hundred Rowers, and sixe score Leginaries.</p>
            <p>In regard of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> they were furnished onely with men
accustomed with Sea-fights, being in number aboue 150000. men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the order of their Vessels. Wherefore they that were present
and saw the great danger, and power of the two Armies, the great char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
the multitude of combatants, and of ships, they did not only wonder,
but they also who heard speake of it. The <hi>Romans</hi> considering that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
necessity they must goe vpon the side, and that their Enemies sayl'd
more lightly, they imployed all their Art to make their battell strong
and inuincible. For the effecting whereof they set two Vessels in front
of sixe Bankes in equall distance, in the which were <hi>Marcus Attilius,</hi> and
<hi>Lucius Manlius.</hi> After which march'd the first and second Battalion of
either side, their ships following one another, so as the distance of the
two Battalions did still inlarge themselues. The stems of their ships loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
outward. By this meanes the Battalions drawne thus in length, made
the two parts of a Triangle, to the which they added the third Battalion
in the same fashion, as a foundation, so as the three Battalions made a
perfect sigure of a Triangle. After the third Battalion the ships which
carried the Horses, were ordered one after another, seruing as a Rampie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to the third Battalion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Triarij</hi> followed after in their order, making the fourth Battali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
euery Vessell being ordered in such sort, as they past the precedent
on either side. All the Romane Army was thus ordered, whereof the
first part, that is to say, the two sides of the point of the Triangle, were
empty in the midst: but the sides following after the foundation were
better supplied.<note place="margin">A Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance made by the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to the Souldiers of their Army.</note> By this means their Army was firme and hard to breake.
In the meane time the Commaunders of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> drew their
Souldiers together, and put courage into them, letting them vnderstand,
that if they wone the battell, there would be no more War but in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily:</hi>
But if the <hi>Romans</hi> had the Victory, they must expect not to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16537:17"/>
fight for <hi>Sicily,</hi> but for their owne Countrey, their Houses and their
Children.</p>
            <p>After this exhortation, they make them imbarque; the which they
did resolutely, and prepared to fight, thinking of the time to come, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the discourse of their Captaines: Who seeing the order of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, deuided theirs likewise into foure; whereof three gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Sea, making the Right-wing longer, stayed as if they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron
their Enemies, against whom they turne their beake-heads; and
they make the Fort to looke towards the Land, by a circuite of the Left
wing of the whole Army. <hi>Hanno</hi> and <hi>Amilcar</hi> were Commaunders of
the <hi>Carthaginians, Hanno</hi> (who was defeated at the battell of <hi>Agragas</hi>)
had the leading of the Right wing, with the lightest Vessels, and <hi>Amilcar</hi>
of the Left. This is he who as we haue sayd, fought at Sea neere vnto
<hi>Tyndaris,</hi> who hazarding then the middest of his Army, vsed this
kind of Stratagem of War for the Combate.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> seeing at the first charge, that the Battalion of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi>
was weake, forc'd resolutely thorough them: But the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi>
obseruing the Commaundment of <hi>Amilcar,</hi> left the place
presently, making shew to flye, to the end the <hi>Roman</hi> Army should se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
it selfe, whom the <hi>Romans</hi> followed with too great heate: And
therefore the first and second Battalion sayl'd with too great Courage
after the Enemy, but the third and fourth were stayed, drawing after
them the ships that were laden with Horses, with whom the <hi>Triarij</hi>
remained for their Guard.<note place="margin">A Battell at Sea betwixt the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>
               </note> When as the two first seemed to be farre
from the others, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>

as he had instructed them, turning the Prow suddainly, they all
assault the Roman Vessels which followed them.</p>
            <p>The Combat was cruell; It is true, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had a great
aduantage by their lightnesse, and their pollicy in turning: But when
as they came to fight, and that the Armies affronted one another, the
<hi>Romans</hi> had no lesse hope then the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> for the Force and
Prowesse of their men; and by the staying of their Ships, and casting
of their Engines, and finally by the Combate of the two Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and the hazard they were in their fight.</p>
            <p>This was the estate of the Battell: Presently after <hi>Hanno,</hi> who as
we haue sayd had the charge of the Right wing, and did not budge
before the first charge was giuen, seeing the Battell begun with the
<hi>Romans,</hi> went to Sea and charged the <hi>Triarij,</hi> where there was a
great fight, the which was long in suspence. In the meane time the
fourth Battalion of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> which continued neere the
shore, turning the Prow vpon the Enemy, assaulted the Battalion in
front, by the which the ships which carried the Horses were towed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
who suddainly slipt the Ropes and fought with great fury.</p>
            <p>There they saw three parts of the Battell, and three Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats
at Sea at one instant, in three diuers places, and farre remote. The
Combate was equall, for that the Ships of eyther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> side were
of the like number. Without doubt euery man performed his
Duty in fighting, so as all was indifferent and equall. Finally,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16537:18"/>
               <hi>Amilcar</hi> was defeated, and forced to flye with his Squadron.<note place="margin">Amilcar <hi>van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished.</hi>
               </note> And
<hi>Lucius Manlius</hi> towed away the ships that were taken. In the meane
time <hi>Attilius</hi> seeing the Combate of the <hi>Triarij,</hi> and of the ships
wherein the Horses were, came presently to succour them with the
Vessels of the second Battalion, which were yet whole and entire: But
when as the <hi>Triarij</hi> who had beene long and violently charged by <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi>
so as they were in great danger, saw the Consull come, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
courage, and recharged him resolutely: And then then the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
being much discontented to haue an Enemy in front and behinde,
and to be inuested by succours contrary to their expectation, gained
the open Sea, relying vpon the lightnesse of their Vessels, and saued
themselues by flight. And <hi>Lucius Manlius</hi> in the meane time seeing
the third Battalion prest neere the shore by the left wing of the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
and <hi>Marcus Attilius</hi> in like manner, leauing the ships with
the Horses and the <hi>Triarij</hi> in safety, resolued both together to succour
those that were in danger: For they were in a manner besieged, and
almost at the last gaspe, and had beene defeated, if the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
had not feared to ioyne with them by reason of their Engines or Rauens:
Neither did they presse vpon them, but onely to chase them to the
shore. Finally, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were suddainly compast in by the
Consuls, whereof fifty of their ships were taken with the men.<note place="margin">A Victory of the <hi>Romans</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaggnians.</hi>

There was not one <hi>Roman</hi> Vessell taken whole by the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>

But when he was come to the Citty of <hi>Adis</hi> which was worthy of a

Raise the siege. And therefore they march with all their power against
the <hi>Romans,</hi> Recouering a little Hill to the preiudice of their Enemies,
and very commodious for themselues: Whereon planting their Camp,
they hoped for an absolute Victory, by the meanes of their Horse and
Elephants. Leauing therefore the playne, they drew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> high and
vneuen places, as if they would aduertise the Enemy what they had to
doe, the which vndoubtedly they effected. For when the <hi>Romanes</hi>
had considered the little vse of Elephants, for they were in a Mountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
and Hilly Country, in the which the Enemies had setled their
chiefe hope, as of great effect and terrible, they aduised not to attend
their Descent into the playne: Wherefore vsing the opportunity of the
time, they shut them vp at the breake of day in the Mountayne of all

            <p>By this meanes their Cauallery and their Elephants were altogether
vnprofitable: Their aduenturers onely did their duties in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all sides, abandoned their Fort, and fled into the deserts of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.
The Elephants and Horses recouered the Playne, and saued
themselues without danger. The <hi>Romans</hi> made some little pursuite after
the footemen, then they spoyled the Campe, and ouer-ran the whole
Country, wasting all, and ruining the Towne.</p>
            <p>Some few dayes after they besieged <hi>Tunes,</hi>

vnto them to mannage the Warre, being a frontier to <hi>Carthage</hi>
and to the whole Prouince. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> hauing a little before
beene defeated at Sea, and now by Land, not by the cowardize of their
Souldiers, but by the basenesse of the Commanders, they fell into a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
and desperate estate: For after their last defeate and flight by the
<hi>Romans,</hi> a great Troupe of <hi>Numidians,</hi> gaping after spoyle, fell vpon
them,<note place="margin">The <hi>Nunidians</hi> great robbers.</note> doing them in a manner as great harme as the <hi>Romans.</hi> It is a

by famine, as for their owne cowardize, and moreouer the multitude
being great they feared a long siege: And although that <hi>Marcus Attil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
was perswaded that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were wonderfully weakned,
aswell by Land as Sea, being in hope that the City would be in short

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>. Wherefore they sent the chiefe of their City in
Embassie to the Consull, to make this treaty. But when as they were
arriued, they were so farre from agreeing, as they could hardly without
choller heare the vnreasonable things that were enioyn'd them. Make
your account that <hi>Marcus Attilius</hi> did hope that his offer would bee
accepted as a thing of grace, for that he had preuayled in all his affaires:
The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> on the other side, thought that when as fortune
should reduce them to extremity, the Consull could not make them a
more bitter answere.</p>
            <p>Their Embassadours therefore returned, not onely without any agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

proud. The which being heard by the Senate of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> they
entered into so great an indignation vpon the Consuls demaund, and
resumed such courage, that although formerly they were out of hope,
yet then they resolued to attend all extremities, and rather to trye their
fortune, and to attend the time, then to suffer so ignominious a thing and
vnworthy of their valour. It happened a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the same time, that some one
of those which had beene sent into <hi>Greece,</hi> in the beginning of the warre
to Leuie Men, returned and brought with them a good number of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers:
among the which there was one <hi>Xantippus</hi> a <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Xantippus <hi>a</hi> Lacedemonian.</note> a man
of Iudgement, and practised in the warre: who after that hee had heard
a relation of the defeat of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and the manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the place,
and that what time it happened; hauing also considered the equipage of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16537:19"/>
the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> with the number of their Horses and Elephants, he
returned suddainly to his Companions, saying, that the ignorance of
the Captaines, not the <hi>Romans,</hi> had defeated the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> This
speech ran presently thoroughout the whole Citty, and came vnto the
Princes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> caused him to be called, and resolued to vse his
Councell, who in their presence deliuered plainly the Reasons of his
speech, and the cause of their Defeate; and if they would follow his
Councell, and hereafter keepe the Plaines, leauing the hilly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and there plant their battell, hee would teach them how their
Army should be out of danger, and their Enemies Vanquished. The
Captaines mooued with the words of <hi>Xantippus,</hi> presently Resigned
vnto him the Conduct of all this Warre,<note place="margin">The Leading of the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi> Army, giuen to <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tippus.</hi>
               </note> and now there ranne a bruite
throughout the whole Campe of <hi>Xantippus</hi> speech, with great Hope
and Ioy. But after that all the Companies of the Army were drawne
into the field, and that hee had put them is order, there was so great
a difference betwixt his and that of the other Captaines, who vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
not the Art of Warre, that presently the common cry deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
nothing but to fight, so much they were assured vnder the leading
of <hi>Xantippus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This done, the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Captaines seeing the courage of their
Men, exhorted them a little according to the opportunity of the time,
and within few dayes after they marched to find out the Enemy. There
were in the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> Army aboue twelue thousand foote, foure
thousand Horse, and neere a hundred Elephants. When as <hi>Marcus
Attilius</hi> heard of the comming of the Enemy, and that the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
kept their Horses vpon an euen Country, camping contrary vnto
their custome on the plaines, hee wondred as at a new accident: Yet
hee marcht directly to them desiring battell, and lodged within twelue
hundred paces of their Campe. Three dayes after the <hi>Carthaginian</hi>
Captaines held a Councell what was to be done: But the multitude de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
the combate, turned towards <hi>Xantippus,</hi> calling him by his
name, with a countenance see<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ing to be willing and ready to vndergo
all dangers, and intreated him to lead them speedily vnto the battell.
When as the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Captaines saw their Men thus resolute, and
desirous to fight, and that <hi>Xantippus</hi> sayd the time was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>itting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient,
they suffred them to prepare to battell, and gaue him leaue
to do all at his pleasure. Who after he had taken charge of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
hee orders the battell,<note place="margin">The order of the bat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> before the whole Army hee sets the
Elephants one after another. After which hee causeth a Legion of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi>
to march, with some distance, and placeth the strangers
vpon the Wings. Then he ordereth the brauest among his foote, to
fight of eyther side betwixt the Wings of the Horse-men.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> seeing the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in battell, stayed not to doe
the like; yet fearing the Violence of the Elephants, they set in Front
the most actiue of their men, re-inforcing their Reare with many En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes,
and diuiding their Horse-men vpon the Wings. Their Ordo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
was lesse then formerly, but more close, for feare least the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:16537:20"/>
should open them. But as the <hi>Romans</hi> had set a good order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Elephants, so they had neglected to keepe themselues from
inclosing. For as the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had a greater number of Horse, so
the close Ordonance, gaue them an easie meanes to breake and seperate
them.</p>
            <p>The two Armies being in battell,<note place="margin">Battell giuen by the <hi>Romans</hi> to the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians.</hi>
               </note> either attending who should first
Charge; suddainly <hi>Xantippus</hi> causeth the Elephants to beginne the
Charge, and breake the Enemies rankes, and that the Horse-men of
both Wings should withall charge furiously. The <hi>Romanes</hi> cause their
Trumpets to sound after the manner of the Country, and charge where
the Enemies forces were greatest. It is true that the <hi>Roman</hi> Horse-men
terrified with the multitude of their Enemies, abandoned the two
Wings: And the Foote-men of the lest Wing wauing from the Fury
of the Elephants, and making no account of the forreigne Souldiers,
charged the right Wing of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> with great fury, and put
it to flight, pursuing them vnto their Fort. On the other side, they
which indured the charge of the Elephants, were broken and trodden
vnder their feete by heapes. It is true that the whole Ordnance conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
for a time in battell, for that their supplies beeing in the Reare
were very close. But after that the <hi>Romane</hi> Legions, set in the Reare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and compassed in of all sides by the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Horse-men,
were forced to make resistance there, and that they (who as wee haue
sayd) were appointed to make head against the Elephants, were by
them repulsed into the thickest of the enemies Battalion, where they
were defeated and slaine,<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> then the <hi>Romans</hi> beeing assaulted on all sides,
some were beaten downe and slaine by the intollerable fury of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants,
and others by the Horse-men, in the same place where they
had their first posture giuen them, some few of them seeing no more
hope,<note place="margin">

               </note> sought their safety by flight, of which (considering that the
Country was very plaine) some were defeated by the Elephants, and
the rest by the Horse-men: And some flying with <hi>Marcus Attilius,</hi> were
taken to the number of fiue hundred.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> lost that day but fiue hundred Aduenturers stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
whom the left Wing of the <hi>Romanes</hi> had defeated: But of all the
<hi>Romane</hi> Army there escaped but two thousand with their Ensignes, who
(as we haue sayd) pursued a troupe of enemies into their Fort. All the
rest were cut in pieces, except <hi>Marcus Attilius</hi> and a few Men which
fled with him; in regard of those Ensignes which beyond all hope es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped,
they came vnto <hi>Aspis.</hi> Finally the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> after the
spoile of the Dead retired to <hi>Carthage,</hi> with the Consull and other
Prisoners, making great ioy and tryumph.</p>
            <p>If we shall duely consider this,<note place="margin">Aremonstrance of <hi>Polybius.</hi>
               </note> we shall finde many things profitable
for the conduct of Man. First, <hi>Marcus Attilius</hi> serues for a faire exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to all the World, that it is a great folly and indiscretion, to put
his Hope in Fortune, vnder the colour of good successe and enterprises
brought to an end according to our desire: Who of late after so many
tryumphant Victories, had not any compassion of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
being reduced to extremity, refusing to grant them peace, which they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:16537:20"/>
craued with so much humility, hath beene presently after reduced to
that constraint, as to make the like request.</p>
            <p>Moreouer that which <hi>Euripides</hi> hath formerly spoken so well, that
the good Councell of one man alone doth vanquish a great Army, hath
beene this day verified by that which hath happened. In truth one
man alone, and the Councell of one man, hath vanquished and defeated
an Army, formerly invincible; raising and restoring a Towne lost, and
the hearts of so many desolate men. Beleeue mee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I haue thought good
to relate these actions for the benefit and instruction of the Readers of
these Commentaries.</p>
            <p>For as there are two meanes easily to correct and amend our
errours, whereof the one is his owne Misfortune, and the other the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of another mans Miseries; there is no doubt but the first hath
greater efficacy, but it is not without the losse and preiudice of him to
whom it happens: And although the second be not of so great force,
yet it is the better for that they are out of danger, and therefore no
man imbraceth the first meanes willingly, for that they cannot helpe it
without their owne trouble and losse. As for the second, euer man fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
it willingly; For wee may see by him (without any hazard
or losse) what wee ought to follow for the best.</p>
            <p>Wherefore if wee consider it well, we shall finde that experience
(by the remembrance of another mans faults) seemes to be a very good
doctrine of a true life: Without doubt it is that alone which makes
the good Iudges of reason without any losse: But wee haue discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
sufficiently of this Subiect.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> hauing ended their affaires happily, and to their
content, they reioyced in many sorts, both in giuing thankes vnto
God; and sacrificing after their manner, or in vsing amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
a mutuall beneuolence and courtesie.</p>
            <p>Soone after that <hi>Xantippus</hi> had raised the hearts of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Xantippus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes into his Countrey.</note>
hee returned into his Countrey, as a man well aduised: For the Prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esse
and Valour of men, and their Vertues, are many times the cause of
great enuy and detraction: Against the which Cittizens that are well
allied, and haue many Friends, make easie resistance: But strangers
which haue not that support, are easily ruined and defeated. They
say hee went away for some other reason, which wee will deliuer when
it shall be fitting.</p>
            <p>After that beyond all hope the <hi>Romans</hi> had receiued Newes of
the defeate of their Army in <hi>Affricke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aspis <hi>besieged by the</hi> Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians.</note> and the taking of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sull:
And that the remainder of their men was besieged in <hi>Aspis,</hi>
consulting presently of the safety of those which were remaining in
<hi>Affricke,</hi> they appointed an Army to bee raised to goe thither with
all speede.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the <hi>Carthagaginians</hi> besieged <hi>Aspis,</hi> striuing to
force it, with hope soone to haue this remainder of the Battell: But
the Vertue and Courage of the <hi>Romans</hi> which defended it, was so
great, as all the Enemies attempts could not preuaile. Wherefore
being out of hope to enter it, they rais'd the Siege. Soone after
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:16537:21"/>
Newes came that the <hi>Romans</hi> prepared an Army at Sea to send into

with the whole Army into <hi>Affricke</hi> in the beginning of the Spring.
When as the Consuls had set sayle, to draw first into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and from

            <p>But when they had past the Sea betwixt <hi>Affricke</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> with a
prosperous Winde, and had anchored neere vnto the <hi>Camarins</hi> Towne,
it is not possible to deliuer the greatnesse of the torment and misery that
befell them. Hardly could they preserue foure score Vessels whole
of foure hundred three score and foure which were in their Army.<note place="margin">A great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ships perished by a Tempest.</note> All
the rest (either sunke in the Sea, or split against the Rocks) fill'd all the
shore with wracks, or dead Bodies.</p>
            <p>It is not in the memory of man of any such shipwracke by a tempest.
This miserable misfortune happened not casually and by chance, but by
the ouerweening of the Consuls, considering that the Marriners had
let them vnderstand, that they must auoid the Coasts aboue <hi>Sicily,</hi> for
that it was not to be approached, being bad and difficult to sayle in, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
at that season, for they sayled betwixt the Starres of <hi>Orion</hi>
and the <hi>Dog-starre.</hi> Whatsoeuer it were the Consuls disdaining the
admonition of the Marriners, made hast with a glorious confidence of
their late Victory, to surprize some Townes a long that shore: where
as they fell into extreame calamity vnder the shaddow of a poore hope.
Then they knew their folly, carrying the repentance of their presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Defacing by this wracke the things which formerly they had
done well.</p>
            <p>And although that in all things the <hi>Romans</hi> relye vpon their forces,
and thinke whatsoeuer they resolue, must be put in execution, holding
nothing impossible when they haue once vndertaken it, and that this
obstinacy doth many times turne to good. Yet sometimes they fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
great and apparent errours, especially in Sea-matters. It is true that
in Battels at Land fighting with men, it is not so strange if they van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish:
For the Combate is equall, although they bee sometimes
vanquished: But as for the Sea, for that they thrust themselues into
hazard, and without consideration, they fall many times into great
inconueniences.</p>
            <p>This happened at this time, and hath done formerly, and will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
them many times hereafter, vntill they haue supprest and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:16537:21"/>
reformed this ouer-weening, thinking they are able to goe to Sea at all
seasons. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> being aduertised of the shipwracke of the
Romane Army, they had the greater desire to raise an Army both by
Land and Sea: For that their force seemed as great at Land, as that of
the <hi>Romans,</hi> by reason of the defeate of <hi>Marcus Attilius:</hi> The like they
conceiued of the Sea, after the great losse the <hi>Romans</hi> had indured.
Wherefore they presently sent <hi>Asdruball</hi> into <hi>Sicily</hi> with the old Bands,
and a new leuie of the Men of <hi>Heracleum,</hi> with an hundred and fifty Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants.
They wrigd out a Fleete of two hundred Vessels,<note place="margin">Asdruball <hi>sent into</hi> Sicily <hi>by the</hi> Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> and other
Equipages necessary for Nauigation. When as <hi>Asdruball</hi> landed at
<hi>Lylibeum</hi> with his whole Army, he trayned his Men, and exercised
his Elephants, making roads into those Countries which were allied
vnto the <hi>Romans.</hi> Finally, he was very watchfull and dilligent. And
although the <hi>Romans</hi> losse had much abated their courage, yet they v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
all possible diligence to rayse a Fleete of two hundred and twenty
Vessels with a Pallisado: the which they effected within three Moneths,
and put it to Sea, the which is difficult to beleene, to the end the
World should not thinke they would strike sayle vnto the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
Lucius Aquilius,</hi> and <hi>Caius Cornelius</hi> Consuls, were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to leade this Army, to fight with the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> who
passing the Sea presently, arriued at <hi>Messina,</hi> where they receiued
the Remainder of the ships, which had beene preserued in the storme.
By this meanes their Army consisted of three hundred Vessels.</p>
            <p>From thence they tooke their Course to <hi>Palermo,</hi> the chiefe Towne
of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> the which they assailed vigourously,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Palermo</hi> besse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by assault.</note> erecting
two sorts of Engines, and other preparations to that effect, so as they
easily ouerthrow a Tower seated vpon the Sea, by the which the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
entring by force, tooke that part of the Towne which was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Naples.</hi> After this the Burgesses dying for feare, yeelded vnto the
Consuls the other part which they called the old Towne.</p>
            <p>After the taking of <hi>Palermo,</hi> the Consuls put in a good Garrison, and
then returned to <hi>Rome.</hi> The yeare following, <hi>Gneus Sempronius,</hi> and
<hi>Caius Seruilius</hi> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re Consuls, who in like manner past into <hi>Sicily</hi>
with an Army, to goe from thence into <hi>Affricke:</hi> where being
arriued, they dispersed their Men into diuers places, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
great spoiles, yet they did not any thing worthy of Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Finally, they arriued at the Island of <hi>Lotophages,</hi> which they
call <hi>Mirmyx,</hi> which is neere vnto a little Shelfe or Barre of <hi>Barbary,</hi>
where not knowing the passages, they were in a great streight, and
were stayed by reason of the ebbing of the Sea: They were for a
time in suspence what to doe. Finally, the Flood comming sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
vpon them, they were almost driuen to dispaire: Yet they could
not saue themselues vntill they had lightned their ships, and cast out
their baggage to saue themselues.</p>
            <p>After that Day the <hi>Romans</hi> were so amazed with so many dangers,
as they sailed continuallly as if they had fled. Soone after they
returned into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and leauing <hi>Lilybeum,</hi> they tooke Port at <hi>Palermo.</hi>
But soone after that they were gone from thence to saile into <hi>Italy,</hi> there
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16537:22"/>
rose so great a storme as aboue a hundred and fifty of their ships were
driuen vp and downe,<note place="margin">One hundred and fifty of the <hi>Roman</hi> Vessels lost.</note> and in the end perished. And although the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi>
after so many losses, were of aduice to preferre the honor and
Maiesty of the Empire before all other things, yet they were so broken
with so great miseries, as they resolued to abandon the Sea. And
therefore they only leuied an Army by Land, wherein they thought they
should be more confident and of better hope, the which they sent into
<hi>Sicily</hi> with the two Consuls, <hi>Lucius Cecilius,</hi> and <hi>Caius Curius:</hi> To
whom they deliuered only three score Vessells for their Victualls. By
this meanes the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> became againe Maisters of the Sea with
out contradiction, seeing the <hi>Romans</hi> had no more any Fleete at Sea.
Moreouer they had great confidence in their Army at Land, and not
without cause. For after that the report of the battell giuen in <hi>Affricke,</hi>
came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and that they vnderstood that the defeate of their men
hapned by the force and fury of the Elephants, for that they had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Rankes and opened the battalions, and that they had made a
wonderfull slaughter of them.</p>
            <p>Their feare of the Elephants from that day, was so great, as for
two yeares after they neuer durst charge the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> although
they made many incounters in <hi>Affricke,</hi> and in the Country of <hi>Selinun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi>
nor Campe in the Plaines within fiue or sixe furlongs of them, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

from the Elephants;<note place="margin">Theruce <hi>and</hi> Lipara.</note> so as they only forced <hi>Theruce</hi> and <hi>Lipara.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Romanes</hi> knowing the feare their Army had, resolued againe
to put a Fleete to Sea.</p>
            <p>At that time the <hi>Romane</hi> people being assembled, they chose vnto the
Consulship <hi>Caius Attilius,</hi> and <hi>Lucius Manlius:</hi> They also made
fifty new ships,<note place="margin">A new Army at Sea, prepared by the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </note> and Rigg'd out the olde, the which they furnished
with Souldiers proportionably. When as <hi>Asdruball</hi> Generall of the
<hi>Carthaginians,</hi> knowing well the feare of the <hi>Romans,</hi> had beene ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised
by the Fugitiues, that one of the Consuls was returned vnto
<hi>Rome</hi> with halfe the Army, and <hi>Cecilius</hi> remayned alone at <hi>Palermo</hi>
with the other, he parts from <hi>Lylibeum</hi> (when as Haruest approached)
with his Army to spoile, and falls vpon the Territory of <hi>Palermo,</hi> plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Campe vpon the Mountaines. <hi>Cecilius</hi> hauing newes of their
comming, and knowing that <hi>Asdruball</hi> desired nothing but a battell,
kept his Army within the Towne.</p>
            <p>By this meanes <hi>Asdruball</hi> growing very confident, conceiuing that
<hi>Cecilius</hi> kept himselfe close for feare, he causeth his Army to March
to <hi>Palermo,</hi> hauing ruined and burnt all the Champion Countries. The
Consull was alwaies of opinion not to go to field, vntill that his enemy
was drawne to passe the Riuer, which runnes neere vnto the Towne

afterwards considering that matters had succeeded as he desired, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daines
the lightest and most actiue, to plant themselues beyond the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16537:22"/>
Towne ditch, giuing them charge to cast Pertuisans, Darts, and Spits
a farre off at the Elephants: And if they came running vpon them with
fury and violence, they should slip into the Ditch, and from thence
cast their Darts at them. He also commaunded the Archers of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
place, to go out of the Towne, and to fight at the foote of the wall.
In the meane time, he issued foorth with all the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Presently after the skirmish beganne, the Maister of the Elephants,
who with a desire of glory would haue the honour of the Victory, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed
them against the enemies, not attending <hi>Asdrubals</hi> pleasure.
The <hi>Romans</hi> obseruing the Consuls commaundment, turned head pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently;
and when as the Elephants pursued them with fury, they slipt
into the Ditch, the Elephants being vppon the side of it, they were
suddainly charged with Darts and Pertuisans, aswell by the Townes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
which were vpon the Walls, as from the Souldiers which lay in
the Ditch. And when as they could passe no further, they turned
head, being necessarily forced to fall vpon their owne battallions with
great slaughter.</p>
            <p>In the meane time <hi>Cecilius</hi> goes suddainly to field, hauing his whole

for the taking of the Elephants, whereby the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> power
was much decreased, as for that their men seemed to be grown<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

courage, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

swiftly and enters the Port, the which no man would haue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined,
and puts his Army safe into <hi>Lylibeum.</hi> It is incredible the
ioy which they within the Towne conceiued, after their succours were
entred, not so much for the refreshing of men, but for that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi>
durst not hinder the entry of the ships.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Imilcon</hi> Commaunder of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> seeing that the
Souldiers demaunded nothing but to fight, aswell the old Garrison, in
regard of their supplies, but the new succours, for that they had not
felt the former miseries; he would not loose this opportunity, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
to set fire on the <hi>Romanes</hi> Engines by what meanes soeuer. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when hee had drawne them altogether, hee made a speech vnto
them, promising good rewards to such as should shew themselues braue
Men: And assured them that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> would acknowledge it.
The Souldiers mooued with these speeches, told them that they were
ready to do their duties. Moreouer they cryed out with a loud voyce,
intreating him that without any further stay he would lead them to fight.
<hi>Imilcon</hi> commending their courage, sent them to refresh themselues,
and gaue them charge to be ready, and to performe that which their
Captaines should commaund them: Whom presently after hee drawes
a part, and acquaints them with his interprize; then hee appoints vnto
euery one his Quarter and place, commaunding them that euery one
should retire speedily in the beginning of the night, the which they
performed.</p>
            <p>At the breake of day <hi>Imilcon</hi> made his sallies in many places, and
fell vpon the Engines. The Romans who doubted the enemies designe,
were not negligent, but were all in Armes keeping a good Guard.
Wherefore as soone as the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> beganne their sally, they
marcht against them, so as the Allarum was great neere vnto the walls.
The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were about twenty thousand men, and the <hi>Romanes</hi>
many more. And for that the combate was without any order of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
the danger was the greater: For in so great a multitude of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
they did fight Man to Man, as if it had beene a single combate.
It is true, that the heate of the fight, and the greatest Allarum was
neere vnto the Engines. Beleeue that they which were appointed, aswel
by the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> to assaile, as by the <hi>Romanes</hi> for defence, cam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to so great and cruell a combate, as they dyed with incredible Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
neuer abandoning the place which they had beene ordain'd them.
But they which were mingled in fighting, cast themselues vpon the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi>
with such great courage, assailing the Engines with fires, Darts,
and such like Armes, as the <hi>Romans</hi> that day, seeing themselues not
able to resist the enemies interprize, thought in a manner all to bee vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
lost.</p>
            <p>When as the combate had continued long, <hi>Imilcon</hi> seeing the great
losse of his men, and that he could not preuayle, he caused a Retreate
to be sounded. And although the <hi>Romanes</hi> were that day in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to loose all their equipage for battery, yet in the end they defended
their Engines, and all their furniture, resisting the enemies with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
valour.</p>

After these actions, <hi>Hanniball</hi> parting in the Night from <hi>Lylibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>

brought with him, hee sayled to <hi>Tripanum</hi> to <hi>Adherball,</hi> who was

to the <hi>Romans</hi> of so great boldnesse, wherein hee was animated,
for that a little before the route that was made vnto him by dilligens
experience: But suddainly when hee was discouered, hee turned
his Prowe directly to the Tower which stands vpon the Sea towards
<hi>Italy;</hi> so as they which looke to <hi>Lybia</hi> were in sight to all Men:
which was the onely meanes whereby Saylers might with a good wind

they cast great store of earth vpon them, yet they lost their labour and
time, for the great depth swallowed all; and the ebbing and flowing
of the Sea dispersed whatsoeuer they cast in. Finally, there was some
part, which by chance had made a Barre or Banke, where suddainly a
<hi>Carthaginian Quadrireme</hi> sent in the Night was stayed: After the
taking whereof, being well armed and furnished in the Port, the
<hi>Romans</hi> attended the comming of others, especially of the <hi>Rhodien</hi>

had beene taken by the <hi>Romans.</hi> Wherefore hauing no more hope

After which prize the <hi>Romans</hi> ioyn'd it to the <hi>Quadrireme,</hi> and kept
them continually armed and ready in the Port: By which meanes
they tooke from them all easie entrance into <hi>Lylibeum.</hi> In the meane
time they battered the Towne violently, and the Walles were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne
in diuers places with their Engines. But <hi>Imilcon</hi> built a new
Wall where as the old had been ouerthrowne, hauing no more hope in
his Sallies, nor be able to set fire on the Engines. And as they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

to the Gouernour, who finds this conceit good, and after that hee

and casts fire in three places vpon the Engines. The which when the
Souldiers had done suddainly, the fire by reason of the violence of the
Winde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ooke easily, and consumed them speedily, for that they were
dry, and had beene long burnt in the Sunne Neither was it possible
to preuent it by the hand of Man, for the violence of the Winde. In
trueth they were so amazed at this new accident, as they had not iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

their Engines, some fell, being ouerthrowne with great Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands
falling from aboue, or blinded with smoake. And the more
the <hi>Romanes</hi> found themselues crossed and troubled for the reasons
aboue mentioned, the more beneficiall and fortunate it was for the
<hi>Carthaginians:</hi> For they might easily discouer the Enemies and
all the Engines, and if they they cast any thing against the <hi>Romans</hi> or
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:16537:25"/>
their Engines, the Winde draue it with great violence, and made the
blow more forcible. Finally, the fire was so great, as the foundation
whereon the Towers were set, were burnt, and the Heads of the
Rammes consumed.</p>
            <p>The Consuls after this had no more care to repaire their Engines, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluing

they of <hi>Lylibeum</hi> had rampired all places necessary, they indured the
Siege with great courage. But after the <hi>Romans</hi> had receiued newes
of this Disaster, the Senate caused ten thousand men to bee raised,
which they sent into <hi>Sicily</hi> to refresh their Army, for that many had

was approued by the Captaines, hee made choice of some out of the
old and new Bands, and furnished all his ships with the ablest men in

was short, and the promises great. Being then ready, they parted

the hazard rather then to be besieged shamefully in the Port. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he presently caused their Oares to imbarke, and caused the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
to round, to draw the Souldiers together, shewing them in few
words, according to the necessity of the time, that if they did their
duties, there was hope of Victory: But if they refused to fight, he layed
them before the miseries of men besieged. And when as the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
made shew of resolution, crying o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t that hee should make no
stay to march against the Enemy, then <hi>Adherball</hi> commending their
forwardnesse, causeth them all to imbarke, giuing them charge to
haue an eye vnto his ship, and that they should follow with courage.
Presently after hee parts first our of the Port, as he had said, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
side to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Consull seeing the Enemies contrary to his hope, not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
the place, nor ready to flye, but seeking the Combat with
great heate, hee called backe his shippes, whereof some were
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:16537:26"/>
already in the Port, others at the entry, following them neere. And
when as the first turned head, according to the Consulls commaund,
and that the rest which followed farre off made hast to enter into the
Port, they fell foule one vpon another at the entry, and at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
foorth, so as the <hi>Romans</hi> were in danger to haue lost all. Finally
after the Vessells had recouered the open Sea, the Captaines Ranked
themselues along the shore one after another, turning their Prowe to
the enemy. But the Consull who from the beginning had alwayes
followed the Army, made the left Wing, casting himselfe into the
open Sea.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, <hi>Adherball</hi> hauing gotten aboue the left Wing of
the <hi>Romans</hi> with fiue Vessells, and turning the Prowe to the enemy, he
fortified himselfe by the Sea, commaunding other foure which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to do the like. When they were thus in Front against the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
he giues them a signe to charge the <hi>Romanes,</hi> whose ships (as we
haue sayd) were Rank'd along the shore. It is true they had done it, to
the end that the enemies Vessells which should part out of the Port,<note place="margin">A Combate at Sea betwixt the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
               </note>
might be incountred with more ease. The battell was long and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
so as the danger seemed equall; without doubt they were the
choyce men of both the Armies at Land. Yet the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had
alwayes the better, for that their Vessells were lighter, their men more
expert in Rowing, and moreouer they were in the open Sea, where
they might turne vp and downe at their pleasure. If any one were neere
prest by the Enemy, he knew how to sau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

turning presently together, compassed and hemb'd them in by their
lightnesse.</p>
            <p>By this meanes they spoiled them much, and sometimes sunke them.
And if any one of their companions were in danger, they relieued him
easily without perill, sailing in the open Sea. Contrariwise the shore
neere vnto the <hi>Romanes</hi> did annoy them much; for being forced in a
streight, they could not Retyre in necessity, nor defend themselues,
nor succour them that were prest, nor passe beyond the Enemies to
charge them againe. Which is a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Romans,</hi> resistance was greater then they expected, they sailed in the

at <hi>Sarragosse,</hi> he past the Cape of <hi>Pachinus</hi> to come vnto <hi>Lylibeum,</hi>
hauing no aduertisement of that which had hapned vnto his men some

            <p>The <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Captayne hauing newes by his Scouts of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulls

ships. But when as <hi>Lucius Iunius</hi> saw the enemies Army a far off,
he was amazed at the great number, so as he durst not fight; neyther
could he well flye being so neere vnto them. Wherefore Retyring by
dangerous and difficult places, hee stayed in the first Port, resoluing
rather to indure all extremities, then to suffer the <hi>Roman</hi> Army to fall
into the enemies hands. The which <hi>Carthalo</hi> Commaunder of the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> perceiuing, he made no more pursuite, but retyred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Port betwixt the two <hi>Roman</hi> Armies, hoping by this meanes to
keepe both Armies from parting. Some few dayes after there rose a
great storm; the which the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> perceiuing, as Men which had
great experience in Sea matters, and knowledge of the places where they
were,<note place="margin">The <hi>Romanes</hi> Fleete broken at Sea by the Violence of a storme.</note> informed <hi>Carthalo</hi> that in passing speedily beyond the Cape of
<hi>Pachinum,</hi> he should auoyde the violence of the storme: whereby they
preserued all his Fleet. But the <hi>Romans</hi> were so beaten with the storm,
for that the places where they were had no Ports, that their ships were
broken in such sort, that there remayned not any thing, whereof they
could afterwards make vse. By the meanes of these mis-fortunes at
Sea, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were afterwards the stronger.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romanes</hi> hauing lately made so great a losse at <hi>Tripanum,</hi> and

And therefore the Lords of the Senate, and they which were at the
siege at <hi>Lylibeum,</hi> were of aduice to continue the siege, although they
had bin affllicted with the former mis-fortunes. By this meanes the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi>

            <p>The Consull set a Garrison vpon the top of the Mountayne, and at

that he should be able to keep the Towne and all the Mountayne safely.
After the taking of <hi>Erix,</hi> the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> made <hi>Amilcar,</hi> surnamed

returned into the Territory of <hi>Palermo</hi> with his whole Army, where
he planted himselfe in a Place betwixt <hi>Rhegium</hi> and <hi>Palermo,</hi> the
which lay high aboue the Sea, and was fortified by nature, and safe
for his Campe.</p>
            <p>It is a Mountayne inuironed with caues and holes, vpon the which
there is a playne not lesse then twelue miles in compasse, the which is
commodious and fit for labour. It hath moreouer all the Sea Winds,
and is not infected with any venomous Beast. Moreouer it is inuironed
both by Sea and Land with inaccessible Rockes, in regard of the places
which are betwixt both there is no great need of buildings. It hath on
the top a little Hill which serues for a Watch and Fortresse; it hath like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
a very pleasant and commodious Port, for such as passe from <hi>Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panum</hi>
or <hi>Lylibcum</hi> into <hi>Italy;</hi> and it hath store of Water. There are
but three wayes to go vnto this Mount, which are difficult and vneasy,
two vpon the firme Land, and the third towards the Sea. <hi>Amilcar</hi>
Planted his Campe there, where there was no conuenient Towne,<note place="margin">Amilcar.</note> but
was lodged among his enemies, whom he did not suffer to liue in rest:
For many times he went to Sea, and spoyl'd the coast of <hi>Italy</hi> vnto
<hi>Cumes,</hi> and then he led his Army by Land vnto <hi>Palermo.</hi> and besieged
it within eight hundred Furlongs of the <hi>Romanes</hi> Campe: where he stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
neere three yeares, performing many braue Acts which were diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to relate in particular. For euen as when excellent Combattants
re-doubling their blowes with dexterity and force, the prize of the
Victory being propounded, it is neyther possible for them, nor for the
standers by, to yeild a reason of euery charge and blow, taking in
generall a sufficient knowledge of their Valour, aswell by the Prowesse
of the Men, as by their mutuall indeauours, and by their Experience
and Virtue; we must conceiue the like of the Commaunders of whom
we now speake.</p>
            <p>For if any one will Write the causes, or manner how they lay Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bushes,
and intertayne skirmishes and incounters, he should not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to number them, and would cause a great trouble without any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to the Reader; where we may better attayne to the knowledge of
things past, by a generall narration and by the end of the War. They
likewise cannot perceiue in this present War, any thing by the History
of the great pollicies, nor by the time, nor by the feeling of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
case by things done, which haue bin decided with an ouer-weaning
and violent boldnesse. There are many causes, for the which they
could not discerne betwixt the two Campes; for the Armies were equal
and their Forts not easie to be approached vnto, for that the space be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
both was very strong and little; so as there daily hapned particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
combates. Finally they performed nothing which concerned the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:16537:28"/>
end of the Warre: For many times in incounters some were slayne, and
others turning away, and escaping the danger assured themselues, and
fought againe, where Fortune remayning like a good Distributer, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
them from Front to Front, hath inclosed them in a narrower com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe,
and a more dangerous fight in regard of the place and precedent
Combat.</p>
            <p>Whilst the <hi>Romans</hi> (as we haue sayd) kept the top and foote of the
Mountayne of <hi>Erix, Amilcar</hi> surprized the Towne, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the top of the Hill,<note place="margin">The Towne of <hi>Erix</hi> taken from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcar.</hi>
               </note> and the foote of it, where the <hi>Roman</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
lay. By this meanes the <hi>Romans</hi> which held the top, were besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> with great danger: The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
were no lesse in the Towne, seeing they were besieged from the
top of the Mountayne, and from the foote, and hauing but one way,
they could hardly draw vnto them that which was necessary. Thus ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Party persisted one against another with extreame obstinacy: Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring
great extremities and running into great dangers. Finally, they
purchased a sacred Crowne, not as <hi>Fabius</hi> sayth, as Men weakned and
tyred, but constant and not vanquished: For before that one party o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercame
the other, although the War continued two yeares, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
to haue an end by another meanes. Finally the Affaires of <hi>Erix,</hi>
and the forces were in this estate.</p>
            <p>You may imagine that these two Common-Weales,<note place="margin">A good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison.</note> did like vnto
Rauening Birds fighting among themselues vnto the last gaspe: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that sometimes their flight fayled them for want of breath, yet
they repulse the assaults with great courage, vntill that hiding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
willingly, they fled away easily; this done some take their flight
before the rest. In like manner the <hi>Romanes</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with toyle, grew cold in their continuall combats, abating their
forces for the ordinary charges. And although the <hi>Romanes</hi> had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
the combats at Sea, almost for fifteene yeares, aswell for their
mis-fortunes, as for that they did hope to make an end of this Warre
by the Army at Land; yet seeing their designe not successefull, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
likewise the courage of <hi>Amilcar,</hi> they conceiued a third hope in
their Forces at Sea. They aduised well, that if their designe were
successefull, it would be a meanes to make an end of their Affaires, the
which in the end they effected.</p>
            <p>First, they left the Sea yeilding vnto their mis-fortunes: And for
the second time, for that they had bin vanquished neere vnto <hi>Trypa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
and finally at the third time, they were of another humour, by
the which being Victors, they cut off the Victuals from <hi>Erix,</hi> and
made an end of the Warre. This attempt for the most part was like a
Combate of great courage; for the publicke Treasure vnable to furnish
this charge: But the Citizens contributing euery Man vnto his power,
many together built a Quinquereme, supplying the necessary expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
so much the peoples hearts were i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>flamed to Armes, and to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire. By this meanes they made a preparation of
two hundred Quinqueremes, after the patterne of the <hi>Rhodien,</hi> the
which as we haue sayd had beene taken before <hi>Lylibeum:</hi> Wherefore
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16537:28"/>

            </p>
            <p>In the meane time all the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ships retired to their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.
Afterwards hee indeauoured to take <hi>Trepanum</hi> with his Engins,
and other things necessary to force a Towne: But for that the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
Army at Sea was not farre off, they had a remembrance of things
past, and of what importance the knowledge of the Sea was, he was not
idle nor negligent, causing his Rowers and Marriners to bee continually
kept in practice, not suffring any one to be idle. By this meanes the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
in a short time were inured to the Sea. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> contrary
to their hope, hauing newes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army at Sea, presently prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their ships,<note place="margin">An Army at Sea prepared by the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians.</hi>
               </note> and rraighted them with Corne &amp; other Munition, to the
end the besieged within the Towne of <hi>Erix</hi> should not haue any want of
things necessary. <hi>Hanno</hi> had the charge of this Army, who past first to

               <note place="margin">Hanno.</note> and from thence he made haste to sayle aboue
the Enemy to <hi>Amilcars</hi> Campe, to discharge his ships, and to victuall it.
But <hi>Luctatius</hi> being aduertised of their comming, and doubting of their
enterprize, (for it was not hard to coniecture) made choice of the ablest
men of the Army at Land, and failed directly to the Island of <hi>Eguse,</hi>
which is not farre from <hi>Lylibeum.</hi> Then hauing giuen courage to the
Souldiers, he makes a Proclamation that euery man should be ready the
next day to fight.</p>
            <p>Three daies after the Consull seeing at the breake of day that the wind
was good and prosperous for the Enemy, and contrary to his Army; and
that the Sea was much troubled with a storme, he was long in suspence
what he should doe: but suddainly he resolued, that if his men came to
fight during the storme, he should haue nothing to doe but with <hi>Hanno</hi>
and his Army at Sea, and with ships that were laden and incumbred:
But if he should delay the fight vntill the Sea were calme, he should
haue to deale with ships that were light and very swift, and with the
choice of the Land souldiers: and moreouer with the courage of <hi>Amil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car,</hi>
who was then held to be very terrible. Finally, he resolued to fight
with the Enemy notwithstanding the storme and the contrary Winde.
The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> comming with full sayle,<note place="margin">A fight at Sea betwixt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians.</hi>
               </note> he put himselfe before
them with his Army ready and in battell. When the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
saw their course to bee hindered by the Enemy, and their ships in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
they strooke saile, and prepared to fight, where they charged
of either side with great courage: But for that things were manna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in another manner, than when they were defeated at the battell
of <hi>Trepanum,</hi> it was no wonder if that their Affaires had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
successe.</p>
            <p>In regard of the <hi>Romans,</hi> their ships were very light, and free from
all incombrance, but of that which was necessary for the Warre.
Their Rowers had beene long practised, and were therefore eager and
ready to fight. They had also made choice of the best men in their
Army at Land: the which fell out contrary with the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:16537:29"/>
Their ships were laden, and therefore vnfit to fight: Their Rowers
and Marriners were men gathered together by chance, and not accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

thing: for they had no more care for the affaires at Sea, imagining that the
<hi>Romans</hi> would not attempt any thing more at Sea. And therefore

and ten others that were laden, taken. The rest set sayle and got the
Winde, and recouered <hi>Hieronese</hi> with incredible swiftnesse, by a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
change of the Winde. After the Battell the Consull retired to
<hi>Lylibeum</hi> with his whole Army, whereas the booty and Prisoners
were deuided amongst the Souldiers: For besides the dead, there were
aboue ten thousand men taken.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> amazed at this heauy and great defeate, found
themselues troubled for many reasons, although their minds were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
inclin'd to Warres. First they had no meanes to victuall those
that were in <hi>Sicily,</hi> after the defeate of their Army at Sea: Considering
that their Enemies were Maisters of all the Sea. Moreouer they imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that it would be a Traiterous act to suffer their Generall and the
Souldiers which had serued their Common-wealth to be lost. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of continuing the War, they had neither Men nor Captaines to
mannage it: wherefore they sent a Man to <hi>Amilcar,</hi> and gaue him full
power and Authority to doe what he should thinke fitting for the good
of the Common-weale. <hi>Amilcar</hi> performed the duty of a good and
wise Captaine: For whilest there was any hope in the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
he neuer complained of his paines, nor auoided perill, but being a
man of great industry and courage, he thrust himselfe continually into all
dangers, to vanquish aswell as any of the other Captaines. But when as
he saw there was no more hope in the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> affaires, hee sent
Embassadours to the Consull, to treate vpon an accord, yeelding wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and discreetly vnto the time: For wee must know that the duty of a
good Captaine consists aswell in considering of the time, not onely to
vanquish, but also to strike sayle. Whereunto <hi>Luctatius</hi> did willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
giue care, knowing well the necessities which the people of <hi>Rome</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
by this tedious War, Finally, a peace was thus concluded:
that the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians</hi> should line in amity and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
if the people of <hi>Rome</hi> would consent vnto it: And that the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi>
should leaue all <hi>Sicily:</hi> Neither should they hereafter make
War against <hi>Hieron,</hi> nor against the <hi>Saragossins,</hi> or their Allies, and
that they should restore all the Prisoners without ransome: And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
they should pay thirteene hundred and twenty thousand Crownes
within twenty yeares.</p>
            <p>These Articles were sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> which the people notwithstanding
would not yeeld vnto: but committed ten men with power from them
who were sent into <hi>Sicily:</hi> Being arriued, they altered nothing of the
treaty of peace, but the time of payment, which they shortned, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
the summe with 600000. Crownes more. Moreouer they
did articulate, that they should not onely dislodge out of <hi>Sicily,</hi> but
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:16537:29"/>
also out of all the Islands which are betwixt it and <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Behold the end of the first Warre betwixt the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
for <hi>Sicily.</hi> It continued foure and twenty whole yeares, and
hath beene the longest and the greatest that was euer heard spoken of.
During the which (I omit other things worthy of memory) they haue
fought at one instant with aboue fiue hundred Quinqueremes on both
sides: Afterwards with not much lesse then seauen hundred. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
haue lost seauen hundred <hi>Quinqueremes,</hi> besides those which
at sundry times the torments haue sunke, and the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> about
fiue hundred. Wherefore they which formerly haue admired Armies
aswell by Land as Sea, and the Combats at Sea of <hi>Antigonus, Ptolomey,</hi>
and <hi>Demetrius,</hi> haue reason to cease, considering the great deeds of
the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> But if they will consider how great a
difference there is betwixt the Quinqueremes and Triremes, whereof
the <hi>Persians</hi> made vse against the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and which the <hi>Athenians</hi> and
<hi>Lacedemonians</hi> vsed in their Warre, they shall vndoubtedly see, that
there was neuer seene such great forces fight at Sea, wherefore that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
plainely which we haue propounded in the beginning, that the
<hi>Romans</hi> haue not onely indeauoured to conquer the vniuersall Empire by
vallour, but they haue also accomplished their desire, not by good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
as some <hi>Grecians</hi> suppose, nor by chance, but by a wonderfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
and practice in such great affaires.</p>
            <p>Although that some may demaund how it happeneth that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
who are at this day farre greater Lords both at Land and Sea,
considering that they held in a manner the Empire of the whole world,
cannot draw together so many Vessels, nor rayse so great an Army at
Sea at one instant. The reason will be easie, when they shall let them
vnderstand what the Romane Common-wealth was, what their Lawes
and their manner of liuing, although it will not be profitable neither
for vs nor for the Readers of our Workes, to make mention of things
which concerne not our purpose. Without doubt the Reasons are
great: the which notwithstanding in my Opinion no man hath knowne
vnto this day by the errour of Historiographers: Whereof some knew
not what they wrote, and if others vnderstood them, they haue made
them obscure and vnprofitable. If they would duely consider this
War, they shall finde that the courage and power of these two great
Citties were equall. First their desire was alike, they had the same cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and the like desire of glory. It is true, the <hi>Romans</hi> had the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Souldiers: But <hi>Amilcar</hi> Generall of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> surnamed
<hi>Barca,</hi> Father to <hi>Haniball,</hi> who afterwards made Warre against the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Amilcar</hi> Father to <hi>Hanniball.</hi>
               </note>
had not his equall in prudence and vallour. When as the peace
had beene concluded, either of them fell in a manner into the like incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences:
for Ciuill war followed after. The <hi>Romans</hi> had presently
War against the Inhabitants of Mount-<hi>Flacon:</hi> the which was soone de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
and their Towne taken.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> being assailed at the same time by Strangers,

in a manner quite ruined. Finally, they were forced to fight not onely
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:16537:30"/>
for the Prouince, but for themselues, for their liberty, for their Children,
and for their owne Country.</p>
            <p>This is a warre which we will relate summarily and briefly, for it is
worthy, as we haue promised in the beginning. So they shall easily see
by the deeds of these times what this warre was, and of what fury,

easily see by the knowledge of this warre, the causes for the which <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball</hi>
made warre against the <hi>Romans,</hi> which is a principall poynt,
whereof in opening the truth, wee haue not done little for those which
desire to see our worke. For that they haue not onely beene doubtfull
and obscure to those which haue written, but also to such as haue beene
present. After that <hi>Amilcar</hi> had treated the peace with the <hi>Romans,</hi> he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed his Army from the Towne of <hi>Erix</hi> to <hi>Lylibeum,</hi> and resigned his
charge, giuing the conduct thereof into <hi>Affricke</hi> to Captaine <hi>Gescon,</hi> who
was at <hi>Lylibeum:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gescon.</note> who fearing that if so great a multitude of men, should
passe together into <hi>Affricke,</hi> there would grow some mutiniy
and contenttion for that there was much due vnto them for their
pay, the which they could not satisfie for want of treasure: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he prouided long before, that the troupes should not passe altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but at diuers times, leauing some respite of purpose: to the end
that they might with more ease prouide, in sending them backe by

former charges, and did not send them backe to their houses but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to attend within the City vntill the returne of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
to the end they might make some accord with them altogether
concerning their Paye.<note place="margin">Insolency of the Souldiers within <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> But when as the Souldiers committed many
Royots day and night within the City, and that the insolencies of such
a troupe were insupportable, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> called the Captaines, and
iurreated them to leade all this multi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ude assembled in their City to
the Towne of <hi>Sicca,</hi> vntill they had giuen order for their Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Moreouer they caused some money to be deliuered to euery one of
them, to the end they might tolerate their expectance the more easily.
The Captaines obeying the will of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> drew forth their
Men.</p>
            <p>But for that euery man desired to leaue his baggage within the City,
as they had done, hoping to make a short returne for their paye: the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> doubted that if they should allow that, some would not
budge for the loue of their children, others for their wiues, and by this
meanes they should bee nothing bettered within the City. Wherefore
in the end they forced them to depart with their baggage. Being within
the Towne of <hi>Sicca,</hi> they liued at pleasure in idlenes and basely, which is
a pernicious thing for an Army, and in a manner the onely fountaine and
beginning of Mutinie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Some began to demaund their pay more auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:16537:30"/>
then they had beene accustomed, and much more, reducing to
memory the promise of Presents, which the Captaines had made vnto
them at need, when as they intreated them to fight valiantly. More o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
they expected much more then their Pay amounted vnto: But
they were frustrated of their hope: For assoone as they were all assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in <hi>Sicca, Hanno, Pretor</hi> of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> was sent vnto them:
Who bringing no presents vnto them, intreated them moreouer for
some abatement of their Pay, shewing them the pouerty of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
They generally mutining at this speech, began to rise suddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Mutiny of the Souldiers.</note>
so as there was a great tumult and sedition in the Army, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the great diuersity of their manner of liuing, and languages. It is
true the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had some reason to raise their Army out of diuers
Nations: For by this meanes so diuers an assembly could not easily
make a Conspiracy. Moreouer the Captaines better obeyed. And
likewise if there did rise any mutiny or sedition in the Army, they should
not finde meanes to pacifie them, for ignorant men are mooued with
fury. Beleeue me when they are once in choller, they increase it more
and more, like bruite Beasts with an vnrestraine cruelty. The which
happened at that time in the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> Campe: For some were
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> others <hi>Ganles,</hi> some <hi>Geneuois,</hi> and others of the Islands of
<hi>Maiorqua,</hi> and <hi>Minorqua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was also a good Troope of <hi>Grecians,</hi> most of which were fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitiues
and slaues, and the greatest number were <hi>Affricans.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was not possible to draw them altogether at that time, although
they could not haue taken a better course. Moreouer <hi>Hanno</hi> could not
vnderstand all their languages: and it seemed in a manner more impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to imploy many Interpreters at one time to draw the Army toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and withall to vse the same speech vnto them foure or fiue times.
The last remedy was to mannage this by the Captaines; the which
<hi>Hanno</hi> attempting preuailed nothing: For some vnderstood not what
their Captaine sayd vnto them, others related it otherwise then they
had spoken, although they had consented vnto the cliefe, some did it
of ignorance, but the greatest part through malice. Wherefore all was
full of perplexity, inhumanity and distrust.</p>
            <p>Among other things they complained,<note place="margin">The complaint of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> of
purpose did not send one of the Captaines vnder whose charge they had
made War in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and who had made them so many promises; but
one who had beene in those actions. Finally, they runne to Armes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all in a mutiny, making no accompt of <hi>Hanno,</hi> nor of the other Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
and marcht directly to <hi>Carthage,</hi> planting their Campe neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Towne of <hi>Tunes,</hi> which is fifteene miles from <hi>Carthage,</hi> being
aboue twenty thousand Men. Then the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> began to looke
one vpon another, and to acknowledge their great errour, when there
was no redresse in their affaires. In trueth it was a great fault in them to
haue drawne together so great a multitude into one place after the War
was ended. They committed another which was no lesse, when as
they did not retaine their Wiues Children and baggage, whereof they
might haue made vse in necessity as of Hostages. Being in no small feare
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:16537:31"/>
of so great a multitude of Men, they omitted nothing which they
thought be hoouefull to pacifie their Rage, causing Corne to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vnto them, and all other things necessary, and to be deliuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them at their owne prize.</p>
            <p>Moreouer the Senate sent Embassies often vnto them, promising to
do according to their commaund, so as it were in their power: But the
Souldiers who are now growne more insolent, did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orge daily new
Quarrels, perceiuing the feare of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> especially for
that they had bin trayn'd vp in the War of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and that the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
nor any other durst looke vpon them in order of battel Wherfore
whereas formerly they had made their quarrell, but for the pay that
was due, they now demaunded Recompence for their Horses that
were slayne, and not content with that, they pretended there was
Corne due vnto them for many yeares, for the which they demanded
payment at a prise, whereof vntill that day they had neuer heard them
speake. Finally they daily pretended new quarrels to enter into War,
for the most Wicked and Mutinous had the greatest credite in the
Army.</p>
            <p>And when as the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had made promise vnto them, to
do all things possible, in the end they agreed, that for any thing that
should be doubtfull, they should Refer themselues to that which the
Generall should decree, vnder whom they had made War in <hi>Sicily.</hi>
They did not much affect <hi>Amilcar Barca,</hi> vnder whose charge they
had bin, for that he came not to see them during this dissention, and
that he had formerly Relinquisht his commaund ouer them of his owne
motion: Contrariwise they all in generall loued <hi>Gescon,</hi> who had bin
their Captaine in <hi>Sicily,</hi>

in all other things, as in their passage to <hi>Affricke;</hi> wherefore he had
the charge by a common consent. Presently being imbarked with
Mony, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iuing at <hi>Tunes,</hi> he called the Captaines: then he caused
euery nation to Assemble, and blamed them for their faults past,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gescon</hi> makes remonstrances to the Souldiers</note> and
admonishing them for the present, and giuing them aduice by a long
speech for the time to come, to continue good friends to the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
who had intertayned them so long. Finally he perswades them
to Rest satisfied with their pay, the which he desired to diuide among
the Nations.</p>
            <p>There was by chance a <hi>Campanois</hi> in the Army called <hi>Spendius,</hi> who
being lately a slaue vnto the <hi>Romanes,</hi> had fled into <hi>Sicily:</hi> This was a
bold and hardy Man, and a good Souldier:<note place="margin">Spendius.</note> Who (fearing that if they
agreed with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> he should be Restored to his Maister,
and then put to Death according to the <hi>Roman</hi> Lawes) vsed Audacious
speeches, and laboured by all meanes to mutine them all, desiring
troubles rather then any accord, and Wars then Peace. Moreouer an
<hi>Affricaine</hi> called <hi>Matho,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Malbo.</note> a free Man who had beene in the Wars of
<hi>Sicily,</hi> for the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> feared to be punished, for that he had
much incensed the Munity, during the Dissention. This <hi>Matho</hi> ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with <hi>Spendius,</hi> drawes together all the <hi>Affricaines,</hi> and Aduises
them to consider well what they had to doe in this Action, and that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:16537:31"/>
they should rest assured, that presently after the Retreate of the other
Souldiers, hauing receiued their pay, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged
wholly vpon them, (labouring by this meanes to terrifie all the
<hi>Affricanes</hi> with punishment) and for this reason they should looke well
to themselues.</p>
            <p>The whole Troupe being much mooued with this speech, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
for that <hi>Gescon</hi> had onely spoken of their bare pay, without any
mention of Recompence for Horses dead, nor of Corne for so many
yeeres, they drew presently all together to consult of their Affaires.
And when as <hi>Spendius</hi> and <hi>Matho</hi> vsed very bad speeches against
<hi>Gescon</hi> and the <hi>Carthagintans,</hi> they easily gaue eare vnto them. And
if any one sought to shew the contrary, they had not the Patience to
heare them, if it were contrary to the opinion of <hi>Spendius,</hi> but beat
them downe presently with stones. By this meanes the Murther was
great, not onely of Captaynes but of simple Souldiers, so as there
was nothing heard in the Army during this Mutiny, but all cryed out
together, Charge, charge. And although they did this continually, yet
their fury was greater, when they parted drunke from the Table. By
this meanes as soone as any one cryed Charge, the stones flew about, so
as there was no meanes of Retreate. Wherefore when no Man durst
speake any thing in the Assembly, they made choise by a generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of <hi>Matho</hi> and <hi>Spendius</hi> for their Captaines. And although that
<hi>Gescon</hi> saw this great trouble and mutiny in the Campe, yet he desired
to prefer the Publicke Vtility before all other things. Wherefore see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that by the mutiny of the Souldiers increasing daily more and more,
the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were in great danger, he resolued to pacifie it, and
to trye all meanes with the hazard of his life.</p>
            <p>One day he called the Heads of the Conspiracy, another day some
Nation apart, labouring to pacifie their fury by prayers and promises.
But for asmuch as they had not yet receiued the Corne, which they
sayd was due vnto them, and that they quarrelled continually, <hi>Gescon</hi>
desorous to restraine their contempt, commaunded them to set downe
their demaunds to their Captaine <hi>Matho.</hi> At which words the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
incensed grew so insolent, as they presently seized vppon all the
Siluer which was brought thither for their pay, laying hold vpon <hi>Gescon</hi>
and the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> that were with him. But <hi>Matho</hi> and <hi>Spendius</hi>
Captaynes of the whole Troupe, thought presently to commit some
Act of great Villany, to the end that the War might be the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed.
And therefore in commending the insolency of the Souldiers,
they tooke with the Money all the baggage of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and
gaue order to shut vp <hi>Gescon</hi> with all his company, after they had done
them many outrages.</p>
            <p>After this, they made open War against the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> with
the most cruell Conspiracy, that euer had beene heard speake of vnto
that day. Behold the causes of the beginning of this War, made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

that the Captaines had diuided their Army in two, one part went to
besiege <hi>Bisarthe,</hi> and the other <hi>Hippona,</hi> for that they would not
consent vnto the Conspiracy. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> who had beene accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
to feed their families only by Tillage, and to draw their publicke
Treasure from the Tributes of <hi>Affricke,</hi> and moreouer to mannage
their War by Mercenaries; being then not onely frustrated of all these
things, but moreouer seeing they were all turned to their Ruine, found
themselues suddainly in great difficulties, not knowing which way to
turne them. And they found them the more desperate, for that they
had hapned contrary to all opinion.</p>
            <p>It is true, they were in hope, after they had beene tyred with the
long Wars of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and had in the end made a peace with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
that they might rest for a time, and take breath; but it succeeded
otherwise. Beleeue me, this War suddainly kindled, was more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
than the other: For that in the first, they did not fight with the
<hi>Romans</hi> but for the Conquest of <hi>Sicily;</hi> but in this they were forced, to
vndergoe the danger for themselues, for their families and their
Country. Moreouer they were vnfurnished of Armes, of a Fleete
at Sea, and of Equipage for shipping, for that they had lost many
in their battels at Sea. They had no more hope of Tributes, nor in
the succours of their friends and Allies. Finally they saw then what
difference there was betwixt a Forraine and Transmarine War, and the
muti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> of which mischiefe vndoubtedly they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
were the cause: For in their first War, they did Lord it ouer the

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etousnesse, for
that they were of opinion they had good cause, so as they leuied a full
moiety of all their fruites. They also doubled the Tributes, and did
not pardon those which had offended through ignorance. They gaue
Offices not to such as were milde and gracious, but to those which aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
the publicke Treasure, although they had tyrannized the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
like vnto <hi>Hanno</hi> of whom we haue spoken.</p>
            <p>By this meanes it hapned that the people of <hi>Affricke</hi> seemed glad to

Tribute: so as they made no reseruation of their goods which they had
remayning, but moreouer they did contribute their Iewels, (a hard
thing to belieue) to supply the payment of the Souldiers. By this
meanes <hi>Matho</hi> and <hi>Spendius</hi> gathered together so great a quantity of
siluer, as it was not onely sufficient to satisfie the promises which they
had made to the Souldiers, from the beginning of the Conspiracy, but
they had more than was needfull to mannage the War. Wherefore a
wise man must not looke vnto the present time, but also vnto the
future.</p>

and trying all meanes to passe into <hi>Affricke,</hi> in the end hee
vsed this inuention. Hee had obserued that sometimes the course of
this Riuer was so stopt by the Winde, as the mouth of it ouerflowed,
and made in a manner a great poole, and at that time it had no great
fall into the Sea. Wherefore hee was of opinion, that at this season
they might passe it neere vnto the Sea. Hee kept this secret, and
onely made necessary preparation for the Army to march. Hee care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
attended the opportunity of the time, and then appointed
his Army to part secretly in the Night, and to passe the Riuer.</p>
            <p>But at the breake of day the Enemy and they that were in the

When as <hi>Spendius</hi> had the news that <hi>Amilcars</hi> Campe had past,
he presently makes haste with his forces to succour his men. Behold how
the two Campes succoured one another. There were 10000. men in

the other side thou seekest to resist him, there is nothing so vnreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
so cruell, nor so wicked, but he will easily vndertake it, glorifying
himselfe in his presumption, vntill his proud Spirit hath past the bounds
of Reason. Of which things the beginning and the greatest part, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes
from the lewd life, and bad breeding of Youth. There are
other things which adde much vnto it, and namely the Couetousnes and
cruelty of the Captaynes. All which Vices were found at that time
in this Army, and especially in the Commaunders.</p>
            <p>In the meane time <hi>Amilcar</hi> bearing the enemies outrages impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
caused <hi>Hanno,</hi> another Captayne Generall for the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>

to entertayne the friendship of the <hi>Romanes;</hi> to the end that after the

            <p>This was wisely considered of him: For in truth no Man must seeme
carelesse of such things, neyther must they suffer any one to grow to
so great a power, as he shall haue cause euer after to feare a manifest
iniustice. The <hi>Romans</hi> also bound by the Articles of the peace, did
what they could possibly to relieue them. It is true, that in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

            <p>

<hi>Amilcar</hi> had reduced them to such great want of all things, as they were
in the end forced to raise the siege. Soone after they made choyse of
the ablest Men of all their bands, to the number of fifty Thousand, and
went presently to seeke out <hi>Amilcar.</hi> Moreouer they kept not the plaines,

the which, although they were as strong and hardy as the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi>
yet they were often beaten, for that they vnderstood not
the practise of Warre. Then they might easily iudge what difference
there is betwixt the good conduct of a Captaine, and the ouer-weaning
of a Multitude. He separated some and inclosed others by his industry,
being forced by their priuate necessity. He also defeated many by Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bushes

them for the cruelties they had committed against their Friends. They
came not to fight, both for that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were assured of the
Victory, and their punishment was certayne. They made no mention
of any treaty of peace, for that they knew well there was no hope of
Mercy, hauing committed such great cruelties. Finally they indured
all miseries, expecting daily succours from <hi>Tunes.</hi> But when they had
cruelly eaten vp their Prisoners,<note place="margin">Famine makes them to eate men.</note> and their Seruants, (a kind of liuing
which they had long vsed) and that no succours came from <hi>Tunes,</hi> they
knew not what to resolue, for the extremity of the Famine, and the

with whom <hi>Amilcar</hi> agrees, that it should be lawfull for the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians,</hi>
to chuse ten such as they pleased out of their whole Army,
and that the rest might retire in their shirts without any harme. The
which when they had concluded, <hi>Amilcar</hi> told them, that according
to the agreement he made choise of those that were in his presence. By
this meanes <hi>Spendius, Autarice,</hi> and the other heads of the Army were

that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had broken their Faith, for that they knew

               </note> This was neere vnto a place which
they call <hi>Serra,</hi> for that it doth resemble an instrument, which at this
day is called <hi>Sie.</hi> This done, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> who before seemed
to haue lost all hope, began to assure themselues, and to recouer their
courage and Spirits. In the meane time <hi>Amilcar</hi> with <hi>Hannibal</hi> and
<hi>Naraue</hi> ouer-ran the Country, and the Townes of the Prouince, where
hauing reduced the greatest part of <hi>Affricke</hi> with the Townes, they
go and lay siege to <hi>Tunes,</hi> and besiege <hi>Matho</hi> with all his Company.
<hi>Hannibal</hi> lay on that side which look<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

spoyl'd the Campe and all the Baggage. <hi>Hannibal</hi> himselfe was taken,

of <hi>Carthage,</hi> about the body of <hi>Spendius</hi> most cruelly, by a power
giuen them by Fortune for a mutuall reuenge. <hi>Amilcar</hi> was not soone
enough aduertised of the enemies sally, by reason of the distance of
the two Campes, neyther was it in his owne power to relieue them, in
regard of the difficulty of the places. Wherefore leauing <hi>Tunes,</hi> and
leading his Army to the Riuer of <hi>Machera,</hi> he lodged vpon the bankes
at the mouth of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> hauing newes of this defeate, began againe to
haue a bad conceite of their Warre: But they presently resumed cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
vsing all possible diligence for the preseruation of the Citty.
They sent an Embassie to <hi>Amilcar</hi> of thirty Senators, with a leuy of
young men vnder the Commaund of that <hi>Hanno,</hi> who formerly had
beene the Generall. They giue these Senators charge, to deale so
with the two Captaines, as their priuate hatred might be smothered
and supprest, and that they should force them to manage this Warre
by their common Counsell, in laying before them the miseries of the
time and the present necessity. After that the Senators had drawne
these two Captaines together, and vsed diuers speeches vnto them, in the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16537:37"/>
end they perswade them to pardon one another,<note place="margin">Reconciliation of <hi>Amilcar</hi> and <hi>Hanno.</hi>
               </note> and to obey the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians.</hi>
By this meanes all the Affaires were gouerned by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Councell, so as when as <hi>Matho</hi> was reduced to a streight, after
many incounters, Ambushes, and pursuits which they had layd for him
neere to the Towne of <hi>Leptis,</hi> and in other places, in the end they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
a set day of battell with the enemy:<note place="margin">Assignation of a Battell.</note> to the which both Armies
prepared with Resolution. So they called their Allies, and drew men
from all parts, euen vnfurnishing their Townes of Garrisons, as if by
this battell they should decide all their affaires. When as all things
necessary for the fight were ready on eyther side, they ioyned vpon the
day appointed. The battell was cruell, but in the end the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
had the Victory. The greatest part of the enemies were slaine in
fighting:<note place="margin">A Battell won by the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians,</hi>
               </note> The rest which retired to the next Towne, yeilded soone after
to the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> In regard of <hi>Matho</hi> he was taken aliue. They on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of <hi>Bisarthe</hi> and <hi>Hippona</hi> finding themselues guilty, and hauing no
hope of pardon and Mercy, continued obstinate in their Rebellion. See
how a reasonable contentment hath power in all things, and how much
better it is, not to affect and seeke a thing, which afterwards is intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
to another.</p>
            <p>Finally after that <hi>Amilcar</hi> and <hi>Hanno</hi> began to approach neere vnto
them, they had no more hope, but were forced to yeild vpon such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
as pleased the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> Thus ended the Warre of <hi>Affrick,</hi>
but so happily for the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> as they not only recouered <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke,</hi>
but punished all the Heads of the Rebellion according to their
merites. Thus <hi>Matho</hi> and all the other Prisoners, were led in Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
through the Citty by the Youth of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matho</hi> punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> and in the end pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
for their Villanies. This Warre continued neere three yeares
and foure moneths, the most cruell and inhumane that euer was heard
spoken of.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romanes</hi> at that time solicited by the Souldiers which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired

And when as the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were discontented, saying that the
Island belonged vnto them, and prepared an Army to send thither,
the <hi>Romanes</hi> laying hold of this occasion, signified Warre vnto them,
complayning that this preparation of an Army was not so much for
<hi>Sardinia</hi> as against them. But the <hi>Canthaginians</hi> yeilding to the time,
vnderstanding well their owne weaknesse, to renew a Warre against
the <hi>Romanes,</hi> indeauoured to auoide all occasions, so as they left the
Island vnto them. And moreouer they paied vnto the <hi>Romanes</hi> seauen

and increase of the <hi>Romane</hi> power, must diligently obserue it.
This Voyage by Sea, was vndertaken for the causes which here
follow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agron</hi> King of <hi>Sclauonia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Agron</hi> King of <hi>Sclauonia.</hi>
               </note> was the Sonne of <hi>Plurate.</hi> This King
drew to field more foote and Horse, than any that had reigned before
him in <hi>Sclauonia.</hi> It is true, that he was corrupted with money at the
perswasion of <hi>Demetrius</hi> Father to <hi>Philip,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Demetrius</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Philip.</hi>
               </note> so as he succour'd the
<hi>Midioniens,</hi> whom the <hi>Etoliens</hi> held besieged. You must vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that when the <hi>Etoliens</hi> saw that they could not draw the <hi>Midi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oniens</hi>
to liue according to their Lawes, they began to make Warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, laying siege to diuers places, and doing what they possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
could to take the Citty. And as in the meane time the day of the
assembly was come, wherein they were to chuse another Captaine of
the Army, and that the besieged were growne so weake, as they see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to haue no other thoughts but of yeilding; he which at that time
was Generall, came vnto the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> and let them vnderstand that
it was reasonable, that he who had indured so great paines, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
himselfe to so many dangers during the Warre, should haue the
booty and spoile of the enemies if they were vanquished. There were
many, euen of those which had any colour to attaine vnto that charge,
who discontented with this kind of demaund, intreated the multitude
not to determine any thing, but to leaue the booty to him to whom
Fortune should giue it. Finally the <hi>Etoliens</hi> decreed that whosoeuer
should winne the Towne, he should share a moiety of all the Booty,
Riches, and Armes, with him who formerly had beene the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunder.</p>
            <p>While matters stood on these termes, and that within three dayes
after the Assembly was to meete (where according to the Custome of
the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> the last Commaunder was to be Deposed, and a new
choses) there arriued in the night about a hundred ships neere to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dionia,</hi>

               </note>
with ten thousand men of <hi>Sclauonia:</hi> Who after they had
recouered the Port, and the day began to breake, they landed in haste
and by stealth, and then they marched in battell after their manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Etoliens</hi> Army. And although the <hi>Etoliens</hi> being aduertised
of their comming, were at the first amazed at this newes, and the
boldnesse of the <hi>Sclauonians:</hi> Yet hauing great spirits and courage, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
also in their Forces, they drew out before their Campe, the
greatest part of their Horse and Armed men, and placed vpon some
passages, which were not farre from the Camp, some Horses and such
as were lightly Armed. The which were charged and broken by
the <hi>Sclauonians,</hi> as well by reason of the multitude of their
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:16537:38"/>
Souldiers, as for that the middest of their battell was strongly fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
In regard of the Horse-men, they were forced to flye shamefully
vnto their Campe: From thence thorough the aduantage of the place,
they marcht speedily against those which kept the Plaine,<note place="margin">A defeate of the <hi>Etoliens</hi> by the <hi>Sclauonians</hi>
               </note> whom they
charged and put presently to flight. The <hi>Midionians</hi> sally forth, and
pursue them; so as there was a great slaughter of the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Prisoners, with the spoile of all their baggage, hauing found no
resistance. When as the <hi>Sclauonians</hi> had performed their Kings
Commaund, and shipt all their baggage and booty, they set sayle and
retire to their houses.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Midionians</hi> also being thus preserued contrary to their hope,
they assembled, and held a Councell among themselues, as well for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
affaires, as for the diuision of the booty taken from the Enemy, and
of their Armes, to deuide them in common, by an example taken of
him who had beene Chiose of the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> and of those which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the decree of the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> should succeed him: as if Fortune had
done it willingly, to make the world know her force by the misfortune
of the others. In truth, these in a short time made their Enemies to
feele the miseries which they themselues expected suddainly. The
<hi>Etoliens</hi> after this misery serued for an example to the world, not to
hold future things as already done, nor to put their hope in things which
may succeed otherwise: And that wee must alwayes reserue some part
in things which may happen contrary to our hope, as well as in all other
actions, (seeing we are men) as in the affaires of Warre.</p>
            <p>When as the victorious ships were arriued, King <hi>Agron</hi> transported

Wherefore after they had spoiled the whole Prouince, they
made a truce with the <hi>Epirofes</hi> by the which they yeelded the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens

            <p>After that the <hi>Epirotes</hi> had ended their Affaires farre better than

it fit to let things passe in this manner: But acknowledging their negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence

suffered the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> name to grow great there, they resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to repaire this errour: Yet they durst not begin a Warre, fearing a

the History will not onely be pleasant, and worthy of memory, but
most necessary to vnderstand with what people afterwards, and in what

And first wee will speake of their Prouince, what scituation,

            <p>All <hi>Italy</hi> is of a triangular forme.<note place="margin">A description of <hi>Italy.</hi>

and that which tends towards the South and West, is inclosed by the
Seas of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Sicily.</hi> These two sides ioyned together make the
point of the Triangle: Where in front lies the Promontory, which
the people of the Countrey call <hi>Cocynthe,</hi> and hath its aspect to the
South, deuiding the <hi>Ionian</hi> Sea from the <hi>Sicilian.</hi> The third side,
which tends to the <hi>Pole Artique,</hi> and to the firme land, is limited by
the continuation of the <hi>Alps,</hi> the which beginning at <hi>Marseilles,</hi> and

Within on this side which wee meane to bee bounded by the <hi>Alps,</hi>
and is as it were the Basis or foundation of the Triangle, there are
from the Southerne Countrey, tending towards the North, Plaines
which make the end of <hi>Italy,</hi> and are the greatest and the most fertill
in all <hi>Europe:</hi> whose figure is likewise Triangular.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Appenin</hi> Hill, and the <hi>Alps</hi> ioyning together make a point
of the Triangle, neere vnto the <hi>Sardinian</hi> Sea, and aboue <hi>Marseilles.</hi>
That side which lookes to the North is made by the <hi>Alpes,</hi> whereof
the extent is two thousand, two hundred Furlongs. That side which
hath its aspect to the South, is bounded by the <hi>Appenin</hi> Hill, the
which hath three thousand and three score Furlongs in length. The
shore of the <hi>Adriatique</hi> Sea holds the fashion of the foundation of the
whole figure, whereof the greatnesse (which begins at the Towne of

            <p>It is easie to conceiue that the aboundance of other particular things

when any necessary occasion shall be offred: being most certaine that
<hi>Timeus</hi> did not vnderstand those things which did concerne this

            <p>The <hi>Tyrreins</hi> haue formerly held all the Champion Countrey, which

               </hi> at what time also they purchased a greate esteeme of vertue.
Wherefore Historiographers must not attribute the power of the <hi>Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reins</hi>
to the Region which they now inhabite. The <hi>Gaules</hi> frequented
much with them, by reason of their neighbour-hood: who moued
with the beauty and fertility of the Countrey, vpon a small occasion
made Warre against them, and hauing chased them away, setled
themselues there. The Countrey betwixt the <hi>Poe</hi> and the <hi>Alpes,</hi> is

liuing in Villages without any inclosure, hauing no furniture for

no profession but of Warre and Tillage, leading a simple life without
Arts or Sciences. Their wealth was in Gold and Cattell, for that
they were things easie to transport where they pleased, when necessity
pressed them. They did all striue to purchase Friends, for they much

esteemed a man that was honoured by many. In the beginning they
not onely held this Countrey, but they also drew vnto them a great

            <p>Soone after making Warre against the <hi>Romanes,</hi> they defeated them

                  <hi>Rome</hi> taken by the <hi>Gaules.</hi>
               </note> and put them shamefully to flight. Within three

their Citty: For that they were forced to returne, by reason of the
inuasions which the <hi>Venetiens</hi> made into their Country. From thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth
they began to make Warre amongst themselues: For they which
dwelt at the Foote of the Mountaines, seeing the others to increase
daily in power, made Warre often against them. In the meane time,
the <hi>Romanes</hi> recouering their Forces, preuailed ouer the <hi>Latins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirty yeares after the taking of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Gaules</hi> returned with a

               </note> But for that the <hi>Romanes</hi> were surprized, and
had no leisure to Leuy an Army, nor to require succours from their
Allies, they made no resistance against them. And when as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
twelue yeares after, the <hi>Romanes</hi> being presently aduertised of
their comming, and drawing together the succours of their Allies,
marcht with great courage to incounter them with an Army, desiring
nothing more than Battell, by the meanes whereof they should soone
decide who should haue the Empire. The <hi>Gaules</hi> amazed at their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
and withall there falling a mutiny amongst them, they made
their Retreate little lesse than a flight, and so continued thirteene yeares
without making Warre.</p>
            <p>But when they saw the <hi>Romans</hi> power increase daily, they beganne
to treate of Peace, the which they obtayned, and continued thirty
yeares without Warre. The <hi>Transalpins</hi> renewed the Warre against
them. Wherefore fearing to be assailed on two sides, they intreated
them, that for asmuch as they were of one Nation they would not be
their enemies. Moreouer they sent them rich presents, intreating
them to turne the Warre against the <hi>Romans,</hi> and that they would assist
them with all their meanes. Whereunto being easily perswaded, they
marcht all with one consent against the <hi>Romans</hi> by <hi>Tuscany</hi> (for a great

               </note>
they retired out of the <hi>Romane</hi> Prouinces to their owne Houses without

great booty, so as they not onely lost a great part of their booty, but
also the best part of their Empire: the which doth vsually happen to
the <hi>Gaules,</hi> by reason of their gormondize and drunkennesse. Foure

Some few dayes after they assailed them againe, and had a Battell neere

those few which remained were chased out of the Country. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
the whole Country, and re-peopled the Towne againe, calling
it <hi>Senogallia,</hi> as it had beene formerly, when it was first inhabited by
the <hi>Gaules.</hi>

Forces they could make, and all the Youth that could beare Armes, and
marcht against the <hi>Romanes,</hi> where they were defeated and slaine, so
as they were in a manner vtterly ruined. Wherefore their pride abated,
they made an agreement with them by Embassadours. These things
hapned, three yeares after the descent of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi>

yeares after the <hi>Gaules</hi> had beene defeated in <hi>Delphos.</hi> Behold how
in that time Fortune (as a mortall plague among the <hi>Gaules</hi>) persecuted
them in all places. But the <hi>Romanes</hi> made a double profit by the battels
which we haue formerly related: For being accustomed to fight with
the <hi>Gaules,</hi> who had beene held very fierce and fearefull, they became
good Souldiers against <hi>Pyrrhus.</hi> Thus by little and little they abated
the pride of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> so as afterwards they were much more assured,
first to fight with <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> for <hi>Italy,</hi> and afterwards against the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi>
for the Soueraignty of <hi>Sicily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Gaules</hi> weakned by the meanes of the former Battels, liued in
peace forty fiue yeares, without any breach of the accord made with
the <hi>Romanes.</hi> But after that the old men, (who had vndergone the
dangers, and felt so many losses) were dead, the Youth who were of
a harsh and bad disposition, and had not felt the miseries of former
times, grew insolent. These (as it is willingly the nature of men) began
presently to vndertake the Warre, and to bee enemies to the <hi>Romanes,</hi>
whatsoeuer should succeed, and moreouer to send to craue succours
from the <hi>Transalpins.</hi> It is true, that in the beginning the Princes did
mannage the affaires without the consent of the people: So as it hapned,
that when as the <hi>Transalpins</hi> were come to <hi>Rimeni,</hi>
               <note place="margin">King <hi>Etas</hi> and <hi>Gastus</hi> slaine</note> the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

            <p>Fiue yeares after, <hi>Marcus Lepidus</hi> being Consull, <hi>Caeius Flaminius</hi>

most part of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> especially the <hi>Bolonians,</hi> who were neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
vnto the <hi>Romanes,</hi> were much incensed therewith, thinking that
the <hi>Romanes</hi> did not fight for principallity or Glory, but for pillage and
their ruine. Wherefore the <hi>Millannois</hi> and <hi>Bolonians</hi> consenting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
sent suddainly to the other <hi>Gaules,</hi> which dwell beyond the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines

fight for pay, (for so the word imports) offering to their Kings <hi>Congoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
and <hi>Aneroeste</hi> a great summe of present money. They acquaint
them with the great felicity of the <hi>Romanes;</hi> and what a benefit it
would be if they could vanquish them.</p>
            <p>By this meanes they mooue them to make War against the <hi>Romans;</hi>
the which was easie to perswade, considering the former Reason. They
promise them also to make them Companions in this Warre, reducing

               </note> who had not only

Citty of <hi>Rome</hi> with wonderfull celerity: Where they had taken great
spoiles, and after they had beene masters thereof seauen moneths, they
restored them the Empire willingly, and returned into their Countrey
safe with all their booty. In propounding these things brauely vnto
them, they incouraged these Kings and the <hi>Gaules,</hi> so as there was
neuer descent made out of that Country, of a greater Army, nor more

considering that these affaires were more pressing, for that these

            <p>When as the <hi>Gessates</hi> had drawne a great number of men together

            <p>The City of <hi>Rome</hi> was heauy, and much troubled, and did not
attend this great attempt of the <hi>Gaules</hi> without great feare. They
then remembred their former defeates, and feared this Nation, as

of their Youth, desiring to know the number of Souldiers of all
the <hi>Italian</hi> Army. They likewise made provision of Corne and
Armes, and of all other things necessary, in greater abundance than
they had done in former times.</p>
            <p>The other people of <hi>Italy</hi> were no lesse diligent, they were so
much amazed at the descent of the <hi>Gaules:</hi> so as they did not thinke to
fight for the <hi>Romans,</hi> nor for their Empire, but euery man for his

First, the Consuls went to field with foure <hi>Romare</hi> Legions,
whereof eyther consisted of fiue thousand two hundred Foote, and

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:16537:46"/>
that the Souldiers haue no meanes to flye. In regard of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi>
they had hope of Victory, for that they saw their Enemies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed,
as it were deliuered into their hands: On the other side they
feared the fury and order of their Army, the sound of Trumpets and
Clairons was terrible, with the which all the Troope made a great cry
and shoute, so as there was an incredible noise. They could not heare
the Trumpets and Souldiers, and moreouer, the neighbour places see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to ecchoe forth their cries.</p>
            <p>It was a terrible thing to see the forlorne hope march naked. Beleeue
me, these great naked bodies, with their motions vnder their Bucklers
were maruelous and fearefull. The beauty and riches of their Appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
gaue also a great luster. For the whole Army shined with chaines
of Gold, and Silkes wouen with purple. The which the <hi>Romanes</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing,
they were partly amazed, and partly encouraged with the hope
of spoile. Finally, the taile of the Army which was armed, was not
gauld by the <hi>Roman</hi> Archers, who doe vsually march before the Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.
But the forlorne hope which fought naked before their Troopes,
were contrary to all hope much annoyed:<note place="margin">The defeate of the forlorne hope of the <hi>Gaules.</hi>
               </note> For they could not couer
their great naked bodies with their <hi>French</hi> Bucklers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore
the Arrowes fell easily vpon them. Finally, when they saw themselues
thus beaten, and could not bee reuenged of the Archers by reason of
the distance, and for the multitude of Arrowes which flew from all
parts, they cast themselues like desperate mad-men, some vpon their
Enemies, where they were slaine: others retired vpon their owne
Troopes, who being all bloody, daunted the courage of the rest, and
put them in disorder.</p>
            <p>By this meanes the fiercenesse of the <hi>Gessates,</hi> which made the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne

a fatre off with their Arrowes and Darts as formerly, but hand to hand

not strong enough, were of aduice to call the <hi>Gaules</hi> to their aide, with
whom they were in league. But for that they feared their reuolt, &amp; they
were to fight with men of the same Nation, they held it dangerous to trust
in such men in so great a danger, and especially to put their safeties in
their handsat such a time, and in such an action: Finally, being neere the
Riuer, they call the <hi>Cenomans,</hi> and cause them to passe. When all were
past they brake the Bridge, depriuing them at one instant of the meanes
to ioyne with their Enemies, and leauing their Men no hope of safety but
in the victory.</p>
            <p>When this was done they put their men in order, and off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:16537:47"/>
of fighting were spent: Which being done, leauing their Pikes, they
should flye to their Swords; ordayning it in this manner, for that they
had seene by the former Warres, that the <hi>Gaules</hi> had a furious poynt,
and afterwards their hearts were faint and effeminate, and that more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
their Swords as we haue sayd, were only fit to giue one blow;<note place="margin">The vneasinesse of the <hi>Gaules</hi> Swords.</note> but
afterwards their length grew crooked, and the edge turned by reason
of the breadth: So as if they did not suffer them to set the poynt to the

blow wrought no effect.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romanes</hi> following the Commaund of the <hi>Tribunes,</hi> charge
their enemies with great blowes vpon the brest with their Pikes. The
<hi>Gaules</hi> on the other side imploy all their fury to cut them. Then the

this meanes the fury of the <hi>Gaules:</hi> And taking from them all meanes
to steppe backe, which these people are accustomed to vse in their

of their length, but only to giue one blow a farre off. But the <hi>Romans</hi>
by meanes of their short Swords, wherewith they did not strike like

            <p>Behold how the prouidence of the <hi>Tribunes</hi> preuailed much; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

they had all fallen into the Riuer by the errour of the Consull. Yet

Of whom we might haue considered in how short a time they

leauing them a small portion within the <hi>Alpes,</hi> wee haue thought it
good to relate summarily their first attempts, the successe of affaires,

make such accidents knowne to those of future times: to the end that our

which Barbarians doe often make: and that they rather try their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,

but a man will not be amazed for riches, forces, or the multitude of men,

bee conceiued the Warre would soone breake out. At the same
time the <hi>Achaiens</hi> with <hi>Phillip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> and their Allies,
made Warre against the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> which they called the Warre of
the Allies.</p>
            <p>As wee haue related the Warre which the <hi>Romans</hi> made against
the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in <hi>Sicily</hi> and in <hi>Affricke,</hi> and the things which
followed, and being now come according to the order of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
to the beginning of the Warre betwixt the Allies, and
to the second of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> which they call the Warre
of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> seeing wee haue resolued to begin our course with those
times, it is reasonable wee should come to the Gests and Exploits
of the <hi>Grecians:</hi> to the end that making by this meanes a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all parts, wee may begin the History which wee haue
resolued on, when as wee shall come to the same end of all
things.</p>
            <p>As therefore wee haue not vndertaken to write the actions onely
of one Nation or another, as other Historiographers haue done, as
of the <hi>Grecians</hi> or <hi>Persians,</hi> but of all the parts of the world together,
which are come to our knowledge, (for that this present time hath
beene of great vse, whereof we will speake more amply in another place)
it shall be fitting to make a summary mention of the most knowne Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Countries of the whole World, before the beginning of
our worke.</p>
            <p>In regard of the actions of the <hi>Asians</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> it shall bee
sufficient to deliuer those of our time: considering that many haue
written the deeds of times past, whereof no man is ignorant:
Neither is there any thing innouated, which is not according to the
Commentaries of Historiographers. In regard of the people of
<hi>Achaia,</hi> and the house of <hi>Macedon,</hi> it is fitting to search out the times past
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:16537:49"/>
summarily: As for that which concernes the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> the proofe
will bee easie: And as for the <hi>Achaiens,</hi> there hath beene made (as
wee haue formerly sayd) an augmentation and wonderfull accord in
our time.<note place="margin">All <hi>Mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

beene at this day made so great a change, as they haue not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
friendship, and a strict league, but moreouer they vse the same
Lawes, the same weight, the same measure, the same money, and
more, the same Princes, the same Councell, and the same Iudges:
So as there is no defect in <hi>Morea</hi> for the making of a Burgesse, but
that they dwelt not all in one Towne: All the rest was alike and
the same thing.</p>
            <p>It shall not bee therefore vnfitting to shew how the Name of the

               </note> You must vnderstand that they
which were first so called, had no better Countrey, nor more Townes,

and <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> doe farre exceed the other people of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi>
both in number of men and Townes: Neither is there any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in <hi>Greece</hi> which passeth them in prowesse and virtue. What is
the cause then that these men whom wee haue named, and the other
people of <hi>Morea,</hi> haue willingly suffred not onely the Comminalty of
the <hi>Achaiens,</hi> but also to take the Name? It were a folly to say
that it was by chance. Wherefore it were better to seeke the cause
without the which wee cannot finish those things which are done
with reason, nor those which seemne to bee done without it. For
my part I conceiue it was the equality, and the common liberty
which was kept amongst them all, as a certaine president of a true
Common-wealth: For there is no Citty in all <hi>Greece,</hi> where there
are found better Lawes. Behold the cause which hath caused the
greatest part of <hi>Morea</hi> willingly to follow this Common-wealth
Some thorough reason and parswasion, others forced by little and
little with the time, and yet they haue presently pacified their discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.
And for that they did no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> from the beginning leaue more to one

of great efficacy, that is, Equality and Clemency: Behold the
cause which wee must imagine, for the which all <hi>Morea</hi> being of one
will and accord, attained to this prosperity and peace wherein wee see
it at this day.</p>
            <p>It is true, that this manner of liuing, and meanes of gouernment of
a Common-wealth was long obserued by the <hi>Acheins:</hi> the which is
probable by the testimony of many witnesses. Yet wee will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
but one or two at this time. You must vnderstand that at what
time a Company of the <hi>Pythagorians</hi> were burnt for a secret conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in the Region of <hi>Italy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Pythàgori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> burnt in <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </note> which they then called great <hi>Greece:</hi> It
happened that the Countrey and the Townes were much afflicted with
murthers and sedition, by a strange alteration of Common-weales whose
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:16537:49"/>
Princes were wickedly slaine. And therefore Embassadours came from
all parts to pacifie their debates. Who leauing all the rest, they referr'd
themselues in all their quarrels to that which the <hi>Acheins</hi> should
decree. Soone after they resolued to vse their Lawes, and to frame
their Common-wealth like vnto theirs. Without doubt the <hi>Crotoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates,
Sybarites,</hi> and <hi>Caulonites,</hi> after they had ended their quarrels in a
friendly manner, edified a Temple in publique, to <hi>Iupiter Omarie,</hi>
where they might assemble the people, and giue them iustructions.
Moreouer hauing accepted the Institutions and Lawes of the <hi>Acheins,</hi>
they would onely liue in them, and erect their Common-wealth. But
the tyranny of <hi>Denis</hi> of <hi>Syracusa</hi> and the <hi>Gaules,</hi> who at that time spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Countrey,<note place="margin">The <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> and <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bains.</hi>
               </note> hindered them from bringing their enterprize to an
end. Moreouer, after the defeate of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> beyond all hope,
before <hi>Luctres,</hi> and that they of <hi>Thebes</hi> had already troubled the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
of <hi>Gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce,</hi> there was a great mutiny and a strange combustion
throughout all <hi>Greece,</hi> namely, betwixt the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and the
<hi>Thebains:</hi> For that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> conceiued they had beene van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished,
and the others did not thinke they had gotten the Victory.
Notwithstanding either of them by a common consent made choice of
the <hi>Acheins</hi> among all the <hi>Grecians,</hi> to whose iudgement they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
themselues touching their quarrels, not hauing so much regard
to their forces or power (for in truth it was the least of all the Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Greece</hi>) as to the faith and iustice of the people, which at that
time was held great in the opinion of the World. It is true, they had
then but bare virtue, hauing done nothing worthy of fame or estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Wherefore their comminalty did not increase much for that
they had not any Lord which was worthy to gouerne them, for that
they had beene alwaies kept vnder by the Empire of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi>
or <hi>Macedonians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after by succession of time they had found Gouernours worthy
of their estate, they presently purchased honour and glory. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
all <hi>Morea,</hi> which was an excellent worke:<note place="margin">Arate.</note> whereof no man
doubts but <hi>Arate</hi> the <hi>Sicyonien</hi> had beene the Authour and contriuer:
the which <hi>Philopomene</hi> the <hi>Megalopolitein</hi> finished, and afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed:
and that <hi>Licerta</hi> was the third which amplified and augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it, and subsequently all his Companions. Hereafter wee will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour
as much as the Subiect shall require, to relate their deeds, the
manner and the time: Yet wee will make a summary mention of the
actions of <hi>Arate</hi> at this time, and hereafter, for that hee hath compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
all things in his Commentaries according vnto truth plainely
and amply. But as for others our discourse shall be something more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
and more copious.</p>
            <p>It is true, that in my opinion, the declaration would bee more easie,
and the History more plaine to those that desire to know it, if wee take
it from the time, when as the <hi>Acheins,</hi> who had beene disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
into diuers Citties by the Princes of <hi>Macedon,</hi> drew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
againe together as it were in one body, and afterwards they
augmented in such sort, as they came to this great amplitude whereof
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:16537:50"/>
wee haue hitherto spoken in particular, and which continues vnto
this day.</p>
            <p>They of <hi>Patras</hi> and the <hi>Dymensorins</hi> made a league together,<note place="margin">A league be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensorins</hi> and them of <hi>Patra.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Sygus.</note> After whom the Regall
power began to be tedious, for that the Children of <hi>Sygus</hi> did not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
the Prouince legally, but by Tyranny. Wherefore they chased
away their Kings, and gouerned in common: wherein they liued di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly
according to the diuersity of the times, vntill the dayes of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
and <hi>Phillip,</hi> yet striuing with all their meanes to gouerne their
Common-weales in a Comminalty, which contayned twelue Townes,
who are yet in being, except <hi>Olena</hi> and <hi>Elix</hi> which an Earthquake swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed

            </p>
            <p>But in the time of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and before the <hi>Olimpiade</hi> which we
haue mentioned, they grew into so great dissention, namely for the
Kings of <hi>Macedon,</hi> that the Townes thus deuided, held it would bee

drew vnto them the forces of <hi>Demetrius</hi> and <hi>Cassander,</hi> and soone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
those of <hi>Antigonus:</hi> The others were imployed by the Kings,
whereof there were many at that time in <hi>Greece.</hi> But in the hundred
and foure and twentieth <hi>Olimpiade,</hi> as wee haue sayd, they began againe
to be reconciled,<note place="margin">The beginning of the league.</note> at such time as <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of <hi>Epirus</hi> past into <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, they of <hi>Patras, Dymes, Tritee,</hi> and <hi>Phare,</hi> were reconciled,
when as there was no title of common alliance betwixt them. Fiue
yeeres after they of <hi>Egire</hi> chased away their Garrison, and ioyned to
the rest: whom the <hi>Buriens</hi> followed killing their King: and soone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>Cerauniens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When as <hi>Iseas</hi> (who at that time was King of the <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rauni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens</hi>)
saw that they of <hi>Egire</hi> had chased away their Garrison,<note place="margin">Iseas King.</note> and they
of <hi>Bure</hi> had slaine their King; seeing himselfe in a manner inuolued with
Warre, hee relinquisht the principallity, leauing the administration of
the Common-weale to the <hi>Acheins,</hi> after the Couenants concluded
with them to saue his life. But why haue wee brought these things
from so farre? To the end first that the World may know by what
meanes, and at what time, and who were the first among the <hi>Acheins,</hi>
which rectified this comminalty againe, the which at this day wee see
flourish: And that knowing their order, euery man may easily beleeue
not onely our History, but also our actions. Beleeue mee, they haue
alwayes obserued one course concerning the gouernment of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
and one reason by the which keeping continually an
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:16537:50"/>
equallity among them, and defeating those who of themselues, or
by their Kings laboured to take their Country, they haue in the end
preuailed in all their interprises, as well by their owne forces as by the
helpe of their Allies.</p>
            <p>Finally those things which haue beene since done in this Prouince,
ought to be attributed to the <hi>Acheins,</hi> who being companions to the

themselues of that which was done, hauing no other thought but of
liberty, and the common accord of <hi>Morea.</hi> But we shall see it more
plainly by their actions.</p>
            <p>All these Citties which we haue named, did administer the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
from the beginning fiue and twenty yeares with the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheins,</hi>
making choyse of one <hi>Questor</hi> and two Captaines. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
they resolued to haue but one, who should haue the charge of

When his foure yeares were expired,<note place="margin">Arate.</note> 
               <hi>Arate</hi> the <hi>Sicyonien</hi> was
chosen at the age of twenty yeares. Who presently by his singular
Virtue, and great courage, freed the Country from Tyrants, and resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Common-wealth of the <hi>Acheins,</hi> to the which from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
he bare a great affection. Some time after hauing gouerned
eight yeares, he was chosen againe:<note place="margin">The Fort of <hi>Corinthe</hi> taken by <hi>Arate.</hi>
               </note> And then he beganne to thinke of
the meanes by the which he might take the Fort of <hi>Corinthe,</hi> which
<hi>Antigonus</hi> then held. The which after he had effected, he freed all
<hi>Morea</hi> from great feare: And when as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were freed from
Tyranny, he ioyned them to the <hi>Acheins.</hi> Some few dayes after he
did the like to the <hi>Megareins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These things hapned the yeare before the battell of the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
by the which they were forced to abandon <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all his interprises, he spent the remainder of his life in the gouernment
of the Common weale, studying by all meanes how to chase the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians</hi>
out of <hi>Morea,</hi> to ruine the Kings, and to preserue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
liberty of the Country. And therefore he resisted the attempts
and practises of <hi>Antigonus Gonate,</hi> whilest he liued, and the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse
of the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> who with <hi>Antigonus</hi> grew so audacious and

in this Warre, in assailing the <hi>Acheins</hi> on all side they should
easily defeate them. The which vndoubtedly had hapned, if <hi>Arate</hi> a
man of great Virtue and Courage, (which they did not consider) had
not taken vpon him the defence of the others.</p>
            <p>They began a most wicked War with all their Forces; wherein they
were not only frustrated in their expectance, but they made <hi>Arate</hi> more
stout and Resolute, being then Commaunder of the <hi>Acheins</hi> and the
whole Nation, by his pollicy and diligent prouidence in all things, as
we shall see by that which followes. For when like a man well aduised,
he had considered that the <hi>Etoliens</hi> were ashamed to declare Warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Acheins,</hi> for the benefits they had lately receiued from them
during the Warre of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and that for this cause they had soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> to attempt it: And that they were transported
with enuy against the good Fortune of the <hi>Acheins,</hi> so as they were
nothing incensed against <hi>Cleomines,</hi> who had taken from them by
stealth <hi>Tegea, Mantinea,</hi> and <hi>Orthomene,</hi> very strong Townes of
<hi>Etolia,</hi> but contrarywise they confirmed them willingly vnto him; and
that moreouer they sought all occasions of Warre, onely for a desire
they had to Reigne, the <hi>Acheins</hi> hauing neuer offended them, suffring
the King to violate his Faith vnto them, and that by fraud he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from them such rich Townes, to the end that the forces of <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi>
(increased by this meanes) might with more ease defeate the
Comminalty of the <hi>Acheins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arate</hi> then (as I haue sayd) and the other Captaines considering these
things, resolued not to declare any Warre, but onely to resist the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> with all their power. Behold the first
Resolution of the Captaines. But soone after when as they saw that
<hi>Cleomenes</hi> built a Citty without feare, which afterwards was called
<hi>Athenes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Athenes.</note> in the Country of the <hi>Megalopolitains,</hi> and that he declared
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:16537:51"/>
himselfe an open enemy to the <hi>Acheins,</hi> they make an assembly, where
it was resolued to make open War against the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and not
by Dissimulation.</p>
            <p>This Warre called <hi>Cleominique</hi> beganne thus at that time.<note place="margin">The <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nique</hi> Warre.</note> In the
which the <hi>Acheins</hi> beganne first to resist the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> with their
owne Forces, without the helpe of any other, both for that they held
it a greater honour to defend their Countrey and Townes themselues
then with assistance of others: And they likewise indeauoured to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
their friendship by all meanes with <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> fearing least hee
should be discontented, if they should require succours from any others
then from him. But when the Warre was begunne, and that <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
in ruining the Common-weale, had turned a iust Empire into a
Tyranny,<note place="margin">A good confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of <hi>Arate.</hi>
               </note> gouerning the Warre with Policy and Courage: <hi>Arate</hi>
fore-eeing future things a farre off, as a man who vnderstood the
Counsell and presumption of the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> was of opinion that they
must breake their attempts. And considering that <hi>Antigonus</hi> was a
man of great experience in the Arte of Warre, and more sound of his
Faith then any other:<note place="margin">The nature of Kings</note> Knowing that Kings by nature haue neither friend
nor Foe, measuring Friendship and Hatred according to their profit, he
resolued to addresse himselfe vnto him, and to let him visibly see the
euent of the Warre, and finally to make a League with him. He had
many reasons why he should not do it openly: For if <hi>Cleomenes</hi> and the
<hi>Etoliens</hi> had beene aduertised, they would haue made greater prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for the Warre, and most of the <hi>Acheins</hi> would haue left him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
amazed at such an alteration, for that they would haue thought,
their Commaunder would haue fled to the enemy for refuge like a man
in despaire. Wherefore to auoyde these inconueniences, he not onely
kept these things secret, but he spake and did many things contrary to
his thought, by the which he shewed the contrary of that which he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
practised.</p>
            <p>Seeing then the <hi>Megalopolitains</hi> to bee more prest with Warre then
any other, beeing neighbours to the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and hauing no
hope to obtayne succours from the <hi>Acheins,</hi> being subiect to the same
Warre, and being moreouer in League and friendship with the <hi>Mac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians,</hi>
for that they had done great pleasures to <hi>Philip</hi> the Sonne of
<hi>Amyntas,</hi> there was no doubt but as soone as <hi>Cleomenes</hi> should begin
the Warre against them, they would require succours from <hi>Antigonus</hi>
and the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> Finally he declared his secret to <hi>Nicophanes</hi> and
<hi>Cercides Megalopolitains.</hi> They had beene friends to his Father,<note place="margin">Nicophanes.</note> and
seemed fit men to mannage this businesse. By their meanes hee incites
the <hi>Megalopolitaines.</hi> to send an Embassie to the <hi>Acheins,</hi> to intrea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them to demaund succours from <hi>Antigonus.</hi> The <hi>Megalopolitains</hi> send
<hi>Nicophanes</hi> and <hi>Cercides</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cercides.</note> to the <hi>Acheins,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A good inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Arate.</note> with Commission after their
consent to go to <hi>Antigonus,</hi> the which the <hi>Acheins</hi> did easily allow.
This Embassie went to King <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and let him vnderstand their
Charge: and in regard of the Affaires which concerne their Countrey,
they deliuered only those things which were most necessary in few
words: But they made a long Discourse of the whole in generall, as <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:16537:52"/>
had instructed them. They layd before him the attempts which
the <hi>Etoliens</hi> and <hi>Cleomenes</hi> might make, confessing that this Warre for
the present was of great consequence for the <hi>Acheins.</hi> But if the others
preuailed in their interprize, it would be much more dangerous for
him. They make no doubt, but the <hi>Acheins</hi> being assailed at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
by these two forces, they would bee easily ruined: So there is
lesse doubt, that if <hi>Cleomenes</hi> and the <hi>Etoliens</hi> haue the Victory, that
they will not bee satisfied therewith: For you must vnderstand that
<hi>Morea,</hi> no nor all <hi>Greece</hi> cannot glut the couetousnesse of the <hi>Etoliens.</hi>
In regard of the ambition of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> although hee seemes for the
present not to affect any thing but the principallity of <hi>Morea,</hi> yet if
he preuaile, he will neuer cease vntill he hath Conquered all <hi>Greece:</hi>
Whereunto he can neuer attaine before he hath ruined the principallity
of <hi>Macedon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By these reasons and such like, they mooue the King to thinke care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
of things to come, and to consider what may seeme fittest for his
affaires, whether to Allie himselfe to the <hi>Acheins</hi> and <hi>Beociens,</hi> and to

breake the accord made with the <hi>Acheins,</hi> during the Warre of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi>
and should still make shew to persist in friendship, as they
did yet, the <hi>Acheins</hi> would be too strong to defend themselues against
<hi>Cleomenes.</hi> And therefore if Fortune fauours them, they shall not
neede any mans succour. But if contrarywise it should bee rather for
the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> they intreated the King that he would be pleased to giue
them succours, and that (not losing the opportunity of the time,) hee
would preserue <hi>Morea,</hi> before it should be vtterly ruined.</p>
            <p>They sayd moreouer that he had no reason to care at that time for
Faith and Recompence, and that <hi>Arate</hi> would finde the meanes in
the greatest heate of affaires, to giue him satisfaction, and that hee
would aduertise him of the time when he should neede succours. When
as <hi>Antigonus</hi> had heard the Embassie, hee did wonderfully commend
the prudence of <hi>Arate,</hi> and made answere that hee was ready to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
the danger. Moreouer he wrote letters to the <hi>Megalopolitains,</hi> by
the which he sent them word that hee was ready to giue them succours,
so as it were with the consent of the <hi>Acheins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This done <hi>Nicophanes</hi> and <hi>Cercides</hi> returned to their Countrey:
Where after they had deliuered their Letters, they made report of the
Kings good affection. The <hi>Megalopolitains</hi> ioyfull of this newes,
sent an Embassie againe to the <hi>Acheins,</hi> intreating them to contract
with <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and that they might relye in him for all his businesse.
<hi>Arate</hi> hearing all this by <hi>Nicophanes,</hi> and the good affection the King
bare vnto the <hi>Acheins,</hi> and to himselfe, was wonderfully ioyfull,

               <hi>Megalopolitains</hi> aimed at, that the <hi>Acheins</hi> should submit themselues
vnder <hi>Antigonus</hi> in all this Warre:<note place="margin">The fore-sight of <hi>Arate.</hi>
               </note> For he was not of aduice to require

would not haue it done at his request alone, but by all the <hi>Acheins.</hi> In

against the Comminalty of the <hi>Acheins,</hi> they should not lay
the blame vpon him, as if he had indiscreetly giuen the aduice for the
drawing of the King into their Countrey, who was offended for the
taking of the Fort of <hi>Corinthe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Embassadours of the <hi>Megalopolitains</hi> came into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
and had made relation of <hi>Antigonus</hi> his Letters, and of the Kings
loue and affection, and had made a remonstrance vnto the <hi>Acheins</hi> for
a peace with <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and that it seemed the whole assembly found
it good, <hi>Arate</hi> commended the Kings affection, and the good desire
of the whole assembly. Yet he let them vnderstand by many reasons
that they should indeauour to keepe their Townes and Countrey with
their owne forces, but if they could not effect it, then they could
not doe any thing more commendable and more profitable. But if
Fortune were contrary vnto them, that they must first doe all that
could be possible: And if there were no more hope, then they should
require succours from their friends. The whole assembly allowed easily
of his Councell; and it was resolued, that for the present they should or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
no new thing, and that the <hi>Acheins</hi> should mannage this war alone.</p>
            <p>But when as (during these negotiations) <hi>Ptolomy</hi> had furnished <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi>
with men, and other things necessary for the Warre, desiring by

<hi>Arate</hi> seeing himselfe inuironed with so many miseries, knew it was

that hee did not hope <hi>Antigonus</hi> would succour him, if they did not
deliuer him for his security the Fort of <hi>Corinthe,</hi> which they called

And therefore hee deferred the Councell to aduise of the meanes of

held. By this meanes hee repaired the wrong which hee had done
vnto the King, and it serued him for a pledge, and as it were a Fort
and retreate for the future Warre.</p>
            <p>But when as <hi>Cleomenes</hi> vnderstood the league which the <hi>Acheins</hi>
had made with <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and that the Fort had beene freely deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

neere vnto <hi>Isthmus,</hi> and rampred diligently with Pallisadoes and Dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
the place which lies betwixt the Fortresse and the Mountaines,
which they of the Countrey call <hi>Onies,</hi> as if hee had a hope to make
himselfe Lord of all <hi>Morea. Antigonus</hi> who had his Army ready,
expected onely the opportunity of the time. But when hee saw by
those things which had happened, according to the aduertisement of
<hi>Arate,</hi> that the time approached of <hi>Cleomenes</hi> voyage into <hi>Thessaly,</hi>
hee causeth his Army to march towards <hi>Isthmus</hi> by <hi>Beocia,</hi> hauing
aduertised the <hi>Acheins</hi> of his affaires: For the <hi>Etoliens</hi> being discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at his descent, sent him word, that hee should not passe within
the streights of <hi>Thermophiles,</hi> and if hee vndertooke it, they would
take Armes to hinder his passage. Thus <hi>Antigonus</hi> and <hi>Cleomenes</hi>
lodged their Armies before one another. The one to enter into <hi>Morea</hi>
and the other to keepe his Frontier. And although the <hi>Acheins</hi> had

               </note> and tooke the Towne of
<hi>Argos,</hi> which was of great consequence vnto them: For by this
meanes the fury of <hi>Cleomenes</hi> was much abated, and the Souldiers
hearts broken, as appeared plainely: For although that <hi>Cleomenes</hi>
Army was much stronger by reason of the opportunity of places, and
abundance of victuals, hauing also good and resolute Souldiers, yet
there was so great and suddaine an alteration after the taking of <hi>Argos,</hi>
that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> leauing all, made a retreate, sauouring of a flight:
So much hee feared that hee should bee inclosed by his cruell
Enemies.</p>
            <p>From thence hee marcht directly to <hi>Argos,</hi> where hee made great
attempts to carry it by assault. But for that the <hi>Acheins</hi> resisted like

into <hi>Morea,</hi> hee tooke <hi>Acrocorinthe.</hi> Then hee made haste to goe to
<hi>Argos,</hi> where he much commended the <hi>Argiues,</hi> and settled an order
for the affaires of the City. From thence he returned againe into <hi>Arcadia</hi>
with his Army, and chased away the Garrisons out of those Forts which

After this in the beginning of Winter, hee sent the <hi>Macedonians</hi> to their
houses, and retired with the mercenaries to <hi>Egia,</hi> there to consult of the
present affaires.</p>

carefully kept, by reason of the presence of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> he had a hope to
surprize it. Wherefore hee marcht suddainly, being guided by some
<hi>Messeniens,</hi> who being chased and banisht from their Countrey, had
retired to <hi>Megalopolis:</hi> and brought them by Night into the City. But
day being come, he was in danger to be defeated with his whole Army,
considering the great resistance the <hi>Megalopolitains</hi> made: the which
happened vnto him three Moneths before, when he ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

places of aduantage.</p>
            <p>After he had taken and spoiled the Citty, and chased away the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galopolitains,</hi>
hee razed<note place="margin">Megalopolin <hi>razed.</hi>

of one man blemisht all the virtue of the <hi>Clitoriens:</hi> This was <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arce</hi>
               <note place="margin">Thearce.</note>
whom with reason the <hi>Clitoriens</hi> denyed to bee borne in their
Countrey, saying, hee was of <hi>Orchomene,</hi> and the Sonne of some
stranger. Moreouer, for that there are some which preferre <hi>Philarchus</hi>
before al others that haue written this History, although that many times
he speakes and iudges of things contrary to <hi>Arate,</hi> I haue thought it
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:16537:54"/>
good, nay rather necessary, not to conceale this: To the end they
may discerne truth from falshood, and the rather for that we haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<hi>Arate.</hi> Hee hath spoken many things throughout the whole
History as Affection hath transported him, which are not needfull to
debate at this present, holding those things to be deliuered by vs, which
hapned at such time as we Write, that is to say, during the <hi>Cleomenique</hi>
Warre: For that they would be more then sufficient to discouer the
errours and faults of this Author.</p>
            <p>First when he labours to set foorth the cruelty of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and of
the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and moreouer that of <hi>Arate</hi> and the <hi>Acheins,</hi> he sayd
that as soone as he had Conquered the <hi>Mantiniens,</hi> they caused them
to suffer great outrages and cruelties, and that the Citty which was
one of the noblest and most auncient of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> fell into so great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
and ruine, as it mooued all <hi>Greece</hi> to weepe and lament. And
when as afterwards he seekes to make the cruelty seeme greater, and to
mooue the Readers hearts, he relates a burning of Women, their haire
scattered vp and downe, their Paps naked, the teares and lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
made by men and women, who dragg'd after them their little
Children and their Parents broken with age. This hee doth often
throughout his whole History, to let euery man see the agrauating of
their miseries. Leauing then this basenesse and effeminacy of his heart,
let vs seeke the things which are most proper and profitable for the
History.</p>
            <p>A Historiographer ought not to mooue the affections of men,<note place="margin">The duty of a Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.</note> nor
seeke occasions fit for it, neyther let him pursue the miseries of men (the
which belongs to the makers of Tragedies) but let him deliuer truly the
sayings and doings of men, although they be not great. Without
doubt a History and a Tragedy, tend not to one and the same end, but
rather are quite contrary.<note place="margin">What is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy.</note> For they must labour in a Tragedy to draw
by coniecture the hearts of the Auditors to Hope, Feare, Care, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and such like affections. But in a History hee must imploy his
whole indeauour to relate truly the sayings and doings of men. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
things that are likely and coniecturall, are necessary in the one, to
abuse the Assistants, and those which are true in this being Written
for the profit of the Readers.</p>
            <p>You must vnderstand likewise that this Historiographer many
times doth not yeild the cause in his History, nor the reason of things,
without the which they cannot easily mooue any to pitty, or indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in humane affaires. But what is he that will not finde it strange to
see a Cittizen whipt: yet if any one be so by reason of his offence, wee
finde it reasonable. And if any one strikes a free man to punish and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
him, shall wee not hold him an honest man and praise worthy?
Murther in a Cittizen is likewise forbidden, and seuerely punisht: But
if any one kils a Thiefe or an Adulterer, is hee not held for innocent?
And if any one kils a Traytor to his Country, or a Tyrant, shall he not
be commended by all the World, held deare and honoured? VVee
must therefore looke to the end in all things, and to the intention of the
man, not to that which is acted, but to the causes and Discourses,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:16537:54"/>
with consideration of the differences. The <hi>Mantiuiens</hi> leauing first
the Common-weale of the <hi>Acheins,</hi> gaue themselues and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey

               </note> and soone after to <hi>Cleomenes.</hi> In the
meane time, whilest they liued vnder the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> the <hi>Acheins</hi>
tooke them againe vnder the Conduct of <hi>Arate,</hi> foure yeeres before
the Descent of <hi>Antigonus:</hi> where they were so far from being punished
for the offence committed, as this easie and suddaine re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>vnion of two
people into one Common-wealth, seemed incredible to the whole
VVorld.</p>
            <p>For as soone as <hi>Arate</hi> was entred, he forbad his men to touch their
good: Calling the Burgesses afterwards together, wishing them not
to care, and that they should inioy their goods, and be assured to liue
in peace, as long as they were vnder the <hi>Acheins</hi> Common-weale.
The <hi>Mantiniens</hi> who seemed to be without hope,<note place="margin">The courteous vsage of <hi>Arate</hi> to the <hi>Manti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> were wonderfully
reioyced at the words of <hi>Arate:</hi> VVherefore they presently changed
their opinion, receiuing those into their Houses, to whom formerly
they had beene deadly enemies, with whom they did communicate
their Goods and VVealth. Finally, they omitted nothing of that
which seemed necessary for the setling of a firme friendshippe; and in
truth it was not without cause. I doe not know if euer any fell into the
hands of more gracious enemies, or being falne into so great inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences,
haue relieued and raised themselues with so little losse: the
which proceeded from the humanity of <hi>Arate</hi> and the <hi>Acheins.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
seeing a farre off the seditions which were renewed amongst
them, and the practize of the <hi>Etoliens</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> they send
an Embassie to the <hi>Acheins,</hi> to deliuer their Town into their protection
and to receiue a Garrison. VVho presently leuied three hundred men,
and sent them to <hi>Mantinea,</hi> these three hundred men of the <hi>Acheins</hi>
nation, leauing their Countrey and all their estates, they remained at
<hi>Mantinea</hi> to preserue their liberty. They had moreouer two hundred
Souldiers that were strangers.</p>
            <p>Soone after there grew a sedition among the <hi>Mantiniens;</hi> wherfore
they called the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> deliuering them the Towne;<note place="margin">The great vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</hi>
               </note> and to
the end their wickednesse might be full and compleat, they murthered
all the <hi>Acheins;</hi> a crime which was most execrable. For seeing they
would leaue the party and friendship of the <hi>Acheins,</hi> they should at
the least haue sent backe the Garrison safe into their Country. It is a
Custome which enemies obserue daily by a Common Law. But to the
end they might with more ease shewe their affection to <hi>Cleomenes</hi> and
the <hi>Lacedemo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ians,</hi> there proceeded to this great cruelty and basenesse,
who in breaking the Law of Nations would not spare their Friends.
Seeing then they haue practised such great cruelty towards those, who
hauing lately taken their Towne, intreated them like men without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and now defended and kept their Towne, of what paines shall
wee iudge them worthy? VVhat punishment may wee ordayne for so
foule an outrage? Shall they be sold with their wiues and Children?
But by the Law of Armes they may doe it to those, which haue not
committed such crimes nor such cruelties. They were therefore wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:16537:55"/>
of a greater punishment, and a more grieuous example. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if they haue suffered no more but that which <hi>Philarchus</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
we must beleeue that the <hi>Grecians</hi> were not mooued to pitty, but
rather commended the iudgement of the <hi>Acheins;</hi> who had resolued
that so great a cruelty (the like whereof had neuer beene spoken of)
should be grieuously punished.</p>
            <p>Seeing then the <hi>Mantiniens</hi> at that time had no other harme,<note place="margin">The <hi>Mantini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens</hi> sold.</note> but
the losse of their goods, and were sold by their enemies, who will
not hold this Historiographer to be a lyer, and moreouer to haue
Written incredible things: And to the end he might shew his ignorance,
he hath not obserued that the <hi>Acheins</hi> at the same time did not the like
vnto the <hi>Tegeates,</hi> whom they tooke in battell: For if the cruelty of
the <hi>Acheins</hi> had beene the cause thereof, there is no doubt but the
<hi>Tegeates</hi> had suffered in like manner. But seeing that this Rigour fell
onely vppon the <hi>Mantiniens,</hi> it is apparent that the cause of their chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
was diuers. Moreouer, this same Historiographer tells vs,<note place="margin">Arist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>macus.</note> that
<hi>Aristomacus</hi> the <hi>Argine,</hi> of a noble Family, and of an auncient Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall
Race, was Tyrant of <hi>Argos,</hi> who being taken by <hi>Antigonus</hi>
and the <hi>Acheins,</hi> and brought to <hi>Cenchrea,</hi> hee suffered the most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust
Death that euer man indured.</p>
            <p>He makes him moreouer (as it is his custome) to cast out lamentable
cries, the night that he was strangled: And that the neighbours terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
partly with the cruelty, and partly desirous to know what it was,
some of them wonderfully incensed ranne thither. He also sets downe
other effeminate things, which we will leaue for the present, beeing
content with that which we haue here related. For my part I conceiue
that if <hi>Aristomacus</hi> had done no other thing against the <hi>Acheins,</hi> but
to turne the Common-weale into ruine, and the liberty of the Country
into Tyranny, that he hath worthily deserued very great punishment.
Although that this gentle Historiographer desirous to attribute great
glory vnto him, and to begge pitty from the Auditors, by a comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration
of the paines which he indured, he doth not once say, that
he was a Tyrant, but that hee was descended of a Tyrannicall Race.
What could he say worse, or more pernitious? For the very name
is the field where all cruelty is sowne, and which imbraceth all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
and villanies of men. And admit that <hi>Aristomacus</hi> had indured
great torments, as <hi>Philarchus</hi> sayth, yet he was not sufficiently puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
for that which he committed in one day: for when as <hi>Arate</hi> entred
into <hi>Argos</hi> with a Troupe of <hi>Acheins,</hi> without Discouery, labouring
to restore the <hi>Argiues</hi> to their liberty, hee was in the end forced to
leaue the Towne, for that hee found not any man would take Armes,
for the feare they had of this Tyrant.</p>
            <p>Wherefore <hi>Aristomacus</hi> taking his occasion (for that they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to the comming of the <hi>Acheins</hi>) put to Death fourescore Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens<note place="margin">The cruelty of <hi>Aristomacus.</hi>
               </note>
in the presence of his familiars. Beleeue me it will bee tedious to
relate the cruelty which he committed in his life time: He held it of his
Predecessors by right of inheritance. And therefore wee must not
thinke they haue done him wrong, if they haue made him serue for an
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:16537:55"/>
example with torments: For it would haue beene much more vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
that so wicked a man after the murther of so many, and after<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
many thefts and spoyles, should haue died vnpunished like an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.
Neither can they charge <hi>Antigonus</hi> nor <hi>Arate</hi> of cruelty, to
haue put a Tyrant to death in Prison, whom they had taken in open
Warre, and whom they might with reason and honour haue taken du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a peace, and haue put him to a cruell death. But of what punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will not you hold him worthy, who besides all these things brake
his accord with the <hi>Acheins.</hi> A little before hee had relinquisht the
tyranny, being destitute of all hope and succours after the death of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius.</hi>
At what time the <hi>Acheins</hi> did not onely saue him, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
him so courteously and graciously, as they remitted all the
wrongs which hee had done during his Reigne, and gaue him great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancements
in their Common-wealth. Finally, they made him Chiefe
of the <hi>Acheins.</hi> But this wicked man amongst all others, forgetting
that great humanity and clemency, began presently to plot how hee
might make a league with <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> retiring himselfe in that greatest
neede soone after to the Enemy: whereby the <hi>Acheins</hi> were in great
danger. Who some few dayes after was taken in Warre, was he not
worthy to dye in the Night in the Prison at <hi>Cenchrea,</hi> as <hi>Philarchus</hi>
saith,<note place="margin">Aristo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi>
               </note> but hee should rather haue beene carried throughout all <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and after that he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> had suffered infinite torments, to haue dyed cruelly.
Yet hee was onely strangled in Prison, although hee had committed
all sorts of Villany.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, the same Historiographer holds a long discourse of the
miseries of the <hi>Mantiniens,</hi> as if hee thought it were the duty of an
Historiographer onely to relate cruell and vniust actions. In regard
of the virtue and magnanimity of the <hi>Megalopolitains,</hi> which they
shewed at that time, he makes no mention, as if the duty of an Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
were rather to remember the wickednesse and vices of men, than
things well and commendably done: Whereas the Readers of Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
shall reape more profit by deeds which are worthy to bee imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and followed, than those which are vniust, and to bee auoided.
Moreouer hee pursues his Discourse, how that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> tooke the
Citty, and that hee sent Letters to <hi>Messena</hi> to the <hi>Megalopolitains,</hi>
aduising them to returne into their Countrey which was whole, and
to be of his party: And how the <hi>Megalopolitains</hi> could not endure they
should finish the reading of the Letters, and could hardly forbeare from
doing outrage to the messenger, with many other petty triuiall things,
to shew the magnificence and modesty of <hi>Cleomenes</hi> towards his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
But he forbeares to tell that which followed, and which was
very proper to the History, which is the praise and memory of things
well done. But who hindred him? If we hold them honest men who
in words and will maintaine a Warre for their Allies, and if wee doe
not onely praise with admiration, but also giue thankes with Presents,
to those that endure the spoile of their Countrey with fire and sieges,<note place="margin">The great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

what commendations shall we giue then to the <hi>Megalopolitains?</hi> what
affection shall wee beare vnto them? Shall it not be great and ample?
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:16537:56"/>
First, they left the Prouince to <hi>Clomenes,</hi> and abandoned their owne
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ountrey, rather than to breake their Faith with the <hi>Acheins.</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
although that contrary to hope, and the opinion of all the world,
they might haue returned into their Country with safety, yet they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
rather to be banished, forsaking their houses, Sepulchers, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and goods, and finally, all their estates, than to be taxed to haue
broken their Faith with their Allies. Was there euer any thing done
that was more rare and excellent? Whereunto then should an Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ographer
make his Auditours more attentiue? With what examples
could hee better exhort men to keepe their Faith, and to follow things
well done. But <hi>Philarchus</hi> makes no mention hereof, and is in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
blind, when as braue exploits which are worthy of memory
offer themselues.</p>
            <p>Hee saith moreouer,<note place="margin">The third part of the booty is due to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</note> that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> made a spoile within
<hi>Megalopolis</hi> of three Millions, and sixe hundred thousand Crownes,
whereof <hi>Cleomenes</hi> according to the custome had twelue hundred
thousand. But who will not maruaile at the beastlinesse and ignorance
of this man, touching the Riches and power of <hi>Greece:</hi> the which
are things which an Historiographer ought to know. Truely, I dare
boldly affirme, that they could not gather together this Summe in all
<hi>Morea,</hi> out of the money of all their moueables, excepting their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
I meane not in the time when it was impouerished by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of the Kings of <hi>Macedony,</hi> and by the diuers Warres which
they had amongst themselues, but at such time when as all the Townes
were firmely vnited together, and when as Fortune seemed to smile on
them. But to shew that what wee say, proceeds not from ouer-wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or want of reason, it appeares thus. Who knowes not that when
the <hi>Acheins</hi> ioyned to the <hi>Thebeins,</hi> made Warre against the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians,</hi>
and that they were to raise an Army of ten thousand men,
and another at Sea of an hundred Triremes, and that they had calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
the charge, it not onely emptied their publicke Cofers, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
their houses and the whole Prouince: and that finally, they could
hardly draw together three Millions, and sixe hundred thousand
Crownes, whereof there wanted an hundred and fifty thousand.</p>
            <p>You must not hold that strange which I now affirme of <hi>Morea.</hi>
There is not any man that dare assure, that the spoile of <hi>Megalopolis</hi> at
that time, did amount to aboue ninescore thousand Crownes: and
that the people, as well Burgesses as Slaues retired to <hi>Messina.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
behold a great argument: For when the <hi>Mantineans</hi> were not lesse
strong, nor of meaner estate than the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> as this Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
sayth, were enuironed by a siege, so as when they yeelded, no
man could steale away, nor carry away any thing: Yet the whole
spoile,<note place="margin">The pillage of <hi>Mantinia</hi> came to ninescore thousand Crownes.</note> reckoning it at the vttermost, accompting the bodies, was estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
but ninescore thousand Crownes. Moreouer, who will not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at that which hee saith afterwards, that an Embassie from <hi>Ptolomy</hi>
came ten dayes before this battell, to let <hi>Cleomenes</hi> vnderstand that he
was not resolued to contribute any longer to the charges of this Warre,
and that hee aduised him to agree with <hi>Antigonus?</hi> The which <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:16537:56"/>
hearing, he resolued to hazard the battell, before his Souldiers
should heare the newes, lest they should mutine, when they should
be out of hope of their pay. But if it were true, that he had lately
gotten three Millions, and sixe hundred thousand Crownes in <hi>Mega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopolis,</hi>
what neede hath he of <hi>Ptolomyes</hi> contribution, seeing that
ninescore thousand Crownes were more then sufficient to defeate <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi>
forces? Is it not a great weakenesse in him to say, that <hi>Cleoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>

soone as the opportunity of the time would giue him leaue. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
preached vnto his men, he entred into the Countrey of <hi>Argos.</hi>
Many blamed him for this attempt, as being too bold and rash,
in regard of the scituation of the Countrey, which is difficult and
strong by Nature. Others which were of a better Iudgement,
held it wisely done. For when as he saw that <hi>Antigonus</hi> had left
the greatest part of his Army in the Countrey, and had with him
but a small handfull of Mercenary Souldiers, he had a conceit, that
hee might easily enter the Prouince without danger: And if he put
all vnto fire and Sword, euen vnto the Walles of the Citty,
the <hi>Argiues</hi> through necessity would charge <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
his basenesse must endure such outrages. Finally, if hee be
forced to come to fight, moued with the cries of the people, who
shall hinder him to haue the Victory, seeing he hath a greater Troupe
of men? If he doth not abandon the Citty as it is fitting, hee can
carry backe his men without danger into his Countrey, after
that he hath ouer-runne the Champion: Leauing a great amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and terrour to his Enemies, and assuring the hearts of his
owne Souldiers.<note place="margin">Antigonus <hi>blamed.</hi>
               </note> The which succeeded according to his proiect.
For when the people saw the whole Prouince thus spoyled, they
began to blame <hi>Antigonus:</hi> who notwithstanding discharging the
Duty of a wise and discreet Captaine, would not goe to field. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omenes</hi>
in the meane time ouer-ran their whole Countrey without

that hee had at pleasure ruined the Prouince, and left a great amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

<hi>Sclanonians,</hi> whereof <hi>Demetrius</hi> of <hi>Phare</hi> was Captaine. Thus
the whole Army consisted of twenty eight thousand Foote, and
twelue hundred Horse. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> being aduertised by his Spies of
the Enemies descent, hee placed forces vpon the passages, by the
which they might enter into his Countrey, fortifying them with
Trenches and Trees cut downe: And hee himselfe went with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

the Enemy would take that way.<note place="margin">Sellasia.</note> His Army was about twenty

in the Plaine, with some of the Mercenaries, vpon the two Bankes of
the Riuer.</p>
            <p>When as <hi>Antigonus</hi> was come into those places, and finding the
scituation of them, and the wonderfull industry of <hi>Cleomenes</hi> to dispose
of his Army, hee was not resolued to fight at that time. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee camped neere vnto him, vpon the banke of the Riuer of <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gile:</hi>
whereas staying some dayes,<note place="margin">

               </note> hee turned about the Countrey
and the Enemies Campe and sought to draw them to battell by skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes.
But when hee found nothing without defence, for that the
Prouidence of <hi>Cleomenes</hi> had carefully rampired all places, hee gaue
ouer his enterprize: But in the end they resolued by a common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
to make an end of their Warre by a battell. Behold how For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
had drawne together two great Captaines, equall in virtue,

            </p>
            <p>After these marcht the <hi>Acarnanians</hi> and they of <hi>Candy:</hi> Finally,
he placed two thousand <hi>Acheins</hi> for a supply, to succour them at
need. Then he set his Horse-men neere vnto the Riuer-side in Front
of the Enemies Horse, whereof <hi>Alexander</hi> had the charge with two
thousand Foote-men. As for <hi>Antigonus,</hi> hee lodged neere vnto
Mount <hi>Olympus</hi> with the bands of Aduenturers, and the <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi>
where hee resolued to fight with <hi>Cleomenes.</hi> VVhen hee had

suffer them to doe otherwise. They had giuen charge to the <hi>Sctauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
to begin the battell, as soone as they should see a white cloth,
which should be aduanced neere vnto Mount <hi>Olimpus,</hi> at the foote
whereof they lodged at Night, vnder the Riuer of <hi>Gorgile.</hi> The <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galopolitains</hi>
also with the Horse-men were to enter the combate, as
soone as they should see a purple Robe, aduanced in the Aire from the
Kings Quarter.</p>
            <p>The houre of the battell was now come, the <hi>Sclauonians</hi> had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
discouered <hi>Antigonus</hi> signe. They encourage their Companions
according to the opportunity of the time, making no doubt but they
had the victory in their hands. Then they endeauoured with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
resolution to gaine the Mountaine. But the Foote-men which
were lightly armed, whom <hi>Cleomenes</hi> as wee haue sayd, left in the
Plaine with the Horse-men, seeing that the Bands of the <hi>Acheins</hi> had
not the courage to second them, charg'd them vpon the Reare, so as
they were in great danger: For on the right hand, and in Front <hi>Eucli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi>
had the better with his men: and the Mercenaries on the left
hand, fighting obstinately, made a great spoile vpon the Reare. By
this meanes they were suddainly enuironed with two Troopes of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
When <hi>Philopomene</hi> the <hi>Megalopolitaine</hi> saw this disorder, hee
suddainly gaue good aduice to the Captaines. But for that hee was
a young man, and had neuer had charge they gaue no eare vnto
him. Wherefore addressing himselfe to those of his Nation, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
sayth hee, the Victory is ours if you will follow mee. And
in charging the Enemies Horse, they assailed them with great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.
Wherefore the Aduenturers strangers, who fought in the
Reare of those which assail'd the Mountaine, hearing a great noise,
and seeing the Combate of the Horse-men, retired to aide and succour
them, whereunto they had beene at the first ordained.</p>
            <p>The order of the Enemies being by this meanes broken, the <hi>Scla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uonians</hi>
and <hi>Macedonians</hi> with others whom <hi>Antigonus</hi> had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
fell vpon them with great violence and fury. So as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
all the World was of opinion,<note place="margin">The courage of <hi>Philopomene</hi> is the cause of the Victory.</note> that the industry and courage
of <hi>Philopomene</hi> had defeated <hi>Euclide</hi> at that time. And therefore
they say, that when as <hi>Antigonus</hi> demaunded of <hi>Alexander</hi> why hee
had sent the Horse-men against the Enemy, before hee had seene
the signe, and that hee had answered, it was not hee, but a young
<hi>Megalopolitaine</hi> which had done it without his priuity, hee then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
that this young man had performed the duty of a good Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
and <hi>Alexander</hi> that of a young foole.</p>
            <p>But they which kept the toppe of the Mountaine with <hi>Euceli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi>
shewed their basenesse, seeing the Enemies ascend: for they
should not haue attended vntill they had gain'd the top with safety:
But relying vpon the aduantage of the place, they should haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
them, and charged them from aboue: and if necessity
had required, they might haue retired safely on the right hand, to
charge the Enemy againe. In doing this they had easily broken, defeated
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:16537:58"/>
and put the <hi>Macedonians</hi> to flight. But they did the contrary, as if
they had the Victory certaine in their hands; for without moouing
from the place which the <hi>Cleomenes</hi> had appointed them, they staied
expecting the enemy, with hope of a greater defeate: For that they
should be repulsed and beaten from the highest place of the Mountaine.
But they soone suffered the pennance of their basenesse. For after that
the <hi>Macedonians</hi> had recouered the Mountaine, without any resistance,
and were come into the Plaine, they fell vpon their enemies, fighting
hand to hand with so great sury, as they presently draue them backe
into the hollow Caues and inaccessible places.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the Combate was cruell among the Horse-men,
where it was worth the sight, to behold with what heate, force, and
courage the <hi>Acheins</hi> fought, considering they all fought for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the Countrey.<note place="margin">Philopomene.</note> But among all others they made great esteeme
of <hi>Philopomene;</hi> for when his Horse was ouer thrown with a <hi>Pertuisane</hi>
he fainted not, fighting long on foote with great courage. Finally in
the end hee died valliantly, being shot thorough the shinne-bones with
an Arrow. On the other side the Kings had begunne the fight at
Mount <hi>Olympus</hi> with the mercenaries and such as were lightly armed.
They were about fiue thousand men, who fought sometimes man to
man, and sometimes they tried the Fortune of the whole Troupe.
There the Victory was long in suspence, finally they parted equally from
the battell.</p>
            <p>But when as <hi>Cleomees</hi> was aduertised that <hi>Emlide</hi> had abandoned the
Mountaine, and that the Allies had turned head, and that the Horse-men
were in great despaire, and that all trembled for feare, hee resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to goe out of his Fort, and to put his whole Army in Front vpon
one side of the Campe; and therefore hee caused them to sound a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate.
By this meanes when those that were lightly armed were
drawne together, the two Armies charged with their Pikes and Iaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.
The Combate was cruell, and the charge performed with so
great courage on either side, as the Victory was long doubtfull, and
the iudgement difficult who deserued the greatest honour: For that
sometimes the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> retired, and againe they made the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> when as the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were vanquished and put to

himselfe in <hi>Sparta</hi> without any wound, beeing accompanied by some
of the Horse-men. From thence hee retired the night following to

When as <hi>Antigonus</hi> was entred into <hi>Lacedemon</hi> finding no

in all things; but especially in suffering them to liue and gouerne their

made. Behold how Fortune disposeth of great affaires as she pleaseth.

There is no doubt but if <hi>Cleomenes</hi> had deferred the battell a little, or

of liuing of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> of their Lawes and of their Common-weale:
By the which as proper to them,<note place="margin">The Countries conquered by the <hi>Romanes.</hi>
               </note> they haue attained vnto such great
power, as they haue not only made subiect to their obedience, <hi>Italy,
Sycile,</hi> and the <hi>Gaules,</hi> and likewise <hi>Spaine</hi> in a short time; but in the
end they haue vndertaken the Empire of the whole World, after they
had vanquished the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> by Armes.<note place="margin">Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

shew, how the Kingdome of <hi>Hieron</hi> of <hi>Saragosse</hi> was defeated and rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

<hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Phenicea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when as we haue summarily set downe the affaires of <hi>Spaine,
Lybia,</hi> and <hi>Sycile,</hi> we will presently turne our Discourse to <hi>Greece,</hi> as
the affaires shall change. For after that we haue related the VVars at
Sea,<note place="margin">Attalus.</note> which <hi>Attalus</hi> and the <hi>Rhodiens</hi> made against <hi>Philip:</hi> and hauing
set downe the <hi>Romanes</hi> VVarre against him, how and by whom it had
beene mannaged, and what successe it had, obseruing the order of
things, we will come to the indignation of the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> who proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
VVarre against the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and drew <hi>Antiochus</hi> out of <hi>Asia.</hi>
And when we haue deliuered the causes, and related <hi>Antiochus</hi> naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
into <hi>Europe,</hi> we will first shew how he fled out of <hi>Greece;</hi> and
being vanquished by Armes, how he abandoned vnto the <hi>Romanes,</hi> all

               <note place="margin">Mount <hi>Taurus</hi>
               </note> Thirdly, we will
shew with what power the <hi>Romans</hi> conquered the Empire of <hi>Asia,</hi> after
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:16537:60"/>
they had wholy defeated the <hi>Gaules,</hi> who wandred vp and downe;
and how they freed the whole Countrey on this side Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi>
from the feare of the <hi>Barbarians;</hi> and the insolency of the <hi>Gaules.</hi> And
when we haue related the mis-fortune of the <hi>Etoliens</hi> and <hi>Cophalins</hi> in
their Warres,<note place="margin">Eumenides. Ariarate. Morea.</note> we will make mention of those of <hi>Eumenides,</hi> of <hi>Prshia,</hi>
and of the <hi>Gaules;</hi> the like we will do of that of <hi>Ariarate</hi> against <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace.</hi>
From thence dispatching the accords of them of <hi>Morea,</hi> and the
increase of the <hi>Rhodien</hi> Common-wealth, we will make an end of our
worke, setting downe in the end the Voyages which <hi>Antiochus</hi> sirna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Epiphanes,</hi> made into <hi>Aegypt.</hi> And in like manner the Warres of

               </hi> with the ruine of the Kingdome of the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> These are
things whereby we may easily vnderstand how the <hi>Romanes</hi> in a short
submitted the whole Earth vnder their obedience, assailing them in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.
And if it were lawfull to discerne vertue from vice, by the good
or bad successe of affaires,<note place="margin">The Conquest of the <hi>Romanes</hi> in 53. yeares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> or from the praise or dishonour of men, we
must of necessity make an end here, and turne our Relation to things
which in the beginning we propounded to set down; for this hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
fifty three yeares: during the which the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
so great an increase, as the whole World might well know, that they
must do what their people commaunded. But for that such things,
cannot be rightly iudged by the good Fortune of affaires, considering
that many times those that seeme to be well done, are the cause of great
inconueniencies, if they be not done in time: And contrary-wise they
which are fallen into some disaster, many times turne their mis-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
to good, if they know how to haue patience. We haue thought
it fitting to adde to that which we haue Written, what the nature of
the Victors were, what meanes they held in the gouernment of their
Empire, and how the rest of the Townes, Regions, and Countries
yeilded willingly vnto them? And moreouer what course of life, and
what Lawes they held with all the World, aswell in particular as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
with all their Common-wealths.</p>
            <p>By this meanes they which liue at this day, shall plainy see, whither
it be good to flie, or voluntarily to submit to the Empire of <hi>Rome;</hi> and
they which shall come after may iudge whither the actions of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi>
be commendable and worthy of memory, or altogether blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
Behold, wherein the profit of our History will consist, aswell
for the present as the future time. They which mannage a Warre, and
they which vndertake to iudge of it, do not propound the Victory for
the last end, nor wholy to subiect himselfe. Beleeue me, a wise man
doth not make Warre with his neighbours, to see the defeat and ruine:
Neither doth any man saile in diuers Seas, onely to make Voyages;
nor pursues many Sciences and Disciplines, in regard onely of them.
Without doubt we pursue these things, for that which followes, seemes
pleasant, profitable, or decent, and therefore wee may with reason
say, that the end of our Worke hath beene to know the condition of
all things, after the Conquest of the World made by the <hi>Romanes,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
they fell againe into new combustions.</p>
            <p>Of which troubles I haue resolued to write, making as it were, a new

found among so great a multitude of wise and learned men, that
would finish our Worke, and endeuour to bring vnto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
that, which suddaine Death might hinder and preuent
in vs.</p>
            <p>As wee haue related at large the deeds which seeme most memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
desiring that our whole worke might bee knowne to the
Reader, as well in generall as perticular, it is now time vnto the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of our designe. The greatest part of those which haue
written the deeds of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> desiring to shew the cause of the
Warre which kindled betwixt the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
say, that the siege of <hi>Sagonte</hi> was the first: and the second, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the accord made with the <hi>Romans,</hi> they had past the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
of <hi>Ebro.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For my part, I am of opinion that these were the beginnings, but
not the causes; for there is a great difference betwixt the causes and
beginning of things:<note place="margin">The beginning of a worke and the cause <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> vnlesse some will say, that the Voyage of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
the great into <hi>Asia,</hi> hath beene the cause of the Warre which
he made against the <hi>Persians:</hi> Or that the descent which <hi>Antiochus</hi>
made at <hi>Demetriade,</hi> hath beene the cause of that which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
against the <hi>Romans:</hi> the which is neither true nor likely.</p>
            <p>But what man is so much blinded with ignorance, that will
affirme and maintaine, that the preparations which were made part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by <hi>Alexander,</hi> and partly by <hi>Phillip</hi> in his life time, for the Warre
of <hi>Persia:</hi> Or by the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> to make Warre against the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
before the comming of <hi>Antiochus</hi> hath beene the causes of the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:16537:61"/>
Warre? These are the opinions of men, who doe not obserue how
much the beginnings and the cause differ: and that the causes in all
things are the first, and the beginning are the end of causes. I am of
opinion that the beginnings are called the first workes of things which
are resolued and concluded, and that the causes are those which
preceed the decree and resolution, and makes vs so to iudge: as are
the thoughts, the aduices, the discourses of reason and such other
things.</p>
            <p>This will be apparent for that which followes: For it will be easie
for any man to see for what cause the Warre of <hi>Persia</hi> was made,<note place="margin">The eauses of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Warre in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia.</hi>
               </note> and
whence the beginning came. The first was the returne of the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
with <hi>Xenophon</hi> into their Countrey, by infinite fierce and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Nations: where not any one durst make head against him in so
long a Voyage.</p>
            <p>The second hath beene the Voyage of <hi>Agesilaus</hi> King of <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monia</hi>
into <hi>Asia</hi> by Sea.<note place="margin">Agesilaus.</note> Where hauing found nothing answerable
to his forces, nor that presented it selfe, hee was forced to returne
into <hi>Greece,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phillip.</note> for the troubles which were kindled there: as if he had
triumphed ouer the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> For which causes <hi>Phillip</hi> King of
<hi>Macedon,</hi> hauing experience of the basenesse and sloth of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi>
and relying vpon the readinesse of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> in matters of
War: being likewise drawne with the hope of great gaine he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
Warre against them with all his forces, as soone as he found
himselfe assured of the amity and friendship of the <hi>Grecians:</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his occasion, that the <hi>Persians</hi> had vsed great cruelty against
them.</p>
            <p>And therefore wee must say, that the causes of this Warre are
those which wee haue first related, and the occasions are those where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we now speake: and the beginning was <hi>Alexanders</hi> Voiage by
Sea into <hi>Asia:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The cause of the <hi>Etoliens</hi> Warre against the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </note> And in that which was made against the <hi>Romans</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the conduct of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> the wrath and indignation of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toliens</hi>
was the cause. You must vnderstand that for the opinion
which they had conceiued, that the <hi>Romans</hi> made no accompt of
them as long as the Warre of <hi>Phillip</hi> continued, they not onely
called <hi>Antiochus</hi> vnto their Succours, but also resolued to put all
in hazard, so great their spleene and fury was for that which
was past.</p>
            <p>It is true, the liberty of <hi>Greece</hi> was the occasion, vnder hope
whereof they laboured by all meanes to draw the neighbour Citties
to their Enterprize: But the beginning of the Warre was the Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
to Sea of <hi>Antiochus</hi> to <hi>Demetriade.</hi> Wee haue beene tedious
in this Discourse, not to blame any one of the auncient Historio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers,
but for the profit of those which haue a desire to learne.
For as Phisitians cannot cure their Patients,<note place="margin">A good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison.</note> if they haue not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the causes of the Diseases wherewith they are troubled: So
they which treate of Histories, are altogether vnprofitable, if the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the place, of the time, with the causes and occasions bee not
knowne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:16537:61"/>
There is therefore nothing more necessary, nor more to be desired, than
to know the causes of all things that happen: For opportunity doth
many times rectifie great affaires, and it is easie to preuent their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings.</p>
            <p>It is true that <hi>Fabius</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Historiographer faith,<note place="margin">Fabius.</note> that the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
and inhumanity of <hi>Hannibal</hi> towards the <hi>Sagontins,</hi> and the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
and insatiable desire of Rule in <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> haue beene the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the Warre betwixt the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Hannibal,</hi> Generall of the
<hi>Carthaginians.</hi> Then hee sayth that he had much augmented the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> Empire in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and that being returned to <hi>Carthage,</hi>
hee sought to tirannize the Common-wealth, and to ouerthrow their
Lawes. The which the chiefe men discouering, they opposed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
against <hi>Asdrubal.</hi> Wherefore leauing <hi>Affricke</hi> in a rage, hee
returned presently into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and afterwards mannaged the affaires
according to his owne fancy, and without the authority of the Senate
of <hi>Carthage.</hi> Moreouer, he saith, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> who from his youth
had beene at the Warre vnder him, was of the same enterprize: and
therefore after he was Lord of <hi>Spaine,</hi> hee followed the courses of
<hi>Asdrubal.</hi> So as this Warre which was made against the <hi>Romans,</hi>
was begun by him in spight of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and that there was
not any man in <hi>Carthage</hi> which loued the Common-wealth, but
did much blame the deeds of <hi>Hannibal</hi> against the <hi>Sagontins.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
hee sayth, that after the taking of <hi>Sagont,</hi> there was an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassie
sent from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Carthage,</hi> demaunding <hi>Hannibal</hi> to bee pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
for the breach of the accord, and if they would not yeeld vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, they should declare Warre against the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if a man should demaund of <hi>Fabius</hi> what could succeed bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
nor more reasonable, and expedient for the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> than
to deliuer vpon the <hi>Romans</hi> request the authour of the offence, and
him that had committed the fault, to punish him: Seeing that as hee
sayth, they had dislik't the actions of <hi>Hannibal:</hi> and by this meanes
might reuenge by another the common Enemy of the Countrey, and
maintaine the estate of their Citty in peace, chasing away the authour
of the warre, considering that this might bee well effected by a bare
resolution? What can he answere? Nothing without doubt. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise
they were so farre from doing it,<note place="margin">The Warre of <hi>Hannibal</hi> continued 17. yeeres.</note> as they maintained the
Warre seuenteene yeeres continuall against the <hi>Romans:</hi> Neither did
they cease vntill destitute of all hope, they not onely hazarded their
Countrey, but also their liues.</p>
            <p>Finally, to what end doe wee vse this discourse of <hi>Fabius</hi> or of his
writings? It is not to cry him downe: For his lying writings are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
to those which reade them. It is onely to aduertise those which
giue the credit, not somuch to regard the title of the Authour, as
the truth of things: For there are men which doe not beare so much
respect to the writings, as to him that made them, and which thinke
that for as much as <hi>Fabius</hi> liued in those times, and had beene
of the Senate, that hee could not but speake truth. It is true,
and I am of opinion, that we must giue beleefe and credit vnto him in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:16537:62"/>
many things, but yet wee may not beleeue all: for wee must consider
things as they are, and how they agree.</p>
            <p>Finally, to returne to our Discourse, we must not thinke that the first
cause of the Warre,<note place="margin">The first cause of the Warre betwixt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>
               </note> which the <hi>Romans</hi> had with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> was
the indignation of <hi>Amilcar,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Barca,</hi> Father to <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
And we must vnderstand that he was not vanquished by the <hi>Romans,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Warre of <hi>Sicily;</hi> (for he preserued the Army which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Erix</hi> with great Iudgement) but when he saw the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
had lost the battell at Sea,<note place="margin">The fore sight of <hi>Amilcar,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal.</hi>
               </note> hee thought good to veeld vnto the time,
and made a peace with the <hi>Romans,</hi> yet hee left no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> his indignation,
so as he expected continually an opportunity to be reuenged of them.
And if the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had not found themselues troubled with the
mntiny of their Souldiers, hee would presently haue renewed the
VVarre with all his power: and therefore being hindred by an intestine
mischiefe, he deserr'd it to another time.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> considering the danger wherein the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were
by the mutiny of their Souldiers, threatned them with VVarre. To
preuent the which, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> made an accord as we haue spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
in the former Booke, without which no man can vnderstand
that which wee haue now sayd,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sardinia</hi> aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>
               </note> nor that which followes. Finally, they
quit them <hi>Sardinia,</hi> as vnfurnished both of counsell and aide: For
that the <hi>Romans</hi> would not otherwise desist from their Enterprize, and
they payed them beside the Summe already accorded, seuen hundred
thousand Crownes: which was the second and the greatest cause of the
VVarre which after wards began.<note place="margin">The second Cause.</note>
            </p>
            <p>VVhen as all the people of <hi>Carthage</hi> were entred into the like indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and that <hi>Amilcar</hi> saw the mutiny of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
supprest, and the affaires of the Countrey pacified, he began to
make VVarre in <hi>Spaine,</hi> seeking to make vse of it, as a preparatiue to
leade them against the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The third Cause.</note> Behold that which we must imagine

<hi>Amilcar</hi> was the principall cause of the second <hi>Punique</hi> VVarre, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he were dead ten yeeres before: but it shall suffice for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to relate that which followeth: At what time that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was
vanquished by the <hi>Romans,</hi> he retired to <hi>Antiochus</hi> leauing <hi>Affricke,</hi>
the <hi>Romans</hi> aduertised of the <hi>Etoliens</hi> attempt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Antiochu</hi> san Enemy to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </note> sent an Embassie to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi>
to know his will, and to discouer by this meanes his preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for Warre. But hauing vnderstood that he held the party of the
<hi>Etoliens,</hi> and that he was resolued to make Warre against the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
they frequented daily with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> seeking by their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
familiarity, to draw him into suspition and dislike; wherein they
were not deceiued: For <hi>Antiochus</hi> thinking he had beene gain'd by
the <hi>Romans,</hi> suspected him long. But it happened on a time when
as the King called him to his Councell, whereas he had good liberty to
speake. And then after many discourses, in the end as it were by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
hee began to vse these termes. VVhen as my Father
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:16537:62"/>
               <hi>Amilcar</hi> was to passe into <hi>Spaine</hi> with an Army I was about the Age
of nine yeares: and when as he sacrificed to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> I was neere vnto
the Altars.</p>
            <p>But when as the Sacrifices were ended,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> his speech to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus.</hi>
               </note> my father caused the rest to
retire backe; and hauing called me alone, he demaunded kindly of me,
and as it were with imbracings, if I would go the Voyage. The which
when I had not onely accepted, but moreouer intreated him like a
childe; then taking my right hand, and laying it vpon the Altar, hee
would that touching the things sacrificed, I should sweare that present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when I came to age, I should be an enemy to the <hi>Romanes.</hi> And
therefore Sir, as long as you shall be their enemy, you may relie confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
in me,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hanibal</hi> swears that when hee came to age, he would be an enemy to the <hi>Romanes.</hi>
               </note> and haue no suspicion of <hi>Hannibal:</hi> but when you shall
be reconciled, or that you shall contract friendshippe with them, then
expect no other accuser, and haue a care to keepe your selfe from me,
as from an enemy to the people of <hi>Rome;</hi> for I shall be alwayes oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
vnto them with all my power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antiochus</hi> hearing this kind of Speech, and that <hi>Hannibal</hi> spake tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and with affection, in regard of his griefe, he presently abandoned
all suspition.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Asdrubal</hi> sonne in Law to <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal.</hi>
               </note> Behold then a manifest testimony of the harred and bad
affection of <hi>Amilcar</hi> towards the <hi>Romanes;</hi> for hee left <hi>Asdrubal</hi> his
sonne in Law, and his sonne <hi>Hannibal</hi> for their enemies, such as there
could be none greater. It is true, that Death tooke an order that <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubal</hi>
could not shewe the hatred he bare them. But <hi>Hannibal</hi> had
time at will, so as preuailing in his interprize, he hath sufficiently made
knowne the hatred which he held from his Father.<note place="margin">A good consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and necessary for al Gouernours.</note> And therefore they
which haue the Gouernment of a Common-weale must carefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
this, and ruminate in their vnderstanding to know the humours of
those, with whom they make any accord or friendship; whither it be
for the necessity of the time, or to giue ouer the Warres; to the ende
they may alwaies defend themselues from those which seeke an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to do euill, and to make vse of those whom they know to bee
their Subiects or true friends, when necessity shall require. These cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
which we haue specified, are those of the second Punique Warre,
and the beginning of that which we will now relate.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> hardly induring the losse of <hi>Sycile,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The causes of the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> hatred.</note> which
the <hi>Romanes</hi> had taken from them. It is true that as we haue said, <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia</hi>
which they had surprized by Treason during the mutiny of <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke,</hi>
and this summe of money which they had caused them to pay,
did much increase their hatred. And therefore it was likely that as soone
as they should grow great in <hi>Spaine,</hi> they would transport the VVarre
into <hi>Italy.</hi> But after the death of <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> who after the death of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcar</hi>
was Generall of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Neuer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunder did any thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily which was not pleasing to the Souldiers.</note> they desired to know the
will of the Souldiers, before they would place a new Commaunder.
And when as the newes came from the Campe, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> had bin
chosen Captaine by a generall consent, they presently assembled, and
confirmed with one accord by the election of the men of VVar. <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
hauing receiued all power, and considering that to linger was of
no worth, he marcht with his army to the skirts of the <hi>Olcades</hi> to ruine
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:16537:63"/>
them. And therefore he besieged <hi>Carteia,</hi> the chiefe Towne of that
Countrey,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Carteia</hi> taken by assault.</note> and tooke it by assault after some dayes resistance. So as
the other Townes being terrified yeelded of themselues to the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this Victory the Army retired to winter at <hi>Carthagena</hi> with
great booty: whereas <hi>Hannibal</hi> vsing great bounty, deuided it amongst
the Souldiers: So as hee gained their hearts wonderfully, leauing
them in great hope for the future. In the Spring hee led his Army a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Vacceens,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Countries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal.</hi>
               </note> and presently conquered <hi>Ermandique:</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
hee tooke <hi>Arbacale</hi> by force, not without great danger, hauing
held it long besieged: For that it had beene well defended by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Citty, and the multitude and courage of the Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>After this, hee suddainly fell by chance into a maruellous danger, by
a charge which the <hi>Toletains</hi> haue him,<note place="margin">The <hi>Toletains.</hi>
               </note> at his returne from the <hi>Vac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceens</hi>

of this Prouince in courage and multitudes of men, with the which
also there ioyned the Fugitiues of <hi>Ermandique.</hi> Whereunto the
banished men of the <hi>Olcades</hi> had perswaded them. Without doubt the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> had beene vanquished and defeated, if they had offered

               </note> but <hi>Hannibal</hi> gaue order to the contrary, and striking S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

giuing charge vnto his Horse men, that when they should see the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
enter into the Water, they should charge the Battalion of foote.
He lodg'd forty Elephants along the Bankes.</p>
            <p>By this meanes all things succeeded happily, for that he had the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
and the Elephants as it were, for Combattants: For the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
thinking that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were retired for feare, they cast
themselues confusedly into the Riuer with great cries. Wherefore a
great number of them were defeated vpon the Bankes of the Riuer by
the Elephants which stood there,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hanibals</hi> victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vppon the Barbarians.</note> and flew them at their landing. Some
were also sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine in the Riuer by the Horse men, for that the Horsemen
being at ease and without Armour, could better helpe themselues, and
annoy the enemies, who durst not relye vpon the Ford. They which
were in the Reare, and might easily recouer the Banke, retired, vntill
in the end the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> cast themselues into the riuer with all their
bands and companies,<note place="margin">An Army of a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men.</note> and put them to flight. The <hi>Toletains</hi> army,
with the <hi>Olcades</hi> and <hi>Vacceens,</hi> consisted of a hundred thousand men.
After which defeate, there were not any found beyond the riuer of
<hi>Ebro,</hi> that durst resist the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> except the <hi>Sagontins.</hi> It is
true that <hi>Hannibal</hi> would not fall vpon them, least hee should offer an
occasion of Warre to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> before hee had seized vppon that
which his Father <hi>Amilcar</hi> had aduised him to do.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the <hi>Sagontins</hi> sent often to <hi>Rome,</hi> aswell for the
care of their owne priuate affaires,<note place="margin">An Embassie from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> to <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal.</hi>
               </note> as also fore-seeing future things,
and likewise to aduertise them of the good Fortune of the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
in <hi>Spaine.</hi> Finally the <hi>Romanes</hi> hauing thereupon many and diuers
aduertisements, they sent an Embassie into <hi>Spaine,</hi> to discouer the
course of <hi>Hannibals</hi> actions: But he was retired to Winter at <hi>Carthagena,</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:16537:63"/>
hauing mannaged his affaires to his owne liking. Being suddainly arriued
there, he cals them and giues them audience, and power to deliuer
their charge. The Embassadours at the first signifies vnto him, that he
should demaund nothing from the <hi>Sagontins,</hi> being allied vnto the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes:</hi>
And moreouer that he should not passe the riuer of <hi>Ebro,</hi> for
that it had beene so concluded by the Treaty made with <hi>Asdruball.</hi> The
which being heard by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> like a young man and greedy of War,
and who easily did what he would with the Senate of <hi>Carthage,</hi> by
the meanes of the heads of his faction,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibals</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours.</note> together with the hatred he
bare against the <hi>Romanes,</hi> he answered the Embassadours as a friend to
the <hi>Sagontins,</hi> blaming the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> who when they had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
receiued Letters from the <hi>Sagontins,</hi> for a mutiny which was growne
amongst them, to the end they might send some Embassie to pacifie it,
they had wickedly put to death some of the principall of the Citty:
Whereof he threatens them to take reuenge, saying that the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi>
had a Custome not to disdaine outrages: On the other side, he
sent vnto <hi>Carthage,</hi> to aduertise them of that which they were to do,
considering that the <hi>Sagontins</hi> relying vppon the Alliance with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi>
had done great outrages to many Townes subiect to the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally as one full of inconstancy and rage, and inflamed with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to make Warre, he propounded no other valuable reason, pursuing
only certaine friuolous and impertinent causes. The which is incident
to those, who transported by their passion forget their duty. But had
it not beene much better to say thus? That the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> do right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
demaund of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> that they restore vnto them <hi>Sardinia,</hi>
and the siluer, which for so many yeares they had vniustly drawne
from them, during their great affaires, and if they did it not, they
will proclaime Warre against them. Where as contrariwise it seemes
now, in leauing the true cause, and supposing a false one of the <hi>Sagon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,</hi>
they would make it not only without occasion, but also with great
outrage. And although the Embassadours vnderstood well, that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
necessity they must enter into Warre; yet they went vnto <hi>Carthage,</hi>
where they vsed the like speech.</p>
            <p>It is true the <hi>Romanes</hi> meant to Transport it into <hi>Spaine</hi> and not into
<hi>Italy,</hi> and to haue <hi>Sagont</hi> for a Fort. Wherefore in the interim, they
laboured first to pacifie the Wars of <hi>Sclauonia,</hi> as if they intended to
make a Warre that was long and tedious and farre from <hi>Italy.</hi> It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
at that time,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Demetrius:</hi> King of <hi>Sclauonia.</hi>
               </note> that when as <hi>Demetrius</hi> King of the <hi>Sclauonians</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
the many fauours which the <hi>Romanes</hi> had done him, for that hee
saw them prest on the one side with the feare of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> and on the
ther by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and that all his hope was in the King of
<hi>Macedon:</hi> for that hee had bin a pertaker of that Warre, which
<hi>Antigonus</hi> made against <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> ruining the Townes of the
<hi>Sclauonians</hi> which were subiect to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> forcing the Citty,
and exceeding the bounds limitted in the Treaty. The like hee did to
most parts of the Iland of <hi>Cyclades:</hi> So as he ruined all like a Tempest,
beeing accompanied with fifty strong Vessels. Whereof the <hi>Romanes</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:16537:64"/>
being aduertised, seeing at that time the Principallity of <hi>Macedon</hi> to
Triumph, they laboured with all their present meanes to pacifie the
affaires of <hi>Sclauonia,</hi> hoping it would prooue easie: And that soone
after, they should punish the basenesse of the <hi>Sclauonians,</hi> and the
ingratitude of <hi>Demetrius.</hi> But matters past otherwise then they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.
For whilest they imploy their time therein, <hi>Hannibal</hi> takes
<hi>Sagont</hi> much sooner then they conceiued. So as the Warre grew hot,
not in <hi>Spaine,</hi> but against the Citty of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thoroughout all
<hi>Italy.</hi> Yet the <hi>Romanes</hi> pursuing their enterprize, sent <hi>Lucius Emilius</hi>
into <hi>Sclauonia,</hi> the first yeare of the hundred and fifteth <hi>Olympiade,</hi> with
a very great Army to keep that Prouince in peace, and from future
danger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> parting from <hi>Carthagena</hi> with his whole Army, goes to
<hi>Sagont,</hi> a Towne scituated beyond the Riuer of <hi>Ebro,</hi> at the foote of
the Mountaine,<note place="margin">The scituation of <hi>Sagont.</hi>
               </note> which deuides <hi>Spaine</hi> from the <hi>Celtiberiens,</hi> about a
mile distant from the Sea. The people of this Countrey exceede all
the rest of <hi>Spaine</hi> in abundance of fruites, and in multitudes of men,
and they are the most Warlike. <hi>Hannibal</hi> entring into these limits
with his Army, and hauing ruined all the Countrey, he besiedged it
with all manner of Engines, conceiuing that the taking thereof
would prooue wonderfull commodious for his present Affaires.
First he considered that he should depriue the <hi>Romanes</hi> of all hope to
make Warre in <hi>Spaine;</hi>
               <note place="margin">The discretion of the head of an interprize.</note> and that moreouer he should strike a great ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
into the rest; and that by this meanes the Townes of <hi>Spaine</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
already vnder his obedience, would keepe their faith the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
Besides it was likely, that they which desired to liue still in their
liberty, would soone yeild: And that thirdly he immagined, that he
might then confidently pursue the Remainder, leauing no enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him.</p>
            <p>He hoped more ouer, to gather much Treasure for the intertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his War; and that he should gaine the hearts of the Souldiers
for the booty that euery one should get at the sacke of the Towne; and
that finally he should purchase the loue of the Cittizens remayning in
<hi>Carthage,</hi> with presents that he will send them of the spoiles. Beeing
mooued with these reasons, he wholy attends the siege of this Towne,
and inflames the hearts of the Souldiers, spurring them on sometimes
with rage against the Enemy, sometimes with hope of Recompence;
and sometimes he serues them for an example, aswell in making the
Engines, and approaching them to the Wals, as in going sometimes to
those places which were most dangerous. Finally, hee performed
all things so extraordinary well, as if hee had beene but a simple
Souldier.</p>
            <p>And when he had toyl'd his Body and minde herein for the space of
eight moneths,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sagont</hi> forced by <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
               </note> in the end he forced <hi>Sagont.</hi> Whereas after he had
made a great booty of gold and siluer, and taken many men, he kept
the money for the charges of the War, as he had formerly resolued,
deuiding the Prisoners among the Souldiers, according vnto their
seuerall dignities, and set the rest of the spoile vnto <hi>Carthage.</hi>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:16537:64"/>
After these things, hee was not deceiued in his hope, so as things suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
according to his desire: for his Souldiers were much more
ready to vndergoe all dangers: and the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> much more ready
to please him. Moreouer, this booty of money was a great meanes for
the enterprize he had in hand.</p>
            <p>During these actions, <hi>Demetrius</hi> King of the <hi>Sclauonians,</hi> discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the enterprize and preparation of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Demetrius</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefied <hi>Dimale.</hi>
               </note> hee presently
caused the Towne of <hi>Dimale</hi> to bee carefully furnished with men
and victuals: and as for the other Townes of <hi>Sclauonia,</hi> hee chased
away those that were of a contrary faction, suffering none but such
as held his party. Then hee made choice of sixe thousand old Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
out of his Army,<note place="margin">The arriuall of <hi>Emilius</hi> into <hi>Sclauonia.</hi>
               </note> and put himselfe into <hi>Phare.</hi> In the meane
time the Consull <hi>Emilius</hi> arriues safely in <hi>Sclauonia</hi> with his Army:
where being aduertised that the Enemies were confident and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
for that they were in hope, that the descent of the <hi>Romans</hi>
should not preuaile against them, relying much in the scituation
and munition of <hi>Dimale,</hi> hee thought good before all things, to
doe his vttermost endeauour to take it: thinking (as it afterwards
happened) that this being taken, all the rest amazed with feare,
would easily yeeld vnto the <hi>Romans.</hi> And after that hee had made
some speeches vnto the Souldiers, hee planted his Engines of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
against the Towne, and besieged it: which being forced on
the seauenth day, did so much amaze the Enemies, as presently
Embassies came from all the rest of <hi>Sclauonia,</hi> yeelding vnto the
<hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The which being receiued into Friendship,<note place="margin">The Towne of <hi>Sclauonia</hi> reduced to the <hi>Romane</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> and hauing treated
with euery one according to their condition, hee causeth his Army
to march directly to <hi>Phare,</hi> whereas the King of the <hi>Sclauonians</hi>
made his abode. But for that hee found this Towne strong by sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation,
and mann'd with the choise of the Army, and moreouer, well
furnished with Victuals, and all kinds of munition, hee feared the
siege would bee long and difficult. Finally, being long in supence,<note place="margin">The warlike pollicy or <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius.</hi>
               </note>
he takes this counsell. Hee vseth all diligence and labour to gaine the
Iland in the Night, and doth lodge a great part of his Army in the
thickest of the Forrest: as for himselfe, at the breake of day, hee
gaines the neerest Port vnto the Towne with twenty shipps. The
<hi>Sclauonians</hi> seeing the Enemies shipps, and making no accompt of
their number, they goe forth with a great Fleete to hinder the
landing of the <hi>Romans,</hi> where they charg'd them, and for a time
the Combate was very furious, there comming still Succours vnto
them from the Towne by files, so as in the end all the Citty was
drawne thither.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Romans</hi> who had layne all night in Ambush in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
hearing the noise, ranne with all speed by couered places, and
gaining a little Hill which was strong by nature, within the Towne
and Port, they tooke from their Enemies all meanes of returne.
The which the <hi>Sclauonians</hi> well perceiuing, they leaue their first
enterprize to repulse the Enemy, and drawing together in one troupe,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:16537:65"/>
they encourage one another, as men resolued to go and fight against
those which held the Hill. On the other side the <hi>Romans</hi> seeing the
<hi>Sclauonians</hi> approach, put themselues in battell, and charg'd them,
fighting with great resolution and courage: The other part of the
Army at Sea, landed, march't, and prest the enemy in the Reare. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for as much as the <hi>Romans</hi> charg'd them on all sides, and that
the <hi>Sclauonians</hi> were prest before and behind, the Combate was
long and cruell. Finally, the <hi>Romans</hi> had the Victory. The greatest

               <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Night following saued himselfe contrary to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of all the World, by meanes of certaine Vessels which hee had
appointed in three places for his safety, the case so happening: and
retired to <hi>Phillip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> with whom hee spent the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of his dayes. Hee was a man of great courage and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening,
but of little iudgement in Martiall affaires. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee ended according to the life which hee had formerly led:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Demetrius</hi> a man of great courage and little iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>
For when as at <hi>Phillips</hi> desire hee had begunne to besiege the Towne
of the <hi>Messenians,</hi> hee was most shamefully slaine by the Enemy,
for his great and ouerweening boldnesse. But wee will speake of
these things more particularly, when wee shall come vnto that time.
When as <hi>Emilius</hi> had so suddainly gotten <hi>Phare,</hi> hee razed the
Towne to the ground. And hauing within few dayes reduced
the rest of the Townes of <hi>Sclauonia</hi> to the <hi>Romane</hi> obedience,<note place="margin">The Towne of <hi>Phare</hi> razed.</note> and
decided all the affaires of the Prouince as hee had resolued, hee
returnes to <hi>Rome</hi> in the beginning of Autumne: where hee was
receiued with wonderfull great glory, triumph, and good esteeme
of all men, to haue done not onely like a wise and discreete man, but
like a resolute.</p>
            <p>But when in the meane time newes came to <hi>Rome</hi> of the razing of
<hi>Sagont,</hi> some haue written, that the Lords of the <hi>Romane</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
were not of opinion to make Warre, and they alledge causes
and reasons which held them in suspence. But what can bee spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
more vnreasonably? How is it likely, that they which the
yeere before had signified Warre vnto the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> if they
entred the <hi>Sagontins</hi> Countrey, should now growe doubtfull, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
after the taking of <hi>Sagont,</hi> they should make Warre, or not?
But is there any thing lesse worthy of credit, to say, that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
on the one side was wonderfully heauy and afflicted, as if all
had beene vtterly lost: On the other side that the Fathers brought
all their Children to the Senare, so as they were aboue twelue
yeeres of age, and that being partakers of the Councell, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
reuealed, or made knowne the secrets to any? Without doubt
these things are neither true nor likely, vnlesse the <hi>Romans</hi> haue that
gift of nature, to bee wise from their Cradles.</p>
            <p>We haue discoursed sufficiently of these writings which are of <hi>Cherea</hi>
and <hi>Solilus:</hi> neither haue they so much shew of a History, as of old wiues
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:16537:65"/>
Tales: and are like vnto those which they vsually tell in Barbers shops.
The <hi>Romans</hi> then after the newes of the taking of <hi>Sagont,</hi> and the
murther of their Allies, sent presently an Embassie to <hi>Carthage,</hi> to
let them vnderstand two things, whereof the one seemed to bee of
consequence, for ignomy and losse of the <hi>Carthaginions,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had a shew to draw their Empire in hazard. For they demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that they should either deliuer <hi>Hannibal</hi> to bee punished
for the breach of the publique Faith, or else they should hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
assured of Warre. When as the Embassadours were come to
<hi>Carthage,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Roman</hi> Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours sent to <hi>Carthage.</hi>
               </note> and that the Senate had giuen them audience, they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
their Commission: which was not without the indignation of
of the <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> who made choice of <hi>Hanno</hi> to debate their
Right, who at the first made no accompt of <hi>Asdrubals</hi> treatie,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hanno's</hi> answer to the <hi>Romane</hi> Embassadours.</note> as
hauing neuer beene made with the <hi>Romans:</hi> and if it were so, the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> were not bound vnto it, for that <hi>Asdrubal</hi> had excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his Commission, and had done it without the authority of the
Senate or people of <hi>Carthage.</hi> Whereunto hee alleadged in the
like case, that the <hi>Romans</hi> had beene of opinion, that the accord
made in <hi>Sicily</hi> by the Consull <hi>Luctatius</hi> should bee broken, for
that it had beene made without the authority of the people of
<hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, hee insisted still vpon this accord whilest his Speech conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
and reade it often, saying, that there was no mention made
of <hi>Ebro,</hi> and that the Allies of the one and of the other were onely
reserued: and that moreouer, it did nothing concerne the <hi>Sagontins,</hi>
for that at the time of the accord they were not allied vnto the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
The Embassadours repuls'd with great words this contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
concerning the right of the accorde, as a thing which concernes
the honour of the people of <hi>Rome:</hi> saying that the quarrels might
bee decided, if the <hi>Sagontins</hi> were in there entire. But now that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gont</hi>
is razed, and that the faith and accords are wickedly broken,
they should either deliuer the Authour of the Crime to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
to the end that all the World might know, that <hi>Sagont</hi> hath not
beene ouerthrowne and ruined with the consent of the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi>
Or if they will not, but confesse that the Towne hath beene
destroyed with their consent, that they should prepare to Warre.
Thus ended their discourse, which they held more amply and in
generall.</p>
            <p>I haue held it most necessary not to passe ouer this particular in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
to the end the truth may not bee hidden to those which
deale in publique affaires, or which haue cause to consider exactly
of these things: Or else haue a desire to know whether they erre,
being deceiued by the ignorance and sottishnesse of Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
for want of knowledge of the treaties which from the first
<hi>Punique</hi> Warre, vnto our times haue beene made betwixt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
and the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> The first then was made betwixt
these two Nations, immediately after that the name of King
was chased out of <hi>Rome, Lucius, Iunius, Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Marcus
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:16537:66"/>
Valerius</hi> being Consuls, vnder whom also a Temple was dedicated to
<hi>Iupiter Capitolinus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Temple of <hi>Iupiter Capitoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
               </note> eight and twenty yeeres before the first voyage of
<hi>Xerxes</hi> into <hi>Greece:</hi> the which wee haue interpreted with the greatest
diligence wee could possibly. Beleeue me, the <hi>Romane</hi> tongue hath
beene so changed since that time vnto our dayes,<note place="margin">The <hi>Romane</hi> tongue chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note> as they which are the
best instructed in Antiquities, vnderstand not much of it, but with
great difficulty.</p>
            <p>This accord containes in a manner thus much:<note place="margin">The first ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord betwixt the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>
               </note> The people of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> shall liue in Amity and Friendship: The like shall
their Allies doe. The <hi>Romans</hi> and their Allies shall not saile beyond
the Promontory of <hi>Beauty,</hi> vnlesse they be forced by storme, or the
violence of their Enemies. If any one takes Port for these causes, hee
shall not buy,<note place="margin">I conceiue that this Promonto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is that which they call the Promontory of <hi>Mercure,</hi> in <hi>Affricke,</hi> where as now the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Clipca</hi> stands.</note> nor take anything, but what necessity shall require for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
and for Ships. And that within the fift day they shall set faile
for their retreate. They which shall arriue there for the trade of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize,
shall be free, except the duties which belong vnto the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister,
and to the Citty, who shall giue a Certificate of all that which
shalbe sold in their presence, in <hi>Affricke</hi> or <hi>Sardinia.</hi> If any <hi>Romane</hi>
arriues in <hi>Sicily,</hi> where the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> are Lords, they shall doe
him no wrong. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> shall doe no outrage to the <hi>Arde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates,
Anciates, Arrentins, Circins, Tarraconnois,</hi> nor the other <hi>Latins</hi>
which are subiect to the <hi>Romans.</hi> And if there bee any other Citty
which is not subiect, it is not comprehended. If the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> take
any one, they shall restore it entire to the <hi>Romans,</hi> neither shall they
build any Fort in <hi>Italy.</hi> And if they be entred into the Prouince as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
they shall not stay a whole night. Behold in a manner what
the first Treatie contayned. You must vnderstand that the Promonto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>Beauty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of <hi>Beauty.</hi>
               </note> is right against <hi>Carthage,</hi> hauing its aspect to the North.
Beyond the which towards the South, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> would not
suffer the <hi>Romans</hi> to saile with any ships of Warre.</p>
            <p>The reason was as it seemes, for feare they should come and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the places which are about the Banks of <hi>Barbary,</hi> which the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi>
call the Merchants Countrey, by reason of the fertility thereof.
And therefore if any one driuen by a storme, or prest by the enemy, cast
himselfe vpon that Quarter, it was not lawfull for him to take any
thing but what was necessary to repaire his ships, or to sacrifice: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
likewise forced to weigh Anchor, and set saile the fift day. As for
<hi>Carthage</hi> and the other Countries of <hi>Affricke,</hi> which are on this side
the Promontory, and as for <hi>Sardinia</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> whereas the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
were Lords, it was lawfull to sayle thither for trafficke: For
the effecting whereof the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had sworne to obserue and
keepe it.</p>
            <p>But it seemes that in this treaty, that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> make mention
of <hi>Affricke</hi> and <hi>Sardinia,</hi> as of their owne Prouinces, holding other
termes of <hi>Sicily,</hi> which adde the Countrey wherein they are obeyed.
The <hi>Romans</hi> also doe the like for the Countrey of the <hi>Latins:</hi> and as for
the rest of <hi>Italy,</hi> they make not any mention, for that it was not yet sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
vnto them. Afterwards there was another treaty made, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:16537:66"/>
the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> comprehended the <hi>Tyrriens</hi> and <hi>Bisarthins:</hi> There
was also added to the Cape of Beauty, <hi>Mastia,</hi> and <hi>Tarseron:</hi> Without
the which it was not lawfull for the <hi>Romanes</hi> to pretend any Countrey,
nor to purchase or build any new Citty. Behold the Contents: The
<hi>Romanes</hi> and their Allies, the <hi>Carthaginians, Tyrriens,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The second Accord.</note> and <hi>Bisarthins,</hi>
and their Allies, shall liue in friendship. The <hi>Romanes</hi> not their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
shall not saile beyond the Promontory of Beauty, nor or <hi>Mastia,</hi>
or <hi>Tarseion,</hi> to rob and spoile, nor to Trafficke, nor to build any
Towne. If the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> take any Towne in <hi>Italy,</hi> which is not
subiect to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> they shall haue spoile, and restore the Towne
vnto the <hi>Romanes.</hi> If they haue taken any of the free people, which
were Allied to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> they shall not bring them vnto any Port
which belongs vnto the <hi>Romanes.</hi> And if they bring any one thither,
and he be knowne to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> they shall be set at liberty. The like
shall be done vnto the <hi>Romanes</hi> in those Townes which are subiect to
the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a <hi>Roman</hi> refreshes himselfe with Water and Victuals, the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi>
shall do him no wrong, with whom they haue concluded a
peace and friendship, and if they do it, the outrage shall be held pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke.
And as for <hi>Sardinia</hi> and <hi>Affricke,</hi> the <hi>Romanes</hi> nor their Allies
may not Trafficke nor haue any Towne, or buy any thing but what is
necessary, for Sacrifice or the repairing of their shippes. And if any
ship be cast vpon that Coast by Tempest, they shall set Saile within the
fifth day. In regard of <hi>Sicily,</hi> the <hi>Romanes</hi> may Trafficke where the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> are obeyed: The like they may do at <hi>Carthage,</hi> and vse
the same righ's which the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> obserue. The which in the
like case the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> may doe at <hi>Rome.</hi> In this Treaty it seemes
that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> shew that <hi>Sardinia</hi> and <hi>Affricke</hi> were wholy
theirs, and that they would depriue the <hi>Romanes</hi> of the right of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</hi>
But as for <hi>Sicily</hi> of that part onely which they hold.</p>
            <p>It was also Articulated,<note place="margin">Other Articles past betwixt the <hi>Romanes</hi> &amp; the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
               </note> that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> should not make
Warre against the <hi>Ardiatins,</hi> the <hi>Antiates,</hi> the <hi>Circins, Tarraconnois,</hi>
nor against the other <hi>Latine</hi> Citties which lie vpon the Sea, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
the <hi>Latine</hi> Region. As for the rest of <hi>Italy,</hi> there was no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made. Since there was a third Accord made, at such time as
<hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of the <hi>Epirotes</hi> past into <hi>Italy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The third Accord.</note> before the beginning of
the Punique Warre. Wherein were comprehended the same Articles,
adding moreouer, that if they agreed with <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> they should giue
succour one vnto another in the Country that was assailed: And if ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them had need of assistance, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> should furnish
Ships aswell for the passage, as for the Combate, either of them pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Souldiers. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> should succour the <hi>Romans</hi> by
Sea, and no man should be forced to Land his men. But as I haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
the oath of the first Treaties was made in this manner.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> sware by the gods of their Countrey:<note place="margin">The manner of Swearing of the <hi>Romanes</hi> &amp; <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in their treati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Romanes</hi> by the Stone, according to their auncient Custome, calling
thereunto the powers of <hi>Mars</hi> the Warlike. Behold the manner which
they obserued to sweare by the Stone. The Herald of Armes, after
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:16537:67"/>
the Treaty of Peace was concluded betwixt the two Nations, hauing
the Stone in his hands, vsed these Words. I pray vnto the gods that
all things may come successefully vnto me, if this Accord and Oath
which I take, be done iustly and without fraud. But if I do or thinke
otherwise that I may die alone, as this Stone shall fall out of my hand,
all the rest being sound and safe in their owne Country, their Lawes,
Houses, Temples, and Sepulchers, and without speaking any Word
more, he let the Stone fall out of his hand.</p>
            <p>As these things are true, and are at this day to be seene, grauen in Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of Brasse, in the Temple of <hi>Iupiter Capitolium,</hi> where they are
carefully kept by the <hi>Ediles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phisinus</hi> a Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storiographer.</note> Who will not wonder at the Historio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher
<hi>Philinus,</hi> not for that he knew it not (for without doubt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
auncient <hi>Romanes</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> I say of our time, and which
haue beene very curious of such things, do not know it:) But for that
he hath dared to write things quite contrary; saying that in these Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
was contained that the <hi>Romanes</hi> should quit all <hi>Sycily,</hi> and the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> all <hi>Italy?</hi> Wherefore the <hi>Romans</hi> has broken their faith
and promise, at their first Voiage into <hi>Sycily.</hi> And yet this is not
found Written.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philinus</hi> hath written this Discourse in the second of his Books, the
which relating lightly in the first Booke, we haue reserued to this place,
to the end we may debate it in perticular: holding it necessary, least
some one might stray from the Truth, following the errour of <hi>Philinus.</hi>
It will not be happily without reason, if some one will hold the Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of the <hi>Romans</hi> into <hi>Sycily</hi> worthy of blame, for that they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
the <hi>Mamertins</hi> into friendship, and presently sent forces after
in their extreame necessity, considering that a little before they had
spoiled <hi>Messina</hi> and <hi>Rhegium</hi> with great cruelty, beeing two of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chest
Townes in <hi>Sycily.</hi> But this were to iudge like an ignorant man,
that in passing into <hi>Sycily</hi> they had broken their faith and promise. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that the Warre of <hi>Sycily</hi> was ended there was another Accord made,
whereof this is the Tenor. That the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> should not onely
voide out of <hi>Sycily,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Another accord made betwixt the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>
               </note> but out of all the Islands which are betwixt it and
<hi>Italy.</hi> And the Allies of the one and the other should haue no Rule in
neither of their Countries; nor should make any Forts, nor draw
foorth any Souldiers, nor make Alliance with either of their Allies;
and that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> should pay thirteene hundred and twenty
thousand Crownes within ten yeares: Whereof sixe hundred thousand
should be presently paied, and that moreouer they should deliuer all
the <hi>Romane</hi> Prisoners without ransome.</p>
            <p>Besides all this the <hi>Romanes</hi> declaring Warre vnto them, when they
were much troubled and afflicted in <hi>Affricke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</note> they forced them to
make a new Treaty: Where it was sayd, that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> should
leaue <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and pay (besides the summe agreed vpon,) seauen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand Crownes. After all these Treaties, the last was made in
<hi>Spaine</hi> with <hi>Asdrubal,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord made with <hi>Asdrubal.</hi>
               </note> where the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were forbidden to passe
the Riuer of <hi>Ebro</hi> or <hi>Iberus</hi> in Armes. Behold all the Treaties which
the people of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> made, from the first Punique Warre
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:16537:67"/>
vnto the second, which the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> mannaged vnder the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of <hi>Hannibal.</hi> But it is doubtlesse, that as wee haue shewed that
the <hi>Romanes</hi> did not breake their faith when they past into <hi>Sycily,</hi> as
doth plainly appeare: So afterwards they declared Warre against the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> without reason: when as they made the Treaty for <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia:</hi>
for truely there can be no reason found therein. Contrariwise
we see plainely that besides all the agreements, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> left
<hi>Sardinia,</hi> and payed a greater summe of mony, being forced by the
malice of the time. And as for that, wherewith the <hi>Romanes</hi> shelter
themselues, that they were forced thereunto, for that they had out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
their Merchants at Sea: This had beene formerly decided, when
as the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> deliuered the Prisoners without Ransome. These
are things whereof we haue spoken, when in the precedent Booke we
haue related that which was to be said in perticular. Let vs now come
to the causes of the second Punique War, and let vs see which of the
two Nations is to be blamed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> obiected those causes which we haue related.<note place="margin">The causes pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pounded by the <hi>Romans</hi> for the Warre.</note> In
regard of the <hi>Romanes</hi> they brought none for the present, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
they had for the razing of <hi>Sagont.</hi> Yet behold those which
they and others do vsually obiect. First there is no comparison betwixt
the Treaty which <hi>Asdrubal</hi> made and that of <hi>Luctatius,</hi> although
the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> will haue it so. For it was sayd in that of <hi>Luctatius,</hi>
that it should hold good if the people of <hi>Rome</hi> consent vnto it. And as
for that of <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> there was no such condition: Where it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
sayd, that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> should not passe beyond <hi>Ebro.</hi> And
it was sayd in the other, that the Allies of either part should liue in
peace: Vnder which termes were not only comprehended those which
then were not Allied: For it would haue beene Articulated, that the
one nor the other should make any new Alliance; or that they which
should newly enter, should not be comprehended, whereof there is
nothing Written. For with that whereof formerly they had giuen or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that none of those which should enter newly into Alliance, should
be wronged: Who will beleeue that eyther of these powerful Nations
would restraine himselfe from receiuing those he should think good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Alliance, or to defend those that were receiued? In trueth I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
that in making their Treaty, their chiefe intent was, that their
Allies should liue in safety, and that it should not be lawful for them to
receiue the Allies of the one and the other into alliance: and it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
that the new alliances might not draw Souldiers out of the others
Prouinces, nor beare any rule there; and that they should all Line in
peace.</p>
            <p>Matters standing in these Termes, it is manifest that the <hi>Sagontins</hi>
were allied vnto the <hi>Romanes</hi> long before <hi>Hannibal:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Sagontins</hi> Allied a long time with the <hi>Romances.</hi>
               </note> The which is so
probable as the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> cannot deny it. For the <hi>Sagontins</hi> for a
mutiny which grew in their Towne, sent not vnto the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
although they were their Neighbours, and held the greatest part of
<hi>Spaine;</hi> but retired to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> by whose meanes the sedition was
pacified and supprest. If they say that the razing of <hi>Sagont</hi> hath beene
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:16537:68"/>
the cause of this Warre, they must likewise confesse that the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
had no reason to make Warre against the <hi>Romanes,</hi> aswell by the
Treaty made with <hi>Luctatius,</hi> wherein it was contained that they should
do no outrage vnto the Allies, as by that which was made by <hi>Asdrubal,</hi>
by the which the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were restrained from passing the Riuer
of <hi>Ebro</hi> in Armes. Likewise if they will say, that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
had taken this Warre to heart, for <hi>Sardinia</hi> which had beene taken
from them, and for the summe of money which they had payed:
I make no doubt that they were not to bee blamed, if attending
the opportunity of the time they sought to reuenge: Yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
there wilbe some, who not duly considering heereof, will i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
it idle and to no purpose, that I examine these reasons so dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently.</p>
            <p>For my part I am of opinion,<note place="margin">The opinion of <hi>Polybius</hi> in the diligence of a History.</note> that if a man be so well furnished with
all things necessary, as he needes not any assistance, yet the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of things past wilbe pleasing vnto him, and it may be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
If likewise any one dare not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>relie vpon this, aswell in priuate
affaires as publicke, considering he is a man: and that he knowes well
that this present felicity may be lost, considering that the Fortune of
men is fraile and without continuance: Then I say that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of things past is not onely pleasant but necessary. But how
may a man finde aide and succours to defend himselfe, being wronged
in his owne Countrey? Or draw all the VVorld vnto his owne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
making a new enterprize? Or assure the hearts of his men
when Fortune fauours him, if hee haue not a true particular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the deedes of his Ancestors? Beleeue me by this meanes
he shalbe ready and instructed in present affaires to be able to say, and
doe things, whereby all enterprizes shalbe discouered, and the
Truth vnderstood. For things that are done and past, are good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
for those that shal succeed and come after, shewing vs the
meanes, aduise, and policies, whereby wee may purchase grace,
helpe, and comfort: Or contrariwise, procure hatred, malice, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
and so mooue to Iustice and reason. All which are of great
Consequence vnto a man, aswell for his priuate affaires, as for the
publicke.</p>
            <p>And therefore I am of aduice, that Historiographers and they
which giue themselues to read Histories, should not so much respect
the Actions, as their Consequence and that which goes before. For
if you take from a History which mentions but the deeds, how, nor
wherefore it hapned, and what the end was, that which shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
will haue no instructions, and will be but a kinde of Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Although happily it may seeme at the first sight something plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
but for the future they shall reape no profite. It is true, some
will say that it is no easie thing to recouer such a History, and that
they cannot well finde it for the greatnesse and number of Bookes.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Polybius</hi> hath made forty Bookes.</note>
Beleeue me, they doe not vnderstand how much more easie it is to
haue, and to read forty Bookes made with good order, whereas
the deedes and actions of <hi>Italy, Sycily,</hi> and <hi>Affricke,</hi> from the voiage
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:16537:68"/>
of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> vnto the taking of <hi>Carthage</hi> are comprized: And
as for those of the other parts of the World, from the flight of <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi>
vnto the Warre which the <hi>Romans</hi> had against the <hi>Acheins,</hi> neere
vnto the <hi>Isthmus:</hi> Then to make prouision, or to reade so many
Bookes of so many particular Histories: For as they exceede ours
in greatnesse and number, so it is a difficult thing to comprehend any
thing certaine. First, that all write not of the same things, and omit
those which haue beene done at the same time: the which if they were
conferr'd together, would the better discouer the truth.</p>
            <p>Finally, they cannot attaine to that which is necessary to the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which are the things which precede the actions, and concerne
the causes. For our part, wee will consider the Warre of <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
as hauing taken its occasion from that of <hi>Phillip,</hi> and that of
<hi>Phillip</hi> from the <hi>Punique</hi> Warre, and the <hi>Punique</hi> from that of <hi>Sicily:</hi>
Whereas all the accidents which haue happened in the meane time,
and may bee referred to one beginning, are diligently obserued. All
which things may be easily vnderstood by him that hath written a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
History: the which is impossible by them which speake of
particular Warres, as of the <hi>Persique</hi> or <hi>Phillippique:</hi> vnlesse perchance
some one holds opinion to be able to vnderstand a whole Warre by the
knowledge of one Battell: which is impossible. And therefore our
History ought to be more esteemed, than that of particular Warres, for
that it is more excellent to haue learned some thing perfectly, than to
haue onely heard of it.</p>
            <p>But to returne from whence wee strayed, when the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours
saw that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> disguised matters, they spake no
more. But the most ancient among them taking vp the skirt of his
Roabe,<note place="margin">The Roman Embassadours signifie Warre vnto the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians.</hi>
               </note> and shewing it to the Senate, Behold saith hee, wherein I
bring you Warre or Peace: take which you please. Whereunto the
Chiefe of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> answered, deliuer which you will. And
when he had spoken, he deliuered them Warre, many of the Senate
cryed out, that they accepted it. Vpon this discourse the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
and Senate retired. <hi>Hannibal</hi> wintering at <hi>Carthage,</hi> had giuen
leaue to his Souldiers to returne into their Countrey, if happily there
were any that desired to see their Kinsfolkes and Friends:<note place="margin">The order which <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> gaue for the defence of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
               </note> To the
end that hauing endured so much toile, they might fortifie their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and mindes, to endure new labour. Moreouer, he instructs his
brother <hi>Asdrubal</hi> by what meanes (if hee were forced to part
out of the Prouince) he should defend and gouerne <hi>Spaine</hi> against all
the attempts of the <hi>Romans.</hi> Then hee sends a great Garrison into
<hi>Affricke</hi> of men which he drew out of <hi>Spaine:</hi> for hee had caused
Souldiers to come out of <hi>Affricke</hi> into <hi>Spaine,</hi> making cunningly
this diuision of his men: to the end that the <hi>Affricans</hi> being
there, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Affricke,</hi> they should grow better by
mutuall obligations.</p>
            <p>They which past into <hi>Affricke,</hi> were <hi>Thersites, Mastianes, Orites, Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
and <hi>Olcades:</hi> hauing appointed the number of them to be twelue
hundred Horse, and thirteene thousand eight hundred &amp; fifty Foot: and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:16537:69"/>
besides these eight hundred and fifty Slingers of <hi>Maiorque</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norque,</hi>
called <hi>Balleares,</hi> with their Iland, by reason of the vse of the
Sling. He commaunds they should lodge the greatest part in <hi>Affricke,</hi>
and that the rest should remaine at <hi>Carthage</hi> for its strength. He doth
also leauy foure thousand Foote, the choice of the youth within the
heart of <hi>Spaine:</hi> the which hee causeth to march to <hi>Carthage,</hi> not
so much to fortifie it, as to serue for Hostages. Hee also left in

one and twenty Elephants. No man onght to wonder at our diligence
in this description, If I so obserue it in the affaires of <hi>Hannibal</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi>
that euen they which practised it, could hardly obserue: Nor blame
vs for that after the manner of lyars, we relate I know not what pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
triuiall things,<note place="margin">The number of <hi>Hannibals</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in a Table of Copper seene by <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius.</hi>
               </note> the more easily to giue credit vnto our writing. For
when I had seene at <hi>Lauynium</hi> a Table of Copper, which <hi>Hannibal</hi> had
left there, when as he ouer-ran <hi>Italy,</hi> wherein this number was contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
I thought sit to giue credit vnto it; and therefore wee haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
it heere.</p>
            <p>When as <hi>Hannibal</hi> had prouided for <hi>Affricke</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
the returne of such as hee had sent to moue the <hi>Gaules,</hi> by whose
Country he was to passe his Army. You must vnderstand that he had
sent men to winne them by Presents, and to view the passages of the
Mountaine, for that he was aduertised that this Region was very fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
and very well peopled with resolute men, and good Souldiers,
and mortall Enemies to the <hi>Romans,</hi> for the Warre which they made
against the <hi>Gaules,</hi> expecting that his Warre should be onely in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
if hee might passe his Army safely by the streights of the <hi>Alpes</hi>
with their helpe. After the returne of his men, and that he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised
of the expectance and desire of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> and that the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
of the Hills were rough and painefull, not altogether inacces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
he drew his Army together in the Spring. It is true, that the
newes which at the same time hee receiued, of that which happened
at <hi>Carthage,</hi> inflamed his cholle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the more against the <hi>Romans,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
thereby a confident hope of the fidelity and affection of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
When as all the Army was drawne together, <hi>Hannibal</hi> made an
Oration,<note place="margin">The Oration which <hi>Hannibal</hi> made to his Souldiers.</note> not to any one part, but publickely to all the Souldiers, by
diuers meanes perswading them to imbrace the Warre against the
<hi>Romans:</hi> and how that hee and the other Captaines of <hi>Carthage</hi> had
bene demanded of them for to be put to death, for the taking of <hi>Sagont.</hi>
Hee acquaints them likewise of the fertility of the Prouince whither
they made their voyage, making great esteeme and respect of the
Friendshippe and alliance of the <hi>Gaules.</hi> After which speech, seeing
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:16537:69"/>
them all resolute, and that they demaunded nothing but to parte, he
commended their good will and prowesse. And after he had told them
the day when they should trusse vp their baggage, he dismist them.
In the meane time, when he had made all necessary preparations for his
Voyage,<note place="margin">The number of Horse and Foot which were in <hi>Hannibals</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from <hi>Spaine.</hi>
               </note> hee dislodg'd suddainly, when the day of parting was
come, with fourescore and ten thousand Foote, and twelue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Horse, and past the Riuer of <hi>Ebro.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then within few dayes, hee brought vnder his obedience the <hi>Ilerge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,</hi>
the <hi>Bargusins,</hi> the <hi>Erinosins,</hi> and <hi>Andolisiens:</hi> the like they
did to all other Townes vnto the <hi>Pyrenee</hi> Mountaines, razing some.
And as hee performed this sooner than any man could conceiue, so he
did it not without many cruell battels, and great losse of men. He set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Hanno</hi> Gouernour of this Countrey, and made him likewise Lord
of the <hi>Bargusins:</hi> for that hee did not greatly trust those people, for the
Alliance they had with the <hi>Romans:</hi> and hee gaue him ten thousand
Foote,<note place="margin">The number of men which <hi>Hannibal</hi> left to <hi>Hanno</hi> for the guard of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
               </note> and a thousand Horse for the guard of their Countrey, leauing
with him all their baggage which march't with him. Hee sent backe
the like number of <hi>Spaniards</hi> to their houses, partly for that hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
they were grieued with the length of the Iourney, and the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
passages of the Mountaines: and partly to giue hope vnto others, to
returne sometimes into their Countrey: and that they which he left in
their houses, should march more willingly into <hi>Italy,</hi> if he needed suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours.
He march't then with the rest of his Army,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibals</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of 50<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Foote and nine thousand Horse.</note> which amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto the number of fifty thousand Foote, and nine thousand
Horse.</p>
            <p>And passing the <hi>Pyrenee</hi> Mountaines, he drew neere vnto the mouth
of the Riuer of <hi>Rhone,</hi> not so well accompanied with great numbers as
good men, who had beene alwayes victorious. But to the end this
may not seeme too obscure by the ignorance of places, wee haue
thought it fit to shew in few words, from whence <hi>Hannibal</hi> parted, and
what great Countries hee past, and into what parts of <hi>Italy</hi> he entred.
It is true, wee haue not set downe the names of the places, as many Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storiographers
doe, thinking that all will the better bee vnderstood, if
they haue the knowledge thereof: For my part, I am of opinion, that
the relation of the names of places, whereof we haue knowledge, are
of great profit, for the more easie vnderstanding, and more certaine
memory of things. But where the places are vnknowne, their
names are like vnto that manner of voice, which besides the hearing,
signifies nothing. By this meanes it happens, that seeing our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
doth not comprehend any thing by the name, and the which
knowne, cannot breed any great profit, that the relation is altogether
fruitlesse. And therefore wee must finde meanes, by the which
speaking of places that are vnknowne, we may make the truth to be
vnderstood by the Readers with all our power.</p>
            <p>The first and principall knowledge, common to all men, is the
Diuision of this World wherein wee are contained, by the which
wee know (euen Ideots) the East, West, South and North. The second
is by the which attributing to euery one of these parts the parties of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:16537:70"/>
World wee come in some sort to the knowledge of places which we
haue neuer seene. But as the round Circle of the Earth consists of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
parts, whereof some are inhabitable, and others in scituation op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to ours,<note place="margin">The diuision of the World in three parts.</note> inhabited by the <hi>Antipodes:</hi> Wee must for the present
speake onely of the scituation of the Countrey which wee inhabite.
And for that it is diuided into three parts, and hath three names, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they call the one <hi>Asia,</hi> the other <hi>Affricke,</hi> and the third <hi>Europe.</hi>
It is a diuision which the Riuers of <hi>Tanais</hi> and <hi>Nile</hi> make, ioyning to
the streights of <hi>Hercules</hi> Pillars. <hi>Asia</hi> is seated betwixt <hi>Nile</hi> and <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nais,</hi>
taking its extent towards the East and South. In regard of <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke,</hi>
it is seated betwixt the <hi>Nile</hi> and the Pillars of <hi>Hercules,</hi> taking
its extent vnder the South, and towards the <hi>Hiuernall</hi> west vnto the
Equinoxiall, and to the streights of <hi>Gibeltar.</hi> Finally, these two
parts seeme to hold more the Countrey vnder the South, from the
East following our Sea then towards the West.</p>
            <p>And as for <hi>Europe,</hi> it is limited drawing towards the North, and
continuing from the East vnto the West: whose greatest extent lies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the North, betwixt the Riuer of <hi>Tanais</hi> and <hi>Narbonna,</hi> which is
not farre from the Countrey of <hi>Marcelles</hi> towards the West, and the
mouthes of the Riuer of <hi>Rhone,</hi> which lose themselues in the <hi>Sardini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Sea. The <hi>Gaules</hi> hold all that Countrey, from <hi>Narbonna</hi> vnto the
<hi>Perinee</hi> Mountaines, the which extend themselues from our Sea vnto
the Ocean, and as for the rest of <hi>Europe</hi> from the <hi>Perinee</hi> Mountaines
vnto the West, I meane vnto the Pillars of <hi>Hercules,</hi> it is enuironed
on the one side by our Sea, and on the other by the maine Ocean. The
Countrey about which our Sea doth flowe, vnto the Pillars of
<hi>Hercules,</hi> is called <hi>Spaine.</hi> And as for that which hath its aspect to the
Ocean, it hath not yet any knowne name that hath come to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
although it bee fully inhabited by Barbarous people, of whom
we will speake particularly when we come to their Ranke. For as the
Region which is neere vnto <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> whereas <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Affricke</hi>
ioynes, is at this day vnknowne, whether it be firme land continued
towards the South, or inclosed by the Sea: So likewise the Countrey
is at this day vnknowne, which betwixt <hi>Tanais</hi> and <hi>Narbonna</hi> drawes
towards the North: so as they dreame which speake or write any
thing.</p>
            <p>It was necessary to make this digression, to the end that the deeds
which we are to relate, might not be altogether obscure to those which
know not the places, and that they might come the knowledge of the
truth as much as is possible, by the Regions of Heauen and Earth. For
we haue beene alwaies accustomed to turne our face continually to that
which they teach vs by reason and example: The vnderstanding must
alwayes haue regard to those Countries which are interposed in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
Leauing then our discourse,<note place="margin">What the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> held in <hi>Affrick.</hi>
               </note> let vs returne to the continuance
of our speech. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> at that time held all the <hi>Affricaine</hi>
shore, whereas our Sea flowes, from the <hi>Philonien</hi> Altars, neere vnto
the Bankes of <hi>Barbary,</hi> vnto the Pillars of <hi>Hercules</hi> (this containes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
sixteene thousand Furlongs) and in passing that little Sea which is
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:16537:70"/>
betwixt <hi>Affricke</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> they had Conquered all <hi>Spaine,</hi> vnto the
<hi>Perinee</hi> mountaines, which diuide that Prouince from <hi>Gaule.</hi> From
the which vnto streights of <hi>Gebeltar,</hi> where stand the Pillars of <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
there is about eight thousand Furlongs: And from the streight vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the new Towne, which some call <hi>Carthage,</hi> from whence <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
parted to go into <hi>Italy,</hi> three thousand furlongs: And from <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi>
to <hi>Ebro,</hi> two thousand sixe hundred furlongs: From thence to
the <hi>Empories,</hi> sixteene hundred: And from thence to the mouth of the
Riuer of <hi>Rhone</hi> sixeteene hundred furlongs. Behold the measure of
those places which the <hi>Romanes</hi> haue made with great diligence. From
the passage of the <hi>Rhone,</hi> following the Bankes towards the Spring,
vnto the passage of the <hi>Alpes</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> thirteene hundred furlongs;
and the passage of the Mountayne is held to be twelue hundred. After
which they come into the Champion Countrey which is about <hi>Poe.</hi>
And therefore <hi>Hannibal</hi> was to march nine thousand furlongs, from
<hi>Carthage</hi> vnto the entry of <hi>Italy.</hi> And if we will obserue the way, he
had already past the one halfe: But if we will consider the difficulty of
the Country, he had the most troublesome taske to performe. <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
endeauoured by all meanes to passe the <hi>Perinee</hi> Mountaines, not
without some feare of the <hi>Gaules;</hi> least knowing the passages, they
should interrupt his voyage into <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the meane time newes came to <hi>Rome</hi> of that which had beene spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and done at <hi>Carthage,</hi> by the Embassadours, and that <hi>Hannibal</hi>
had past the Riuer of <hi>Ebro</hi> with his Army, much sooner then they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
making hast to go into <hi>Italy;</hi> for the which the great men of

            <p>The which the <hi>Barbarians</hi> seeing, they came out of their Fort, and
runne vnto the shore in a great throng and without order, as if they

the which the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> seeing, they laboured with all their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer

the <hi>Gaules</hi> endeauouring with great fury to ressist them, crying, and

the Combat horrible to see. All the <hi>Gaules</hi> were run downe vnto the

the others were no lesse attentiue in the Combate. When
<hi>Hannibal</hi> saw his enterprize succeed so happily, he incourageth his

            <p>When as <hi>Hannibal</hi> had at one instant, vanquished the Riuer and

being all past in a short time, he planted his Campe without feare of

were ready and prepared. Finally, that they should lay the burthen of
affaires vpon him, shewing only their Obedience, where it should
be needfull, with a remembrance of his Vertue and Prowesse, which
he had performed with so great resolution. His speech being ended,
seeing the ioyfull Countenance of his men, carrying the shew of reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,

            <p>The Company was scarce dismist when as the <hi>Numidians,</hi> who as

the <hi>Roman</hi> Cauallery, whom <hi>Scipio</hi> had sent for the same cause, they
charged one another with such fury, as there were slaine seauen score

he could possible to passe the Elephants: For the effecting
whereof hee tooke this aduice. Hee made prouision of many floats,
and tied two together from the Land vnto the Riuer, being fifty foote
broade:<note place="margin">The meanes to passe the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants.</note> to the which they added two others on the side of the
Bankes: The which they tied fast vnto Trees which were vpon the
Bankes, to the end they might swimme safely: their length being
of two hundred foote.</p>
            <p>Finally, they tied vnto these last two other long floats gently, to
the end they might bee easily vntied: to the which were fastned cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Cords, wherewith they might drawe the Boats to the other
Banke, after they should bee vntied from the other floats. Finally,
they couered them all with Earth, to the end that the Elephants
might march vpon them without feare as vpon the Land. This E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage
being prepared, they brought the Elephants, who had beene
accustomed to obey the <hi>Indians</hi> in all places, but vpon the water, by

water, they made some shew of affrightment, for the feare which
they had of all parts, for that the last fled from the water:<note place="margin">The feare of the Elephants vpon the <hi>Rhone.</hi>
               </note> yet this feare

When the first were past, they went to fetch the rest, and past them.
Some of them tormenting themselues with feare, fell into the Riuer, and
were retired safe, although their Masters were slaine: For in march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of their greatnesse they had their Tronks alwaies aboue the Riuer,
wherewith they might cast out the water if they had drunke any: and so

            <p>The Elephants being past, <hi>Hannibal</hi> marcheth with them, and all

            <p>Some Historiographers seeking in this passage to terrifie the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Readers, doe not obserue that they fall into two strange er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
contrary to the reason of the History: For they are forced to
write lies, and actions quite contrary: shewing <hi>Hannibal</hi> (whom
they will haue inimitable, as well for his knowledge in Martiall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
as for his great courage) to be wholly voide of sense and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
And in the end when they cannot free themselues from their lies,
they haue recourse vnto the gods, for their History made at pleasure.
For in making the passage of the <hi>Alpes</hi> so great and difficult, so as not
onely the Horse-men, Baggage, nor Elephants could not passe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet the Foot men lightly armed; and that moreouer, there is so
great a Desart, that if God, or some Angell had not guided the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
without doubt it had perished in the Caues and hollow places;
they fall directly into two errours. First, where should you finde a
Commaunder more sencelesse then <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Polybius</hi> his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Historio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers.</note> who hauing the charge
of so many troupes, and of so great an Army, wherein consisted all
his hope to preuaile in his enterprize, knew neither the passages, nor
the places, as they say, nor which way hee should passe, nor against
whom? For their meaning is, that with so great a hope, and with such
a triumphant Army, he should doe that which others after many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats
doe not attempt, but through extreame despaire. But what can
be spoken more vnreasonable? And whereas they say the places are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart
and rough, they shew themselues apparent liars. They doe not
say how the <hi>Gaules</hi> inhabiting the banks of <hi>Rhone,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Gaules</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting along the <hi>Rhone</hi> haue often past into <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </note> before that time
haue past into <hi>Italy,</hi> not once nor twice: Nor how in times past, they
haue past the Mountaines with a great Army against the <hi>Romans,</hi> to
succour and helpe the <hi>Cisalphin Gaules:</hi> nor how that those Mountaines
are very well peopled: But as men ignorant hereof, they say,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:16537:73"/>
that I know not what God appeared to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and shewed him
the way. By this meanes they seeme rather <hi>Tragedians</hi> than Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers.
For euen as they which write Tragedies, doe many
time their Playes with the gods, or some other inuention, for that
they haue taken a false and strange beginning: Euen so these kinde
of Historiographers are in the like paine: For that taking false begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
they are forced to fly to some gods, or Heroes.</p>
            <p>But how can it bee that from a false beginning the end should bee
true? Without doubt <hi>Hannibal</hi> hath not carried himselfe as they
imagine, but contrariwise like a wise and politique Captaine, for
hee duely considered the fertility of the Countrey whither hee went,
and the hatred of the Inhabitants against the <hi>Romans.</hi> And he had
to passe the Mountaines (which is a hard and difficult thing) the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Countrey for his guides,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by guides at the passage of the Mountaines.</note> whom he had already wonne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

take that Countrey to passe into <hi>Italy,</hi> as well for the difficulty
of the way, as for the multitude of <hi>Barbarians</hi> which held it. But
after he had well waighed the great courage of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
he presently recouers his ship, and drawes his Army together: Then
he sends his Brother into <hi>Spaine</hi> with part of his men, to the end
it should not be vnfurnished of Forces, and himselfe takes his course

two Brothers in quarrell for the Kingdome, and their Armies fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
one another. But being called by the eldest, and increased to
restore him to his Fathers inheritance, he obeyed him, thinking it
would assist him much in his Enterprize. And when hee had chased
away the younger, and put him in possession of his Realme, hee
had not onely store of victuals, and abundance of all things for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence:
But moreouer they were furnished with all sorts of Armes
and other furniture, whereof the roughnesse of the cold Mountaines
forced him to make prouision. His Army, and himselfe were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
conducted safely by the King and his forces, through the <hi>Sauoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
Countrey vnto the Mountaines, which was a great benefit to him.</p>

he was in great danger. It is true, that whilest the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> past
the Plaine, the Lords of <hi>Sanuoy</hi> suffered them to goe on quietly, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fearing their Horse-men and partly the <hi>Gaules</hi> forces, which did
accompany them.</p>
            <p>But when as they were retired to their houses, and that the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi>
began to ascend the rough and steepe Mountaines: then they
drew together in great multitudes, and seiz'd vpon the passages, by the
which <hi>Hannibal</hi> must of necessity goe. And if they had layed seatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ambushes in the (Valleyes),<note place="margin">The <hi>Sauyards</hi> hindet <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> and had charg'd them suddainly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt they had made a great slaughter of the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> But
being discouered by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> they did not so much annoy the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
as themselues: For when he found that they held all the passages,
he causeth his Army to stay, and lodging among the Rocks and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
places, he sent some no the <hi>Gaules</hi> that were with him, to visite the
places, and to discouer the Enemies intention and and preparations.
Being aduertised by them, that the Enemy stayed there onely in the
day, and that by night euery man retired to his house, to a Towne
which was neere by, he vsed this inuention. At the breake of day hee
recouers the Hills with his whole Army,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibals</hi> pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy:</note> as if he had an intent to force
through the Enemy. But when he was neere vnto them, he setled
his Campe, and fortified himselfe.</p>
            <p>And when hee found the Villains of the Mountaines had retired
themselues from their Hills, he makes many fires in his Campe, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the greatest part of his Army there, and steales through the
streights with the best and ablest men of his Army, staying vpon those
Hills which the Enemy formerly held. This done when the Villaines
of the Mountaines saw, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the breake of day, they made a stand for
a time: But finding that the baggage and the multitude of Horse-men
disordered the Army in the streights: thinking likewise that the least a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement
were sufficient to defeated them, they charge them in diuers
places by the inaccessible Rocks. Then the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were not so
much annoyed by the Enemy, as by the difficulty of the place: for that
the Horses and baggage made a great spoile of men and goods:<note place="margin">They of the Mountaines charge the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians.</hi>
               </note> For
as the streights were of either side sleepe and like a Gulfe, many Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
fell with their burthens a wonderfull height. The Horses being
strucke or hurt, were wonderfully troubled, the way being narrow,
falling partly for feare, and partly for the griefe of their hurts. The
which <hi>Hannibal</hi> seeing, and thatthere was no hope in flight, after the
losse of his baggage, he descends with great fury from the place
where he had remained all night. And although he gaue a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feate

            <p>Finally, after that the <hi>Sau. yards</hi> had beene slaine, some in fighting,
and some in the route: <hi>Hannibal</hi> past the rest of his Horse and baggage
with great paine and trouble. And hauing drawne together the rest of
his Army, hee marcht to the Citty from whence the <hi>Sauoyards</hi> had
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:16537:74"/>
sallied, the which he tooke without resistance, finding no man in it.
It was a great reliefe vnto him for all things necessary, not onely for
the present but for the future: for he carried away a great number of
Horses and Prisoners; and victualled his Army for three daies with
Corne and Cattell: Amazing the other Inhabitants of the mountaines,
who durst not make the like attempt: Which was a thing more to be
esteemed.</p>
            <p>He staied there one day, and parting with his Army, he march't
but little the two daies following, and on the fourth he was againe in
great danger. He was come vnto a place among the Mountaines very

did not thinke it fit to giue credit easily vnto them, and inquires
what their will and intent was: Who answered, that they did like well
of the taking of the Towne and the defeate of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> who were
Enemies vnto them: And as for themselues they would obey his will,
and would not do, nor suffer any ourrage; promising to giue him Hosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
for the assurance of their promises. And although that <hi>Hannibal</hi>
was long in suspence what to do, yet he considered that he might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
pacifie the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> if he accepted these Conditions, and if
he refused them, they would declare themselues his Enemies. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in giuing them a gracious answer, he makes shew to receiue their

            <p>And when they had not only giuen him Hostages, but furnished
him with abundance of Victuals,<note place="margin">The Treason of the Barbarians against <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal.</hi>
               </note> and put themselues into his hands:
<hi>Hannibal</hi> had so great Confidence in them, as he made no doubt but
to make vse of them for Guides in difficult places. When they had
marcht two daies, and were come vnto a streight Valley, hauing the
Mountaine on one side, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were in danger to be wholy
defeated: For that the <hi>Barbarians</hi> fallied from all sides out of their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bushes.
If <hi>Hannibal</hi> (who had not yet so great confidence in the
<hi>Gaules,</hi> and who fore-saw future things,) had not put the Elephants
and Horse-men in the foreward, and had followed in the Reare with
the force of his foot-men, hauing an Eie ouer all. By this supply the
losse proou'd the lesse; yet it was great both of Men, Horses, and Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage:
for the danger was so great, as <hi>Hannibal</hi> was inforced to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
a whole night there with halfe his Army, without his Cauallery
of Baggage: For that the Enemy held the top of the Mountaine, which
was very neere vnto them, rolling downe pieces of the Rocke into
the Army, and sometimes casting stones.</p>
            <p>The day following, when the <hi>Gaules</hi> began to grow cold, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
the Mountaine, ioyning with his Horse and Baggage: Then
the <hi>Gaules</hi> presented themselues no more to Battell, charging like
Theeues, sometimes in the foreward, sometimes in the Reare, as
time and place gaue them opportunity. The Elephants were very vse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> for wheresoeuer they marcht, the place was
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:16537:75"/>
assured from Enemies, for that they durst not approach neere them,
hauing not bin accustomed vnto them. On the ninth day they came
vnto the top of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and there they planted their Campe two
daies, partly to refresh the Souldiers which were weary with toile,
and partly to retire those that were straied. During which time, many
Horses freed from their burthens, and following the Rout of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
recouered the Campe. Those places were then full of Snow, for
it was in <hi>Nouember:</hi> Whereby the Souldiers grew in a manner into
despaire, being tired and vext with so many Crosses. The which
<hi>Hannibal</hi> perceiuing, he draws them together, resoluing to make a
Speech vnto them.</p>
            <p>For the effecting whereof he had but one occasion, which was to
shew them <hi>Italy</hi> so neere,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hanibal</hi> makes a Speech vnto his souldiers.</note> and the fertillity thereof. In truth it is so
neere the foot of the Mountaines, as if it be well obserued, the Hils
seeme to serue as Rampiers to <hi>Italy.</hi> And therefore he shewed it them
from a high Hill, from whence they might see the whole Extent. The
like he did of the plaines about <hi>Poe,</hi> lying at the foot of the Mountains,
relating vnto them the friendship of the <hi>Gaules</hi> inhabiting those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and the Territory of <hi>Rome:</hi> wherewith he reuiued their spirits.
Three dayes after he began to dislodge, the Enemy making no attempt
against them, but after a Theeuing manner: Yet he had no lesse losse
at the descent of the Mountaines by reason of the bad Country, and
the coldnesse of the Snow, then he had at the ascent by the attempt of
his Enemies: For they which did stumble in any sort, fell presently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Gulfe, considering that the place was narrow and rough by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
And all the Country newly couered with Snow, so as there was
no shew of any path, neither could they hold their footing. It is true
the men accustomed vnto so many miseries, did easily indure this
Trouble.</p>
            <p>In the meane time they came to another Rocke, where as neither
the Elephants nor Horse could passe: for a late fall of the ground, had
streightned the Way two hundred paces, which had formerly bin as
large. Here againe the Army began to be troubled and tormented.
<hi>Hannibal</hi> in the beginning laboured to lead his Army by vncough and
vnknowne places, whereas neuer soule had bin: But for that the Snow
hindred them that they could not passe, he desisted from his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.
There had Snow fallen newly this yeare vpon the old,
which was yet whole and entire, vpon the which they had firme foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
for that which was newly fallen was soft and not very thicke.
But after that it had bin trodden and beaten by so many men and horses,
no man could keep his footing: As it happens to those which go vpon
places which are slippery with durt, where their footing failes them:
For that they marcht vpon the Ice, and vpon the Snow that was
moulten.</p>
            <p>Moreouer the men (which was more miserable) falling back-wards
(for that they could not keep their footing in those slippery places) tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
downe into the Caues and hollow places, where they laboured
to rise vpon their Hands and Knees. The Horses of burthen fell some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:16537:75"/>
brake the Ice and could not stirre: for that they were laden
and could not retire their feete out of the Ice. Then <hi>Hannibal</hi> frustrate
of his former hope, for that the men and Horses laboured in vaine,
planted his Campe vpon the top of the Mountaine, hauing cleansed
the place of great difficulty. Then he Commaunded them all to leuile
the way vnto the Rocke where they were to passe: The which was
done with much toile. When as the way was made in one day for
the Horses and Sumpters, he caused them presently to passe, seating
his Campe in those places that were without Snow, and there to feed.
In the meane time he giues charge to the <hi>Numidians,</hi> to make a way
for the Elephants: The which was effected with great difficulty, they
being in a manner dead for hunger; for the tops of the Mountaines are
without Grasse or Trees, for that they are continually couered with
Snow. It is true, that the Vallies of either side of the Mountaines,
hauing goodly Pastures and Trees, and places which are very well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited.</p>
            <p>When as <hi>Hannibal</hi> had drawne all his Troupes together,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> goes on his course.</note> he began
to pursue his course: and hauing past the Rocke aboue mentioned, in
three daies, he came vnto the Plaine, hauing lost the greatest part of
his Army, aswell by the Enemy and Riuers in his way, as by the
roughnesse of the Mountaine in passing them, and not only men, but
also Horses and Carriages. Finally, hauing recouered <hi>Italy</hi> in this
manner, fiue moneths after his departure from <hi>Carthage,</hi> and past the
mountaines in fifteene daies,<note place="margin">The number of men which <hi>Hannibal</hi> had remayning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had past the Alpes.</note> he enters boldly into the Countries about
<hi>Poe</hi> and <hi>Millan,</hi> hauing yet remaining about ten thousand, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
foot <hi>Affricans,</hi> eight thousand <hi>Spanriards,</hi> and sixe thousand
Horse at the most. This he testifies in a pillar where the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of his Army is set downe at <hi>Lauynium.</hi> At the same time <hi>Publius
Cornelius Scipio</hi> the Consull, hauing sent his brother into <hi>Spaine</hi> to
make head against <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> he sail'd to <hi>Pysa</hi> with few men, taking
his way through <hi>Tuscany</hi> where he receiued the Army of the Pretors
<hi>Manlius</hi> and <hi>Attilius,</hi> which they had against the <hi>Bullonois;</hi> and marcht
directly to the Riuer of <hi>Poe,</hi> to fight with the Enemy before he had
refresht himselfe.</p>
            <p>Seeing we haue turn'd our Discourse to the Warre of <hi>Italy,</hi> and to
the Commaunders of these two people, we haue thought it good to
deliuer in few words some things which are not vnfitting for a Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographer,
before we come to those which haue bin acted in that
Prouince. It may be some one will demaund of me how it happens,
that seeing we haue handled the Affaires of <hi>Lybia</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> at large;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Polybius</hi> his Excuse.</note>
yet we haue not spoken of <hi>Hercules</hi> Pillars, nor of that Arme of the
Sea which diuides <hi>Affricke</hi> from <hi>Europe</hi> nor in like manner of the
great Sea or Ocean, nor of those things which depend thereon, nor
of the Ilands of <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor likewise of the abundance of
Tinne, Gold, and Siluer wherewith <hi>Spaine</hi> abounds. It is certaine,
that the auncient Historiographers haue spoken many things and diuers,
being of contrary opinions. It is true we haue not omitted them, as
thinking that they were not fitting for a History, but we haue done it
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:16537:76"/>
to the end that our Relation might not be diuided, nor diuert the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
often from the order of the History: Being of opinion that these
things should be deliuered with all possible truth, in time and place, and
not out of season. And therefore no man ought to maruaile, if in
the following Bookes we passe on, when we shall come to these passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
for we do it of purpose and for the reasons aboue mentioned. If
there be any one that desires to heare them at euery passage, he may
well be compared to a Glutton, that is inuited to a Feast: for as tasting
of all the meates, as soone as he is set at the Table, he shall receiue lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
pleasure or profit for the future, considering that he hath no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
taste, and that all being put together into the Stomacke, it hinders
digestion. They in like manner which do the like in reading of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories,
hauenot pleasure for the present, nor profit for the future. It
is apparent, that a History among other things hath need to be corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in this, aswell for other reasons, as for that the auncient Historio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers,
who haue laboured to describe Countries, and the Nature
of Regions to the remotest parts of the World, haue in many places
straied from the truth.</p>
            <p>Finally, we must speake against them, not by hazard and rashly, but
with reason, nor reprehend their ignorance, but rather to commend
them and correct them: Who no doubt would haue repaired their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
if they had liued in these times. For there are few men found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Grecians,</hi> which in former times could haue gone to search
out the extremities of the World, for the danger and tediousnes of the
way: For that there are many, and in a manner innumerable dangers
at Sea; and if any through necessity, or of his owne free will, had
gone to the extremities of the World, he could not easily haue found out
the scituation of places, nor those things which are worthy to be sought
after: For that the greatest part was inhabited by Barbarous nations,
and some Desart and inhabitable: Besides that, for the diuersity of
Tongues, the enterprize was much more difficult; for there was no
meanes to inquire, nor to learne, for want of vnderstanding one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
It was no lesse difficult to relate truly those things which they
had seene, for that euery man was giuen to augment, and to make
things seeme more admirable.</p>
            <p>Seeing then it was not only difficult, but in a manner impossible, to
haue a true History of these things before this time, we must not blame
the auncient Historiographers, if they haue forgotten or committed
some Errours; but rather we ought to wonder and commend them that
they haue bin able to make any search. It wilbe therefore necessary to
make a true and diligent search of those things, which our Predecessors
knew not: for that in our times all the passages are open, aswell by Sea
as Land, by the meanes of <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> his Forces into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi>
and of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire ouer the rest of the World: And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
when as people were no more troubled with Warre, nor with
any desire or ambition of publicke Affaires: So as they had great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to search out the truth of these things. For the effecting
whereof we will striue by all meanes, as soone as we shall find an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:16537:76"/>
There is nothing that was more pleasing vnto me, then to know
that they which desire to vnderstand these things, come vnto the
truth by our meanes, and that wee haue not taken so much paines,
nor vndergone so great dangers, to visite <hi>Affricke,</hi>

are in <hi>Italy,</hi> betwixt the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee haue formerly related the number of men which <hi>Hannibal</hi>
had remaining after hee had past into <hi>Italy,</hi> who planted his Campe
at the foote of the Mountaines to refresh his Army: for it was toi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and wearied, not onely with the passage of the Mountains which
was very difficult, but also for want of victuals: Besides, it was
continually afflicted with diseases, misery and pouerty: The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part were dead of famine, and their insupportable toile:<note place="margin">Miseries com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among Souldiers.</note> for
it was impossible to carry things necessary for so great an Army, in
a Countrey that was rough and difficult: And if they carried any
thing, the greatest part was lost with the Horses.</p>
            <p>By this meanes it fell out, that although a little before hee had
parted from the Riuer of <hi>Rhone</hi> with thirty eight thousand Foote,
and eight thousand Horse,<note place="margin">A decrease of <hi>Hannibals</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> hee had scarce then halfe his Army en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire:
and yet by the reason of their continuall labour and toile, they
were in a manner become wilde. The which <hi>Hannibal</hi> perceiuing,
hee not onely laboured to cheere vp the bodies and hearts of the
Souldiers, but likewise to refresh their Horses. After which hee
marched with his Army, and laboured by all meanes to procure
the Friendship of the <hi>Turinois,</hi> which was the neerest Nation, and
were at that time in Warre with the <hi>Millanois,</hi> and seemed to
haue no great trust and confidence in the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> Who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
not much to regard him, hee assaults one of their strongest
Townes, the which hee takes vpon the third day: where put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all vnto the Sword that would not follow his party, hee so
terrified and amazed the <hi>Barbarians</hi> which inhabited there-abouts,
as presently they yeelded themselues into the hands of the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true that the other <hi>Gaules</hi> inhabiting along the Riuer of <hi>Poe,</hi>
would willingly haue ioyned to <hi>Hannibal</hi> as they had resolued, if at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
an opportunitie to doe it, the suddaine comming of the
Consull had not preuented them. So as they stirred not, and some
of them ioyned to the <hi>Roman</hi> Army. The which <hi>Hannibal</hi> perceiuing,
he resolued to make no longer stay, and that he must attempt some good
enterprize, to make the rest more bold to follow his partie. Being care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
hereof, he had newes that <hi>Publius Scipio</hi> had past the <hi>Poe,</hi> and that
he was not farre off: the which at the first he seemed not to regard, as a
thing not likely: For he remembred that hee had lately left him at
the mouth of <hi>Rhone,</hi> and vnderstood that the passage from <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seilles</hi>
vnto <hi>Tuscany</hi> was long and inaccessible, and the way from
the <hi>Tuscan</hi> Sea which leades to the <hi>Alpas</hi> through <hi>Italy,</hi> was rough,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:16537:77"/>
where an Army could not passe. But vpon diuers aduertisements of
the certaine newes hee was amazed, wondring, much at the Consuls
industry and diligence. The Consull in like manner wondred no lesse.
For where as he thought that <hi>Hannibal</hi> would neuer presume to passe
the Mountaines with an Army consisting of strange Nations: And
that if hee attempted it, hee would dye by the way, hee wondred
much at his great courage and boldnesse, when as hee found that
hee had not onely past safely, but had also forced some Townes of
<hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the same time the <hi>Romans</hi> were full of affaires. It is true, that
the last newes they had receiued, was of the taking of <hi>Sagont:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they called an assembly and made choice of two Consuls,<note place="margin">The <hi>Romans</hi> aduertised of <hi>Hannibals</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent into <hi>Italy</hi>

the one was sent into <hi>Affricke</hi> to make Warre against <hi>Carthage,</hi>
and the other into <hi>Spaine</hi> against <hi>Hannibal.</hi> But when they had sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
newes of the comming of <hi>Hannibals</hi> Army, and that he held
some Townes of <hi>Italy</hi> besieged: they were so amazed, as they
presently countermaunded <hi>Sempronius</hi> from <hi>Lybia,</hi> aduertising him
of the descent of the Enemy into <hi>Italy,</hi> and that leauing the affaires
of the Prouince, he should make hast to succour his Countrey. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which newes, <hi>Sempronius</hi> presently sends backe the Army by
Sea, giuing them charge to saile directly to <hi>Italy,</hi> and he gaue the
conduct of the Army by Land to the Tribunes, appointing them
a day when they should come to <hi>Rimeny.</hi> It is a Towne seated vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Adriatique shore, at the end of the Plaines which are about
<hi>Poe</hi> towards the South. By this meanes matters being altred, and
that all seemed to fall out contrary to the hope and opinion of the
World, euery man vsed diligence to prouide for the future. The
two Armies were now opposite one to another, whereof the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunders
for the time they had, laboured to giue courage vnto
their men.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Hannibal</hi> striuing to encourage them vsed this meanes, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
into the middest of the Army assembled together the Prisoners of
the Mountaines, who were in Chaines: The which by their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
toile, and partly by his commaundment were growne leane
and feeble: for (the better to attaine vnto his intention) hee had
caused them to haue great fetters,<note place="margin">The <hi>policy</hi> of <hi>Hannibal</hi> for an example to his Souldiers.</note> and had in a manner starued them,
and finally, had commaunded that they should bee cruelly beaten
naked.</p>
            <p>Hauing drawne them into the midst of his Army, he caused armes
to be laid before them after the manner of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> and such as Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
vse to arme themselues with when they fight single Combats:
he also gaue them Horses, and Cassocks made with great Art. Then
he demaunded of the Prisoners, which of them would fight man to
man, propounding to the Victor the afore said gifts, and to the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished
that by death he should be freed from his present miseries. And
as they all cried out that they were ready to fight, <hi>Hannibal</hi> causeth Lots
to be cast, and makes two men to enter the list arm'd, vpon whom the
Lot had fallen. The which the prisoners hearing, they lifted vp
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:16537:77"/>
their hands to Heauen, praying vnto the gods, that they would bee
pleased to choose them for the Combate. As soone as the Lot was
cast, they vpon whom it fell, were wonderfully ioyfull, and the
rest remained sad and pensiue. But when as the Combate was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
the other Prisoners did no lesse commend the fortune of him
that was defeated, then of the Conqueror: Conceiuing that hee
was freed from the great and many miseries, wherewith they were tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
liuing. The like thought the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> for in making
comparison of the misery of the suruiuours, and of those who fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
died valiantly, they found the fortune of these men good, and that
of the others moued them to pitty.</p>
            <p>When as <hi>Hannibal</hi> saw his Army moued to pitty at this spectacle,
he presently came into the midst of the assembly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibals</hi> speech to his Souldiers.</note> saying, that hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
it vnto them, to the end they should make vse of the example
of anothers mans fortune, to consider of their owne: for that they
were to vndergoe the same Combate, and that Fortune propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vnto them the like time, and the like rewards: for they must of
necessity liue or dye, or fall into their Enemies hands aliue. If they
vanquished, their spoile should bee more then a Horse or a Cassocke,
being the happiest men in the World, after they had conquered the
good fortune of the <hi>Romans.</hi> And if in fighting they died like braue
men, they should end their liues with good hope, free from all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
and calamities: But withall they must expect all miseries and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty,
if being vanquished, they should flie, with a desire of a longer
life, or with a resolution to seeke some other meanes to liue: and
that there is no man so voide of sence, which thinkes (if hee flies)
that his safe returne into his Countrey is possible, if hee will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the length of the way, with the multitude of Combats which
must bee maintained during the Voyage: If hee likewise considers the
narrow streights, and so many troublesome Riuers which were to passe.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it was needfull for them, that in laying aside all hope of
flight, they should vse the like pitty to themselues in their affaires, as
they haue shewed lately in the example of other mens fortunes: For
as in the others they commended the fortune of the Victor and the
vanquished, and held those which remained miserable: so they must
iudge the like of themselues. And therefore they must goe resolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Combate, to get an vnspeakable Victory; or else to dye like
braue men in battell, if auerse fortune deny it them: and that they must
not expect that being vanquished, they should finde any meanes of
safety.</p>
            <p>Finally, if they march to the field with this resolution, there is
no doubt but the Victory and their safety is in their owne hands: for
there was neuer any man that haue fought with this intention, or with
a resolute courage, or forced by necessity, but hee hath preuailed
ouer his Enemies. And that this is very easie to doe, when as
all these things concurre together contrary vnto the Enemy, as it
happens this Day vnto the <hi>Romans:</hi> For as their flight hath a
manifest and an apparent safety in their houses which were neere them,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:16537:78"/>
so the courage of desperate men will be found insupportable. And
when as after this Oration (together with the example) the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
hearts were much inflamed to Warre, and that their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
comparison was pleasing vnto them, <hi>Hannibal</hi> commending
them, sent them away, and commaunded them to bee ready at the
breake of day.</p>
            <p>But after that the Consull <hi>Publiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

caused his Army to march to the Riuer of <hi>Tesin,</hi> he commaunded a
Bridge to be made by such as were skilfull, and made a Speech vnto
the assembly according to the opportunity of the time. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
he spake many things concerning the Maiesty of the people of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and the prowesse of their Ancestors: But concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
affaires, this was the substance. They must of necessity (sayd he)
hold the victory certaine.<note place="margin">

                  </gap>en.</note> although they had not yet tried their val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
with the Enemy: But onely for that they were to fight with the
<hi>Carthaginians.</hi> Neither must they expect that they would dare to
come to Battell against the <hi>Romans,</hi> hauing in the last Warres so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
beate them both by Sea and Land, to whom they had also so long
payed tribute: and whose power they had so often tried. And to the
end I forbeare to speake of the times past, why should men of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
doubt of the future, seeing we haue some experience, that they
dare not looke vs in the face?</p>
            <p>It is certaine that when lately the <hi>Roman</hi> Horse-men encountred the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> in <hi>Gaule,</hi> on this side the Riuer of <hi>Rhone,</hi> they not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
returned safe, but they beate them backe into their Campe: and
that presently, when as <hi>Hannibal</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Army found the
<hi>Romans</hi> to be so neere, they steale away in manner of a flight, and passe
the Mountaines otherwise then they had resolued, in feare and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Now behold <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who in passing the <hi>Alpes,</hi> hath lost two
parts of his Forces. And the rest is so tired and broken with toile, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
cold, and pouerty, as they can hardly support themselues: and the
remainder of his Horses (if any be escaped) are so worne with labour,
and the tedious wayes, as they could not make vse of them. Finally,
it sufficed the <hi>Romans</hi> onely to present themselues, and that moreouer,
his presence should with reason make them more resolute, seeing that
he had not left the Army at Sea, nor the affaires of <hi>Spaine,</hi> nor had
not transported himselfe thither with such speed, going so great a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuite
both by Sea and Land, if he had not knowne it necessary for the
Countrey, and the victory to be certaine. The Army being inflamed
with this Speech, and making shew of a resolution to fight, <hi>Scipio</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
their good will, sent them away, and gaue them charge to
feed, and to be ready, and in Armes at the sound of the Trumpet and
Drumme.</p>
            <p>Three daies after, the two Commaunders marcht with their Army
along the Riuer, on the side of the Mountaines. The <hi>Romans</hi> had the
left hand, and the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> the right. And when as the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
they were aduertised by their Spies of their approach one vnto
another, they stayed. The third day after, the two Commaunders
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:16537:78"/>
fronted one another with all their Horse, <hi>Scipio</hi> being moreouer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with men that cast Darts, chosen out of the bands of foot-men:
The which they did to discouer the number of the men, and
what they were.</p>
            <p>But when they came to affront one another, and the dust beginning
to rise by reason of the Horses, they presently prepared themselues to
Battell: <hi>Scipio</hi> puts in Front the Gaulish horse-men, with those that
Darts, and appointed the rest to second them marching a slow pace.
In regard of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> he makes his point of the strongest of his horse-men,
and presents it to the Enemy, casting the <hi>Numidians</hi> vpon the
Wings. But when the two Armies began to enter the Combat furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
they had scarce begun the Crie but the Darters fled, without
any fight,<note place="margin">A Combat of the Horse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Scipio.</hi>
               </note> and passing through their supplies, they recouered the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell.
They were in truth amazed at the violent charge, fearing to be
ouerthrowne by the encounter of the Horse-men. In the meane time
the Combat was great betwixt the Horse-men; for both the one and
the other fought with great courage; which made the Battell to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
long in suspence. There was fighting both on horse-backe and on
foot, for that many had left their horses in the Battell. And when as
the <hi>Numidians</hi> in turning about, had fallen vpon the reare of the Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
who in the beginning had fled from the fury of the Horse-men,
they were inuironed by them, and defeated in great Troupes. They
also which fought with the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Horse-men, after they had
receiued great losse of their men, and slaine many of their Enemies, in
the end they gaue backe, for that the <hi>Numidians</hi> charged in the reare.
Some were dispersed here and there: others retired to the Campe in a
throng, sauing the Consull (who was wounded) in the middest of the
Troupe, from thence <hi>Scipio</hi> Commaunded his men to follow him
without noise,<note place="margin">The retreate of <hi>Scipio.</hi>
               </note> and marcheth with his Army to the Bridge which he
had made vpon the <hi>Poe,</hi> there to passe without tumult or danger; but
when he saw the fields about the <hi>Poe</hi> so great and spacious, and that the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> were stronger in horses, and being moreouer troubled
with the Wound which he had receiued, he held it the safest course to
passe his Army before the Enemy should pursue him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> made his account that the <hi>Romans</hi> would fight sometime
with their foot-men, but when he was aduertised of their flight, and
that abandoning their Fort they had past the <hi>Poe,</hi> by a Bridge which
they had made, he pursues them with speed. The end of the Bridge
was already broken and the guard was yet remaining; of the which he
presently tooke about sixe hundred. <hi>Hannibal</hi> aduertised that the rest
of the Army was not farre off, hee returnes to his Fort, seeking care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
for a place fit to make a Bridge: The which two daies after he
found with great difficulty, and then effected it, ioyning many floats
together. Afterwards he gaue the Charge to <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> to passe the
Army, whilst that he busied himselfe to heare the Embassie of the
<hi>Gaules,</hi> which were come vnto him from diuers neighbour Countries:
For as soone as it was bruted that the <hi>Romans</hi> had bin defeated by the
<hi>Carthaginians,</hi> all the neighbour <hi>Gaules</hi> made hast to ioyne with <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:16537:79"/>
as they had formerly resolued, and to giue him succours, and to
go to the Warre. After he had giuen them a good reception, he past
his Army beyond the <hi>Poe,</hi> and takes his way along the Riuer, hoping
more easily to ouer-take the Enemy. When as <hi>Scipio</hi> had led his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to <hi>Plaisence,</hi> (which was a <hi>Roman</hi> Collony) he had a care to cure
those that were Wounded, and thinke of a place whither he might
lead his Army.</p>
            <p>The third day after that <hi>Hannibal</hi> had past the <hi>Poe,</hi> he puts his men
in order before <hi>Plaisence</hi> in view of the Enemies, and presented them
Battell. And when as no man offered himselfe, he Camp'd hauing
found a conuenient place within sixe miles of them. The <hi>Gaules</hi> who
had come to succour <hi>Scipio,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The treason of the <hi>Gaules</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
               </note> seeing better hopes with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
resolued among themselues to abandon the <hi>Romans.</hi> And when at
mid-night they found all men asleep, they being in Armes in their
Tents, they part, and kill'd most of the <hi>Romans</hi> they met in their way,
cutting off some of their heads. Finally they retired to the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
to the number of two thousand foot, and two hundred Horse.
Being graciously receiued, and inflamed with hope of good, <hi>Hannibal</hi>
sends them home to their Houses; to the end they might make those
things knowne, and induce their Country to seeke the Alliance of the
<hi>Carthaginians.</hi> He saw plainly, that of necessiy they would leaue
the <hi>Roman</hi> party, considering the foule crime which their men had
committed. Moreouer there was an Embassie come from the <hi>Boloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">An Embassie from the <hi>Bolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> to <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal.</hi>
               </note>
deliuering vnto <hi>Hannibal</hi> the Triumviry who (as wee haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
said) had bin sent by the <hi>Romans</hi> to diuide the Lands being taken
by Treason.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> commending their good affection, makes an Alliance with
them, and restores vnto them the Triumviry, to serue them as a
meanes to retire their Hostages, as they had formerly resolued. <hi>Scipio</hi>
being troubled, not so much for the Treason of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> and the
slaughter of his men, but for that he fore-saw that all the <hi>Gaules</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
(which had bin a long time Enemy vnto the <hi>Romans</hi>) would reuolt,
which made him study how to giue order in time for his Affaires.
Wherefore the night following about the breake of day, he dislodg'd
without noise,<note place="margin">The Riuer of <hi>Trebia.</hi>
               </note> and seated his Campe neere vnto the Riuer of <hi>Trebia,</hi>
on the highest Hils of the Country, relying vpon the scituation of the
place, and the multitude of their Allies inhabiting thereabouts. <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
being aduertised of his Enemies flight, he causeth the <hi>Numidians</hi>
to march first, and then all the Cauallery, and soone after he follows
with the rest of his Army.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Numidians</hi> turning to the Campe abandoned by their Enemies,
they set it on fire, to the great benefit of the <hi>Romans:</hi> For if they had
not staied in the Campe, they might haue pursued them in the Reare,
and haue made a great slaughter of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army. But whilst they
loose time in burning the lodging, the greatest part of the Army past
the Riuer in safety: Some of the Reare-ward were surprized by the
<hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who were either slaine or taken Prisoners. In the
meane time <hi>Scipio</hi> made choise of the Hils, which were neere vnto the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:16537:79"/>
Riuer, for that they seemed fit to make a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ort. The which being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed
with a Ditch and a Pallisado, hee attended in this distresse the
returne of his Companion <hi>Tyberius</hi> from <hi>Sycily</hi> with an Army: causing
his Wounds to be carefully looked vnto, to the end that their assailes
being in so great danger, he might be a pertaker. <hi>Hannibal seated his</hi>
Campe, within fiue miles of the Enemies Fort, whom the <hi>Gaules</hi> did
furnish abundantly, not only with Victuals, but with all other things
necessary, and were very ready to vndergoe any danger with the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The newes came to <hi>Rome</hi> of the defeate of their men. And although
they would neuer haue thought it, yet the <hi>Romans</hi> made no shew to
be amazed therewith, disguising the defeate of their Horse-men to
haue hapned, not so much by the Prow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>sse of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> as
by the ouer-weening of the Commaunder, and the Treason of the
<hi>Gaules,</hi> who had yeilded themselues to <hi>Hannibal.</hi> Finally, they were
in good hope of their Warre, seeing that the Bands of foot-men were
yet entire. Wherefore <hi>Sempronius</hi> being returned, and passing by
<hi>Rome,</hi> they all perswaded him publickely to giue Battell to the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians.
Sempronius</hi> at his comming vnto <hi>Rimeny,</hi> receiues all the
Troupes which were come from <hi>Sycily,</hi> according to his commaund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
From thence marching to <hi>Trobia,</hi> he ioynes with his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
where he refresht his Army, toil'd with the rediousnesse of the
way, hauing marcht forty daies together comming from <hi>Lylibeum</hi> to
<hi>Rimeny.</hi> He also vsed diligence to prouide all sorts of munition. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
he consulted with <hi>Scipio,</hi> inquiring of the actions past, and confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the future.</p>
            <p>At the same time <hi>Hannibal</hi> tooke the Towne of <hi>Clastidium</hi> by Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
corrupting <hi>Brengusin</hi> the Captaine of the Garrison,<note place="margin">

               </note> where as the
<hi>Romans</hi> had lodged a great quantity of Corne, whereof he made vse
in his necessity, and sent away the Souldiers in safety; to the end that
by the fame of his Clemency, others might yeild more easily vnto the
<hi>Carthaginians.</hi> He extended his bounty also vnto him that betraide it.
And being aduertised that the <hi>Gaules</hi> inhabiting that little Country
which lies betwixt <hi>Trebia</hi> and the <hi>Poe,</hi> and had made an Alliance with
him, had sought the friendship of the <hi>Romans</hi> by Embassie: To the
end that during the trouble of these two powerfull Nations, they might
haue the grace of an vncertaine fauour: He sends (being mooued with
rage and despight) two thousand foote, and about a thousand <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
Horses, with some <hi>Gaules</hi> intermixt, to spoile the Country. The
which hauing performed and taken a great Booty, the Inhabitants sent
presently an Embassie to the Consull to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>mpronius</hi>
presently imbracing this occasion to giue battell, which hee had long
desired, sends a great part of his Cauallery, with a thousand foote
with Darts, beyond the Riuer of <hi>Trebia,</hi> who charging the <hi>Gaules,</hi>
and surprizing them in disorder,<note place="margin">The <hi>Gaules</hi> Repu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e.</note> for that they were in contention tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the diuision of the Booty, they put them into a great confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and forced them to retire, killing and chasing them into their
Fort: Where by the sally of the Troupe which guarded the Campe,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:16537:80"/>
the <hi>Gaules</hi> resuming Courage, they were forced to turne head, and to
recouer their Campe. The which <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> perceiuing, he sent a
simply of all his Horse with the Darters, and forced the <hi>Gaules</hi> to retire
into their Fort. But for that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was not then ready to giue bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
he was not of aduice to vndertake it without great consideration,
nor to hazard all vpon all occasions. And therefore like a well aduised
Captaine, he caused a Retreateto be sounded, and retires his men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Fort.</p>
            <p>And when as the <hi>Romans</hi> had skirmished with their enemies in vaine,
they returned to their Campe, hauing lost few of their men, and made
great slaughter of the <hi>Carthaginians, Sempronius</hi> growne ioyfull and
proud of this good Fortune, had a will to giue Battell onely for the
desire of glory, whilst that his Companion was weake and infirme.
And therefore he discouers himselfe to <hi>Scipio,</hi> to whom the time did
not seeme conuenient to do it, but rather to deferre the Battell, to the
end that the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers being yet fresh and greene, might gaine
experience, and that in Temporizing, the <hi>Gaules</hi> as people light and
without faith, might abandon the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and that finally he
might be present, for that his Wound at that time made him vnprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
Although that <hi>Sempronius</hi> knew well that <hi>Scipio</hi> spake the truth,
yet mooued with ambition, either that <hi>Scipio</hi> should not be present,
or that the Warre should not be prolonged vntill the comming of the
other Consuls, for that the time of the election was come, he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

            <p>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> being of the like opinion with <hi>Scipio,</hi> was carefull how
to finde an occasion to fight, whilst the <hi>Gaules</hi> faith was firme, and the
Enemies Souldiers of little experience, and <hi>Scipio</hi> vnprofitable to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe
the danger: But especially he feared to loose time: For seeing he
led an Army in a strange Country, and had a great enterprize in hand,
there was no other meanes of safety, then to keepe his Allies. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
seeing the desire of <hi>Sempronius,</hi> he prepared himselfe willingly to
Battell.</p>
            <p>There was betwixt the two Armies a plaine Champaigne, but very
conuenient to lay an Ambush; hauing a deepe Riuer, with high Bankes,
and Thickets and Bushes round about it: Which <hi>Hannibal</hi> hauing
viewed, he resolued to lay an Ambush. It is true, that the <hi>Romans</hi> fled
the Forrests, by reason of the Ambushes which the <hi>Gaules</hi> often layd
for them, trusting onely in a Champaigne Country: Being ignorant
that a plaine is more fitting then a Forrest, for the couering of an
Ambush:<note place="margin">A plaine is sometimes the occasion of an Ambush.</note> For they may see the Enemy come farre off, and haue
sometimes fit meanes and opportunity to couer themselues, so as when

times the Horse-men, if they bend downe their Helmets which are

his resolution to giue battel,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mago</hi> Brother to <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
               </note> and being both of this aduice, he caused him
to be called whilst the Souldiers supp'd: His brother <hi>Mago</hi> was a
young man, of a braue Spirit and Resolute, and had bin alwaies bred
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:16537:80"/>
vp in the Warre. To whom he gaue a thousand Horse, and as many
Boote chosen out of the whole Army, whom he called vnto his Tent
after supper, and made a speech vnto them according to the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the time, declaring vnto them what he had resolued. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
he giues euery one of them charge, to choose out of all the
Troupes nine others like themselues, and that they should repaire to
a certaine place in the Campe. These presently obeyed the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Generall.<note place="margin">An Ambush laid by <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> for the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
               </note> Thus <hi>Mago</hi> accompanied with a thousand
Horse, and as many Foote, and with a guide, came to the place of
his Ambush, being well instructed by <hi>Hannibal</hi> what hee was
to doe.</p>
            <p>At the breake of day <hi>Hannibal</hi> calls the <hi>Numidian</hi> Horse-men able
to beare labour: to whom when he had made a speech, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
great rewards, if they carried themselues like braue men, hee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couers
his Enterprize. Hee giues them charge to passe the Riuer of
<hi>Trebia,</hi> and to runne vnto the Gates of the Enemies Campe, and to
draw them forth to fight with their Darts, desiring much to surprize
them in disorder, and to fight with them before they had taken any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past,
the which he did much esteeme. He also giues charge to all the
other Captaines appointed for the Combate, to feed their men and
their horses, and commands them to be ready armed, attending the
sound of the Trumpet. But when as <hi>Sempronius</hi> saw the Enemy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
he first sent out all his Horse-men, and after them sixe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Darters: Finally, he drawes all his Troupes to field, as if hee
meant that day to make an end of the Warre: and who (for the good
fortune which two daies before hee had in fight, together with the
great number of his men) was in hope to get the Victory. It was
by chance in Winter, and did snow that day with a vehement cold.
Moreouer, the Souldiers were come forth in confusion with the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and had no great heat, neither had they fed. And therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in the beginning they were ready and resolute, yet being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the Riuer, they came forth wet vnto the brest: for that the
show which had fallen in the night, had made the Riuer swell, so as
they began to be so afflicted with cold and hunger, that as the day came
on, they were scarce able to hold their Armes. In the meane time
the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> oyl'd and warm'd themselues at fires neere vnto their
Tents, hauing their Horses ready after they had fed well.</p>
            <p>When as <hi>Hannibal</hi> (who had an eye euery where) saw that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
had past the Riuer, he sets before the Ensignes the stingers of
<hi>Maiorque</hi> and <hi>Minorque,</hi> and those that were lightly armed, to the
number of eight thousand men, and puts the rest of his Army in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> puts his men in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile.</note>
When he had marcht about a Mile, he sets vpon the wings twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

of his Horse-men, who with the Allies that the neighbour Townes of
<hi>Gaule</hi> had sent him, were ten thousand men. After them on either
side were placed the Elephants. Then <hi>Sempronius</hi> caused a retreate
to be sounded, to call backe the Horse-men, lest pursuing the <hi>Nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">

Allies: for when they were to vndergoe any great Warre, and that
the two Consuls were ioyned together, the perfect number of their
Army was of so many thousands. Then hee placed three thousand
Horse-men vpon the wings. When he had thus disposed of his men,
he marcht in battaile a slow pace, scarce mouing.</p>
            <p>The two Armies being neere one vnto the other, those that were
lightly armed began the fight, wherewith the <hi>Romans</hi> were suddainly
opprest. All things fore-told good vnto the <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> for the
bodies of the <hi>Roman</hi> Foote were growne feeble with hunger and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse,
and numm'd with cold: Being moreouer slaine by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Darts which the <hi>Numidians</hi> cast. For their parts they had
abandoned their Darts, as vnprofitable by reason of the continuall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity:
The Horse-men suffred the like with the whole Army. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise
the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> being in their force, in good order and
fresh, were diligent and ready at need. Wherefore when as they had
made way for their forlorne hope to retire, and that the Armies had
charged one another: the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Horse-men fell vpon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
wings, and quite defeated them. It is true, the <hi>Romans</hi> were
weake in their numbers of Horse: and the Souldiers were tired with
labour and hunger.</p>
            <p>After the rout of the Horse-men,<note place="margin">A defeate of the <hi>Roman</hi> Horse-men.</note> the Foote resisted more with the
equality of courage then of force: But the <hi>Numidians</hi> besides the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush
which the Army had past without discouering them, shewing
themselues vpon the Reare, put them in a great amazement, yet the
Battallions stood firme for a time, although they were inuolued with
so many miseries. But in the end when as the two wings were prest, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the Elephants in front, and that those which were lightly armed,
had compassed them in, they fled directly to the neere Riuer. This
done, when as the <hi>Romans</hi> which fought in the battell, saw their sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
broken, they were partly enuironed by them of the Ambush, and
partly defeated and slaine: Others past through the Battalion of the
<hi>Gaules,</hi> where were many <hi>Affricans,</hi> making a great slaughter of the
Enemies. But when as they could neither succour their men, nor get
to their Fort, as well for the multitude of the Enemies Horse, as for
the swelling of the Riuer and the raine, they recouered <hi>Plaisance,</hi> to
the number of ten thousand men: the rest for the most part were
slaine along the Riuer by the Elephants and Horse-men. Some few
Foote and Horse flying dispersed ouer the Fields, drew to <hi>Plaisance,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the route of the Army. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> hauing pursued them
to the Riuer of <hi>Trebeia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Victory of <hi>Mannibal</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
               </note> returned to the Campe, for that they could not
proceed any farther by reason of the raine: being very ioyfull of the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
whereas the losse of <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Affricans</hi> was small, and that of
the <hi>Gaules</hi> great. But they were so tormented with raine &amp; cold that all
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:16537:81"/>
the Elephants except one, and the greatest part of the carriage-hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
with many men and horses died.</p>
            <p>After this action <hi>Sempronius</hi> desirous to couer and conceale so great a

the raine had depriued them of an absolute Victory: the which the
<hi>Romans</hi> did easily beleeue. But when as within few dayes after,
they had newes that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> held their Army in strength,
and that all the <hi>Gaules</hi> held for them, abandoning their party, and
withall that their Army kept the Towne, for that it was not well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
within its Fort, and that they drew victuals from the Sea by
the Riuer of <hi>Poe,</hi> they grew into so great a feare and amazement,
as they thought <hi>Hannibal</hi> would come a Conquerour to <hi>Rome.</hi>
Wherefore they leuied a new Army,<note place="margin">A new Army leuied by the <hi>Romans</hi> both by Sea and Land.</note> and sent supplies into <hi>Sicily</hi>
and <hi>Sardinia,</hi> fortifying <hi>Tarentum</hi> and the other Townes in <hi>Italy.</hi>
They likewise prepared an Army at Sea of fifty Quinqueremes: Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
they were wholly attentiue to Warre.</p>
            <p>At that time <hi>Cneus Seruilius,</hi> and <hi>Caius Flami<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Consuls, and a new leuie of men was made, and succours required
from the Allies. One of them led his Troupes to <hi>Rimeni,</hi> and the
other into <hi>Tuscany.</hi> They had resolued to lead their Armies into
<hi>Gaule.</hi> They had besides sent to <hi>Hieron</hi> to demaund succours, who
sent them fiue hundred <hi>Candiots,</hi> and a thousand men which beare

they could possible against <hi>Hannibal:</hi> for the feare was not onely
generall, but euery mans in particular.</p>
            <p>During these accidents in <hi>Italy, Cneus Cornelius Scipio</hi> (who as

And beginning there, hee made all the <hi>Maritime</hi> Countrly
vnto <hi>Ebro</hi> subiect to the <hi>Romans,</hi> renewing the ancient leagues with
some, and making new with others. When hee had pacifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d the
Sea-coasts, aud had left Garrisons where neede required, he led his
Army vp into the firme land. Hee had now drawne together some
Companies of succours from the allied Townes. By this meanes
he takes some Townes, some by Composition, others by force.
The which <hi>Hanno</hi> perceiuing (whom <hi>Hannibal</hi> had left for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of <hi>Spaine</hi>) he resolued to encounter the Enemies,<note place="margin">Hanno<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and planted
himselfe right against them, neere vnto a Towne which the people
of the Countrey call <hi>Cisse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scipio</hi> in like manner did not hold it fit to deferre the Battell. And
therefore after hee had gotten the Victory, and taken the Enemies
Fort, hee recouered great store of Treasure: For all they which
went to the Warres of <hi>Italy</hi> vnder <hi>Hannibal,</hi> had left all their
wealth with these men, lest the Baggage should bee tedious and
troublesome vnto them. Afterwards <hi>Scipio</hi> made a league with
all the Inhabitants which were within the Riuer of <hi>Ebro,</hi> and
made them Allies and Friends. There were two Commaunders
taken aliue, whereof the one was <hi>Hanno,</hi> who had the leading of the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:16537:82"/>
               <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and the other <hi>Andubal,</hi> King of a Region which

Asdrubal</hi> hearing the newes, passeth <hi>Ebro,</hi> marching
with his Army against the <hi>Romans:</hi> who vpon the way had newes
that the Souldiers and Sea-men wandred the fields vp and downe,
being confident and carelesse with the ioy of their Victory. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

went to winter at <hi>Carthage. Cneus Scipio</hi> aduertised hereof, drawes
his men suddainly together, and goes vnto his Sea-army, punishing
such as had beene the cause of the defeate, after the manner of the
<hi>Romans.</hi> When hee had drawne his Army both by Sea and Land
together, he went to winter at <hi>Taracona,</hi> where he diuided the spoile,
so as hee purchased the loue of them all, making them more reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
for the future Warre. Behold the estate of the affaires of
<hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the beginning of the Spring <hi>Flaminius</hi> marching thorough <hi>Tus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany,</hi>
came to <hi>Aretzo.</hi> As for <hi>Seruilius,</hi> hee attended (after hee
had brought his Army to <hi>Rimeni</hi>) when the Enemy would dislodge.
And whilest that <hi>Hannibal</hi> spent the Winter in <hi>Gaule,</hi> hee kept the
<hi>Romans</hi> that were Prisoners straightly fetter'd, and poorely fed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
the Allies courteously from the beginning: and afterwards
causing them to assemble, he made many remonstrances vnto them,
telling them that he was not come to make Warre against them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibals</hi> speech to the Prisoners that were allied to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </note> but
to fight with the <hi>Romans</hi> for their liberty: and therefore if they were
wise, they should imbrace the alliance and friendship of the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians:</hi>
and that he was there to set the people of <hi>Italy</hi> at liberty,
and to restore those whom the <hi>Romans</hi> had outragiously chased from
their houses, their Townes, and Countries. When hee had vsed
these, or the like speeches, hee sent them all away without ransome,
desiring by this meanes to winne the hearts of all the people of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
and to make them abandon the <hi>Romans</hi> party, and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
those whom they had depriued of their Townes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
It is true, that whilest hee wintred, he was many times in
dangers by the <hi>Gaules,</hi> the which he preuented by an <hi>Affrican</hi> tricke,

their consent: so as hee caused periwigges of diuers ages to bee
made with great art, the which he vsed, changing his apparrell of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:
so as he was not onely vnknowne to them which had neuer
seene him, but also to his familiars. By this meanes he was in
safety, they not knowing whom to assault for <hi>Hannibal.</hi> Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
when as the <hi>Gaules</hi> were discontented, that their Countrey was
made the seate of the Warre, making a shew to be desirous to fight,
to the end it might be transported to some other part, <hi>Hannibal</hi> resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to goe the sooner to field, and to lead his Army to the Warre
which he desired.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:16537:82"/>
The Spring time approached, when calling vnto him those which
knew the wayes, he inquired of the passages, which went into the
Enemies Country. And being aduertised that all the wayes were long
and knowne to the enemy, they discouered vnto him one that was
shorter, but troublesome, which would leade him through the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> whereby he might passe his Army, vnknowne vnto
the enemy: But when the newes came into the Campe of their Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
by Marishes, the apprehension discouraged them,<note place="margin">The Way and Order which <hi>Hannibal</hi> held to passe into <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </note> fearing the
Quagmires and Pooles. Yet he tooke this way with his whole Army,
causing the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Affricans</hi> to march before, with the ablest
of his men and their Baggage, to the end that if they were forced to
plant a Campe, they should not want things necessary. It is true, that
before, he had not resolued to carry any Baggage, for that hee knew
well that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> should not want any thing if they were van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished;
and if they won the Countrey they should not likewise want.
Next he causeth the <hi>Gaules</hi> to march, and in the Reare the horse-men,
whereof he gaue the charge to his brother <hi>Mago,</hi> to the end that by
their helpe, the <hi>Gaules</hi> by their basenesse should not turne head, being
discontented with the toile. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Affricans</hi> marching
through the Marishes, came vnto the end without any great toile, as
inured to paines, and accustomed to such miseries. Contrariwise the
<hi>Gaules</hi> went with great difficulty, as men amazed, falling into the
Quagmires of the Moares, and carrying this misery with griefe and
discontent, like men vnaccustomed to such calamities, the Horse-men
kept them from returning.</p>
            <p>Finally the whole Army was in great trouble and paine; and they
languished the more, for that they had watch'd foure daies and three
nights, going through the Waters. But amongst all the rest the <hi>Gaules</hi>
were most tormented. Most part of their carriage Horses falling into
the Mire, dyed, seruing the tyred Souldiers, to rest themselues vpon
and the baggage, lying downe vpon them in the Water, so as they
tooke their necessary rest some part of the night. Many Horses also
lost their hoofes, by their continuall going in the mire. <hi>Hannibal</hi> could
hardly escape the moares, but that he was carried vpon an Elephant
which was onely remaining:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth an Eye.</note> Who by a great paine in his eyes, which
had hapned by the bad condition of the Ayre, in the end hee lost an
eie, for that he had neither time nor place to prevent it.</p>
            <p>After that he had past the Moares contrary to the opinion of all the
World, and was aduertised by his Spies, that <hi>Flaminius</hi> was about the
Wals of <hi>Aretzo,</hi> he planted himselfe neere vnto the Marishes, partly
to refresh his army being tyred with so great toyle, and likewise to
learne the Resolution and forces of the Enemy, with the scituation of
the Country and Wayes. But being aduertised that among the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Italy,</hi> that was very fertile, and that the Champaigne betwixt
<hi>Aretzo</hi> and <hi>Fesula</hi> was very rich in Corne, and all other things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary;
and that moreouer the Consull was a proud man, affecting the
applause of the people, but without experience of Warre, and rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much vpon Fortune, he thought it fit, that in leauing the enemy on
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:16537:83"/>
the left hand, he should drawe towards <hi>Fesula,</hi> to spoyle the Country
of <hi>Tuscany:</hi> being conceited that the Consull, for the naturall desire
he had to purchase the fauor the people, would neuer suffer the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to bee spoi'd: Nor attend his Companion, as desiring him not in
things well done: But contrariwise would follow him wheresoeuer he
went without feare, hauing a desire to fight. By this meanes he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sawe
good opportunities to giue Battaile, making therin a wise and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique
discourse of future things. Beleeue mee he is deceiued, that
thinkes any duty greater in a Captaine,<note place="margin">The duty of a good Captain.</note> then to discouer the opinion
and Nature of the enemy. For as you must obserue in a Combate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
man and man the place where you meane to strike, and consider
diligently where he lies open and discouered: So in a great War<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

must seeke the Enemy, not so much to vnderstand where the the parts

            <p>There are many which not onely forget the publicke Affaires by a
dulnesse and negligence, but also many times those which concerne
their priuate Liues. Others subiect to Wine, cannot rest vntill they be
drunke, and some giuen too much to women, not only ruine Townes
and Common-weales, but also their Liues with infamy. Moreouer,
Cowardize and feare in priuate men is full of Reproach and disgrace,
but in a Commaunder, it is sometimes the cause of great losse. Ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening
rashnesse, Choller, and vaine bragging is preiudiciall, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to the Enemy. Beleeue me, such kind of men, doe easily fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Snares and Ambushes of their Enemies. And therefore if any
one hauing discouered the Vices of the Enemy, findes some occasion
whereby he may circumvent the Generall, he may easily preuaile ouer
the rest: For as an Enemy doth easily boord a Shippe when it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Gouernour: So if any one during the Warre, defeates a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunder
by his Iudgement and good aduice, hee will soone be master
of the rest of the Army.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Hannibal</hi> had made this Discourse of the <hi>Roman</hi> Consull, so he
was not deceiued in his opinion;<note place="margin">The Country Spoil'd by <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
               </note> for parting with all speede thorough
the <hi>Fesulans</hi> Countrey, leauing the Enemy behind, he began to put
all <hi>Tuscany</hi> to fire and Sword. The Consull inflamed herewith, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Enemy made no account of him, holding it a great disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to suffer the Goods of their Allies to bee thus spoil'd a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d carried
away before his face, could not take any rest. And therefore although
that many aduised him not to pursue <hi>Hannibal.</hi> nor to fight with him,
but to keepe his Horse and foote entire, vntill the comming of his
Companion, to the end that both Armies being ioyned, they might
mannage the Warre by a common Councell, hee would not doe any
thing, giuing them no other answere, but that they should consider
what the people of <hi>Rome</hi> would say, seeing the Enemy Camp'd in the
middest of <hi>Italy,</hi> and march directly to <hi>Rome</hi> without resistance, they
sleeping in <hi>Tuscany</hi> at his backe. Hauing vsed this Speech, he began to
pursue the Enemy, after that he had suddainly drawne his Troupes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
without consideration either of time or places, desiring onely
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:16537:83"/>
to fight, as if the Victory had beene certaine. He had put his whole
Army in hope of winning the Battaile, so as there were more which
charged themselues with chaines and fetters, and such like things, then
with armes to fight.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> marching directly to <hi>Rome,</hi> spoil'd all the Champaigne
Country, which lies betwixt the Towne of <hi>Cortone,</hi> and the Lake of
<hi>Perouze,</hi> vsing all manner of cruelty to draw the enemy to fight. But
when he had newes of <hi>Flaminius</hi> pursuite with his Army, seeing the
place conuenient to lay his Ambushes, hee began to prepare himselfe
for a battaile. There was a large plaine enuironed round about with high
Mountaines ioyned together: hauing within it a lesser Hill, which was
painfull and difficult, and behind lies the Lake of <hi>Perouze,</hi> betwixt the
which and the Mountaines, there is a narrow passage, whereby they
enter into the plaine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> gaines these first Hils, planting his Campe there, and lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Affricans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">An Ambush layd by <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal.</hi>
               </note> laying behind the Mountaines,
the Souldiers of Maiorque and Minorque, with others that were light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
armed. He doth also place in the streight, the Horse-men with the
<hi>Gaules,</hi> to the end that as soone as the <hi>Romans</hi> should be entred, they
should be wholy inuironed by the Lake and Mountaines, opposing the
Horse-men in Front. And hauing thus disposed of his men in the night,
he went to take his rest. <hi>Flaminius</hi> pursuing his enemy with great
heate, came vnto the Lake before the Sun setting, and the next day
early began to lead his Army through the streight. The day was
thicke and misty, by reason of a Fogge which came from the Lake,
and the Neighbour mountaines. When as <hi>Hannibal</hi> saw the greatest
part of the Army entred into the Plaine,<note place="margin">The <hi>Romans</hi> Surprized and Defeated.</note> and that the fore-most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
neere vnto him, hee then gaue his men a signe of battaile.
Which done, they fall vpon them that were neerest. The <hi>Romans</hi>
were amazed at this suddaine surprize,<note place="margin">The Battaile of <hi>Perouze.</hi>
               </note> for that the mist hindred their
sight, and with all the Enemies charg'd them on all sides at one instant,
so as they could not put themselues into battaile, nor make vse of their
Armes, nor scarce know what had beene done, being assailed by some
in front, by others in the Reare, and likewise vpon the Flankes. So
as many holding on their way, they were slaine like sheepe, for that
they could not succour one another, and they were sooner defeated,
then they could consider what they had to doe. <hi>Flaminius</hi> himselfe,
when there was no more hope,<note place="margin">

<hi>Gaules.</hi> There were slaine in this battaile fifteene thousand men, who
for the most part stood firme vnto the end, after the manner of the
<hi>Romans,</hi> neuer abandoning their rankes: The others inclosed betwixt
the Mountaines and the Lakes by reason of the narrow passages, and
out of hope, were slaine basely or rather miserably: For being forced
in the Lake, some were drowned striuing to swimme in their Armes:
Others going into the Water as farre as they could possibly, continued
for a time in that estate. Finally, when the enemies horse were entred,
they were slaine without pitty: Although that lifting vp their hands,
they humbly begged to haue their Liues saued, or taking Courage
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:16537:84"/>
kild one another. There were about sixe thousand of the fore-ward,
which forcing through the enemies, escaped this passage: Although
it were in their power to inclose them, and to succour their friends, yet
not knowing what was done behind them, they marcht on still, doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to make some encounter, before they had gotten the top of the
Mountaines. And hauing made a stand vpon a little Hill, and seeing
(the Mist being past) the great slaughter of their Souldiers, they hastily
got vnto a neere Burrough, like men which had no more hope of safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
for that they saw the enemy to hold the whole Countrey. The
battaile being won,<note place="margin">Sixe thousand <hi>Romans</hi> taken in a Burrough by composition</note>

besieged the Burrough. The <hi>Romans</hi> being brought to extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in the end left their Armes; and after they had concluded to haue
their Liues saued, they yeilded to this <hi>Affrican.</hi> Behold how that
famous battaile past, which was giuen betwixt the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi>

            </p>
            <p>After this <hi>Hannibal</hi> cals for those which <hi>Maherbal</hi> had taken, and
for all the rest being aboue fifteene thousand, telling them at the first
that <hi>Maherbal</hi> had no power to contract with them for their liues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his consent: And after he had vsed proud speeches vnto the <hi>Romans,</hi>
he distributed them among the Souldiers to be carefully kept in chaines,
sending away the Allies without Ransome: Telling them that hee was
not come into <hi>Gaule</hi> to make Warre against the <hi>Latin</hi> Nation, but
with the <hi>Romans</hi> for their Liberty. Afterwards he sent them home to
their Lodgings, and Commaunds to bury the bodies of those which
were of most note, being about thirty: For hee lost of all his Army
onely fifteene hundred men, whereof the greatest part were <hi>Gaules.</hi>
Hee then held a Councell with his Brother and other friends concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their affaires, who were growne so glorious for this Victory, as
they held nothing impossible.</p>
            <p>The Newes of this great Defeate was now come to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the
Senators could not long conceale it from the Common people,<note place="margin">The great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement which was at <hi>Rome</hi> for the battaile lost.</note> nor
dissemble the greatnesse thereof: So as assembling the Court, they
were forced to relate it vnto them in particular. As soone as the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
(being set in his Chaire) began to say, we haue lost a great battaile;
the amazement and trouble grew so great, as they which were at the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile
and there present, report that the terrour was greater then in <hi>Rome,</hi>
then it had beene in the fight. And it is likely; for it is not possible that
they which for a long time had not felt any great disaster, neyther in
Word, nor Deede, should patiently indure so great a losse. Yet the
Senate made a good shewe, as it was fitting, aduising what was to be
done, and what Commaunders they should choose, and with what
Troupes they should resist the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilst these things past in <hi>Tuscany,</hi> the Consull <hi>Seruilius</hi> aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was past, hee resolued to ioyne with his companions
Army. But for that it was a difficult thing, to passe so great a number
of men together, he sent <hi>Caius Centronius Propraetor</hi> before with foure
thousand Horse, to the end that if any occasion were offered, they
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:16537:84"/>
should doe that which his Companion should commaund him. <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
hauing gotten this Victory, and aduertised by his Spies of the
comming of the Enemy, hee sends <hi>Maherbal</hi> to meete them, with
the best of his Foote,<note place="margin">A defeate of the <hi>Roman</hi> Horse-men by <hi>Maherbal.</hi>
               </note> and part of his Horse-men, who being met,
they defeated the greatest part at the first charge: the rest retiring to
the first Hill, within three daies after they were taken aliue. When
as the newes of this defeate came to <hi>Rome,</hi> three daies after the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
wherewith their hearts were much aflicted, then not onely
the people, but also the Senators were in so great distresse and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as all the Citty was in teares. Wherefore leauing the Annall
Magistrates,<note place="margin">A Dictator created.</note> they had recourse to the election of a Dictator; for that
the condition of the time, and the affaires then required a Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which should haue soueraigne power. And although that <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
were very glorious for the good successe and fortune of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
yet hee did not hold it fit to goe vnto <hi>Rome.</hi> Wherefore
putting the Prouince to fire and sword,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> runs along the Coast of the <hi>Adriatique</hi> Sea.</note> and passing by the Dutchy
of <hi>Spolett<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and the Marquisat of <hi>Ancona,</hi> hee came within ten
dayes to the Region which is neare vnto <hi>Adriatique</hi> Sea, so rich
and abundant in all wealth, as the Army was not able to carry
it away.</p>
            <p>Finally, hee made a great slaughter of men in his iourney: for he
caused a Proclamation to bee made in his Campe, that they should
kill all those that they found carrying Armes,<note place="margin">The cruelty of <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
               </note> as they had common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done in Townes that were taken by assault. Hee carried so great
a hatred to the <hi>Romans,</hi> as there was no cruelty that hee omitted.
And after they had found a fit and conuenient place along the Coast
of the <hi>Adriatique</hi> Sea, abounding with all sorts of commodities,
hee laboured by all meanes to refresh his men and horses: for both
the one and the other were fallen into diseases and the Scuruy, which
they had gotten as well by the extreame cold in the Winter which
they had endured in <hi>Gaule,</hi> being alwaies in field, as by the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
toile which they had lately suffred in passing the Marishes, and the
continuall sweat and filth, by reason of their harnesse.</p>
            <p>In the meane time hee inures the <hi>Affricans</hi> to carry Armes after
the manner of the <hi>Romans,</hi> whereof hee had gotten abundance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the great spoiles of the Enemies. Moreouer, hee sent newes
to <hi>Carthage</hi> of his Victories by Sea. This was the first time that hee
approach't neare the Sea, since his first comming into <hi>Italy.</hi> The
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> being ioyfull at this newes, were wholly attentiue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the affaires of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spaine.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> made choice of <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus

that for his prowesse hee purchased and obtained the name
of <hi>Maximus,</hi> the which his family retaines vnto this day. The
Dictator differs from the Consull in this,<note place="margin">The difference betwixt a Dictator and a C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>sull must referre many things to the aduice of the
Senate: but this other hath a soueraigne and free power, vnder
whom all other Magistrates cease, except the Tribunes. But this
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:16537:85"/>
shall be for a larger discourse. Moreouer, they gaue vnto the Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<hi>Marcus Minucius</hi> for a Constable, or master of the Horse, which
is a Magistrate subiect to the Dictator,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Marcus Minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> Constable.</note> and supplies his place, when as
the necessity of affaires forceth him to be absent.</p>
            <p>In the meane time <hi>Hannibal</hi> marching along the Coast of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driatique</hi>
Sea by small iournies, fed his Army in a rich and fertile
Prouince, causing the Horse-feet to be washt with old Wine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
there was great abundance, the better to cure them of their Scabs.
Hee also caused the Souldiers which had beene wounded, to bee
carefully looked vnto, and fortified the rest for future affaires. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
past the Countries of <hi>Pretutian</hi> and <hi>Adrian,</hi> hee ruined the
Countrey of the <hi>Marrucins</hi> and <hi>Franqueuille:</hi> Moreouer, he bent
his course towards <hi>Iapygia,</hi> diuided into three, whereof some are
called <hi>Dauniens,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries ruined by <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
               </note> and the others <hi>Messapiens.</hi> Hee first ouer-runnes
<hi>Daunia</hi> beginning by <hi>Lucerna,</hi> a Collony of the <hi>Romans,</hi> thundring
ouer all the Countrey. Then setling his Campe at <hi>Ibonium,</hi> he falls
vpon the <hi>Artins,</hi> and vtterly ruines all <hi>Daunia</hi> without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.</p>
            <p>At the same time <hi>Quintus Fabius</hi> hauing taken his charge of Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and performed the accustomed Sacrifices, parts from <hi>Rome</hi>
with the Master of the Horse, and foure Legions leuied in haste: And
within few daies came to <hi>Appulia,</hi> whereas receiuing the Army
from the Consull <hi>Cneus Seruilius,</hi> being come from <hi>Rimeni,</hi> he sent
him to <hi>Rome</hi> with some troups, giuing him charge to raise an Army
at Sea at <hi>Hostia,</hi> and to defend the Coasts of <hi>Italy,</hi> if the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
should attempt any thing by Sea. Finally, he marches with all
his troups, and plants himselfe in front of the Enemy, neare vnto
<hi>Aigues,</hi> and within sixe miles of them. <hi>Hanniball</hi> aduertised of the
comming of <hi>Fabius,</hi> and meaning to amaze them suddainly, drawes
his Army to Field,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents Battaile to <hi>Fabius.</hi>
               </note> and presents it in the Battaile before the <hi>Romans</hi>
Fort: But when he had stayed some time, hee retired to his Campe,
seeing that no man came forth to fight. You must vnderstand that
<hi>Fabius</hi> had resolued from the beginning not to hazard any thing, nor
to fight, thinking it would bee very beneficiall to the <hi>Romans,</hi> if
he might defend their Townes from the Enemy. Hee was constant
in his opinion,<note place="margin">The constancy of <hi>Fabius.</hi>
               </note> so as at the end hee purchased the reputation of a
slacke man, and Coward, as if hee fled from danger onely for
feare.</p>
            <p>But soone after hee forced the World to confesse, that they could
not make choice of a Captaine that was more constant, nor wiser
to mannage the Warre, the which appeared soone after in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.
Beleeue mee, this wise Dictator vnderstood well what great
difference there was betwixt the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> Army, and that of
the <hi>Romans:</hi> Considering that the others had from their Youth fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
the Warre, hauing a Commaunder which was bred with
them in the Campe, in the raine and winde, and who from his
very Cradle had learn'd the trade: hauing gotten so many famous
victories both in <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> against the <hi>Romans</hi> and all
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:16537:85"/>
their Allies: and who moreouer, distrusting in all things, put their one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hope of safety in the Victory: the which would proue contrary
to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Wherefore he was not resolued to fight, fearing the
<hi>Numidians,</hi> for that hee was too weake in Horse: so as retiring for
his aduantage with good consideration, he stayed, and led away his
Army. The aduantages which the <hi>Romans</hi> had, were abundance of
munition and victuals, and a great Army. And therefore hee ledit
alwaies by the hilly Countries, following the Enemie neare, yet
giuing him no meanes to fight, being alwaies well victualed, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
suffring the Souldiers to goe forth, but kept them alwaies close to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
By this meanes his men were alwaies in safety, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d beate
the Enemy, if at any time they went from the Army for pillage,
so as many times there were some taken, and others slaine. This he
did to the end that by little and little hee might weaken their forces,
and encourage the Souldiers by these petty Victories, being amazed
with their former losses, nor to distrust their Forces, or Fortune.
Moreouer, they could not perswade him to come to a Battaile. But
<hi>Marcus Minucius</hi> discontent with his temporizing, blamed him of
cowardise and feare. Hee was a proud and rash man, who found
nothing more tedious and troublesome then to bee absent from a
Battaile.</p>

nor wastfully. From thence they spoiled <hi>Bene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as <hi>Hannibal</hi> saw that <hi>Fabius</hi> fled from all occasions of fighting, and
yet did not abandon the field, but followed him still by the hilly
Countrey, hee resolued to goe speedily into the Countries of <hi>Capu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Falerna,</hi> thinking that of necessitie one of the two would hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen:
either that the <hi>Romans</hi> would come to a Battaile, or that the
World would soone see that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> camp't, and that the
<hi>Romans</hi> kept themselues within their Forts. By this meanes he did
hope that the Townes of the Prouince being tertified, they would
yeeld vnto the <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> For vnto that day not any one had
fallen vnto them, although the <hi>Romans</hi> had lost two great Battailes,

and in the mid'st of the Region <hi>Capua</hi> stands, the richest of them all,
whose Lands are famous amongst the fabulous Poets, which they call
<hi>Phlegrees:</hi> and it is likely that the gods haue spoken principally of
them, by reason of their wonderfull beauty and excellency. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
this scituation is strong by nature, and in a manner impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.
For on the one side they are inclosed by the Sea, and on the
other they are wholly enuironed with Mountaines. There are onely
three entries which are narrow and painefull: the one is at <hi>Samnium,</hi>
the second at <hi>Eriban,</hi> and the third among the <hi>Arpins.</hi> The <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi>
made a shew to goe into these Countries, as into a Theater,
to amaze them all: and thereby to flye from the Enemy, and then
to campe alone.</p>
            <p>Wherefore <hi>Hannibal</hi> moued with these reasons, leades his Army
by <hi>Samnium</hi> to the streights of Mount <hi>Eriban,</hi> and plants his Campe
neere vnto the Riuer of <hi>Vantour,</hi>

and the Villages put to fire and sword. And although that
these things were very troublesome to <hi>Fabius,</hi> yet he continued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
in his resolution. But <hi>Marcus Minucius,</hi> and all the Tribunes
of the Horse, were of opinion not to temporize any longer, but
to fall vpon the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> with all their strength and forces, not
suffring the spoile of so goodly a Countrey in the view of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Army. <hi>Fabius</hi> dislodging more suddainly then he had beene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed,
seemed to make haste to preserue the Countrey of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pua</hi>
from spoile: But when hee came to <hi>Falerna,</hi> hee did but
shew his Army vpon the Mountaines, lest the Allies should thinke
he held not a Campe. Yet he would neuer drawe downe into the
field, fearing to fight with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> as well for the
reasons which wee haue formerly mentioned, as for that he was the
weaker in Cauallery.</p>
            <p>When as <hi>Hannibal</hi> had often attempted in vaine, to drawe the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to fight, in the end he studied of a place to winter in, hauing
ruined all parts of the Countrey, and taken a wonderfull spoile: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
no intent to lose his Pillage, but to transport it to some place
where he might passe the Winter: to the end his Army might not
want any thing,<note place="margin">The <hi>meanes</hi> which <hi>Fabius</hi> held to stop <hi>Hannibals</hi> pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.</note> as well for the present as the future. <hi>Fabius</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well that the returne of his Enemy would be by the same streight
by the which he had entred, hee imagined that this passage would
be beneficiall to the <hi>Romans:</hi> and placeth about foure thousand
men within these streights, intreating them to carry themselues like
braue and valiant men, when occasion should require, making vse
of the aduantage of the place. For his part, hee recouered the
next Mountaine with the rest of the Army, looking earnestly
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:16537:86"/>
about him what was to be done, and from whence and by whom the
Enemy should be Charged, holding himselfe assured to defeate their
whole Army, or at the least to make them abandon the Booty which
they carried. But <hi>Hannibal</hi> saw that <hi>Fabius</hi> fought with his owne wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons:
and hauing duly considered thereon, he disappointed his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
with an excellent stratagem, causing many Faggots of dry stickes
to be drawne together, and bound to the hornes of Oxen,<note place="margin">

<hi>Asdrubal,</hi> that in setting fire to the stickes at a certaine houre he should
chase the Troupe to the next Mountaine, which was betwixt the Camp
and the streight they were to passe, and that as soone as they should see
a signe which he would giue, they should force the Oxen against the
Mountaine, vntill they had gotten the top. When as all things were
ready, he makes them to feed and to take some rest. About mid-night
hee causeth them to march which had the charge to tie the Torches to
the hornes of the Oxen. This being suddainly done by reason of the
multitude of assistants, he giues order to kindle them all, and to chase
them to the top of the Mountaine. Finally, hee giues charge to them
that were lightly Armed, to follow them to a certaine place, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them that as soone as the Troupe should begin to runne furiously
through the Mountaines, they should recouer the places of aduantage,
whereby they might succour his men in passing,<note place="margin">The course which <hi>Hanibal</hi> tooke i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> which had been appointed to guard these passages, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that <hi>Hannibal</hi> came where they saw the fire on the toppe of the
Mountaines, abandoned their places, retiring to the highest Hils.
And when at the first they encountred some of these Oxen seperated
from the rest, they made a stand, seeing their heads on a flaming fire,
wondring as at a miracle. But when the Souldiers were discouered,
they entertained one another with casting of Darts. And when in the
end the Oxen came on, they all made a stand on the top of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
expecting day with great desire to be more certainly informed
of the businesse. <hi>Fabius</hi> aduertised of this noise, conceiuing it was
some Ambush, and flying the battaile as they resolued, kept his men
within the Fort. In the meane time <hi>Hannibal</hi> (to whom matters suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
according to his desire) past his Army by the mountaine, and
carried away all his Spoiles without any obstacle. Then seeing at the
breake of day the <hi>Romans</hi> in front against his men, and to bee stronger
in number and in their kind of Armes, he sent them a band of <hi>Spaniards</hi>
to second them: Who after they had slaine about a thousand at the
first Charge, they brought their men safe backe vnto the Campe. <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
being freed by this policy from the streights of <hi>Falerna,</hi> from
thenceforth he was more carefull to choose a safe place to Campe in,
seeking where he might Winter, greatly terrifying the Townes and

During these actions, many taxed the Dictator of Cowardize, for
that he had suffered the enemy to escape so easily, being inclosed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the streights; but hee continued still constant in his opinion. Some
few daies after he was called backe to <hi>Rome</hi> for the Sacrifices, and left
the Gouernment of the Army and all other affaires to the Constable,
giuing him charge that he should not study so much to offend the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
as to defend his owne men. But <hi>Minucius</hi> (whom the Dictator
aduised in vaine) had no other care but to fight.</p>
            <p>During these actions in <hi>Italy, Asdrubal</hi> hauing repaired thirty good
ships,<note place="margin">

ten others, parts from <hi>Carthage</hi> in the beginning of Summer, and
giues the charge to <hi>Imilcon,</hi> who ran along the Coasts, and <hi>Asdrubal</hi>
led the Army by Land neere the shore, hoping to meete at one instant
at the mouth of the Riuer of <hi>Ebro,</hi> with the Army by Sea. <hi>Cneus Scipio</hi>
aduertised that <hi>Asdrubal</hi> was gone to field, hee was first of the same
opinion, but afterwards he resolued to fight rather by Sea then Land,
by reason of the bruite of their new succours, and preparation for war.
Wherefore after hee had prepared an Army at Sea of fiue and thirty
Vessels,<note place="margin">The <hi>Romans</hi> Army at Sea.</note> he made choise of the ablest men of his whole Army, and
most actiue to fight at Sea. The which being imbarqued, he set saile
to encounter the enemy: and three dayes after hee had sail'd from <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racona,</hi>
to places neere vnto <hi>Ebro,</hi> hee comes vnto a Hauen ten miles
distant from the Enemy. From thence hee sends two Vessels of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceilles</hi>
being very swift to discouer. This was a people which had a
great League with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and had held their party, during the
time of the second Punique Warre. But as soone as these Scouts had
made Relation, that the enemies Army at Sea was in the mouth of the
Riuer of <hi>Ebro,</hi> he weighes Anchor and sayles towards them, being
desirous to surprize them vnprouided.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Asdrubal</hi> had beene aduertised of the comming of the <hi>Roman</hi> army,
by a signe which was giuen him from a Beacon or watch-Tower; and
therefore after he had ordred his Army by Land along the shore, and
and caused his Rowers to imbarque, hee puts all into armes. When
the <hi>Romans</hi> not onely approacht, but also put their shippes in battaile,
they gaue warning to fight. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> assayling them resolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
had for a time some shew of Victory. But afterwards Fortune be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to turne, for they which were vpon the shore, gaue not so much
courage to their men to fight, as hope of safety for those that would
flye. And therefore the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> got to Land, after that two of
their ships had bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> fled to shore, abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

Finally hauing followed them with great speede, they towed away
with Ropes all the Vessels which floated: And after they had vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
their Enemies they parted ioyfully as being masters of the Sea:
and of the forty shippes they tooke fiue and twenty. Being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
proud of this Victory, they were afterwards more carefull of the

the <hi>Romans</hi> feared most, was, that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> preuailing in
<hi>Spaine,</hi> would be masters of the Sea: So as afterwards they might
Saile into <hi>Italy,</hi> and furnish and supply <hi>Hannibal</hi> easily with men and
Treasure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Publius Scipio</hi> going into <hi>Spaine,</hi> ioyned with his brother; after which
the War was gouerned by their common Councell. Wherfore present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they past the Riuer of <hi>Ebro,</hi> the which before they neuer durst at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
Then Fortune began to smile on the <hi>Romans.</hi> And after they
had made subiect those which dwelt in the passage of <hi>Ebro,</hi> finding no
resistance, they came to <hi>Sagont:</hi> Where being within fiue miles of
Cape <hi>Decrux,</hi> they camped in a place safe from the Enemy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
to draw Victuals from the Sea. Soone after that their Army
at Sea arriued; whereas this accident hapned. You must vnderstand
that <hi>Hannibal</hi> at his going into <hi>Italy,</hi> had taken the Children of the
noblest Families in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and had left them in guard at <hi>Sagont:</hi> For
that the place was strong, and they which kept it, confident to the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians.</hi>
There was at time within the Towne a certaine <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
whom they called <hi>Acedux</hi> of a noble house, and as honest a man as any
other <hi>Spaniard;</hi> and among the rest very loyall to the <hi>Carthaginians:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Abilux.</note>
But at that time after the manner of most of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> hee chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
his faith together with his Fortune. This <hi>Spaniard</hi> seeing the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
to prosper in <hi>Spaine,</hi> had a desire to deliuer the Hostages; hauing
a conceite that it would be a great meanes to purchase their fauour.
When he had well considered of all the meanes to bring his enterprize
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:16537:88"/>
to an end, he goes to <hi>Bostar</hi> Chiefe of the <hi>Carthaginians. Asdrubal</hi>
had sent him into <hi>Spaine,</hi>

                  </hi> Chiefe of the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians.</hi>
               </note> to keepe the <hi>Romans</hi> from passing the Riuer.
The which not daring to attempt, he seated his Campe beyond <hi>Sagont</hi>
vpon the Bankes of the Riuer. He was a mild man, and (contrary to
the nature of the <hi>Affricans</hi>) not very politicke: He drawes him a part,
as a man which held his faith assured to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and lets him
vnderstand the estate of the affaires. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> sayd he, haue
held vnder their obedience vnto this day, the people of <hi>Spaine</hi> by cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
for that the <hi>Romans</hi> were a far off: But now the Enemies Campe
hath passed <hi>Ebro,</hi> so as euery man hath thereby occasion of a new
enterprize. And therefore it is necessary to bind those by benefits and
fauours, whom they could not retaine by feare: Moreouer, that the
<hi>Romans</hi> were neere vnto <hi>Sagont</hi> in Armes, and furnished with Armies
both by Sea and Land, so as the Towne was in danger: For this
cause he was of opinion that hee should send backe all the Hostages to
their Townes: The which if hee did, hee should first of all frustrate
the <hi>Romans</hi> of their hope, for that they did chiefly besiedge <hi>Sagont</hi> to
haue them: And that moreouer, he should purchase the loue and fauour
of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He likewise thought that it would be for the safety of the Hostages,
and that if hee would giue him the charge to carry them backe, hee
would do him no small seruice to winne their loues, and that he should
not only bind their hearts by the sending backe of the Children vnto
their Parents, but he should set before their eies, how much the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and Clemency of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> was to be esteemed. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
he propounded vnto him the expectance hee should haue of their
gifts and presents, to whom he had sent the Children, and that there
was not any man would forget so great a benefit.</p>
            <p>After he had held this kind of Speech and others to the same end, he
returned to <hi>Sagont,</hi> as soone as he had perswaded <hi>Bostar</hi> to that which
he desired, appointing a day when hee should ioyne with those which
should carry backe the Hostages. The night following he goes to the
Enemies watch, and hauing spoken to some <hi>Spanish</hi> Souldiers of the
Allies, they lead him vnto the Captaines: Where hauing vsed much
speech, what profit it would be for the affaires of <hi>Spaine,</hi> if the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stages
fell into their hands, in the end hee promiseth to deliuer them.
The <hi>Romans</hi> giuing a willing eare vnto him, weighing the greatnes of
the action, take his faith, &amp; promise him theirs with great rewards. And
after they had aduised of the place and day, when they should attend
to receiue the Hostages, he returnes. Afterwards he takes with him
such as seemed fit for this businesse, and goes to <hi>Bostar:</hi> Where recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the Hostages, he goes out of <hi>Sagont</hi> as it were to flie the enemies
Watch: But hauing past their Campe a little, hee leads them all into
an Ambush which they had prepared, as not knowing any thing. The
<hi>Romans</hi> gaue great rewards to <hi>Acedux,</hi> and made vse of him to carry
backe the Hostages to their Townes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acedux</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spires with the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </note> as he had resolued with <hi>Bostar,</hi>
sending men with him to make them fauourable. <hi>Acedux</hi> went with
them, and by this perswasions caused many to enter into League with
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:16537:88"/>
the <hi>Romans,</hi> by the meanes of these hostages: laying before their
eyes their mildnesse and great courage, and detesting the iealousies
and cruelty of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> propounding himselfe for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
<hi>Bostar</hi> after the losse of the hostages by the aduice of a Childe
repented too late. And then the season of the yeare forced both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

was a very good place, hee resolued to winter his Army
there. And passing the Mountaine of <hi>Lyburna,</hi> hee drawes to those
places. Being come to <hi>Geryona,</hi> fiue and twenty miles from <hi>Lucerna,</hi>
hee began first to summon the Inhabitants to yeeld,<note place="margin">

and assuring them of his faith. But losing his time hee besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Towne, the which hee tooke presently, and slew all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
preseruing the greatest part of the houses to serue him
for Garners: then hee planted his Campe close vnto the Towne,
being well ditched and pallisadoed. This done, hee sends two parts
of his Army to gather in the Corne, and continued in battaile with
the third part, as well to guard the Campe, as to preuent all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of those which gathered in the Corne. They brought in
dayly a wonderfull quantity, for that the Region was very large,
and the number of the people in a manner infinite,<note place="margin">Marcus Minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius.</note> and haruest was

hee should sometimes encounter the Enemy in some bad

            <p>But being aduertised that they gathered in the Corne, after the
taking of <hi>Geryona,</hi> and had seated their Campe neare vnto it, hee
goes into the plaine and recouers a high Hill vpon the way, where
hee planted his Campe: and there hee studied by what policy hee
might fall vpon those which were in battaile. But when as <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
found the <hi>Romans</hi> to bee so neare, hee sent onely the third
part of his Army for Corne, and kept the two other parts in the Campe.</p>
            <p>After which hee plants himselfe nearer vnto the Enemy, about
two miles from <hi>Geryona,</hi> to the end hee might seeme to bee care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to defend those which gathered the Corne, if they made any
attempt against them. In the meane time there was a little Hill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the two Campes, which was very fit and conuenient for the
<hi>Carthaginians,</hi> if they could take it, and dangerous for the <hi>Romans.
Hannibal</hi> sent <hi>Numidians</hi> thither in the Night, who tooke it. But
when as <hi>Minucins</hi> at the breake of day, saw that they held it, hee
puts forth those that were lightly armed, and giues an assault vnto
the Hill.</p>
            <p>The Combate for a time was very fierce and cruell: but in
the end the <hi>Romans</hi> had the best successe,<note place="margin">The <hi>Cart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by force: whither presently the whole Army retired. <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:16537:89"/>
continued for some dayes within his Campe, for that the
<hi>Romans</hi> were still in front. But soone after necessity forced him to
send some to feed the Horses for the Baggage, and others to the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest:
to the end that as hee had resolued, he might not consume that
which hee had gotten, but might draw together some great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Corne to Winter, hauing alwayes a great care the Army
should not haue neede of any thing in that time, especially the
Horses and sumpters, for that all his hope and confidence was in
the Cauallery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Minucius</hi> seeing the Enemies dispersed, and wandring vp and
downe, hee drawes his men to field, and marching directly against
their Campe, puts them in battaile, and sends the Horse-men with
the best Foote-men against the Forragers,<note place="margin">The <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
               </note> giuing them charge to
kill all, and not to receiue any to mercy. <hi>Hannibal</hi> surprized with
this suddaine accident, durst not put his men in battaile, neither could
hee succour those that were disperced. The <hi>Roman</hi> Horse-men with
those that were lightly armed, made a great slaughter of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
thus scattred. They likewise which were with <hi>Minucius,</hi> grew
so resolute and couragious, as they durst in a manner force the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Fort, and besiege them. <hi>Hannibal</hi> finding himselfe destitute of
counsell and helpe, kept himselfe within his Fort, which hee guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with great difficulty, when as <hi>Asdrubal</hi> gathering the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
together which fled to the place where their Campe had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beene, neere vnto the Walles of <hi>Geryona,</hi> came to succour him
with about foure thousand men. Then resuming a little courage, he
comes out of his Fort, sauing his Army from that present danger with
great difficulty. <hi>Minucius</hi> hauing made a great slaughter before the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Fort, and not much lesse in the field, he retired with a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
hope for the future. And three dayes after hee lodged in the Campe
abandoned by the Enemies. For <hi>Hannibal</hi> fearing left the <hi>Romans</hi> by
night should lodge in the Campe which he had left neere vnto <hi>Geryona,</hi>
and so get all the spoiles, he returned thither with speed with his whole
Army.</p>
            <p>After this defeate, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were more wary how to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and goe for Corne, and contrariwise the <hi>Romans</hi> more hardy to
vndergoe dangers. In the meane time the newes of the victory was (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the vsuall manner) made farre greater then it had beene: so
as all the World reioyced. First for that they imagined that after so
many losses, this was the beginning of a better fortune: and iudge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
that the slacknesse and cowardize which had seemed to bee in
their Army, was not the fault of the Souldiers, but of the Dictator.
And therefore all the World contemned <hi>Fabius,</hi> and held him to
bee dull and a Coward. Contrariwise they did so highly extoll and
praise <hi>Minucius,</hi> as they gaue him equall power with the Dictator,
the which had not beene formerly seene, hoping that hee would
soone make an end of the Warres of <hi>Italy.</hi> Thus there were two
Dictators at one time, and in one Army:<note place="margin">Two Dictators at <hi>Rome</hi> at one instant.</note> which was a new
thing.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:16537:89"/>
               <hi>Minucius</hi> much more proud then it is credible, as well for his good
fortune as the peoples fauour, grew so glorious as if the Enemies were
already defeated and vanquished. <hi>Fabius</hi> fainted not, nor lost his
courage, for the iniury they had done vnto him,<note place="margin">Fabius retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the Campe.</note> but returned to the
Campe alwaies constant in his opinion. But when hee saw that his
Companion was much troubled to finde an occasion of fighting, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
lest hee should commit some folly, he gaue him the choice, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that one of them should for a certaine time, or euery other day,
or for a longer space, haue the Gouernment of the Campe,<note place="margin">The diuision of the <hi>Roman</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my betwixt the two Dictators.</note> or else
they should diuide the Legions betwixt them after the manner of the
Consuls, and that either of them should doe with his Army what
hee pleased. Wherefore they parted their Troupes, and had their
Campes separated about a Mile and an halfe distant one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
            <p>When as <hi>Hannibal</hi> was aduertised not onely by the Fugitiues, but
also of their actions, of the hatred betwixt the Commaunders, and
of the ouerweening of <hi>Minucius,</hi> thinking that this would further
his intention, he sought occasion to fight with him: hoping hee
should easily abate his fury and presumption. There was a little Hill
betwixt <hi>Minucius</hi> Campe, and that of the <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> whereon
whosoeuer seazed, it would proue very preiudiciall to the other,
And when as <hi>Hannibal</hi> made haste to get it, being certaine that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nucius</hi>
would come to preuent him, as hee had other times done, he
vsed this stratagem. First of all the whole Plaine betwixt them at
the first sight seemed vnfit to lay an Ambush,<note place="margin">The policy of <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
               </note> being void of woods
and bushes: Yet there were about it many turnings and hollow
Rocks, where they might easily hide Souldiers. Hee sends by
Night to these hollow places, according to the capacity which hee
knew to bee in them, two hundred, and three hundred, and fiue
hundred Horse together with fiue thousand Foote. And to the
end they should not bee discouered by the Fotragers, hee send at the
breake of day, some that were lightly armed, to take this Hill. The
which when <hi>Minucius</hi> perceiued, contemning so small a number, he
marcht with his Army to repell the Enemy from thence. First hee
sent those that were lightly armed, commaunding them to charge:
then the Horse-men. Finally, hee followes with those that were
compleatly armed, not changing the order which hee had held in
other encounters.</p>
            <p>The summe was now risen, and all the World looked vpon this Hil.
The Ambushes were couered: <hi>Hannibal</hi> sent succours continually to
his men, and afterwards followed with all his Cauallery. Finally,<note place="margin">A Combate betwixt the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>
               </note>
the two Armies fought with all their Troupes: and in the end the
<hi>Roman</hi> Foote-men that were lightly armed, were forced by the
Horse-men to retire to their Companions that were better armed.
Then the Ambush brake forth, and charged on all sides with great
cries, so as they not onely distressed and aflicted those that were
lightly armed, but likewise the whole Army. The which <hi>Fabius</hi>
perceiuing, and fearing that the <hi>Roman</hi> Army might be wholy defeated,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:16537:90"/>
parts from his Campe and succours his Companion: At whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the <hi>Romans</hi> reioyced,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fabius</hi> succours <hi>Minucius.</hi>
               </note> and retired presently to their Ensignes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they were broken and scattered here and there, with the losse
of many Souldiers that were lightly Armed, and diuers others of the
Legions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> seeing the Enemies re-inforced with Succours, and that
they marcht directly towards him, he caused a Retreat to be sounded.
Then all the <hi>Romans</hi> which were in the fight confessed publickly that
the Vertue and Wisedome of <hi>Fabius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius.</hi>
               </note> had saued the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire,
which the ouer-weening of <hi>Minucius</hi> had lost and ruined. When as
the newes came to <hi>Rome,</hi> all the World knew plainly, what difference
there is betwixt the ouer-weening and ignorance of Souldiers, and the
iudgement and aduice of a wise Captaine. From that time the <hi>Romans</hi>
contented themselues with one Campe, and all obeyed <hi>Fabius.</hi> The
which I find related after this manner by another Author.</p>
            <p>VVHen the two Armies were returned to their owne Campes, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nucius</hi>
hauing his Souldiers about him speake vnto them in this
manner.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Minucius</hi> his Speech.</note> I haue often heard say, louing Souldiers, that hee is
most Wise that can giue good Councell, and tell what is to be done in his
difficult Affaires: And hee is next Wise that can obey him that giueth good
councell; but hee that can neyther giue good councell himselfe, nor obey
other mens councell, is of all others most ignorant and foolish. Seeing that
Fortune hath denied <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s the first of these Gifts, let vs keepe the second, and
whilst we learne to Rule, let vs propound vnto our selues to obey them that

               </gap>e me salute him as my Protector and Father, you likewise shall
salute his Souldiers as your noble Patrons, by whose strength and resolution
you are preserued this day. Whereupon they presently remoued their Tents,
and went to <hi>Fabius</hi> Campe, whereat he maruailed much. <hi>There</hi> Minucius
<hi>submitted himselfe and his men to the protection of</hi> Fabius, <hi>resigning
the authority of the Empire into his hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> thought to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modate a place to passe the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hauing inuironed it with Ditches, betwixt the Hill and their
Campe, and fortified the top of the Hill with men and Pallisadoes:
In the meane time the day of the Election of Consuls was come, where
they deposed the Dictators, and made choise for Consuls of <hi>Lucius
Emilius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lucius Emilius</hi> and <hi>Caius Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencius</hi> chosen Consuls.</note> and <hi>Caius Tarrentius Varro.</hi> And when as <hi>Emilius</hi> had crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for Pro-Consuls, the Consuls of the precedent Army, <hi>Cneus Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilius</hi>
and <hi>Marcus Attileus Regulus,</hi> who had beene subbrogated in the
place of <hi>Flaminius,</hi> they tooke the charge of all the Troupes that
were in the Campe, mannaging all the Affaires of Warre. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls
make a new Leuy of men to furnish their Army: and giue charge
vnto the Pro-Consuls, that they should not dare to fight a Battaile with
the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> but entertaine their Souldiers with light skirmishes,
and invre the Youth to hardnesse and labour for the time to come: for
that they imputed the defeats past vnto the ignorance and slacknesse of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:16537:90"/>
the Souldiers. <hi>Lucius Postumus</hi> was created Praetor, and sent into
<hi>Gaule</hi> with an Army,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lucius Postu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> Praetor.</note> to do the like vnto those <hi>Gaules</hi> which were in
<hi>Hannibals</hi> seruice. They also prouided Rowers for the Vessels which
were at <hi>Lylibeum:</hi> And they sent whatsoeuer was necessary to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
that were in <hi>Spaine.</hi> During these actions at <hi>Rome, Cneus Serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
and his Companion <hi>Attilius,</hi> following the Commaundment of
the Consuls, did not any thing worthy of memory, but make light
skirmishes, both by reason they were forbidden by the Consuls, and
for the roughnesse of the Weather: Finally, they mannaged the affaires
wisely and with great policy. By this meanes the two Armies wintred
in view one of another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> dislodged in the beginning of the Spring, and leauing <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryona,</hi>
(for that he had resolued so to presse the <hi>Romans,</hi> as they should
be forced to come to a battaile,) he takes the Fort of <hi>Naples,</hi> well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with Corne and all other munition:<note place="margin">The Fort of <hi>Naples</hi> taken by <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
               </note> For the <hi>Romans</hi> had drawne
thither a great quantity of Corne from <hi>Canusium,</hi> and other neighbour
Countries, wherewith the Campe was vsually Victualed. This done
they were in great perplexity, not so much for the losse of the muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as for that the whole Country was left in prey to the enemy. They
send men to <hi>Rome,</hi> to acquaint the Senate therewith, and that they
might aduise what was to be done: For that they had resolued to giue
battaile if the Enemy approached: Seeing there was no meanes of
flight, and that the whole Prouince was ruined, and their Allies wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.
The Senate sent them word that they should not attempt any
thing, but expect the comming of the Consuls, whom they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
commaunded to depart. All the World had their eyes fixed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Paulus Emilius:</hi> They had their hope in him, aswell for his Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
as for that he had in former times done great exploits against the
<hi>Sclauonians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>BEing ready to depart, I finde it Written that</hi> Fabius <hi>stayed him for
a time, speaking thus vnto him.</hi> If thou good <hi>Lucius Emilius</hi> wert
matcht with a Companion like vnto thy Selfe,<note place="margin">Fabius <hi>Speech to</hi> Lucius Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius.</note> or if thou wert like vnto
thy Fellow, then were my Speech in vaine, which I will now make for you
both, for being good Consuls you would worke effectually for the common
wealth, although I should be silent. But if you were both bad, then would
you neither heare my words, nor admit of my Councell. But knowing thy
integrity, and the conditions of thy Companion, I fore-see that thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
shall little auaile the Common-wealth, through the folly of thy Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
So as the Common-wealth doth halt, and is halfe same; whereby euill
Councell shall preuaile aswell as good. Wherefore to Thee onely my Speech
tends, fore-telling Thee that Thou shalt haue as much Warre with thy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<hi>Tarentius,</hi> as with <hi>Hannibal:</hi> Neither doe I know which of them will
be a more deadly enemy vnto thee. For thou shalt not onely fight with <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
in the field, but with thy fellow thou shalt haue continuall Warre in
all places, and at all times. With <hi>Hannibal</hi> thou shalt fight with thy Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and foote-men, but <hi>Varro</hi> will assatle thee with thine owne men. I pray
thee remember <hi>Caius Flaminius,</hi> who being Consull and hauing his men
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:16537:91"/>
about him in his Campe, beganne to grow mad. This man (before hee was
made Consull, and now being Consull, euen in the Senate-house, before hee
sees his field or his enemy,) is already mad. And hee that thus talketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Senators, what thinke you will he doe when hee shalbe in the field
among a number of fresh young Souldiers, where as one word speaking, all
the matter shalbe decided. But in case he make haste to fight, as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith he
will, either I know not what belongeth to the Warre, or else we are like to
suffer greater losses, then we did at <hi>Trasimenum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is but one way to maintaine warre against <hi>Hannibal,</hi> the which I
haue fore-seene, and none will be found so good to make him weary of <hi>Italy.</hi>
We are in our owne Country, hauing Citties and faithfull Allies ready to
assist vs at all times with Horse, Harnesse, Victualls, and all other necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
<hi>Hannibal</hi> is in a strange Country among his enemies, farre from
home, he looketh for no peace both by Sea or Land: Hee hath no Citties to
receiue him; he hath nothing but what he stealeth, and taketh by rapine:
he hath scarcely the third part of his Army left, which hee brought ouer
<hi>Iberus:</hi> more are dead by famine then with the Sword; and heere hee can
hardly feede those that are liuing. Wherefore doubt not but in sitting still,
you shall vanquish such an Army, which decreaseth daily in strength, and
cannot haue their wants supplied. This is the onely meanes to dally and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
your enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Varro</hi> desireth battaile, and <hi>Hannibal</hi> hath the like desire. Wherefore
thou alone must wisely oppose thy selfe against them both, and regard not
what they speake of thee, let not the vaine glory of thy Fellow, nor the
false aspertions which shalbe cast vpon thee, mooue thee to the contrary. Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
thy Selfe to be called fearefull, slow, and vnskilfull in the Warre. It is
better to be feared of thy wise enemy, then to be praised of thy foolish com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
My meaning is, not that thou shouldest do nothing, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
thou shalt attempt, do it soberly, and according to reason, not rashly,
trusting to Fortune; follow not the occasions that the enemy will giue Thee:
And be not ouer hasty; for haste is blind and worketh vnsafely.</p>
            <p>To these and his other Words the Consull answered little, saying
onely that were more true then easie to be followed: But hee would
professe one thing, that his desire should alwayes be, to haue things
succeede well: But in case it should otherwise happen, hee would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
expose himselfe, to the danger of his enemies Weapons, then to
the exclamations of his angry Citizens. With these words he parted
out of the Citty, and went to the Campe with his hasty Companion.
It was ordred that the Warres should be mannaged with eight Legions,
the which had neuer beene done, and that euery Legion should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
of fiue thousand men. The <hi>Romans</hi> as we haue sayd, make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate
Army of foure Legions,<note place="margin">A Legion of fiue thousand Men, and the manner how the <hi>Romans</hi> raise <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n Army.</note> euery Legion being foure thousand
foote, and two hundred Horse, or else of fiue thousand foote, and
three hundred horse, if there be any great necessity. To the which
they adde as many foote of theis Allies, and thrice as many Horse.
All the Troupes are equally deuided betwixt the Consuls. Most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
one Consull giues battaile with two Legions, and with the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:16537:91"/>
of their Allies. They seldome fight with all their Troupes. But
the feare and amazement of the <hi>Romans,</hi> was then so great of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi>
as they thought it fit not to fight onely with foure, but
with eight Legions together. And therefore after they had giuen faire
admonitions to the Consuls, and had laied before them the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of the affaires which way soeuer Fortune should turne, they
Commaunded them to goe vnto the Campe intreating them to doe the
duties of good men, in the administration of the Warre, as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Maiesty required.</p>
            <p>After the comming of the Consuls to the Campe, they mingled the
new Bands to the old Army, and let many vnderstand the will of the
Senate, wishing the multitude to be of good Courage, considering
the season of the time: Wherewith <hi>Emilius</hi> made an Oration, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
this in a manner is the Substance.</p>
            <p>THat for losses lately made, they should not faint like men amazed:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Paulus Emilius</hi> speech vnto the Souldiers.</note>
For the losses in former Battailes had not hapned for one or two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
but for many. And if at this day they be Men of Courage and
Resolution, there was nothing could hinder, but they should obtaine a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Victory. That neuer vnto this houre, the two Consuls had fought with
all the Legions together, nor with more warlike Men, nor of greater Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
And if on the other side they haue made vse of young Men, and
little acquainted with the Art of warre, and who moreouer were so ill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised
of the Enemies enterprizes, of the scituation of places, and the
nature of the Region, so as many times they haue found themselues in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
when they had scarce seene the Enemy; which was a matter of great
consequence: For they which were defeated in <hi>Gaule,</hi> neere vnto the Riuer of
<hi>Trebia,</hi> came to fight without reason, neuer inquiring of the enemies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize,
within three daies after their arriuall from <hi>Sicily;</hi> and they
which were neere vnto the Lake of <hi>Peronza,</hi> were defeated before they
could see the enemy, by reason of a great Fogge.</p>
            <p>But now Companion, saith he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all things are for vs; for wee are two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls
vnited in one will, and the same forces, and we haue with vs those of

the order which Souldiers obserue, and the enemies Troupes: But
moreouer behold the second yeare, wherein you haue had experience of all
this, in practising your selues, and fighting continually. Wherefore see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that things are contrary to those which hapned in former Battailes, it
is not likely but the end should prooue otherwise. It is not credible, nay I
say it is impossible, seeing that in fighting with the enemy with an equall
number in so many incounters, you haue parted Victors, that now you
should be vanquished by them with all the Troupes, seeing you haue a double
Army.</p>
            <p>Seeing then Companions that you haue the Victory in your owne hands,
you haue no more neede of our Counsell and care. I might make you a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Speech, if I did hold it necessary; for this must be expected from those
which are mercenary, or being drawne from the Allies are Commaunders
of an Army, to whom nothing is more troublesome then a day of Battaile.

In regard of those which are like vnto vs, whose liues are not onely in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,

            <p>What man is he that would not eyther vanquish in fighting, or die in
the Combat, then to liue in misery, and attend so great a storme and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty?
Courage Companions, consider with your selues what a difference
there is betwixt vanquishing and to be vanquished, and what followes the
one and the other, and prepare your selues to Battaile, so as you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that it is not the <hi>Roman</hi> Army that is in danger, but the
Countrey; and moreouer the head of the World. What shall the <hi>Romans</hi>
haue remaining after your defeat? They haue put all their forces and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
into your hands, and all their hope is in you. I intreate you for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the immortall Gods, that you would not frustrate their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Yeeld the thankes which you owe vnto your Countrey, let all the world
know, that the losses formerly made, were not by the prowesse of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi>
more then by the <hi>Romans:</hi> but for that the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
were at that time new, and ignorant of the Warre.</p>
            <p>After this Speech or the like, <hi>Emilius</hi> dismist the Souldiers. Three
dayes after the Army marcht towards the Enemies Campe, and on
the third day they planted themselues neare vnto them. But <hi>Emilius</hi>
seeing that the Plaine was large, hee was not of opinion to fight with
the Enemy: for that hee was stronger in Horse-men, and that they
must draw them into some place where the Foote-men might haue
the aduantage. Contrariwise <hi>Varro</hi> being of little experience in the
Warre, was of aduice not to deferre the battaile, lest the Enemy
should escape from them. And therefore these two Consuls were in
contention and debate,<note place="margin">Discord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Consuls.</note> which is the worst thing that can happen in
a Campe.</p>
            <p>That day (for they gouerne it by dayes) <hi>Varro</hi> had the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund:
who dislodging from his Campe, made ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e to approach
neare vnto the Enemy, notwithstanding that <hi>Emilius</hi> opposed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to the contrary. <hi>Hannibal</hi> marcheth against them with his
men lightly armed, and his Horse-men, and assaults them with a
fight more likely to their fore-runners, then to a pitcht Battaile.
The <hi>Romans</hi> receiued them valiantly: Finally, the Night par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them.<note place="margin">A skirmish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </note> The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> hauing gotten little, retired to their
Campe.</p>
            <p>And when as three dayes after <hi>Lucius Emilius</hi> had resolued not to
fight, and could nor disswade the other, hee diuides the Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
three,<note place="margin">The Riuer of <hi>Fante.</hi>
               </note> and fortifies two parts on this side the Riuer of <hi>Fante,</hi> which

on this side the Riuer, about two Miles and an halfe distant
from the other two, and in a manner as much from the Enemies
Campe. When as <hi>Hannibal</hi> had found out a conuenient place
for his Horse-men to fight in, and thinking that the Consuls would
come to the Combat, hee began to put his men in Battaile: But
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:16537:92"/>
fearing that the Army was amazed, by reason of this last Fortune,
hee resolued to preach vnto them.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibals</hi> Speech vnto his Souldiers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> He drawes them together, and
commaunds them to looke vpon the Countrey which was about
him, demaunding of them what they could desire of the Gods more
beneficiall and profitable then the offer of a battaile, in those places
where they might make vse of their Horse-men which were inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible.
And when as all had confest it freely, therefore saith hee,
giue thankes first vnto the immortall Gods: for in preparing vs the
Victory, they haue brought the Enemy into this place of aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
for vs, and secondly to vs, who by our industry and labour
haue forced them to come to fight. The <hi>Romans</hi> cannot flie, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide
the Combate, and therefore the battaile and victory is in your
hands.</p>
            <p>I hold it folly now to perswade you to performe the duties of braue
men. It had beene well spoken, when you had no experience of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Forces: the which at this present time wee made knowne
vnto you by words and example. But what preaching can more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
and encourage your hearts then the workes themselues: seeing
you haue obtained the Victory in three great seuerall battailes? You
haue beene Masters of the Field in the Combats past, and haue had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of all things as wee haue promised you: So as hitherto I
haue neuer failed of my promise. But the Combate at this day is for
Townes and treasure: if you gaine this battell, you shall be Lords
of all <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, after so many labours and dangers, being deliuered by this
alone, you shall purchase the felicity of the <hi>Romans:</hi> You shall bee
the Head and Emperours of all the World. For the effecting where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
there is not any neede of words, but of effects. By the will of
the Gods before it be long, you shall all see by experience that I am a
man of my promise. After these Remonstrances, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

their resolution, he planted his Campe vpon the Riuer-side, where
the Enemies greatest forces lay. The day following hee commaunds
them to treate themselues well, and to prepare themselues to battaile
for the day following. And therefore at the third day he passed the
Riuer at the Sunne-rising,<note place="margin">

(seeing that his Forces were not equall in that place, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>Hannibal</hi> would dislodge for want of victuals) came not out
of his Fort.</p>
            <p>When as <hi>Hannibal</hi> had stayed some time there, seeing that hee
had in vaine called the Enemies forth to fight, he retired the rest of
his Army to the Campe, and sent the <hi>Numidians</hi> to charge those
which came from the <hi>Romans</hi> lesser Campe to water: which they
kept and detained from them, pursuing them with great cries vnto
the Fort. Whereat <hi>Varro</hi> disdaining much, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Campe
should bee annoyed by these men, was the more inflamed and
encouraged vnto battaile. The whole multitude wished nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
nothing more, so much the expectance in all things is
tedious.</p>

And as in the meane time the newes were come to <hi>Rome,</hi> that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

they were one right against another, and that there were dayly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters,

they came (after they had vanquished and ruined the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>)
to be Lords not onely of <hi>Italy,</hi> but also of the whole world. And
therefore we will conclude this booke, and likewise the actions of <hi>Spaine</hi>
and <hi>Italy,</hi> which were during the hundreth and fortieth Olimpiade. And
when we shall come to those of <hi>Greece,</hi> during the same Olimpiade, we
will speake more at large of the <hi>Roman</hi> Common-wealth: For I hold it
not onely necessary for the Reader, for the knowledge of the History,
but also profitable, to correct and gouerne a Common-wealth.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE haue in my opinion sufficiently shewed the
causes of the second punique warre in this last
Booke, and then the descent of <hi>Hannibal</hi> into
<hi>Italy:</hi> Wee haue also related many Combats
betwixt the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> vnto
the Battaile which was fought neere vnto the
Riuer of <hi>Fante,</hi> and the Towne of <hi>Cannes.</hi> Now
wee will pursue the warres of <hi>Greece</hi> of the same
time, deliuering in few words, the things men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by vs in the second Booke of the preparation of our worke, and
especially of the Common-weale of the <hi>Acheins:</hi> Considering that
their manner of gouernment tooke a great increase, as well before as in
our time.<note place="margin">Tisamenes.</note> And therefore beginning with the time of <hi>Tisamenes</hi> (one of
the sonnes of <hi>Orestes)</hi> we haue said that the <hi>Acheins</hi> liued from his time
vnto the Reigne of <hi>Gyges,</hi> vnder Kings descending from him: And that
hauing chased them away, the Citie being well aduised, gaue the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
vnto the Commons: Some few yeares after the Townes and
Burroughes began to fall into dissention, by the meanes of the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian</hi>
Princes. Yet afterwards as we haue said, the <hi>Acheins</hi> reunited
themselues, which was the first meanes that all <hi>Morea</hi> tooke the sirname
of <hi>Acheins.</hi> Wee haue moreouer deliuered their actions in perticular,
vnto the Defeate of <hi>Cleomenes</hi> King of the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cleomenes</note> And there
we haue concluded our preparation, with the death of <hi>Antigonus, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus,</hi>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:16537:95"/>

               <note place="margin">The time of the death of <hi>Antigonus, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus,</hi> and <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy.</hi>
               </note> for they all died in one Olimpiade. It rests now,
that in writing the Remainder, wee should begin there. The subiect
seemes good: first, for that the deedes which <hi>Arate</hi> hath written, end
at that time, to the end that to continue the Narration of the <hi>Grecians</hi>
actions, wee should prosecute (as wee haue promised) those which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low:
And for that the times are so vnited, as one part hath beene in our
age,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Polybius</hi> writes nothing but what he hath seene, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from those which had seen them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and the other in the time of our Parents. By this meanes we haue
seene part, and heard the rest from those which haue seene them. I
haue not held it fit to seeke things farre off, nor to make a relation grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from heare-say or report, for that I conceiue it would not be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
for the Reader: And therefore let vs begin with the time, when
as Fortune seemed to haue made a new world. <hi>Philip</hi> the lawfull sonne
of <hi>Demetrius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Philip.</note> being in his younger yeares, had taken possession of the
Empire of <hi>Macedon.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acheus.</note> 
               <hi>Acheus</hi> Lord of all the Prouince neere vnto <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
had not onely the Name of a King, but also the Forces.<note place="margin">Antiochus.</note> 
               <hi>Antiochus</hi>
sirnamed great, succeeded his Brother <hi>Seleucus</hi>
               <note place="margin">Seleucus.</note> lately dead, in the Realme
of <hi>Syria,</hi> although hee were but young: and <hi>Ariarates</hi> had taken the
Realme of <hi>Capadocia.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ptolomy Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pater.</note> At the same time also <hi>Ptolomy Philopater</hi> had
gotten the Empire of <hi>Egipt:</hi> and soone after <hi>Lycurgus</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lycurgus.</note> was chosen King
of the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> likewise had chosen <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
for their Generall in the Warres as we haue mentioned. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it seemes that there was an alteration, seeing that all the Potentates
were renewed, which is a naturall thing, and which happened at one
time.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians</hi> made the warre which we haue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned:
and <hi>Antiochus</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> that of <hi>Syria.</hi> In regard of the
<hi>Acheins</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The causes of the warre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheins</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> against the <hi>Etoliens</hi> and <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
               </note> they had warre against the <hi>Etoliens</hi> and <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>
Whereof see the causes. The <hi>Etoliens</hi> being long discontented
with peace, were not content to liue vpon their owne charges, as being
accustomed to liue vpon their Neighbours, for the necessity of their
great expences, by reason of their Naturall arrogancie, whereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
subiect, they lead a cruell and brutish life, obseruing no law of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
nor alliance: so as all things are of good prize vnto them. And
although that during the life of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> they did not stirre, fearing the
forces of the <hi>Lacedemonians:</hi> Yet after his death when as <hi>Philip</hi>
had succeeded him, they began (disdaining his youth) to seeke occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of warre with them of <hi>Morea:</hi> and namely, for that by an ancient
custome of iniuries, they had vsed to rob and spoile at Sea: And that
moreouer they held themselues more powerfull to make warre then the
<hi>Acheins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being in this humour, soone after they found this occasion, together
with the fauour and fortune of their enterprize. <hi>Dormiache Triconee</hi>
was sonne to <hi>Nicostrates,</hi> who violated the affaires of the <hi>Pambiotins:</hi>
who being yet young and full of arrogancie and pride, an <hi>Etolien</hi> had
beene sent by the Common-wealth to <hi>Phigalea:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The scituation of <hi>Phigalea.</hi>
               </note> It is a Towne scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
right against the <hi>Messenian</hi> Mountaines, and which by fortune was
then allied to the <hi>Etoliens.</hi> Hee let them vnderstand that hee had beene
sent thether to gouerne the Towne and the Country: Although they
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:16537:96"/>
had done it of purpose to discouer the estate of <hi>Morea.</hi> But for that in
regard of the alliance, they could not victuall the Pyrats, who wandring
there abouts, retired to him to <hi>Phigalea</hi> for their Munition, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for that the peace made with <hi>Antigonus</hi> continued still, hee aduised
them to carry away the <hi>Messeniens</hi> Cattell, who were their Friends and
Allies.<note place="margin">The <hi>Etoliens</hi> spoile the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seniens.</hi>
               </note> The which they began at the first to chase out of their limits:
and afterwards as their obstinacie increased by little and little, to ruine
the houses in the night standing scattered in the Fields, and to spoile and
ruine the whole Country. The <hi>Messeniens</hi> discontented herewith, send an
Embassie to <hi>Dorimache,</hi> to complaine of the outrages done by the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
who at the first made no account of it, doing it partly for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the Pyrates, and partly for his owne interest, hauing a share in
the Booty. But being often prest by Embassies, by reason of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of the wrongs, he told them that he would be soone at <hi>Messena</hi>
to doe them right, for the complaints they made against the <hi>Etoliens.</hi>
Being arriued, and that many presented themselues vnto him hauing bin
wronged, hee sent some away with scoffes: others with iniuries, and
some he terrified with bigge and outragious words. During these pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits
at <hi>Messena,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The</hi> Etoliens <hi>take</hi> Chiron <hi>by</hi> Scalado.</note> the Pyrates came in the night to a Burrough called <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
and tooke it by <hi>Scalado,</hi> and sacking and spoiling it, they slewe some
of those which were found in Armes, and carrie away the rest Prisoners
with the Cattell.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Messenians</hi> being more incensed herewith, considering his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
and finally thinking that they were deluded, they cause him to
come before the Magistrates. By good fortune <hi>Schiron,</hi> a man of good
esteeme, and at that time Gouernour of the <hi>Messeniens,</hi> was of opinion,
not to suffer <hi>Dorimache</hi> to part out of the Towne, before hee had resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the spoiles which the Pyrates had made, and repaired the houses in
the Country, and deliuered those which had committed the Murthers.
And when as all the assembly approued of this Councell, <hi>Dorimache</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
with choller, told them they were fooles, and if in doing that,
they thought to wrong <hi>Dorimache,</hi> and not the <hi>Etoliens:</hi> And that more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
they did him great wrong, and that within a short time reuenge
would be taken.</p>
            <p>There was at that time in <hi>Messena</hi> a man of base condition, called <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrthe,</hi>
so like in face,<note place="margin">Babyrthe.</note> body, lineaments, and voyce to <hi>Dorimache,</hi> that if
they had giuen him his Crowne and Robe, you could hardly haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
them. This <hi>Dorimache</hi> knew well. And when he vsed proud
and audatious words to the <hi>Messeniens, Schiron</hi> grew into choller, telling
him, thinkest thou that we care for thee or <hi>Babyrthe</hi> for this thy rashnes.
After which words, <hi>Dorimache</hi> thought good to strike saile, restoring to
the <hi>Messeniens</hi> all the pillage. And going then to <hi>Etolia,</hi> he tooke this
speech of <hi>Schiron</hi> so to heart, as without any other cause he made warre
against the <hi>Messeniens.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ariston.</note> At that time <hi>Ariston</hi> was chiefe of the <hi>Etoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,</hi>
who by reason of the weakenesse of his body, growne by a long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,
could not mannage this warre. Although hee were allied to
<hi>Scope</hi> and to <hi>Dorimache,</hi> yet he gaue the conduct to <hi>Dorimache.</hi> But he
durst not openly incense the <hi>Etoliens</hi> to make warre against the <hi>Messe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niens:</hi>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:16537:96"/>
for that hee could no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> propound for a sufficient cause, as grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
onely vpon choller for an iniury spoken to him. And therefore
leauing this aduice, hee adresseth himselfe to <hi>Scope</hi> in priuate, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
him to oppose himselfe against the <hi>Messeniens:</hi> being then as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> by reason of the minority of their King, for
that <hi>Philip</hi> had not seauenteene yeares compleate: and that moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> held not the party of the <hi>Messeniens,</hi> acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him with the Friendship and alliance hee had with the <hi>Grecians.</hi>
Wherefore hee found not any man that could hinder his passage to
<hi>Messena.</hi> Then hee propounded vnto him with an <hi>Etolien</hi> perswasion,
the great profite that would redowne thereby: considering that all the
Countrey liued in assurance, and that they alone had not felt the <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omenique</hi>
Warre: and that finally the <hi>Etoliens</hi> would bee well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and ready to doe them honour vnto the vtmost of their ability
and power.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Acheins,</hi> they would giue them occasion of Warre, if
they sought to hinder their voyage: But if they did not budge, they
would passe easily to <hi>Messena:</hi> and for that the <hi>Messeniens</hi> had made
a promise to the <hi>Acheins</hi> and <hi>Macedonians,</hi> to enter into their league,
they gaue sufficient occasion of Warre.<note place="margin">Warre attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>Eto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Messeniens,</hi> the <hi>Epirotes, Acheins, Acarnaniens,</hi> and
<hi>Macedonians.</hi> Wherefore they presently sent forth many Pirates,
who encountred with the royall ship of <hi>Macedony,</hi> laden, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to <hi>Etolia,</hi> where they sold the Pilots and Marriners, and in the
end the ship.</p>
            <p>Then they ranne along the Empire, spoyling all those which
they met, being assisted by the <hi>Cephalonien</hi> Vessels, to commit
their outrages, taking Townes by Treason. For in <hi>Acarnania</hi> they
tooke <hi>Orea,</hi> and seized vpon a Castle which is in the midst of the
<hi>Megalopolitains</hi> Countrey, which they call <hi>Claire,</hi> by men whom
they had secretly sent into <hi>Morea:</hi> whereof making vse afterwards
for a retreate, they committed great spoiles at Sea. At that time
<hi>Timoxenes</hi> which was Chiefe of the <hi>Acheins,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Taurion taken by assault.</note> tooke the Towne of

            <p>You must vnderstand that King <hi>Antigonus</hi> held <hi>Corinthe</hi> with the

the which hee had taken by force, and had made himselfe Lord

of the Garrison of <hi>Orchomenes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dorimache</hi> and <hi>Scope</hi> making great choise of the time, when as
<hi>Timoxenes</hi> had not no many dayes to continue and stay in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy,
and that <hi>Arate</hi> who was to succeede him, could not execute
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:16537:97"/>
his office, they assembled the <hi>Etoliens</hi> neere vnto the Mountaine of
<hi>Rhie:</hi> and hauing prepared the <hi>Cephalonian</hi> ships, they sayled to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea:</hi>
and in passing by the Coasts of the <hi>Patrenses, Pharences,</hi> and <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenses,</hi>
they march against the <hi>Messeniens.</hi> It had beene forbidden
not to doe any outrage to the <hi>Acheins.</hi> But who can prescribe an
order to a multitude, who spoile all where they come? Comming
in the end to <hi>Phigalea,</hi> and making their attempt against the <hi>Messe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niens,</hi>
without any regard of their ancient Friendship, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any feare of God or Men, they ouer-runne and spoile the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
putting all to fire and sword. In the meane time the <hi>Messeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens</hi>
finding themselues too weake, kept themselues close within their
Towne.</p>
            <p>The time of election approaching for the <hi>Acheins,</hi> they assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at <hi>Egea,</hi> whereas holding their Diet, when as the Embassadours
of <hi>Patres</hi> on the one side, and those of <hi>Pharos</hi> on the other, made
their complaints for the outrages done by the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> and that on
the other side the <hi>Messeniens</hi> demanded Succours with great compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
they were induced, partly by the wrongs done vnto their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and moued partly with pitty, which they had of the <hi>Messeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,</hi>
being likewise discontented that the <hi>Etoliens</hi> had past their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
thorow their Countrey without their priuity, they resolued to
giue succours to the <hi>Messeniens,</hi> and thereby to accustome the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheins</hi>
to Warre: and what the assemblies should ordaine, should be
obserued. <hi>Timxenes</hi> chiefe of the <hi>Acheins,</hi> who was not yet depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
fearing to make any attempt, as if there were no other meanes
but the multitude: for that after the Warre of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> when
as all quarrels were pacified, hee knew well that the people of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea</hi>
were giuen to pleasure, and that making no more accompt of
Warre, they were growne idle.</p>
            <p>Contrariwise, <hi>Arate</hi> not able to endure the outrage done vnto his
Allies, and incensed the presumption of the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> remembring
in like manner their ancient hatred, hee made haste to cause the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheins</hi>
to take Armes, and to fight with the <hi>Etoliens.</hi> And therefore
fiue dayes before hee should enter into the Magistracy, hee receiued
the Seale from <hi>Timoxenes,</hi> and wrote vnto the Towne, willing them
to leuie men, and to assemble at <hi>Megalopolis.</hi> But before wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede.
I haue thought good to speake something of his nature and
disposition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arate</hi> was a man perfect in all things for the Gouernment of a City:
for hee spake well,<note place="margin">The disposition of <hi>Arate.</hi>
               </note> and had a good inuention; being also diligent,
and of execution: There was not his equall to endure a Ciuill dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
patiently, nor to contract leagues and alliances. Finally, hee
was a wise and discreet man in his Magistracy and charge, and to lay
Ambushes for his Enemy, bringing them vnto a good end by his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and patience. Whereof there are many proofes and testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
but especially for that he deliuered <hi>Sicyon</hi> and <hi>Mantinea</hi> to the
<hi>Acheins:</hi> and had taken <hi>Pellene</hi> from the <hi>Etoliens.</hi> hee likewise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
the strong Fort of <hi>Corinthe,</hi> which they call <hi>Acrocorinthe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:16537:97"/>
Yet if hee were to fight, he was carelesse to take Councell, and faint-hearted
in the fight.<note place="margin">The diuers Natures of men.</note> Wherefore he filled <hi>Morea,</hi> with the triumph
of the spoiles taken by him: so as Nature hath not onely framed a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity
in mens bodies, but also in their soules: So as many times
the same man doth not carry himselfe onely in diuers things, an able
man in some, and slacke in others: But also hee doth many times in
one and the same action make shew of extreame heate, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of incredible slacknesse: so as sometimes hee seemes a man of
great courage, and another time very fearefull. These are no strange
things, but vsuall, and well knowne vnto those that doe obserue
them. Wee likewise see many men in hunting to bee wonderfull
hardy against the cruellest sauage Beasts that can bee found: whom
if you leade to the Warre against the Enemy, would be found Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
and faint hearted. You shall likewise finde many in the Warre,
which are resolute to fight man to man, but in pitcht Battaile are
of no esteeme.</p>

to helpe and assist them, being so apparently wronged by the <hi>Etoliens:</hi>
and desiring withall if it were their good pleasure to bee receiued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their league, hereafter to beare the necessary charges for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
thereof. The cheife of the <hi>Acheins</hi> make answere, that
as for the alliance, they could not hearken vnto it, for that it was
not in their power and ability to receiue or fauour any one without
the consent of <hi>Philip</hi> and the other Allies: For that the accord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

so as they will giue their Children for hostages vnto the
<hi>Acheins:</hi> promising neuer to make peace, nor any accord with the
<hi>Etoliens,</hi> without the consent of the <hi>Acheins.</hi> It is true, the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians</hi>

When as <hi>Arate</hi> had thus concluded with the <hi>Messeniens,</hi> he sends

hauing heard the Embassadours charge, and being aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
of the preparation of the <hi>Acheins,</hi> thought good to yeeld vnto
<hi>Arate.</hi> Wherefore they sent Letters presently into <hi>Cylene</hi> to <hi>Aristo,</hi>
chiefe of the <hi>Etoliens</hi> requiring shipping: and two daies after they
parted, causing the Baggage to march before, taking their way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Elienses:</hi> a people which had beene alwayes faithfull to
the <hi>Etoliens.</hi> But <hi>Arate</hi> thinking simply they had gone away, as
they had resolued, gaue leaue to all his Bands to retire vnto their
houses: and went directly to <hi>Patras,</hi> accompanied onely with
three thousand Foote and three hundred Horse, which were vnder
the charge and command of <hi>Taurion,</hi> to cut off the Enemies
retreate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dorimache</hi> being aduertised, and fearing they should hinder the
passage, hee sent all the booty with a good Conuoy to the ships, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
charge to those which had the conduct, that they should come and
meete him at <hi>Rhie,</hi> where he had resolued to imbarke. When he
had conducted the booty a little way, hee presently turnes head
and comes to <hi>Olympia.</hi> Being there aduertised that <hi>Taurion</hi> was
about <hi>Clitoria</hi> with his Troupes, fearing that he should not be
able to imbarke at <hi>Rhie</hi> without fighting or danger, hee held it best
to fight presently with <hi>Arate,</hi> who had but small Troopes, and
was ignorant of his Enterprize. Hee conceiued that hee should make
his retreate safely that way which he had resolued, if he defeated the
Enemy, in running the whole Prouince, before the <hi>Acheins</hi> should
make a new head: and if they fled the Combate for feare, hee
should passe where hee pleased without danger. <hi>Dorimache</hi> moued
with these reasons, seated his Campe neere vnto <hi>Methydrie,</hi> which
is not farre from <hi>Megalopolis.</hi> The <hi>Acheins</hi> aduertised of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> made so little vse of those things which were
visible, as they forgot nothing that might augment and increase their
folly. First, in leauing <hi>Clitoria,</hi> they planted their Campe neere
vnto <hi>Caphies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when as the <hi>Etoliens</hi> parting from <hi>Methydrie,</hi> had pastat <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chomene,</hi>
the <hi>Acheins</hi> marcht by the Countrey of the <hi>Caphiens,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inclosed with a Riuer, as with a Rampier. The <hi>Etoliens</hi> fearing
to fight with the Enemy according to their first resolution, as well
for the difficulty of the places, (for there were before the Riuer Dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and inaccessible places) as for the comming of the <hi>Acheins.</hi> They
marcht vnto <hi>Olig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rte</hi> in good order, being loath that any one should
force them to runnne into danger. When as the Bands of Horse-men
followed them vpon a Plaine neere vnto them, <hi>Arate</hi> sent the Foot-men
that were lightly armed after the Horse-men, vnder the conduct
of <hi>Acarnane,</hi> giuing them charge to fight with them, and to trie
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:16537:98"/>
the Fortune wherein hee committed a great errour, for seeing hee
had an intent to fight, he should not haue charged them in the Reare,
for that they were not farre from the Mountaines, but in front, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they should haue gotten the top: By this meanes the Battaile had
beene in the Plaine. Whereby vndoubtedly the <hi>Etoliens</hi> had beene
defeated by reason of their kind of Armes and order. Contrariwise
<hi>Arate</hi> by bad aduice left vnto the Enemies the opportunity of the
place, and of time which was offred him. When as the <hi>Etoliens</hi> saw
the <hi>Acheins</hi> march, they vsed all diligence to gaine the Mountaine,
making haste to ioyne with their Foote-men. <hi>Arates</hi> men not duely
considering what had beene done, and being ignorant of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
enterprize, when they saw the Horse-men runne, they sent
those that were lightly armed of two wings, thinking it had beene a
flight: and giue them charge to succour the Horse and Foote. Then
<hi>Arate</hi> marched with the rest much discontented, making a long wing.
The <hi>Etolien</hi> Horse-men approaching to the Foote of the Mountaines,
began to march a slow pace, and called downe their Foote-men with
great cries: who comming suddainly to succour them, and seeing
they were not fewer in number then the Enemy,<note place="margin">A fight betwixt the <hi>Acheins</hi> and the <hi>Etoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens.</hi>
               </note> they turned head
against the <hi>Achein</hi> Horse-men, and charged them, for that they
had an aduantage in the number of men, and the opportunity of the
place.</p>
            <p>The Combate was fierce on either side, and the victory for a time
was in suspence. Finally, the <hi>Achein</hi> Horse-men, were repuls'd. And
when as they which were lightly armed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which had beene sent to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
them, met with them that fled, they were forced to doe the like
being amazed with this new accident, and partly broken by them that
fled. So as the defeate was but of fiue hundred, whereas the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>light
was of aboue two thousand. The <hi>Etoliens</hi> seeing plainely what they
had to doe, pursued the <hi>Acheins</hi> with cries and ioy. Who think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to finde their men in Battaile where they had left them, retired
to <hi>Arate.</hi> And therefore their flight in the beginning was honest,
and for their safety.<note place="margin">A defeate of the <hi>Acheins.</hi>
               </note> But when as they saw them dislodge, and to come
by files, and in disorder, then some flying here and there, sought for
their safety: others marching directly to their owne men, disordred
one another without any Enemy: Finally, they all flie, and saue
themselues in the neighbour Town<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were not farre off, otherwise they had beene all taken or slaine that
day. Thus the <hi>Acheins</hi> were defeated neere vnto <hi>Caphies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Megalopolitains</hi> being aduertised, that the <hi>Etoliens</hi> had plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their Campe neere vnto <hi>Methydrie,</hi> they assembled all with one
consent, and went to Field three dayes after the Battaile, to succour
the <hi>Acheins:</hi> but they were forced to bury those, with whom they did
hope to fight against the Enemy. And therefore they made a great
Ditch, wherein they put all the dead Bodies, and performed their
obsequies after the manner of the Countrey. The <hi>Etoliens</hi> being
Victors, past through <hi>Mroea</hi> without feare of danger. At what
time after they had sought diuers wayes to gaine the <hi>Pellenesiens,</hi> and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:16537:99"/>
had ruined the Country of the <hi>Sicyoniens,</hi> in the end they retired by the
streight of the <hi>Isthmus.</hi> These were the cause of the warre of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
whereof wee haue formerly spoken: whereof the beginning was
by a Decree which was afterwards made among the Allies, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
at <hi>Corinthe:</hi> where they were all assembled for that cause: <hi>Philip</hi>
King of <hi>Macedon</hi> consenting thereunto.</p>
            <p>Some few dayes after, the <hi>Acheins</hi> being assembled, they blamed
<hi>Arate</hi> both in publique and priuate, as if he had beene the cause of this
defeat and losse, and the Commons were the more inflamed, for that
the Enemies league made it to seeme greater. First, it seemed hee had
committed a great fault, to haue seazed vpon the Magistracie before his
time, and to haue made enterprizes doing another mans office: wherein
hee had many times before beene vnfortunate. But it seemed hee had
done worse, dissoluing the <hi>Acheins</hi> Army, the <hi>Etolien</hi> Commaunders
being still in the midst of <hi>Morea.</hi> Thirdly, that being ill accompanied,
he had giuen Battaile without force: considering that hee might easily
haue retired to the Neighbour Townes, vntill the <hi>Acheins</hi> had made a
new head: and then giue Battaile if he had thought it fit. Finally, that
hee had carried himselfe so inconsiderately, that in leauing the Plaines
(where without doubt his Men had beene the stronger) he had assailed
the Enemie in the Mountaines with Souldiers lightly armed: whereby
the <hi>Etoliens</hi> could haue no greater aduantage.</p>
            <p>Yet suddainly when as <hi>Arate</hi> was returned, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> into the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
and that he began to deliuer the things which he had formerly
done for the publique good, and had made knowne the causes of the last
Defeat, and giuen them to vnderstand that he was not the cause thereof,
as his Enemies had falsly slaundred him: and that finally hee would
haue craued pardon, letting them know that if hee had commited any
fault, the <hi>Acheins</hi> should not consider the euent of things, so bitterly nor
with such rigour, but with fauour and mildnesse, the opinion of the
Commons was suddainly so changed, as where before they seem'd to
be wonderfully incensed against <hi>Arate,</hi> they sodainly turned their chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
against his ill-willers, so as from that time they followed the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
and opinion of <hi>Arate.</hi> These things happened in the hundred and
nine and thirtieth Olympiade, and those which follow in the hundred
and fortieth.</p>
            <p>It was then resolued by the <hi>Acheins,</hi> to send Embassies to the <hi>Epirotes,
Peociens, Phocenses, Acarnaniens,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The aduice of the <hi>Acheins</hi> touching the warre against the <hi>Eteliens.</hi>
               </note> and to <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> to let
them vnderstand that the <hi>Etoliens</hi> had entred twice into <hi>Acheia,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the former accords: and likewise to demaund succours accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the league, and moreouer that the <hi>Messeniens</hi> might bee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
and that the chiefe of the <hi>Acheins</hi> might leauie fiue thousand
Foote, and fiue hundred Horse, and succour the <hi>Messeniens,</hi> if the <hi>Etoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens</hi>
did reassaile them. Finally, that he might agree with the <hi>Lacedem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
and <hi>Messeniens,</hi> touching the number of Foote and Horse, which
they should keepe ready for the common affaires of the league. After
these things thus resolued, the <hi>Achiens</hi> stomacking the Defeate whereof
we haue spoken, did not forget the <hi>Messeniens</hi> affaires, nor their resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:16537:99"/>
The Embassadours execute their charge diligently. The chiefe
likewise assemble the youth as it had beene decreed, and agree with
the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and <hi>Messeniens,</hi> that either of them should furnish
two thousand fiue hundred Foote, and two hundred and fifty Horse,
to the end that the whole might amount to ten thousand Foote, and a
thousand Horse. The time being come, when as the <hi>Etoliens</hi> were
to hold their Diet, they assembled the Commons, and consulted
how to make a peace with the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and <hi>Messeniens,</hi> and with
other people their neighbours, being forced partly by pouerty, and
partly weakned by the <hi>Acheins</hi> Allies. As for the <hi>Acheins,</hi> they
resolued to contract with them, if they would leaue the Alliance of
the <hi>Messeniens:</hi> But if they would hold it still, they were of aduice to
make Warre against them, which was a most idle and sencelesse thing.
For being allied to the <hi>Acheins</hi> aud <hi>Messeniens,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The idlenesse of the <hi>Etoliens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </note> they declared Warre
against the <hi>Acheins,</hi> if they contracted any Friendship or alliance with
the <hi>Messeniens:</hi> and contrariwise a peace was confirmed, if they held
them for their Enemies. And therefore their villany could not take
place, by reason of the contrariety of their subtill inuention.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Epirotes</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> hauing heard the Embassadours charge, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
the <hi>Messeniens</hi> into the league: and although they disliked the
outrages of the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> yet it seemed they made no great accompt of
it: for that they had done no new action, considering they had
beene accustomed to such things. Wherefore they willingly conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
a peace with them. Thus sometimes outrages growne old and
continued, are sooner pardoned then those of new date. The <hi>Etoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens</hi>
vsing this course of life, in ruining <hi>Greece</hi> by their incursions, and
making Warre many times before they declared it, did not vouchsafe
to answer to the complaints: Many times also they made no accompt,
and mockt at those which demanded satisfaction, for those things
which they had done, or would doe. And although that the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi>
had beene lately restored to liberty by <hi>Antigonus,</hi> by meanes
of the <hi>Acheins,</hi> hauing promised to <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> not
to attempt any thing against them, yet they sent an Embassie secretly
to the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> and confirmed friendship and alliance with them.</p>
            <p>When as the <hi>Acheins</hi> Army was assembled, and the succours of the
<hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and <hi>Messeniens</hi> ready, as it had beene decreed:<note place="margin">Scerdilaide <hi>and</hi> Demetrius.</note> 
               <hi>Scerdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laide,</hi>

Vessels, past to <hi>Lisse,</hi> contrary to the accord made with the <hi>Romans.</hi>
And attempting first to take <hi>Pyle,</hi> they were shamefully repuls'd after

<hi>Acheia</hi> with an Army of <hi>Etoliens</hi> and <hi>Sclauonians,</hi> the Towne
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:16537:100"/>
of the <hi>Sithians</hi> being of their party. <hi>Ariston</hi> chiefe of the <hi>Eto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liens</hi>
stayed at home, saying that he had peace and no warre with the
<hi>Acheins,</hi> as if hee had beene ignorant of the Enterprize: which was a
simple and idle course. Is there any thing more foolish, then to thinke
long to couer with words things that are plaine and euident? This done
<hi>Dorimache</hi> comes with his men to <hi>Cynethe</hi> with wonderfull speed. The
<hi>Cynethenses</hi> were tormented with great diuisions and seditions, hauing
beene long time <hi>Arcadiens:</hi> whereas many murthers had beene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
with Banishments, Rapes, and Spoiles: Finally it fell out, that
they which held the <hi>Acheins</hi> party, had the command of the Towne.
Wherefore their chiefe men, and the guards of their Towne were of
<hi>Acheia.</hi> Matters standing in this estate some yeares before the descent
of the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> when as the banished men had sent to them of the
Towne, intreating them to receiue them into grace and concord, the
Gouernours perswaded by their words, sent an Embassie to the <hi>Acheins,</hi>
desiring to make this peace and agreement with their Councell and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.
Whereunto the <hi>Acheins</hi> consented, for that they conceiued that
the affection and loue of the one and the other, would by this meanes
be more firme vnto them, considering that they which were within had
all their hope in them, and that the banished men would conceiue, that
they had beene preserued by the benefit of the <hi>Acheins:</hi> The <hi>Cyne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenses</hi>
sent backe the Garrison of the <hi>Acheins</hi> with their Captaine, and
called the banished men into their Towne, which were to the number
of three hundred, in taking their Faith with Oathes, whereby men may
be most religiously bound.</p>
            <p>But presently after they were receiued into the Towne, they resolued
among themselues to betray it, and to be reuenged on those which had
preserued them, without any consideration of the cause of this new pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise:
So as I am of opinion, that at the time when they sacrificed, and
gaue their Faith and Oathes, that euen then they resolued to contemne
the Gods, and vse cruelty towards those which had saued their liues: for
they had scarce set footing within the Towne, but they called the <hi>Etoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens</hi>
to deliuer it vnto them. The businesse was mannaged in this manner.
Some of the banished men, were created <hi>Polemarches:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Polemarches.</note> It is a Magistrate
which hath charge of shutting of the Gates, and keeping the keyes at

hauing their ladders and other things necessary, attended the execution
of the enterprize. The <hi>Polemarches</hi> slew their Companions which were
not of their faction, and opened the Gate. This done, the <hi>Etoliens</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
some by the Gate, some by Ladders. The whole Citie being
troubled by this new accident, ranne vp and downe full of feare and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation:
for that they could not runne to the Gate, for that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
cast themselues from the walls, neither could they goe to the walls,
for that they came by multitudes in at the Gate. And thus the <hi>Etoliens</hi>
tooke the Towne presently,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cynethe</hi> taken by the <hi>Etliens.</hi>
               </note> where among all the outrages which they
committed, they did one act of great iustice, for they slew all the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and spoiled their goods. The like they did to others, taking away
all their substance. Men were tormented to confesse their Goods, if
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:16537:100"/>
they had hidden away, and many others slaine. Hauing thus taken the
Towne, and after some fewe dayes leauing a sufficient Garrison, they
marcht with their Army towards <hi>Luses.</hi> Where approaching neere to
<hi>Diana's</hi> Temple, which is betwixt <hi>Clitoria</hi> and <hi>Cynethe,</hi> and is held by
the <hi>Grecians</hi> as a place of Freedome, they had an intent to carry away the
Cattell of the Goddesse, and to rauish all the Treasure of the Temple.
But the <hi>Lusiates</hi> offered them part to temper their wickednesse. The
which being receiued, the <hi>Etoliens</hi> parting from thence, planted their

            </p>
            <p>At that time <hi>Arate,</hi> chiefe of the <hi>Acheins,</hi> had sent an Embassie to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>

               </note> and taking their wayes againe towards <hi>Rhie,</hi> they
resolued to passe there. <hi>Taurion</hi> aduertised that the <hi>Etoliens</hi> marcht,
and of the ruine of <hi>Cynethe,</hi> and that <hi>Demetrius</hi> of <hi>Phareh,</hi> was come
from the <hi>Cyclades</hi> to <hi>Cenchrea,</hi> hee perswaded him to succour the <hi>Ache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins,</hi>
and to hinder the passage of the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> in transporting the ships by
the <hi>Isthmus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Demetrius</hi> had parted from the Iland with profit, but with little ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
for that the <hi>Rhodiens</hi> came against him with an Army at Sea, hee
yielded easily to <hi>Taurion:</hi> and the rather for that he furnished the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
expences the transport of the Shippes, wherefore after hee had
transported them, and was aduertised that the <hi>Etoliens</hi> were past two
dayes before, hee sail'd againe to <hi>Corinthe,</hi> after he had spoiled some of
the <hi>Etoliens</hi> Coasts: with whom the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> hauing secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
(as we haue said) they deferr'd to send the succours promised
by the accord, sending onely some Horse and foot for a colour. <hi>Arate</hi>
made shew to his people, that for the present hee would performe the
duty of a Citizen, rather then of a Captaine without any trouble, for the
remembrance of the losse which he had made, vntill that <hi>Scope</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimache</hi>
were retired, hauing ruined the whole Prouince, and what they
pleased: although it were no difficult thing to defeat them in their
rough and narrow passages. And although the <hi>Cynethenses</hi> had suffered
a wonderfull losse of all their goods, and were in a manner all slaine, yet
the world held them worthy of the punishment which they endured.</p>
            <p>And for that the people of <hi>Arcadia</hi> haue a certaine fame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne
of good men,<note place="margin">The customes of the <hi>Arcadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
               </note> not onely for their easie kinde of life, and their
good dispositions, and great honesty towards all the world, but also for
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:16537:101"/>
the honour and reuerence they beare vnto the Gods. I haue thought it
good to relate in few words, something concerning the rudenesse of the
<hi>Cynethenses,</hi> and to let the world vnderstand (seeing they were held to
be <hi>Arcadians</hi>) how they did so much differ from the other <hi>Grecians</hi> of
that time, in wickednesse and cruelty. For my part I thinke this hath
happened, for that they haue beene the first and the onely men which
among all the <hi>Arcadians</hi> haue neglected that which their Ancestors
had wisely inuented.</p>
            <p>It is certaine that Musique,<note place="margin">Musique pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to all the world.</note> (I meane true Musique) is profitable to all
the world, and necessary for the <hi>Arcadians:</hi> Neither is that true which
<hi>Ephorus</hi> (speaking without reason) writes in the Proeme of his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
that Musique is inuented to deceiue and abuse men: Neither must
wee thinke that the ancient <hi>Candyots</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> had without
reason, preferr'd the Flute and Songs before the Trumpet in Warre:
Neither had the ancient <hi>Arcadians</hi> Musique in so great honour in their
Common-wealth, as they not onely caused Children to learne it, but
also young men vnto the age of thirty yeares, who otherwise were rude
and vnciuill. It is no vnknowne thing, that in <hi>Arcadia</hi> alone, they did
accustome their children from their infancies, to sing praises in Hymnes,
by the which euery one did vse to commend the Angels of his Birth,
vertuous Men, and the Gods. And after all this they doe yearely make
Games to father <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, with Songs and Dances, instructed in the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines
of <hi>Philoxenes,</hi> and <hi>Tymotheus.</hi> And those of Children,<note place="margin">The Games of Children and Youth.</note> are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Games of Children, and the others the Games of Youth: Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
all their life is adicted to this kinde of singing, not so much for the
pleasure they take to heare the Musique, as to excite them to sing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Moreouer, if any one be ignorant in other Arts, it is held no
shame: but none of them may be ignorant of Musique: for they learne
it by necessity: Neither may he confesse that he vnderstands it not, for
that among them is reputed infamous. Finally, the young men doe
yearely present Shewes and Games in the Theater to the Burgesses,
with Songs and Dances, at the publique charge. Which things (in my
opinion) were wisely inuented by their Ancestors, Not for laciuious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
or delights, but for that they see the continuall toile of the people
in manuring the land, with a rudenesse and brutishnesse of life, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
with an austeere kinde of liuing, which proceedes from the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and roughnesse of the Ayre, to the which of necessity we growe
like.</p>
            <p>It is apparent that the Region of heauen, made Nations to differ in
their manner of liuing, in their forme and complexion, and in many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines.
Seeking then to make Nature pleasing and tractable, which
of it selfe seemes fierce and rude, they first propounded all those things
which we haue mentioned, and afterwards common assemblies, and
many sacrifices, where as men and women frequented, and finally dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of Virgins and Children. All which things they haue done to the
end that that which by Nature was rude in the hearts of men, might be
made milde and pleasing by custome.<note place="margin">The occasion of the ruine of <hi>Cynothenses.</hi>
               </note> But for as much as the <hi>Cyne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenses,</hi>
after some tract of time, became to disdaine these things, which
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:16537:101"/>
were aboue all things necessary for them, (inhabiting in the coldest part
of <hi>Arcadia</hi>) they grew in a short time to such a rudenesse of life, as there
was not any Citie in <hi>Greece,</hi> where there were more villanies and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
committed. The testimony of their wicked life is most manifest,
for that the other people of <hi>Arcadia</hi> detested their manner of liuing:
For at what time as they sent an Embassie to <hi>Sparta,</hi> after this great se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
in what Towne so euer they entred during their voyage, they
were chased away ignominiously, and forbidden to returne: and the
<hi>Mantiniens,</hi> after their departure, purged the Citie, and all places there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts
with sacrifices.</p>
            <p>We haue related these things, to aduise the Cities of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> not to
giue ouer the custome of their Countrey: and to the end men should
not thinke that they were so much giuen to the Musique of lasciuious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and that by this meanes no man should mocke at their custome: I
haue also done it for the loue of the <hi>Cynethenses:</hi> to the end (the Gods
permitting it) that in punishing them, they may leade a better life and
loue Musique, for it is the meanes by the which they may leaue
their naturall Rusticitie. Seeing then we haue spoken sufficiently of the
<hi>Cynethenses</hi> manner of liuing, and of their ruine, let vs returne where
we left.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Etoliens</hi> hauing ouer-runne all <hi>Morea,</hi> and put the Country to fire
and sword, returned to their houses. Finally, <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Philip <hi>comes to</hi> Corinthe.</note>
came to <hi>Corinthe</hi> succour the <hi>Achiens</hi> with an Army. But hearing
that all was past, he sends post to his Allies, aduising them to send men
vnto him to <hi>Corinthe,</hi> to conferre of their common affaires. In the

               <note place="margin">A mutinie among the <hi>Lacedomoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
               </note> for that he
was aduertised that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were in mutinie among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
And for that they had liued long vnder Kings, and had then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
their liberty vnder the conduct of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> being subiect to
no man, they fell into diuers factions, euery man seeking to haue autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in the Common-wealth aboue his fellow. There were two among
the Gouernours, which held their Councell so secret, as no man could
discouer it: the rest to the number of three, carried themselues openly
for the <hi>Etolien</hi> party, being confident that <hi>Philip</hi> considering his age,
could make no alteration in <hi>Morea.</hi> But when as contrary to their hope
and expectation, they had newes of the flight of <hi>Etoliens</hi> in <hi>Morea,</hi> and
of the comming of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon:</hi> These three Gouernours
of the Citie, hauing no confidence in one of the other two, called <hi>Adi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,</hi>
for that knowing their secrets, he seemed to dislike of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
and fearing that at the comming of <hi>Philip</hi> all would be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.
They declared themselues to certaine young men, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
caused all the people to assemble in Armes, at <hi>Iuno's</hi> Temple, by
the sound of the Trumpet, as if the <hi>Macedonians</hi> were come against the
<hi>Spartains:</hi> who suddainly assembled vpon this new accident.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adimant</hi> disliking this, came into the assembly, saying: The Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
should haue sounded some dayes past, and this assembly of men in
Armes should haue beene made, when as wee heard that the <hi>Etoliens,</hi>
Enemies to the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> approached their Mountaines, not now
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:16537:102"/>
when as we are aduertised, that the <hi>Macedonians</hi> our Benefactors and

the young men falling vpon him, slew him cruelly, with <hi>Sthenelaus, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camenes,

               <note place="margin">The Murther of the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi>
               </note> and diuers others. As for <hi>Polyphonte,</hi> hee
retired with his friends to <hi>Philip,</hi> hauing long before foreseene the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Things passing in this manner,<note place="margin">Ambassadours sent from <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemon</hi> to <hi>Philip.</hi>
               </note> the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Gouernours sent an
Embassie to the King to lay the wrong vpon them that were slaine, and
to perswade him to proceede no farther, vntill that all the troubles of
the Citie were pacified: Ciuing him to vnderstand, that the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi>
kept their faith and friendship with the <hi>Macedonians</hi> inuiolable.
The Ambassadours meeting the King neere vnto the Mountaine of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenia,</hi>
deliuered their charge. Who being heard, <hi>Philip</hi> aduised them
to returne speedily, and to aduertise the Gouernours that hee would
soone returne with his Army to <hi>Tegee,</hi> and that they should presently
send the chiefe of their Citie to <hi>Corinthe,</hi> to conferre of their present
affaires.</p>
            <p>By this meanes the Ambassadours being returned, and hauing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
them with <hi>Philips</hi> answere, the Gouernours sent him tenne of
the chiefe of the Citie, among the which <hi>Omias</hi> was the first, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to <hi>Tegee,</hi> and entring into the Kings priuie Councell, they vsed dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull
speeches of <hi>Adionant</hi> and his confederates: as if he had bin
the cause of this Mutinie. Finally, they omitted nothing, which they
thought fit to purchase the Kings loue, promising to doe any thing,
whereby it should appeare plainely, that they continued constant in the
Kings alliance and friendship.</p>
            <p>Hauing deliuered these things, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> went out of the
Councell. The <hi>Macedonians</hi> were of diuers opinions concerning
these affaires: for some being aduertised of the Enterprizes, which the
<hi>Spartains</hi> made with the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> being also of opinion, that <hi>Adimant</hi>
had beene slaine for the loue he bare vnto the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> beganne to
counsell the King, to make the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> an example to others, as
<hi>Alexander</hi> had done the <hi>Thebains,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> the great.</note> when he came to be King. The
other Senators said, that this kinde of punishment was more rigorous
then their deedes deserued, and that they should onely let the offenders
know their offence, and depriue them of the gouernment of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale,
and giue it to his friends. All which being heard, the King
deliuered his opinion, (if it be credible that it was his owne) for it is not
likely that a young man who had scarce attained the age of seauenteene
yeares, could giue iudgement in so great affaires. But it becomes a Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storiographer
to attribute the resolution taken in Councell to Princes,
by whose will all things are gouerned. So they which read or heare
this History, must conceiue that these kinde of sentences proceede from

them by words or letters: But if they offended their Allies openly,
they must receiue a publique punishment, and that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi>
had not infringed the common alliance in any thing, but contrariwise
had offred to doe all things for the <hi>Macedonians:</hi> and that moreouer
hee must not study to intreate them worse, considering that it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
reason, to take reuenge on those for a light cause, who being
Enemies his Father had pardoned. The Kings Sentence being confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<hi>Petreus</hi> a Friend to <hi>Philip,</hi> was presently appointed to goe

of <hi>Greece,</hi> where as all with one voice, had the actions of the
<hi>Etoliens</hi> in execration. The <hi>Beociens</hi> charged them that in the time
of peace they had spoyled <hi>Minerua's</hi> Temple: and the <hi>Phocenses</hi>
that hauing planted their Campe neere vnto <hi>Ambryse</hi> and <hi>Daulia,</hi>
they had a resolution to take them. The <hi>Epiretes</hi> shewed that they
had put all their Countrey to fire and sword: the <hi>Acarnanians</hi> that
they had attempted to take a very rich Towne in the Night by <hi>Scala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe.</hi>
Finally, the <hi>Acheins</hi> propounded, that they had taken <hi>Caria</hi>
belonging to <hi>Megalopolis:</hi> That they had ouer-run and spoiled the

            <p>The Councell of the Allies hearing these things, all with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

Conncell,<note place="margin">Warre conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded against the <hi>Etoliens.</hi>
               </note> that all they should bee receiued into the league, whose

of <hi>Demetrins,</hi> who was Father to <hi>Philip.</hi> And that moreouer they
which through the necessity of the time had beene forced to make an
alliance with the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> should be restored to their former liberty,
and it should bee lawfull for them to liue according to the Lawes and
customes of their owne Countries. Finally, they ordained that the
<hi>Amphictions</hi> should bee restored to their Lawes,<note place="margin">The <hi>Amphicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
               </note> and haue the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendency

who had made themselues Lords. When as these things had beene
thus resolued, the first yeare of the hundred and fortieth Olympiade,
suddainly the Warre of the Allies was kindled, which tooke its iust
beginning from the outrages done by the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> whereof we haue
spoken. They that were in the assembly, sent presently to the Allies,
to aduertise them, that according vnto that which had beene or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned,
euery one for his part should make Warre against the
<hi>Etoliens.</hi> Moreouer, <hi>Philip</hi> writes vnto the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> that if they
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:16537:103"/>
would answere any thing to that they were charged, they should
send vnto him: And that they were mad with folly, if spoiling and rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
all the World without any open Warre, they which were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly
wronged, would not seeke reuenge: and that in doing so, they
would be held to begin the Warre. The <hi>Etoliens</hi> hauing receiued these
Letters, making no stay for the Kings comming, appointed a day to
goe to <hi>Rhie,</hi> to meete the King. But when as they were aduertised of
that which had beene concluded in the assembly, they sent a Post vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the King, to let him vnderstand that they could not resolue any thing
concerning the affaires of the Common-weale, before the <hi>Etoliens</hi> had
called an assembly.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Acheins</hi> hauing held their Diet at <hi>Egia</hi> according to their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,
they confirmed the resolution: and presently signified Warre
to the <hi>Etoliens.</hi> In the meane time <hi>Philip</hi> comming to <hi>Egia,</hi> vsed a
gracious and friendly Speech vnto them, the <hi>Acheins</hi> embraced his
words with great affection, renuing that ancient Friendship which they
had held with his Predecessours. At that time the day of the Election
was come, and the <hi>Etoliens</hi> had made choice of <hi>Scope</hi> for their
Captaine,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Scope</hi> chosen Head of the <hi>Etoliens.</hi>
               </note> who had beene the first Author of the former alterations.
Wherevpon I know not what to say: for a warre mannaged by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
consent; a spoile committed by souldiers vpon al their neighbours;
not to punish such crimes; to aduance and honour the Captaines, and
Heads of such actions, seemes to mee an absolute villany. For how
can wee otherwise call this kind of Malice? That which I say, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest

<hi>Lacedemonians</hi> punished the Authour of the Crime, yet they did not
with-draw their Garrisons: as on the other side, it is fit to make satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for the vniust wrongs committed. The <hi>Thebains</hi> did other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise:
For when as by a publique edict, they had restored the Townes
to their liberty, and to their owne Lawes, according to the <hi>Antalci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi>
peace, yet they did not depriue the Magistrates. And when as
hauing a league with the <hi>Mantiniens,</hi> they had ruined them, they said
they had done them no wrong, for that they had transported them from
one Towne into many. Hee is simple, and accompanied with Malice,
who shutting his owne eyes,<note place="margin">Enuy the cause of great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe.</note> thinkes he is not seene. Beleeue me, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy
hath beene a great occasion of the mischiefe of these two Citties:
the which no man of iudgement should follow in his priuate or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique

hee retired into <hi>Macedony</hi> with his Army, to leuie men, and to make
necessary preparations for the Warre. Finally, hee left a great hope
of Clemency, not onely in the Allies, but throughout all <hi>Greece,</hi> for
the conclusion which was generally confirmed.</p>
            <p>These things were done at such time as <hi>Hannibal</hi> chiefe of the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians,</hi>

haue begun to draw vnto the same end. By this meanes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of euery part is more manifest, and the vniting of all more plaine.
You must vnderstand, that they were intermixt and turned to the same
end, in the third yeare of the hundred and fortieth Olympiade. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we will relate in common that which followed. As for that which
was before this time, we haue deliuered it in particular, euery thing in
its place in the last Booke: to the end that the time should not only fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
but there should be an vnion of all things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philip</hi> wintring in <hi>Macedony,</hi> made a new leuie of men, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
prouisions for the Warre: he fortified the Townes against
the attempt of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> which dwelt about <hi>Sparta.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he went to <hi>Scardilaide,</hi> with whom hee made a league, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
him aide and succours to pacifie the affaires of <hi>Sclauonia:</hi> and in
blaming the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> he perswaded him to what he would:<note place="margin">The difference betwixt a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique iniury.</note> For a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
iniury doth not differ from a publique, but by the number and
greatnesse of things which happen. It is also an ordinary thing that
the alliance of wicked men is easily broken, if Equity and Iustice bee
not obserued. The which happened at that time to the <hi>Etoliens.</hi> You
must vnderstand, that when as they had compounded with <hi>Scerdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laide,</hi>
that the Booty should bee equally diuided, if hee would fall
vpon the <hi>Acheins</hi> with them; who giuing credit to their words,
marcht with them to <hi>Cynethe,</hi> where after the taking and razing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
the <hi>Etoliens</hi> carried away great store of Gold, and a great number
of Cattell, diuiding the Booty among themselues, whereof they did
frustrate <hi>Scerdilaide.</hi> Wherefore he grew into choller and indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and when as <hi>Philip</hi> put him in minde thereof, hee suddainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
the alliance vnder these Conditions: that he should haue twelue
thousand Crownes yearely, and should saile with thirty ships, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Warre by Sea against the <hi>Etoliens.</hi> Behold the things with such like
which <hi>Philip</hi> contriued. In the meane time the Embassadours sent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Allies arriued, first in <hi>Acarnania:</hi> whereas letting them vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what they were enioyned, they presently and freely confirme
what had beene decreed, and make Warre against the <hi>Etoliens:</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they had beene to bee pardoned, if they had forborne longer
then the rest: considering that for their neighbourhood, they seemed to
haue iust cause of feare, and that they had formerly had experience of
what consequence the hatred of the <hi>Etoliens</hi> was vnto them, and for
that they alone might be ruined. It is true, and I am of opinion, that
honest men, and such as respect their honour, should hold nothing
more deare, then to giue order that their duty may in no sort be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,<note place="margin">The commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the <hi>Acarnanians.</hi>

<hi>Greclans,</hi> although they had but a small beginning: whereby it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that no man should forbeare to make this people a Companion in
his affaires: for they haue naturally something in them that is generous
and noble, and desirous of liberty. The <hi>Epirotes</hi> on the other side, after
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:16537:104"/>
they had heard what the Embassadours had in charge, they allowed of
the resolution: Yet they made answere, that they would not make War
against the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> before they were aduertised that <hi>Philip</hi> had begun
it. And afterwards they made answer to an Embassie of the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> that
they had decreed to maintaine peace with them, shewing themselues
in such affaires fearefull and inconstant. For they sent Embassadours
vnto King <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> to intreate him not to furnish the <hi>Etoliens</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

to endure, and suffer all things rather then to enter into it. But why

who in his Poefies exhorts the Burgesses, that in neglecting all other

for peace, hee defines it to bee the end of rest and a cleare light. But
when as hee thought to haue spoken with great perswasions, soone
after hee deliuered a sentence, the most scandalous and incommodious
thing in the World. It is true that peace is a most excellent thing, if
it bee iust and honest. Yet wee may not doe an vnreasonable act, nor
suffer an infamy to enioy it. It is certaine that the Gouernours and
chiefe men of <hi>Messene,</hi> hauing a regard to their priuate profits, were
much inclined to peace, which was not reasonable. Wherefore as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the times were propitious vnto them, according to their desires,
and sometime dangerous, they fell continually into the same inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience:
so as alwayes hauing the same resolution to keepe the peace,
they many times brought their Countrey into great danger. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

whom they had beene continuall Enemies, yet they did not openly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
themselues as Enemies to the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> or Friends to the <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians:</hi>
By this meanes they liued in peace, when as the said Citties made
war betwixt themselues, or with other. But when as the <hi>Lacedem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nians</hi>
(after they had made a peace with their other enemies) ran vpon them,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:16537:104"/>
they were forced to serue them with ignominy: or abandon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
with their Wiues and Children, to auoide seruitude: Considering
that they were not able with their owne forces to resist the power of
the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> nor to defend themselues with the helpe and succor
of the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> whose Friendship they were not able to keepe.
The which hath often happened vnto them of late yeares. I pray
vnto God if it bee his will, that the estate wherein the affaires of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea</hi>
now stands, may be such, as that which wee haue to say, may not
take place. Yet if there happen any alteration, I see but one hope
for the <hi>Messeniens</hi> and <hi>Megalopolitains,</hi> to preserue and defend their
Countrey, if following the sentence of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> they liue
alwayes well vnited, and gouerne their Councels and Affaires with
one consent, whereof they haue ancient testimonies of the truth.
The <hi>Messeniens</hi> as <hi>Calistines</hi> doth report, erected a Pillar in the
Temple of <hi>Iupiter</hi> of <hi>Lyce,</hi> in the time of <hi>Aristomenes,</hi> on the which
these Verses were ingrauen.
<q>
                  <l>Time on a wicked King hath vengeance showne,</l>
                  <l>The Traytour to the Messaine state <hi>Ioue</hi> hath made knowne:</l>

                  <l>Of <hi>Ioue,</hi> who fauours the <hi>Arcadian</hi> state.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>You must vnderstand that for as much as they had beene chased from
their Countrey, they wrote these Verses, as meaning to pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Gods for their second Countrey. For the which in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
they had good reason. For the <hi>Arcadians</hi> not onely receiued
them into their Citty, during the Warre of <hi>Aristomenes,</hi> being ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
and chased away, making them Burgesses, and assisting them
with Councell and Wealth: But they also suffered them to marry
their Daughters vnto their Sonnes. Moreouer, hauing examined the
Treason of King <hi>Aristocrates,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aristocrates.</note> they not onely put him cruelly to
death, but punished all the Race proceeding from so wicked a stocke.
But leauing the times past, let vs come to things of a fresher Date, and
are happened since this alliance betwixt the two Citties, which gaue
sufficient testimony of that which we haue spoken.</p>
            <p>You must vnderstand that at what time the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> began
(after that great Victory which the <hi>Grecians</hi> had neere vnto <hi>Mantinea</hi>
by the death of <hi>Epaminondas</hi>) to enter into hope to make the <hi>Messe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niens</hi>
subiect, not comprehending them in the accord, the <hi>Megalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politains</hi>
and all the Citties of the league tooke these things so to heart
for the <hi>Messeniens,</hi> as presently they receiued them into their Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and excluded the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> alone of all the <hi>Grecians.</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
standing in this estate, who will not thinke but wee had reason to
say that which wee haue formerly spoken? Wee haue continued this
discourse of the <hi>Arcadians</hi> and <hi>Messeniens</hi> at length, to the end
that remembring the outrages which the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had many
times done them, they should continue alwayes true and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
in their Faith and Friendship: and that for no feare of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:16537:105"/>
their affaires, nor for any desire of peace, they should neuer aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
one another when it concernes their safety. But let vs returne now
to the discourse where we left.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> according to their manner of liuing, sent backe
the Embassadours of the league without any answere: they were so sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
and ouer-weening. Wherefore I hold that to bee true, which is
commonly spoken, that ouer-weening doth many times make men
mad, and drawes them to ruine. After all these things, when as the
new Megistrates were created, they which in the beginning made that
sedition in the Common-wealth, and were the cause of the Murthers
before mentioned,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Machate</hi> sent Embassadour from the <hi>Eto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liens</hi> to the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians.</hi>
               </note> sent to the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> requiring them to send an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassie.
The which when they had easily obtained, and that <hi>Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi>
Embassadour for the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> was come to <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> they goe
presently to the Gouernours of the Citty, telling them, that they
must assemble the people to heare this Embassie, and to create accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the custome of the Countrey: and that they must no longer suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Empire of the <hi>Heraclidis</hi> to be lost, contrary to the Lawes of the
Citty. And although the Gouernours were discontented to see the
present estate of their affaires, yet not able to resist their force, fearing
also the young men, they made answere, that as for Kings they would
aduise of it afterwards, and presently they would assemble the people
to heare <hi>Machate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The assembly being made, they caused <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

to perswade them to imbrace the alliance of the <hi>Etoliens:</hi> blaming
the <hi>Macedonians</hi> much without reason, and speaking many false things
in praise of the <hi>Etoliens.</hi> Hauing ended his speech, there was a long
debate among the people, and their opinions were diuers: for some
held it fit to follow the <hi>Etolien</hi> party, and to embrace their alliance:
others were of a contrary opinion, insisting that they should preserue
the Friendship of the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> Finally, after that some Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
were risen, and had put them in minde of the benefits of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus,</hi>
and of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and of the losse they had in the time of

and put all to fire and sword, attempting to surprize the Towne,
restoring the banished men by force and policy, they caused many to
change their opinion: and in the end the people were perswaded to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
their Friendship with <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> Matters thus
decided, <hi>Machate</hi> returnes into <hi>Etolia,</hi> hauing effected nothing of that
for which hee came. The Heads of this Mutiny, whereof wee haue
spoken, being discontented herewith, began to plot a most cruell En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize.</p>
            <p>Soone after the Youth were to assemble in Armes, to performe a
Sacrifice which was done yearely, after the manner of the Countrey in
<hi>Pallas</hi> Temple, where the Gouernours of the Citty had the authority,
and continued some dayes in the Temple. Wherefore they corrupted
some of the Yong men which should be there in Armes with gifts. who
at a time appointed amongst them, seeing the Gouernors busie at the
Sacrifices, should assaile them suddainly, and kill them like Sheepe. And
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:16537:105"/>
although they were in the Temple, the which the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
as a Sanctuary, and where all malefactors,<note place="margin">The murther of the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian</hi> Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours by the young men.</note> (although they were
condemned to dye) were in safety, yet the insolence of men was growne
to so great a cruelty, as they slew all the Magistrates before the Altars,
and on the Tables of the Goddesse. The like they did afterwards to
the Senators, which had followed the opinion of <hi>Herides.</hi> Finally, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they had chased out of their Citie those that were opposite to the
<hi>Etoliens,</hi> they created new Magistrates of their owne faction: making a
league with the <hi>Etoliens.</hi>
               <note place="margin">A league made betweene the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and <hi>Etoliens.</hi>
               </note> By this meanes they declared themselues at

They had a great hope in the loue of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> whose comming
they expected with great affection. Beleeue mee, the mildnesse and
courtesie of Princes hath so great power,<note place="margin">The power of clemoncie in Princes.</note> as it leaues in the hearts of
men, not onely by their presence, but also by their absence, a generall
zeale of loue and good will towards them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> hauing the Gouernment of their Common-wealth,
almost for the space of three yeares, after that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> had
beene chased away, they neuer thought of chusing a King: But when
they had newes of his death, they had an humour to chuse one: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the first Authors of this practise, were the heads of the sedition, who
had made the league with the <hi>Etoliens.</hi> Wherefore they elected (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their lawes and customes) for one of their Kings, one named
<hi>Agesipoles,</hi> being yet very young, the sonne of <hi>Agesipoles,</hi> who was sonne
to <hi>Cleombrotus.</hi> It happened that he raigned at such time, as <hi>Leonides</hi>
was deposed from the Magistracie: for that hee was the neerest of that
race. And they gaue him for Tutor <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Cleombro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>

sixe hundred Crownes.</p>
            <p>Thus you see that all wicked things haue alwayes beene set to saile.
But it was not long but the heads of this crime suffered the punishment
of their folly and ouer-weening. <hi>Machate</hi> aduertised of that which
had beene done at <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> returnes againe to <hi>Sparta,</hi> and perswades
the Kings and Magistrates to make warre against the <hi>Acheins,</hi> saying, that

When as the Kings and Magistrates were perswaded by his

and some other of their Burroughes, putting all the Countrey to fire and

against the <hi>Acheins.</hi> And in the meane time <hi>Mahbate</hi> went to the other
neighbour Townes, perswading them as he had done the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
By this meanes the <hi>Etoliens</hi> (to whom all things succeeded hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily)
vndertooke the warre boldly. Contrariwise, all things were

from <hi>Macedon</hi> with his Army, hauing about tenne thousand Leginaries,
and fiue thousand men arm'd with Targets, and about eight hundred
Horse. This was the preparation for warre at that time. The <hi>Rhodiens</hi>
made warre at the same time against the <hi>Constantinopolitains</hi> for some
such causes.<note place="margin">The scituation of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi>
               </note> The <hi>Constantinopolitains</hi> inhabit a City strong by scituation,
and wonderfull commodious to finde all things that may giue content
vnto man: For it is so well seated vpon the Gulfe of <hi>Pontus,</hi> as no Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
can enter nor goe forth, but at the mercy of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> And
as the Pontique Sea, brings any things necessary for man, the <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolitains</hi>
are the Masters: for the Countries there-abouts supplies
them with great aboundance of Leather for their common vse, and a
great multitude of Stags, and they send to vs honey for daintinesse, wax,
flesh salted, and such like things: They draw also from vs other things
which abound in our Countries, as Oyles, and all sorts of Wines: Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they furnish Wheat, and we doe the like to them.</p>
            <p>These are the things whereof the <hi>Grecians</hi> make vse, or else the vent
would bee vnprofitable vnto them; whereas the <hi>Constantinopolitains</hi>
should shew themselues malicious in allying themselues to the <hi>Gaules,</hi> or
to any other barbarous Neighbours: So as the <hi>Grecians</hi> should be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to abandon the Pontique Sea, for the straightnesse of the places, and
the multitude of <hi>Barbarians.</hi> Wherefore the <hi>Constantinopolitains</hi> haue
great commodities by reason of their scituation, transporting those
things whereof they abound, and drawing vnto them what they want
without any paine or danger. They are also very profitable to the
other Cities of <hi>Greece.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Grecians</hi> did honour and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:16537:106"/>
esteeme them worthy, to whom they not onely giue thanks, but they
are bound to giue them Succours against the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> as doing good
to all men. We haue thought good to shew the cause, why this Citie
is so happy: for that there are many which know not the nature and
property of the place: and it hath beene alwayes our desire, that such
things might come to the knowledge of many: and that if it might be,
they might be visible to the eye, if not, yet at the lest as much as should
be possible, they might be comprehended in the vnderstanding.</p>
            <p>The Sea then which they call Pontique,<note place="margin">The circuit of the Pontique Sea.</note> hath in circuit two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thousand furlongs, or there-abouts, hauing two mouthes opposite one
to the other: whereof the one comes from <hi>Propontis,</hi> and the other
from the blacke Sea, the which hath in circuit eight thousand furlongs.
But for that diuers great Riuers fall from <hi>Asia</hi> into it, and more out of
<hi>Europe,</hi> it sometimes flowes into the Pontique Sea by its mouth, and
from thence into <hi>Propontis.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bosphorus Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meriques.</note> The Mouth of the blacke Sea is called
<hi>Bosphorus Cimeriques,</hi> and is thirty furlongs broad, and threescore in
length.</p>
            <p>As for the mouth of the Pontique Sea, it is called the streight of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>
whose length is not in euery place equall: for from the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pontis</hi>
the space betwixt <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> containes foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
furlongs, and from the Pontique Sea, the which they call <hi>Fanum,</hi>
scituated in <hi>Asia</hi> (whereas <hi>Iason</hi> first as they sacrificed to the twelue
Gods, returning from <hi>Cholchos</hi>) is distant from <hi>Europe</hi> tenne furlongs.
Moreouer,<note place="margin">Two causes why the black Sea and the Pontique run continually.</note> they deliuer two reasons, why the blacke Sea and the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
runne continually: whereof the one is well knowne, for that the
water encreaseth by the multitude of Riuers which fall continually into
it, and hauing no other meanes to voide it, it must of necessity encrease,
so as it is forced to passe away by its mouth. The other is, that the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
is fill'd with aboundance of sand, which the Riuers bring conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
into it: so as the water is forced to swell, and so to passe away.
These are the true causes of their course, which neede not the relation of
Marchants to purchase credit, but onely of naturall reason, which is the
truest testimony that can be found.</p>
            <p>But seeing wee are fallen vpon this discourse, wee must not omit any
thing, (as many Historiographers doe) to seeke out the secrets of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
and wee must vse (as much as possibly wee may) a demonstratiue
relation, to the end wee may leaue nothing in doubt to those which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to vnderstand. Neither were it sitting in these times, (when as all
things haue beene discouered) to seeke the testimony of Poets or fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Writers in doubtfull things: the which former Historiographers
haue done.</p>
            <p>By this meanes, as <hi>Heraclides</hi> saith, they haue not propounded testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
worthy of credit, in doubtfull things, and which are in debate.
Wee therefore say that the Pontique Sea fills it selfe continually with
sand, which the Riuers bring into it, and that in time it will be made
euen with the land. The like we say of the blacke Sea, so as the scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of places continue as wee see them at this day, and that the causes
of the sand which fall continually into it cease not. For seeing the time
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:16537:107"/>
is infinite, and the bottomes whereof wee speake are enclosed with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
limits, it is manifest, that by a long succession of time, they would
be fill'd vp by the descent of that which falls into them, bee it neuer so
little, so as it continues. And for that the sands which are brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, are of no small quantity, but in a manner infinite, it is apparent
that what wee say will soone happen: and wee see it partly already, for
that the blacke Sea is in a manner fill'd vp: for, the greatest depth hath
not aboue fiue fathome, or seauen at the most, wherefore they cannot
saile without great Ships, vnlesse the Marriners towe them off by their
Masts. And although in the beginning the blacke Sea was like vnto the
Pontique in taste, as the Ancients confesse, Yet it is now a very sweete
Marish: for that the sea hath beene surmounted by aboundance of
sands, and the many sweete Riuers which fall into it. The like will
happen to the Pontique, and begins already: But it cannot be so easily
discouered by reason of the great depth. And yet if we shall obserue it
well,<note place="margin">The Danowe.</note> we shall finde it euident: for there are made within it by the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
(which by the descent is carryed, for that the <hi>Danowe</hi> enters by
many mouthes) hills which the Marriners call Shelfes, a daies iourney
from the shore:<note place="margin">The shelfes in the Sea.</note> where many times in the night they suffer Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke.</p>
            <p>Behold the cause why these Shelfes are rather made farre within the
Sea, then neere the shore: for the greater force the Riuer hath in their
course, driuing the waues into the sea, it is necessary that the sand and
other substance should be carried farre into it: And whereas the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the Riuers ceaseth by reason of the depth of the Sea, rather then
by a naturall reason, all the sands sinke and findes a bottome where it
stayes. Wherefore it happens that the shelfes of swiftest Riuers are
found farthest into the Sea, and their depth neere vnto the shore: where
as they which haue a slow course, are not farre from the mouth. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
wee must not wonder at the great quantity of wood, stone, and
sand, which is carried into the Pontique Sea: for that many times wee
see a torrent or land flood ouerflowe a great Countrey in a short time,
carrying away earth and stone. So as it sometimes happens, there is
such an alteration made of a great Countrey, as in seeing it soone after,
we doe scarce know it. Wherefore wee must not wonder, if so many
and such great Riuers fall continually into the Pontique Sea, in the end
fill it vp: for this is not onely likely, but also necessary, if wee will dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
examine the reason, the likelihood it should proue so, is great,
for as much as the Pontique Sea differs from ours, for that the blacke
Sea is sweeter. Wherefore it followes, that when as the Pontique
Sea hath past as much more time as the blacke, for that it is of a greater
depth, it will be sweet and moorish like vnto it: and the sooner, for that
there are more Riuers, and greater fallen into it. Wee haue spoken
these things for those which thinke that the Pontique Sea cannot bee
fill'd vp, nor become moorish, being now a full Sea. Wee haue like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
done it, for that Saylors report such variety of lyes, to the end that
like children we should not alwayes giue credit vnto them, for that wee
haue not visited the places: and that hauing some knowledge of the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:16537:107"/>
trueth, we may discouer whether that which they relate be true or false.
But let vs returne to the commodity of the scituation of <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
as the length of the Sea, which ioynes the Pontique, and the <hi>Propontis</hi>
hath sixe score furlongs, and that <hi>Fanum</hi> limits the part which is from
the Pontique Sea, and <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other which is from the <hi>Propontis,</hi> there stands a Temple be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
both, which they call the refuge of <hi>Europe,</hi> seated vpon a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory
on the mouth of the Pontique Sea, and is distant from <hi>Asia</hi>
fiue furlongs. It is scituated vpon the greatest streight of the Sea,
where as King <hi>Darius</hi> made a Bridge as they report,<note place="margin">King <hi>Darius.</hi>
               </note> at such time as hee
made a descent against the <hi>Sythians.</hi> From the Pontique Sea vnto this
place the Waues runne equally, for that the shores of either side are
of one distance.<note place="margin">The refuge of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </note> But when it comes to the refuge of <hi>Europe,</hi> where
(as we haue said) the Sea is narrowest, the Water of the Pontique Sea
beats violently vpon the opposite Country, and those places of <hi>Asia</hi>
which are right against it: Then it doubles its course, against the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory
of <hi>Europe</hi> neere vnto the Altars; and then it falls into the
Country which the inhabitants call <hi>Oxe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Country of the <hi>Oxe.</hi>
               </note> This stands in <hi>Asia</hi> whereas
<hi>Io</hi> (hauing past the Sea first) staied, as fables report. Yet in the end
it takes its course to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> hauing bin beaten backe by the
<hi>Oxe.</hi> Whereas dispersing it selfe about the City, it partly diuides it
sylfe, and seperates that place which they call the Horne; and on the
other side it flowes againe in its owne course. Yet this violence cannot
passe into that Country which is right against it, where <hi>Calcedon</hi>
stands: For where as it makes so many turnings here and there, and that
the Gulfe is of no small breadth, it failes in a manner in this place, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to the opposite part, not in a direct Line but bending: So as lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<hi>Calcedon,</hi> it takes its course by the Gulfe. This drawes so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Commodities to the <hi>Constantinopolitains,</hi> and the contrary to the
<hi>Calcedonians.</hi> And although it be apparent that the scituation of these
two Cities are equally commodious, yet the passage is difficult for
those which will saile to <hi>Calcedon.</hi> Contrariwise they are carried to
<hi>Constantinople</hi> by the violence of the Waues: So as it seemes that they
which will goe from <hi>Calcedon</hi> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> cannot Saile directly
thither by reason of the Violent course of the streame: And therefore
they recouered the <hi>Oxe,</hi> and the Towne which they call <hi>Chrysopolis,</hi>
from whence they are afterwards Transported by force vnto <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chrysopolis.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Finally the <hi>Constantinopolitans</hi> haue a good commodity to Saile any
way,<note place="margin">The commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> by the Sea of <hi>Abydos</hi> and <hi>Sestes.</hi>
               </note> whither they bend to <hi>Hellesponte</hi> with a Southerly Winde, or
else from the Pontique Sea to <hi>Hellesponte.</hi> You must vnderstand that
the direct and common course from <hi>Constantinople</hi> to the streights of
<hi>Propontis,</hi> is by <hi>Abydos</hi> and <hi>Sestes;</hi> and in like manner from the streights
to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> But it fals out otherwise with the <hi>Calcedonians,</hi> for
the reasons which we haue mentioned, and for the distance of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the <hi>Cyziceneins;</hi> for it is a difficult thing for them which Saile
from <hi>Hellesponte</hi> to <hi>Calcedon,</hi> to keepe the Coast of <hi>Europe,</hi> and in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
the Country neere vnto <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to turne vnto <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:16537:108"/>
for the violent course of the streame. And againe, it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to Saile from thence into <hi>Thrace,</hi> as well for the violence of the
Waues, which go crosse, as the contrariety of the Windes, for a
Southerly winde is good for those which enter into the Pontique Sea,
and the contrary for such as go foorth; and these two winds only serue
to go in,<note place="margin">The continuall Warre of the <hi>Constantinopoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> with the <hi>Thracians.</hi>
               </note> and come out. These are the things whereby the <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politains</hi>
draw such great commodities from the Sea.</p>
            <p>Now we will shew the discommodities which the City is to suffer
by reason of the firme Land. <hi>Thrace</hi> enuirons the Country of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi>
in such sort, as it imbraceth it from Sea to Sea. So as they
are in perpetuall Warre with the <hi>Thracians:</hi> For although they get a
Battaile or two against this cruell and barbarous Nation, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
quench the Wars, the multitude of people and Princes is so great:
For that after they haue gotten Victory ouer one, there doth suddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
arise three other mighty Princes, who ouer-runne the Country for
spoile: Neither can they doe any thing to haue an accord, or to pacifie
the Warre by paying of Tribute; for presently they find their Enemies
multiplied. And therefore they are wasted and consumed with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
and cruell Warre. But what can you finde more disloyall then a
neighbour enemy? Nor a Warre more dangerous then with a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Nation? And with all these miseries wherewith they are oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by Land, they are moreouer tormented with <hi>Tantalus</hi> paine, as
the Poets feigne: For the <hi>Barbarians</hi> (considering that they haue a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Region) ouer-run the Country and spoile it, after that the Land
hath bin well manured, and that the fruite which is very beautifull, and
in abundance, is in Season.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Constantinopolitains</hi> seeing so great a spoile of their goods, and
the losse of their labour and charges, are wonderfully grieued. Yet
bearing this War with the <hi>Thracians</hi> by a Custome, they alwaies held
their auncient accord with the <hi>Gracians.</hi> But when as the <hi>Gaules</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
to be their neighbours, vnder the Conduct of King <hi>Comontoire,</hi>
they were in great danger. You must vnderstand that the <hi>Gaules</hi> which
had made Warre vnder the leading of <hi>Brennus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Brennus</hi> Chiefe of the <hi>Gaules.</hi>
               </note> and had escaped a great
danger at <hi>Delphos,</hi> past not into <hi>Asia</hi> when as they came to <hi>Hellesponte:</hi>
But allured with the commodity of the place, they staied neere vnto
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> whereas after they vanquished the <hi>Thracians,</hi> and built
<hi>Tyle</hi> the Royall,<note place="margin">The <hi>Thracians</hi> vanquished by the <hi>Gaules.</hi>
               </note> they made Warre against them of <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
Who at the beginning pacified their fury with presents, when as they
first assailed them vnder King <hi>Comontoire,</hi> in giuing them sometimes
thirty thousand, another time fifty thousand, and sometimes a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand Crownes, to the end they should not ouer-runne their
Country.<note place="margin">An absolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feate of the <hi>

Empire had an end, and this Nation was wholly vanquished and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct
by the <hi>Thracians.</hi> Their Treasure being at that time exhausted
by reason of these Tributes, they sent first an Embassie into <hi>Greece</hi> to
demaund their assistance. But for that most of the <hi>Greecians</hi> made no
account of it, they resolued to take a Tole vpon all these which should
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:16537:108"/>
passe into the Blacke Sea.<note place="margin">A Tole impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vpon those that failed into the Blacke Sea by <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
               </note> The which all the rest disliking for the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelty
of the thing, they blamed the <hi>Rhodiens</hi> for suffering it, as being
then Lords of the Sea.</p>
            <p>This was the beginning and Fountaine of the Warre which wee
are now to describe. The <hi>Rhodiens</hi> mooued, aswell with their owne
losse as with that of their neighbours, hauing first called their Allies,
sent an Embassie to <hi>Constantinople</hi> to abollish the Tole. VVho per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
their Voyage according to their Charge, could not perswade
the Commons: For that <hi>Hecatondore</hi> and <hi>Olympiodore</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mecatondore &amp; Olympiodore.</note> (who had then
the Gouernment of the Common weale) opposed themselues: So as
they returned without effect. So one after they sent to declare VVarre
vnto them for the afore-said causes. Presently after the <hi>Rhodiens</hi> sent
Embassadours to <hi>Prusias,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prusias.</note> to perswade him to make Warre against the
<hi>Constantinopolitains:</hi> for they knew well hee was offended with them
for certaine causes. The <hi>Constantinopolitains</hi> in like manner solicited
<hi>Attalus</hi> and <hi>Acheus</hi> by many Embassies,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Attalus</hi> and <hi>Achens.</hi>
               </note> to succour them against the
<hi>Rhodiens.</hi> It is true that <hi>Attalus</hi> was at liberty, but hee was much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
with pouerty: for that <hi>Acheus</hi> had forced him to retire himselfe
within the liberties of his Fathers Empire. Finally <hi>Acheus,</hi> who tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
himselfe Lord of all the Countrey which lies on this side <hi>Tauris,</hi>
and publishing himselfe for King, promised succours vnto the <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinopolitains,</hi>
which gaue them occasion of great hope, and terrified
very much the <hi>Rhodiens</hi> and <hi>Prusias:</hi> For <hi>Acheus</hi> was allied vnto <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
who raigned in <hi>Syria,</hi> and had attained to this Principallity by
such or the like meanes.</p>
            <p>After the death of <hi>Seleucus</hi> father vnto <hi>Antichus,</hi> and that his
Sonne <hi>Seleucus</hi> the eldest of the brethren, had succeded in the Realme,<note place="margin">The meanes of <hi>Acheus</hi> raigne.</note>
               <hi>Acheus</hi> past the Mountaine of <hi>Tauris</hi> with him in regard of his kindred,
about two yeares before the time whereof wee now speake. For as
soone as <hi>Seleucus</hi> was King, and hearing that <hi>Attalus</hi> had taken the
whole Country which lies on this side Mount <hi>Tauris,</hi> considering that
hee must giue order to his Affaires, passeth the Mountaine with a great
Army: VVhere within few dayes after hee was slaine by <hi>Apaturin</hi> a
<hi>Gaule,</hi> and <hi>Nicanor. Acheus</hi> resoluing to reuenge the death of his kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
kills them presently. And then he gouernes the Army and all
other affaires with great VVisedome and Courage. For when as the
opportunity of the time, and the generall consent of all the Souldiers,
perswaded him to take the Crowne; yet hee would not doe it, but kept
the Realme for the younger Brother <hi>Antiochus:</hi> and gouerning all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
matters carefull, he resolued to subdue the whole Country which
is on this side <hi>Tauris.</hi> But when as all things had succeeded happily,
and that in the end he had left nothing but <hi>Pergamus</hi> to <hi>Attalus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acheus</hi> causeth himselfe to be called King.</note> hee
presently changed his minde, and caused himselfe to bee called their
King, being growne proud with the Victories which hee had obtained
contrary vnto his Hope. So as it fell out that his name was more
feared, by the Inhabitants on this side <hi>Tauris,</hi> then of any other King
or Prince.</p>
            <p>Wherat the <hi>Constantinopolitains</hi> being moued, they made no difficulty
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:16537:109"/>
to vnder-take a Warre against the <hi>Rhodiens</hi> and <hi>Prusias:</hi> Who accused
them, that when they had promised to set vp his Images, yet they
afterwards forgot it thorough negligence: And withall, hee was
much more incensed, for that they had done what possibly they
could to pacifie the Warre which was kindled betwixt <hi>Acheus</hi> and
<hi>Attalus:</hi> For that euery man knew that their peace was dangerous to
him for many Reasons. Finally, hee obiected against them, that
whereas they had sent an Embassie to <hi>Attalus,</hi> at the Games which
he had made in the honour of <hi>Minerua,</hi> they had not sent any one
vnto him when hee gaues thankes vnto the Gods. For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
(being incensed) hee willingly embraced the <hi>Rhodiens</hi> party a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> And therefore hee agreed with their
Embassadours that they should send foorth a very strong Fleete, to
assaile the <hi>Constantinopolitains</hi> by Sea, promising likewise to inuade
them by Land with no lesse forces then they should. This was the
the beginning, and the causes of the Warre which the <hi>Rhodiens</hi> made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Constantinopolitains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They also at the first entred into it with great Courage, hoping that
<hi>Acheus</hi> would succour them, according vnto his promise. They
had also called <hi>Thibete</hi> of <hi>Macedony,</hi> whom they opposed against
<hi>Prusias:</hi> to take from him the meanes to make VVarre against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
being much troubled for the defence of his owne. But <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi>

hee presently tooke <hi>Fanum,</hi>

opportunity of the place: to the end that no man might enter or goe
foorth of the Pontique Sea but by their fauour. Moreouer he put all
the Countrey of <hi>Asia</hi> (which the <hi>Constantinopolitains</hi> had long helde)
to fire and Sword. On the other side the <hi>Rhodiens</hi> hauing made sixe
shippes, and taken foure from their Allies, whereof they made <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phante</hi>
Commaunder, they sailed vnto <hi>Hellesponte</hi> with an Army of
ten saile of very strong Shippes. And hauing left nine neere vnto <hi>Seste,</hi>
for the defence of the entry into the Pontique Sea, the Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hauing a good VVinde sailed with the tenth vnto <hi>Constantinople</hi>
to view their Countenance: And whither at this first beginning of
the VVarre they would be better aduised. But finding them ill affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
hee retired vnto his whole Army with the which hee returned
to <hi>Rhodes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the meane time the <hi>Constantinopolitains</hi> sent Embassies, some vnto
<hi>Acheus,</hi> intreating him to hasten his Succours: Others into <hi>Macedony</hi>
to draw downe <hi>Thibete;</hi> for it seemed that the Realme of <hi>Bythinia</hi> did
as rightly belong to <hi>Thibete</hi> as to <hi>Prusias,</hi> for that hee was his Vncle.
The <hi>Rhodiens</hi> being aduertised of the obstinacy of the <hi>Constantinopoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>
vsed Wisedome and Policy: For when they vnderstood that
all their Hope was in <hi>Acheus,</hi> whose Father <hi>Ptolomy</hi> kept in Prison
at <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
               <note place="margin">An Embassie sent by the <hi>Rhodiens</hi> to <hi>Ptolomy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and to intreate him with great Affection, to deliuer vnto
them the father of <hi>Acheus:</hi> to the end that by this means they should

did not seeme very willing to deliuer <hi>Andromochus,</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

with <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and that <hi>Acheus</hi> hauing seazed vppon the

For <hi>Andromochus</hi> was Father vnto <hi>Acheus,</hi> and brother to <hi>Laodicea</hi>

them, to restore him vnto his Sonne if they thought good. The
<hi>Rhodiens</hi> by this meanes hauing done according to their owne desires,
and reconciling themselues vnto <hi>Acheus</hi> by some other meanes, they
did frustrate the <hi>Constantinopolitains</hi> of their principall hope. There
fell out also another accident which troubled them very much:<note place="margin">The Death of <hi>Thibete.</hi>
               </note> For
<hi>Thibete</hi> whom they had drawne out of <hi>Macedony</hi> (as we haue said) died
suddainly of sicknesse. For which accidents the <hi>Constantinopolitains</hi>

of all hope, and suffering all the iniuries of Warre, they
sought and inuented some honest meanes to be freed. And therefore
when as <hi>Canare</hi> King of the <hi>Gaules</hi> approached neere vnto the City,
labouring by all meanes to pacifie this Warre,<note place="margin">

referred themselues vnto him for all their Quarrells. Whereof the

Triremes, meaning (as they commonly say) to send them peace or
Warre.</p>
            <p>After the comming of this Embassie vnto <hi>Constantinople,</hi> there was
an Accord made with the <hi>Rhodiens;</hi>

not take Tole of any one that sail'd into the Pontique Sea. The
which if they performed, the <hi>Rhodiens</hi> and their Allies would make

vppon these Conditions:<note place="margin">An accord made with <hi>Prusias.</hi>
               </note> that <hi>Prusias</hi> and the <hi>Constantinopolitains</hi>

               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:16537:110"/>
This was the beginning and ending of the Warre of <hi>Prusias</hi> and the
<hi>Rhodiens</hi> against the <hi>Constantinopolitains.</hi> At that time the <hi>Gnosiens</hi>
sent an Embassie to the <hi>Rhodiens,</hi> to draw from them three or foure
well built Tritemes, with the which <hi>Polemocle</hi> had lately made
his Voyage, with three other stately Vessels of Warre, against those
which lately had Reuolted against them. The which being done,
when as the Army arriued at <hi>Candy,</hi> the <hi>Eleuterneins</hi> doubting that
some few daies before <hi>Polemocle</hi> had slaine <hi>Timarche</hi> their Burgesse to
please the <hi>Gnosiens,</hi> made Warre against the <hi>Rhodiens,</hi> after they had
made their complaine. A little before the <hi>Lyciens</hi> had so many seuerall
crosses.</p>
            <p>Finally all <hi>Candy</hi> was in Combustion.<note place="margin">Candy in a man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner reduced all vnder the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the <hi>Gnosiens</hi> and <hi>Gortiniens.</hi>

making Warre with one Councell and consent, reducing all the
Iland vnder their obedience, except the <hi>Lyciens</hi> Towne: For the
taking whereof they did their vtmost power and indeauours, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in the end to rare and ruine it quite: To the end it might serue for
an Example to other Cities, to terrfie them from a Reuolt: For that
it alone would not receiue them for their Lords. In the beginning
all they of <hi>Candy</hi> made Warre against the <hi>Lyciens,</hi> but they beganne
presently to fall into Discorde, vpon a very light cause: The which
happens often with that Nation. So as the <hi>Polyreneins,</hi> the <hi>Certeins,</hi>
the <hi>Lampeins,</hi> and moreouer the <hi>Noreins,</hi> and the <hi>Arcadians</hi> held
the <hi>Lyciens</hi> party, forsaking the alliance of the <hi>Gnosiens.</hi> The <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniens</hi>
were in diuers opinions: The most aged held the <hi>Gnosiens</hi> party:
and the young men that of the <hi>Lyciens.</hi> The <hi>Gnosiens</hi> seeing the will
of their Allies thus changed, and that the Affaires went otherwise
then they formerly expected, they drew a thousand men from <hi>Etolia</hi>
by the right of Alliance. Which being done, the most aged of the
<hi>Gortiniens</hi> seazed suddainly vpon the Fort, drawing in the <hi>Gnosiens</hi> and
<hi>Etoliens,</hi> and deliuered them the Towne, chasing away the party of
the young men, and killing some most cruelty.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lyciens</hi> had by chance at that time made a Roade into the
Enemies Country, leauing no forces within the Towne, whereof
the <hi>Gnotiens</hi> being aduertised by their Spies, they tooke it vnfurnished
of any forces,<note place="margin">The <hi>Lyciens</hi> Towne razed and burnt.</note> and sent the Women and Children to <hi>Gnoson.</hi> And
when they had burnt and razed it with fury, they retired. The <hi>Lyciens</hi>
returning, were so amazed when they saw all in fire and ruine, as no
man durst enter into the Towne. But going about it in troupes, they
lamented their Countrey and Fortune. From thence turning head,
they returned to the <hi>Lampeins,</hi> who receiued them louingly and with
great affection: Who being Fugitiues and strangers, were in one day
admitted Burgesses, and made Warre against the <hi>Gnosiens</hi> with the
Allies.</p>
            <p>Behold how <hi>Lycia</hi> a Collony of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and the most
auncient of <hi>Candy,</hi> was suddainly and miserably ruined. The <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reneins,

be in League with the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> and the <hi>Etoliens</hi> to be enemies to <hi>Philip</hi>
and the <hi>Acheins,</hi> sent an Embassie to the King and the <hi>Acheins,</hi> to make a
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:16537:110"/>
League with them, and to draw succours from them. Who receiued
them, and sent them foure hundred <hi>Sclauonians,</hi> vnder the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
of <hi>Plator,</hi> and about a hundred <hi>Phoceins,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

Aptereins,</hi> and diuers others being shut vp within their
Wals, to abandon the <hi>Gnosiens</hi> alliance, and to imbrace their party.
Which things being effected, the <hi>Polyreneins</hi> and their Allies sent fiue
hundred <hi>Candyots</hi> to <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Acheins.</hi> Not long before the <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siens</hi>
had sent a thousand to the <hi>Etoliens.</hi> Thus the Warre was manna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
for the loue one of another. The banished men among the <hi>Gorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niens</hi>
surprized the Port of the <hi>Pheastins</hi> and that of the <hi>Gortiniens,</hi>
from whence they made many sallies against them of the Towne. And
this was the estate of the affaires of <hi>Candy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the same time <hi>Methridates</hi> made Warre against the <hi>Synopenses,</hi>

made prouision of ten thousand Goate skinnes fill'd with Wine, of

thousand made with sinewes, a thousand Armes compleate, three
thousand pieces of gold coyned, foure Merchants ships, with Crosse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowes
and other Engines of battery in great number. The <hi>Synopenses</hi>
hauing receiued all this prouision, returned to <hi>Synope.</hi> They were
in great feare least that <hi>Methridates</hi> should besiege them both by Sea

that <hi>Methridates</hi> should besiege the Towne, not onely on that side
which ioynes to <hi>Asia,</hi> but likewise on the other, drawing his Army
to Land, they did carefully fortifie that part which is inuironed by
the Sea, leauing a good Guard there to keep the Enemy from landing:

Wherefore their number and force augmented continually, and the

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:16537:112"/>
of their Townes, they had leuied men, considering the negligence of
the Chiefe of the <hi>Acheins.</hi> But whereas they would not furnish mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
for the common affaires of the league, that is not excusable: For
as it was not fit to neglect their owne affaires, so it was a base and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull
thing to omit that which concernes the preseruation of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
league: seeing they wanted not Victuals according to the common
conuentions: and moreouer they had beene Authours of the league
with the <hi>Acheins.</hi> And this was the estate of the affaires of <hi>Morea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> had past <hi>Thessaly,</hi> Philips Army. and was in <hi>Epirus:</hi> whereas taking a
number of <hi>Epirotes,</hi> with the <hi>Macedonians</hi> he brought with him, and
three hundred Slingers out of <hi>Acheia,</hi> with a hundred <hi>Candiots</hi> which
had beene sent by the <hi>Messeniens,</hi> hee comes vnto the Countrey of the
<hi>Ambraciates:</hi> whereas if hee had entred presently into the heart of <hi>Eto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
the Warre might haue had an end. But for that hee was solicited
by the <hi>Epirotes</hi> to force <hi>Ambracia</hi> first, he gaue the <hi>Etoliens</hi> meanes to
resist, and prouide that which was necessary for their defence. But
the <hi>Epirotes</hi> preferring their priuate interest before the common profit
of the Allies, hauing a great desire to make <hi>Ambracia</hi> subiect, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
<hi>Philip</hi> to besiege it, and to take it before he past: For they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
that the Towne of <hi>Ambracia</hi> would bee very beneficiall vnto
vnto them, if they might take from the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> and that it would
easily fall into their hands. You must vnderstand that <hi>Ambracia</hi> is a
place strong by nature, well fortified with double walles, and so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed
with Moares and Marishes, as there is but one narrow passage

neere vnto the Temple with great charge: moreouer, he ruined what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
was erected there for ornament or for vse: Finally, he beate in
peeces all the Images of Kings. Thus <hi>Scope</hi> in the beginning and first
fury of the War, hauing not onely assaulted Men, but euen the Gods
themselues, returned into <hi>Etolia,</hi> not as a Church-robber, or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable
to the immortall Gods, but he was honoured as a man of merit,
and a good seruant to the Common-wealth: and withall he gaue great
hope to the <hi>Etoliens</hi> for the time to come. For they conceiued that by
this meanes no man durst presume to enter as an enemy into their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and contrariwise they might easily run and spoile not onely <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi>
as they had beene accustomed, but also <hi>Thessaly</hi> and <hi>Macedony.
Philip</hi> aduertised of these thing which had beene done in <hi>Macedony,</hi> and

Townes which were strong by scituation and fortification: demol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
all the Castles, whereof there were a great number in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
Then abating his fury, he gaue leaue vnto his men to run where
they pleased for their owne gaine. After which he led his Army full
of wealth towards the <hi>Eniades,</hi> and layed Siege to <hi>Peania,</hi> resoluing to
take it by assault:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Peania</hi> taken by assault.</note> The which he did after many attempts, for although
the Towne were not very bigge, hauing but a thousand paces in circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it:
yet it was not inferiour to the rest in the strength of Walles, Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Houses. He razed the Walles to the ground, and ruined the
Houses, commanding to carry away the Timber and Tiles to the <hi>Eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades</hi>
by Water.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Etoliens</hi> first began to fortifie the Fort of the <hi>Ceniades</hi> to defend
it, rampring the Walles, making of Ditches, and doing all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for the fortification of a Towne. But being aduertised of <hi>Philips</hi>
approach, they fled for feare. <hi>Philip</hi> taking this Towne without any
resistance, led his Army into <hi>Calydonia,</hi> to a certaine Towne which
was held very strong, called <hi>Claos,</hi> the which was well rampred with
Walles, and all manner of fortifications. <hi>Attalus</hi> had furnished the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toliens</hi>
with munition to defend it. But the <hi>Macedonians</hi> taking it by

            <p>Whilest that <hi>Philip</hi> was busie about this worke, hee receiued Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

doubting of his Voyage into <hi>Morea,</hi> made hafte to leuie men,
and to make preparations for Warre, to fall suddainly vpon <hi>Macedony.</hi>
After which newes resoluing to succour it speedily, hee sent backe the
<hi>Acheins</hi> Embassadours with this answere, that as soone as hee had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
order for his affaires of <hi>Macedony,</hi> hee would haue nothing in so
great recommendation, as to come to their aide with all his forces. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this hee returned speedily with his Army by those Countries where
hee had formerly past. And as he past the Gulfe of <hi>Ambracia,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
from <hi>Acarnania</hi> to <hi>Epirus, Demetrius</hi> of <hi>Phare</hi> (whom the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>

him with great courtesie) caused to saile to <hi>Corinthe,</hi> and from

he presently transported himselfe into <hi>Macedony,</hi> to the Towne of <hi>Pella.</hi>
But when the <hi>Dardanians</hi> were aduertised by some fugitiue <hi>Thracians</hi> of
the Kings comming, they presently dissolued their Army, being terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

            </p>
            <p>At the same time <hi>Panlus Emilius</hi> triumphed at <hi>Rome,</hi> after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
from <hi>Sclauonia. Hannibal</hi> after the taking of <hi>Sagont,</hi> had sent his

Booke. But we now make a briefe repetition, to refresh the memory:
to the end that (as we haue promised) all the actions may be present
to the eyes of the Readers. The first yeere of this Olympiade is past.
And when as the day of the Election which the <hi>Etoliens</hi> make, was

Who being seized of the Magistracy, he drew together a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Souldiers, and falling vpon the high Countrey of <hi>Epirus,</hi> hee
made a most cruell spoile: so as it seemed, hee did it rather to ruine the

finally, he demollished it.</p>
            <p>Behold how the <hi>Etoliens</hi> cannot obserue any meane either in peace
or warre, so as both in the one and the other they violate the common
conuersation of men, and in a manner the Law of Nature. When as
<hi>Dorimache</hi> had committed all these mischiefes and many greater, hee
returned into his Country. But whilest that Winter lasted, and that
euery man despaired of the comming of <hi>Philip</hi> by reason of the rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the time, and hardnesse of the Winter, the King taking
three thousand men with Bucklers, and two thousand with Targets,
with three hundred <hi>Candiots,</hi> and about foure hundred Horse, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from <hi>Larissa:</hi> and taking his way by <hi>Thessaly,</hi> he came to <hi>Negre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont:</hi>
and from thence passing by <hi>Beocia</hi> and <hi>Megara,</hi> in the midst of
<hi>December</hi> he ariued at <hi>Corinthe,</hi> making his voyage so secretly, as no
man of <hi>Morea</hi> discouered it: then keeping the Gates of <hi>Corinthe</hi> shut,
and setting Watches vpon the wayes, the day following hee sent to <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syon</hi>
for old <hi>Arate.</hi> He then aduertised the Chiefe of the <hi>Acheins</hi>
and Townes, of the time and place when they should be ready and in
order. These things thus ordered, he continued his voyage as he had
resolued, and seated his Campe neere to <hi>Dioscore,</hi> a Towne of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liasia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the same time <hi>Euripides</hi> parting from <hi>Psophis</hi> accompanied with
two Legions of <hi>Eliences,</hi> Pirats at Sea, and some voluntaries, so as all

It fell out the Night that <hi>Philip</hi> camped neere vnto <hi>Dioscore,</hi>
that <hi>Euripides</hi> passing further at the breake of day, entred into the

whose meanes knowing that the <hi>Macedonians</hi> were neere, hee drew

abandoned their Armes, and fled. There were about twelue hundred
taken aliue by the Enemy:<note place="margin">A defeate of the <hi>Etoliens.</hi>
               </note> the rest were slaine, some by the <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
like Sheepe, others falling downe the Rocks, so as there escaped
not a hundred. <hi>Philip</hi> continued his course, and sent the spoiles and
Prisoners to <hi>Corinthe.</hi> This seemed very strange to them of <hi>Morea,</hi> to
whom the newes of the Victory, and of <hi>Philips</hi> arriuall came at one
instant.</p>
            <p>When the King had past by <hi>Arcadia,</hi> hauing suffred much vpon
the way by Snow, and the difficulty of the Countrey, hee arriued at
mid-night at <hi>Caphies</hi> on the third day. Where after hee had refresh't
himselfe three daies,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Arate</hi> ioynes with <hi>Philip.</hi>
               </note> and that <hi>Arate</hi> the younger had ioyned with him
with his Troupes, so as the whole Army consisted of ten thousand
men, hee arriued at <hi>Psophis,</hi> passing by <hi>Cliteria,</hi> and made great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision
of Darts and Ladders taken out of the Townes where hee past.
<hi>Psophis</hi> is a very ancient Towne of the <hi>Arcadians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The scituation of <hi>Psophis.</hi>
               </note> scituated in the midst
of <hi>Morea,</hi> ioyning to <hi>Arcadia</hi> vpon the West, and neere to the Couu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
of the <hi>Eliences,</hi> who at that time had the gouernment. Where
<hi>Philip</hi> arriued the third day after his departure from <hi>Caphies,</hi> and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this Campe vpon the Mountaines which are opposite, from whence
he might discouer the Towne and Countrey round about without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
Where viewing the strength, he was for a time in suspence: for
towards the West there ran a swift Torrent along the walls: the which
for the most part of Winter, was not to be waded thorough, so as no
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:16537:114"/>
man enters that way. And vpon the East it hath the Riuer of <hi>Eriman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Riuer of <hi>Erimanthe,</hi>
               </note>
which is great and violent: Of which the Poets and Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
tell many tales. Moreouer, the Torrent (whereof we haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken)
defends and assures the third part towards the South. In regard
of the fourth which lookes towards the North, it hath aboue it a
Mountaine which is steepe and difficult, and serues them for a good
Fort. By this meanes the Towne is defended on three sides by water,
and on the fourth by the Mountaine: And moreouer it is enuironed with
good walls, made with great Art. Finally, there was a Garrison of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enses,</hi>
with that which <hi>Euripides</hi> had brought with him in his flight.</p>
            <p>All these things considered, <hi>Philip</hi> was partly distasted to force it, for
the difficulty thereof. And partly inflamed to besiege it, for the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of the place. For hee considered that as this Towne was an
anoyance to the <hi>Acheins</hi> and <hi>Arcadians</hi> (for that it was an assured
Fort and safe retreate for Warre to the <hi>Elienses</hi>) so if it might bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
it would bee to them of great consequence, and a retreate to the
<hi>Arcadians</hi> for the Warre. Wherefore in the end following this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
hee sent vnto the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> that they should bee ready the
next day in the morning, and in Armes after they had fed. Then pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Bridge of <hi>Erimanthe</hi> without any opposition, considering
the strangenesse and greatnesse of the accident, hee came boldly, and
log'd at the foote of the Wall. Whereat <hi>Euripides</hi> and the Chiefe
of the Towne were in great doubt what to doe: for they immagined
that the <hi>Macedonians</hi> had no conceite to bee able to force this strong
Towne, and that they should not bee able to continue the Siege long
during that season. Wherefore when as they saw no likelyhood of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Treason within the Towne, the greatest part run to the walles to
defend them.</p>
            <p>The Voluntaries of the <hi>Elienses</hi> made a sally vpon the Enemy by the
Gate which lookes directly to the Campe.<note place="margin">A sally of the <hi>Elienses</hi> vpon the <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
               </note> But when as <hi>Philip</hi> had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
men to set vp Ladders in three places, and a sufficient number
of <hi>Macedonians</hi> for either of them, hee gaue warning for the assault.
Which done, they all fell to fighting with wonderfull fury. The besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the beginning defended themselues valiantly, and ouerthrew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
which laboured to scale the walls. But when as their Darts and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
munition failed them, as to men which had run hastily to the walls:
and withall the <hi>Macedonians</hi> retired not, but after the fall of one the next
ascended the Ladder, in the end they fled, and retired to the Fort. Then
the <hi>Macedonians</hi> of the Kings Troupe recouered the wall. On the other
side the <hi>Candiots</hi> who fought with those which made their sally from
the vpper part of the Towne, forced them in the end to flie, abandoning
their Armes basely: And pursuing them with great fury, they slew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
vpon the way, and entred the Towne with them: so as it was taken
in diuers places at one instant. All the Burgesses retired into the Fort
with their Wiues and Children.<note place="margin">

rest which had escaped the danger. The <hi>Macedonians</hi> being entred,
they spoyled both publique and priuate houses, and afterwards kept
themselues quiet within the Towne. They which held the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:16537:115"/>
Fort, being without victuals and other munition, they began to
thinke of yeelding, fore-seeing the future. Whereupon they sent a
trumpet to the King: and hauing obtained a passe-port for an Embassie,
they sent the Princes of the Towne with <hi>Euripides</hi> to <hi>Philip,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
with the King,<note place="margin">A composition made betweene the Citizens of <hi>Psophis</hi> and <hi>Philip.</hi>
               </note> that in yeelding him the place, the Burgesses
and strangers might retire in safety. This done, they returned againe
to the Fort according to the Kings command, not to depart before hee
had retired his Army out of the Towne, lest falling into the Souldiers
hands, they might bee spoiled. The King stayed some dayes there by
reason of the roughnesse of the weather: during the which hee calls to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
the <hi>Acheins</hi> which were in the Army, and made a long speech vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them of the scituation of the Town, and of its opportunity for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

gaue them the Towne, to the end they should know plainely, that hee
was resolued to please them in all things, and not to forget the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and diligence which was requisite in their affaires.</p>
            <p>After which Speech, when as the <hi>Acheins</hi> had giuen him thanks for
his loue and good-will,<note place="margin">

leauing the Fort, came into the Towne, and euery man returned to
his house. <hi>Euripides</hi> retired with his men first to <hi>Corinthe,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
into <hi>Etolia.</hi> The Chiefe of the <hi>Acheins</hi> which were there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
gaue the guard of the Fort to <hi>Proslae</hi> a <hi>Sycionian</hi> with a sufficient
Garrison, and made <hi>Pythias Pellenense</hi> Gouernour of the Towne. And
this was the end of the <hi>Psophiens</hi> Warre.</p>
            <p>When the Garrison of <hi>Lassion</hi> which consisted of <hi>Elienses,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               </note> they abandoned the Towne, as amazed at so strange

at <hi>Olympia:</hi> where after he had sacrificed to the Gods, and made
a solemne Banquet to all the Captaines, and refresht his men for the
space of three dayes, hee marcht, and entring the Countrey of the
<hi>Elienses,</hi> hee abandoned it to his Souldiers: Then planting his Campe
neere to <hi>Artimisea,</hi> hee returned soone after to <hi>Dioscoria,</hi> bringing a
great Booty from thence. Then making many Roads into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
there were a great number of men taken. Many also retired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the neighbour Townes, and into places of strength: For the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the <hi>Elienses</hi> is very fertile amongst the rest of <hi>Morea,</hi> in peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and abundance of wealth: for that the greatest part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
people are giuen to tillage, imploying their time in labour, vnto
the second and third generation: And alhtough they bee otherwise
rich, yet they enter not into Townes. The which happens, for
that the principall of the Townes haue the Labourers in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
and are very carefull that they may not be oppressed with
the want of any thing of that which is requisite and necessary for them,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:16537:115"/>
and that no man should do them wrong. In my opinion the ancients
haue so ordained it, for that in old time the multitude was commonly
giuen to tillage; or rather for that they led a holly and religious life, when
as with the consent of all the <hi>Grecians,</hi> they liued in safety, free from
all inconueniences and trouble of Warre, for the Combate which was
made at the Olympicke Games. But when by the controuersie of the
<hi>Arcadians,</hi> concerning <hi>Lassion</hi> and <hi>Pisa,</hi> they were forced to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
War for the defence of their Countrey, and to leaue their first man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of liuing, they cared no more to resume that ancient and heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
liberty giuen them by the <hi>Grecians,</hi> remaining in the same estate,
and making a bad discourse of the time to come. For if any may haue
from the <hi>Grecians</hi> (in obseruing right and iustice) peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
for euer, which is a thing which wee all demand of the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
Gods, and for the which wee endure any thing, and which all the
world confesseth to bee an vndoubted good, and yet they contemne it,
and doe not esteeme it, or hold some other thing in greater recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
are not they to be held fooles and mad men? But some one
will say vnto mee, that they which shall hold this course of life, shall
not be able to defend themselues, when they shall be opprest with War,
or some other outrage. This without doubt happens seldome, and if it
doth, they may be defended and relieued by all the <hi>Grecians.</hi> And if it
be a particular offence it will be no difficult thing to leuie men with the
money which they haue gathered together by long peac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and rest. But
now fearing that which happens seldome, and beyond all humane
consideration, they consume themselues and their Countrey in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
Warre and troubles Wee haue thought good to relate these
things of the <hi>Elienses;</hi> for there was neuer time, when as a greater oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
was offred, to recouer this liberty from all the <hi>Grecians,</hi> then at
this day. The people then as wee haue said, dwelt in all assurance.
Wherefore there were taken by the <hi>Macedonians</hi> a great number of
men, although that many were retired in strong places. For there was
assembled a great multitude of men and Cattell, with other wealth in
a neere Burrough, which they call <hi>Thalame:</hi> for that the Countrey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it is very streight, the approach is difficult, and the Burrough very
steepy, and in a manner inaccessible.<note place="margin">Thalame.</note> 
               <hi>Philip</hi> aduertised of this great as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
and being loath to leaue any thing which hee would not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
recouers the places of aduantage, to enter it with his Mercenaries:
and marcheth in person by the streights of the Countrey with the men
which bare Targets, and were lightly armed, leauing the Baggage, and
the greatest part of his Army in the Campe, and came vnto the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
finding no resistance.</p>
            <p>They which were therein, amazed at the greatnesse of this accident<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and ill furnished for the war, and without experience: hauing moreouer
many vnprofitable persons for their age, yeelded presently: Among the
which were two hundred Souldiers of diuers nations,<note place="margin">Thalame <hi>yeelds.</hi>
               </note> whereof <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus</hi>
Chiefe of the <hi>Elienses</hi> had the charge. <hi>Philip</hi> hauing made booty
of all things, as of fiue thousand men, and of an infinite number of
Cattell, returned presently to the Campe. And when as afterwards
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:16537:116"/>
the Souldiers seemed vnprofitable vnto him for the Warre, being thus
laden with spoiles, he raised his Campe and returned to <hi>Olympia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Appelles</hi> was one of the Tutors which was left to <hi>Philip</hi> in his infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
by <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and had then great authority and fauour with the
King.<note place="margin">Appelles <hi>Tutor to</hi> Philip.</note> Who beginning to practise with himselfe, by what meanes hee
might reduce the Nation of the <hi>Acheins,</hi> to the same estate wherein the
<hi>Thessalians</hi> were, he bethought himselfe of a notable villany. You
must vnderstand that the <hi>Thessalians</hi> seemed to liue vnder their owne
Lawes, and to differ much from the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> onely they endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
all things like vnto them, and obeyed the will of the King. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Appelles</hi> tending hereunto, began to try the hearts of those that
were in the Campe. And at the first hee commanded the <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The malicious policy of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles</hi>
               </note>
that if by chance the <hi>Acheins</hi> should take any place before them,
they should alwayes chase them away, and strip them of their Booty.
Afterwards he caused some to be whipt by the hangman for small offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
And if any one questioned this kind of outrage, or did succour them
that were beaten, they were put in prison, hoping by this meanes to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custome
the <hi>Acheins</hi> to endure patiently what should please the King.
Finally, when as some young men <hi>Acheins</hi> were assembled and come to
<hi>Arate,</hi> relating vnto him the practise of <hi>Appelles. Arate</hi> considering that
this must be preuented in the beginning, he came to <hi>Philip,</hi> and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with these young men, deliuered all things in order. Who being
heard, <hi>Philip</hi> wisht him to take no further care, and that hereafter they
should not be so intreated. He giues charge to <hi>Appelles</hi> not to decree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things against the <hi>Acheins</hi> without the aduice of their Commander.
<hi>Philip</hi> was held excellent in Eloquence and sweetnes of speech to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
his Souldiers,<note place="margin">The Nature of Philip.</note> and of great wisedome and courage in the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Armes, not onely in the iudgement of Souldiers, but of all <hi>Morea:</hi>
neither was it easie to finde a King which had so many gifts of Nature.
He was a man of great diligence, memory, and of a good aspect, and held
him worthy of an Empire, in whom there was a royall power, a great
force, and an incredible courage in actions of Warre, and as he layd the
foundation of his Empire by so many great virtues, it is hard to say for
what reason he was in the end so peruerted, and made an execrable and
wicked Tyrant of a good and iust King. Wherefore leauing this to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
season, we will returne to our discourse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philip</hi> parting from <hi>Olympia</hi> with his Army, came first to <hi>Pharia,</hi>
then to <hi>Erea,</hi> where the Booty was sold, whereof wee haue spoken.
Hee made a Bridge vpon <hi>Alphia,</hi> meaning to passe from thence into

time <hi>Philip</hi> hauing with him the choice of all the Troupes, was come

assailed the Towne of all sides, and scaled it, <hi>Philip</hi> commanded to doe

he studied first how to preuent it. When as by chance all the Magistrates

they had committed. Beleeue me, there is not any man but will say
that they had well deserued to be punished by him, and for the cause
for which they suffered. As soone as <hi>Chylon</hi> had done this Execution,
he transports himselfe to <hi>Lycurgus</hi> house: And although he were there,
yet he could not come at him; for hee was preserued by his Houshold
Seruants and by his neighbours, and retired vnto <hi>Pellene</hi> by vnknowne

and transporting himselfe to the place, he seazed vpon all his enemies,
and gaue courage to his friends, labouring to induce the rest to reuolt.
But when as he saw no man to like of it, and that the Citty was in
mutiny against him, fearing what might happen, steales away from
thence, and comes into <hi>Acheia</hi> alone, being chased out of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.

            <p>It is certaine that whilest the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> maintained their good

Moreouer the time of the Election approaching, hee had an intent to

well of the businesse, when they speake any thing against his Allies
and Friends, before hee giue credite to a slander. This is proper for
a King, and very profitable in all things. And therefore in this slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

Truth, before it be reuealed to the Assembly of the <hi>Acheins.</hi> This
answere was pleasing vnto the King, saying, That he would diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>But within few dayes after, when as <hi>Appelles</hi> could not finde any
proofe of those things which hee had obiected, there was by chance

at <hi>Dyme</hi> to diuide the Spoile, he went speedily vnto him. As soone
as <hi>Arate</hi> had newes of the banishment of <hi>Amphidamus</hi> from his owne

committed any thing against the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and goes vnto the

take away all occasions of Ambition and Discord, which might rise

To the end hee might supply their places in Person, or by his Creatures.

But now hee suffers the paine of his folly and Couetousnesse: For

sent <hi>Titus Sempronius</hi> with an Army into <hi>Affricke,</hi> and <hi>Publius Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
into <hi>Spaine. Antiochus</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> hauing no more hope to decide
their Controuersie concerning <hi>Syria,</hi> neither by Embassies nor mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
had begunne the Warre. And then King <hi>Philip</hi> prest with
want of Victuals and money for his Army, caused the <hi>Acheins</hi> to
assemble by their Magistrates. But when as the people were met at
<hi>Egia,</hi> according to the custome of the Countrey, the King seeing
<hi>Arate</hi> much discontented for the affront which hee had receiued from
<hi>Appelles,</hi> at the time of the Election, and that <hi>Eperate</hi> was disdained
of them all, as a man simple by Nature and sloathfull, and was helde
as a scorne, knowing also the treachery of <hi>Appelles</hi> and <hi>Leonce,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
againe to turne his affection to <hi>Arate.</hi> And after that hee had
perswaded the Magistrates to referre their Diet to <hi>Sicyon,</hi> hee spake cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously
to olde and young <hi>Arate,</hi> and perswaded them to continue in
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:16537:120"/>
their first affection, charging <hi>Appelles</hi> with all that had beene done.
Whereunto they consenting, hee presently after his entry into the
Assembly, obtained by their fauour was necessary for his
present affaires: for it was ordred by the <hi>Acheins</hi> that they should pay
vnto the King thirty thousand Crownes:<note place="margin">Mony &amp; Corne deliuered to <hi>Philip</hi> by the <hi>Acheins.</hi>
               </note> That is to say, three moneths

should haue sixe thousand two hundred Crownes monethly. Which
being done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Acheins</hi> returned euery man to his Towne. But win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
being past, and the Troupes returned, the King thought it best to
assaile the enemy by Sea: for hee saw well that by this meanes hee
might enter their Countrey, and surprize them on either side, and that
they should not bee able to succour one another, aswell for the distance
that is betwixt them, and for the newnesse of the Warre by Sea, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
for that they should bee amazed at the suddaine descent of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
for at that time hee made Warre against the <hi>Etoliens, Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>

hinder the Kings enterprizes, when opportunity did serue; and that
for his part he would goe to <hi>Chalcis</hi> to stoppe the Victualls that should
come to the Kings Army. When he had plotted this, hee went pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
thither, to put it in practise against the King: wherein hee kept
his Promise, and forced him to ingage his plate and all the rest of his
mooueables.</p>

about two thousand foote of the choice of the <hi>Acheins,</hi> for the

And as a little before he had Written vnto the <hi>Messeniens, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
Acarnaniens</hi> and to <hi>Scerdilaide,</hi> to meete him in <hi>Cephalenia</hi>
with their Equipage by Sea, hee parts presently from <hi>Patres,</hi> and
sailes directly into <hi>Cephalenia</hi> to the Burrough of <hi>Prones.</hi> But when
he saw it difficult to besiege, and the Countrey streight, hee past on
with his whole Army, and came to <hi>Palea:</hi> Where seeing the Region
fertile in Corne, and in all other manner of munition, and fit to feede
his Army, he landed his men, and planted his Campe neere vnto the
Towne Wals. He also drew his shippes a shore, and inuironed them
with deepe Ditches and strong Pallisadoes, fitting for their defence.
Hee likewise sent the <hi>Macedonians</hi> to forrage, and himselfe went to
view the Towne: and resolued to set vp his Engines, and to make all
necessary preparations to force it, meaning to attend the succours of
friends and Allies, and to make the Towne subiect to his obedience:
As well to depriue the <hi>Elienses</hi> of the greatest benefite and commodity
they had by Sea (for without doubt they sailed into <hi>Morea</hi> by night,
with the <hi>Cephalenian</hi> shippes, and spoiled the Sea Coasts of the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotes</hi>
and <hi>Acarnaniens</hi>) as also to prepare this Towne for his Allies,

               </note> it lyes within the shore of
the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Gulfe, looking towards the Sea of <hi>Sycily,</hi> and bends
towards the parts of <hi>Morea,</hi> which turne towards the North and
West, and likewise towards the Prouince of the <hi>Elienses,</hi> and the parts
of <hi>Epirus, Etolia,</hi> and <hi>Acarnania,</hi> which haue their aspect towards
the South and East. VVherefore he resolued to do what possibly hee
might, to Conquer this Iland, for the place was very conuenient to
assemble the Allies, and well seated to offend the enemies Townes,
and for the defence of those of the League. And when hee saw that
all the Quarters of the Towne were inuironed, partly with the Sea,
and partly with steepy Rockes, and that there was onely a little plaine
which lookes towards <hi>Zacinthe,</hi> hee was fully resolued to plant
his Battery there, and to prepare and make all things necessary for
the siege.</p>
            <p>In the meane time there arriued fifteene shippes of VVarre sent by
<hi>Scerdilaide,</hi> saying, that for the present hee could not furnish and
make ready any more, by reason of some mutinies and dissentions
which had lately happened in <hi>Sclauonia.</hi> There also arriued succours
and supplies from the <hi>Epirotes, Acarnaniens,</hi> and <hi>Messeniens,</hi> as he
had ordained: For the <hi>Messeniens</hi> maintained the rest of the VVarre
freely, after the taking of the Citty of <hi>Phigalee.</hi> VVhen as the King
had prepared and made things necessary for the siege, and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
of Battery were appointed in conuenient places, hee approaches
them to the Towne incouraging and giuing heart to his men: By whose
meanes after they had mined, they presently opened a Quarter of the
VVall, the which was vnderpropt with great peeces of Timber, so
great is the experience &amp; knowledge of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> in such affaires.
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:16537:121"/>
Then <hi>Philip</hi> approaching neerer vnto the Wall, hee beganne to sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
the besieged to yeilde. But vpon their refusall, they suddainely
set fire on that part of the Wall, and ouer-threw it. This beeing
done hee sent the Souldiers which carried Targets to make the point,<note place="margin">

being vnder the Charge of <hi>Leonce,</hi> commanding them to assaile it and
enter that way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leonce</hi> remembring his Conspiracy, and finding an opportunity to
put it in execution, perswaded three young men of his followers,
which marcht before all his Troupes to the assault of the Towne, that
they should hinder the taking thereof, winning the Captaines of their
acquaintance, and Charging very faintly as if they were affraide. By
this meanes they were shamefully repuls'd and beaten off from the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
hauing many Wounded and soare hurt: Although they might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
haue had the Victory, and haue come off with a great deale of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
The King seeing the feare of the Captaines, and the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
that were Wounded, raised the siege. And from that time hee
assembled his Friends and Allies, holding a Councell of that which
hee had to doe for the future.</p>
            <p>In the meane time <hi>Lycurgus</hi> entred into <hi>Messenia</hi> with an Army:
And <hi>Dorimache</hi> with halfe the <hi>Et<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <note place="margin">Embassadours sent to <hi>Philip</hi> from the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seniens</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnaniens.</hi>
               </note> Wherefore
Embassadours come vnto the King from the <hi>Acarnaniens</hi> and <hi>Messeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens.</hi>
He of the <hi>Acarnaniens</hi> intreated him to make a Descent into the
<hi>Etoliens</hi> Country, to the end hee might draw <hi>Dorimache</hi> from his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize,
and that he would spoile and consume all the Enemies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
He of the <hi>Messeniens</hi> demaunded Succours, shewing that it
was but a dayes iourney from <hi>Cephalenia</hi> vnto <hi>Messena,</hi> a Northerly
Winde blowing: And therefore <hi>Gorgon</hi> sayd that the Voyage would
be suddaine and of great profite and gaine. <hi>Leonce</hi> remembring his
Conspiracy, helde for <hi>Gorgon,</hi> seeing plainely that by this meanes,
<hi>Philip</hi> should spend all the Spring in doing nothing: For the Voyage
from thence to <hi>Messena</hi> was easie, but the returne impossible; for the
Winds blew still Northerly.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it was apparent that if <hi>Philip</hi> past with his Army thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
hee should consume the rest of the Spring idlely, and in the
meane time the <hi>Etoliens</hi> ouer-running <hi>Thessaly</hi> and <hi>Epirus,</hi> would put
all to fire and Sword. This was the reason why hee Councelled this
and such like things. But <hi>Arate</hi> was of a contrary minde and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
For hee was of aduice that they should sayle into <hi>Etolia,</hi> and to
make Warre first there: For hee immagined that the time was very
fitting and conuenient to spoyle and ruine the Prouince, for that the
<hi>Etoliens</hi> were gone to the Warre with <hi>Dorimache.</hi> The King fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
no more the Councell of <hi>Leonce</hi> in any thing, both for that
the affaires succeeded ill in the last siege, as for that hee was resolued
to imbrace that of <hi>Arate,</hi> considering the long experience and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
he had of his Wisedome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wherefore hee wrote vnto <hi>Eperate</hi>
Chiefe of the <hi>Acheins</hi> that in holding the Legions suddainely ready,
hee should succour and ayde the <hi>Messeniens.</hi> And in the meane time he
parts from <hi>Cephalenia,</hi> and two dayes after arriues in the middle of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:16537:121"/>
the night with his Army by Sea at <hi>Leucade:</hi> And from thence holding
his course a long the Sea of <hi>Ambracia,</hi> the which as wee haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
sayd, parting from that of <hi>Sycily,</hi> extends it selfe into <hi>Etolia.</hi>
And when hee was come vnto the Marshes, hee stayed there a little
before day, and cause<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h his men to feede and refresh their weary bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
commanding them to be ready without any Baggage. Then he
called his guides and inquires of the places and Townes, and of all
things else that were necessary.</p>
            <p>At the same time <hi>Aristophantes</hi> arriued with a good Troupe of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnaniens,</hi>
hauing a great desire to reuenge the great and many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages,
which the <hi>Etoliens</hi> had done them in former times. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
receiuing the <hi>Macedonians</hi> willingly, they drewe to Armes, not
they onely which were bound by the Law, but euen many olde men.
The <hi>Epirotes</hi> had no lesse desire to doe the like for many reasons: But
they could not assemble in time for the great extent of the Prouince,
and the suddaine comming of <hi>Philip, Dorimache,</hi> as wee haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
sayd, had halfe the <hi>Etoliens</hi> with him, and left the rest in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
parts of the Countrey to be ready, if any new accident should
happen.</p>
            <p>The King parting after noone from the Fenns, and hauing left suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
force to guard the Baggage, when hee had marcht about three

               </gap>ted his Campe. Where after hee had stayed
some certaine space, and had caused his Souldiers to feede, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
themselues being formerly wearied, he continued his course: So
as marching all night,<note place="margin">The Riuer of <hi>Acheloe.</hi>
               </note> he arriued before day at the Riuer of <hi>Acheloe,</hi>
betwixt <hi>Conope</hi> and <hi>Strate,</hi> seeking to surprize <hi>Ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e</hi> by a way which
they did not regard. <hi>Leonce</hi> and <hi>Megalee</hi> fore-saw for two reasons that
the King would preuaile in his enterprize, and that the <hi>Etoliens</hi> would
haue the worst. The one was, that the <hi>Macedonians</hi> descent was sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine,
and much more speedy then they could immagiue: The other,
that the <hi>Etoliens</hi> fearing not that <hi>Philip</hi> passing by those rough and
difficult Countries, would be vnprouided. Wherefore considering
these things, and mindfull of their Conspiracy, they aduised <hi>Philip</hi>
that in seating of his Campe neere to the Riuer of <hi>Acheloe,</hi> he should
refresh his Army for the last nights labour: Hoping that by this meanes
the <hi>Etoliens</hi> should haue time to seeke for succours, from their friends
and Allies.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Arate</hi> holding the time very precious to effect the Kings Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
and that <hi>Leonce</hi> and <hi>Megalee</hi> like Traytors sought how to stop
and preuent his passage, hee intreates <hi>Philip</hi> not to loose so faire an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.
Following whose aduise, the King beginning to bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
with <hi>Leonce</hi> and <hi>Megalee,</hi> hee proceeded in his iourney:
And passing the Riuer of <hi>Acheloe</hi> hee marcht directly vnto <hi>Therme</hi> with
his whole Army, putting all to fire and Sword: On the left hand hee,
left the Townes of <hi>Strate, Agrinia,</hi> and <hi>Testia:</hi> And vppon the right
hand he left <hi>Conope, Lysimachia, Tryconia,</hi> and <hi>Philea.</hi> Beeing come
to the Towne of <hi>Methape,</hi> which lyes betwixt <hi>Tryconia</hi> and the Fenns,
about threescore furlongs distant from <hi>Therme,</hi> the <hi>Etoliens</hi> fled.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:16537:122"/>
Wherefore hee tooke it, and put into it a Garrison of fiue hundred
men,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Methape</hi> taken by <hi>Philip.</hi>
               </note> to the end he might make vse of it for a Retreate, aswell in his
passage as in his returne by those streights: For the Countrey especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
about the Fennes is Mountainous, difficult, and inuironed with
thicke Forrests.</p>
            <p>By this meanes the way is very troublesome, and in a manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible.
Then he put the Voluntaries in the foreward, and after
them the <hi>Sclanonians:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The order which <hi>Philip</hi> held to passe the streights of <hi>Therme.</hi>
               </note> Then followed the Targeteers and the Legina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and in this manner hee marcht thorough the streights, hauing
the <hi>Candy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </hi> in the Reare, and the <hi>Thraciens</hi> on the right Wing for
a support. In regard of the left side, the Fennes did fortifie them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
thirty Furlongs in length or rather more. When hee had speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
past the streights, and taken the Burrough of <hi>Pamphia,</hi> and had
put a Garrison into it, he proceeded towards <hi>Therme,</hi> which is not
onely difficult and inaccessible, but hath also deep Vallies round about
it: so as in some places the way is dangerous and narrow, with an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
about thirty furlongs high. The which hauing soone past, for
that the <hi>Macedonians</hi> had carried themselues like braue men,<note place="margin">

               </note> hee
came in the dead of the night vnto <hi>Therme,</hi> a very rich and likewise a

thought not to offend. Calling to minde the outrages which <hi>Scope</hi> and

they would vndoubtedly haue condemned themselues for their faultes,
in commending and approouing <hi>Philip</hi> with great admiration, for that

in the one the Souldiers attribute vnto themselues the greatest part
of the glory, which is a great matter: But in curtesie, gentlenesse, and

considering his age, they will not attribute to <hi>Philip</hi> the greatest part of
those things which he had done, but to those that were in the Warre
with him, of which number were <hi>Arate</hi> and <hi>Demetrius</hi> of <hi>Phare.</hi> The
which would be easie to say vnto him, although he had not beene there
present, aud that this outrage done vnto the Gods, had beene by the
aduice of one of them. It is true, that this was done contrary to the

put in practise, for that the <hi>Etoliens</hi> hauing drawne together three

Then continuing his way for three dayes together, hee wasted the

lodged within a Bowes shoote of the Towne, drawing the Inhabitants
often to skirmish. For he had beene aduertised, that there were three

being vanquished, fled of all sides. Those which the King had sent,
pursued the greatest part of them to the Gates and walls of the Towne,
whereof there were a hundred slaine in the chase: the rest durst no

without danger to their ships.</p>
            <p>After which <hi>Philip</hi> planted his Campe, and gaue thankes vnto the

And making a Banquet, he inuited all the Captaines. It seemed
true, that he had past by dangerous places, into the which no man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

thousand Foote and two hundred Horse. But the length of the way
was the cause they came not to <hi>Tegee</hi> before the Kings departure. And
therefore doubting in the beginning what they should doe, fearing
likewise that it would seeme, they had willingly made this delay for the
suspition they had of them in the beginning, they resolued to enter the

speedily make sallies by diuers places, taking their way towards <hi>Eurota,</hi>
which is a Riuer neere vnto the Citty. These were the actions of <hi>Lieur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
and the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> at that time.</p>
            <p>But to the end that what wee say, may not seeme obscure by the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of places, wee must declare the nature and scituation: The
which we will indeauour to doe throughout our whole worke, alwaies
ioyning places knowne to the vnknowne: For the difference of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes
doe many times deceiue in Warre, as well by Sea as Land. Our
desire is, that all men should know not onely the things, but how they
were done. And therefore the description of places is necessary in all
things, but especially in Warre: neither may we blame the vse of Fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s,
Seas, and Ilands for signes: and sometimes of Temples, Mountaines,
Townes, and certaine Countries: nor finally the difference of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances:
For these are things common to all men. It is also the meanes
to aduertise the Reader of things vnknowne, as we haue sayd. The sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
of places whereof we speake is this. Although that <hi>Lacedemon</hi>
seemes to stand in a plaine, yet it hath here and there rough and hilly
places: Neere vnto which towards the East, passeth this Riuer which
they call <hi>Erota,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Riuer of <hi>Erota.</hi>
               </note> the which for the most part of the yeere is not to be
waded thorough, by reason of its great depth. The Mountaines where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>Menelaie</hi> stands, are on the other side of the Riuer towards the Citty,
which looke towards the Winters East: the which are tough and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
and wonderfull high: And bend ouer the Plaine which lies betwixt
the Riuer and the Citty, by the which it takes its course along the foote
of the Mountaines. The King was of necessity to passe that way, hauing
the Citty on the left hand, and the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ready and in Armes:
And on the right hand the Riuer, and those which were in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
with <hi>Licurgus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Matters standing in this estate, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> bethought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
of a stratagem, by the which in breaking of a Damme, they should
drowne all the Plaine betwixt the Citty and the foot of the Mountains,
so as neither Horse nor Foote should be able to passe. By this meanes
they saw the King should bee forced to lead his Army by the foote of
the Mountaines: the which he could not doe without great danger:
for that he should be forced to extend his Army in length, and not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
and close, and to march a slow pace. <hi>Philip</hi> seeing this, assembles
his Friends, and was of opinion, that he must first chase away <hi>Licurgus</hi>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:16537:126"/>
from the places which hee held. Wherefore he takes in his company
the Mercenaries, the Targeteers, and the <hi>Sclauonians,</hi> and began to
march directly towards the Mountaines to passe the Riuer. <hi>Licurgus</hi>
vnderstanding of the Kings resolution, put his men in Battaile, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades
them to doe their duties in fighting, and withall hee makes a
signe to them of the Citty, as he had promised. Which done, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
presently sally forth, putting the Horse-men on the right wing.
When <hi>Philip</hi> came neere vnto <hi>Licurgus,</hi> he sent the Mercenaries to giue
the first charge, of whom the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had the better at the first,
by reason of the aduantage of the place and the manner of their Armes.
But when as he had sent the Targeteers with the <hi>Sclauonians</hi> to succour
the Mercenaries, there was so great an alteration, as the Mercenaries
seemed to haue the victory in their hands:<note place="margin">The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>light of the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>
               </note> And the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
at the fury of them that were well armed, fled presently, as despai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of their safety. There died about a hundred men: and some few
more taken: the rest recouered the Citty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Licurgus</hi> taking his way by inaccessible woods, arriued the night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
at the Citty. When as <hi>Philip</hi> had put a sufficient strength of <hi>Scla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uonians</hi>
into the Mountaines, he returned with them that were lightly
armed, and the Targeteers to his Army. At the same time <hi>Arate</hi> bringing
back the Army from <hi>Amycle,</hi> was not far from the City<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with whom the
King (passing the Riuer) ioyned, and appointed them that were well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to make head against the Horse-men at the foot of the Mountaine.
When as the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Horse-men had charged the <hi>Macedonians,</hi>
and the targeteers had fought valiantly, and withal the King had perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
his duty well, they were in the end repuls'd shamefully to the gates
of the City. Afterwards the King past <hi>Eurota</hi> safely, and was forced to
settle his Campe in the night, at his comming forth of the streights, in a
place which was very strong by nature. Finally, the King had an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
to ouer-run the Countrey neere to <hi>Lacedemon.</hi> In the beginning
of the said streights vpon the approaches from <hi>Teges</hi> by the firme Land
to <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> there is a place about two Furlongs distant from the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
vnder the which the Riuer hath its course: the which imbraceth
the Citty and the side of the Riuer, with a steepe and inaccessible Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.
The foote of this Mountaine is a slimy and watery Plaine, as
well for the entry as the going forth of an Army: so as whosoeuer plants
his Campe there, in seazing vpon the Hill, seemes to campe safely, and
to be in a sure place, in regard of the Towne which is opposite, hauing
vnder its power the entry and issue of the streights. <hi>Philip</hi> hauing sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Campe there, he causeth the Baggage to march the next day,
and drawes his Army into the Plaine, in view of the Towne. Where
after he had stayed some time, hee wheeles about like a Bowe, and
takes his way towards <hi>Tegea.</hi> And when hee came into the Countrey
where that famous Battaile was fought betwixt <hi>Antigonus</hi> and <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
he planted his Campe there.</p>
            <p>Three dayes after when the places were well viewed, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
performed in two Mountaines, whereof the one is called <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe,</hi>
and the other <hi>Eua,</hi> he went on his way, and came to <hi>Tegea,</hi> where
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:16537:126"/>
he stayed some time to diuide the spoile: Then suddainly hee returned
to <hi>Corinthe</hi> with his Army. Thither came Embassadours from <hi>Rhodes</hi>
and <hi>Chios</hi> to the King,<note place="margin">Embassadours from <hi>Rhodes</hi> to <hi>Chios.</hi>
               </note> to mediate a peace betwixt him and the <hi>Etoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens.</hi>
To whom the King giuing a gracious reception, he told them that he
had long, and at that present was ready to imbrace a peace if the <hi>Etoliens</hi>
held it fit, and that they should goe vnto them, and consider of the
meanes therof. From thence he went to <hi>Leche,</hi> and prepared himselfe to
imbarke, desiring to decide some pressing affaires at <hi>Phocis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the same time <hi>Leonce, Megalee,</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> thinking yet to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
the King, and by that meanes to repaire their errours, calls the
Targeteers, and those whom the <hi>Macedonians</hi> terme, the Kings
Troupe: whom they informe that they are dayly in great danger with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any recompence, or any share in the spoile, according to the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
custome approued by all men. By meanes whereof they perswade
these young men to assaile and spoile the Lodgings of the Kings princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
Minions, and that falling vpon the Kings owne Lodging, they
should ouerthrow the Gates and couering. The which when they had
done,<note place="margin">A mutiny a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>philip</hi> and his men.</note> there grew a great mutiny in the Towne. <hi>Philip</hi> hearing the
noise, makes haste to returne from the Port: And drawing the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians</hi>
together, he pacifieth them partly with words, and blaming
them for the things which they had done. And when as the fury increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and that some were of opinion to chase out of the Towne those
that had beene the cause of the mutiny, others saying that this fury of
the Commons ought to bee pacified without any greater punishment,
the King dissembled his conceite for the present: And being as it were
perswaded by them, hee returned to the Hauen, after hee had giuen
them many admonitions, knowing well the heads of this villany: But
hee thought good to deferre it to a more conuenient time. <hi>Leonce</hi> and
his Faction despairing,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Leonce</hi> and his Faction retired to <hi>Appelles.</hi>
               </note> for that none of their enterprizes succeeded,
retired to <hi>Appelles,</hi> and caused him to come from <hi>Cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the King crost them in all things. <hi>Appalles</hi> had carried himselfe in <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi>
with greater liberty then was fit: for he gaue them to vnderstand that
the King was young, vnder his Guard and without any power, terming
himselfe Lord, and sole Gouernour of all things. Wherefore all the
Princes of <hi>Macedony</hi> and <hi>Thessaly</hi> adrest themselues to him in all affaires.
Within a short time likewise all the Citties of <hi>Gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

King in their elections, honours, and offices: Onely <hi>Appelles</hi> mannaged
all affaires. The King being long before aduertised thereof, was much
discontented and incensed: whereunto <hi>Arate</hi> spurd him on continually,
although he dissembled his conceite so well, as no man could discouer
it. <hi>Appelles</hi> ignorant of the Kings resolution, and thinking to obtaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing when he should present himselfe vnto him, came from <hi>Calcis</hi> to
<hi>Corinthe.</hi> When he came neere the Towne, <hi>Leonce, Ptolomy,</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galee</hi>
Chiefe of the Targeteers, and other Souldiers that were best ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
gaue him a great reception, perswading the youth to goe and meere
him. He came then to the Kings lodging in pompe, being attended on by
the Captaines and Souldiers. When as he sought (as he was wont) to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:16537:127"/>
enter suddainly, a certaine Vsher told him, that he must haue patience,
for that the King was busie for the present. <hi>Appelles</hi> wondring at this
new manner of proceeding, remained pensiue for a time, after which
he departed discontented, and without iudgement: all the rest likewise
abandoned him, so as hee returned alone to his lodging, hauing no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

which a little before were were giuen in Copper, are suddainly turned
into Gold, according to the will of those that dispose of them: So
they which follow the Courts of Princes, are according to the Kings
will and pleasure, happy one day, and miserable the next. When <hi>Megalee</hi>
knew that he had sought the assistance of <hi>Appelles</hi> in vaine, he trembled
for feare, and intended to flye. After that day <hi>Appelles</hi> was called to Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets

            <p>During the which, the Embassadours of <hi>Rhodes</hi> and <hi>Chios</hi> returned

by the which he solicits them to maintaine the Warre couragiously,
for that the King could not long continue it for want of victuals and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>Although the <hi>Etoliens</hi> desired peace, being discontented with the

Yet aduertised of the mutiny of the Targeteers, and of the death

Towne, and to the Mercenaries, and was not obeyed, nor made
any preparation for the defence of the Countrey, <hi>Pyrrhee</hi> (whom
the <hi>Etoliens</hi> had sent to the <hi>Elienses</hi> for their Captaine, accompanied
with thirteene hundred <hi>Etoliens,</hi> and a thousand Foote, as well Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
as Burgesses of the <hi>Elienses,</hi> and with two hundred Horse, being
in all about three thousand men) aduertised thereof, spoiled not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Countries of the <hi>Dimenses</hi> and <hi>Pharenses,</hi> but also of <hi>Patres:</hi>
Finally,<note place="margin">The Mountain <hi>Panachaique.</hi>
               </note> he pitched his Campe neere vnto the Mountaine <hi>Panachaique.</hi>

which lookes towards <hi>Patres,</hi> and wasted all the neighbour Region.
The Townes thus vexed, being no was succour'd, they payed the Taxe
and charge vnwillingly: The Souldiers would not be drawne to succour
them, for that their pay was delayed. By this mutuall trouble the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheins</hi>
affaires were in bad case: And the Mercenaries retired by little
and little: the which happened by the negligence of the Commander.

            <p>But seeing that in the distinction of times, and the order of actions,
we haue found a conuenient place for this Subiect, let vs passe to the

the end the Readers may not be deceiued in the true knowledge of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
time: I hope to leaue a sufficient instruction for those which desire to
know it, in setting downe at what time in this present Olympiade, and
of the deeds of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> the beginning and ending of other acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
happened: Moreouer, wee esteeme nothing better nor more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
in this Olympiade, then not to confound things, to the end
the discourse of the History may be plaine and easie: And that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
matters by order as much as may be possible, vntill that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to other Olympiades, wee may yeeld to euery yeere its actions
according to order. And for that we haue not resolued to write them
all, nor the actions of all places, and that wee haue vndertaken with
greater affection to write Histories then our predecessours haue done;
it is fitting wee should be carefull to expresse them in order, and that
the generall worke of the History may with its parts be plaine and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent.
Wherefore we will now write the Reignes of <hi>Anti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>chus</hi> and
<hi>Ptolomy,</hi> reducing things from farre, and pursuing our discourse from
a beginning which may bee notorious, and which squares with that
which wee haue to say.</p>
            <p>For those ancients which haue sayd, that the beginning is a
moiety of the whole, they haue vndoubtedly taught vs, that in all
things wee should vse great diligence,<note place="margin">An order re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in all things.</note> that the beginnings may be well
ordered. And although some thinke they haue vsed a high Stile, yet
in my opinion they doe not seeme to speake with truth. Without
doubt you may boldly say, that the beginning is not onely a moiety
of the whole, but hath also a regard to the end. Tell mee, how
canst thou make a good beginning, if thou hast not first comprehended
in thy vnderstanding the end of thy Enterprize? And if thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
not in what part, to what purpose, and the cause why thou wilt
make it? For how can a History haue order, if at the beginning or
entrance thou doest not deliuer plainely, from whence, and how,
or wherefore thou art come vnto the relation which thou doest
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:16537:128"/>
presently make of actions? Wherefore they which will haue
things heard and vnderstood fully, thinke that the beginnings doe not
onely serue for the one halfe, but also for the end: wherein they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
themselues with great care and industry: the which I will careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
indeauour to doe. Although that I am certaine that many of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Historiographers haue bin confident to haue done the like, when
as they pretended to write all generally, and to haue written a longer
History then their predecessours: of whom I will forbeare to speake
much, or to name them: Among the which I excuse <hi>Ephorus,</hi> the first
and onely man which hath attempted to write a generall History. But
I will vse no longer discourse, nor name any of the rest: But I will say
that some Historiographers of our time, comprehending the Warre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> in three or foure small Pages, brag
publiquely that they haue written all. It is certaine that for as much as
there hath beene many and great exploits performed in <hi>Spaine, Affricke,
Stoily</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and that the Warre of <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nnibal</hi> hath beene the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
and longest, except that of <hi>Sicily.</hi> We must also vnderstand, that
the excellency of this warre hath beene the cause that wee haue all cast
our eyes vpon it: and the rather for that wee were in doubt of the end.
This is a Warre which euery man (be hee neuer so dull and simple)
knowes. Yet some of those which haue handled the History, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
onely superficially the actions of some times, yet they imagine
they haue comprehended the deeds of the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
Whereof the cause is, for that it is an easie thing to promise many great
things by mouth, but it is not easie to bring a great enterprize to an
end. And therefore this other is common, and (as a man may say)
in the hands of all men, so as they haue courage: But the last is rare,
and few men attaine vnto it. Finally, the arrogancy of some, which
glorifie themselues too much, and commend their Writings, hath
caused mee to make this digression. But now I returne vnto my
enterprize.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> surnamed <hi>Philopater,</hi> had seized vpon the Empire of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> after the death of his Father,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ptolomy</hi> King of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </note> and had made away his Brother
with his adherents, (thinking there was no more cause of feare in his
Family, for the afore said crime:) and that for strangers, Fortune had
in good time assured all things, considering the death of <hi>Antigonus</hi>
and <hi>Seleucus:</hi> to whose Realmes <hi>Antiochus</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> had succeeded,
who were scarce eighteene yeeres old) he abandoned himselfe to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
whose example the whole Countrey followed. For this cause his
owne people made no esteeme of him. And not onely his subiects, but
also the rest which mannaged the affaires both within and without <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi>
The Lords of the lower <hi>Syrria,</hi> and of <hi>Cypres,</hi> haue made Warre
against the Kings of <hi>Syria,</hi> as well by Sea as Land. They also which hold
the chiefe Cities, places, and Ports which are along the Sea-coasts, from
<hi>Pamphilia</hi> vnto <hi>Hellespont,</hi> and the Country of <hi>Lysimachia,</hi> confined with
the Principalities of <hi>Asia</hi> and the Ilands. And as for <hi>Thracia</hi> and <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dony,</hi>
the Princes of <hi>Enos</hi> and <hi>Maronia,</hi> and of Townes that were
more remote, had alwayes an eye ouer them. Wherefore imploying
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:16537:129"/>
their forces, to assaile forreine Princes, farre from their Realmes,
they were not troubled for the Empire of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Their chiefe care
then was for the Warres of forreine Countries. In regard of this King
of whom wee speake, there were many in a short time, who for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
loues, and ordinary excesse in drinking, had an eye vpon him
and his Realme.<note place="margin">The enterprize of <hi>Cleomenes</hi> vpon <hi>Ptolomy.</hi>
               </note> Amongst the which <hi>Cleomenes</hi> of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> was the
first. He made no alteration whilest that the other King liued, who
was surnamed <hi>Benefactor:</hi> as if he were perswaded, that during his life
he should want no meanes to reconquer his Realme.</p>
            <p>But when as after his death, the affaires required his presence, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi>
being also dead: And that the <hi>Acheins</hi> with the <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
made Warre against the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> which they maintaine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
vnto that which hee had aduised them in the beginning, being
allied to the <hi>Etoliens:</hi> Then hee was forced to thinke of his departure
from <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Wherefore hee first solicited the King to send
them backe with an Army and sufficient munition. And when as the
King would not giue eare vnto it, he intreated him at the least to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him to depart with his family, for the time was now come, when as
great opportunities were offred to recouer his Fathers Realme. The
King neither considering the present, nor fore-seeing the future, for the
causes aboue specified, like an ouer-weening man, and without iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
neuer made any esteeme of <hi>Cleomenes.</hi> But <hi>Sosibius</hi> (who chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gouerned all the affaires of the Kingdome at that present) holding a
Councell with his Friends, was not of aduice to suffer <hi>Cleomenes</hi> to goe
with an Army at Sea, and munition, disdaining forreine affaires, and
holding this charge lost, considering the death of <hi>Antigonus:</hi> fearing
likewise that this death being so fresh, the way might be made easie to
stirre vp some Warre: And there being no man found to resist <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
he would soone make himselfe Lord of all the Citties in <hi>Greece.</hi>
Finally, they feared he would become their Enemy, considering the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
in regard of the Kings manner of life, which was well knowne vnto
them. With this disaduantage, that <hi>Sosibius</hi> saw the Prouinces of the
Realme to lie one farre from another, and to haue great opportunities of
reuolte.<note place="margin">An Army neere vnto <hi>Ephesus.</hi>
               </note> For there was neere vnto <hi>Samos</hi> a good number of Vessels, and
great Troupes of Souldiers neere vnto <hi>Ephesus.</hi> Wherefore he did not
hold it fit to send backe <hi>Cleomenes</hi> with an Army for the afore-sayd rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
But when they considered that it would not be profitable for their
Common-wealth, to let goe so great a personage, who afterwards might
proue their open Enemy, there was no preuention but to retaine him by
force. The which notwithstanding the rest disliked, conceiuing that there
would be great danger to keepe the Lyon and Sheepe in one fold. <hi>Sosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
was of the same opinion for that or the like cause.</p>
            <p>At such time as they resolued to take <hi>Mega</hi> and <hi>Beronice,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mega. Beronice.</note> and that
they feared to bring their enterprize to a good end, in regard of the
fiercenesse of <hi>Beronice,</hi> they were forced to drawe together all those
which followed the Court, and to make them great promises if they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed.
Then <hi>Sosibius</hi> knowing that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> wanted the Kings fuccours
to recouer his fathers Realme, and that he had found him by experience
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:16537:129"/>
to be wise and politicke in great affaires, he discouered his whole secrets
vnto him, propounding vnto him great hopes. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> seeing him
pensiue, and fearing the strangers and Mercenaries, perswaded him
not to care: promising him that the Souldiers should not trouble him,
and that moreouer they should giue him great assistance to bring his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize
to an end. And when as the other stood in admiration, doest
thou not see sayd <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> that there are about three thousand men
of <hi>Morea,</hi> and a thousand <hi>Candyots,</hi> all which will bring vs where
we please? Hauing these, whom else doest thou feare? What? The
Companions of the Warre of <hi>Syrria</hi> and <hi>Caria?</hi> And when as <hi>Sosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
liked of his words, hee entred more boldly into the Action. And
afterwards considering of the Kings soolery and negligence, hee often
called to minde this Speech, and had alwayes before his eyes the
Courage of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> and the affection the Souldiers bare him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
considering this, at the same time hee gaue the King and his other
familiars to vnderstand, that hee must seaze vpon him, and keepe him
close and priuate. For the working and effecting whereof, hee vsed
this meanes.</p>
            <p>There was one <hi>Nicagorus</hi> a <hi>Messenien,</hi> a friend to the father of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chidamus,</hi>
King of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> betwixt whom there had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
beene some friendship. But at such time as <hi>Archidamus</hi> was cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from <hi>Sparta</hi> for feare of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> and fled to <hi>Messena,</hi> hee not
onely gaue him a good reception into his House with his friends at his
first comming, but hee alwayes liued with him afterwards during his
flight, so as there grew a great and strict familiarity betwixt them.
When as after these things <hi>Cleomenes</hi> made shewe of some hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
with <hi>Archidamus, Nicagorus</hi> beganne to treate of the
Conditions of peace. VVhen the accord had beene made, and that
<hi>Nicagorus</hi> had taken the faith of <hi>Cleomenes, Archidamus</hi> returned to
<hi>Sparta,</hi> assuring himselfe of the conuentions of <hi>Nicagorus,</hi> whom
<hi>Cleomenes</hi> meeting vpon the way slew,<note place="margin">

               </note> suffering <hi>Nicagorus</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
to passe away. In regard of <hi>Nicagorus,</hi> he carried the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of a very thankfull man, for that he had saued his life: But hee
was vexed in his Soule, and incensed for the deede, for that hee see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to haue giuen the occasion.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Nicagorus</hi> had failed vnto <hi>Alexandria</hi> some little time before
with Horses: whereas going out of the ship, hee met with <hi>Cleomenes,
Panthee,</hi> and <hi>Hippite,</hi> walking vpon the strande: whom <hi>Cleomenes</hi>
perceiuing, saluted curteously, demaunding what businesse had brought
him thither: To whom he answered, that he had brought Horses. I
had rather sayd <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> thou hadst brought Concubines and Bawds:
for these are the things wherein the King at this day takes his chiefe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.
Then <hi>Nicagores</hi> held his peace smiling. VVhen as within few
dayes after he discoursed by chance with <hi>Sosibius</hi> by reason of the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
he related vnto him that which <hi>Cleomenes</hi> had arrogantly spoken

him great curtesies for the present, and promised him great fauours
hereafter: Finally hee wrought so, that imbarquing he left Letters
concerning <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> which a seruant of his brought after his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as sent from him. The which <hi>Nicagorus</hi> performing, the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
vsed speed to go vnto the King, assuring him that <hi>Nicagorus</hi> had
giuen him the Letters to carry to <hi>Sosibius.</hi> The Tenour whereof was,
That if <hi>Cleomenes</hi> were not soone dispatcht with an Army at Sea and
munition, he would raise some troubles within the Realme. <hi>Sosibius</hi>
imbracing this occasion,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cleomenes</hi> taken Prisoner, and put in Guard.</note> gaue the King and his Councell to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that this must not be heard with a deafe eare, and that he must
seaze vpon <hi>Cleomenes</hi> and giue him a Guard. The which being put in
execution, they gaue him a spacious House, where hee liued with
Guards, differing therein from other Prisoners, for that hee had a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

            <p>
               <hi>Cleomenes</hi> considering this, and hauing little hope for the future, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
to hazard all, and yet without hope to effect any thing, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in extreame despaire, but desiring to make an honourable Death,
and not to suffer any thing that might seeme vnfitting for the greatnesse
of his Courage. I immagine likewise that hee had an humour, and
had propounded to himselfe that, which commonly great Spirits doe
in these Tearmes:
<q>
                  <l>That in dishonour I doe not basely fall,</l>

And moreouer store of Wine. Whilest they made good cheere, and
were all drunke, hee goes out of the House with his Friends and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,

as if the Gate had beene ouer-throwne by the Treason of the Souldiers,
and that they should presently take it. But for that the Guards (fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing

and fauouring wicked men and Lyers.</p>
            <p>Finally, he was cruell and rough in his iudgements. But among

Generall of <hi>Seleucus</hi> his Army: For that he found him a man of
great Eloquence and great execution, hauing fauour and Authority in

hee kept it secret, seeking some occasion to effect his enterprize. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally

was not to be held of small importance, and that it was necessary the
King should approach the Countrey, holding himselfe ready when

that they should vse all diligence to make Warre against <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

that if the King were roundly beset with Warre, hee should neuer be
punished for the offences which hee had formerly committed: Neither
should hee loose his Authority for the necessity and continuall dangers

            <p>Wherefore in the end hee brought a counterfeite Letter, as sent from
<hi>Acheus</hi> to the King. The Tenour whereof was, that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> had
solicited him to enter into Warre, to get the Principallity, and that
hee would furnish him with money and munition, if he would take the

            <p>When as <hi>Molon</hi> was Lord of this Region, hauing a kinde of a
Realme, and was terrible euen before this Rebellion, in regard of the
great power of the Countrey, he shewed himselfe then more intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
towards the <hi>Asiens:</hi> For that at his arriuall the Kings Lieutenants
had abandoned their Campe, and that matters did not succeede in the

indeauoured to besiege <hi>Seleucia.</hi> But when as <hi>Zeux<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

The King aduertised of <hi>Molons</hi> Army, and of the flight of his
Lieutenants, resolued to lead his Army against him, leauing <hi>Ptolomy.</hi>
But <hi>Hermes</hi> remembring his enterprize, sent <hi>Xenoete</hi> an <hi>Achaian,</hi> with
an Army against <hi>Molon,</hi> saying that Lieutenants must fight with Rebels,
and the King with Kings in person. Keeping the King thus in awe by
reason of his Age, hee went to <hi>Apamia:</hi> where hee drew together an
Army, and from thence marcht suddainly to <hi>Laodicea.</hi> From whence
the King parting with all his Troupes, and hauing past a Desart, hee
came into a place which the Inhabitants of the Countrey called <hi>Marsia,</hi>

which they call <hi>Broches,</hi> and on the other that of <hi>Gerre:</hi> Betwixt the
which there is a rough and difficult way. The King marching for some
dayes by these streights, came in the end to <hi>Gerre:</hi> Whereas when he
saw that <hi>Theodote</hi> of <hi>Etolia</hi> had taken it, and <hi>Broches,</hi> and that hee had
sortified all that part of the streights, which were neere vnto the Fens,
with Ditches, and Pallisadoes, and men for the defence thereof, hee
laboured at the first to assayle them. But when it seemed he lost more
then hee got, by reason of the disaduantage of the place, and that
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:16537:132"/>
               <hi>Theodote</hi> made a shew to be of <hi>Ptolomies</hi> party, hee gaue ouer the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize.
And when he had newes of the retreate of <hi>Xenoete,</hi> and of
the attempt of <hi>Molon,</hi> he resolued to part from thence, and to giue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for his owne affaires.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xenoete</hi> being (as wee haue sayd) sent Generall against <hi>Molon,</hi> hee
had a greater power then was immagined, and vsed his friends with
great arrogancy, and his enemies with too much cruelty. When hee
tooke his way to <hi>Seleucia</hi> with his Army, calling vnto him <hi>Diogene</hi>
Gouernour of the Countrey of <hi>Susian,</hi> and <hi>Pythias</hi> of the red Sea, hee
marcht against the enemies, and planted his Campe neere vnto theirs,
the Riuer of <hi>Tygris</hi> being betwixt them. During the which there were
many came swimming from <hi>Molons</hi> Campe, aduertising him that the
greatest part of his Army would yeild vnto him, if he past the Riuer,
for that they hated him, and loued and affected the King. <hi>Xenoete</hi>
perswaded by their words, prepares himselfe to passe <hi>Tygris;</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
shew that hee would make his passage at a certaine place, where as
the Water makes an Iland, hee made no shewe of any preparation.
Whereupon whilest that <hi>Molon</hi> made no account of his enterprize, hee
prepared Boates speedily, and taking the best of his Horse-men, and
the Chiefe of all the Foot-men of his Army<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he left <hi>Zeuxis</hi> and <hi>Pythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>
for the Guard of the Campe; and past his Army safely in the night
by Boate fourescore furlongs beneath <hi>Molons</hi> Campe: During the
which he seated his Campe in a safe place, which was inuironed by
the Riuer for the greatest part, and the rest assured by Fens and Moores
adioyning.</p>
            <p>When as <hi>Molon</hi> was aduertised hereof, hee sent his Horse-men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to hinder their passage, or to defeate them that were past. Who
approaching neere to <hi>Xenoete,</hi> they annoyed themselues more (for that
they knew not the places) then they did the enemy: For entring into
those Moorish Fens, they could doe no seruice, and many perished.
<hi>Xenoete</hi> hoping that if hee approached neere vnto <hi>Molon,</hi> hee should
draw many of his men vnto him, marcht a slow pace a long the riuer
side, setting downe neere vnto the enemy. At what time <hi>Molon</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
his Baggage in the Campe, retired by night, doing it eyther by

which he had left with <hi>Zeuxis.</hi> Then calling them all together, hee
perswades them to be of good hope for the future, considering the flight
and despaire of <hi>Molon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This propose ended, hee commaunded them to go to their Repast,
and to be ready in morning to pursue their enemies: But all the souldiers
hearts puffed vp with the present successe, and stuffed with all sorts of
Booty, betooke themselues wholy to gormundizing and drunkennes,
and in the same sort of sloathfulnesse and negligence, that by custome
begets such things, passed the night. Now as <hi>Molon</hi> had gayned an

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:16537:132"/>
against the enemies, and finding them ouer-come and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Xenoete</hi> astonisht with so great and vnlookt for a businesse, could by no
meanes awake his people for their drunkennesse, but they were killed
by the enemies resisting by small Companies; and so the greatest part
were defeated within the Campe drowned in sleepe, the rest throwing
themselues into the Riuer, striuing to passe it by swimming: but the
most of them perished for all that in the end.<note place="margin">

themselues into the mercy of the Waues, and to passe therein, and
driue afore them the Carriages and Baggage, as if they thought by the
ayde of the Water, they could gaine or saue their Campe, but it came
to passe that in one selfe same time, Sumpter horses, Armes, and dead
bodies were borne by the Riuer, as if also a Vanquisher, a thing both
fearefull to relate, and also horrible to behold.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Molon</hi> had thus suddainly gayned the Campe of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and had passed the Riuer without danger, because there was

before the enemies approached, hee tooke also the Fort which was

            <p>
               <hi>Antioch</hi> hauing (as wee haue heretofore sayd) these newes, were
in fantasie to leaue the Warre in <hi>Syrria,</hi> and to prouide for this other
Countrey with an extreame diligence: they Assembled therefore those
of their Counsell, and as they had commaunded that euery one should
freely giue his aduice touching the Warre of <hi>Molon,</hi> and that <hi>Epigone</hi>
should be made fit, saying that long sithence things should haue beene
considered and lookt vnto, because the enemies should not haue their
courages so great to vndertake such things, because of their good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse:
To whom neuerthelesse they ought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:16537:133"/>
Then <hi>Hermes</hi> incensed againe, began to vse proud and iniurious spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
without reason: Hee inuented false slanders against <hi>Epigene,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching
the King not to leaue the Warre of <hi>Syrria</hi> so inconsiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Finally he grew into such a rage, as hee offended many and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
<hi>Antiochus.</hi> They could hardly pracifie his fury, although
the King vsed what meanes hee could to reconcile them. In the end
when the aduice of <hi>Epigene</hi> seemed the best vnto the assistants, it was
resolued in Councell that the Army should march against <hi>Molon,</hi> and
that there they should make the Warre.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hermes</hi> seeming presently to haue altered his aduice, sayd that all the
World must obserue that which the Councell had decreed, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
his duty to make prouision of all necessary things for the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of Warre. When the Troupes were assembled at <hi>Apamia,</hi> and
that there was a munity and a great discord growne amongst the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Souldies:<note place="margin">A mutiny in <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Campe.</note> 
               <hi>Hermes</hi> finding the King amazed and much troubled,
hee assured him to pacifie the rage and discontent of the Souldiers, and
to diuide and share the Corne quietly among them, if hee would
promise him neuer to carry <hi>Epigene</hi> with him in any exploits of Warre:
For that they could not performe any thing of importance in an Army,
being at so much difference and so incensed one against another. And
although the King disliked this, and was very much discontented at his
motion, for that hee knew by experience that <hi>Epigone</hi> was a man of
Councell, and actiue in Affaires of Warre, yet to preuent the present,
he sent him suddainly away: doubting that being circumuented by the
promises of <hi>Hermes,</hi> hee should not be master of himselfe. Which
beeing done, all the rest of the Kings Councell grew into great feare.
The Troupes also receiuing what Corne they desired, changed their
affection, and followed <hi>Hermes,</hi> except the <hi>Cyrrastres:</hi> Who beeing
sixe thousand men, mutined and abandoned the Kings seruice: Who
afterwards did him many affronts in his Warre at seuerall times. Yet
in the end they were defeated by a certaine Captaine of the Kings par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

forty dayes, hee went vnto <hi>Liba,</hi> where hee called a Councell.
And when as they consulted of the way which they should hold to find
<hi>Molon,</hi> and from whence and how they might recouer Victuals, (for
at that time hee made his abode in <hi>Babylon) Hermes</hi> was of opinion
that they should keepe their way vppon this side the Riuer of <hi>Tygris,</hi>
and along the Bankes; doubting and not a little fearing the Riuers of
<hi>Luque</hi> and <hi>Capre. Zeuxis</hi> was of another opinion; but hee durst not

hee with some difficulty deliuered his aduice, that they must passe
<hi>Tygris,</hi> aswell for many other difficulties which are on this side, as
for that they must of necessity, after they had past certaine places in
marching sixe daies iourney by a Desart Country, came vnto a Region
which they call <hi>Diorex,</hi> where the passage was not safe, for that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

<hi>Tygris,</hi> all the people of <hi>Appolonia,</hi> transported with ioy would come
vnto him, who at this day obeyed <hi>Molon,</hi> not for any affection, but
through necessity and feare: And withall they should haue abundance
of victuals, by reason of the fertility of the Countrey; and the passage
of <hi>Media</hi> would be shut vp for <hi>Molon,</hi> so as of necessity he should be
forced to come and fight: Or if hee fled, his Troupes would soone
yeild vnto the King. When the aduice of <hi>Zeuxis</hi> had beene allowed

three places. And marching from thence vnto <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>At the same time <hi>Molon</hi> hauing newes of the Kings comming, and

lately made subiect vnto him and by surprize, fearing moreouer that
the passage of <hi>Media</hi> was stopt, hee afterwards resolued to passe by
the Riuer <hi>Tygris</hi> speedily with his whole Army, making haste to gaine
the Woodes which bend towards the playnes of <hi>Apolonia,</hi> for that he
had great confidence in his Slingers, whom they call Cyrtles. When
hee approached neere these places, from the which the King parting
with his Army from <hi>Apolonia</hi> was not farre, it happened that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners
of eyther side, lightly armed, met vppon a Hill, where they
skirmished. But vpon the approach of both Armies, they began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
and the two Campes lodged within forty furlongs one of
another.</p>
            <p>When night came, <hi>Molon</hi> considering that a battaile by day with the
King would bee dangerous for him, not relying much vppon his men,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:16537:134"/>
he resolued to assaile <hi>Antiochus</hi> at mid-night. Wherefore hee made
choise of the ablest men of his whole Army, and takes his way by
vnknowne places, resoluing to charge the enemy from the higher
part: But being aduertised vppon the way, that ten of his Souldiers
had stollen away in the night, and retired vnto <hi>Antiochus,</hi> hee gaue
ouer his enterprize. So as taking another way, hee returned to the
Campe at the breake of day, the which was the chiefe cause of great
trouble in his Army: For they awaking with this suddaine and short
returne of their Companions, they were so terrified and amazed, as
they were in a manner ready to flie and abandon their Campe. <hi>Molon</hi>
when the trueth was knowne and well perceiued, pacified this terrour
and amazement what hee could, in so short a space, although it in some
part increased still.</p>
            <p>The King being ready to fight, drawes his Army to fielde at the
breake of day,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> puts his Army in Battaile.</note> and on the right Wing hee sets the Launces, vnder the
Commaund of <hi>Ardis,</hi> a man of great experience in the Warre. To
whom hee gaue for a supply the <hi>Candyots</hi> his Allies, and after them the
<hi>Gaules</hi> and <hi>Rhigosages:</hi> who were followed by the Souldiers of <hi>Greece,</hi>
and finally by a great battalion of Foote-men. In regard of the left
Wing, he gaue it to the Allies, which were all on horse-backe. Hee
likewise set the Elephants in Front betwixt the two Wings, beeing ten
in number. In regard of the supplies of Horse and Foote distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on eyther Wing, hee giues them charge to wheele about, and
to compasse in the enemy, as soone as the Battaile should beginne to
charge.</p>
            <p>After all this hee encourageth the Souldiers, telling them in few
words what was necessary for the present: And he giues to <hi>Hermes</hi> and
<hi>Zeuxis</hi> the leading of the left Wing, and takes the right vnto himselfe.
On the other side <hi>Molon</hi> drawes his Army to Field with great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and puts it but ill in Battaile, by reason of the disorder which had
happened in the night. Yet hee diuided his Horse-men in two wings,
thinking the enemy had done the like, placing the Targetteers and

            <p>This done, the two Armies marcht: <hi>Molons</hi> right Wing was loyall

But when as the left Wing drew somewhat neere vnto the King, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
to the enemy. This happening, <hi>Molons</hi> Troupes fainted sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely:
And the Kings Army grew more sto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Diganes:</hi> and put many to death in Prison by the Sword. But the

from them for a punishment of their reuolte, onely fourescore and ten

Counselled him to be aduised for his owne good, and his friends, not

the banished men of <hi>Seleucia,</hi> and restored vnto them the gouernment

            <p>When as <hi>Antiochus</hi> had besieged the Towne of <hi>Dure,</hi> and saw that
hee could not preuaile, as well for its fortification, as for the defence of
<hi>Nicholas:</hi> in the beginning of Winter hee concluded a truce with <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomes</hi>

out of the Prouince, and to doe him all the pleasure hee could, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

to winter in <hi>Seleucia,</hi> for that <hi>Acheus</hi> made shew to bee of his side, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in truth he held <hi>Ptolomes</hi> party. After the truce concluded,

from whence he sent them to winter in Garrisons, and from
that time hee began to neglect all care in exercising his Souldiers,
thinking hee should haue no more occasion of fighting: For that hee
held many places in base <hi>Syrria</hi> and <hi>Phenicea,</hi> hoping that the rest
would be soone reduced to his obedience: considering that <hi>Ptolomy</hi>
durst not come to fight. His Embassadours thought no lesse, for that
<hi>Sosibius</hi> had giuen them faire and courteous words at <hi>Caire:</hi> And not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

were the true and lawfull Lords. Wherefore the Realme of base

to the end he might conquer all the Empire of <hi>Asia</hi> for <hi>Seleucus,</hi> and
make <hi>Syrria</hi> and <hi>Phenicea</hi> his owne. These difficulties with diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
were many times debated betwixt them: but they could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
any thing, although matters were solicited by their common

spoken of: holding it a strange thing, that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> should presume to

            <p>Then againe he takes those that were lightly armed, whom hee had
sent before with <hi>Nicarche</hi> and <hi>Theodote,</hi> and goes to discouer the
streights which <hi>Nicholas</hi> had formerly taken: so as after hee had well
viewed the places, hee returned to his Campe. Where the next day
hee left those that were best armed, vnder the charge of <hi>Nicarche,</hi> and
marched with the rest against the Enemy. And for that Mount <hi>Liban</hi>
doth much restraine those places towards the Sea-shoare, the way must
of necessity be narrow, difficult, and almost inaccessible: leauing a
streight and short passage towards the Sea. Whereas <hi>Nicholas</hi> hauing

then built his Fort, hee did hope he should be well able to repulse <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus:</hi>
For that he had put him selfe into it with a good number of

of <hi>Diocles.</hi> Hee put himselfe among the Baggage to see all, and
to succour where neede should require. At the same time <hi>Diogenet</hi> and
<hi>Perigene</hi> began to fight at Sea, approaching as neere to Land as possibly
they could: so as they might see the Combats by Land and Sea with
one view.<note place="margin">A Combat at Sea and Land.</note> The Trumpets sounding to the charge, the fight was long
equall at Sea: so as the Victory inclined to neither side: for that the
two Armies were equall in number of men and preparation of Warre.
In regard of the fight at Land, <hi>Nicholas</hi> had the better in the beginning,
for that hee had the aduantage of the place. But when as they which
were with <hi>Theodote,</hi> came vpon them from the top of the Mountaine,
and charged them with great fury, <hi>Nicholas</hi> and his men fled shamefully.

into the which the Riuer which they call <hi>Iordan,</hi> passeth: then takes its
course by the Countrey of that Towne which is called <hi>Scithes.</hi> After
the suddaine taking of these two Townes, he enters into great hope for
the future, for that their Fields were sufficient to furnish his Army with
all kind of victuals, and other munitions for the war. There he placed suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient

of fame or praise to be propounded, for that they were newly come
vnto their Principallities. Wherefore they laboured to encourage
their Troupes, in reducing to their memory the glory and prowesse
of their Ancestors: And propounding moreouer a hope of themselues
for the future, they intreated and solicited the Captaines to fight, and
to vndergoe the danger resolutely and with courage. These were
the speeches or such like, which they vsed in person, or by their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters.</p>
            <p>This done, the two Kings marcht one against the other, a slow pace.
<hi>Ptolomy</hi> was in the left Wing,<note place="margin">A Battaile be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> and <hi>Antiochus</hi> in the right with his royal
Battalion. Then the Trumpets sounded to Battaile, whereof the first
Charge was made by the Elephants. Few of <hi>Ptolomes</hi> held good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
those of the Enemy, whose Souldiers fought valliantly, casting
of Darts, Pertwisans, and plummets of lead, wounding one another.
But the Elephants made a stronger Warre;<note place="margin">The Combate of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants.</note> beating their Heads furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
together: For such is the manner of their fight, assailing one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
with their teeth, and standing firme they repulse one another
with great Violence: But if they once turne their sides they wound
with their Teeth, as Buls do with their Hornes. But the greatest part
of <hi>Ptolomes</hi> feared the Combate:<note place="margin">The Elephants of <hi>Lybia</hi> feare them of India.</note> the which doth vsually happen to
the Elephants of <hi>Lybia:</hi> For they cannot indure the sent, not heare the
crye of those of <hi>India.</hi> So as fearing (as it seemes) their greatnesse
and force, they flye them, as it happened at that time, for that flying
suddainly they brake the rankes of their owne men, and made a great
slaughter in <hi>Ptolomes</hi> great Battallion.</p>
            <p>The which <hi>Antiochus</hi> perceiuing, hee presently chargeth <hi>Polycrates</hi>
Horse-men with the Elephants. The <hi>Grecians</hi> about his great Battalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
fell vpon <hi>Ptolomes</hi> Targetteers. Wherefore when the Elephants
had broken them, his left Wing beganne to turne head. When <hi>Eche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
Commaunder of the right Wing, (expecting still the Combate
of the sayd Wings) saw the Dust rise in the Ayre, and that his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants
durst not charge the Enemies, he sends to <hi>Phoxide</hi> Captaine of
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:16537:142"/>
the Mercenaries to charge those which he had in Front: The which
he did likewise, marching a slow pace with the Horse-men and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants.
There the Combate was long and furious: yet <hi>Echecrates</hi>
being freed from the danger of the Elephants, and making a great
slaughter of the Horse-men, and withall <hi>Phoxide</hi> pressing the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi>
and <hi>Medes.</hi> In the end <hi>Antiochus</hi> his left wing was put to flight.
By this meanes <hi>Antiochus</hi> right wing vanquished, and the left fled. The
two great Battalions stood firme and vntoucht, being in doubt of the
end. And when as <hi>Ptolomy</hi> in the meane time had recouered his great
Troupe by his speedy running, and was in the middest of them, hee
amazed his Enemies, and gaue great courage vnto his owne Captaines
and Souldiers.</p>
            <p>In the meane time King <hi>Antiochus</hi> being young and of small experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in the Warre, seeing himselfe Victorious of the one side, thought
the like of the rest, and pursued the Chase of the Enemy with great
eagernesse. But when as one of his old Souldiers cald him backe, and
shewed him the Dust which a great Troupe had raisde in his Fort, hee
then knew what it meant: and turning head he laboured to recouer his
Campe. But when hee found that all his Army was in Rout,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ptolomes</hi> Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry against <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
               </note> then
wanting good Counsell he fled to <hi>Raphia,</hi> immagining that it was not
his fault hee had not obtained a glorious and Triumphant Victory, and
that the basenesse and sloath of his men had beene the cause of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feate.
<hi>Ptolomy</hi> hauing the Victory by the meanes of his chiefe Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
and hauing lost many of his Horse-men and Souldiers of the
right Wing, hee returned to his Campe, and refresht his Army. The
next day, he caused his men to be sought out among the Dead, and
buried.</p>
            <p>From thence (after they had stript the Enemies that were slaine) hee
marcht with his Army to <hi>Raphia.</hi> And although that <hi>Antiochus</hi> (ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
together his men that fled) had a desire to keepe his Campe,
and to leaue the Towne, yet he was forced to goe to <hi>Raphia:</hi> For that
the greatest part of his Souldiers were retired thither. The next day
earely in the morning, he parts with that small Army, which he had
remaining after so great a defeate, and went to <hi>Gaza:</hi> Where planting
his Campe, he sent men to demaund the dead bodies, and to interre
them. <hi>Antiochus</hi> lost aboue ten Thousand foote, and three hundred
Horse. There were about foure thousand foote-men taken aliue. In
regard of the Elephants, there were three slaine vpon the fielde, and
two wounded which dyed afterwards: most of the rest were taken.
This was the ende of that famous battaile, where as two powerfull
and might Kings fought for the Empire of <hi>Syrria,</hi> neere vnto
<hi>Raphia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When as <hi>Antiochus</hi> had buried the dead, hee returned into his
Countrey with his Army. As for <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> hee presently recouered
<hi>Raphia,</hi> with the other Citties, so as the people contended who should
preuent his neighbour, in yeilding first vnto the King. In such euents
euery man striues to apply himselfe vnto the time. It is true, that the
people of that Countrey are borne and inclined to imbrace the fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

of the present time. But for asmuch as the people had a special deuotion
to the Kings of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> what they then did was held iust and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable.
The people of base <hi>Syrria</hi> haue alwaies affected this royall
House. And therefore they honoured <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> with Flowers, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
Altars, and such like things. When as <hi>Antiochus</hi> was come
to the Citty,<note place="margin">

               </gap> to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> to
demaund a peace of him: For without doubt hee feared his forces,
neither did hee much relie vpon his owne souldiers, considering the
losse which hee had lately made. Hee likewise doubted that <hi>Acheus</hi>
might mooue Warre against him, considering the opportunity of the
time and occasion.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> hee thought not of all this: But beeing ioyfull of
so great a Fortune, which hee expected not, holding himselfe happy
to enioy all <hi>Syrria,</hi> hee refused not the conditions of peace. So as
being lull'd a sleepe with this base kinde of life, which hee had alwaies
vsed, his heart was much inclined thereunto. When the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
presented themselues vnto him, he granted them a peace for a

               </note> in the which the great

differs so much from Prudence and Industry, not only in a priuate life,
but also in publique Affaires, that ease and plenty seeme to procure losse

of the other. The <hi>Rhodiens</hi> made these things great and ruinous, and

But when we consider the Commodity of the place, and the great fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity

there is no more any cause of admiration: Being certaine that this get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

            <p>When in the beginning of Summer, <hi>Agote</hi> being then Chiefe of

being expired, (in my opinion this is the passage, where we last turn'd

the <hi>Eliences,</hi> against the <hi>Messeniens. Arate</hi> found the trained men of
<hi>Acheia</hi> ill disciplined, and the Townes carelesse of the duties of War:
For that <hi>Epirate,</hi> who before him had the Gouernment, had (as wee
haue sayd) carried himselfe idly and carelesly in all things. But when
he had acquainted the <hi>Acheins</hi> therewith, and receiued their order, he
applied himselfe wholy to the preparation of the Warre.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Arate</hi> prepares for the Warre.</note> Their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
was, that they should not leuy lesse then eight thousand Aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers,

It was also ordered that they should prepare three Shippes in the Gulfe
of <hi>Argos,</hi> and as many neere vnto <hi>Patres</hi> and <hi>Dyme. Arate</hi> was then
carefull to leuy men, and to make ready the Army. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> and
<hi>Pyrrhie</hi> after they had appointed a day for their departure, tooke their
way to <hi>Messene:</hi> Whereof the Chiefe of the <hi>Acheins</hi> being aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
hee came to <hi>Megalopolis</hi> with the Aduenturers, and some of those

the Towne of <hi>Calames</hi> by Treason: And from thence going on his

came to <hi>Elis</hi> ill accompanied, to assaile the <hi>Messeniens,</hi> he turned head
presently, being repuls'd by the <hi>Cyparisseins.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Lycurgus</hi> tooke
his way to <hi>Sparta,</hi> hauing done nothing worthy of memory, for that
hee could not ioyne with <hi>Pyrrhie,</hi> neyther was hee strong enough to
mannage the Warre alone. <hi>Arate</hi> seeing the Enemies frustrated of their
hope, and thereby fore-seeing the future, hee commaunded <hi>Taurion</hi>
to prepare fifty Horse, and fiue hundred foote, and that the <hi>Messeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens</hi>
should send as many, meaning with this force to defend the <hi>Mega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopolitains,
Tegeates,</hi> and <hi>Argiues,</hi> from the incursions of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
For that those Countries lye more in danger of the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
during the Warre, ioyning vpon the <hi>Spartains</hi> Countrey. Finally,
he resolued to Guard <hi>Acheia,</hi> with the <hi>Acheins</hi> and Mercenaries, from
the danger of the <hi>Elyences</hi> and <hi>Etoliens.</hi> This done, hee pacified the
Discord, which was growne among the <hi>Megalopolitains,</hi> according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that which the <hi>Acheins</hi> had ordered.</p>
            <p>For you must vnderstand that the <hi>Megalopolitains,</hi> beeing a little
before chased out of their owne Countrey by <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> had neede of
many things which were wanting: And although they still maintained

their authority,<note place="margin">A Mutiny a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galopolitains.</hi>
               </note> yet they had neither victuals nor necessary expences, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the publique or priuate: So as all was full of mutiny, rage, and
malice. The which doth vsuall fall out in Common-weales, and among
priuate persons, when as victuals faile. First they were in debate among
themselues concerning the walls of the City, some being of opinion that
that they should not make the inclosure greater, then their power would
then beare, and keepe it with so small a number of men, considering it
had bin the cause of their former danger, for that it was greater and more
spacious then the power of the Inhabitants was able to defend. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
they were of aduice, that such as had Lands, should contribute the
third part, to the end they might people the City: Others said, that they
must not giue a lesse circuite to the City, nor contribute the third part of
their possession: But their chiefest contention was concerning the Laws
written by <hi>Pritanides,</hi> an excellent man among the <hi>Peripatetiques,</hi> whom
<hi>Antigonus</hi> had giuen them for a Law-giuer. The City being in these
combustions, <hi>Arate</hi> pacified them, and quencht the quarrels which were
inflamed among the <hi>Megalopolitains,</hi> as well publique as priuate. Finally
they haue grauen the Articles agreed vpon on a Pillar seated in the <hi>Oma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi>

            <p>At the same time the Captaine of the Sea-army for the <hi>Acheins</hi> came

where when as the Townes-men came out against him, he tooke two
Gallies armed, and furnished with all things necessary, with many other

made the Souldiers more hardy and resolute for the future. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side the Cities were in better hope, for that they were not forced

side <hi>Euripides</hi> going to Field with a good number of <hi>Etoliens,</hi> wasted
the Country of the <hi>Tritenses. Lyceus</hi> and <hi>Demodochus</hi> particular Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
of the <hi>Acheins,</hi> aduertised of the descent of the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> drew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
the <hi>Dimenses, Patrenses,</hi> and <hi>Pharenses,</hi> with the Aduenturers, and
ouer-ran the Country of the <hi>Etoliens.</hi> Being come to a place which they
call <hi>Phixia,</hi> they sent their Foot-men that were lightly armed, with their
Horse-men to ouer-run the Champaigne Country, and log'd their men
that were best armed in Ambush thereabouts. When the <hi>Elienses</hi> came
to charge them without order to succour their people, passing the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush,
<hi>Lyceus</hi> Company fell vpon them:<note place="margin">A defeate of the <hi>Elienses</hi> by <hi>Lyceus.</hi>
               </note> whose fury they being vnable to
resist, fled, so as there were about two hundred slaine, and foure score ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Prisoners with all the Booty.</p>
            <p>At the same time the Commander of the <hi>Acheins</hi> Sea-army, hauing
sailed often to <hi>Calidon</hi> and <hi>Naupacte,</hi> spoiled the whole Countrey, and
chased the Enemy twice. He also tooke <hi>Cleonice</hi> of <hi>Naupacte,</hi> who for
that he was a friend to the <hi>Acheins,</hi> had no harme: but within few daies
after was freed without ransome. At the same time <hi>Agete</hi> Chiefe of the
<hi>Etoliens,</hi> assembled a Troupe of them, putting the Country of the <hi>Acar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanians</hi>
to fire and sword, and spoiled the Country of <hi>Epirus.</hi> This done,
he returnes home, giuing leaue to the Souldiers to retire to their houses.
Afterwards the <hi>Acarnanians</hi> made a descent into the Country of <hi>Strate:</hi>
where being repuls'd by the Enemy, they made a shamefull retreate, yet
without any losse; for that the <hi>Stratenses</hi> durst not pursue them, fearing
an Ambush. At the same time there was a Treason practised in the
Country of the <hi>Phanotenses</hi> after this manner. <hi>Alexander</hi> Gouernour
of <hi>Phosis</hi> for <hi>Philip,</hi> laide a plot for the <hi>Etoliens</hi> by a certaine man called
<hi>Iason,</hi> to whom he had giuen the gouernment of the <hi>Phanotenses.</hi> He
was sent to <hi>Agete</hi> Chiefe of the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> promising to deliuer the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse
of <hi>Phanotenses</hi> vnto him: whereupon they agree and sweare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>When the day appointed was come, <hi>Agete</hi> comes in the Night with
the <hi>Etoliens:</hi> when he had laid his Troupe in Ambush, he made choise of
a hundred men,<note place="margin">The <hi>Etoliens</hi> circumuented by a Stratagem.</note> whom he sent to the Fort. <hi>Iason</hi> hauing <hi>Alexander</hi> ready
with him, with a sufficient number of Souldies, receiues the companions
into the Fortresse, according to the accord: whom <hi>Alexander</hi> charged
with his Company, and tooke all the <hi>Etoliens.</hi> But when day was come,
<hi>Agete</hi> assured of the fact, carried backe his Army into his Country, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

into <hi>Macedony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this meanes he freed them from all feare of the <hi>Dardanians,</hi> who
could not make any incursions into <hi>Macedony,</hi> the entry being stopt
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:16537:145"/>
by the taking of the said Towne: whereas placing a good Garrison, he
sent <hi>Chrysagonus</hi> with great speed into high <hi>Macedony,</hi> to make anew le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
of men. As for himselfe he tooke some men and went into <hi>Beocia,</hi> and
<hi>Amphaxate,</hi> and came to <hi>Edesa:</hi> where expecting <hi>Chrysogonus</hi> with the
<hi>Macedonians,</hi> he parted presently after with the whole Army, and came
to <hi>Larissa</hi> on the sixt day: And pursuing his course from thence all night,
he arriued at <hi>Melitea,</hi> the which he indeauoured to take by <hi>Scalado,</hi> and
if the Ladders had not beene something too short, without doubt he had
preuailed in his Enterprize: wherein the Commanders are chiefely to
be blamed. For when some of them make haste rashly and inconsiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to take Townes,<note place="margin">The indiscreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders blamed.</note> without any fore-sight or consideration of the walls,
vallies and such like, by the which they attempt the taking by an assault,
who will not blame them? And although they haue duely considered of
all things, yet who will not taxe them to giue the charge to the first man
they meet, to prepare ladders, &amp; such like instruments, as a thing of small
consequence? Finally, in such actions they must doe that which is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
or else fall into danger. For the losse doth often follow the despaire,
and in many kinds: First the ablest men are in danger of the attempt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
vpon the retreate, when they begin to disdaine them Whereof
there are many examples. And you shall find in such attempts many fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated,
some defeated, others to haue bin in extreame danger: And they
they which haue saued themselues, haue bin subiect for the future to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust
and hatred: and some haue serued for an example, to all others to be
vigilant, giuing not only to such as were present at the danger, but also to
them that heare of it, some kind of admonishment to be careful of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
Wherefore they must neuer make vse of such aduice rashly: In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the meanes to vse it wel, it is secure if they follow reason.</p>
            <p>We must now returne to our discourse, and speake thereon hereafter,
when occasion shall be offred, and that it is not possible to faile in such
enterprizes. <hi>Philip</hi> preuented in his enterprizes, plants his Campe neare
vnto the Riuer of <hi>Empe,</hi> and sent his men to <hi>Larissa,</hi> and other Townes,
whom he had leuied in the winter for the Siege: For all his designe was
to take <hi>Thebes.</hi> It is a Towne scituated neare to the Sea,<note place="margin">The scituation of <hi>Thebes.</hi>
               </note> ans about 300.
Furlongs from <hi>Larissa.</hi> It confines fitly with <hi>Magnesia</hi> and <hi>Thessaly:</hi> To
the one side called <hi>Demetriade:</hi> And to <hi>Thessaly</hi> on that part where the
<hi>Pharsaliens</hi> and <hi>Pherenses</hi> dwell. This City doth much annoy the <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saliens</hi>
and <hi>Demetriens:</hi> For that the <hi>Etoliens</hi> held it at that time: The like
they did to them of <hi>Larissa:</hi> for the <hi>Etoliens</hi> made many incursions into
the Country which the Inhabitants call <hi>Namirice.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Philip</hi>
considering that such things ought not to be neglected, and left behind,
he sought all meanes to take it. Wherefore he prouided a hundred slings
and fiue and twenty great Cros-bowes, and approached the City of
<hi>Thebes</hi> with his Army, the which he diuided into three Troups, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged
it on three sides: whereof he placed the one neere vnto <hi>Scopia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Thebes</hi> besieged by <hi>Philip.</hi>
               </note> the
other at <hi>Heliotropia,</hi> and the third neare vnto the Mountaine which
lookes into the City: Fortifying the spaces in the Field with Ditches
and double Pallisadoes. Moreouer he built Towers of wood in euery
space of two Acres of ground with sufficient guards.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:16537:146"/>
Then he drawes together all the preparation for the War, and begins
to plant his Engins of Battery against the Fort. Yet the three first dayes
he could not make his approaches to set vp his Engines, so great was the
courage and resolution of those which fought vpon the walls. But after
that by the combat, and by the multitude of Darts, part of the Burgesses
were slain, and others wounded, and that the besieged ceased for a time,
the <hi>Macedonians</hi> began to mine: where working continually, although
the ground were bad, they approached vnto the wall on the ninth day.</p>
            <p>From that time they were continually imployed in battering the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
so as the Slings and great Cros-bowes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>euer ceased day nor night:
And within three daies they made a breach of foure score Fathomes in
the wall. And when the supporters made vnto the wall, were not able to
beare the burthen, they fell, and brought the wall downe with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Macedonians</hi> had set them on fire. This being done, when as
their courages encreased, and that they made shew to enter,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Thebes</hi> yeelded to <hi>Philip.</hi>
               </note> and begin an
assault, the <hi>Thebins</hi> being amazed, yeelded themselues and their Citty.
When as <hi>Philip</hi> had by this meanes assured the Countries of <hi>Magnesia</hi>
and <hi>Thessaly,</hi> he tooke the best of the <hi>Etoliens</hi> goods, and thrust the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Inhabitants out of the towne, re-peopling it with <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and
changing its name of <hi>Thebes,</hi> he called it <hi>Philiopolis.</hi> Whilest that <hi>Philip</hi>
stayed in this City, there came Embassadours from <hi>Chios, Rhodes, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>
and from King <hi>Ptolomy.</hi> Whom when he had answered,<note place="margin">Embassadours come to <hi>Philip.</hi>
               </note> as he
had formerly done, (that he had beene alwaies willing to hearken to a
peace) he sent them away, giuing them charge to vnderstand the will of
the <hi>Etoliens.</hi> For his part he made no reckoning of peace, being resolued
to continue his attempts. Wherefore being aduertised, that the Vessels
of <hi>Scerdilaide</hi> spoild all the Coast of <hi>Malea,</hi> and that hee intreated the
Merchants as Enemies, and that moreouer he had taken (breaking the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord)
some ships at <hi>Leucade,</hi> he armes twelue Vessels couered, and eight
open, and sailes by the <hi>Euripus,</hi> hauing likewise thirty Merchants Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
hoping to take the <hi>Sclauonians:</hi> neither did he neglect the <hi>Etolien</hi>
War, for that he was not yet aduertised of the actions which had past in
<hi>Italy.</hi> For at such time as <hi>Philip</hi> held <hi>Thebes</hi> besieged, the <hi>Romans</hi> had
beene vanquished by <hi>Hannibal</hi> in <hi>Tuscany:</hi> But the newes were not yet
come into <hi>Greece.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Philip</hi> had taken the <hi>Sclauonian</hi> Vessels, and for this cause had
sailed into <hi>Cenchrea,</hi> he caused the ships that were couered to run along
the Coasts of <hi>Malea</hi> towards <hi>Egia</hi> and <hi>Patres,</hi> and stayes the rest of the
Vessels in the Port of <hi>Leche.</hi> Then he makes haste to goe to the <hi>Nemeen</hi>
Game, and arriued at <hi>Argos.</hi> Being at the sight, he had letters from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedony</hi>
to aduertise him that the <hi>Romans</hi> had bin vanquished by <hi>Hannibal</hi>
with a wonderfull defeate, and that they were masters of their Campe.
He presently shews it only to <hi>Demetrius,</hi> charging him to keepe it secret.
Who taking his occasion thereby, began to intreate the King that in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching
the <hi>Etolien</hi> War speedily, he would attend that of the <hi>Sclauoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
for that al <hi>Greece</hi> then obeyed him: The which they would do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after:
For that the <hi>Acheins</hi> affected him, and the <hi>Etoliens</hi> feared his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
considering the losses they had made during this War: and that as
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:16537:146"/>
for <hi>Italy,</hi> the voyage which he should make, would be a beginning to
conquer the Monarchy, the which did more iustly belong to him then
to any other, and that moreouer the opportunity was great for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
considering the great defeate of the <hi>Romans</hi> which <hi>Han<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ibal</hi> had
made. <hi>Demetrius</hi> vsing these meanes, perswaded the King, who was
but young, and of a high spirit, and too desirous of rule.</p>
            <p>Afterwards <hi>Philip</hi> called his Councell, and began to aduise touching
a peace with the <hi>Etoliens.</hi> To the which <hi>Arate</hi> would willingly haue
assisted: the King presently sent <hi>Cleomice</hi> from <hi>Naupacte</hi> to the <hi>Etoliens,</hi>
not expecting the Embassadours, to propound publiquely the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a Peace: For he found <hi>Arate</hi> after the taking of <hi>Thebes,</hi> attending
the Diet of the <hi>Acheins.</hi> In the meane time he tooke ships at <hi>Corinthe,</hi>
with the Bands of Foot men, and came to <hi>Egia,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Las<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
whereafter he had taken a Tower in the <hi>Peripes,</hi> hee made shew
to enter into the <hi>Elienses</hi> Countrey: to the end they should not thinke
that he much affected a peace. And when as <hi>Cleomice</hi> had returned
twice or thrice, and that the <hi>Etoliens</hi> intreated the King to goe vnto
them, he willingly yeelded thereunto. Then sending Letters speedily
to all the Townes of the Allies, the great fire of the Warre being now
quencht, he aduertised them to send Embassadours to compound and
make a peace with the <hi>Etoliens.</hi> And in the interim he transports his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and planted his Campe neare vnto <hi>Panormus,</hi> which is a Port of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea</hi>
right against <hi>Naupacte,</hi> expecting the Embassadours of the Allies.
Whilest they assembled, he went to <hi>Zacynthe,</hi> and pacified the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of that Island, then suddainly he returned to the same place. When
the Embassadours were met, he sent <hi>Arate</hi> and <hi>Taurion</hi> with some others
to the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> who being come vnto them (for they were assembled at
<hi>Neupacte</hi>) they had some conference: where vnderstanding the desire
they had of peace, they returned speedily to <hi>Philip,</hi> and aduertised him
thereof. The <hi>Etoliens</hi> desiring it wonderfully, sent an Embassie with
them vnto the King, intreating him to come vnto them with his Army,
to the end their differences might be the better and sooner decided.
<hi>Philip</hi> wone by their intreaties, sailed with his forces to a place twenty
furlongs from <hi>Naupacte.</hi> There landing with his men, after he had forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
his Campe and ships with Ditches and Pallisadoes, hee stayed the
comming of the <hi>Etoliens.</hi> Who came vnto the King without Armes:
And making a stand two Furlongs from his Campe, they presently sent
men to conferre of the differences which they had at that time. The
King sent first vnto them all those which were there present for the alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Cities,<note place="margin">A peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Eloliens</hi>
               </note> giuing them charge to conclude a peace with them, vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that hereafter euery man should keepe that which he presently
held. And when they had so concluded, they afterwards sent many Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
for the particular actions of either side. Of which things we haue
willingly omitted the greatest part, for that there is nothing seemes wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of memory yet I haue thought good to relate in few words the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrances
which <hi>Agelaus</hi> of <hi>Naupacte</hi> made to the King &amp; the Allies.</p>
            <p>When he was allowed to speake,<note place="margin">The Speech of <hi>Agelaus.</hi>
               </note> and that all men were attentiue to
heare him: It is needfull (saith he) the <hi>Grecians</hi> should haue no Warre
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:16537:147"/>
among themselues, and they should giue thankes vnto the Gods, if all
with one accord (like vnto those which passe the Riuers holding hands)
may be able to repulse the attempts of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
and their Citties: and if this cannot be continually entertained,
yet at the least they should at this day apply themselues vnto it, for that
<hi>Greece</hi> was neuer in great danger: saying that he considered the great
Armies, and the great Warre which would soone follow: making no
doubt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> did vanquish the <hi>Romans</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> or
the <hi>Romans</hi> them, neither the one nor the other would content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
with the Empire of <hi>Sicily</hi> or <hi>Italy:</hi> But the Victors would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
extend themselues farther then were fit, and would passe towards
the East.</p>
            <p>Wherefore they must all prouide for it, and especially <hi>Philip.</hi> The
which he can no otherwise doe, but in quenching this present War, and
cease to torment the Citties of <hi>Greece:</hi> And that contrariwise he haue a
care of all, as of one Body, and study for the safety thereof in generall
as his owne, and subiect vnto him. Doing which all the <hi>Grecians</hi> will
loue him, and sight with him like good men in his future Warres: And
finally the <hi>Barbarians</hi> fearing the loyalty of the <hi>Grecians</hi> towards him,
will not attempt any thing against his Empire. The which if hee had
a desire to enlarge, he must attempt against the Westerne Countries,
and consider in what estare the affaires of <hi>Italy</hi> now stand, and that more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
the time was come, when he might easily hope for the Empire of
all the world. To effect the which he should be the lesse troubled, for
that the <hi>Romans</hi> had beene defeated by <hi>Hannibal</hi> at the Lake of <hi>Perousa.</hi>
Finally, he perswades the King to exchange the Warre and Discords of
<hi>Greece</hi> into Peace and Concord, and that he should striue with all his
power to keepe himselfe at liberty for the future, that he might be able
to make Peace and Warre when he pleased. Moreouer, he sayd, that
if he suffred this Cloud which they saw arising towards the West, of a
cruell and mortall Warre once to approach neere the Countries of
<hi>Greece,</hi> he feared much that these Quarrels and Contentions which
were amongst them, would be found so farre out of their power, as they
would not be able to pray vnto the Gods to haue meanes to make War
or Peace at their pleasure.</p>
            <p>When as <hi>Agelaus</hi> had ended his Speech, he inflamed the hearts of
the Allies to peace, and especially <hi>Philip:</hi> for that moued by the words
of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> he had fixt his minde vpon it. Wherefore they all with
one accord made a peace with the <hi>Etoliens.</hi> The which being confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
they retired all into their Countries. These things were done in the
third yeare of the hundred and fortieth Olympiade: I meane that Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile
which the <hi>Romans</hi> gaue in <hi>Tuscany,</hi> with the warre of <hi>Antiochus</hi> in
<hi>Syrria,</hi> and the peace made betwixt the <hi>Etoliens, Philip</hi> and the <hi>Acheins.</hi>
Behold the time wherein the Warres of <hi>Greece, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi>
were first intermixt. For after that day neither <hi>Philip,</hi> nor the other
Princes of <hi>Greece</hi> attempted any thing either for Warre or Peace,
but had their eyes wholly fixed vpon <hi>Italy.</hi> Soone after the Ilands
of <hi>Asia</hi> did the like, and all they which were either Enemies vnto
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:16537:147"/>
               <hi>Philip,</hi> or any way opposite vnto <hi>Attalus,</hi> retyred not to <hi>Antiochus,</hi>
nor vnto <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> nor to the Southerne or Easterne parts, but all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the West. Some solicited the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> other did the like to the
<hi>Romans</hi> by continuall Embassies. The <hi>Romans</hi> likewise fearing the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and courage of <hi>Phillip,</hi> sent Embassadours into <hi>Greece.</hi> And as
we haue according to our first resolution, plainly set down, as I conceiue,
when and how, and for what causes the Affaires of <hi>Greece</hi> are intermixt

The like did the other Cities of <hi>Morea:</hi> So as they laboured their lands

were in a manner forgotten by reason of the continuall warre. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that as they of <hi>Morea</hi> among all other men are inclined to a milde
and curteous kind of life, the which in precedent times they did not
enioy: Being as <hi>Euripides</hi> saith, alwaies tormented by their neighbours,
and without rest. Yet it seemeth reasonable for, for all they which tend

neere vnto <hi>Lylibeum,</hi> his Courage increased, and hee proceeded in his

neere those Countries which are about the Riuer of <hi>Loia,</hi> which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

times befall Armies at Land: For some of his Vessels which followed

the mouth of the <hi>Ionian</hi> gulfe, came by night to <hi>Philip,</hi> telling him
that they had spoken with some of the <hi>Sycillian</hi> Sea, who aduertised
them, that they had left the <hi>Roman</hi> Quinqueremes about <hi>Rhegium,</hi> ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

               <hi>Philip</hi> immagining that

            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:16537:148"/>
It hapned that this was a false Allarum: For you must vnderstand
that <hi>Scerdilaide</hi> aduertised of the great multitude of Vessels which <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
had drawne together in Winter, and fearing his comming by Sea,
had obtained succours from the <hi>Romans</hi> by his Embassadours:<note place="margin">Succours sent by the <hi>Romans</hi> to <hi>Scerdilaide.</hi>
               </note> So as
they sent him ten ships out of their Fleete which was at <hi>Lilybeum,</hi> the
which passing neere vnto <hi>Rhegium</hi> were discouered. If the King had
not beene amazed without reason, he might well haue vanquisht them,
and performed his Enterprize against <hi>Sclauonia:</hi> And the rather for that
the <hi>Romans</hi> had receiued a wonderfull losse neere vnto <hi>Cannes</hi> against
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> where they were in a manner quite ruined. But being then
terrified without cause, he made a safe flight into <hi>Macedony,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
infamous.</p>
            <p>At the same time <hi>Prusias</hi> did an Act worthy of memory: For when
as the <hi>Gaules</hi> whom <hi>Attalus</hi> had drawne out of <hi>Europe</hi> into <hi>Asia</hi> for the
Warre of <hi>Acheus,</hi> had abandoned him for the causes aboue mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
they spoil'd all the Townes of <hi>Hellespont</hi> with too much auarice and
cruelty. And when in the end they had besieged the Townes of the
<hi>Elienses,</hi> then they of <hi>Alexandria</hi> neere vnto <hi>Troade,</hi> performed an
Act worthy of memory: for sending <hi>Themiste</hi> against them with foure

all the <hi>Gaules</hi> from <hi>Troade,</hi> aswell cutting off their Victuals, as disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
their dessignes. The <hi>Gaules</hi> hauing taken the Towne of <hi>Arisbe</hi>

any regard of Age or Sexe, and abandoned the spoile of their Campe
to his Souldiers. By this meanes <hi>Hellesponte</hi> was freed from great feare,
leauing for the future a good example to <hi>Barbarians,</hi> not to passe so

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Declaration hath beene easie, by the
which the Actions past are related, and the

the frequent increase of the <hi>Grecians</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weales,
and how againe they haue
many times felt a totall alteration. Wee
may without any trouble deliuer things
knowne, and easily coniecture of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
by the precedent. In regard of the
<hi>Romans,</hi> it is difficult to iudge of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
for the variety of their Gouernment: Or to fore-tell the future,
for the ignorance of the Actions, which (as proper to that Nation)
haue beene in old time decided in publique and in priuate. VVherfore
if any one will exactly know the diuersities, he had need of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
iudgement and consideration of Actions. It is true, that they
which by instruction would make vs know things, propound three kinds
of Gouernment: Calling the first a Royalty, the second Aristocracia,
and the third Democracia.<note place="margin">A diuision of Gouernment.</note> Yet in my opinion wee may with reason
doubt of these things, whither they propound them vnto vs soly, or
better then the other: For it seemes they are ignorant of eyther. It
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:16537:149"/>
is apparent that, that Gouernment should be held the best, which is
composed of all the afore-sayd properties; whereof wee haue made
proofe not only by reasons, but also in effect: For that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> hath
first established the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> Common-wealth in that manner.
Neither must we thinke that these Gouernments are alone: For wee
haue seene some Monarchiall and Tyrrannous, who although they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
much from a Royall, yet they seeme to haue something common
with them: the which our Monarches imagine, vsurping with all their
power the name of King. Moreouer the Olygarchicall Common-weales,
which haue beene in great number, seeme to haue some cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency
with the Aristocraticall; although they differ much. The
like we must iudge of a Democracy. And to prooue it true, it will be
apparent hereby.</p>
            <p>We must not hold a Monarchy for a Raigne: but onely that which is
voluntary,<note place="margin">A true Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</note> and gouerned more by a Common consent then by feare
and violence. Neither must we hold euery Olygarchy for Aristocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
but that only which according to the Election is mannaged by the
wifest and best men,<note place="margin">A true Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy.</note> neither must that be allowed for a <hi>Democracy,</hi>
where as all the Commons haue power to do what they wil and please<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
but where as the auncient custome and vse is to honour the Gods, to do
good vnto their Parents, to reuerence old men, and to obey the Lawes.
Then they will call a Common-weale Democraticall,<note place="margin">A Democracy.</note> when as the
Commons shall accept of that which many allow of. Wherefore we
must say that there are sixe kinds of Gouernments: We haue already
spoken of three Common to all the World: The other three are neere
vnto them,<note place="margin">Sixe kinds of Gouernments.</note> that is to say a Monarchy, Olygarchy, and Ochlocracy.
The first whereof is a Monarchy, rising naturally without any esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment.
From whence doth grow a Royall Gouernment,<note place="margin">A Monarchical Gouernment of one alone by feare.</note> by order
and good direction. But when the Royall changeth into its neighbour
vices, as into Tyranny, then by the abollishing thereof an Aristocracy
takes its being: the which naturally changeth into Olygarchia. And
when the Commons reuenge with fury the Gouernours iniustice, then
growes a Democracia. For the outrages and iniquities whereof, in
time it prooues an Ochlocracia.</p>
            <p>A man may vnderstand that these things plainly which I haue sayd,
are true,<note place="margin">Ochlocracia is a Gouernment of the mutiny of the people.</note> if he knowes the beginning and the change of euery Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
according to the course of Nature. For whosoeuer shall consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
either of them a part, and how they grow, may also iudge of their
increase, force, and alteration; and when and how the one ends in the
other. I haue beene of opinion that this kinde of Disputation and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
agreed well with the <hi>Roman</hi> Gouernment: For that by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
course of Nature, it hath taken from the beginning its institution
and increase. Peraduenture these alterations and changes of Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from the one to the other, are more exactly handled by <hi>Plato,</hi> and
some other Phylosophers. But for that they are disputed by them in
many and diuers manners, it happens that few men vnderstand them,
Wherefore wee will indeauour to comprehend them, and set them
downe by certaine Articles, so as (according to our opinion) they may
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:16537:150"/>
be of consequence for the profite of the History, and all mens vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
And if there be found for the present some defect in regard
of the generall and Vniuersall declaration, the reasons which shalbe
hereafter deliuered in perticular, will repaire it. What Principles
then shall I assigne for gouernment? From whence shall I say they take
their first growth and being? When mortallity fell vpon mankind by
inundation of Waters,<note place="margin">The beginning of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> or by pestifferous Calamities, or by barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Land, or by other such like causes (as we haue vnderstood
hath beene, and in reason may often be hereafter) all Institutions and
Artes were then lost: And when againe the multitude of men hath by
succession of time taken increase, as it were from some remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of seede; and that in regard of the weaknesse of their Natures they
gathered together, euen as of Custome (as it is reasonable) other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
doe according to their kinds, it is then necessary that he obtaine
the Principallity and Empire which is of greatest force of body, and
of most vnderstanding. The which wee see happen in other kindes of
bruite Beasts, (which we must hold for a most certaine worke of nature)
among the which wee see the strongest and of most spirit march before,
as Buls, Stags, Cockes, and such like.</p>
            <p>It is therefore likely that a principallity is of that kind, and that the
course of mens liues is so gouerned, assembling together after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Beasts, and following those which are the most strong and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull,
to whom force is the end of their Principallity,<note place="margin">Principallity or Monarchy.</note> which wee
may with reason call Monarchy. But when as with Time there grows
from these Assemblies a Company and Custome,<note place="margin">A Royalty.</note> then a Royalty takes
her Birth: And then Men beginne to thinke of Honesty and Iustice, and
of their contraries: Such is the manner of the beginning and fountaine
of the sayd Gouernments. As all men haue a desire of a mutuall and
naturall Coniunction, and that from thence proceedes the generation
of Children, it is manifest that when any one of those which hath
beene bred and brought vp, doth not acknowledge nor yeild the like
to those which haue bred them, but contrariwise presume to do them
outrage in word or deede, then they which are present are offended:
as knowing their care, trouble, and paines which haue ingendred them,
and with what diligence they haue bred vp their Children. For as
Mankinde is more excellent then all other Creatures, to whom is giuen
vnderstanding and Reason, it is not fit to passe ouer the said disorder,
after the manner of other Creatures: And that contrariwise the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
ought to obserue and reprehend such an Action; foreseeing the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and making their account that the like may happen vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, if at any time hee which hath receiued comfort and aide
from any one in his Aduersity, doth not acknowledge his Benefactor,
but seekes to preiudice him in any sort, it is manifest that they which
shall see it, will be grieued and discontented: So as their Neighbour
shall mooue them to pitty, thinking of themselues as of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
Wherefore then doth rise a certaine thought of Vertue, and a
consideration of the duty which euery man must obserue, which is the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:16537:150"/>
beginning and end of Iustice. In like manner if any one amongst the
rest takes reuenge vppon the most furious Beasts, withstanding their
force, it is reasonable that such a one, should purchase among the people
an acknowledgment of affection and Commaund: And he that should
doe the contrary should both wrong his honour and good reputation.
Whence againe the consideration of infamy and honesty, and of their
difference takes it birth: Whereof the one merrits (as commodious
and profitable) to be loued and followed, and the other to bee shunn'd
and auoided. When as any one hauing the principallity and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
power, vseth the afore-sayd things by the aduice of many, and
that hee seemed to impart them to the Subiects, according vnto euery
mans merite: Then fearing no more any violence, and hauing a good
opinion of him, they submit themselues voluntary vnto his obedience,
and defend his Gouernment: And if hee prooues in all respects worthy
of honour, with one accord they take reuenge and fight against those
which are Enemies to his power.</p>
            <p>By this meanes by little and little, he makes himselfe King of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
when as reason succeedes in the Empire, in steed of rage and
force. This is the first Contemplation for men, according vnto nature
of Honesty and Iustice, and of their contraries; it is the true begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and fountaine of a Royalty. They doe not onely maintaine their
Principallity and gouernment, but many times leaue it to their poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
hoping that their Children bred vp vnder such men will be of the
same will and disposition. But if it happens at any time that the poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of former Kings displeaseth them, then they make an Election of
Princes and Kings, without any respect of corporall forces, ayming
onely at the differences of iudgement and reason, making tryall of the
diuersity of both by the workes themselues.</p>
            <p>Wherefore leauing the ancient custome, they which haue once seazed
vpon the Crowne, and haue gotten this power, they fortifie certaine
places with walls, and possesse the Countrey as well for the safety, as to
supply their Subiects necessities abundantly. Whilest that Kings were
carefull of these things, they were free from slaunder and enuy: For
that they differed not much from others in their Apparrell or Diet, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing
a course of life conformable to others, with a conuersation and
familiarity common to many. But when as they (who by succession
and a prerogatiue of race, are come vnto the gouernment) haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
the preparations which serue for safety, and those which are more
then necessary for foode: then following their appetites, by reason of
the great abundance of all things, they thinke it fitting for Princes to
bee more richly attired then their Subiects, and to be intreated more
de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>icately with diuersity of meates, and to conuerse without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
with other women then their owne. Hence springs enuy and
scandall with hatred and implacable rage: Finally the royalty changeth
into Tyranny.</p>
            <p>The beginning of this ruine, and the conspiracy which is made against
Princes,<note place="margin">Tyranny.</note> growes not from the wicked, but is practised by the best
and most resolute men, who cannot endure such outrages and insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies

of Princes. And withall the Commons hauing found a head to
make resistance, ioyne with him for the afore-said causes against their
Prince: and then the former of a Royalty and a Monarchy is wholly
ruined, so as by consequence an Aristocracia must take its beginning and
sourse.<note place="margin">Aristocracia.</note> Then the people as it were by a thankefull acknowledgment,
ordaine these suppressors of Tyrants to be their Heads and Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and they submit themselues vnto them. When as they haue with
good zeale imbraced the charge of this gouernment, they haue nothing
in so great recommendation, as that which concernes the publique
good: prouiding with great care and diligence for any thing that may
touch the peoples profit, as well priuate as publique. But when the
Children enioy the same power from their Fathers, and haue not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of aduersities, nor of the equality and politique liberty, being
withall bred vp from their youth in the authority and prerogatiue of
their Fathers, they change an Aristocracy into Olygarchia, some aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
themselues to a vitious and insatiable desire of couerousnesse and
getting:<note place="margin">Olygarchia.</note> Others to drunkennesse, and by consequence to excesse in Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets:
some to Adulteries, and forcing of Boyes: Finally, hauing done
vnto the people that which wee haue formerly spoken of, it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
they should conceiue the like ruine in the end that did befall the
Tyrants.</p>
            <p>Beleeue me, if any one obserues the enuy and hatred which the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
beare them, or dare say or doe any thing against the chiefe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
he shall presently haue all the people ready to giue him aide
and assistance in his Enterprize. And when they haue murthered those,
they dare not choose a new King, fearing the iniustice of the former,
neither dare they trust their Common-weale in the gouernment of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
the memory being yet so fresh of the basenesse of the precedent:
so as their onely hope resting in themselues, they retire, changing the
Olygarchicall gouernment into a Democracia, and taking vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues<note place="margin">Democracia,</note>
the care and charge of the Common-weale. It is true that in
the meane time some of those haue escaped, which had tasted of the
preheminence and power: who taking delight and pleasure in the
present estate of the Common-weale, make great esteeme of equality
and liberty.</p>
            <p>But when as young men succeed, and that the Democracia is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
to posterity, (they striue in making little accompt of equality and
liberty) to be greater then the rest: whereinto they chiefly fall which
haue great wealth. When as they affect command, and cannot attaine
vnto it of themselues, they begin to dispose of their riches, and to
corrupt the Commons with that baite. A great number being corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by their bounty, by reason of a silly Couetousnesse of presents, then
a Democracia is ruined and changed into violence, and a seditious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
of policy. For the Commons hauing beene accustomed to liue
by the goods of their Neighbours, make a mutiny, taking a resolute
and audacious man to be their Head, who for his pouerty cannot in
reason aspire to the honours of the Common-weale, and then they
assemble together, and fall to murthers and ruines, and to spoile and
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:16537:151"/>
diuide the Land amongst them, vntill their fury being pacified, they
finde againe a new Lord and Monarch. Behold the reuolution of
Gouernments, and the prouidence of Nature, according vnto which
the estate of the Common-Wealth, changeth and re-changeth, and
makes the same returne. Which things if any one knowes not plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
hee will be ignorant of the time in fore-telling the future Estate of
the Common. But he will erre often, for that a Gouernement in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth
and decreaseth where into it is so transferr'd, if without great
iudgement he giues his aduice. We will likewise come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Institution, increase, and vigour, and likewise of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
change of things in the <hi>Roman</hi> Common-Wealth, according to
this knowledge.</p>
            <p>And if it happen that any other Gouernment hath (as wee haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
sayd) from its beginning this Institution and increase, by the
course of Nature it wilbe changed into its contrary: The which may
be well obserued by that which followes. Wee will deliuer in few
words the <hi>Nemothesia</hi> of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> which shall not be impertinent to
our Discourse. Wherefore when he had considered all decent things,
and how they are necessarily perfect by a certaine Nature, he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
obserued how euery forme of Gouernment is variable, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
simply according vnto a power, so as suddainly it degenerates
into its neighbour Vice, and consequently by Nature. For as rust con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes
Iron, and wormes Wood, being naturall vnto them, so as although
they can preserue themselues from all exteriour outrages, yet they are
corrupted by these, as borne with them: So as according to Nature
there is a certaine mallice growing and adhering vnto euery Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth:
As to a Royalty there is a Monarchy:<note place="margin">Chirocracia a Gouernment by the mut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>To an Aristocracy an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygarchia;</hi>
and to a Democracia, a Chirocracia: So as it must needes
follow, that in succession of time all the fore-sayd change by the said
meanes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lycurgus</hi> hauing fore-seene these things, hath ordained a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
which was neither simple, nor vnder the absolute power of
one man: vniting all the Vertues and properties of the most commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Gouernments, to the end that nothing in it should take a greater
increase then was needfull; nor degenerate into the neerest vice: And
that their forces by a mutuall restraint should not bend or decline to
any part, nor any thing therein ruined: Finally, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale
should remaine of an equall weight for euer, according to
reason and equallity, and that by this meanes Loyalty should be restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from Arrogancy, by the feare of the people, for that a iust por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Common-weale was allotted vnto them. And againe, the
Commons durst not disdaine the Kings, for the respect of the most aged:
Who being chosen by the Grauest, addicted themselues continually
to equity: So as the weakest party was maintained in its Customes,
and was strong and to be feared by the Succour and aide of the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.
The Common-weale being thus established, he hath preserued
the liberty of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> longer then hath come to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
When he had fore-seene the Fountaine and sourse of all of them;
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:16537:152"/>
and what did vsually happen, he established the sayd Common-wealth
with out danger.</p>
            <p>In regard of the <hi>Romans,</hi> they haue done the like in the Institution
of their Common-wealth,<note place="margin">The <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </note> not by one reason, but as choosing that
which seemed best vnto them, being made wise by the euent of things,
by many Combats and alterations: And by this meanes they haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
vnto the same ende which <hi>Lycurgus</hi> prescribed: setling a better
forme of a Common-wealth then wee haue in <hi>Greece.</hi> Finally, hee
that will iudge of Writers with reason, doeth not iudge of matters as
they are omitted, but according to those which are mentioned. And
if he finds any thing false, he must conceiue that omission hath beene by
ignorance: but if all which they haue spoken be true, let him then grant
that what they haue omitted, hath beene done for some cause, and
not through ignorance.</p>
            <p>These three parts, (whereof wee haue formerly spoken,) rul'd in
that Common-wealth. They were all established and ordered so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually,
and proportionably by them, as no man, no not the inhabitants
themselues, could euer say whether this Common-weale were Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craticall,
Democraticall, or Monarchicall. The which hath not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
without reason: For if wee obserue the power of the Consuls, it
appeareth plainly to bee Monarchicall and Royall: and if that of the
S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nators, it seemes to bee Aristocraticall: But if wee duly consider
the popular power which consists in many, it is apparently Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craticall.
In like manner, no man can say by what part the forme
of the Common-Wealth was then guided and gouerned, except in
some things.</p>
            <p>The Consuls being present at <hi>Rome,</hi> haue the Gouernement of all
the publique Affaires,<note place="margin">The Office of the Consuls.</note> before they draw the Army to fielde. To
whom all the other Princes obey and are subiect, (except the Tribunes
of the people) appointing Lieutenants in the Senate, from whom they
demaund aduice in pressing Affaires: moreouer they haue the Charge
and power to make Edicts. Finally, they haue the care of all that
which concernes the publique Affaires, which the Commons are to
decide. It is their duty to call the people together, and to pronounce
their Edicts, and to iudge of the plurality of Voices. Finally, they
haue the power and Authority to prepare for Warre, and generally
of all the Gouernement which is vnder the Heauens, to conclude,
they haue in a manner a most stately and Royall authority. It is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for them to dispose of their Allies in what they shall thinke fitting
for matters of Warre. To appoint and ordaine Captaines of Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands,
to leuy an Army, and to choose the most able and sufficient.
It is also in their power to punish all their Subiects wheresoeuer they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine:
and to dispose of the publique Treasure as they shall think good,
being to that end followed by the Questor: who presently obeyes their
Commaundment: So as he which shall consider this part of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale,
hee will say with reason that it is Monarchicall and most
Royall.</p>
            <p>Finally, if it happen that any of things which wee haue spoken, or
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:16537:152"/>
shall speake, shall change presently or hereafter, they may not in any
sort derogate from our opinion. Next after, the Senate hath the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-sight
of the publique Treasure: For they may dispose of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenewes
and Expences.<note place="margin">The duty of the Senate.</note> It is not in the power of the Questors to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
mony, no not in perticular Affaires, without their order, but for
the Consuls. Finally, the greatest and heauiest expence, as that which
many times the Questors are accustomed to imploy, at the returne of
the Quinquinall, or space of fiue yeares for the repairing of publique
Buildings, the Senate decrees: And whatsoeuer is allowed the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
depends thereon. Of all offences committed throughout <hi>Italy</hi>
which deserue a publique punishment, as Treason, Conspiracy, Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning,
and Murthers by secret practises, the punishment belongs vnto
the Senate.</p>
            <p>And moreouer if any priuate person, or any Citty hath neede of
thankes or blame, or of succours and assistants, the Senate hath the
whole charge. Finally, if they bee to send an Embassie into any part
out of <hi>Italy;</hi> to reconcile some, or to admonish them, be it to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
any thing, or to declare Warre, the Senate hath the power. In
like manner when as Embassadours come to <hi>Rome,</hi> the Senate giues or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for their entertainment, and what answere shalbe made. Finally,
the Commons haue no hand in all that which wee haue sayd: So as
whatsoeuer thou shalt see done in the absence of the Consull, will
seeme to bee an Aristocraticall gouernment: The which many <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and Kings imagine, for that in a manner all their affaires are vnder the
Authority of the Senate, without any contradiction whatsoeuer. For
this cause some one will demaund with reason, what portion of the
Common-weale remaines to the people? Seeing that the Senate hath
the Gouernment of things, which wee haue deliuered in perticular,
and that it disposeth (which is much more) of the Reuenewes and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
expences: And that moreouer the Consuls making Warre with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Citty, haue a Royall power ouer the preparations, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
affaires which are in the Campe. And yet there is a part reserued
for the people, the which is of greater esteeme.<note place="margin">The authority of the people.</note> For they haue the
authority of honours and punishments: wherein is contained the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and gouernment, and finally the generall life of men.</p>
            <p>Beleeue me, there is nothing that concernes the Subiects, that can be
ordered by reason, by such as haue not the knowledge of this difference,
or hauing it doe abuse it. What reason were there that the Wicked
should be equall in Honour with the Good? The people therefore
iudge and many times diuersly, when as the iniustice which they are
to punish is of great consequence, and namely in those which haue
had great and Honourable charges. They alone condemne to death:
Wherein there are some actions past worthy of praise and memory:
For vsually they suffer those that are accused of a Capitall or hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
crime, to retire in the sight of all the World, although there
remaine an opinion in some which confirmes the iudgement and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
by the which a free and Voluntary Banishment is taken quite
away.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:16537:153"/>
Fugitiues are in safety in the Townes of <hi>Naples,</hi>

               <hi>Preneste, Tiuoly,</hi>
and in other Confederates. Finally, the people giue Principalities to
the most sufficient: which in a Common-wealth is a goodly reward of
honesty. They haue also Authority to confirme the Lawes: and Peace
and Warre lies in their will: Iudging of the Succours, Reconcilliation,
and Accords of their Allies. Finally, the people confirme these things
in approouing or disannulling them: So as now some may iustly say,
that the greatest part of the Common-weale is in the peoples hands,
and that it is Democraticall.</p>
            <p>We haue deliuered how the diuers formes of Common-weales,<note place="margin">The mutuall knitting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of three Common-weales.</note> are
diuided among them: Wee must now shew how they may assist and
giue comfort one vnto another. When the Consull hath receiued his
power, and drawne an Army to Field, hee seemes a King, yet hee
hath neede of the people and Senate, to bring his resolutions to an end,
without the which hee cannot possibly finish his Affaires. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
that hee hath neede to furnish and prouide Victualls, pay, and
munition for the Armies. But it is not possible to furnish him with
Corne, Apparrell, nor pay, without the will of the Senate: So as the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of the Consulls are of necessity made fruitlesse, if the Senate
doth willingly faile him or hinder him.</p>
            <p>By this meanes it is in the resolution of the Senate to make the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes
of the Commaunders effectuall or not. It is also in their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to send another Commaunder when the yeare is past, or continue
his Authority that doth enioy it. Moreouer the Senate may make
his Exploits seeme great and admirable, and augment and increase his
Actions, in like manner they may blemish and disgrace them. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of that which they call Triumphes, by the which a certaine visible
shewe of their Actions is brought by the Consulls to the view of the
people, they dare not attempt them, as it is fitting, neyther (to speake
plainly) bring them to an end, vnlesse the Senate allow of them, and
furnish the charge. The consent of the people is wonderfull necessary,
be they neuer so farre off, for it rests in them, (as were haue formerly
sayd) to confirme or disannull all Accords and Leagues. But behold
another case: For after their Gouernement is ended, they are forced
to yeild and submit their actions vnto the iudgement of the Common
people, so as they ought not to bee carelesse of the loue and good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Senate and vulgar sort.</p>
            <p>Although the power of the Senate be very great, yet they must of
force haue respect vnto the multitude of publique affaires, and drawe
them to their ends and intentions: Neyther can they put generall and
great doubts in Execution, nor punish crimes committed against the
Common-weale, if what the Court ordaynes bee not confirmed by
the Common people. Matters which concerne the Senate it selfe, are
of the same condition. For if any one propounds a Law, by the
which it doeth in any sort abridge the Authority and power of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
or ouer-throwes their Prerogatiue and Honour, or pursues them
in their liues, all these things are to bee done by the power of the
people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:16537:153"/>
It is likewise certaine that the Senate cannot execute any of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions,
not hold a Councell, nor assemble themselues, if any one
Tribune of the Commons opposeth. The Tribunes must alwaies doe
according to the opinion of the people, and obserue their will. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of these things the Senate feares the people, and obserues them:
In like manner the people are bound vnto the Senate, and forced to
winne them: For as there are many Farmes which the Censors dispose
of throughout all <hi>Italy,</hi> for the great multitude of publique repairati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and many places of Riuers, Pooles, Gardens, and Mines, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
all other things of that nature, which are vnder the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire:
they are all mannaged by the people, hiring all the Rents and profits
which grow thereby.</p>
            <p>Some take their Leases from the Censors, to whom others associate
themselues, others become suerties for the Farmers: and some bring
the Inuentory of the goods into the Treasury. Of all which things the
Senate hath the knowledge For it rests in them to prolong the Terme,
and to graunt some abatement, if there hath beene any losse: Finally,
to remit the whole Debt, if there hath happened any impossibility.
There are infinite cases wherein the Senate may helpe, or hurt, but
those much, which hire the publique Rents, whereof the Senate hath
the charge. They also name the Iudges in most of their Conuentions
as well publique as priuate, as farre as the greatnesse of the cause shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
Wherefore relying vpon their wisdome, and fearing the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of their aaffaires, they carefully obserue the instances and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
of the Senates aduice. They doe not willingly oppose against
the attempts of the Consuls: For that all in generall (wheresoeuer the
<hi>Roman,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mpire doth extend) are vnder their Command, as well in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
as in publique. As therefore the power of either of these is such,
as they may mutually bring profit or preiudice, yet they are so fitly v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
against all crosses and disasters, as we cannot finde a better forme
of a Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>For when as any common terrour shall present it selfe, and that they
are forced to succor one another the forces of this Commonwealth are
so great, as there is not any thing wanting, neither doth any man faile,
in his Charge, but all tend ioyntly to bring to a good end that which
hath beene resolued: and that whatsoeuer hath beene ordained, may
not be delayed beyond the opportunity of time. Finally, all imploy
themselues as well in publique as in priuate to finish the Enterprize.
Wherefore they haue this peculiar vnto them, that their force is vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistable,
and they accomplish whatsoeuer they resolue. Againe, if
(freed from the publique feare of Strangers) they abandon themselues
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of their good fortunes, then vsually they grow insolent and proud, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured
by flatteries, and giuen to delights and idlenesse. Then may they
easily see how the Common-wealth studies to helpe it selfe: For when
as any one of the parts will be Mistresse, and rule more then is fitting, it

When the diuision of the Tribunes hath beene thus made, so as

their leuie accordingly, they send them hauing taken an Oath, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
them a Commander and a Treasurer. But when the Tribunes at
<hi>Rome</hi> haue taken the Oath of the Souldiers, they send them backe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
a day and a place to euery Legion when they ought to come
without Armes.<note place="margin">The diulsion of Souldiers in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Legion.</note> When they are drawne together on the day appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
they make choice of the youngest amongst them, and weakest
in their estates, to carry Iauelings or Darts: Then such as are more
aduanced in yeares, they carry Armes which they call forked Darts
or Iauelings: And they which are strong of Body and more aged,
are made principals: But the Triarij are chosen out of the most anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.
So many differences of Names and Ages are among the <hi>Romans,</hi>
and likewise of Armes in euery Legion. They diuide them in such sort,
as the Triarij are the most ancient, to the number of sixe hundred: The
principals twelue hundred, to whom the forked Iauelings are equall:
The rest which are younger, are light Iauelings. If the Legion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
of a great number, they diuide it proportionably, except the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arij,
whose number is alwaies the same.</p>
            <p>They youngest are bound to carry a Sword,<note place="margin">The forme of a Buckler.</note> a light Iaueling, and a
Buckler. This Buckler is firme as well for its art, as for the greatnesse,
sufficient to defend the body. It is round, hauing three foote in Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The Souldiers haue moreouer a light Head peece, whereon doth
hang a Wolues skin, or some such thing, which serues for a couering
and marke, to the end that euery one may be knowne by his Captaine
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:16537:155"/>
being in fight,<note place="margin">The light Iaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> doing his duty or not. The light Iaueling is most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
three foote long, of the bignesse of a mans finger, with an Iron
head a good spanne long, and is so slender and sharpe, that vpon the
first cast it must of necessity bend, and so is made vnprofitable to cast
againe: Otherwise they will serue the one as well as the other. Then
they command those which are more aged, whom they call forked
Iauelings to be armed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> Armes are first a Target two foote and a halfe broad,<note place="margin">The forme of a Target.</note> and
bending vpon the superficies, and foure foote in length: The greatest
hath foure fingers more, and is made of two boards glued together with
Oxe-glew: And is couered with a Calues skinne, or that of a Goate, or
some such like Beast. All the circumference hath a hoope of Iron, the
better to beare off the blowes of a Sword, and that leauing it on the
ground, it may not weare. In the midst there is a Bosse of Iron, which
beares off all blowes, and the violence of Stones; of long Pertwisans,
and of all manner of Darts be they neuer so violent. The Sword which
they call Spanish,<note place="margin">The Spanish Sword.</note> and hath two edges with a very sharpe point, hangs
commodiously with the Target vpon his thigh. It chargeth home for
that it is strong and stiffe. Moreouer, they haue two spits, a head-peece
of Brasse, and greaues for the defence of their leggs, amongst
the which spits, some are great, others slender: The strongest which
are long and round, haue three inches in Diameter: Those which are
square, haue the sides equall: The slendrest are like vnto the lesser for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Darts, which they carry with the said Armes: The staffe whereof
doth not much exceede the length of foure foote and a halfe: and they
arme them with a head of Iron, equall in length to the staffe, the which
they ioyne so close with so many ligatures and crosse-nailes, as they
neuer dissolue vntill the Iron breake: although at the neather end it be
a finger and a halfe thicke, where it ioynes vnto the staffe, so carefull
they are in setting them together.</p>
            <p>Besides all these things, they are adorned with a Crowne of feathers,
with three red or blacke feathers standing right vp almost a foote and a
halfe, the which set vpon the top of the head, together with his other
Armes, make a man seeme twice as big, and by this meanes of a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appearance, and terrible to the Enemy. Others taking a peece of
Brasse a span broad, which they lay vpon their stomackes, which they
terme the guard of their hearts, are compleatly armed. But they which
are held to haue aboue a hundred and fifty pounds sterling in their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
take for the defence of their body, with their other Armes, shirts
of maile. The Principals haue the same kind of Armes, and in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the Triarij, but in stead of spits, they carry forked Iauelings. They
choose the heads of Bands our of all these sorts, except the youngest)
to the number of ten, of the most ablest men: Besides the which they
make another Election of ten others, whom they call head of Ordo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
Among the which the first chosen is admitted to Councell.<note place="margin">The manner of choosing the heads of Bands.</note> These
againe choose as many <hi>Lieurents,</hi> These things done, they diuide
with the Captaines euery age into ten parts, except the light Iauelings:
appointing to euery Band two Captaines and two Lieutenants of those
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:16537:155"/>
which haue beene chosen. In regard of the light Iauelings or Darts
which remaine, they distribute them equally throughout all the Bands:
which Bands they haue called Orders, Troupes, and Ensignes: and
their Captaines Centurions and Heads of Bands. These choose out of
euery Troupe two strong and resolute men to carry the Ensignes. They
make two Captaines to euery Troupe, and with reason: For as it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
what either of them can doe or suffer, and that the actions of War
haue no excuse, they will neuer haue the Troupe remaine without a
Commander or Gouernour. If they be both present, the first chosen
leads the right wing of the Troupe, and the second those which are
vpon the left wing of the Ensigne. If one miscarries, he that is present
gouernes all. Finally, they desire not so much valour nor disdaine of
death in their Commanders,<note place="margin">Gouernment, Constancy, and good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell required in a Captaine.</note> as gouernment, constancy, and good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell:
and not to ingage themselues first in the fight, nor to begin it: But
being vanquished and prest, they should stand firme, and rather dye
then to abandon their place. They haue also diuided their Cauallery
into ten Troupes, drawing from euery one of them three Captaines:
who likewise made choise of three Lieutenants, of which the first is
Chiefe of the Troupe, and the rest hold the ranke of Dizeniers or
Commanders of ten, and so they are called. The second holds the place
of the first in his absence.</p>
            <p>The Armes of the Horse-men are at this day very like to those of the
<hi>Grecians.</hi> Formerly they had no Guyrasses, being in danger by reason
of their Linnen breeches,<note place="margin">The <hi>Roman</hi> Cauallery ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med after the <hi>Greeke</hi> manner</note> with the which they were more actiue to
mount on Horsebacke lightly, but they found themselues in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in fight, being in a manner naked. Moreouer, their forked Iauelings
were vnprofitable for two respects: For first they made them slender
and fit to dart, so as they could not take their aime, and many times
they were broken before the point could sticke, for that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
shaken with the trotting of the Horses: and withall they were
of no vse but to thrust forward, being vnarmed at the other end. In
truth they were of no seruice after they were broken. They had also
Targets made of the hydes of Oxen, like vnto puft vp <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>akes, which
they vsually make at Sacrifices: The which they could not well vse in
fight, for that they were not firme, but swel'd with raine. By this
meanes they grew vnprofitable, Wherefore as the vse did not seeme
good, they presently changed, imbracing the fashion of the <hi>Grecians</hi>
Armes, in the which the thrust with a Iaueling is suddaine and certaine,
neither is it without effect, for that it shakes not, but is firme. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
in turning the point behind, the vse is firme and violent: Their Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
is the like, for both in defending and assailing it, it is firme, strong,
and profitable.<note place="margin">The docility of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </note> The which when they had seene, they presently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
it: for the <hi>Romans</hi> are as apt as any others to imbrace the best
course of life. When the Tribunes haue made their diuision, and the
orders concerning Armes, they send them backe to their houses. The
day comming whereon they haue sworne to come to the place appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Consull, (for that euery one doth assigne it apart vnto his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,

hath one certaine length ioyning to the way, being 100. foot long. They
study often to make the depth equall, except vnto the Allies. But if their
Army be greater, they adde both to the length and depth. And as the
lodgings of the Hors-men answere to the middle of the Tribunes Tents,
there is a certaine way made crossing the afore said streight line, and the
void place before the Tribunes. The passages are like vnto streets. For as
of either side the troupes are lodg'd all along, but after the Hors-men of
the said two Legions, they lodg'd the Triarij in the same forme, ioyning
troups to euery Ensigne, so as the figures touch one another, hauuing their
aspect to the other side contrary to the Horse-men, reducing the depth
to halfe the length in euery forme: For that they are most commonly
but halfe so many in number as the other troupes. Wherefore as the
number of men is often found vnequall, it happens that the parts are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
made equall in length, for that they differ in depth. Then they
lodge the Principals 50. foot distant, and opposite to the Triarij. These
being turned against the said spaces, the two streets are compleate, taking
their beginning from the same streight line, with such approaches as the
Horse-men haue, that is to say, of 100. foot distance, which is before the
Tribunes, and ending on the contrary side: The which formerly we haue
propounded to be opposite to all the forme of the Campe. After the
Principals they lodge the forked Iauelings behind in an opposite aspect,
the figures being ioyned. And as by the first diuision all the parties haue
ten Ensignes, so the streets are alike and equall behind, as well in length as
in separation, vpon the sides opposite to the Rampire and Pallisadoe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
where turning the last Ensignes, they campe Then after the forked Iaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
leauing a space of eight fathome and two foot, against them they
lodge the Horse-men of the Allies, taking their beginning at the same
streight line, &amp; ending on the same side. The number of the Allies Foot-men
is equall to the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions, only excepted extraordinaries, but
the Hors-men are double in number, from whom a third part is drawne
for extraordinaries. The Commanders of Bands take the first lodgings
in euery quarter: placing on euery side the sixt Band after the fift, they
retire eight fathome and two foote, the like they doe with the Bands of
Foot-men: so as there is another passage made through the Legions, and
crosse the streets: the which is a way equally distant from the Tribunes
Tents, which they call the fift, for that it is drawne after the fifty fiue
Bands. The place which remaines behinde the Tribunes Tents, and
which of either side ioynes to the Consults Pauillions, serues partly for
the Market-place, and partly for the Questor and his munition. In regard
of the two last Pauillions, of either side of the Tribunes, some choise
Horse-men and other voluntaries following the Campe for the loue of
the Consull are lodged there, towards the sides crossing the Rampiers,
some looking towards the Questors munition, and some to the Market-place,
with an order bending towards the Tents of the extraordinaries.
It often falls out that these men are not onely lodg'd neare the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sull,
but they also doe their duties about him and the Questor,
when the Army marcheth, and in their other affaires.</p>
            <p>To these are ioyned Foot men looking to the Rampire, who doe the
like seruice: after which they leaue a space of 16. Fathome and 4. foote
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:16537:157"/>
broad, equally distant from the Tribunes Tents, besides the Market
place, the Pretorium &amp; the Questory, extending throughout all the parts
of the Rampire: At the vpper end whereof the extraordinary. Hors-men
of the Allies Campe, looking towards the Praetor and Questor. In the
midst of their Pauillions, there is left a way to the Praetors place, of 8. fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thome
and 2. foot, drawing to the further end of the Campe. After these
are lodged the extraordinary Foote-men of the Allies, turning their
backs to them, and looking towards the Rampire and the further end of
the whole Campe. In regard of the void place remaining of either side of
the crossing flanks, it is for strangers &amp; new commers. Matters being thus
disposed, the whole forme of the Campe remaines square with equall
sides. As for particular figures as well of separation of streets, as of other
ordinances, they are much like a Towne. They cast vp the Rampire 33.
fathome and 2. foot from the Tents: for that this voide space profiteth
them much. For it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious for the clensing of the Campe, so as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man goes forth, into that place by the street which is nearest to him
without crossing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> another. There they also keepe their Cattell safely
in the night, &amp; the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ooty which they haue taken from the Enemy. And
it is of great benefit, for if the Enemy assailes them by night, neither Fire
nor Darts can touch them, or very little, and without any offence, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the great distance and the Tents about them. It is then easie for a
man to iudge how spacious this Campe is, whether they giue it a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Foot and Horse, or they make the Legion of foure or fiue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men, with the length, depth, and great number of quarters: adding
thereunto the spaces of waies with all other things. If at any time the
number of the Allies be great, whether that they followed the Campe
from the beginning, or came afterwards vpon some occasion, they fill vp
the places which are about the Pretorium, with such as are new come, &amp;
they draw the market-place and the Questory into one, for the necessity
of the time. Also if the number of those which are come to Field with
the Army be great, they adde on either side of the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions a
streete towards the crossing Flanks. And if all the foure Legions &amp; both
the Consuls be ioyned in one Campe, we must conceiue that they are
two Armies, equally camped and ioyned backe to back, the lodgings of
their extraordinaries touching one another, the figure being somewhat
long, and twice as spacious, with a circumference halfe as big againe. The
Consuls being in one Campe, they doe alwaies thus: But if they be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
they obserue the first order? In regard of the Market-place, the
Pretorium and Questory, they place them in the midst of the two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
But when they are encampt, the Tribunes assemble, taking a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Oath of all men, be they free or bond, who sweare not to steale any
thing in the Campe, and if they finde any thing to bring it to them.
Then they dispose of the Ensignes, and depute out of the two Legions
two of the Principals and of the forked Iauelings, for the guard of the
place which is before them. For thither the greatest part of the <hi>Romans</hi>
repaire daily: and therefore they haue the charge it should bee kept
cleane. Euery Tribune chooses three out of the other two and twenty
Ensignes which remaine. According to the said diuision, there are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ensignes of Principals and forked Iauelings in euery Legion. There
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:16537:157"/>
are sixe Tribunes which gouerne in their turnes, and particularly three
Ensignes, the which set vp the Tent in the place appointed for him that
hath the gouernment, pauing the place which is about it. Moreouer they
haue charge to fortifie if it be needfull, for the guard of the Baggage.
They also appoint two Watches,<note place="margin">The order of two Watches.</note> either of them consisting of foure men
whereof some are before the Tent, and others behind neare vnto the
Horses. As euery Tribune hath three Ensignes, and aboue a hundred men
in either of them, except the Triarij and light Iauelings (which are not
bound to that seruice) the charge is found light: for that the Watch falls
to euery Ensigne but the fourth day. Finally, as for these duties, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Command, with the honour and obedience is due vnto the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes.
The Ensignes of the Triarij are freed from the Tribunes charge,
but they serue daily among the Troupes of Horse men, as they are lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
neare them: and they haue a care of the Horses, lest they should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
and hurt themselues, and so be made vnseruiceable: or being vnti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
fight together, whereby an Alarum might grow in the Campe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Moreouer, one out of euery Ensigne keepes a guard daily before the
Consull, whereby he is in safety from Treason, being the most honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Magistrate. The Allies haue the charge of either side of the Ditch
and Pallisadoe, where euery one of their Troupe is nearest, and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
of the other two, and euery Legion hath one. And as euery flanke
is distributed by the Ensignes, the Captaines of the Bands are present at
the particular guard, but in generall two of the Tribunes had the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight,
who in like manner had the charge of the rest of the Legion. For
For their diuision being made by two, they gouerne by their turnes two
Moneths in sixe, and they (to whom the lot is fallen) haue the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uence
of all the affaires. The same manner of gouernment is obserued
among the Commanders of the Allies. The Horse-men and Captains of
Bands, come at Sun-rising to the Tribunes Tents, and the Tribunes to
the Consull, to whom he giues order for pressing affaires: They likewise
to the horse-men and Captains, who command the Troupe in time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient.
As for the watch word by Night, they giue it safely thus: A
man is chosen both of the Horse and Foot of the tenth Ensigne, which
camps behind vpon the extremity of the streets,<note place="margin">The <hi>Romans</hi> manner in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the word.</note> who is not bound to
watch, but comes only euery day at the Suns setting to the Tribunes Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uillion,
and when he hath receiued the word, (which is written downe)
he returnes, and being come vnto his Ensigne, hee deliuers it with the
word vnto the Commander of the next Ensigne in the presence of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.
The like he doth vnto the next, and so consequently of all the rest
vntill it come vnto the first Ensignes which are lodged neare vnto the
Tribunes. They must bring backe this Paper to the Tribunes before
night: and if all those which haue bin deliuered be returned, they know
that the word hath bin giuen to all in generall, hauing past through them
all. If there be any fault, the Tribune enquires presently of the cause, and
knows by the inscription from what quarter the Paper came, and when
the errour is discouered, they presently condemne him to a certaine
Fine. Moreouer, they appoint their guards after this manner: An En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
watches about the Consuls Tent: the like doe the Deputies of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
Ensigne about the Tribunes and the Troupes of Horse men. Thus
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:16537:158"/>
they of euery Band dispose of themselues, and the Consuls of the other
guards. There are most commonly three guards, one about the Questor,
and two tohers about the Lieutenants and Councellors. But the light
Iauelings remaine without the Campe, making a guard by day about the
Pallisadoe, for it is their charge: Of which there are ten appointed for
the guard of euery Gate.</p>
            <p>The Lieutenant of euery Ensigne brings in the Euening vnto the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune
those that are appointed for the first watch: to either of which the
Tribune giues little Talleys, hauing Characters: After the receipt wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they retire to the places assigned them. Concerning the suruey of the
Watch,<note place="margin">To whom the suruey of the watch belongs.</note> they trust Horse-men; for the chiefe Captaine of the Band must
giue order to one of his Lieutenants to carry this Commandment to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
Legion: That is to say, to foure young men of his Band before din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that the charge belongs to them, to visite the Watch the Night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
This being done, the like command must be giuen to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of the next Band, that it belongs to his charge to make the Round
the day following. This being heard, the day following he doth the like
to othres, and so consequently of the rest: Finally, they which haue bin
chosen by the Lieutenants of the first Band, to whom the Watch is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
repaire vnto the Tribunes, and take in writing what portion, and how
many Watches they are to visite, which done, they remaine in the guard
neare vnto the first Ensigne of the Triarij, of the which the Captaine of
the Band hath the charge, to the end the Trumpet may sound in fit time
for the Watch. The time being come, he that hath the charge to make
the Round, doth it to the first Watch. He not onely visiteth the places
neare the Pallisadoe and streets, but altogether going about the Ensignes
and Troups: and if he finds the Watch of the first guard waking, he takes
their Talley: But if he finds any one sleeping, or the place abandoned, he
departs, taking witnesse of them that are neare. The like also they doe
which afterwards goe the Round. The charge to cause him to sound to
the Watch, belongs to the Captains of Bands of the first Ensignes of the
Triarij of euery Legion, who serue as visiters for the guard. Either of
which in the morning brings the Paper to the Tribune, and if they haue
brought all they returne. If any one brings lesse then the number of the
guards, they search by the Character where the fault was committed.
This being knowne, they call the Captaine of the Band, who brings
those whom they had appointed for the Watch. These debate it with
the Visiter: And if the fault be in the Watch, the Visiter deliuers it
presently with the testimony of those that were neare:<note place="margin">The manner how they pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish such as faile in the Watch.</note> For he is bound
to doe it: But if he hath err'd himselfe, the blame is laid vpon him, and
they make his processe presently before the Tribune, in the presence of
the assembly: if hee be condemn'd, they whip him. This is their
punishment: The Tribune when he hath scarce touch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the condemned
with the rod all the Souldiers of the Campe fall vpon them with rods,
and kill them for the most part, and if any escape, yet they are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued:
for how were it possible, seeing that the returne into their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
is forbidden, neither haue they Friends or Kinsmen that dare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
them into their houses. Wherefore they which fall into this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity,
perish totally. To the like punishmen are also subiect the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:16537:158"/>
and Captaine of the Band, if they haue failed in their Command,
the one as Vissiter, and the other as Captaine of the Band, who must
shew himselfe in time conuenient, wherefore as the punishment is seuere
and irremissible, the watch neuer commits any fault. The Souldiers
must obey the Tribunes, and they the Consuls. It is true the Tribunes
haue power to condemne in a Fine, to absolue and to whip. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
haue the like priuiledge ouer the Allies. If any one hath stollen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing in the Campe, he is whipt: so is a false witnesse, or any one that
is apprehended abusing the flower of the youth. Moreouer, if any one
hath bin thrice reprehended for one and the same crime, they punish him
afterwards grieuously as a depraued person. They hold these crimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
and base in a Souldier, as if any one hath bragg'd falsely to the
Tribune of his prowesse to winne honour: Or if any appointed to the
guard of a place, abandon it cowardly, or leaues any of his Armes for
feare in fight. Wherefore some hauing apparent death before them in
the place where they are set, as being enuironed by a great Troupe, will
neuer abandon the station where they haue bin once appointed, fearing
the punishment due to their offence. Some in the like dangers losing by
chance their Bucklers and Swords, or some other Armes, thrust them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
among their Enemies, hoping to recouer that which they haue lost
by force: or enduring some vnfortunate accident, to flie a manifest infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
and reproach of their Companions. If these things happen to many,
and that some Ensignes haue by a generall consent abandoned their
place, they held it not fit to whip them, nor to kill them all, but they haue
another expedient which is profitable and terrible: for after they haue
drawne the Army together, the Tribunes bring them into the midst of
it, accusing them with big words. Finally, he drawes forth by lot fiue or
eight, sometimes twenty, hauing regard vnto the Troupe, so as there be
the tenth part of the delinquents, whom they whip as hath bin said, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any remission. Moreouer, he commands the rest to lodge without
the Rampiers and Pallisadoes of the Campe, deliuering them Barley for
Wheat. By the apparent danger and feare of the lot equally incident to
them all, seeing the euent is vncertaine, with the example of the Muniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which they giue them of Barley, concernes them all, and serues for a
terrour and restraint from offences. Moreouer, they encourage young
men to vndergoe danger: For when necessity requires it, and that any
one of them hath performed an act of valour, the Consull assembles the
Army, where they are presented which haue done any memorable act:
There he commends euery man in particular, laying open what they
haue valiantly performed,<note place="margin">The manner of recompencing the Souldiers valour.</note> or any other thing that hath bin worthy of
memory, during the whole course of their liues: Finally, he giues a gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Dart to him that hath wounded the Enemy: To a Foot-man which
hath ouerthrowne a Horse-man and stript him, a vessell of Gold: To a
Horse-man the Furniture of a Horse. In former time they had none
but the gaulish Dart: which are gifts which they receiue, which in
skirmishes and such like actions haue done valiantly and couragiously,
where without any necessity they enter voluntarily, and fight
man to man in single Combate, not hee which in Battaile or the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:16537:159"/>
taking of a Towne hath wounded or stript an Enemy. It is true they giue
a Crowne of Gold to those which haue first ascended the wall: The
Consull in like manner makes shew of such as haue defended and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
any Cittizens or Allies, and makes them honourable by gift. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
the Tribunes compell those which haue beene preserued, if they
doe it not willingly, to crowne their preseruer, to whom they beare a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
and respect during their liues, as to their Fathers, to whom they
yeeld the like duty. By these inticements they not onely encourage the
assistants to fight, and by their example to vndergoe danger: but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the Inhabitants which remaine in the City. For they which haue
obtained these gifts, besides the glory and esteeme of the Souldiers, the
fame flying to their family, they haue solemne pomps made for
them, being returned into their Countrey with great honour and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
for that they to whom the Captaines haue done such honours, are
onely worthy to be so magnified and esteemed. They also set vp in the
most apparent places of their Citty the spoiles, as markes and testimonies
of their virtue. As they are thus curious and diligent in the Campe, for
honours and punishment, it is reasonable and fitting the euents of War
should proue prosperous and honourable.</p>
            <p>The Foote-men haue by the day fourteene Deneers, the Captaines of
Bands two Sous and foure,<note place="margin">The pay or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of Foote and Horse.</note> the Horse-men haue three Sous and sixe, a
Foote-man hath monethly almost foure Bushels of Wheate, a Horse-man
hath by the moneth three Septiers and a Mine of Barley and a Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
of Wheate. As for the Allies, the Foote-men haue the same, the
Horse-man hath eight Bushels of Wheate,<note place="margin">A Septier is two Mines, and a Mine two <hi>London</hi> bushels.</note> and two Septiers and a Mine
of Barley, which are things done in fauour to the Allies. The Questor
deducts a certaine portion of the <hi>Romans</hi> pay, for the Wheate, Apparrell,
or Armes, if any of them haue neede. They march in Battaile after
this manner, when the first warning is giuen, they packe vp their Tents
and Baggage. The which no man may take downe, or set vp, before
those of the Tribunes and Consuls be ordred. At the second sound of
the Trumpet,<note place="margin">The order of the Campe in marching.</note> they lay the Baggage vpon the Sumpters. But at the third
the first must march, and all the Campe must moue: whereas sometimes
the extraordinaries march first, being followed by the right wing of the
Allies, with their Baggage in the Reare. After these march the first <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Legion, with their stuffe after them. Then followes the second
with their carriages, following the Army close.</p>
            <p>It is true, the left wing of the Allies makes the Reareward when the
Army marcheth. Sometimes the Horse men follow in the Reare, euery
one to his Quarter: where they are vpon the wings of the Baggage, to
assist them for their safeties. But if there be any doubt of the Reare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
all march in one order, except the extraordinaries of the Allies,
who are brought to the front of the Reareward, and euery other day the
same Legion &amp; wings make the point. Then againe they follow behind,
to the end that all may be partakers of Forrage and water, changing
their order daily, to the end euery one may be first in his turne. They ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
another kind of march in dangerous times, and in a plaine Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne.
They make three Battalions in equall distance, consisting of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:16537:159"/>
forked Iauelings, Principals and Triarij's, putting before the Baggage
of those Ensignes which march first. After the first those that are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond:
and then doth march the Baggage of the third, and they order
their Baggage and Ensignes by this proportion alternatiuely. March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in this order, if there happens any great affaires, they cause the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes
to march thorough the Baggage, sometimes presenting their Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets,
sometimes their Iauelings to the Enemy. And in one instant and
the same march, the Souldiers put themselues in order of Battaile, vnlesse
it be when as your forked Iauelings fetch a compasse: For then the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
with their attendants, stealing behinde the Souldiers, recouers
some place of safety.</p>
            <p>But when in marching they are neare to plant their Campe, the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes
and they which are vsually appointed to that charge, goe before:
who after they haue viewed the place fit for the Campe, they first marke
out the place for the Consuls Tent, (as hath beene said) and vpon what
aspect and flanke of the square thus markt out, the Legions should bee
lodgd. Then they measure out a plot for the Pretorium: after which a
streight line, whereupon are ioyned the Tribunes Pauillions: Then a line
equally distant, after which are lodgd the Legions. In like manner they
measure on the other side of the Pretorium, the places whereof we haue
lately spoken in particular. This is soone done, for that the measures are
easie, the spaces being certaine and ordinary) they set downe a marke,
and first of all that where the Consuls Pauillion must stand: Then the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
on the side which is chosen: The third to the line in the midst, to
the which the Tribunes set their Tents: The fourth where the Legions
are lodgd. Of which these last are red, and the Consuls white. As for
the other side, there they sometimes fasten forked Darts, or other markes
of diuers colours. This done, they consequently make the streets: At
euery one they fasten a forked Dart, to the end that all things might be
knowne more commodiously to them that approach to the Army, and
to the view of the Campe, by a coniecture and consideration of the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
marke.</p>
            <p>Wherefore euery man knowing plainely in what streete and in what
part his Tent is, for that they alwaies hold one place in the Campe. It
falls out in like manner as when an Army enters into its owne Citty,
which is well knowne. Euery man from the Gate turning, marcheth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
and comes to his owne lodging without wandring, for that all in
generall and particular know in what quarter of the City their dwellings
are. It happens likewise in the <hi>Romans</hi> Campe, wherein they seeme (fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
this custome) to take a contrary course to the <hi>Grecians</hi> in regard
thereof. The <hi>Grecians</hi> make great accompt of the strength of a Campe,
and seeke it principally, flying partly the labour of ditching, imagining
that fortifications made by hand, are not so effectuall and good as those
of nature, wherefore they are forced in Camping, wholly to change their
formes according to the scituation on of places: so as all mens lodgings
are vncertaine. In regard of the <hi>Romans,</hi> they desire rather to endure the
labour of rampring, and to doe all other things necessary for their ease,
and to haue the knowledge of euery one in the Campe. These are the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:16537:160"/>
generall parts of the contemplation of an Army, and the scituation of
a Campe.</p>

of the Excellency of these
kinde of Common-weales, as the
<hi>Lacedemonians, Candiots, Mantini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,</hi>
and <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> Some like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
haue mentioned the <hi>Athenians</hi>
and <hi>Thebeins.</hi> For my part, I differ
from the rest: in regard of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi>
and <hi>Thebeins.</hi> I doe not
hold it needfull to vse many words
of them; for that they haue had no
great increase, nor any firme forces,
neither are they fallen into any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
alteration: But as they seemed to be in vigour and force by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
new temporall Fortune, so they haue felt a contrary change. The
<hi>Thebeins</hi> haue purchased an esteeme of virtue among the <hi>Grecians</hi> by
the fault of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Thebeins.</hi>
               </note> and the hatred of those which were
of their League, adding thereunto the excellency of one or two in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the afore-sayd things. That the virtue of Gouernours, and not
the estate of the Common weale hath beene the cause of the <hi>Thebeins</hi>
felicity, the suddaine following Fortune hath made manifest. Their
power hath beene augmented and confirmed, and againe ruined during
the liues of <hi>Epaminundas</hi> and <hi>Pelopidas.</hi> Wherefore we must conceiue
that these Men and not the Common-weale, haue beene the cause that
the Citty of <hi>Thebes</hi> hath purchased so much honour whilest it was in
esteeme. We must likewise for the same reason iudge the like of the
<hi>Athenians:</hi> the which hath many times,<note place="margin">The <hi>Athenians.</hi>
               </note> especially by the virtue of
<hi>Themistocles,</hi> made it selfe glorious, but hath presently tryed a contrary

            <p>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:16537:160"/>
It hath alwaies happened to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> like vnto ships vnfurni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
of Pilots. For when the Company resolue to agree, and to obey
the Gouernour of the ship, either for feare of Enemies, or for the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of a storme, they performe their duties cheerefully. But when
through arrogancy they begin to disdaine their Gouernours, and to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
for that the same things doe not please all men: so as some haue a
will to faile, others to force the Pilot to goe to harbour, and that some
lay hold of the Oares, and call vpon him to set saile: this causeth an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
spectacle to those which behold it, by reason of the mutuall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
and mutiny. The humour of those which are Companions in
the Nauigation, hath no stay: wherefore flying many times the great
depth of the Sea, and great stormes which doe vsually arise, they saile
along the shore. The like hath often happened to the <hi>Athenians.</hi> For
as they haue some times repell'd by the virtue of their people and
Commanders, great and greiuous calamities, yet they haue err'd won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
by their great rashnesse and indiscretion, hauing a prosperous
gale and all things successefull. Wherefore it is not needfull to hold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
longer discourse, neither of it nor of the <hi>Thebeins:</hi> where the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
attempt all things according to their owne humours, the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brutish and rude, and this other accustomed to violence and fury.</p>
            <p>Comming then to that of the <hi>Candyotts,</hi> it is fit to know two things,
why the most learned among the ancient writers, as <hi>Ephorus, Xenophon,
Callisthenes,</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> say first that it is like and the same with that of
the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and secondly that it is commendable: For neither
of them seemes true in my opinion: The which may bee conceiued by
that which followeth, shewing first that it differs; they say that the
<hi>Lacedemonians</hi> haue this proper; that it is not lawfull for one man to
haue more land then another, being necessary for euery Burgesse to haue
an equall portion of lands in the Cittie. Secondly that hee is to bee
amerced as a wicked man, that hath greater possessions then the rest:
By this meanes ambition is wholly or in part rooted out of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale.
Thirdly, their Kings enioy the Crowne for euer: and they
only for life, whom they call ancients: By whom and with whom all
the affaires of the Common-weale are mannaged.<note place="margin">The <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale.</note> In regard of the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diots,</hi>
all the things are gouerned by contrary meanes. For the Lawes
allow them to possesse what Lands they can get: by this meanes Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
is in esteeme amongst them,<note place="margin">The Common weale of <hi>Candy</hi>
               </note> so as the possession of Lands is not
onely held necessary, but also most honest.</p>
            <p>Finally, the desire of infamous and auaritious gaine is so powerfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, that among all mortall men onely the <hi>Candiots</hi> find no
kind of gaine worthy of blame: Although that in that which concernes
their principality, they haue an Annall and Democraticall gouernment:
so as we are in doubt, and wonder often, how Writers haue deliuered
them vnto vs to be familiar and as it were Germaines, seeing they haue
so contrary a Nature: Neither haue they without doting ordained so
many differences, not lightly, but with a great shew of words: saying
that onely <hi>Licurgus</hi> among the Ancients, had aim'd at firme and solid
things: And that as there are two meanes for the preseruation of euery
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:16537:161"/>
Common-weale, which are force against the Enemy, and mutuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
and agreement among themselues: that in chasing auatice, hee
had withall taken away all ciuill discord and mutinie: and that by this
meanes the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> being freed from these mischiefes, haue better
then any other <hi>Grecians</hi> gouerned their Common-weale, and with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vnion. And although the <hi>Candyotts</hi> bee of this aduice parralelling
themselues, Yet they thinke it concernes them nothing, liuing in many
publique mutinies, murthers and ciuill warre by their naturall auarice,
presuming to say that these two Gouernments are alike. <hi>Ephorus</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of these two Common-weales, vseth the like speech, except their
names: If any one doth not obserue the propper names, who can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
whereof hee speakes. These are the causes for the which in my
opinion they differ.</p>
            <p>Wee will now shew the reasons for the which the <hi>Candyotts</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
doth not seeme commendable nor worthy to be immita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
I conceiue that of euery Common-wealth their are two Principles,
for the which their estate and power is desired or detested: Which are
their manner of liuing and their Lawes.<note place="margin">Two principles of euery Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale.</note> That is to bee desired and the
best, by the which the life of men in priuate is made religious and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
and the common course of liuing in the City gracious and iust. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
that is to be detested and auoyded, where they doe the contrary.
And as we iudge confidently that the men of a Common-wealth apply
themselues to virtue, when we see their course of life, and the lawes to
sauour of honesty in some of them: So we may with reason say, that a
Common-weale is altogether depraued, aswell by the lawes, as by their
course of liuing, when we see any giuen to couetousnesse, and the publike
Arts vniust.</p>
            <p>Moreouer you shall not finde any liues in priuate more cunning and
crafty, nor enterprizes more vniust then among the <hi>Candiotts,</hi> except
some few. Whereof we approue it by this comparison, the reason why
we hold their Common-wealth not to be like the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> nor to
be chosen, or worthy to be followed. I say moreouer that <hi>Platoes</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale
is not to be preferr'd. Although that some of our Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
make great esteeme.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Platoes</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale is to be reiected.</note> As we doe not receiue among handicrafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
nor wrestlers, those which haue not excercised their bodies, nor
beene accustomed to wrestling, So we may not receiue this: So as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with the former, we may not bring it in compedition, before wee
see some effects. I will for the present onely propound this: If wee must
esteeme and parralell it to the Common-weales of <hi>Lacedemon, Rome,</hi>
and <hi>Carthage,</hi> it were euen as if a man should propound an Image, to be
compared with men that are liuing and animated. For although he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues
commendation of his Art, yet the comparison of things which
be dead, with the liuing, seeme to the eye poore and obscure. Leauing
them therefore, let vs returne to the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Common-weale.
<hi>Licurgus</hi> without doubt, seemes to haue made the law, and well proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that the Burgesses might agree together, for the preseruation of
<hi>Lacedemon,</hi> and the maintenance of their liberty: So as his considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
seemes more diuine then humane. An equality of possessions, with a
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:16537:161"/>
simple and common course of liuing, should cause a modest life in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate,
and make a City quiet and peaceable. Finally, exercise in labour,
and to indure all toyle, was to make men strong and valiant. Being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that these two which are magnanimity and temperance, concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
together in a priuate person or a City, malice can hardly creepe in
amongst them, or be drawne from their neighbours. By these meanes
the Common-wealth being setled, it hath procured safety to all the
Country of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> and a very durable liberty. But as for that which
concernes the conquest, and principallity ouer their neighbours, and
finally the enterprize of a warre, it seemes he neuer thought of it: but
onely that they should bring in a certaine friendship or resolution, by
the which the common course of liuing of the City, should rest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with their moderate estate, euen as their liues in priuate were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest,
and contented with their choise. And although hee had instituted
in such sort, as they were freed from ambition, and were very wise as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
in priuate as in the common course of their liuing in the City: yet
he hath left them towards the other <hi>Grecians</hi> more then ambitious, and
of an insatiable desire to raigne, with an extreame auarice: So as it is
partly notorious, that first in a manner among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> greedily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
the countries of their neighbours, they made warre against the
<hi>Messeniens,</hi> to draw them into subiection: It is also partly manifest, that
they had obstinately sworne amongst themselues, not to raise the siege,
before they had forc't the City of the <hi>Messeniens.</hi> It is also notorious
that for the great desire they had to rule ouer the <hi>Grecians,</hi> they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
submitted themselues to the yoake of those whom they had van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished
in battaile, So as they had patiently obeyed their commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>They had vanquished the <hi>Persians</hi> making a discent, in fighting for
the preseruation of the <hi>Grecian</hi> liberty: to whom notwithstanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
returned and fled, they haue deliuered the <hi>Greeke</hi> Townes which
were restored, according to the peace made by <hi>Antalcides:</hi> to the end
that hauing money<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they might fortifie themselues against the <hi>Grecians.</hi>
At what time the establishment of their law seemed to decline: for
whilst it gap't after the command of their neighbour, and finally of
<hi>Morea,</hi> they helpt themselues with content, by the meanes which <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemon</hi>
did furnish, hauing necessary preparations speedily, and making
a suddaine returne vnto their houses: But when they began to put an
Army to Sea, and to march out of <hi>Morea</hi> with forces by land, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that their Iron money, nor the trocking of their A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nall fruits, could
not supply their necessities according to the lawes of <hi>Licurgus.</hi> Their
enterprize required currant money, and traffique with strangers for
victuals: so as they were forced to haue recourse vnto the <hi>Percians,</hi> to
impose a tribute vpon the Ilanders, and to exact money from all the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians:</hi>
knowing it impossible (according to the lawes of <hi>Licurgus</hi>)
to hold the principallity of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> nor to bee able to keepe their
owne Common-wealth. But why haue I wandred so farre in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
To the end it may really appeare, that the institution of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi>
lawes, is onely sufficient for euery man to preserue his owne, and
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:16537:162"/>
to maintaine his liberty: And we must confesse to those which respect
a Common-wealth to this end, that there is nothing more to be desired,
then the estate and order of the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> But as any one tends
to greater matters, and thinkes of the command of the Empire, and Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuiy
ouer many, their hope in him and his fauour towards them, to be
more specious and magnificent,<note place="margin">The <hi>Roman</hi> Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-weale more excellent than the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonian.</hi>
               </note> we must then confesse, that the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonian</hi>
Common-wealth is defectiue, and that the <hi>Romans</hi> is more
excellent, and of a more powerfull foundation. The which experience
shews plainely.</p>
            <p>For when the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> laboured to conquer the principality of
the <hi>Grecians,</hi> they suddainly brought their owne liberty into danger:
whereas the <hi>Romans</hi> after they had reduced <hi>Italy</hi> vnder their obedience,
within a short time they subdued the whole world, being sufficiently
supplied with abundance of all things, and prouision of munition and
victuals to effect their Enterprize.<note place="margin">The <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale.</note> In regard of the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> it
seemes to haue beene well instituted since its beginning, according to all
differences. They had Kings, and an Aristocraticall power of Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
The Commons also had their prerogatiue in matters which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
vnto them. Finally, in that which concernes their generall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
it was like vnto that of the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> It is
true, that in the time of <hi>Hannibals</hi> Warre, that of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> was
lesse, and that of the <hi>Romans</hi> better. In euery Common-weale and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
there is a certaine naturall increase and vigour, and consequently a
diminution: so as all things are perfect in their vigour. Moreouer these
Common-weales were at that time different: For the greater the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi>
were in the beginning, hauing had many better fortunes then
the <hi>Romans,</hi> the more they haue beene weakned. In regard of <hi>Rome,</hi>
It flourished then euen in order and policy. And as the people of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi>
tooke great authority vpon them in Councell, so the Senate had
great power among the <hi>Romans.</hi> Wherefore as in publique resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the Commons in the one gaue their aduice,<note place="margin">A Comparison betwixt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weales.</note> and the best men in
the other: so the <hi>Romans</hi> haue beene more excellent in their publique
affaires: where if they haue beene in danger of their whole estate,
yet vsing good Councell, they haue in the end vanquished the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for that which concernes a suddaine preparation to Warre, the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> are more actiue at Sea, and prepare their Fleets better:
For that this practice is hereditary and ancient vnto them, and they
traffique more by Sea then any other men. But as for the Foot-men,
the <hi>Romans</hi> make better vse then the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> for that they wholy
addict themselues vnto it. In regard of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> they are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
of Foot-men: As for Horse-men they take some good order. The
reason is, for that they imploy forreine forces which are Mercenaries:
and the <hi>Romans</hi> their owne Nation and Burgesses. Wherefore this
Common-wealth is more commendable then the other, the which
commits the hope of their liberty to the prowesse of mercenary men:
and the <hi>Romans</hi> to their owne virtue and the succour of the Allies.
Wherefore if at any time the <hi>Romans</hi> haue made losse in their Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:16537:162"/>
they resist with all their forces. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> on the other
side, fighting for their Countrey and Children, cannot abate their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
maintaining the Combate vnto the last gaspe, vntill they haue van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished
the Enemy. Wherefore although the <hi>Romans</hi> be (as I haue said)
inferiour vnto them in Sea-fights, yet they exceed them in the bounty
of their Souldiers. And although that in dangers at Sea, the experience
of nauall combats be of no small importance, yet the prowesse of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
at Sea, is of great profit for the Victory.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Italians</hi> in truth are of a more excellent disposition then the <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niciens</hi>
or <hi>Lybans,</hi> as well in force of body as in courage: whereunto
they vsually incite their Youth. I will tell you one thing which may
serue for a great presumption, of the diligence of this Common-weale,
ordained to breed vp such men as will endure any thing, to the end they
may purchase praise, vertue, and same vnto their Countrey.<note place="margin">The pompe of the <hi>Romans</hi> to an honourable person.</note> If at any
time a man of great fame and note, dies, they bring him with great
pompe to the place which they terms for valiant men, where hee is
sometimes vpon his feete, but seldome laid along. When as all the
people are assembled, if there be any Sonne of his of sufficient age, he
goes into the Chaire of Orations: if not, some other of his Race, who
sets forth the vertue and valour oft he deceased. Hence it growes that
many, not onely of his Companions in valour, but also others being
admonished, and seeing visibly the deeds, haue so great compassion,
as the misfortune seemes not onely proper to those which vndertake
the danger, but common to the people. Finally, after they haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred
him and performed likewise his obsequies, they set his
Image vpon the most apparent place in the house, building about it
a Chappell of Ioyners worke. The proportion of his face is carefully
wrought to the life, according to the forme and lineaments. Which
Images being showne in publique Sacrifices, they adorne honourably.
When a man of some excellent Race is dead, they make his obsequies,
and they being about him which seeme to be of the same height, stature,
and proportion, they put on a garment bordered with purple, if he
had beene a Consull, or Generall of an Army: or else a Roabe of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
if a Censor; Or of cloth of Gold, if he hath triumphed, or done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such like thing. These march in a Chariot in this order: Before the
which goe the bundels of Rods and Maces, and other things accustomed
to honourable persons, according to euery mans authority, with the
which during his life he hath beene honoured in the Common-wealth.
Being come to the place of interment, they are all set in Chaires of Iuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
according to their order: so as a young man that thirsts after glory
and fame, can behold nothing more beautifull. For who would not be
encouraged, to see the Images of men whom they honour in regard of
vertue, and as it were aliue? What other spectacle can wee finde more
beautifull? Moreouer, he that makes the Funerall Oration, begins to
speake of his other Kinsmen there present, and first of all the most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
relating the deeds and imployments of either of them. So as it
falls out that by the Commendation of good men, many times remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
by their vertue, their glory is immortall which haue performed
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:16537:163"/>
any honourable action: and their honour which haue serued their
Countrey well, is made knowne to many, and multiplyed to posterity.
Moreouer, young men are encouraged to that resolution, that they are
ready to endure any thing that presents it selfe for the publique good, to
the end they might purchase the renowne which accompanies good
men. Many <hi>Romans</hi> for this cause haue fought man to man, to get an
estimation among the people: Others haue chosen an apparent death:
some to saue others in Battaile: Others to the end they might procure
a safety in peace to the Common-wealth. Some also hauing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of an Army, haue contrary to all custome and law, slaine their
owne Children, hauing more regard to the good of the Countrey, then
to the naturall alliance of those which were neerest vnto them. They
write diuers other things of many <hi>Romans:</hi> but it shall suffice at this
time to produce one for an example and proofe.</p>
            <p>They report of <hi>Horatius Cocles,</hi> that when he fought against two, right
against the Bridge of <hi>Tiber</hi> before the Citty, and seeing a multitude of
Enemies come to succour them, fearing left they should force the Citty,
he retired to those that were at his backe, crying out vnto them that
they should breake the Bridge, and in the meane time maintained the
sight with great courage and resolution, receiuing many wounds, and
stayed the fury of the Enemies: so as they wondred not so much at his
forces, as at his resolution and courage. When by the breaking of the
Bridge the Enemies enterprize was disappointed, <hi>Cocles</hi> casting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
armed into the Riuer, died according to his resolution, esteeming
more the preseruation of his Countrey, and his future glory, then his
present life, or that which hee had remaining to liue. It is likely that
by such courses young men were inflamed with a desire to honest
actions.</p>
            <p>As for that which concernes gaine, the custome and proceeding of
the <hi>Romans</hi> is much more excellent then that of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> to
whom nothing is infamous that brings profit: where there is nothing
more vile and base among the <hi>Romans,</hi> then to be corrupted with gifts,
and to wrest from another man contrary to duty. The more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
they esteeme a benefit gotten from a great and powerfull man, the
more they blame and condemne as infamous abundance purchased by
vnlawfull meanes. For proofe where of, among the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
they attaine vnto the gouernment which haue openly giuen presents:
whereas among the <hi>Romans</hi> that corruption is punished with death if
it be discouered. Wherefore as the rewards of vertue are contrary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them. It is apparent that the institution of these Common-wealths
is vnequall in these things. Finally, it seemes that concerning
the opinion of the Gods, the <hi>Roman</hi> Common-wealth followes not the
best. And I imagine that all the world holds it a dishonour that this is
found among their actions. I speake of their superstition. It is in truth
preacht among them for so excellent, and so anchored in men, as well
in priuate as publique, as they cannot adde any thing, the which in
truth will seeme admirable. I am of opinion they haue done it for
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon sort. For if the Common-weale could haue assembled wise
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:16537:163"/>
men, this course happily had not beene necessary. But for that the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
is light and inconstant, and subiect to disordred affections, and to
vnreasonable distempers of fury and violence, it was fit to restraine
them by a disguised feare, and by this kind of strange language. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Ancients did not without reason invre the Common sort with
the knowledge of the Gods, and with Tales of Hell, which some at this
day oppose foolishly and without consideration.</p>
            <p>Wherefore in passing ouer with silence other which gouerne Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weales,
if a man lends to <hi>Grecians</hi> but sixe hundred Crownes,
they cannot keepe their Faith, although he hath ten promises, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Signatures, and twice as many Witnesses. In regard of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
in all their Commands, they which mannage great affaires and wealth,
performe their duties according to the Faith of their Oaths: whereas in
other states you shall find few men carefull and sparing of the publique
good, and performing the duty of an honest man: so it is a rare thing
among the <hi>Romans,</hi> to finde any one accused of such a Crime.<note place="margin">All things sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> That
there is corruption and alteration in all things, it is not needefull to
to speake: For the necessity of Nature will giue sufficient proofe. And
as there are two menaes by the which euery Common-wealth is vsually
ouerthrowne, whereof the one is exteriour, and the other of it selfe:
That which is exteriour is in its consideration inconstant: But as for the
order within it selfe, we haue formerly deliuered what kind the first is,
what the second, and how it ends in a third Common-wealth: so as
they which can appropriate the beginning of this present Subiect to
the end, may also fore tell the future: the which in my opinion is
manifest.</p>
            <p>For when a Common-weale hath gotten (after many and great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
auoided) an excellency and vnresistable power, it is apparent, that
growing (as of custome) to abundance of wealth, the expences are
more sumptuous, and men grow more quarrelsome touching Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and other Enterprizes. By the continuance whereof begins a
change to worse, as to ambition which is a kind of ignomy: Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
an arrogant kind of liuing and sumptuousnesse. The people will leaue
this Title of change, when as growne proude with ambition, sweetned
with their good words which seeke to gaine them by couetousnesse. For
then being furious, and mannaging all things with rage, they will no
more obey their Princes, nor be equall to their Gouernours, but most
commonly will haue all the power. This done, the Common-weale will
change its name into a goodly shew of liberty and a Democracia: but
in effect to a most wicked Orchlocracia. Finally, as we haue declared the
establishing, increase, with the vigour and disposition of the Common-wealth,
and the difference from others, and what is good or bad in it,
we will here make an end of this Discourse.</p>
            <p>Resuming then the parts which cohere with the time of the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
from whence wee strayed, we will in few words make a briefe relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of an action: to the end that not onely inspeech, but also in effect, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the manner of a good workeman, we may plainely shew the vigour
and power of the Common-wealth, as it was at that time, propounding
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:16537:164"/>
some excellent action. When as <hi>Hannibal</hi> had won the Battaile of
<hi>Cannes</hi> against the <hi>Romans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibals</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceeding after the Battail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of Cannes.</note> he tooke eight thousand men Prisoners,
which had bin appointed for the guard of the Fort or Campe: suffring
them all to send to their houses for their Ransome and safety. He sent
tonne, of the most apparent to <hi>Rome,</hi> vpon their Faith to returne againe.
Whenas one of them being out of the Fort, was returned, saying that he
had forgotten something, and hauing taken that which he had left, he
went on his way, thinking by this returne to haue kept his Faith, and to
haue made his Oath voide and vnprofitable. When they were come to
<hi>Rome,</hi> they intreate the Senate not to hinder the deliuery of the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and that they would suffer them to pay thirteene Liuers for a
man, and that they might returne safely to their Families. They sayd
that <hi>Hannibal</hi> had so agreed, and that moreouer they were worthy to
be preserued, for that they had not playd the Cowards in the Battaile,
nor done any act vnworthy of the <hi>Roman</hi> name: But being left to guard
the Campe, all the rest being slaine in Battaile, they had beene suddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enuironed and brought vnder the Enemies subiection. But when the
<hi>Romans</hi> (hauing made great losses during the Warres, and being in a
manner abandoned by all their Allies, so as they seemed to be in great
danger for their Countrey) had heard this speech, they were not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
of their honour, to yeeld vnto their misery: neither did they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
any thing that was needfull to be done. But considering <hi>Hannibals</hi>
intention, who thought by this practice to draw away their Treasure,
and withal to dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

couertly that the vanquished had yet some hope remaining and were
so farre from yeelding to that which was required, as they were neither
moued to pitty the Prisoners, nor made any accompt of the future faule
of men: making it knowne (in refusing to redeeme their men) that the
conceit and hope which <hi>Hannibal</hi> had in them was vaine. Finally, they
haue enioyned their Souldiers by a law, to vnquish in fighting or to die,
for that being vanquished there remained no hope of safety. After
which things decreed, they sent backe the nine Embassadours, who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
returned according to their promise, deliuering him who had
thought cunningly to breake his Faith to the Enemy, bound hand and
foote: so as <hi>Hannibal</hi> was not so glad of the Battaile wonne against the
<hi>Romans,</hi> as sorrowfull, wondring at the constancy and magnamity of
these men in their resolutions.</p>

            <p>During these things <hi>Philip</hi> taking the Bowels of the Sacrifices, the
which according to the custome were brought vnto him, and bending
himselfe a little, he presented them to <hi>Arate,</hi> demanding of him what
those Sacrifices signified, and whether they would abandon that Fort
or keepe it still. Then <hi>Demetrius</hi> as the most aged, said: If thou hast the
iudgment of a Soothsayer, we wil leaue it suddainly, but if the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diug
of a warlike King, we will keepe it. And not to abandon it, thou shalt
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:16537:165"/>
consider of another necessary occasion: For by this meanes in laying
hold of the Oxes hornes, thou shalt haue it wholy in thy subiection. By
the hornes he meant <hi>Isthomate,</hi> and the Acrocorinthe: and by the Oxe,
<hi>Morea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then <hi>Philip</hi> returning to <hi>Arate,</hi> art thou of this aduice? And when
as <hi>Arate</hi> spake nothing, he intreated him to deliuer his opinion: who
after he had considered thereon, answered, thou mayst keepe it, if thou
canst prouide in such sort that the accord with the <hi>Atheniens</hi> may not
be infring'd. If in taking it thou puts a Garrison, thou shalt loose all the
Fort, and the Garrison it selfe (meaning his fayth) which thou hast re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
from <hi>Antigonus,</hi> in giuing the Guards to the Allies. Consider
whether it be now better, that in putting me forth, thou loosest this
fidelity, and that by this meanes thou setlest Garrisons ouer the <hi>Messe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niens,</hi>
and other Allies. But <hi>Philip</hi> had a great desire to breake the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord:
the which his following actions made manifest. And when hee
had a little before beene sharpely reprehended by yong <hi>Arate</hi> for the
defeate of some men, and that the elder (hauing spoke freely and with
authority) had intreated him not to giue an easie eare to such speeches
as should be vsed vnto him, shame restrained him: and taking his right
hand, well sayd he, let vs follow the same course.</p>
            <p>In regard of the City of the <hi>Sardins,</hi> there were continually combats
and dangerous encounters. For the souldiers of eyther side studied day
and night to frustrate one anothers pollicies by new inuentions: to write
all which in particular would be no lesse vnprofitable then tedious. And
when as the siege had continued full two yeeres, <hi>Lagoras</hi> of <hi>Candy,</hi> a man
well experienced in the art of warre, hauing considered with himselfe,
that many times strong Cities fall easily into the Enemies hands, by the
negligence of the inhabitants, who relying vpon their fortifications
made as well by nature as art, assure themselues and grow idle: And
knowing likewise how they are accustomed to set guards in strong pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which might make heads against the Enemies attemps: Seeing
likewise according to his conceit the despaire of them all, that they
should not be able to take the <hi>Sardins</hi> Fort by this meanes; and that
want of victuals and munition, remained for their last hope to take it:
The more he considers thereon, and studies by what meanes he might
finde some occasion to surprize the City. And when as afterwards hee
found that the courting of the place,<note place="margin">A signe of the <hi>Sardins</hi> negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</note> which they call <hi>Serie</hi> (it is that
which ioynes the City with the Fort) was without guard, it happened
that according to his hope and opinion, he discouered the negligence
of the guard by his presumption.</p>
            <p>This place was very rough and steepe, hauing a valley neere vnto it,
into the which they of the City cast their dead carrion: Whither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
a great number of vulture and other rauening Birds. When this
man saw that these Birds after they were full gorg'd, pearch daily vpon
the top of the valley, and on the wall, he knew thereby, that of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
this courtine was abandoned, and for the most part without guard.
Then approaching wisely in the night, hee sought meanes to get vp.
And when he found that in a certaine place of the valley they might
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:16537:166"/>
ascend, he aduertised the King. Who conceiuing a good hope, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
<hi>Lagoras</hi> to continue his enterprize, promising to doe what
possibly hee could. <hi>Lagoras</hi> intreats the King, to giue him for
companions <hi>Theodote</hi> the <hi>Etolien,</hi> and <hi>Denis</hi> Captaine of his guard,
and that hee would command them to beare him company to
lay this Ambush: For they seemed to bee able men and sufficient
for this enterprize. And when the King had satisfyed his demand, they
agree together, and by a common consent make choyse of a night, when
as part of the morning had no moone-light. After which the day before
at Sunne-setting, they make choyce of fifteene strong and resolute men,
to mount vp the ladders with them, and to gaine the wall, who in this
hardy enterprize should be their companions.</p>
            <p>Then they chose thirty other, to lye a little distant of in Ambush:
to the end that when they had recouered the wall, they should fall vpon
the next gate, and striue to breake the hinges and ioynts, and the
others within the barres and lockes. They also appoynt two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men in the reare of these, who entring with them should
recouer the place of the Theater: The which was made so conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently,
as it was opposite to the approaches of those of the Forts
and those of the City. Moreouer to auoyd the suspition of the truth,
in regard of the choyse of these men, he gaue order that the <hi>Etoliens</hi>
should giue an assault vnto the City by a certaine valley: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was needfull that these should second them, according to a signe
which should be giuen them. When as all things were ready, and the
Moone growne darke they which were <hi>Lagoras,</hi> taking the ladders,
approacht closely to the top of the valley, and hid themselues vnder the
rocke.</p>
            <p>When at the breake of day they had relieued the watch which was
on that side, and the King had sent (as of custome) others to second
them, and had appoynted a good number for a place where they runne
their horses, no man suspected any thing of the enterprize: But when
as the two ladders were set vp against the wall, where <hi>Denis</hi> on the one,
and <hi>Lagoras</hi> on the other mounted first vnto the top, their grew a great
noyse, and alteration in the Campe. It so fell out that they which moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the ladders, could not be discouered by them of the City, nor by
the rest which were in the Fort vnder <hi>Acheus,</hi> by reason of the Rocke
which aduanced ouer the valley. But their courage which ascended
the wall and assailed the City, was apparant to the Army. Wherefore
some wondred at there incredible resolution, others foreseeing the
future, and fearing, remained partly amazed, and partly ioyfull. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the King seeing the alteration in his Campe, desiring also to diuert
this fancie, as well from his owne men, as from those of the City, he
led forth his Army, and besieged the two Gates, which they call <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,</hi>
On the other side <hi>Acheus,</hi> seeing the Enemies alteration more then
of custome, was in great doubt, being ignorant of the present cause, and
could not vnderstand the practise, Yet he sent men to the Gate, which
succours came somewhat late, for that they descended by straights
and hollow places. <hi>Aribaze</hi> who was Captaine of the City, went
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:16537:166"/>
simply to the Gates, which he had seene <hi>Antiochus</hi> assaile: appoynting
some to goe vnto the wall, others to make sallies by the Gate, to
keepe the Enemy from approaching, and to fight with them. In the
meane time <hi>Lagoras, Theodote,</hi> and <hi>Denis,</hi> with their troupe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
recouered the walls, came to the Gate vnderneath, whereof some
maintayned the charge which the Inhabitants gaue them, others brake
the barres and bolt of the Gates. The like did they without which were
appoynted to that Quarter. When as the gate was opened, the other
two thousand entred the City, and seize vpon the place of the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
This done, all they which had runne to the walls, and to the
Gate which they call <hi>Perside,</hi> who had beene sent by <hi>Aribaze</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it, against the Enemies assault, came running thither. After
which retreate, the Gate was opened, so as some of the Kings
troupe pursuing those which abandoned it, entred pell mell. When
they had taken the Gate by force, some entred the City, others
forced the next Gates. They that were of <hi>Aribazes</hi> band, with
all the Citizens, recouered the Fort by flight, after they had made
some little resistance. After this route, <hi>Legoras</hi> and <hi>Thodotes</hi> band
stood firme in the place of the Theater, seruing as a Fort to all the
rest. Finally the rest of the Army charging of all sides tooke the City.<note place="margin">The Citty of the <hi>Sardins</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by assault.</note>
By this meanes, the City was wholly sackt and ruined, some killing
those they encountred, others setting fire of the houses, and some
gaping after spoyle for their priuate profit. And thus <hi>Antiochus</hi> van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished
the <hi>Sardins.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>O man can iustly say, if they to whom these
kindes of Calamities and disasters haue befalne,
ought to be blamed or censured, or helde wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of pardon and pitty in regard thereof:
For that it falls and happens to many (to whom
all things haue beene done conformable and
agreeable vnto reason) to bee subiect to those
which transgresse with great desire, the things
which are iust and reasonable before men. Yet wee may not be silent
here, being necessary (hauing regard to the time and circumstance of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents)
to blame some Captaines, and to pardon others: The which
will appeare plainly by this. When <hi>Archidamus</hi> King of the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi>
suspected that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> aspired to the Crowne, he fled from
<hi>Lacedemon.</hi> Who soone after being againe perswaded, put himselfe
into his hands. Being therefore by this meanes stript of Crowne and
Life, hee hath left no excuse to posterity, of those things which he
hath suffred. For what colour is there, the cause being still the same,
and <hi>Cleomenes</hi> power increasing, but he should suffer the things which
we haue spoken, hauing put himselfe into their hands, from whom he
formerly had fled, giuing order for his safety contrary to all hope? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that <hi>Pelopidas</hi> of <hi>Thebes</hi> had beene the cause of King <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
iniquity, and that hee knew well, that all Tyrants are capitall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
to those which defend liberty, yet he perswaded <hi>Epaminundas</hi>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:16537:167"/>
to be Gouernour not only of the popular Common-weale of the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beins,</hi>
but also of the <hi>Grecians.</hi> And as he was an Enemy to <hi>Thessaly,</hi>
to the end he might ruine the Monarchy of <hi>Alexander,</hi> yet he presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to go the second time in Embassie vnto him. Wherefore when
he fell into the hands of his Enemies, hee was the cause of great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice
to the <hi>Thebeins,</hi> and the ruine of their glory, which vntill that
time they had preserued: for the confidence he had in those, whom he
should not haue trusted.</p>
            <p>The like hapned to <hi>Cheius</hi> Chiefe of the <hi>Romans,</hi> during the Warre
of <hi>Sycily,</hi> for that he had indiscreetly thrust himselfe into the Enemies
power. Diuers others haue suffered the like. Wherefore they are
worthy of blame, who without great consideration, submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
vnto their Enemies, and not they who (asmuch as in them lies)
mannaged their Affaires discreetly: for in truth no man can gouerne
them well, relying vpon another. If thou dost them by certaine oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
which are conformable to reason, thou shalt be blamelesse.
The most likely causes of this kind are, an Oath, Children, Wife, and
for the most certaine, the fore-passed life. And if it happens that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
colour of these things, thou falst into an inconuenience, the faulte
shall not bee thine in suffering, but theirs who commit the wrong.
Wherefore we must seeke such Arguments and assurances, as in regard
thereof, he in whom you trust, may not breake the faith which hee
hath giuen. But for that there are few such, the best will bee to haue
a care of those which are conformable to reason: so as if wee be decel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
therein, wee may not loose our excuse with strangers: the which
hath hapned to many of our Predecessors.</p>
            <p>It is a thing much more manifest in those times whereof wee haue
made mention, and of a later date, in that which hath befaene <hi>Acheus:</hi>
who fell into his Enemies hands, although hee omitted nothing that
might be done for his safety, prouiding for all things as much as Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
sense could effect. Wherefore the euent hath caused commisse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and pardon, in him which hath suffered with strangers, and
blame and hatred to those which haue done the outrage. Moreouer,
I do not find it strange to my Enterprize and first intention, to aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
the Readers of the greatnesse of these things, and of the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
desire of the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Common-weales. Who
will not hold it fit to be considered, how the Gouernours of such great
Cities, not being ignorant of the things which had happened in <hi>Italy</hi>
and <hi>Spaine,</hi> hauing moreouer of either side an equall hope of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and a present danger of the Warre, haue not beene contented
with this apparent discommodity, but contended for <hi>Sardinia</hi> and
<hi>Sycily,</hi> imbracing the whole, not onely in hope, but with Expences
and Preparations of Warre, which will mooue any man to wonder,
that shall obserue it all in perticular? The <hi>Romans</hi> had two sufficient
Armies in <hi>Italy</hi> with their Consuls for their preseruations: And two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in <hi>Spaine,</hi> where <hi>Gneius</hi> had the leading of that by Land, and
<hi>Publius</hi> of the other by Sea. These are things which happened to the
<hi>Carthaginians.</hi> Moreouer they sent an Army by Sea, to crosse the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:16537:168"/>
of <hi>Philip</hi> in <hi>Greece:</hi> In the which <hi>Marcus Valerius</hi> commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
first, then <hi>Publius Sulpicius,</hi> with whom <hi>Appius</hi> likewise ioyned
with a hundred Quinqueremes. Moreouer <hi>Marcus Claudius</hi> furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
with an Army at Land, had assailed <hi>Sycily:</hi> The like <hi>Amilcar</hi> had
done being sent by the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the which things I am confident, (the which I haue often spoken
in the beginning of this Worke) to find a certaine assurance by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
which consist in this, that it is not possible for those which
Write perticular Histories, to be able to obserue the generall disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of things: For how is it possible, that he which doth barely read
the Exploits of <hi>Sycily</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> can know or conceiue the greatnesse
and continuance of Actions, nor in what sort or forme of a Common-weale,
Fortune hath brought it to an end? The which is very admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to vs, for that all the Countries of the World, which are come
to the knowledge of men, are subiect to one Empire and Power, the
which hath not formerly beene.</p>
            <p>It is true, that it is not impossible to vnderstand in some sort by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Histories, how the <hi>Romans</hi> haue Conquered <hi>Sycily</hi> and <hi>Spaine:</hi>
But it is a difficult thing to know in what sort they haue attained to this
Vniuersall power and Commaund: Nor to what vse perticular Actions
haue serued to their generall Enterprize, nor with what succours, nor
at what time they haue attempted it, without a full and generall Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the proceedings: neither will it be easie for the same causes, to
consider the greatnesse of Actions, nor the power of this Common-weale.
For in that the <hi>Romans</hi> haue Conquered <hi>Sycily</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> and
haue made Warre there both by Sea and Land, it is no wonder if one
man deliuer it in perticular. But if we consider that when these things
hapned, this powerfull Common-wealth had ended many others, and
at the same time, and how it was effected, and with what calamities
and Warre, they were afflicted in their owne Region, which perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
these Exploits at that time, finally their deedes wilbe held glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and admirable; and then the knowledge of these things will square
well. This Discourse shalbee directed vnto those, who by perticular
Commentaries, thinke they are able to attaine vnto the knowledge of a
generall History.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marcus</hi> furnished with an Army of threescore Quinqueremes, sailed
to <hi>Achrandine,</hi> either of which were armed with men, carrying Bowes,
Slings, and Darts to repulse those which should defend the Forts. Hee
had also eight Quinqueremes furnished with Pallisadoes, aswell on the
right as left side: with the which being ioyned together with two thin
inclosures, they approacht vnto the Wall, by meanes of the Pallisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
set without the inclosure,<note place="margin">The order of the Engines of Battery.</note> and they call them Sambuques. The
manner of ordring the same Engines was in this sort. They had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Ship a Ladder of foure foote broad, to the end that at the Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
it might come to the top of the Wall: Vppon the sides thereof
they made stayes, and armed them with a couering for defence, setting
them crosse the inclosures, which kept the Shippes vnited together, so
as they did passe much beyond the Prow or fore-part of the Shippe.
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:16537:168"/>
There were pullies fastned with Cords to the top of the Masts: and
when as necessity required, they drew those which were at the poope
or hinder part by the pulleys, with Cords tyed to the top of the
ladder. The others which were at the Prowe, assured the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
with stayes: and finally they approacht it to the wall, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neare to Land by the nauigation of the ships, which was done by
the meanes of two Pallisadoes which are placed without. On the top
of the ladder there was a planke, which couered three superficies with
<hi>Persian</hi> Targets, to the which foure Souldiers mounted, and fought
against those which from the Forts sought to hinder the approach of
the Sambuques. When by the ioyning of the ladder they haue gained
the wall, in disarming the sides of their Targets, they mount to the Forts
or Towers. The rest follow them by the Sambuques, by meanes of
the transport of the ladder from Vessell to Vessell by ropes. Finally,
this Engine was not vnfitly so called. For being finished and set vp, the
figure of the ship and ladder reduced into one, make it like vnto a Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buque.
They imagined to come close vnto the Wall with this Engine.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Archimides</hi> hauing made prouision of Engines fit for all distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
troubled them at Sea much, and thrust them into despaire, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noying
them a farre off with casting Engines which were strong and
great. But if they went beyond them, he vsed lesser Engines, according
to the distance, which disappointed and hindred their Enterprize and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigation:
vntill that <hi>Marcus</hi> being much perplexed, was forced to make
his approaches couertly in the Night. When they had recouered
Land, and were out of the Battery, he made another kind of Engine
against those which were to fight by Sea. For hee made many holes
in the Wall without, the height of a man, and of the bignesse of a
mans hand, where hee appointed within casters of Darts, and of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
to repulse, making by the meanes thereof the Enemies attempts
in their mounting vnprofitable.</p>
            <p>By this meanes he not onely repuls'd them farre off, and preuented
their attempts neare, but also slew many of them. And whereas they
made vse of their Sambuques, he likewise set vp Engines, to pull them
ouer the Wall: and kept them alwaies hidden vntill necessity required,
setting them vpon the Walles within, to passe forth and fall vpon the
sayle-yards: some of them cast Stones, or Lead of twelue hundred
waight. And when as the Sambuques approach sometimes in turning,
they cast from the top of the Engines with a Tower, Stones against
them as necessity required. So as not onely the Sambuque hath beene
broken, but also the Vessel: and all they that were within it in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
Againe, some Engines cast lesser Stones vpon the Enemy, comming
to the assault couered with Targets, to the end they might not bee
annoyed with the Darts and other Weapons, which they cast from
the Wall, that they which fought in the Prowe might bee repuls'd.
They likewise let downe a hand of Iron tyed to a Chayne, the which
laying hold of him which gouerned the toppe, drew the Prowe
within the Walles with the tayle of the Engine. And if at any
time in raysing the Prowe, hee set the Shippe vppon its Poope,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:16537:169"/>
hee held it firme and vnmoueable by his instrument, then by a
kind of fauour he let slip the hand and the chaine by the Engine. By
this meanes some fell vpon their sides, others were ouerthrowne,
a great part of them (the Prow falling from the top to the bottome)
were drowned with great confusion. <hi>Marcus</hi> discontented with <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mides</hi>
repulses, seeing likewise his men preuented in their attempts,
to his preiudice and disgrace, sayd (although hee were grieued with
his misfortune) in scoffing at the deeds of <hi>Archimides,</hi> that he vsed
his ships as they doe pots, to draw water out of the Sea, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
battred and beaten, they were as disloyall fallen infamously. This
was the eud of the Siege at Sea. In regard of those which were with
<hi>Appius,</hi> they ceased from their attempts, hauing endured the like
affronts and losses. For although they were a good distance from
the Wall, yet they were hurt and slaine with their casting of Stones
and Darts.</p>
            <p>In truth the Art, the number and the effect of all manner of Engines,
whereof King <hi>Hieron</hi> had made good prouision, was admirable, the
which <hi>Archimides</hi> had forg'd and made, being the Architect and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineere.
And when as they approacht the City, some of them (as we
haue sayd) were slaine with their Arrowes, and continually repuls'd
from their app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oaches: Others couered with Targets, and therefore
assailing with greater force, were ouerthrowne, and slaine with Stones
and the bodies of Trees: A good number likewise were slaine by the
hands descending from the Engines as we haue sayd: For they cast
downe men being raised vp on high with their Armes. Wherefore they
of <hi>Appius</hi> Army retiring to their Campe, and holding a Councell with
the Captaines, were all of one opinion, and resolued to try all manner of
hope, to take <hi>Saragosse</hi> by siege: the which in the end they did. For when
they had besieged this City for the space of eight Moneths, they ceased
not daily to make braue and valiant enterprizes of Warre: But they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
durst attempt to take it by force.</p>
            <p>By this meanes a man with good fortune seemed to bring to an end
great and admirable things, when as they are fitly ioyned together in
great affaires. Finally, the <hi>Romans</hi> hauing such great Armies both by
Sea and Land, attended to take the Towne speedily, if they could get
an old man out of <hi>Saragosse,</hi> not daring to approach it, whilst that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimides</hi>
were present and could defend it. Wherefore conceiuing that
<hi>Saragosse</hi> might be taken for want of victuals and munition, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the great multitude which was in the City, they relyed vpon this
hope: and hindred by an Army at Sea that nothing might approach,
and by that at Land, that no succours might come. Moreouer, the
Commanders being loath to spend the time in vaine, during the siege
of <hi>Saragosse,</hi> but withall to vndertake some good thing beside the
siege, they diuided their Army in such sort, as two parts should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
with <hi>Appius</hi> for the siege of the City: And that <hi>Marcus</hi> with
the third part should assaile the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who sent an Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Sicily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, <hi>Philip</hi> hauing made the <hi>Messeniens</hi> his mortall Enemies,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:16537:169"/>
could in nothing offend them that was worthy of fame: Although hee
had assailed their Countrey to torment them, vsing great indignities to
his best Friends.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Philip</hi> causeth <hi>Arate</hi> to be poisoned.</note> For soone after hee caused old <hi>Arate</hi> to bee poiso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in <hi>Messene,</hi> for that hee was discontented with his course of life:
The like hee did to <hi>Taurion,</hi> who had serued him in <hi>Morea.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
these his Actions were presently divulged and made knowne to
strangers. His power ouer those whom hee then defeated was not
new, but long before vsed, and practised by custome: neither was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>
ignorant of this mischiefe, the which was discouered by this
meanes. And as he had concealed it from all others, yet he did not
hide it from <hi>Cephalon</hi> one of his familiar Friends: But declared vnto him
his infirmity, the which appeared by the bloudy spittle against the
wall, saying: Behold <hi>Cephalon,</hi> the recompence wee reape by <hi>Philips</hi>
Friendship.</p>
            <p>Truely, Mediocrity is so great and honest, as hee which suffers, is
more ashamed of the deed, then he that hath committed it. But such
rewards they reape of Friendship, that haue beene Companions in such
great Actions, and done seruice to <hi>Philip.</hi> Finally, <hi>Arate</hi> after his
death receiued sufficient honours,<note place="margin">Honours done to <hi>Arate</hi> after his death.</note> both in his Countrey and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
weale of the <hi>Acheins,</hi> as well for the gouernment which hee had
often in charge, as for the many fauours he did vnto that Nation. They
decreed him Oblations and Heroyicke honours, and finally, all things
which serue to perpetuate the memory: so as if the Dead haue any
sense, it is likely he commends the acknowledgement done vnto him,
and the communication of affliction and dangers which haue happened
in his life time.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Philip</hi> had long deuised how to take <hi>Lisse,</hi> and its Fort, desiring
to reduce those places vnder his obedience, hee drew thither with his
Army. Hauing marcht two dayes, and past the streights, hee campt
neare vnto the Riuer of <hi>Ardaxana,</hi> neare vnto the Citty. And when
he had viewed the scituation of <hi>Lisse,</hi> excellently well fortified both
by nature and industry, as well towards the Sea as Land: And likewise
the Fort ioyning neare vnto it, the which in shew was impregnable to
all the World by force, as well for its extent vpwards, as for the other
fortification, he despaired to take it, yet he did not wholly despaire to
take the Towne. Considering therefore that the space betwixt the
Towne &amp; the Mount of the Fort, was reasonable to besiege the Towne,
he thought good to make a Skirmish there with his Archers, which was
then his manner of proceeding. Suffring then the <hi>Macedovians</hi> to rest a
day, whom he aduertised of things necessary, he layd an Ambush in the
Night of a great part, and the ablest of his men, in certaine woody Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,
and neare vnto a Mediterranian place, lying aboue the place wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we haue spoken: and retaining for the day following those that were
armed with Targets, and the rest of the nimblest Souldiers, hee takes
his way forthwith towards the Citty, marching of either side to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Sea.</p>
            <p>When hee had past beyond it, and had made a stand there, it was
apparent that hee meant to assaile the Citty in that place. As this
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:16537:170"/>
comming of <hi>Philip</hi> was not vnknowne, so a great number out of <hi>Scla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uonia</hi>
were come into <hi>Lisse.</hi> It is true that for the great confidence they
had in the fortification of the Fortresse, they sent but a meane Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Wherefore when the <hi>Macedonians</hi> approacht, the Inhabitants pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
made a sally,<note place="margin">A sally made by them of <hi>Lisse.</hi>
               </note> relying in their multitude and the force of the place.
The King ordred the Targetteers in the plaine, commanding the most
actiue to recouer the hills, and to fight valiantly with the Enemy. The
which they performing, the danger seemed something equall. But in
the end <hi>Philips</hi> men retired, for the difficulty of the place and the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of their Enemies. And as they retired to them that were armed
with Targets, they of the City pursuing them with a kind of disdaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Plaine, fought with the Targetteers. They likewise whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the guard of the Fort, seeing <hi>Philip</hi> retire by little and little with his
Troupes, and imagining that he was going away, came running couete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
trusting in the nature of the place: Then leauing few men within the
Fort, they came by vnknowne wayes into the Plaine, as if they were to
take the spoiles of their flying Enemies.</p>
            <p>But in the meane time they which were in Ambush, rise suddainly
and gaue a furious charge with the Targetteers vpon the Enemies. The
multitude was herewith so amazed, as the <hi>Lissiens</hi> retired for their safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to the City. In regard of those which had abandoned the Fort, their
returne was cut off by the Ambush. Whereby it happened that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as

and by their rough and terrible assaults <hi>Philip</hi> hauing conquered the said
places contrary to his hope, he made all the Neighbours thereabouts
subiect vnto him, so as a great part of <hi>Sclauonia,</hi> offred to submit their
Townes to his protection. It is true, there were no Forts that could
endure the violence of <hi>Philip:</hi> neither any safety for those which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted,

            <p>
               <hi>Bolis</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bolis.</note> was a man borne in <hi>Candy,</hi> who had long frequented the Court,
and was aduanced to the prime dignity. Hee seemed to be very wise
and resolute, with no lesse experience in the Warre. Whom when <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibius</hi>
had gain'd, and made affectionate vnto him, he commanded him
(after a long speech) to put a businesse in execution, telling him, that
there was not any thing at that time, could be more pleasing vnto the
King, then to finde meanes to saue <hi>Acheius.</hi> The which <hi>Bolis</hi> hauing
heard, and promised to consider thereon, he retired. Two or three
dayes after, when he had thought of this Discourse, hee came to <hi>Sosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi>
and vndertooke to effect it: saying, that he had long held the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Sardins,</hi> and had good knowledge of the Countrey: Adding
moreouer, that <hi>Cambyle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Combyle.</note> Captaine of the <hi>Candiots</hi> which are in pay
with <hi>Antiochus,</hi> was not only a Burgesse, but also his kinsman and friend.
It happened that <hi>Cambyle</hi> and the <hi>Candiots</hi> that were vnder his charge,
had the guard of the backpart of the Fortresse, which was not fortifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d,
but it was guarded by a multitude of <hi>Cambyles</hi> Souldiers. When as <hi>Sosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
found this aduice good, studying how hee might free <hi>Acheus</hi>
from calamity, or whether it were better to attempt it by some other
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:16537:170"/>
man then <hi>Bolis,</hi> but his humour concurring with <hi>Bolis,</hi> the businesse
tooke this effect. <hi>Sosibius</hi> deliuered money presently, to the end no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
should bee wanting for the Enterprize, promising great rewards
if it succeeded well. So promising the Kings fauour, and that of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi>
if hee might bee preserued, hee fedde <hi>Bolis</hi> with great
hopes.</p>
            <p>This man being ready to vndertake the Enterprize, without any
longer expectance imbarkes: and hauing Letters of Recommendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and credit, hee goes to <hi>Nicomache</hi> at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> who seemed to be
affected to <hi>Acheus,</hi> as well for his Fathers loue, as for particular
Friendship: And likewise to <hi>Melancome</hi> in <hi>Ephesus.</hi> These in truth
were the men, of whose meanes <hi>Acheus</hi> had formerly made vse, as
well comming to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> as in other forreine and remote places</p>
            <p>Being come to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and afterwards to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> hauing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
them with this businesse, and finding them ready in any thing
hee desired, hee sent <hi>Arian</hi> (being one of those that were vnder his
charge) to <hi>Cambyle,</hi> saying that he had beene sent from <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi>
to leuy forreine Souldiers, and that he had a great desire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serre
with him concerning matters of importance: And therefore he
desired to appoint a time and place where they might meete vnknown
to the World. <hi>Arian</hi> came to <hi>Cambyle,</hi> discouering vnto him his
charge: whereunto hee gaue eare, being ready to doe that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
they prest him, appointing a day and place knowne to them
both: whither being come in the Night, he sent backe <hi>Arian?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As <hi>Bolis</hi> was a <hi>Candiot,</hi> and cunning by Nature, he studied of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
inquiring of all things. Finally, according to the agreement of
<hi>Arian,</hi> he goes to <hi>Cambyle,</hi> and deliuers him the Letters: whereon they
aduise and consult after the manner of <hi>Candiots.</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Treason practised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Acheus</hi> by <hi>Cambyle</hi> and <hi>Bolis.</hi>
               </note> For they had no care
to succour <hi>Acheus</hi> being in danger, but onely to prouide for their owne
safety and commodity. And as they were both <hi>Candiots,</hi> they were
soone of one opinion as followeth: That the ten Talents which <hi>Sosibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
had deliuered, should be equally diuided betwixt them: and then
they should discouer the businesse to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> to make vse of him, and
promise to deliuer <hi>Acheus</hi> into his hands, in giuing them money, and
hopes worthy of their attempt. These things being thus concluded,
<hi>Cambyle</hi> vndertakes that which concernes <hi>Antiochus: Bolis</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side resolues within certaine daies to send <hi>Arian</hi> to <hi>Acheus</hi> with
Letters of recommendation from <hi>Nicomache</hi> and <hi>Melancome.</hi> But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the meanes how <hi>Arian</hi> might enter safely into the Fort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
he giues him charge to doe his duty. If this were done, and that
<hi>Acheus</hi> made answere to those things which concerne <hi>Nicomache</hi> and
<hi>Melancome, Bolis</hi> held himselfe assured, that he might well deliuer him
into the hands of <hi>Cambyle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this resolution they part, eyther of them striuing to effect that
which they had concluded. <hi>Cambile</hi> imbracing the first occasion, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
the businesse vnto the King. As this promise pleased <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
which offered it selfe contrary vnto his hope, so he tooke it part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ioyfully, promising great matters: partly distrusting, he considered
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:16537:171"/>
of either of their opinions and resolutions, But in the end giuing cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite,
thinking that this Enterprize came Diuinely vnto him, he often
intreated <hi>Cambyle</hi> to bring it to an end. <hi>Bolis</hi> wrought in like manner
with <hi>Nicomache</hi> and <hi>Melancome.</hi> Who thinking these things to be
guided by God, they suddainly prepare Letters from <hi>Arian,</hi> direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to <hi>Acheus,</hi> Written by their Common sent, as they had
bbin accustomed: And in sending them they perswaded <hi>Acheus,</hi> togiue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
credit to those things which <hi>Bolis</hi> and <hi>Cambyle</hi> should doe. They were
written in such fort, as being surprized they could not be vnderstood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arian</hi> enters the Fort by the helpe of <hi>Cambyle,</hi> and deliuers the
Letter to those that were with <hi>Acheus:</hi> and instructs him dilligently of
euerything, as one who from the beginning had beene present at that
which was practised. And although hee answered oftner for <hi>Sosibius</hi>
and <hi>Bolis,</hi> then of <hi>Nicomache</hi> and <hi>Melancome,</hi> and likewise for <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byle,</hi>
so hee often maintained by his owne inuention, the Arguments
which they made: And the rather being ignorant of that which had
beene resolued betwixt <hi>Cambyle</hi> and <hi>Bolis. Acheus</hi> giuing credit, aswell
in regard of <hi>Arians</hi> answeres, as of the Letters of <hi>Nicomache</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancome,</hi>
made an answer, and sent <hi>Arian</hi> presently backe. And as this
businesse was handled often of either side, in the end <hi>Acheus</hi> people sent
word of themselues to <hi>Nicomache,</hi> that there was no more hope of
safety remayning: And aduise him to send away <hi>Bolis</hi> with <hi>Arian</hi> at
mid-night, as it were to take them. The resolution of <hi>Acheus</hi> was, that
first he would flye the present danger, and then recouer <hi>Syria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, he was in a wonderfull hope, that if suddainly and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to all hope he shewed himselfe to the Inhabitants of <hi>Syria, Antiochus</hi>
being yet tyed at <hi>Sardainy,</hi> he should cause a great alteration, purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
great praise, aswell with the <hi>Antiocheins,</hi> as with the inhabitants
of base <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Phenicca. Acheus</hi> being in this hope and conceite,
expected the comming of <hi>Bolis.</hi> In regard of <hi>Melancomes</hi> peoples,
after the comming of <hi>Arian,</hi> and the Letters read, they presently
send away <hi>Bolis</hi> with all speede, making him great remonstrances, and
putting him in great hope, if he effected his Enterprize. <hi>Bolis</hi> send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Arian</hi> before, aduertised <hi>Cambyle</hi> of his comming, and came by
night to the place appointed. And when they had agreed on the day,
and had resolued how to bring all to an end, they entred the Campe at
night. This was their resolution: If it hapned that <hi>Acheus</hi> came out
of the Fort alone, or accompanied with some one with <hi>Bolis</hi> and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
he might be taken with an Ambush as abandoned. But if he came
foorth well accompanied, the businesse would prooue difficult, to
those to whom they had giuen the charge. Finally, they thought to
take him aliue, knowing that by this meanes they should do great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to <hi>Antiochus.</hi> Wherefore they gaue charge vnto <hi>Arian</hi> to march
before, when he should draw forth <hi>Acheus,</hi> for that he knew the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
by the which he had often entred and comeforth. <hi>Bolis</hi> was
to follow the rest behind, to the end that being come vnto the place,
where the Ambush should be ready by <hi>Cambyle,</hi> he might seaze vpon
<hi>Acheus</hi> and stay him, fearing that through the Allarum in the night,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:16537:171"/>
he might saue himselfe through the Forrest, or being in Despaire, he
might cast himselfe into some pit: and contrary to their Resolution, fall
aliue into the Enemies hands.</p>
            <p>These things being thus concluded, when <hi>Bolis</hi> came to <hi>Cambyle,</hi> he
was the same night brought by him to <hi>Antiochus</hi> being alone. And
when the King had receiued him graciously, and had assured them of
his promises, making remonstrances to either of them, not to be
negligent in the businesse, they then returned to their Campe. In the
morning <hi>Bolis</hi> accompanied with <hi>Arian</hi> ascend, and at night they enter
the Fort. <hi>Acheus</hi> receiuing him with great affection and loue, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
many things of him dilligently. And as hee obserued aswell
the countenance, as the familiar speech wherewith <hi>Bolis</hi> assured the
plot, he shewed partly a ioyfull countenance, for the hope of his safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
So he partly languished, for the apprehension of the future danger.
But for that he was a man of a great Spirit and great Experience, hee
did not hold it fit to relye wholy vpon <hi>Bolis.</hi> And therefore he vsed
this Speech vnto him: That for the present hee could not go foorth;
and that hee would send three or foure of his friends with him, and
that after conferrence with <hi>Melancome</hi> he would be ready. <hi>Acheus</hi> in
truth did all that could be done: But hee was ignorant of the common
Prouerbe: <hi>That hee must Candize with the</hi> Candyots.<note place="margin">To Candize with the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyots.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Bolis</hi> likewise
had fore-seene all things which concerned this businesse.</p>
            <p>But when the night came, in the which he sayd he would send his
friends, sending <hi>Arian</hi> and <hi>Bolis</hi> before out of the Fort, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them to attend vntill the comming of those which should goe with
them. Whereunto obeying, in the meane time he conferres with his
Wife.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Laodicea</hi> the wife of <hi>Acheius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </note> But for that he had amazed <hi>Laodicea,</hi> with a businesse not
fore-seene, he stayed sometime vntill he had pacified her, and brought
her to an expectance of good hope. Then making the fift, hee attired
the others meanly, and himselfe puts on an old and simple Robe, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himselfe to be a man of a base condition: and so he goes forth. He
had giuen charge to one of his Friends to answere <hi>Arian</hi> continually to
all that he should propound, and that he should learne of him whither
they went, and should speake of the rest as of <hi>Barbarians.</hi> When
they were come to <hi>Arian,</hi> he went before for the knowledge hee had
of the way.</p>
            <p>In regard of <hi>Bolis</hi> he followed behind, according to the first reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
being doubtfull of that which was offered. For although hee
were a <hi>Candyot,</hi> and did diue into all things neerely, yet he could not
know <hi>Acheus,</hi> by reason of the darknesse of the night, nor yet whither
he was there. And as the descent was rough, and for the most part vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie,
and in some place vnsafe and dangerous for the steepnesse, and
being come vnto a certaine place, where as some helde <hi>Acheus</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
receiued him, (at that time in truth they could not wholy forbeare
to yeild him their accustomed reuerence) then <hi>Bolis</hi> suddainely knew
which was <hi>Acheus.</hi> When hee came to the place appointed to <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byle,</hi>
and that <hi>Bolis</hi> had giuen them a signe by his whistle, they of the
Ambush issue forth and take the rest: But <hi>Bolis</hi> seazed vpon <hi>Acheus,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:16537:172"/>
his hands wrapt vp in his Robe, fearing that in discouering the
Ambush, he should attempt to kill himselfe: for hee had a Sword rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
Being thus suddainly inuironed, he fell into the hands of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acheus</hi> taken and brought to <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
               </note>
and was presently led to <hi>Antiochus</hi> with his friends. The King
remaining in suspence, expecting what would become of it, hee was
alone in his Tent waking accompanied onely with two or three of his
guard. But when as <hi>Cambyles</hi> Company was arrived, and had layed
<hi>Acheus</hi> bound vpon the ground, his Speech failed him for so strange
an accident; so as he continued long without speaking: And in the end
toucht with Commisseration and pitty, the teares came into his eyes:
the which in my opinion hapned by a Consideration, that those things
which Fortune brings, are ineuitable and vncertaine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Acheus</hi> was sonne to <hi>Andromachus,</hi> brother vnto <hi>Laodicea</hi> the Wife
of <hi>Seleucus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Race of <hi>Acheus.</hi>
               </note> and he had married <hi>Laodicea</hi> daughter to King <hi>Methridate,</hi>
and withall hee was Lord of all the Region on this side Mount <hi>Tauris.</hi>
As hee was then held to liue in a place of his owne wonderfull strong
for the Enemy, so he was now set vpon the ground bound and manna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled
in their hands: Neither was there any man that knew of the fact,
but those which had the Execution. But when the day was come, and
that the friends (according to the custome) were come vnto the Tent,
and saw this accident, it hapned vnto them as it had done formerly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the King. For in wondring at the businesse, they were in doubt of
those things which they saw. When the Councell was assembled,
they spake many things of him touching his defeate. First they decreed
that his hands and feete should be cut off,<note place="margin">The condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation &amp; death of <hi>Acheus.</hi>
               </note> and then hauing taken of his
Head it should be sowed to an Asses skinne, and the rest of his body
hanged vpon a Crosse. Which being Executed and the Army hearing
thereof, the fury and alteration was so great in the Campe, as <hi>Laodicea,</hi>
who knew nothing but the departure of her Husband, looking from
the Fort, coniectured of that which had happened by the trouble and
alteration in the Campe.</p>
            <p>A Herald was presently sent vnto <hi>Laodicea,</hi> who aduertised her of
those things which had befalne <hi>Acheus,</hi> commaunding to consider of
Her estate, and to leaue the Fort. At the first they which held it made
so great cries and lamentations, as they could giue no answere: Not so
much for the affection they bare to <hi>Acheus,</hi> as for the accident which
seemed to them all vnlooked for and not fore-seene. Finally, they were
in great doubt what they should do. <hi>Antiochus</hi> after the ruine of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus,</hi>
prest the besieged more violently, perswading himselfe that in
the end hee should haue meanes to take it by the Souldiers themselues:
the which happened accordingly. For they beeing diuided among
themselues,<note place="margin">The strong fort yeilded to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus.</hi>
               </note> they parted into Troupes, some holding for <hi>Ariobaze,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for <hi>Laodicea.</hi> After which, both parties yeilded for their mutuall
distrust, and deliuered the place.</p>
            <p>To conclude, as <hi>Acheus</hi> had done what hee could in reason, (being
vanquished by the wickednesse of those which assured him) lost his life,
seruing for a profitable Example to posterity for two causes. First, that
no man should relye simply vpon any: And next, that no man should
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:16537:172"/>
mistake himselfe for his good Fortune, but be prepared for all accidents,
which may happen to man. And therefore in the beginning they goe
forth, as it were to take some spoiles, and come by night to the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi>
Campe: Others held the close way, staying at a certaine
place full of Woods.<note place="margin">He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

               </note> But <hi>Philimene</hi> and <hi>Nicon</hi> approacht the Campe:
Whom the Watch led Prisoners to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> they neuer discouering
of whence nor what they were: making onely a signe that they would
speake with the Generall.</p>
            <p>Being then brought vnto <hi>Hannibal,</hi> they told him that they would
speake with him in secret. Who giuing them Audience with great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
they excuse themselues and their Countrey, accusing the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
in many sorts, to the end they should not seeme to be come
forth about this businesse without cause. Wherefore <hi>Hannibal</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
them much, and entertained them curteously: Finally, hee
sent them backe to returne speedily to conferre with him, ordering for
the present that these men should be let go: when they were out of the
Campe, and in the meane time he would consider what should be most
safe. This he did to haue conference with these young men, and to
inquire of their affaires:<note place="margin">

            <p>When as <hi>Nicon</hi> had Executed his Charge, <hi>Hannibal</hi> was very well

the businesse propounded, for that they had giuen him a safe accesse
to speake, and he had found <hi>Hannibal</hi> very attentiue, promising him
to giue store of Victuals to the Cittizens. Then they not onely got
credite with the <hi>Tarentins,</hi> but moreouer they had a good Traine, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
for the accord made, as for the Victuals whereof they had suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.
Afterwards making a second incursion, and putting euery thing
in Execution, they assured <hi>Hannibal:</hi> and were likewise assured by
him, (that is to say,) that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> should leaue the <hi>Tarentin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in their Liberty, not oppressing them with any Subside or Tribute, nor
with any other impost: Being also lawfull for them, after they had
Conquered the Citty, to ruine the <hi>Romans</hi> Houses. Finally they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,
that when they should come vnto the Campe, the Watch
should presently take them.</p>
            <p>Which things being concluded, they had power to come and speake
often with <hi>Hannibal:</hi> parting from the Citty sometimes to get spoyle,

to the end they might speedily open the Gate called <hi>Rhinopile.</hi> He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
and went forth often in the night by this Gate, vnder colour of
feare of the Enemy, but in the meane time hee made vse of it for his
Enterprize.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Philimene</hi> had obtained this course with the Guards, so as
without suspition approaching to the Wall, if he whistled, they ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vnto him the Gate <hi>Rhinopile:</hi> And withall obseruing that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Gouernour of the Gate, should be on a certaine day with great
Company at <hi>Musea</hi> neere the Market place, they appointed that day to
<hi>Hannibal.</hi> He had long before inuented this fiction, as if hee were
sicke, to the end the <hi>Romans</hi> should not hold it strange, that he staied
so long there; and then he feined himselfe to be more sicke. Hee had
not beene in the Campe for the space of three daies vpon the approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of <hi>Tarentum.</hi> The day being come, he makes choise of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
of the ablest and resolutest men, both Horse and Foote: to whom
he giues charge to carry Victuals for foure dayes. Finally hee marcht
speedily, remoouing his Campe at the breake of day. He gaue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
to foure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>score <hi>Numidian</hi> Horses to marcht thirty Furlongs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Campe, and that they should run of eyther side of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
to the end that no man might discouer the whole Campe, but
taking some of them that fled, the rest which escaped might aduertise
the Citty of the <hi>Numidians</hi> courses. When as the <hi>Numidians</hi> were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
twenty Furlongs off, they set downe to Supper neere vnto a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Riuer, in a Rocke which was not easie to discouer.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Hannibal</hi> drawing the Captaines together, he discouers his
Enterprize vnto them; and perswades them, that first of all they should
carry themselues like braue men: for that there were neuer such great
rewards propounded vnto them: And that secondly euery man should
keepe his Souldiers in obedience during the Voyage, and punish those
seuerely, that should abandon their places thorough Disobedience. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
they should haue a care of those things which should bee Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded,
and that they should not attempt any thing of their owne
fancy, contrary to his Commandement. This Speech being deliuered
in the presence of the Captaines, he marcht, (being yet night) meaning
to come vnto the Walls about mid-night. Hee had <hi>Philimene</hi> for his
Guide, to whom hee gaue <hi>Synagrie</hi> for a Companion in that same
Action.</p>
            <p>VVhen as <hi>Calus Lybius</hi> with his Company were in the day time at
<hi>Musea,</hi> according to the conception of the Youth, they aduertised
him that the <hi>Numidians</hi> ouer-ran the Country towards the West, when
as their desire of drinking increased. Yet thinking to stay them, hee
called for the Captaines, giuing them charge to go forth at the breake
of day with halfe the Horse-men, and repulse the Enemy which spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
Countrey. This was all the conceite he had of the businesse. As
for those which kept Company with <hi>Nicon</hi> and <hi>Tragisque,</hi> assembling
suddainly within the Citty, they looked for the returne of <hi>Caius.</hi> And
being suddainly ready, for that they had drunke in the day time, some
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:16537:173"/>
retiring to certaine places stayed there: Others among the Youth go to
meete <hi>Caius,</hi> sporting and playing among themselues, making shewe
to bring them backe which should be found at the Banquet, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
as it were, transported by reason of the Drunkennesse of <hi>Lybius</hi>
Company, as soone as they met they fell to laughter and immoderate
sport of either side: then turning head they Conducted <hi>Caius</hi> vnto his
House. He layd him downe to rest as a man soundly drunke, after
the manner of those which drinke daily, hauing nothing in his braine
that troubled him: finally, he was full of ioy and negligence. But <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi>
and <hi>Tragisque;</hi> hauing assembled the Youth, diuided themselues
into three Band: and after aduice, they seazed vpon the most commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
approaches to the Market place, to the end that nothing might
be vnknowne vnto them, of that which was practised, aswell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Citty as without.</p>
            <p>They also approached neere vnto <hi>Caius</hi> House, being resolued that
if he should haue any suspition of the Enterprize, to kill him first: And
that whatsoeuer they did they should beginne with him. As it often
times happens at the returne from Banquets, when as the Tumult was
suddainly past, and that the multitude was layd downe and a sleep, and
by the aduancement of the night, the hope of the Enterprize remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
entire, then altogether attend the Execution. The Youth had
articulated and agreed with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">An accord made by the youth of <hi>Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> with the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>
               </note> that <hi>Hannibal</hi> comming
to the Citty, neere vnto <hi>Musacee</hi> on the East, and to the Gates which
they call <hi>Temenides,</hi> he should make a fire vpon a little Hill, the which
some call the Hill of <hi>Hyacinthe,</hi> and others of <hi>Apollo Hyacinthe.</hi> And
that when <hi>Tragisques</hi> Company should see it, they should answere him
by the like signe of fire: This done, <hi>Hannibal</hi> should quench the fire
which hee had made without the Citty, and then approach with a
slow pace.</p>
            <p>These things thus concluded, the Youth of the Citty hauing past the
inhabited part, they came to the Monuments of the Deceased. The
Easterne part of the Citty of <hi>Tarentum,</hi> was full of Monuments: For
that all the dead are buried within the Walls of the Citty, according
to a certaine old Oracle. They say that God gaue the <hi>Tarentins</hi> to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
by an Oracle, that it would be best for them when they had
most Inhabitants. For their parts they thought, that they should haue
a good dwelling according vnto the Oracle, if they retained the dead
within their Citty. For this cause they interre them within their wals.
When as the Youth of the Citty was come to the <hi>Pithyonique</hi> Hill, they
expected what would succeede. <hi>Hannibal</hi> approaching did what had
beene concluded: and the Company of <hi>Nicon</hi> and <hi>Tragisque</hi> seeing the
fire, they tooke courage, and kindled another fire. Againe seeing <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibals</hi>
fire quencht, they made hast and ran vnto the Gate, meaning
to preuent <hi>Hannibals</hi> men in killing the Guards: for that the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
preparing to enter marcht slowly. When they had preuailed in
their Enterprize, and the Guards being surprized, some slew them, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
brake the Bolts. The Gates being suddainly opened, <hi>Hannibals</hi>
men came with such a measured March, as without any delay they
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:16537:174"/>
assailed the Citty. When they had made their entry safely and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Tumult,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tarentum</hi> taken by <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
               </note> thinking they had done the greatest part of their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
they entred the Market place boldly, on that side which ioines
to the Sea. In regard of the Horse-men, they leaue no lesse then two
Thousand within the Walls for their supply, as well for the accidents
which might happen without, as for other expected things which do
vsually chance.</p>
            <p>When they were come vnto the places neere vnto the Market, the
Army made a stand. <hi>Philimene</hi> likewise being much troubled, how he
might execute his Charge, staied without. For when they made the
fire, they ranne not to that Gate: and they had sent him with a wilde
Boare, and about a Thousand <hi>Lybians</hi> with him to the next Gate, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to execute their Enterprize, not by one meanes only but by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
When as <hi>Philimene</hi> was according to his Custome come vnto the
Walls, the Guards suddainly were ready descending to <hi>Rhinopile.</hi> When
as he called vnto them to open the Gate, for that hauing a Boare, hee
was soare laden, the Guard hearing those words open speedily, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
to haue a share of <hi>Philimenes</hi> prize, as formerly hee had done
to others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philimene</hi> being the first of this Battalion enters, accompanied by
another, wearing a <hi>Numidian</hi> Habite, as if hee had beene of that
Countrey: after whom followed two others, carrying Venison. When
there were foure entred, they slew him which opened the Gate, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
simply and without feare,<note place="margin">They kill the po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

number of Thirty <hi>Lybians</hi> by the little Wicket, which followed them
a slow pace and secretly. This being done, some brake the Hinges, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
slew the Guards at the Gate, and others called the <hi>Lybians</hi> by
signes being yet without, leading them to the Market place, as it had
beene ordred. <hi>Hannibal</hi> ioyfull of the adiunction of these men, for
that matters succeeded according to his desire, he was attentiue to that
which he had begunne. Hee therefore drawes two Thousand <hi>Gaules</hi>
a part: and diuiding them into three Bands, hee appoints to eyther of
them two of the Youth which had mannaged this Enterprize, with
some of his Captaines, giuing them charge, that they should gaine
the most commodious approaches to goe vnto the Market place. After
which they should receiue the Youth of the Citty, and haue a care to
preserue the Cittizens, and that they should crye out to the <hi>Tarentins,</hi>
to stay in the place which was assigned them for their safety. Finally,
hee Commaunds the Captaines of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and <hi>Celts,</hi> that
they should kill all the <hi>Romans</hi> they should encounter. Diuiding them
selues one from another, they dispatch that which they had in charge.
The Enemies entry being knowne to the <hi>Tarentins,</hi> the Citty was full
of cries and vnexpected Trouble.</p>
            <p>When as <hi>Caius</hi> was aduertised of the Enemies entry, thinking that he
should not be able to preuent the danger, by reason of his drunkennesse,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caius</hi> saues himselfe.</note>
he gets suddainly out of his lodging with his family: And when hee
was come to the Gate which leads vnto the Port, and that the Guard
had opened the <hi>Rhinopile,</hi> he escapes that way, and imbarques with
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:16537:174"/>
his people in a little Cocke boate which lay in the Port, and was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to the Fort. Afterwards <hi>Philimene</hi> makes prouision of Roman
Trumpets, whereof some founded neere vnto the Theater, as they had
vsually done. And when the <hi>Romans</hi> ran in Armes according to their
Custome to the Fortresse, the Enterpize was dispatcht to the liking of
the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> But they which being dispersed and without order
entred into those places, some fell into the hands of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
others among <hi>Celts:</hi> Who by this same meanes slew a great
number.</p>
            <p>The day approaching, the <hi>Tarentins</hi> rested in their Houses, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to preuent this inconuenience. For they thought by reason of the
founding of the Trumpets, that this combustion had beene made by
the <hi>Romans;</hi> for that they made no spoile in the Citty. But when they
saw some of their men slaine in the place, and some of the <hi>Gaules</hi> strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the dead bodies of the <hi>Romans,</hi> they beganne to thinke of the
comming of the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> When as <hi>Hannibal</hi> had drawne his
Army into the market place, and that the <hi>Romans</hi> were retired to the
Fort, the which they held before with their Garrison, he causeth a
Proclamation foorth with to be made and proclaimed, that all the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentins</hi>
should come vnto the Market place without Armes. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the Youth, they went vp and downe the Citty crying liberty,
aduising and perswading the Citizens to rest assured that the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
were there for their good. But all the <hi>Tarentins</hi> which held the
<hi>Romans</hi> party, being aduertised of this Action, retired to the Fort:
The rest assembled without Armes at the sound of the Trumpet. To
whom <hi>Hannibal</hi> spake graciously.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Tarentins</hi> had generally conceiued by his Speech, and
vnexpected hope, he sent many of them away, giuing them charge
at their returne, to be carefull to Write the name of the <hi>Tarentins</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
their doores: And if by fortune or chance any one did it to a
<hi>Romans</hi> House, he should be punished with Death. Wherefore hee
made choise of men accustomed vnto this charge, and sends them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
to spoile the <hi>Romans</hi> Houses, willing them to hold and maintaine
the <hi>Tarentins</hi> lodgings for Enemies, which had not the marke of a
<hi>Tarentine.</hi> Finally, hee kept the rest in battaile to succour the others.
When he had drawne together great store of goods by this spoile, and
that the commodities answering the conceiued hope of the <hi>Tarentins,</hi>
came to good, they then returned to Armes.</p>
            <p>The day following <hi>Hannibal</hi> holding a Councell with the <hi>Tarentins,</hi>
decreed to seperate the Citty from the Fort, and to fortifie it, to the
end they should be no more in feare of the <hi>Romans</hi> holding the Fort.
Wherefore he beganne first to fortifie the Citty with pallisadoes, right
against the Wals of the Hill which is before the Fort. And knowing
that the Enemies would stirre and make some attempt, hee appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
sufficient Forces: Thinking that for the future, there would bee
nothing more necessary, to amaze the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to assure the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentins.</hi>
When as they beganne to set vp their impalement, and that
the <hi>Romans</hi> assailed their Enemies with great confidence, courage and
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:16537:175"/>
resolution, <hi>Hannibal</hi> fighting with them a little, prouoked them to
the Combate.<note place="margin">A skirmish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians.</hi>
               </note> But when as many of them past beyond the Hill, he
giuing courage to his men encounters the Enemy. When the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
grew hot, as much as might be in a streight place inuironed with
Wals, the <hi>Romans</hi> in the end beeing roughly repuls'd gaue backe, so
as many of them fell into the <hi>Numidians</hi> hands: Finally the greatest part
being repuls'd, and falling into the ditches, dyed.</p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Hannibal</hi> fortified the Citty with Pallisadoes without
danger, and hauing done all things to his liking hee was at quiet. He
likewise forced the Enemies to remaine shut vp in their Fort, in feare
not onely of themselues, but also of the Fort. In regard of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
hee hath so puft vp their Courage, as they helde themselues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to resist the <hi>Romans,</hi> without the helpe of the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<hi>Hannibal</hi> leauing some little space, from the pallisadoe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Citty, hee made a Ditch answering the Pallisadoe and the
wall of the Fort, from whence some time there were Souldiers drawn
vnto the wall of the Citty. Moreouer hauing Pallisadoed this Ditch,
this fortification prooued not lesse strong then a Wall. Besides the
which within towards the Citty (leauing a reasonable space) hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
a VVall from that part which they call the Sauior, vnto that
which they call Deepe: So as without any Garrison, these Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
would bee sufficient to cause the <hi>Tarentins</hi> to dwell in safety.
Leauing then a sufficient Garrison of Horse for the Guard of the Citty
and wall,<note place="margin">The Riuer of Erota.</note> hee planted his Campe forty furlongs from the Citty,
neere the Riuer which some call <hi>Gallea,</hi> others <hi>Erota,</hi> which name it
hath taken from that other Riuer, passing neere vnto <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> which
they likewise call <hi>Erota.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Tarentins</hi> in trueth haue many such, as well in the Country as
in the Citty, for that vndoubtedly they haue taken their Collony and
Race from the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> The wall beeing finished and ended,
aswell by the diligence and industry of the <hi>Tarentins,</hi> as the helpe and
assistance of the <hi>Carthaginians, Hannibal</hi> resolues to ouer-throw the
Fort. And when hee had prepared and made all things ready for the
siege, the <hi>Romans</hi> hauing receiued into the Fort succours by Sea,
from <hi>Metaponcia,</hi> they were something refresht and comforted, and
in the night assailed <hi>Hannibals</hi> Engines, ruining them all with their
preparations. This made <hi>Hannibal</hi> to despaire of the siege of
the Fort.</p>
            <p>And when the Citty wals were made perfect, he assembles the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentins,</hi>
and lets them vnderstand, that it was very necessary for them
to be masters of the Sea,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibals</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance to the <hi>Tarentins.</hi>
               </note> against the discommodities of the present
time. But as the mouth of the Port was in the Commaund of the
Fort, it was not in their power to helpe themselues with shippes at
their pleasure, or goe out of the Port: VVhere as the <hi>Romans</hi> had
all necessaries brought vnto them safely. So as the Citty should
neuer enioy a perfect freedome and liberty. <hi>Hannibal</hi> considering this,
he let the <hi>Tarentins</hi> vnderstand, that if they which held the Fort, lost the
hope of the comodity of the Sea, they would presently yeild it to them.
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:16537:175"/>
The which the <hi>Tarentins</hi> hearing, they allowed of his Speech, but
they could not at that time effect it, vnlesse they were assisted by the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> Army: The which could not then be done. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could not conceiue whereto <hi>Hannibal</hi> tended, propounding
these things.</p>
            <p>And when he maintained that they might well be masters of the
Sea without the helpe of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> they wondred more, not
being able to vnderstand his conception. When hee had viewed the
place within the Wals, from the Port vnto the outward Sea, he was
of opinion that the Ships might saile close vnto the Wall towards the
South. When hee had giuen this aduice vnto the <hi>Tarentins,</hi> they
not onely imbraced it suddainly, but commended <hi>Hannibal</hi> wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.
Presently after they had made Wheeles, they prepared a way
for ships, which was sooner done then spoken, for that affection and
the multitude of Worke-men preuailed much. By this meanes the
<hi>Tarentins</hi> past their ships into the open Sea, and safely besieged those
of the Fort, who receiued their succours from abroad. In regard of
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> leauing the Citty he raised his Campe, and returning three
dayes after, to the Pallisadoe which he had made in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
hee stayed to spend the rest of the
Winter.</p>

with great strength and Courage: And being well armed, they
went not out of the Campe with their Ensignes. <hi>Hannibal</hi> bearing
these things impatiently, and the rather for that the <hi>Romans</hi> could
not any way bee annoyed from the Towne, studied what order
he might take for the present Affaires. For my part, I thinke that the
case falling out thus, seemes to haue made not onely the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
to doubt, but all other men to whom the knowledge thereof
hath come.</p>
            <p>Who will not wonder, hearing how the <hi>Romans</hi> haue often beene
vanquished by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and durst not present themselues, nor
fight with them, haue not abandoned their Fort beeing in the open
field? It is certaine that in times past, they had alwayes Camped
onely at the bottome or foote of Mountaines against the Enemies:
But now being in a faire Plaine, and in the openest place of all <hi>Italy,</hi>
besieging a strong Towne, they were assailed by them of all sides, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
whom they durst not once thinke or immagine to make head,
being so much disheartned. And although the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> preuailed
continually fighting, yet they were no lesse annoyed by the vanquished<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:16537:177"/>
Finally, I hold this to be the cause, that they consider the Enterprize
one of another: That is to say, that the Troupes of <hi>Hannibals</hi> Horse-men,
purchased the Victory to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and a defeate to
the <hi>Romans:</hi> Wherefore the vanquished made suddaine sallies after
the fight. They also lodg'd their Troupes in such a place, as the Horse-men
could not annoy them. The case falling out thus neere vnto <hi>Capo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua,</hi>
was common to them both. The <hi>Romans</hi> in trueth durst not come
foorth to fight, beeing terrified with the Enemies horse. They kept
themselues within their Fort, knowing well that the Cauallery vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
them in fight, they could not annoy them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> likewise could not with reason stay long with
so great a number of Horses: For that the <hi>Romans</hi> had for that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ause
wasted the whole Countrey: Neither could they giue order to haue
Hay and Barley brought on Horse-backe so great a way vnto their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uallery
and Sumpters: Neither durst the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> besiege the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
without Horse, being fortified with Ditches and Pallisadoes: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the which in fighting without Winges vppon an equall danger,
they should hazard an vncertaine Fortune. They feared likewise that
the <hi>Roman</hi> Subiects, would ioyne with them and succour them, and
that cutting of their necessary Victualls, they would draw him into
great distresse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> considering these things, hauing opinion that they could
not raise the siege directly,<note place="margin">A wise Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
               </note> he takes another aduice. Finally, he makes
his reckoning, that if in stealing away suddainly, he should shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
about <hi>Rome,</hi> he might do something that might be profitable for
the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> affaires, the inhabitants beeing amazed with such a
new accident: Or if that did not succeede, hee should force <hi>Appius</hi>
Army to raise the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ege to succour and supply their Countrey, or else
foorth-with diuide themselues, so as they which should succour the
Country, and they which remained at the siege would be easie to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish.
Considering these things, hee sent a certaine <hi>Lybian</hi> messenger
to <hi>Capoua,</hi> perswading him to retire to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and so into the
Citty, prouiding wisely by this meanes, that his Letters might bee
safely carried. He feared much, that the <hi>Capouans</hi> seeing his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
would yeilde, following the <hi>Romans</hi> party, as destitute of hope.
For this cause hee acquaints them with his intention by Letters, for
the which he sends the <hi>Lybian,</hi> after the departure of his Army, to
the end that knowing his resolution and dislodging, they should main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the siege couragiously.</p>
            <p>When as they which besieged <hi>Capoua,</hi> had intreated the people of
<hi>Rome</hi> for assistance, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> held them besieged, they were all
in great doubt and feare, for that the present Affaires required a finall
end, and therefore they sought by frequent Embassies and attempts to
assist that party concerning the Generall. The <hi>Capouans</hi> on the other
side (after they had receiued the Letters by the <hi>Lybian,</hi> and knowne
the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> aduice) hold good against the Enemy, resoluing to
aduenture and trie their Fortune. Wherefore <hi>Hannibal</hi> hauing fedde
his Army the fifth day after his comming, and leauing fires burning,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:16537:177"/>
he rais'd his Campe, so as he was not discouered by the Enemy. Taking
then the difficult way by the <hi>Saunitide,</hi> discouering &amp; gaining by his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uallery
the nearest places to his way, he past the Riuer of <hi>Annion</hi> secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
whilest that the Inhabitants of <hi>Rome</hi> were in suspence for <hi>Capoua</hi> and
that Warre: Approaching in such sort, as he planted his Campe within

               </note> And as he assailed it by this meanes, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
that they of the City were troubled and dismayed with feare, for
that this accident came suddainly and contrary to their hope, and that
<hi>Hannibal</hi> had not formerly besieged the City so neare. They had also
a conceit, that he approaching so neare the City, their Army besieging <hi>Capoua,</hi> must of necessity be defeated.<note place="margin">The amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>

            <p>When as <hi>Hannibal</hi> was thus incampt, thinking to assaile the City the
day following, there happened an admirable and casuall accident, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
for the preseruation of the <hi>Romans. Caius</hi> and <hi>Publius</hi> had taken
an Oath of the Souldiers which had beene leuied, to come to <hi>Rome</hi> the
the same day in Armes. They also made another Leuie: so as at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
time a great number of men of Warre transported themselues sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
to <hi>Rome.</hi> With the which the Captaines made a bold sally: and
planting their Campe before the City, they restrained <hi>Hannibals</hi> fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in truth at the first made such an attempt, as
they despaired not to take the City by assault. But seeing the Enemies
to hold a Campe, and aduertised by a Prisoner of that which had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
they desisted from their Enterprize to take the Towne, falling
to spoile the Countrey,<note place="margin">The <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> waste the Countrey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> and to fire their houses: so as at the first they
brought a wonderfull booty vnto their Campe, as being come to this
kind of hunting, to the which neuer Enemy thought to attaine. And
when as afterwards the Consuls taking courage, had planted themselues
within Eleuen Furlongs of the Enemies Campe,<note place="margin">The <hi>Romans</hi> is Field.</note> 
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> lost all hope
of taking the City, notwithstanding the great spoiles which hee had
made; and which is more, he parts at the breake of day with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
keeping a good reckoning of dayes, in the which according to his
aduice taken from the beginning, he was in hope that <hi>Appius</hi> aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of the danger of the City, would wholly raise the siege, and that
he would succour <hi>Rome;</hi> or leauing some portion of the Army, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the greatest part, he would make haste to succour his Countrey:
either of which happening, his affaires would succeed well. But <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
breaking the Bridges of the said Riuer, forced him to passe his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
at a Fourde, being alwayes in the taile of him, and annoying
him much.</p>
            <p>It is true, he could not defeate him for the great number of Horses,
and the dexterity of the <hi>Numidians</hi> fit for all purposes: yet he retired
to his Fort, hauing recouered a great part of the booty, and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
three hundred men. Afterwards imagining that the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
hastned their retreate for scare, hee pursued them in the Reare by
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:16537:178"/>
Skirmishes. In the beginning <hi>Hannibal</hi> made haste pursuing his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe.
But when as on the fift day he had beene aduertised that <hi>Appi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
continued still at the siege of <hi>Capoua,</hi> he stayed: then suddainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
those which pursued him,<note place="margin">A defeate of the <hi>Romans</hi> by Night.</note> he charg'd them in the Night, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a great slaughter, and chasing the rest out of their Fort. When
as the day following he saw the <hi>Romans</hi> retired to a certaine Hill, strong
by scituation, and rampred, he despaires to take them: Yet making
his voyage by <hi>Daunia</hi> and <hi>Brette,</hi> hee assailes the neighbour places to
<hi>Rhegium</hi> so suddainly, as he had in a manner taken the City: yet he sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised
all those that were stragling in the Fields, with a great number of
the <hi>Rheginois</hi> at his comming. In my opinion we ought with reason to
obserue at that time the vertue and enuy of the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi>
in the conduct of the Warre.</p>
            <p>For as all the World wonders at <hi>Epaminundas,</hi> Generall of the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beins</hi>
in this, that when he was come with the Allies of the Warre to
<hi>Tegee,</hi> and was aduertised that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were with their league
at <hi>Mantinea,</hi> assembling there to giue Battaile to the <hi>Thebeins,</hi> hee
gaue order to his Troupes to feede presently: By this meanes hee cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
his Army to march in the Euening,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lacedemon</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nundas.</hi>
               </note> as it were to recouer some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
places to put them in Battaile. VVhen he had drawne many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this conceite, hee parts to assaile the City of <hi>Lacedemon.</hi> VVhere
entring about three houres in the Night, contrary to all hope, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it naked and destitute of helpe, he tooke it, and kept it on that side
which was paued to the Riuer. As this disaster happened with a great
alteration, and that a certaine Fugitiue flying to <hi>Mantinea,</hi> had aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
King <hi>Agesilaus</hi> of that which happened, and that they of the league
made haste to succour <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> hee was out of hope to bee able to
keepe it. But when he had fed neare vnto the Riuer of <hi>Erota,</hi> and had
drawne his Army together, after that he had suffered many miseries
and dangers, he returnes to <hi>Mantinea,</hi> taking the same way, with hope
to finde it destitue and vnfurnished of <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and their league, as
being gone to succour <hi>Lacedemon:</hi> the which succeeded accordingly.
Wherefore giuing courage to the <hi>Thebeins,</hi> and marching in the
Night with great labour and toile, hee arriued by noone at <hi>Manti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,</hi>
being destitute and void of succours. It is true that the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
who at that time held the party of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> against the
<hi>Thebeins,</hi> were come to their succours. When the foreward of the
<hi>Thebeins,</hi> arriued at the Temple of <hi>Possidon,</hi> standing seuen Furlongs from
the Towne, it happened as a thing fore-cast, that at the same instant
the <hi>Atheniens</hi> shewed themselues vpon a Hill neare to <hi>Mantinea,</hi> who
being discouered by them which remained in the Towne, they went
to the VValles, taking courage to repulse the <hi>Thebeins</hi> attempts. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storiographers
therefore haue reason to complaine of the said actions,
saying, that the Commander had done all that was fitting for a wiser
and more excellent Captaine then the Enemies were, and that <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nundas</hi>
was vanquished by Fortune.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epaminundas</hi> vanquished by Fortune.</note> Some others likewise may say
with reason, that the like hapned vnto <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For who will not wonder at this Commander, in obseruing that hee
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:16537:178"/>
endeauoured to raise the siege, in assailing the Enemy by Skirmishes:
And when hee was therein frustrated in his attempts, hee assailed <hi>Rome</hi>
it selfe: And when this Enterprize did not succeed, for the casuall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents,
hee againe endeauoured (turning head with his Army) to
charge the Enemy, and to try if hee might trouble those which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged
<hi>Capoua:</hi> And when in the end he preuailed not in his Enterprize,
he resolued to annoy the Enemy in ruining them of <hi>Rhegium.</hi> It is true
that some one will happily iudge that at this day the <hi>Romans</hi> are to bee
preferred before the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> Who vpon the first aduertis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
parting together, deliuered <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> yet losing <hi>Mantinea</hi> for
their parts: But the <hi>Romans</hi> preserued their Countrey without raising
the siege from before <hi>Capoua,</hi> growing constantly obstinate in their
Enterprize, and haue in the end assailed the <hi>Capouans</hi> resolutely. I haue
propounded this Discourse not so much to praise the <hi>Romans</hi> or <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians,</hi>
(for we haue many times shewed them to bee excellent) as
well for their present Captaines, and for those which hereafter shall
haue the gouernment of these two Common-weales: to the end that
remembring them, and hauing these things before their eyes with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of imitation, they may take courage, not of a desperate and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
rashnesse, but of a politique resolution, with an admirable industry
and good discourse, which shall neuer be subiect to forgetfulnesse, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
still in memory actions well mannaged; and Enterprizes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reason.</p>
            <p>For this cause the <hi>Romans</hi> haue decreed to set a part, and to carry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Country the things we haue spoken of, not omitting any thing.
If this be well done and profitable to them, or otherwise, it requires a
longer discourse: And moreouer whether it hath beene in former
times, or is onely necessary at this day. If considering these things, they
had instructed their men, it is certaine that according to reason they
had transported to their vse the things for the which they had growne
great: But if leading a simple life, they flye abundance and sumptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and yet they vanquish those which many times haue store of such
good things, why should not their actions be turned to vice? Some
one may confidently say, that they erre which haue left the Victors
course of life, to follow that of the vanquished, and hauing incurred
enuy, a Companion of such things: which is a case much to bee feared
in Great men. Doubtlesse a man thus possest, will neuer hold them hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
which possesse another, and beares them enuie. Moreouer, who
will take compassion of those which degenerating lose their principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?
If Fortune smiles, and if a man drawes together all the wealth of
another, and moreouer, inuites in some sort the dispossest to see it, he
sinnes doubly. First the Spectators haue no compassion, but are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished
as of their owne miseries: whereby not onely enuy but also
choller inflames them against the fortunate. The remembrance of their
owne calamities is as it were a stirring vp to hatred against the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours.
It is true, that it may be there is some shew of reason for the
drawing of Gold and Siluer. For they could not haue attained to the
Empire, if they had not gotten the power taken from others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:16537:179"/>
In regard of those things which concerne not power, they might
leaue them with the enuy in those places where they were before, and
make their Countrey of better fame, in beautifying it with honesty and
magnanimity, not with Images and figures. I hold this Discourse for
those which Potentates alwaies vsurpe, to the end that in sacking Cities
they may not conceiue that the miseries of other men, are the glory and
beautifying of their Countrey. Finally, it is necessary that the accidents
which happen in the Art of Warre, bee diligently considered of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It
may happen they shall duly fore-see euery thing, if any one doth exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
speedily that which is propounded.</p>
            <p>If any man will know that executions done openly with violence,
are of lesse consequence then actions of policy and time, hee may easily
iudge by the actions past. It would be no difficult thing to vnderstand
by the euents, that in matters which are done by time, there are more
found executed through errours then by reason; For no man doubts
that many faults are committed through the ignorance and dulnesse of
Commanders. Wherefore we must consider the reason of this kinde.
It is not fit to hold for good seruice the accidents which without fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
happen in the profession of Warre, but rather for euents and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall
accidents: and wee must leaue them, for that they are not gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by reason, whereas those should be apparent which are done with
a setled resolution whereof we now speake. But for that euery action
hath time, space, and a determinate place, and hath neede of secresie,
and of confident resolutions: and that it doth import by whom, with
whom, and by what meanes they shall execute them: it is apparent
that he which shall duly consider euery one of these things apart, shall
not stray from reason: if he omits any one of them, he shall be defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of his whole resolution. Nature in truth makes one of all the parts,
and euery one of them (although vulgar) sufficeth to cause a disaster of
aduice if it be forgotten: Finally all the parts doe scarce suffice, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they be imployed to bring any worke to a good end. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Commanders should not omit any thing of this kinde.</p>
            <p>Silence is the chiefe of those things which we haue spoken of: to the
end that through ioy if any vnexpected hope presents it selfe, or for
feare and amazement,<note place="margin">The duty of a Commaunder.</note> they do not through familiarity or friendship, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
their enterprize to any stranger, but only to those without
whom they cannot execute their resolutions: nor yet to them, but so far
forth as necessity shall force them. He must be secret not onely in words
but also in his affections. For it happens to many to discouer by signes,
and sometime by their actions, their resolutions which the tongue hath
kept silent. Secondly, it is necessary not to be ignorant of the wayes
both by day and night, and the meanes to passe them as well by Sea
as Land. The third point, and the most exquisite, is to know the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of times by the circumstances, and to be able to coniecture
it with iudgement. He must make no little esteeme of the manner how
to execute it. For many times thereby things which seeme impossible,
proue possible, and those which vsually haue beene possible, are made
impossible. Finally, he must not disdaine the Accords and Articles an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:16537:179"/>
nor the choise of things by the which, and with whom that
which hath bin resolued, is brought to an end. Of these things some are
considered by the exercise, others by Histories, and some by the course
and reason of experience. The knowledge likewise of the waies, and
whither he meanes to go, and its nature would be very fitting<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: and
consequently by whom and against whom they make Warre, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to consider of the businesse, and not to trust all men. It is true that
they which are led and gouerned, must alwaies in such affaires giue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to those that lead them. Moreouer, Commanders may happily
learne these things and other such like from a simple Souldier: some by
their owne industry, and others by History, in considering the actions
experience. It is also necessary to vnderstand the Mathematiques,
and the Theorique, especially of Astrology and Geometry, the Art
whereof is not very necessary in this trade: yet the vse may helpe much
in the alteration of things. Their chiefe necessity consists in the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the Day and Night. If they had beene alwaies equall, there
would be no difficulty therein, and the knowledge would bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all.</p>
            <p>But as the afore-said things haue a difference not onely betwixt
them, but also in themselues, it is most necessary to know what bee
their augmentations and diminutions. How can the course and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of the Day and Night be knowne without the consideration of
the said difference? No man can without their experience attaine vnto
those things which concernes a competency of time, being otherwise
forced to worke sooner or later then is needfull. Haste in these affaires
is more defectiue then the delay of an Enterprize. Hee that exceeds
the time appointed, is frustrated of his hope: But hee may repaire it in
giuing good order, knowing after what time it may be done: whereas
hee that preuents the opportunity of the approaching time, and being
discouered, not onely failes of his Enterprize, but is in danger to be
wholly defeated. Occasion is the Mistresse of all humane affaires, and
especially in the Art of Warre.</p>
            <p>A Commander therfore of an Army must haue knowledge of the
So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stice of Summer, and of the Equinoctials, and of the intermixt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases
and decreases of Dayes and Nights.<note place="margin">The knowledg of the diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Dayes necessary for Captaines.</note> By this onely meanes hee
may hold a meane in things which are to be effected, as well by Sea as
Land. Moreouer, hee must know euery point of the Day and Night,
to the end that hee may vnderstand the time when to plant his Campe
and to raise it. It is not possible that hee shall attaine to a good end
which doth not consider the beginning. It is not impossible to see the
houres of the Sunne by the shaddowes whilest he makes his course, and
the distances which are made by it in this world: In regard of those of
the Night, it is a difficult thing, vnlesse some doe follow and obserue
the Starres after the disposition of the Heauen, and the order of the
twelue Signes in the Zodiacke. It is in truth easie for those which dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
obserue the Celestiall Starres. For although the Nights be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall,
yet in euery one of them sixe of the twelue Signes do mooue, so
as it is necessary that to euery part of the Night an equall portion of the
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:16537:180"/>
Zodiacke be turned, and as daily it is apparent what part the Sun driues
behind, which is that which it separates from the Diameter: it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
that accordingly there should be so much consumed of the Night,
that after this part it appeares eleuated from the rest of the Zodiacke.
The Signes of the Zodiacke being knowne as well for their number as
greatnesse, it falls out afterwards that they shew themselues such all
times of the Night. But when the Nights are cloudy, we must obserue
the Moone: for her greatnesse, her light appeares vniuersall in what part
of the world soeuer she be. And wee must sometimes search by the
times and places of the East, and sometimes of the West: for that in this
part there is a knowledge, so as she followes the Diurnall differences of
the East. There is also in this knowledge a manner of easie considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
There is likewise the same end almost within a figure, and all are of
Sence.<note place="margin">Homer.</note> For this cause they iustly commend the Poet, who brings in <hi>Vlis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
an excellent Prince, taking coniecture of the Starres, not onely to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
a Nauigation, but also to mannage Warre at Land. Wee may in
truth exactly fore-see vnexpected chances, although that many times
they be of great preplexity, as inundations by Raine and Riuers, Snows
and violent Frosts, and finally Fogs and Clouds, with such like things.
Shall we not with reason be destitute and voide of many things by our
owne fault, if wee disdaine those which wee may fore see? Wee
may not therefore contemne or despise any of these things, lest wee
fall into such a consideration which they say hath happened vnto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others: Concerning which wee must now speake by way of
Example.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arate</hi> Chiefe of the <hi>Acheins,</hi> labouring to surprize the City of
<hi>Cynethe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The errour of <hi>Arate.</hi>
               </note> appointed a day to them of the Towne which had the same
intelligence: who comming by Night to the Riuer which fals to <hi>Cyne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the,</hi>
he was to stay there with his Army: and they of the Towne taking
their occasion about Noone, should send forth one of them secretly out
at the Gate, couered with a Cloake, and should command him to stay
before the Gate vpon a Dunghill: and in the meane time the rest should
take the chiefe men sleeping, who were accustomed to guard the Gate
about Noone. Which being done, comming out of their Ambush, they
should plant their Battalion against the Gate. These things thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
<hi>Arate</hi> came at the time appointed, and keeping the accord,
he laid his Ambush neare vnto the Riuer. But about fiue of the Clocke,
a man hauing weake Sheepe of those which are accustomed to feede
about the Towne, came forth of the Gate in a Cloake, as it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
who according to the reason of the time, enquired of the life of the
Shepheard: And staying vpon the sayd Hill, looked where hee was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>
thinking they had giuen him the Signe, makes haste to gaine the
Towne with his men. But when the Gate was suddainly shut by the
Guards that were present, for that they within had nothing ready, it
happened that <hi>Arate</hi> was not onely frustrated of his purpose and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
but was the cause of extreame calamities to the Burgesses,
with whom hee had intelligence. For being apprehended, they
were presently chased away or slaine. What shall wee thinke to be
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:16537:180"/>
the cause of this accident? Doubtlesse for that this Commander had
executed this agreement with more lightnesse then was fit, who being
young had not an exquisite knowledge of these two accords, nor of the
things annexed. The affaires of Warre haue an alteration in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
wauering from one side to another in the Euents. When as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<hi>Cleomenes</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> had resolued to take the City of <hi>Mega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopolis</hi>
by practice, he agreed with the Guards of the Walles,<note place="margin">The errour of <hi>Cleomenes.</hi>
               </note> that hee
should come in the Night with his Army to the Gate which they call
<hi>Pholee,</hi> at the third renewing of the Watch. For they which held
his party, had then the guard of the Wall. But when he had not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene,
that the Nights were shorter at the rising of the <hi>Pleiades,</hi> hee
parting from <hi>Lacedemon</hi> with his Army at Sun setting, and as hee
could not come thither in time, arriuing when the Sunne was vp, he
was repuls'd, making his attempts in vaine and without reason, with
a great and shamefull losse of his men, and in danger to lose all:
Whereas if hee had aim'd truely at the time appointed by the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and had brought his Army when as his Confederates had
power to let him in, he had not failed in his Enterprize.</p>
            <p>In like manner <hi>Philip</hi> (as wee haue formerly sayd) hauing plotted a
secret surprize of the City of the <hi>Meliteens,</hi> failed doubly.<note place="margin">The errour of <hi>Philip.</hi>
               </note> He brought
not Ladders of a sufficient length, as the businesse required, neither did
he obserue the time. For hauing resolued to arriue at Mid-night, when
as all the World slept, hee dislodg'd before the time from <hi>Larisse</hi> with
his Army, and came too soone into the <hi>Meliteens</hi> Countrey. For
this cause as he could not stay, fearing to be discouered by the Citizens,
nor yet steale away, he gaue an assault to the City, the Inhabitants
being yet awake. So as it was not in his power to get to the top of the
Walles by his Ladders, for that they were not of a iust length, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could hee enter by the Gate, for that the Confederates which
hee had in the City, could not succour him being excluded by the
time. And as hee had incensed the Citizens, and made a great losse of
his men, hee returned with shame and disgrace, it being a warning
and caueate vnto all others, not to put any trust or confidence in him
hereafter.</p>
            <p>As likewise <hi>Nicias</hi> which was Chiefe of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> might
haue preserued the Army which hee had neare vnto <hi>Saragosse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The errour of <hi>Nicias.</hi>
               </note> and
had taken a fit occasion in the Night to lay an Ambush, to the end
hee might not bee discouered by the Enemy, hee retired into a safe
place: Afterwards hee remooued not his Campe through supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for that the Moone was Eclipsed, as if shee had fore-told
some ensuing danger and misfortune. But it happened vnto all, as
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell to the Army as Captaines, to fall into the hands of the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gossins,</hi>
when as the Night following <hi>Nicias</hi> raised his Campe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
discouered by the Enemies. Notwithstanding hee might in such
affaires haue beene made wise by such as haue had experience, that
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity of time ought not to be neglected for such things, making
the ignorance of the Enemy his comfort. Ignorance in truth giues a
great helpe to men of experience, to bring their affaires to a good end.
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:16537:181"/>
Wee must then for the afore-said things haue recourse to Astrology, in
regard of the measure of ladders, the manner is as followeth. If any
one of the Conspirators haue giuen the height of the Wall, they may
presently know of what length the ladder shall be: As if the Wall bee
ten foote high in some places,<note place="margin">What a Ladder for the Warre ought to be.</note> the ladders must be twelue foote long.
Finally, they must giue vnto the ladder good footing, according to the
proportion of the staues: left burthening it too much, it breake not
easily by reason of the multitude: and againe set vp straight, it will
be very dangerous vnto them. If there be no meanes to take the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
nor to approach the Wall, let them take the greatnesse of those
things which are eleuated on the Plaine, by the space of all the height,
which is a kinde of measure not onely possible, but also easie for those
which study to learne the Mathematiques.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it is necessary for them that will aime truely in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions
of the course of Warre, to know the vse of Geometry: If
not perfectly, yet at the least that they haue the knowledge of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions,
and consideration of Similitudes. It is not onely necessary
for this,<note place="margin">Geometry ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the Warre.</note> but also for the comprehension of Designes in the scituation
of a Campe: to the end that when as wee sometimes change its gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
disposition, we may obserue the same proportion of things which
are there comprehended: And if sometimes we retaine the same De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes
of Camps, we may extend the place comprehended by them,
or straighten it; according to the reason of things before decreed, or
set apart: the which we haue declared more exactly in our Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
for the ordring of Battailes. I doe not beleeue there is any man
that will be discontented with our study, for that wee charge the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Warre with many things, commanding those that loue it,
not to disdaine Astrology nor Geometry. For my part, I striue especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
and with great desire to command things necessary, as I doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
and blame the excesse of vaine and superfluous things, in regard
of the subtilties and dreames in euery Science: So doe we those which
are out of necessary vse. It is strange thing that they which practise
Dancing, or playing of the Flute, take the preparatiues which concernes
the accords and Musicke: And likewise Wrestling, for that this kind
of Art seemes behoouefull to bring this exercise to an end: And yet
they which terme themselues Souldiers, are discontented if they must
allow of any other Studies: So as they which practise Mecanique
Arts,<note place="margin">The carelesnes of Souldiers for the Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> are more carefull and studious then those which challenge an
Excellency in things which are of great honour and glory: the which
no man of Sence will deny. But wee haue spoken enough of this
Subiect.</p>
            <p>Many coniecture the greatnesse of things by the Circui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e: to whom
notwithstanding it seemes incredible, that although the City of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galopolis</hi>
bee contained within the Circuite of fifty Furlongs, and that
of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> within forty eight,<note place="margin">The circuite of <hi>Megalopolis</hi> and <hi>Lacedemon.</hi>
               </note> yet it is twice as great as that of
<hi>Megalopolis.</hi> And if any one (meaning to make this doubt greater)
sayth, it is possible that a City, or the Pallisadoe of a Campe,
hauing the Circuite of forty Furlongs, may bee more ample and
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:16537:181"/>
compleate then that of a hundred, this will seeme vnto them a mad
and extrauagant speech: the cause is, for that wee remember not the
things which inhumane Disciplines are deliuered vnto vs by Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
This is the cause why I haue vndertaken this Discourse. For that
not onely many people, but also some of those which gouerne the
Common-weale, and likewise Commanders and Captaines are ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
and wonder how it can be possible, that the City of <hi>Lacedemon</hi>
should be greater then that of <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> seeing the circuite is lesse:
and that consequently they coniecture the number of men by the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuite
of the Campe.</p>
            <p>There is another such like errour which they commit in the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Townes. For many conceiue, that Cities containe more houses
which are crooked and hilly, then those which are in a flat Countrey.
But this is not true, for that the houses are not of a good building in a
declining Streete, but in a plaine Countrey, for the which it happens
that the Hils yeeld: the which may appeare by that which is apparent
in a Plaine. If thou doest consider the houses which are built high, and
set vpon the declining of a Hill, so as they are all of an equall hight, it
is apparent that their tops being leuell, the distance is equall, as well of
those which are built vnder the Hils, as those which are seated on the
Plaine neare vnto the foundations of the Wall. It sufficeth at this time
to haue spoken to those which (desiring the preheminence ouer others,
and to gouerne Common-weales) are ignorant of these things, being
amazed and wonder at this relation. The City of <hi>Agragas</hi> is not onely
more excellent among many other Cities, but also for the force of its
Rampire,<note place="margin">The City of <hi>Agragas.</hi>
               </note> and for the grace and building. It is built eighteene Furlongs
from the Sea, so as euery man may be partaker of her commodities, the
Walles are excellently fortified by their scituation and the industry of
man. The Wall is seated vpon a hard and inaccessible Rocke, as well
by Nature as by Art. It is enuironed with Riuers. For towards the
South runs a Riuer of the Townes name, and on the Westerne part to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Winter Solstice, passeth the Riuer of <hi>Hypse.</hi> The Fortresse
is seated vpon the side of the Summers East. The which hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an inaccessible valley and within it one approach to the City. On the
top is built the Temple of <hi>Minerua,</hi> and of <hi>Iupiter A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>abarin,</hi> like as
at <hi>Rhodes.</hi> For as <hi>Agragas</hi> hath beene peopled by <hi>Rhodiens,</hi> their God
with good reason hath the same name, as at <hi>Rhodes.</hi> Finally the City
is stately adorned with Temples and Porches. In regard of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Iupiter</hi> Olympian, it is none of the most sumptuous: But like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it seemes not lesse in its height and greatnesse then any other of

The which when as <hi>Philip</hi> had made Captiue, and ordained to serue

                        <p>In regard of the authority of your City, it seemed for a time to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour

what neede is there to relate in particular the Deeds of those which
haue succeeded them, and how ill they haue intreated <hi>Greece?</hi> There
is no man so negligent of the actions of Warre, which doth not know
how <hi>Antipater</hi> (the <hi>Grecians</hi> being vanquished neare vnto <hi>Lamiai</hi>) did
most wickedly intreate the miserable <hi>Athenians</hi> and others:<note place="margin">Antipater.</note> To whom
hee was so outragious and vniust, as hee sent Inquisiters for Fugitues,
and sent to the Cities, against those which had contradicted him, or
in any fort offended the honour of the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> Whereof some
being violently drawne out of the Temple, and others from the Altars
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:16537:182"/>
themselues, haue beene miserably defeated and slaine: the other
Fugitiues haue beene chased out of <hi>Greece.</hi> There was no freedome
but onely in the Nation of the <hi>Etoliens.</hi> In regard of the executions
done by <hi>Cassander, Demetrius,</hi> and <hi>Antigonus, Gonas,</hi> who is ignorant
of them? The knowledge hath beene manifest, seeing they haue beene
done without any disguising. Some of them placed Garrisons in
Townes, others setled Tyrants: By which meanes there hath not beene
any City free from the name of this kind of seruitude.</p>
                        <p>But leauing this Discourse, I come in the end to <hi>Antigonus:</hi> to the
end that none of you considering plainely my intent,<note place="margin">Antigonus.</note> may thinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
beholding to the fauour of the <hi>Macedonians. Antigonus</hi> in truth
hath not made Warre against you for the preseruation of the <hi>Acheins:</hi>
neither for that he was offended with the Tyranny of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to set the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> at liberty (it were too great a folly, if you
were of this opinion) but for that he saw his power was not assured, if
the principality of <hi>Morea</hi> were vnder your gonernment, and withall he
saw the industry of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> and that Fortune smiled vpon you, the
which he feared with enuie. He came not to giue succours to <hi>Morea,</hi>
but to rauish your hopes, and abate your greatnesse. Wherefore the
<hi>Macedonians</hi> are not so much worthy of loue, Lording it ouer this
City which they haue ruined, as to be held for Enemies and odious,
seeing he hath alwaies hindred you, when you had meanes to command
all <hi>Greece.</hi> In regard of the iniquity of <hi>Philip,</hi> what neede is there
to vse any long discourse? His execration towards the Gods,<note place="margin">The blame of <hi>Philip.</hi>
                           </note> for the
outrages committed in the Temple of <hi>Thermes</hi> is plainely declared:
And as for his cruelty to men, it is fully exprest by this preuarication,
and the accord violated with the <hi>Messeniens.</hi> Finally, the <hi>Etoliens</hi>
haue alone among the <hi>Grecians</hi> made head against <hi>Antipater</hi> in the
view of all the World: so as they liued in safty which were outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
afflicted. They haue also withstood the attempt of <hi>Brennus</hi> and
the <hi>Barbarians</hi> which accompanied him: And they alone being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
haue endeauoured with you to set the principality of <hi>Greece</hi> at
liberty. But it is enough of this Subiect: Wee must now aduise in
some sort, and take order touching this present Councell, as with
them that resolue for the Warre. Wee must consider it according to
the truth.</p>
                        <p>I am also of opinion that as the <hi>Acheins</hi> as the weaker, should not
onely forbeare to spoile your Countrey, but also giue great thankes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Gods if they may preserue their owne: The <hi>Eliences</hi> and <hi>Messe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niens</hi>
will make Warre against them for the league they haue with vs,
the like you will doe. As I vnderstand, <hi>Philip</hi> will desist from his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize,
being assailed by the <hi>Etoliens</hi> at Land, and by the <hi>Romans</hi>
and <hi>Attalus</hi> by Sea. It is moreouer easie to iudge of the future by the
actions past. For making Warre onely against the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> hee could
neuer subdue them, how then will hee support this present Watre?
Take these words according to my first proposition: that it may be noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to all men, that you ought not by a rash and vnaduised Councell,
but by a mature &amp; setled deliberation rather giue succours to the <hi>Etoliens</hi>
                           <pb n="350" facs="tcp:16537:183"/>
the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> And if you haue formerly preuented, and giuen order
for those, what meanes can there remaine? If you haue granted vs
present succours, before you haue receiued the benefits of <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
wee must with reason enquire, if it be fit that in yeilding to the
succeeding benefits, you should contemne the precedent which you
haue enioyed. How this liberty and safety being published hath beene
consumed by <hi>Antigonus,</hi> there are some which reproach it vnto you,
and turne these things to euill, demaunding often whither you should
follow the party of the <hi>Etoliens</hi> or <hi>Macedonians:</hi> You would enter
League with vs in many things, to whom in these affaires you haue
giuen your faith, and you haue it mutually from vs, hauing mannaged
the former Warres with vs against the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> Who can doubt
iustly of these things.</p>
                        <p>It is certaine that the Affaires which you haue with <hi>Antigonus</hi> and
<hi>Philip,</hi> is palliated vnder the Title of courtesie. Finally, what neede
is there to declare that, which since hath beene done vnto you? Either
in regard of the outrage of the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> or the bounty of the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians,</hi>
or for any other thing which hath beene auaileable vnto them?
How can you being now changed, confirme the Accords and Oathes
with them, (which are great Testimonies and Tyes among men) to
whom formerly you had wisely resolued not to obey? </p>

a long discourse of <hi>Phillip</hi> and the <hi>Macedonians. Chlenee</hi> making an end
of his Oration, addes a briefe recapitulation of the right by the which
you were bound vnto them: For hee hath said, if theire bee nothing
which hath beene done Since by the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> which doth hurt or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
after the Succours granted vnto them: or any courtesie done
by the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> this present deliberation, is of a iust considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
If likewise they haue not committed, in producing the things
which concerne <hi>Antigonus,</hi> the which formerly haue beene allowed
by you, I am of opinion that you are the simplest men in the World,
if you renew the Oathes and Accords. For my part, I say you are the
simplest men in the World, and take the vainest resolution, if when
as there hath beene nothing done according vnto his Speech, and the
<hi>Grecians</hi> Affaires remaine such as they were before, when you made the
League with the <hi>Etoliens.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But if this cause hath a very different disposition, as I will shewe in
continuing my Discourse, I thinke it will appeare plainly, that I say
something which will be commodious vnto you, beeing vnknowne by
<hi>Chlenee.</hi> We are come hither to that end, being perswaded that we
are to speake it, to make it knowne. Wherefore it is necessary, if it
may be done, that when you haue heard the calamities which hangs
ouer all <hi>Greece,</hi> you should resolue on that which may be honest and
fit, and to enter into League with vs in the same hope. If this cannot
be done, but at this present you will rest your selues. Yet I hold it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
that in Discoursing in few words of this Subiect, (for that the
others haue presumed to accuse the House of the <hi>Macedonians)</hi> wee
should cleare the ignorance of those, which haue giuen credit to their
Speeches.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Chlenee</hi> hath sayd that <hi>Philip</hi> the sonne of <hi>Amintas,</hi> Conquered the
Principallity of <hi>Thessaly</hi> by the ruine of the <hi>Olyntbiens.</hi> Contrariwise
I am of opinion, that not onely the <hi>Thessaliens,</hi> but the rest of the
<hi>Grecians</hi> haue beene preserued by <hi>Philip.</hi> Who is there among you,
that knowes not that at such time as <hi>Nomarche</hi> and <hi>Philomale,</hi> going to
<hi>Delphos,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The blame of <hi>Nomarche,</hi> and <hi>Philomale.</hi>
                           </note> had vsurped the Gouernement vniustly, and rauished the
Treasure of the Gods execrably, what great forces they then raysed,
against the which none of the <hi>Grecians</hi> durst once open his mouth pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickely.
As they were wicked towards God, so they laboured for to
vsurpe the Principallity of all <hi>Greece.</hi> At what time <hi>Philip</hi> imploying
his forces willingly, defeated the Tyrants, and restored the things safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
which belonged to the Temple: Deliuering withall vnto the <hi>Grecians</hi>
anoccasion of liberty, as the effect doeth testifie to Posterity. The
<hi>Grecians</hi> did not make choise of <hi>Philip</hi> to be their Commaunder, both
at Sea and Land, as hauing offended the <hi>Thessaliens,</hi> as this man hath
presumed to say, but as a Benefactor vnto <hi>Greece:</hi> Which dignity no
man before had euer receiued. It is true, hee came to <hi>Lacedemon</hi> with
an Army. This was not by his owne aduice, as you know: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
called and often prest by his Friends and Allies of <hi>Morea,</hi> whom
hee obeyed vnwillingly. And when hee arriued there, consider <hi>Chlenee</hi>
                           <pb n="352" facs="tcp:16537:184"/>
how hee carried himselfe. When it was in his power to make vse of
the fury of their neighbours, aswell in the spoile of the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi>
Region, as in debasing the Citty; whereby hee should purchase their
fauour, but he would not follow this aduice: But terrified both the
one and the other, and forced them to make an end of their Quarrell,
for their common good and profit. Neither did hee Constitute him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
a Iudge in this Contention, but established men chosen through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all <hi>Greece.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Is this an Act worthy of reproach and reprehension? Thou hast
likewise made the same reproach to <hi>Alexander,</hi> as if hee had wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
afflicted the <hi>Thebeins:</hi> But thou hast made no mention of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
which hee inflicted vpon the <hi>Persians,</hi> to reuenge the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
outrage done to all the <hi>Grecians:</hi> Nor how hee deliuered you
from great miseries, reducing the <hi>Barbarians</hi> into seruitude, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating
their Succours, with the which they ruined <hi>Greece,</hi> making
Warre sometimes against the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and their Ancestors, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
against the <hi>Thebeins:</hi> and that in the end he made <hi>Asia</hi> subiect to
the <hi>Grecians.</hi> As for his Successours, how dares he presume to speake?
They haue beene themselues many times the cause of good to some,
and of hurt to others, during the Calamities of their time: Against
whom some happily may haue cause to remember outrages: But it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
not you, from whom they neuer diuerted any good, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise
preserued you many times from harme. Who are they which
haue called <hi>Antigonus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Demetrius</hi> to subuert the <hi>Acheins?</hi>
Who are they moreouer which haue made a League, and sworne it with
<hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Epirote</hi> to ruine <hi>Acarnania,</hi> and to diuide it: Haue not
you done it?<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Epirote.</hi>
                           </note> Who hath sent such Commaunders contrary vnto the
publique good, as you haue done? Who were not ashamed to infringe
the liberties.</p>
                        <p>How hath <hi>Tymeus</hi> sackt the Temple of <hi>Neptune</hi> in <hi>Tasmare,</hi> that of
<hi>Artimedes</hi> at <hi>Luses?</hi> In regard of <hi>Phariques,</hi> he hath ruined the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Iuno</hi> in <hi>Argos.</hi> And <hi>Polycrates</hi> that of <hi>Neptune</hi> in <hi>Mantinea.</hi>
What hath <hi>Lattabe</hi> and <hi>Nicostrates</hi> done? Haue they not infringed the
Accords of the <hi>Pambiolates</hi> with <hi>Panegyre,</hi> and practised the cruelty of
<hi>Sytheans,</hi> and <hi>Gallatians,</hi> or <hi>Gaules,</hi> so as nothing hath beene done by
the Successours? And when you could not excuse them, you holde
it a glory that you haue broken the attempts of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> falling
vpon <hi>Delphos:</hi> Saying moreouer that for this cause the <hi>Grecians</hi> ought
to giue you thankes. And if they must acknowledge this commodity
from the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> what honour do not the <hi>Macedonians</hi> deserue, who
imploy the greatest part of their liues continually, to maintaine the
safety of the <hi>Grecians</hi> against the <hi>Barbarians?</hi> What is hee that doeth
not know that the <hi>Grecians</hi> haue beene continually subiect to great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
if the <hi>Macedonians</hi> and the bounty of their Kings had not serued
them for a Rampire? VVhereof behold a great Argument: For when
as the <hi>Gaules</hi> disdaining the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> had vanquished <hi>Ptolomy</hi> sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
<hi>Ceraune,</hi> they came presently into <hi>Greece</hi> with <hi>Brennus</hi> Army:
The which had often happened, if the <hi>Macedonians</hi> had not had the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:16537:184"/>
charge. And although I could holde a long Discourse of ancient
deedes, yet I thinke these presents will suffice. But for that which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other things <hi>Philip</hi> hath done, hee turnes to cruelty the ruine of
the Temple: But hee doth not adde their outrage and insolency, which
they haue committed in the Temples and Oratories of the Gods, which
are in <hi>Die</hi> and <hi>Dodone,</hi> the which hee should haue spoken first. You
relate the wrongs and miseries you haue indured, and make a greater
shew then is needfull, passing ouer in silence, those which you haue
formerly committed in great numbers: For you know, that euery out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and wrong that is done, is by all men reiected vpon those, who
haue first done the wrong vniustly.</p>
                        <p>As for the deedes of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> I will onely make mention, to the
end his Actions may not seeme to you worthy of contempt: neither
must you lightly regard a deede of great esteeme. I doe not thinke
there were euer so great a benefit seene, as that which hee hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
vnto you. It seemes vnto me so excellent, as there cannot be a
greater: The which may appeare by this. <hi>Antigonus</hi> made Warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
you, then in giuing you Battaile, he vanquished you by Armes:
Hee was in the end Lord of the Country and Citty, hee might by the
Law of Armes haue intreated you roughly: But hee was so far from
offering you any outrage, as beside other Benefits, he hath (chasing
the Tyrant) restored your Lawes and proper rights. For which Fact
ordaining a Testimony to the <hi>Grecians</hi> by publicke praises, you haue cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him <hi>Antigonus</hi> your Benefactor and Sauiour. VVhat should you then
doe? I will tell you, seeing there is hope of your good Audience: The
which I will doe, and not without reason, not to charge you with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
but for that the quallity of matters forceth mee, to speake
that which is necessary in publicke. VVhat shall I then say? That in
the former VVarre you should haue imbraced the League of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians,</hi>
and not of the <hi>Etoliens:</hi> And that at this day you should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
revnite your selues with <hi>Philip,</hi> seeing hee calls you then
with them.</p>
                        <p>You answere, that in doing so, you shall breake your Accords. But
tell me, if you shall commit a greater mischiefe, in leauing the Accord
which you haue made in particular with the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> then in Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing
those which concerning all the <hi>Grecians,</hi> are grauen and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
vpon a Pillar? Why doe you so superstitiously flie the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
of those, from whom you neuer receiued any benefit: And beare
no respect to <hi>Philip,</hi> nor to the <hi>Macedonians:</hi> from whom you haue
the power to hold this Councell? Thinke you that right and equitie,
ought to bee preserued to Friends? Yet the Sanctitie is not so great to
obserue the Faith reduced in Writings, as the sinne is prophane and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable
in bearing Hatred, and making Warre against a publicke body.
What the <hi>Etoliens</hi> require now of you? But we haue spoken enough
of this Subiect, the which would be held by the Enuious, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
the present businesse. I returne therefore to the Continuation
and Discourse of the cause which consists in this. If the Affaires be at
this day a like, as when you made an Alliance of Warre with them,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:16537:185"/>
the election of things propounded in the beginning must remaine in
you. If they be altogether changed, it is fit you should consider iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
vpon that which they require.</p>
                        <p>I demand of you <hi>Cleonice</hi> and <hi>Chlenee,</hi> what allies had you when as
you called these men to a Common warre. Had you all the <hi>Grecians?</hi>
With whom at this day haue you communication of your hope? Or
to what league doe you inuite these men? Is it not of <hi>Barbarians?</hi>
Thinke you this present warre is like vnto the precedent, and not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent?
You contended then with the <hi>Acheins,</hi> and your kinsmen the
<hi>Macedonians,</hi> and with <hi>Philip,</hi> for principality and glory: And now
the warre is made by strangers against <hi>Greece</hi> for its seruitude, whom
you thinke to draw against <hi>Philip.</hi> Are you ignorant that their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are call'd in against your selues and all <hi>Greece?</hi> Like vnto those
which during a warre retire into their City a greater Garrison then their
owne forces for their owne safety, make themselues subiect to their
friends, as soone as they are freed from the feare of their Enemy: The
<hi>Etoliens</hi> thinke the same at this day. Whilst they desire to vanquish
<hi>Philip,</hi> and to humble the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> they doe not obserue how they
blind themselues with a westerne fogge, the which happily may bring
some darknesse to the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and in the end be the cause of great
miseries to all the <hi>Grecians.</hi> It is therefore necessary for all <hi>Greece,</hi> to
prouide for the threatnings of this time, and especially for the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians.</hi>
Otherwise what cause thinke you my Masters of <hi>Lacedemon;</hi>
had your Ancestours, when as <hi>Xerxes</hi> demanded by an Embassadour
which he sent vnto you Water and Earth, they cast him that was sent
into a Well, and cast Earth vppon him: Then taking him out againe,
they gaue him charge to tell <hi>Xerxes</hi> that hee had Water and Earth in
<hi>Lacedemon?</hi> Moreouer, for what reason did the Company which was
slaine with <hi>Leonides,</hi> cast themselues vppon the Enemy in view of all
the World? Was it not to the end they might see them vndergoe the
danger, not only for their owne liberty, but also for the rest of <hi>Greece?</hi>
Consider now, if it be decent and fitting for their posterity, to take
Armes, and to make VVarre with the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> in allying themselues
with them, against the <hi>Epirotes, Acheins, Acarnanians, Beocians, Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liens,</hi>
and in a manner against all the <hi>Grecians,</hi> holding nothing infamous,
so as it were profitable. VVhat must they attend that doe such
vnlawfull things?</p>
                        <p>As the <hi>Romans</hi> haue beene vnited to them, so the others haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauoured
(hauing the said comfort and aide from the <hi>Sclauonians)</hi> to
make the war by Sea, and to breake the Accord at <hi>Pyles:</hi> And haue by
Land besieged the Citty of the <hi>Clitoriens,</hi> ruining that of the <hi>Cyne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theins.</hi>
It is true, they first made an Accord with <hi>Antigonus,</hi> in regard
of the <hi>Acheins</hi> and <hi>Acarnanians.</hi> But at this day they are Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
with the <hi>Romans</hi> against <hi>Greece</hi> in generall. These things vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
who doth not suspect the comming of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and detest
the sottishnesse of the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> who presumed to enter into such a
League? They spoile the Vines, and the Iland of <hi>Acarnania,</hi> and
haue already taken the Cittie of the <hi>Tallaneins</hi> and <hi>Anticyra,</hi> which
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:16537:185"/>
they with the <hi>Romans</hi> haue ruined, who carry away their VViues and
Children, suffring (as it seemes) the common accidents of those which
fall into the hands of strangers in regard of the soile of these miserable
people, the <hi>Etoliens</hi> enioy it. It were without doubt a very honest and
pleasing thing that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> should imbrace this League, who
would haue the <hi>Thebeins</hi> alone among the <hi>Grecians</hi> liue in peace, when
the <hi>Persians</hi> descended: and haue resolued to make vowes vnto the
Gods to vanquish the <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Your dutie and Honor, my Masters of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> depends thereon,
to the ende that hauing recourse vnto your Ancestors, and fearing the
comming of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and suspecting the bad intent of the <hi>Etoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,</hi>
and putting you in minde of the deedes of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> you may
detest the League of the wicked, and flie the amitie of the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
your selues by a common hope with the <hi>Acheins</hi> and <hi>Macedonians.</hi>
And if some of the chiefe yeild not vnto it, at the least budge not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
make your selues Companions of their Outrages. It is true, that
affection to friends is very profitable, if it bee commodiously made:
But if it be forced, and finally slow and defectiue, it hath no comfort:
and therefore you must obserue, if onely in words, or else in actions
they will keepe their League with you.</p>

and admirable, then those which attempt all things by a discourse of

and fortunate. Moreouer, the one is common vnto the people:
But the other is proper to wise and iudicious men, whom we must hold
diuine and beloued of the Gods.</p>
            <p>For my part <hi>Fabius</hi> seemes to me to haue a Nature and disposition
like vnto <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> the Law-giuer of the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> We must not
thinke that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> had beene so superstitious, as obeying <hi>Pitheas,</hi> he
had established the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Common-wealth: Nor likewise
<hi>Publius Scipio</hi> moued with Dreames and Diuinations, had purchased so
great a power in the Countrey. But for that the one and the other saw
many men not greatly to affect doubtfull affaires, not likewise to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to vndertake matters that were graue and dangerous without the
hope of the Gods: For this cause <hi>Lycurgus</hi> making vse of the same
drawne from <hi>Pytheas</hi> in his opinion, hee made them more pleasing
and certaine. <hi>Publius Scipio</hi> in like manner had made an impression in
many of a conceite of him, that hee executed his Enterprizes by a
certaine Diuine Councell: By this meanes he made his men more
assured, and willing to attempt difficult things. That he hath brought
euery thing to an end by sufficient reason and wisedome, and that
for this cause all his actions haue had an end concurret to reason,
will appeare manifest and plaine by the Discourse which I shall hold
concerning him.</p>
            <p>It is certaine he was bountifull and generous:<note place="margin">The disposition of <hi>Publius Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio.</hi>
               </note> But as for his industry,
sobriety, and vigilancy in his resolutions, no man can conceiue them,
but such as haue liued with him, and haue exactly searcht the depth of
his disposition: amongst the which was <hi>Lelyus,</hi> who had beene his
Companion from his Infancy in all his actions and discourses vnto
his Death: for that hee seemes to speake likely things, and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to his actions. First hee reports this Noble deede of <hi>Publius,</hi>
when as his Father had resolued to fight with <hi>Hannibal</hi> neare vnto
the Riuer of <hi>Poe.</hi> For at that time being as it seemes but seuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
yeares old, going into the Field, hee had receiued from his
Father a Troupe of the best and strongest men for his defence
and guard.</p>
            <p>And when he saw his Father in danger, and enuironed by the Enemy,
accompanied onely with two or three Horse, hauining receiued a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
wound, he began at the first to encourage his company to succour
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:16537:187"/>
his Father: But when they wauered, for the great multitude of the
Enemies,<note place="margin">The courage of <hi>Publius.</hi>
               </note> hee cast himselfe desperafely as it seemes, and charged them
couragiously. Afterwards when the rest were forced to fight, the
Enemies amazed with feare, ceas'd the Combare. Old <hi>Publius</hi> being
thus preserued contrary to all hope, hee was the first who (in hearing
of them all) called him his Sauiour. When by this action the fame
of his prowesse and dexterity began, he afterwards ingag'd himselfe
in greater dangers, whensoeuer the supreame hope of the Countrey
required it by necessity: This was not with a courage relying in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
but of a iudicious Captaine.</p>
            <p>Afterwards <hi>Lucius</hi> his elder Brother, aspiring to the Dignity of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile,</hi>
the which among the <hi>Romans</hi> was the Noblest command of the
Youth, and that by custome they made choise of two <hi>Ediles</hi> among
the <hi>Paricij,</hi> and that there were many at that time which aim'd at it, he
was long before he durst demand it of his Brother. When the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
grew neare, and that he had made a coniecture by the humour of
the multiude, that his Brother would hardly obtaine it, seeing himselfe
on the other side in great fauour with the people, and might attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his attempt, if with their consent he vndertooke the cause, he fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this conceit. When he saw his Mother visite the Temples, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
vnto the Gods for his Brother, and that she entertained a great
hope of the future, which she had in singular recommendation, and
that his Father being then Commander of the Army in the sayd War,
had sayled into <hi>Spaine,</hi> he told his Mother that hee had one dreame
twice, and that it seemed vnto him that he returned being made <hi>Edile</hi>
with his Brother, from the place to goe vnto their house: And that
running vnto the doore, shee had saluted them with imbracings. When
hee had ended this Speech, the Mother being very passionate with an
effeminate affection, and answering I know not what, shee added; Oh
that I might see that Day: will you saies he, that wee make a tryall?
Whereunto consenting, for that she did not thinke he would dare to
attempt so great a matter, considering that he was very young, shee
required (as it were in sport) that he should presently prouide him a
long Cloake. For they which stand for gouernment, are accustomed
to be so attired. In regard of his Mother, shee had no eonfidence in
his words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Publius</hi> when he had this braue Robe, went suddainly to the place,
his Mother being yet asleepe. When the Multitude had receiued him
with amazement,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Publius Scipio</hi> and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther created <hi>Ediles.</hi>
               </note> as well for this nouelty contrary to all hope, as for
the loue and affection they had formerly borne him, and afterwards
drawing to the place appointed, he was neare vnto his Brother, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
adiudg'd this gouernment not onely to <hi>Publius,</hi> but also to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the loue of him: and being both of them created <hi>Ediles</hi> in this
manner, they returned to their house. When the Mother had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the newes, she ran vnto the Gate, and with affection and loue salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them. Wherefore although that <hi>Publius</hi> disdained Dreames, yet it
seemed by this action to all those which haue heard speake of it, that he
had speech with the Gods, not only sleeping, but much more in the day
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:16537:187"/>
waking. But for that he was bountifull and pleasing in his words, and
had well obserued the affection of the Commons towards him, and had
accommodated the time to the people and his Mother, hee not onely
perfected his Enterprize, but also seemed to haue dispatcht in by some
Diuine inspirarinn. They without doubt which cannot duely consider
the occasions, nor the causes and dispositions of euery thing by the vice
of Nature, or ignorance and dulnesse, referre vnto the Gods and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
the causes of things which are decided by industry and discreete
reason. These things I speake for the Readers, to the end that falling
through errour into the vulgar opinions of this man, they should not
leaue good and commendable graces that were in him, that is to say,
his Dextity and Industry. In regard of that which I speake of him, it
will appeare manifest by his actions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Publius Scipio</hi> being then Generall of the Army in <hi>Spaine,</hi> calling his
Troupes together, he aduised them not to be amazed for the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and disgraces past. For the <hi>Romans</hi> had neuer beene vanquished
by the prowesse of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And the rashnesse of the Commanders seperated one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for that they trusted in them: which are things he sayd were then
among the Enemies. For besides that they made Warre being farre
distant one from another, they offer'd outrages to their Allies, and
made them Enemies: And that for this cause some were already sent
home: and the rest will speedily (when they shall be assured) come
when you haue once past the Riuer, not so much for the good will they
beare you, as to seeke a reuenge for the wrongs receiued by the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians.</hi>
But moreouer the Captaines are in dissention among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and will not willingly ioyne together to fight with you: And
being thus diuided, they would be defeated, and fall easily into their
hands. Wherefore he perswaded them, that considering these things
they should passe the Riuer boldly, promising to giue good order for
the rest. When he had vsed this speech vnto the other Captaines, he
left his colleague <hi>Marcus</hi> vpon the passage of the Riuer, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with three thousand Foote and fiue hundred Horse, to the end hee
might succour his Companions being in the Riuer: hee himselfe past
with the rest of his Army, holding his intention secret from all
the World. Hee resolued things which he did not impart to many
men. His resolution was to lay siege to the City of <hi>Carthage</hi> scitnate
in <hi>Spaine,</hi> by the way of course: The which euery man might vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
and that it is an excellent presumption of his esteeme, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
of I haue formerly spoken. For as hee was but seuen and twenty
yeares old, he gaue himselfe first to things which in the iudgement
of the World seemed desperate, for the great precedent dangers and
misfortunes: leauing all things that were vulgar and easie: and resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
and attempted those which seemed impossible vnto the Enemie,
euery one of which required an exact wisedome, knowledge, and
vnderstanding.</p>
            <p>In the beginning being yet at <hi>Rome,</hi> when hee had considered by
himselfe, and eniquired diligently of the treason of the <hi>Celtiberians,</hi> and
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:16537:188"/>
of the diuision in the Armies, what might happen, and what fortune
had befalne his Father, he was nothing amazed at the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
neither did he faint as many vsually doe. But after that he vnderstood
that the Allies on this side the Riuer of <hi>Ebro,</hi> continued constant in
their Friendship, and that the Commanders of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
were in discord, and opprest the Subiects, hee affected the Warre
with an assured courage, hauing no confidence in Fortune, but in wise
Councell. When he arriued in <hi>Spaine,</hi> he moued them all, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
enquired of the Enemies actions, he vnderstood that the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi>
Armies were diuided into three: and that <hi>Mago</hi> made his
abode within the Pillars of <hi>Hercules,</hi> at certaine places called <hi>Conies:</hi>
And that <hi>Asdrubal</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Scone,</hi> was neare the mouth of a
Riuer by <hi>Portugale;</hi> the other <hi>Asdrubal</hi> in the <hi>Carpentins</hi> Countrey
held a City besieged: Either of which places were many dayes iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
distant from the City of the <hi>Ceneteins.</hi> Studying then whether
he should resolue to giue Battaile vnto the Enemy, if it were against
all their forces, he should be in danger to be defeated, as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of that which had befalne his Predecessors, as for that their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
were great. If likewise he labourd to fight with the one, it
was to be feared that in flying the Battaile, the other Armies would
come, and by this meanes hee should be inclosed, falling into the like
Disasters, whereunto his Vncle <hi>Caius</hi> and his Father <hi>Publius</hi> had
beene subiect.</p>
            <p>Wherefore leauing this aduice, when he vnderstood that <hi>Carthage</hi>
was a great ease vnto the Enemies, and would be a great annoyance to
him in this Warre, he considere of euery thing, wintring among the
<hi>Eilotes.</hi> When he was aduertised in the beginning that it had Ports
which might containe all the Sea-army of <hi>Spaine:</hi> hauing likewise a
Maritine scituation, spacious and commodious for the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
for the Nauigation which comes from <hi>Lybia:</hi> and likewise for that the
Treasure and Baggage for the Army, with all the hostages of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
were kept there: adding thereunto the great aduantage, for that the Fort
had not aboue a thousand Souldiers in Garrison, for that they neuer sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
that any man would presume to besiege it, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a manner Maisters of all <hi>Spaine:</hi> and that finally the rest of the
people are in great number, yet they were Artizans, Mech annickes
and Fishermen, who had no great experience in the Warre: He imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that his comming to this City would be vnexpected with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
He was not ignorant of the scituation of the Towne, nor of its
fortification, nor likewise of the disposition of the Poole: which things
he had learned from Fishermen which had frequented the place: This
Poole was generally muddy, and yet wadeable for the most part:
and withall the water retired daily about Sun-setting. Wherefore
concluding that if he preuailed in his Enterprize, he should not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
annoy the Enemy, but it would bee a great benefit for the Warre:
And if his aduice and councell succeeded well, hee might preserue
his Subiects as Maister of the Sea, if he might once fortifie and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
his Army. The which was easie: for that the Enemies were far off.
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:16537:188"/>
Leauing therefore all other resolutions, hee attends this during
Winter.</p>
            <p>And when he had once resolued, being of the age we haue mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
he concealed his resolution from all the World, (except to <hi>Caius
Lelyus</hi>) vntill he thought it fit to manifest it. Although that Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ographers
giue testimony of this resolution, yet when they come to
the end of the action, they attribute this excellent worke to the Gods
and to Fortune, and not to him nor his wisedome; without any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
arguments, and the testimony of those which liued with him:
for that <hi>Scipio</hi> himselfe declares plainely in an Epistle which he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to <hi>Philip,</hi> that making vse of the aduice which wee haue mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
he had vndertaken the Warre of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the siege of <hi>Carthage.</hi>
Moreouer, commanding <hi>Lelyus</hi> secretly touching the Army at Sea, he
gaue him charge to saile aboue the City. Hee alone was priuy to his
designe, as I haue sayd. Himselfe taking the Troupes of Foote-men,
marcht speedily. There were in the Army at Land about fiue and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thousand Foote, and two thousand fiue hundred Horse.<note place="margin">The number of <hi>Scipio's</hi> Army at Land.</note> Being
come vnto the City on the seuenth Day, hee planted his Campe on
the North part,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Carthage</hi> besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note> and fortified it without with a double Rampire and
Ditches from one Sea vnto the other, without doing any thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the City. The Nature of the place had fortification enough.</p>
            <p>To vnderstand well how this City hath beene besieged and taken, I
hold it necessary in some sort to describe the neighbour Countries and
its scituation.<note place="margin">The scituation of <hi>Carthage.</hi>
               </note> It is seated in <hi>Spaine</hi> about the middle of the Maritine
Region, in the Gulfe which hath its aspect towards <hi>Affricke:</hi> whose
depth is about twenty furlongs, and the breadth at the entrance about
ten: All this Gulfe makes a kind of Port, where there lies an I and
at the mouth of it, leauing on either side a little entrance. And when
the Sea is troubled with any torment, then all the Gulfe is calme,
but when the Westerne Winds of the Winter Solstice, beating vpon
the two entrances, cause the storme: But as for other Winds it
is not troubled, by reason of the firme Land which enuirons it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
the Gulfe there rises a Cape, whereon the City is scituated, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed
with the Sea towards the East and South, and with a Lake vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the West and North, so as the space which remaines from one
Sea to another, by the which the City is ioyned to the firme Land,
is not aboue two Furlongs.</p>
            <p>In regard of the City, one moiety of it is concaue: and towards the
South it hath the approach of the full Sea: Finally, it is full of Hills,
whereof two are rough and difficult: the other three are very lowe,
but strong and hard to passe, whereof the highest bends towards the
East, aduancing to the Sea: There the Temple of <hi>Asclepie</hi> is built.
Right against the which is another of the same scituation, whereon
stands a sumptuous royall Pallace, the which some say had beene
built by <hi>Asdrubal</hi> affecting a Regall power. The rest of the lesser
Hills haue their tops towards the North. That of the three which
lookes directly towards the East, is called <hi>Phoste:</hi> to the which is
ioyned that of <hi>Alete.</hi> It seemes that <hi>Pheste</hi> hath beene the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentor
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:16537:189"/>
of Siluer mettals, and for this cause purchased diuine honours,
The third is called <hi>Croue.</hi> In regard of the Lake ioyning to the Sea: it
hath taken its course by the worke of man, for the benefit of Fisher-men,
and others trafficking by Sea. But at the breach of the Banke by the
which the Lake and Sea are diuided, they haue made a Bridge, to the
end that Sumpters and Carts might bring things necessary from the
Countrey.</p>
            <p>This was the scituation of those places, the <hi>Romans</hi> Campe was forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in Front, without any prouision as well by the Lake, as Sea on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side. In regard of the space which ioynes the City to the firme
Land, he did not fortifie it, for that it was in the midst of his Campe:
to the end he might amaze the Citizens, and make vse of it for Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes,
and to sally forth and retire to his Campe. The Walles in the
beginning had not aboue twenty Furlongs: Although that many haue
giuen it forty: which is not true. Wee spake not by heare-say, but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a certaine knowledge, for that we haue seene the places: and at this
day they containe no more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scipio</hi> hauing drawne his Army together with that at Sea, began to
make remonstrances vnto them, without vsing any other arguments and
reasons, then simply to propound the things whereof wee haue partly
spoken, and shewing them that this attempt was feazable: and in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in particular things done by prowesse, he extenuated that of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.
Finally, he promised Crownes of Gold to those which should
first ascend the Wall: and the accustomed rewards to others which
should carry themselues openly like braue and valiant men. And in the
meane time he affirmes that <hi>Neptune</hi> had appeared vnto him in sleepe,
and had shewed him this kind of attempt to assaile the City: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
promised, that during the assault, he would worke so apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as the efficacy of his Succours should be manifest to the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
By his remonstrances and euident reasons, together with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of Crownes of Gold, and moreouer by the prouidence of God,
he imprinted a vehement desire and courage in the Youth.</p>
            <p>The next day hee drew his ships into the Maritine places, furnished
with diuers Engines to cast, whereof he gaue the charge to <hi>Caius Lely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us:</hi>
And taking at Land two thousand able men with those that carried
Ladders, he began the assault three houres after. <hi>Mago</hi> on the other
side who had the guard of the City, diuiding his Battalion of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men, leauing the one halfe within the Fort, and plants himselfe on
the Hill which lookes towards the East: and appoints about two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
strong men, furnished with Armes which were in the City, to the
Gate which drawes to the <hi>Isthmus,</hi> and the Enemies Campe: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
the rest to runne vp and downe the Walles, and to defend
them with all their power. When as <hi>Publius Scipio</hi> had caused the
Trumpet to found to the assault,<note place="margin">The beginning of the fight for <hi>Carthagena.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Mago</hi> caused a sally to be made by the
Gate, hoping to terrifie the Enemies, and to frustrate their attempt. As
they fought valiantly with those that came marching in Battaile to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Isthmus,</hi> there was a braue Combate, euery man giuing cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to his Companion. But the attempt was not equall, for that their
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:16537:189"/>
Succours were not alike: For that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> came running forth
but by one Gate, within the space of two Furlongs: whereas the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
came suddainly and from many places. <hi>Scipio</hi> restrained his men
neare the Campe, to drawe the Enemy farre from the City, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
that if he defeated this Battalion of Commons, he should subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
defeare the rest, and that no man would dare to make a sally.
It fell our that the Combate was for a time equall: for that on either
side they had made choise of their ablest men to make the point.<note place="margin">The <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> repuls'd.</note> But
in the end the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> being repuls'd by the force of those which
came running from the Campe, turne head: so as many were slaine du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Combate and retreate. There were many likewise slaine at
the Gate.</p>
            <p>After this all the people of the City were so amazed, as they which
were on the Walles fled: and the <hi>Romans</hi> had like to haue entred with
the Run-awayes. Moreouer, they set vp the Ladders diligently,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Carthage</hi> assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
               </note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<hi>Scipio</hi> vndertooke the danger: the which he did wisely. He was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with three men carrying Targets, (the which couering
<hi>Scipio,</hi> hindred the fight from the top of the Wall) defended him thus
couered. By this meanes striuing vpon the flankes and difficult places,
he was of great vse in taking this City. When he saw what was done,
being also discouered to all the Souldiers fighting, he gaue them great
courage, so as no danger was auoided: and hee imployed himselfe
cheerefully with the rest (as it was reasonable) in euery occasion that
was offered to purpose. When the first ascended the Ladders resolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the multitude of Defendants did not make the assault so dangerous,
as the height of the Walles. For this cause they which defended it,
were more assured seeing the difficult which happened. For some of
the Ladders brake by reason of the multitudes which mounted on them.
They also which ascended first, were so dazeled with the height of
the Ladders, as if the resistance and defence had beene any thing,
they must haue cast themselues downe headlong: And when as any
such accident happened, striuing to get ouer the Wall, they were
ouerthrowne to the ground. And although such things happened, yet
they could not repulse the <hi>Romans</hi> from their assault: so as when the first
were fallen, their next neighbours stept into their places.</p>
            <p>But as the day was farre spent, and the Souldiers tired with the toile
of the assault, the Commander caused a retreate to be sounded. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they of the City reioyced as if they had repuls'd the danger. But
<hi>Scipio</hi> attending the time when the Tide should retire, appointed fiue
hundred men for the Lake with Ladders. In regard of the Gate and
<hi>Isthmus,</hi> he set fresh men: and after that he had preacht vnto them, he
deliuered them more Ladders then formerly, to the end they might
mount vpon the Walles more thicke.<note place="margin">A second as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault giuen to <hi>Carthage</hi> by the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </note> When they had sounded to the
assault, and that the Souldiers went vp the Ladders with great courage,
there grew a great trouble and alteration in the City. For when they
thought they had beene free, they saw the danger renewed by another
assault. But when they found themselues destitute of Darts, and were
heauy for the great number of those which perished, they were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:16537:190"/>
at that which happened, yet defending themselues no lesse
valiantly. Finally, the ebbing of the Sea beganne during the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
of the Ladders: The height of the Poole was much diminished,
by the ebbing of the Tide, the which was great, falling by the mouth
into the Sea, so as it seemed incredible to those which saw it without
consideration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scipio</hi> hauing his guides ready, commaunds those which he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
to enter and to carrie themselues valianty. Hee was as fit
and industrious as any man, to put courage into his Souldiers, and to
make them resolute to whom he preacht. When they obeyed him, and
striued thorough the mud, all the Army held that which happened to
be done by some Diuine prouidence. Wherefore remembring those
things which they had heard, and the prowesse of <hi>Scipio,</hi> they were
so inflamed, as they drew to the Gate close and with a violent course,
and seeke to breake it open with Hatchets and Axes. The others ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
the VValls through the mud, and finding the toppe nakeed of
men, they set vp their Ladders not onely without danger, but they
past the Wals without difficultie. The Citizens in truth were drawne
to other places, neither did they thinke that the Enemy would euer
assaile the Wall by the Lake. Moreouer by reason of the extreame crie
and the confused noise, they could neither see nor heare any thing that
was done.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> hauing gotten the VVall, seeke first vnder colour of
making the round,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Carthagena</hi> ts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by assault.</note> how they might draw the Enemies vnto them. For
the effecting whereof their Armes was of great seruice. Finally, they
come to the Gate, where as some going downe cut the barres, others
entered from without. In regard of those which made their attempts
at the <hi>Isthmus</hi> with Ladders, after they had defeated them which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
the VValls, they lept ouer, and by this meanes the VVall was
gotten. As for the Hill scituated towards the East, they which entred
by the Gate recouered it, chasing away the Guards. VVhen as <hi>Scipio</hi>
saw that there was a sufficient number entred into the City, hee sent
many of them according to the Custome, against the Citizens, giuing
them charge to kill all they met without taking any to mercy, and
not to busie themselues with spoile vntill they had a signe giuen them.
The <hi>Romans</hi> doe this to terrifie them. And therefore wee often see,
that when they take Cities by force, they doe not onely kill the men,
but they cut their Dogges in pieces, and dismember their other Cattle.
Many such things happened in that Citie, by reason of the multitude
of Prisoners.</p>

in the Campe ordained for that end: And the Generall spent the

<pb n="365" facs="tcp:16537:190"/>
rest being retired from the Houses, by the Captaines of Thousands, to
carry the booty to the Ensignes in the market place. In regard of them
that were lightly armed, called from the Campe on the Hill, hee sent
them to the Easterne parts. The <hi>Romans</hi> tooke <hi>Carthage</hi> in <hi>Spaine</hi>
after this manner. The day following after they had carried the bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Souldiers, and the substance of the Burgesses

Sometimes to euery day they number the men, and distributing them
according to the greatnesse of the City, sometimes they diuide them
by Ensignes. They neuer appoint aboue halfe the Army for this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
The rest remaine in Battaile for the Guard, sometimes they
are without, and sometimes within the City, vnto the end
they may be alwayes ready. The Army being diuided for the most
part in two of <hi>Romans,</hi> and two of Allies, they which are deputed
for the diuision, do euery man bring his booty vnto the Campe. This
done, the Millaneers or Captaines of Thousands diuide it equally to
them all: Not onely to those which remaine in Battaile, but also to
the Guards of the Tents, to the sicke, and vnto all those which are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
for any publicke seruice.</p>
            <p>When they are together in Campe to go vnto the War,<note place="margin">The Souldiers Oath touching the pillage.</note> they sweare
not to commit any fraud in the pillage, and that they keepe their faith
according vnto the oath which they haue taken. But wee haue spoken
sufficiently heere of in Discoursing of their pollicy. Finally when an
Army is thus diuided, one part attending the Booty, and the rest stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Battaile for their Guards, yet the <hi>Romans</hi> had neuer any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
through Couetousnesse. For when as none of them are frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the Hope of gaine, and that in the meane time some follow
the spoile, and the others remaining in Battaile guard them, no man
abandons his Ensigne: The which many times is the cause of great
losse and danger to others. Many suffer losse, and are in danger in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of gaine: For it is apparent, that they which remaine in Campe,
or are in Battaile, containe themselues vnwillingly: for that most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
all the spoile vnder his Commaund and power which rules, if
he be an absolute Monarch: And if he be a Commaunder, euery man
holds that his owne, which may be hidden and purloin'd, although
that all things be carefully brought together. And for that most part
of men desire booty, and for this cause are in danger, hauing no
meanes to obtaine an absolute Victory, it fals out that they are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to lose all. The which happens to many, who although they haue
preuailed in their Enterprize, whether they haue cast themselues into
the Enemies Campe, or haue taken a City, yet they haue not onely
beene repuls'd, but moreouer had lost all, and for no other cause but
that aboue mentioned. Whereefor Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manders ought to haue nothing
in greater recommendation and care, then that where of wee speake:
which is, that (as much as may be possible) this hope may remaine to
the greatest part: that if such an accident happens, the diuision may be

equall to them all. Then the Captaines of Thousands gaue order <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Prisoners, (which were little lesse then a thousand) hee commands
them first to separate the Citizens with their Wiues and Children, and

which they receiued, and then hee sent them backe to their houses.
Whereof some weeping, and others ioyfull for their vnexpected safety,
they retire, hauing done their duties to the Generall.</p>
            <p>In regard of the Worke-men and Artizans, hee told them, that for
the present they were publique Seruants to the City of <hi>Rome:</hi> But if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery

if the Warre vndertaken against the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had a good
end. Then he gaue charge to the Questor to take the Names of these
men, and that he should appoint thirty <hi>Roman</hi> Commissaries, for the
whole multitude contained in a manner two thousand. He also made
choise of the strongest, and the most flourishing in age and forme, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
the Troupes: and fill'd the captiue ships with all the Marriners,
exceeding the former one halfe: so as euery ship had in a manner twice
as many men.<note place="margin">The number of ships that were taken.</note> There were eighteene captiue ships, and in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
they had beene fiue and thirty. To whom he promised liberty if
they shewed themselues friends and valiant, and that if in this Warre
he should happen to vanquish the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> When he had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
himselfe in this manner, he made the Burgesses affectionate and
loyall, as well to himselfe as to the <hi>Roman</hi> Common-weale: The
Worke-men and Artizans are in like manner ioyfull vpon the hope of
liberty.</p>
            <p>But when he had by this supply much augmented the Troupes, in the
end he separates <hi>Mago</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> For he had two Senators
and fifteene Councellors: whom hee gaue in charge to <hi>Caius Lelyus,</hi>
commanding him to haue a speciall care. Moreouer, hee calls all the
hostages vnto him, which were aboue three hundred. Then he makes
much of the Children, willing them to reioyce, and that within few
dayes they should see their Parents. In like manner he perswades the
rest to be of good hope, and to write vnto their Cities and Friends, that
first of all they had their liues saued, and were well intreated: And that
secondly the <hi>Romans</hi> would send them all home to their houses in safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
if their Friends could imbrace their alliance. This Speech being
ended, he gaue the most commodious spoiles of the Army to euery one
according to his Race and age, as to Children Feathers and Bracelets,
and to young men Swords. When as among the Captiues the Wife of
<hi>Mandonin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Wife of <hi>Mandonin.</hi>
               </note> the Brother of <hi>Andobale,</hi> King of the <hi>Lecheteins,</hi> had cast her
selfe at his feete, demanding with teares that he would haue a better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to her honesty then the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had had, being moued
with compassion, he demanded of her what necessary things she wanted.
Shee was an aged woman, and carried the shew of some great Dignity.
And when she held her peace, he calls for those which had the charge
of the women, who presenting themselues, and affirming that the
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:16537:191"/>
               <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had furnished the Women with all things necessary: she
touching his knees againe, repeared the same words. <hi>Scipio</hi> viewing
her, and thinking that they vnto whom he had then giuen the charge,
shewed themselues lyers through negligence, commaunded the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
not to be discontented, and that hee would giue order to place o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Commissaries, to the end nothing should be wanting that was
needfull for them. Then staying a little, Captaine she said, thou mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takest
my words, if thou doest thinke that I require thy assistance to
content the bellie.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Scipio</hi> hearing her conceite, and obseruing in her face the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of <hi>Andobales</hi> daughters, and of many other Potentates, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to weep; for that this Lady discouered her Calamitie in few words.
Wherefore when it appeared that he vnderstood her conceit, taking her
by the Hand, as he did the rest, willing them to reioyce: promising
to haue them in as great recommendation, as his owne sisters and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
and that according to his promise, hee would appoint trusty and
confident men to haue the Charge ouer them. Finally, hauing deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto the Questors all the Wealth found in the publicke Treasure of
the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> which amounted to aboue eighteene hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Crownes: So as ioyning them vnto other twelue hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
which the Questor of <hi>Rome</hi> had, the whole summe would be aboue
three millions.</p>
            <p>At the same time certaine Young men hauing taken a Virgin, passing
in the flower of her age, and the beauty of her body all the rest of the
Women, knowing that <hi>Scipio</hi> tooke delight in it, they came vnto him
bringing this Virgin, and staying him, told him that they presented her
vnto him. <hi>Publius</hi> amazed and-wondring at her beauty: if I were
(sayth he) a priuate person, there is no gift could be more pleasing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me:<note place="margin">The chast an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere of <hi>Scipio.</hi>
               </note> But being a great Commaunder, there is nothing lesse in my
affection: Letting them vnderstand (as it feemes by this answere) that
in time of rest and idlenesse, the vse of such things is pleasing to young
men: But when affaires do presse, it ingenders in them which vse
them, great hinderances both in body and minde. Finally hee thankt
the young men: And calling for the father of the Virgin, hee restored
her vnto him, giuing him charge to marry her as he thought good, to
some Cittizen. By this meanes hauing made shew of the Chastity and
modesty of his Heart, he became very pleasing to the Subiects. These
things being thus ordained, and the rest of the Prisoners deliuered to
the Captaines of Thousands, hee sent <hi>Caius Lelyus</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> to the fiue
Yeares Sacrifices, with the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and the other prisoners of
note, to make knowne in their Countrey, the accidents which had
happened.</p>
            <p>Many in truth which despaired of the Warre in <hi>Spaine,</hi> applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
vnto the present in diuers manners, resuming Courage againe,
where as the newes was directed publickly. <hi>Scipio</hi> staying some time
at <hi>Carthage,</hi> practised the Army at Sea continually: And hee taught
the Captaines of Thousands this kinde of Exercise for the Foote-men.
He appointed the Souldiers to runne thirty furlongs armed on the first
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:16537:192"/>
day: And on the second they should all furbush and cleanse their armes:
And on the third they should rest:<note place="margin">Exercises ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi> for his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my both at Sen and Land.</note> But on the fourth they should fight
with Swords of Wood couered with Leather, and with plummets,
teaching them to cast Darts: And on the fift to fall to their running, as
in the beginning. In like manner he solicited the Artizans and Worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
carefully, to the end that nothing should bee wanting in the true
Exercises of Armes. He also appointed part of the Commissaries to
this Worke, and went vp and downe daily, soliciting euery man vnto
that which was necessary.</p>
            <p>Finally, whilst the Armie at Land practised often before the Citie,
the Marriners vsed their Exercises at Sea, with their turnings and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.
And they which should be in the Citie, should Furbush, Forge,
and Worke: and that all should be carefully imploied to prepare
Armes. There is no man but would haue held the City for a shoppe
of Warre, according to the saying of <hi>Xenophon,</hi> if he had seene it then.
As all things seemed good vnto him, and conueniently dispatcht for
necessary vse, and that consequently hee had put a Garrison into the
Citie, and rampred the Wals, he dislodgeth with his Army, as ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
both by Sea and Land towards <hi>Tarragone,</hi> hauing the Hostages
with him. He marcht with his Army, as in his iudgement such
marches are requisite in all occasions. In the which hee must alwayes
accustome the Horse-men, as to mannage a Horse, to handle a Iaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,
and moreouer to bound and gallop, and to turne on the right
hand or the left. Sometimes they disbanded the Commanders of ten
out of the midst of the Army, and they which commaunded twenty
vpon the two wings: and sometimes they drew them together, and
stayed them according to the troupes of horsemen vpon the wings:
or else they made an extent of two wings by an interposition, or by
the pollicy of the Captaines of the reareward. In regard of their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
in a throng, hee sayed it was not necessary, as hauing one
course vpon the way.</p>
            <p>They must in all alarums bee accustomed to charge the enemy, and
to make their retreate, that they should alwayes approach as nimbly as
they could, marching vnited and in the same order. They must more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
obserue the spaces betwixt the bands, for if the horsemen
vndergoing the danger breake their rankes, there was nothing so
dangerous nor preiudiciall. When hee had taught them all these
things, especially to the Captaines, hee enters into Citties, to inquire
first if most of them obeyed the things which had beene comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them, and finally if they which had the gouerment of Citties,
were sufficient to execute the constitutions with iudgement: holding
nothing more necessary then the Prudence of Gouernors. These
things being thus ordred, hee assembles the horsemen of Citties
in a certaine place, and himselfe making certaine bounds and
Curuets, hee taught them all the managing of Armes. Hee did
not march in the head of the army, as Captaines vsually doe
at this day, thinking the first place to belong vnto them. This without
doubt takes away the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manders experience, and draws him into danger
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:16537:192"/>
It is true that he is seene by them all, but sees not any.<note place="margin">The duty of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> It is necessary
that the Commander of an Army shew example, not by a Military
authority, but by experience of a Captaine, and his prowesse in
Armes, marching sometimes with the fore-ward, and sometimes with
the reare-ward, and sometimes in the Battaile: the which this man did,
riding and considering them all, who being doubtfull hee taught, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
their errours in the beginning: the which seldome happened
by reason of the precedent diligence. <hi>Demetrius Phalerius</hi> hath shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, saying, that as in buildings where the houses are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vnder one Roofe and ligature, it happens that the continuance
is the stronger: So a whole Army is made more firme, in the which
all is diligently pursued in particular, and by the Chambers. That
which is done at this day, is very like to the gouernment and order
of a Battaile. Light things and those which are most vsuall in an
Army, many times perish wholly in it. In regard of the Role of
those which disband, and are armed with aduantage, the Battalion
containes them. Now the <hi>Etoliens</hi> fight like a forlorne hope: So
doe they of <hi>Morea</hi> their Allies: whereas the <hi>Romans</hi> make head
holding the order of a Battalion. And if the others bee repulst,
and returning from the Combate perish, the <hi>Romans</hi> retire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
losse: and if they vanquish, which God forbid) they will make
all the rest of <hi>Greece</hi> subiect.</p>

time as the <hi>Persians</hi> enioyed <hi>Asia,</hi> this Countrey had in certaine places
(In the which formerly there was no Water) fiue Springs or Fountains.
And therefore as <hi>Tauris</hi> hath many great Riuers, they imployed great

               </p>
               <p>But when he was come to <hi>Tages,</hi> and had notice of the difficulty
of the places by those of the Countrey, the which hee was to passe

to informe euery one of them how to performe the way, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
hee appointed Pyoners, marching with them to leuell the way
for the Souldiers, Leginaries, and Baggage. This being concluded,
he gaue the first Battalion to <hi>Diogenes,</hi> adding thereunto the Archers
and Slingers, who from the Mountaines might cast their Darts and
Stones: the which held no order of Battaile, but came alwayes in
time to the place of danger, and were of great seruice in difficult pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Hee accompanied them with about two thousand <hi>Candiots</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with Targets, of which <hi>Polixenides</hi> had the charge. In the
Reareward hee ordaines the armed men and the Targeteers: The

               </p>
               <p>As these men march before, it fell out that the roughnesse and
streights of the passage were found more difficult then the King had
conceiued. All the length of the ascent was about three hundred
Furlongs, and for the most part by the deepe Fourd of a Torrent, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the which were fallen from the high Rocks Stones and Trees
which made the passage inaccessible. To the which the <hi>Barbarians</hi> gaue
great assistance: casting continually Trees which were cut downe, and
gathered together great heapes of Stones: and seazed (keeping with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
the length of all the Valley) on the Hills of aduantage, which
might serue them for defence: so as if they had not beene frustrated,
<hi>Antiochus</hi> had giuen ouer his Enterprize as destitute of his forces.
For as it was necessary for the Enemies to take their way, and to

great number.</p>
               <p>By this meanes when the Slingers, Archers, and Darters had marcht
to the higher places, scattred here and there, and sometimes together,
seazing on the most commodious places, and the Targeteers held the
lower Countrey, marching in Battaile a flow pace along the Torrent:
The <hi>Barbarians</hi> stayed not, but abandoning the place, they drew toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on the top of the Mountaines. In regard of <hi>Antiochus</hi> Troupes,
it past the difficult passages safely after this manner: But slowly and
with great difficulty: They could hardly eight in a Ranke recouer the
top of the neare Mountaines. And when the <hi>Barbarians</hi> were there
assembled, hauing an humour they should bee able to keepe the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
from gaining the top, there fell out a braue Combate. By these
reasons the Enemies were repuls'd, who revniting themselues fought
against the Leginaries, and made head against them with great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and vallour.</p>
               <p>In the Night the brauest of them turning about recouered the top,
and the places lying behind. The which the <hi>Barbarians</hi> seeing, and
suddainly amazed, they turned head. The King is very carefull to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine

make platformes in the fashion of a Tortoise. The Ditches were
triple, being about seuen Fathome and a halfe broad, and foure deepe.
Vpon either banke there was a double Pallisadoe with a strong out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall.
There were continuall Skirmishes whilest they wrought: from
whence they carried from either side men slaine and hurt: for that
they fought very valiantly, not onely vpon the ground, but also vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it in the Mines. But by reason of the multitude of Pyoners and
the Kings diligence, it happened that the Ditches were suddainly
fill'd vp, and the Walles fell being shaken with the Mines. This
done, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> being confounded, and much terrified and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed

wounded to flye into Caues and Pits. The which they of the Campe
seeing, they could not relieue them in this danger. For whilest they
cryed out and wondred at this accident, and that some bridled their
Horses, and others arm'd themselues, the Execution was ended. The
Sonne of <hi>Claudius</hi> saued himselfe with difficulty, and contrary to all

               <p>For my part I am forced to admonish the Reader of these kind of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures
through the whole tract of our Worke, where I see not onely
ordinary Souldiers, but euen Captaines themselues to haue erred by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
ignorance. What profit can a Prince or Commander reape, which
hath not the knowledge of dangers which hee must auoide, lest the
whole Army perish with him? Who knowes not that if necessity doth
force them to attempt a thing, that a great part of the Troupes must
perish before the Commanders feele it? The tryall must be suddainly
made not by the Commander.<note place="margin">Common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.</note> That which they vsually say, I did not
thinke it: and who would euer haue thought that should haue hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened?
Seemes to be a great argument of ignorance, and of a weake
iudgement in the Commander.</p>
               <p>For this cause I hold <hi>Hannibal</hi> among the good Captaines for many
reasons, and which may herein be commended, who hath imployed
much time in the profession of Armes, and who making vse of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in many and diuers occasions, hath many times by his industry
frustrated the Enemies in particular encounters, and was neuer circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented
in such great Battailes: who as it appeares hath preserued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
with great prouidence. And that with good reason. For the
Commander being safe, although all the rest perish. Fortune produceth
many occasions by the which the damages receiued by those miserable
accidents may be repaired: But if he perish like vnto a Pilot in a ship,
there growes no profit, although that Fortune giue the Victory to the
rest against the Enemy: For that the hope of all depends vpon the
Commander. I speake these things against those who by a glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
or a youthfull humour, or by stupidity, or disdaine, fall into
this inconsideration. One of the said things must of necessity be the
cause of these misfortunes.</p>

in the Region of <hi>Tarracona,</hi> had first drawne the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
to his Friendship, and made them faithfull, for that
he had restored them their hostages, he had in this action
<hi>Edecon,</hi> a powerfull Prince for a voluntary assistance: who

vnder the power of <hi>Publius,</hi> considering the alteration of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>

beleeuing confidently that by this meanes he might recouer his Wife
and Children, and that hee should seeme to ioyne vnto the <hi>Romans</hi>
willingly, and not through necessity: The which succeeded according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
For when the Army had beene newly sent to winter, he came to
<hi>Tarracona</hi> accompanied with his Friends.</p>
               <p>Being admitted to the speech of <hi>Publius,</hi>

the rest, some sent and depended on the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and in the
meane time they sued vnto the <hi>Romans</hi> with ioyned hands: and that for
his part he was come not onely to yeeld himselfe but also his Friends.
Wherefore if he receiued him into his Friendship and alliance, he was
confident that he should be able, not onely for the present, but also for
the future to doe him great seruice. For as soone as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> should
see him admitted to his Friendship, and to haue obtained his demands,
they will likewise come all to recouer their Friends, and to purchase
the alliance of the <hi>Romans:</hi> and that for the future they would imploy
themselues with emulation in his other affaires, if their hearts were
once possest with this honour and humanity. He required to haue his
Wife and Children, and that being admitted into Friendship, he might
returne to his house, where hauing found some good occasion, hee
might shew his affection, and that of his Friends towards him and the
<hi>Roman</hi> Common-weale. This Speech being ended. <hi>Edecon</hi> was silent.
As <hi>Publius</hi> had long expected this, and considered of <hi>Edecons</hi> reasons,
he deliuered him his Wife and Children, granting the alliance. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:16537:195"/>
during his presence, he drawes the Spaniard by many meanes to
his Deuotion, and imprinted in his followers a great hope for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
sending him backe to his House. When this accident was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged,
all the Spaniards inhabiting within the Riuer (being former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
no friends to the <hi>Romans</hi>) followed their party in a manner with one
accord. These things fell out to the content of <hi>Publius Scipio.</hi> After
their departure hee sent backe the maritine Bands, seeing no shewe of
danger at Sea. Yet he made choise of those that were most seruicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and diuides them among the Ensignes, to the end he might make

in their hearts against the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> although they helde
them for their trusty and confident friends: For that <hi>Asdrubals</hi> men
(making shew to haue no great confidence in them) they had exacted a
great summe of money, and their Wiues and Children for Hostages,
whereof wee haue formerly spoken. When as then they immagined
they had found a fit opportunity, they retire their Bands from the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi>
Campe, and in the Night recouered certaine places of great
strength, where they might remaine free from all danger. This done,
many other Spaniards abandoned <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> hauing beene long dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented

               <p>You must vnderstand that the Execution of great matters, and a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory

there is required great prudence and Wisedome, to make good vse of
things decided by Armes. So as there are more that enioy Prerogatiues,
then they which vse them well: The which happened to the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>

now Treat, thinking that <hi>Spaine</hi> was then in no more danger of Warre,
they intreated the Inhabitants roughly. For this cause in steed of friends
and Allies, their Subiects were incensed and deadly Enemies. The
which fell out iustly. They had an humour that the meanes to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
Principallities, diffred from that of preseruing them. They were
ignorant that they keepe their preheminence well, which obserue the
same will and humour, wherewith principallities haue beene first
Conquered.</p>
               <p>It is manifest and obserued in many, that men are of that Nature, that
whereas prosperity offers it selfe, they shewe themselues kinde to their
Neighbours, promising hopefull things. But when they haue attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to their desires, then they deale wickedly, and raigne ouer their
Subiects as ouer flaues. Wherefore not without reason the affections
of Subiects, change with the alteration of their Princes: The which
hapned to the <hi>Carthaginians. Asdrubal</hi> takes much aduice vpon this
accident for the euent of things. The retreate of <hi>Andomale</hi> troubled
him. So did the hatred and abandoning of the other Commaunders.
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:16537:196"/>
Finally, hee was discontented at the comming of <hi>Publius,</hi> whom hee
still expected to come against him with his Army. When he saw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
abandoned by the Spaniards, and that all in one League retired
to the <hi>Romans,</hi>

and from thence with a multitude of <hi>Barbarians</hi> draw into <hi>Italy,</hi>
and ioyne with his brother <hi>Hannibal</hi> vnder the same hope. <hi>Asdrubal</hi>
being of this aduise prepares himselfe. <hi>Publius</hi> hauing receiued <hi>Caius

retired his Army out of the Garrisons: To whom the Spaniards come
at the passage, and march with him with willing and ioyfull hearts.

to vnderstand what seruice and loyalty hee had obserued towards him;
and finally he exposeth the outrages and iniuries which hee and his had
suffered, intreating him to be the Iudge of that which he sayd: And
if he seemed to accuse the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> vniustly, hee might certainly

rather into the estate of Captives and slaues, then Hostages, hee hath
kept them with such honesty, as the Parents themselues could not haue
done. And when as <hi>Andobale</hi> and his Company confest it, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

he had the riuer at his backe in manner of a Rampire: and in front and
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:16537:196"/>
on the sides a Pallisadoe with a sufficient depth for the Fortification:
there was finally a length in the Vallies sufficient to put them in battaile.
And as for the side of the Hill there were vsually men. When as <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
approacht, he was ready to hazard the Combate: although hee
were in doubt seeing the aduantage and force of the places, where the
Enemy lay in Campe. But when he had contained himselfe two daies,
and was in feare that <hi>Mago</hi> and <hi>Asdrubal</hi> the sonne of <hi>Gescon</hi> comming,
he might be inuironed round, he resolued to fight and to hazard a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile:
Making therefore another Army, he labours to gaine the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisado.
In regard of those that were lightly armed and the choise foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
he sends them to the side of a Hill, giuing them charge to assaile,
and to view the Enemies forces.</p>
               <p>And when that this was done with great Courage, the Commander
of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> attends the euent from the beginning. But when
he saw his men prest, and in danger by the courage of the <hi>Romans,</hi> he
drawes his Army into the field, and plants in neere the side of the Hill,
relying vpon the opportunitie of the place. At the same time <hi>Publius</hi>
sends his brauest men to succour those that were in danger; and stayed
the rest ready: He takes the one halfe and assailes the Hill vpon the left
side of the Enemy, fighting against the <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> And deliuers
the rest to <hi>Lelyus,</hi> giuing him charge to assaile the Enemy on the right
hand. When this was done, <hi>Asdrubal</hi> drawes his Army out of the
Fort.<note place="margin">The <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> assailed by the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                  </note> He had hitherto kept it, relying vpon the fortified places, hauing
an opinion that the Enemies durst not assaile him. But for that this
charge of the <hi>Romans</hi> came vnexpected, hee puts his Army into Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile

               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> vndergoing the danger of the fight, whilest that the
Enemies were not yet vpon the Wings, they not only assailed the Hill
without danger, but in approaching slew those which crost them,
whilest that the Enemies made ready their battaile: forcing those to
turne which prepared themselues and made head against them. When
as <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> according to his first resolution, saw his Army giue backe
and shamefully repuls'd, hee had no will to fight vnto the last gaspe.
Taking therefore the Treasure and the Elephants,<note place="margin">The defeate of <hi>Asdrubal.</hi>

hee would not accept of this will and humour of the Subiects. But he
will wonder much more at the excellency of his magnanimitie, if hee
lookes to the last daies of his life: when besides the valiant exploits
which hee hath done in <hi>Spaine,</hi> hee hath ruined the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and
made subiect vnto the <hi>Romans</hi> many good Countries in <hi>Lybia,</hi> from the
<hi>Philenin</hi> Altars, to the pillars of <hi>Hercules.</hi> Hee hath also ruined <hi>Asia,</hi>
and the <hi>Assirian</hi> Kings. Finally, hee hath reduced to the obedience of
the <hi>Romans</hi> the best and greatest part of the World. And therefore if
hee had pleased hee might well haue imbraced the opportunity to v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpe
a royall power, in these Countries which hee hath inuaded and
taken. The disdaine of such things (as <hi>Scipio</hi> hath wisely done) sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passeth
not onely humane nature, but a diuine. This magnanimity doth
so much excell other men, as no man would demaund of the Gods a
greater fauour: I meane then a Crowne, the which hee hath so often
refused, being deliuered vnto him by fortune, and hath had his Country
in more esteeme, and his owne honour then the great command of a
royall power. Hee gaue leaue to all the Spaniards, being set a part, to
returne into their Country without ransom, except three hundred horse
whereof hee gaue the choise to <hi>Andobale,</hi> giuing the rest to those which
had not any. Finally, being now seazed on the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> Campe,
hee stayed there in regard of the firtility of the Country, expecting the
<hi>Carthaginian</hi> Commanders which were remaining: hee also sent forces
to the topps of the <hi>Perenee</hi> Mountaines to watch <hi>Asdruball,</hi> and then
when the season was come hee retired to <hi>Tarracona,</hi> to winter his
Army there.</p>

promising them to doe what possibly hee could. His whole inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was the Warre, expecting by what meanes and against whom hee
should first beginne. But when the forces of <hi>Attalus</hi> were come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

giuing them charge to make him a signe by fire of all things
that should be done, vpon the <hi>Tisee</hi> which is a Mountaine in <hi>Thessaly,</hi>
which in regard of the places is very commodiously scituated. But as
this manner of signe by fire, is of great commodity for the Warre, and
hath formerly not beene vsed, I doe not hold it good to passe it, but in
this passage to make some reasonable mention. No man is ignorant
that opportunity and occasion are the principall parts in all things: But
much more in the profession of Warre, to bring enterprises to an end:
But among those things which are vsefull,<note place="margin">Aduertisements by fire.</note> fires are of great efficacy.
They vse them at this day, and are the cause of some opportunities, to
be able to aduertise him who hath the care of that which is done, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be three or foure dayes distant, or more: To the end that by
the signe of fire, they may suddainly giue succours vnto them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
it, although that in former times they haue held it of small mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for that the most part knew not how to vse it. But the vse
ought to bee ordered and setled vppon certaine and determinate agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
But whereas things which they will signifie are not resolutely
set downe, they cannot make vse of these fires, as those are whereof wee
will speake.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:16537:198"/>
If the Army at Sea were come to <hi>Orea,</hi> or <hi>Peparethon,</hi> or <hi>Chalcis,</hi>
they might signifie it to those, with whom this hath beene resolued.
But if any of the Cittizens will turne their Coates, or practise a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or Murther within the Citty, or any such thing as hath vsually hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and yet cannot be diuined (matters which happen suddainly and
vnlookt for, haue neede according to the occasion, of Counsell and
aide) yet it may be signified by fire. For of those which consideration
cannot preuent, they cannot make any Conclusion. <hi>Eneas</hi> seeking to
correct this kinde of doubt and perplexitie,<note place="margin">The aduise of <hi>Eneas</hi> touching signes by fire.</note> hath in few words made
the Commentaries, of the institution of the heads: And hath abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
comprehended for the vnderstanding, the summe of those things
which are required; the which may easily be discouered by this speech,
saying: That they which will giue notice by the aduertisement of fire
of any of great and pressing businesse, must make prouision of pots of
earth, whose breadth and depth must be equall, and they must haue
three foote in depth, and one and a halfe in breadth: Then hee must
make slender Corkes in the mouth of it; in the middest whereof hee
must tie them in equall parts of three fingers distant; and in euery part
a great Circumference, in the which are also painted the most vulgar
and generall things which happen in the profession of Warre. As by
the first, that Horse-men are suddainly entred the Countrie: In the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
that foote-men armed; in the third, that men lightly armed:
And consequently in others, that foote and Horse-men, or an Army
at Sea, and that there is Corne. You must in this sort paint the things
which do vsually happen in Regions, according to the prouidence and
time of the motions of Warre.</p>
               <p>This being done hee Commaunds to obserue dilligently the pots
of the one and the other, so as the pipes may bee equall and runne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually:
And when the pots shalbe full of Water, they must put in the
Corkes with stickes; and then let the pipes runne together. This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it is apparent, that all being equall, the Corkes of necessity abate
as the Water runnes, and the stickes hide themselues in the Vessells.
When these things are equally ordered, and they are to vse them, then
they must transport them to the places, where the one and the other
are to obserue the fires, and then must set them on either side vpon the
Vessels. Finally, in what thing soeuer that any portraite of the sticke
shall fall, hee ordaines they should set vp a light which must continue
vntill the Deputies answere him with the same. And when both fires
are discouered, then hee must take them away and suffer the pipes to
runne. But as for the falling of the Corke and the sticke, that which
of the Images shall approach vnto the brinke of the pot which wee
will let you see, hee orders that they shall set vp a light: and that they
should stoppe the pipes, and see what image of those which are figured
vpon the sticke, comes to the brinke.</p>
               <p>This may be done when as all the things which they manifest, are
of either side mooued with the same dilligence. The which may bee
in some sort by a light set vp by agreement to serue for an aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
vnlesse they be vndetermined: For it is impossible to see fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:16537:198"/>
things, or that that bee figured vpon the sticke which wee fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see.
Finally if by Fortune any vnexpected accident happens, it is
certaine that it cannot be declared by this inuention: Nor any thing of
that which is figured in the sticke be determined. They cannot giue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisement
of the number of Horse-men or of foot, or of ships, nor of
the quantitie of Corne. For wee cannot dispose of things, whereof the
knowledge cannot be made before they be done. And by consequence
how can any man resolue of succours, if he knowes not the multitude
of the Enemies,<note place="margin">Another kinds of aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by fire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented by <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocrites.</hi>
                  </note> and the place where they are? How can a man worke
safely, or otherwise? Or how can hee plot any Enterprize, which
knowes not the number of the Enemies, nor the quantity of Corne
which is come vnto them from their Allies?</p>
               <p>A latter kinde hath beene inuented by <hi>Cleomenes</hi> and <hi>Democrites.</hi> In
regard of that which is vulgar and of ready vse, we haue determined:
the which may aduertise exactly all that which is necessary to bee
knowne. The vse whereof requires dilligence, and an exact obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation;
and it is in this manner. You must diuide the Letters according
to their order in fiue parts, euery one consisting of fiue: But in the ende
there shall want one, which is no matter of Consequence. And when
as they which shall make vse of lights for an aduertisement, shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
fiue little Tables, and write vpon either of them the parties accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their order, and then they agree together, that hee which
giues the aduertisement, shall set vp the first lights and two together,
which shall not bee taken away vntill the other hath answered in like
manner. This serues to the end that by this light they may vnderstand,
that they are discouered. These others being taken away, they must
shew the first which are on the left hand, and declare by the Table the
things whereunto they must haue a care. As if the first Table he lifted
vp, it signifies one: if the second two; and so consequently. They must
also lift vp those which are on the right hand, after the same manner,
to aduertise what letters he shall write that takes the light. When they
which haue agreed together vpon these matter, come vnto the place,
they must first haue a Dioptre, hauing two Cauels: to the end that hee
that is to lift vp the light right against it, may see the place both on the
right hand and left.</p>
               <p>The Tables must bee fixed straight and by order, neere vnto the
Dioptre, and the places on the right hand and the left must bee separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ten foote, and the height of a man. Moreouer they must be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
that the lights may be visible when they set them vp, and likewise
hidden when they take them downe. These things being thus prepared
on eyther side, and that they haue an intent to giue some aduertisment,
as that a hundred Souldiers are retired to the Enemy, they must first
vse the Dictions which by the small Letters may signifie that which we
haue said;<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> as that a hundred <hi>(Candyots)</hi> haue abandoned vs. The letters
now are lesse, and yet that is signified. This which is written in the
Table will shewe it selfe thus. The first letter is thus <hi>x,</hi> the which is in
the second part and second Table: they must also set vp the lights vpon
the left hand, to the end that he which hath the charge, may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:16537:199"/>
that he must looke to the other Table. Then on the right hand
he must set vp fire, to let him know that thisx is the fifth Letter on the
right hand, the which hee which obserues the lights, must write in
the Table. Then<note place="margin">p. r.</note> p wherefore hee must lift vp two on the right hand,
which signifies the second of the fourth part: For this cause hee that
obserues the Lights, writes the letter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <note place="margin">p. r.</note> and so consequently of the rest.
By this meanes whatsoeuer happens, it may be certainly knowne, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
this inuention. Moreouer they must haue many lights, for that
there must be two to euery Letter. And if any one doth duly obserue
these things, which serue to this vse, that which is required may bee
done. Moreouer, they which make vse of these two inuentions, must
giue order when as they will vse them, to be able to giue full and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
signes. Whosoeuer pleaseth, may easily know in many kinds
how great soeuer the difference of the sayd things make shew of, and
which they haue beene accustomed to obserue. For many things not
onely difficult, but which seeme impossible hauing gotten the successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of time and custome, become most easie.</p>
               <p>There are many and diuers examples which deserue credite; but the
most excellent is that which happens in the Arte of reading. If any
one instructs a man without Experience, and not accustomed to read,
although hee be industrious, and that finally hee produceth an infant
bred vp to it, and that a Booke being giuen him hee appoints him to
read the Contents, it is manifest that the other will not belieue, that
hee can know first how hee may by the looking of it read euery letter,
know their powers, and how they ought to be ioyned; forth at either of
the said things require much time. Wherefore when he hath not artai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
this Art, and sees this little Boy continue with one breath fiue or
sixe lines, he would neuer easily beleeue, but that hee hath formerly
read the Booke. And if moreouer he hath a good pronunciation, and
obserues the points, aspirations, and pauses, he will not be perswaded
and beleeue no more:</p>
               <p>Wherefore wee must not disdaine any thing that is profitable, in
regard of the euident difficulty: But we must apply our selues to that
which makes all good things comprehensible to men, and namely in
those wherein most commonly the supreame safetie doth consist. Wee
haue vndertaken to speake these things, according vnto that which we
haue promised in the beginning. For wee haue said that all Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
haue so preuailed with vs, as for the most part they are metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall
Sciences. Wherefore it is a very profitable portion of a well
composed History.</p>

daies iourney of the Riuer, he marcht the two first slowly: And on the
third hauing fed his men, hee causes his Campe to march at the breake
of day: Then taking the Horse-men and his strongest souldiers, with
a thousand Targetteers, he makes hast in the night. Hee had vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
that the enemies Cauallery was at the guard of the Riuer in the
day time, but at night they retired to a City some twenty Furlongs off.

wherein <hi>Asdrubal</hi> trusting, he had charged the enemy on the left hand.
Wherefore as he was perplexed and in doubt, for that he lost time, hee
learned what he had to doe. Taking therefore the Souldiers of the
right wing, he goes beyond his Campe neere vnto a passage behind the
Battaile and on the left hand, and giues a charge vnto the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
neere vnto the wing where the Elephants had their station. At that
time the Victory wauered. For in truth the danger was equall of both

Hee was brother to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who vndertaking the Voyage of <hi>Italy,</hi>
gaue him the Conduct of the Warres of <hi>Spaine.</hi> And afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
practised by many encounters against the <hi>Romans,</hi> hee hath indured
many and variable Fortunes: And in this also that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
sent Commaunders to succeede him, hee alwaies carried himselfe like
a man worthy of his Father <hi>Barca,</hi> bearing vnto the ende like a man of
Courage all disgraces and losses. Wee haue declared these things in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the precedent. But now we will decide the last Combats, in
that which seemes worthy of Consideration.</p>
            <p>Seeing before our eyes many Kings and Commanders which hauing
great Combates concerning their whole estates, haue alwayes cast
their eyes vpon the most excellent Actions, and of Consequence; and
who often enquire and Discourse how they shall helpe themselues in
euery good Fortune: And who moreouer care not for mischances, not
consider of the meanes, nor that which they are to doe in euery action
and euent: For that this other is in their hands, and this requires a
great preparation. And therefore many hauing beene vanquished,
carry themselues poorely by their basenesse and inconsiderations: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that the Souldiers haue many times sought valiantly, and with
good direction: And haue by this meanes dishonoured their precedent
actions, making the rest of their Liues infamous. It is an easie thing
for him that will know how many Commaunders faile, and are fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
heerein, and that there is much difference betwixt man and
man. Precedent times haue affoorded many examples in these things.
In regard of <hi>Asdrubal</hi> he was no lesse prouident in dangers, then for his
safety, whilest he had any hope conformable to reason, to be able to
do any thing worthy of his Predecessours. But when as Fortune had
depriued him of all hope for the future, and had concluded him to his
last end: omitting nothing for the Victory, nor that which concerned
the preparation and danger, hee carried himselfe like a man of proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
And although that all was in danger, yet hee obeyed the present
time, neither did he suffer any thing vnworthy of his Predecessors. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the reason which I haue deliuered concerning those which apply
themselues to the mannaging of Warre: to the ende that vndertaking
dangers rashly, they draw not them into despaire which are vnder their
Charge, nor by desire of an infamous life, they make their deaths disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
and blame worthy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="387" facs="tcp:16537:201"/>
The <hi>Romans</hi> hauing gotten the Victory by force, presently breake
the Pallisadoe of the Enemy, and kill like Sacrifices many <hi>Celts</hi> sleeping
in Drunkennesse vpon their Mattresses,<note place="margin">The <hi>Celts</hi> slaine sleeping.</note> and assemble together the rest
of the Prisoners: By the which there did accrew nine score thousand
Crownes to the Common-weale. There died in this Battaile as well of
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> as <hi>Gaules,</hi> neare ten thousand men,<note place="margin">The number of the dead.</note> and about two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<hi>Romans.</hi> Some Nobles among the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were taken, the
rest were slaine. When this Newes came to <hi>Rome,</hi> they were scarce
beleeued for that they desired wonderfully to see it done, but as there
came many men declaring not onely what had beene done, but euery
thing in particular, then the City entred into an immoderate ioy: all
the Temples were adorned, and fill'd with Sacrifices and Oblations:
Finally, they grew so confident and assured, as at that time they did not
thinke that <hi>Hannibal</hi> (whom they had formerly so much feared) was
in <hi>Italy.</hi>

we coniecture the ruine of your selues and the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and for the

into a Forrest is no more in his power that hath kindled it, but consumes
all that it encounters: Being moreouer gouerned by the Winds, and
by the consumption of the Forrest, and that many times it sweepes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
suddainly the Incendiary himselfe: so the Warre being once infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

my Masters the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> seeing that the Ilanders, and the <hi>Grecians</hi>

you would make choise of Peace, for that the case concernes you: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
your sences, consenting with those who with reuerence admonish
you. If with some good fortune you did mannage a Warre which
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:16537:202"/>
were profitable, commodious, and glorious (it is that vndoubtedly
which they expect most therein) according to your first intention and
designe of euents, they might with reason pardon you as men of great
courage. This Warre is altogether infamous, full of ignominy, and
cursed, is it not necessary to stay and deferre it? Aduice without doubt
should be freely giuen, you will heare (if you be wise) my words
patiently. It is much better for you to be preserued with a commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
reprehention, then in hearing pleasing words, to perish the first
soone after: and then subsequently the rest of <hi>Greece,</hi> set your ignorance
before your eyes. You say you make Warre against <hi>Philip</hi> for <hi>Greece,</hi>
to the end that being preserued they should not obey his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
But in truth you make Warre to its ruine and defeate.<note place="margin">An accord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and the <hi>Etoliens.</hi>

letters were then dishonourable vnto you, but at this day they are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to the eye, and manifest by your workes. Finally, <hi>Philip</hi> carries
the Name, and is made the colour of this Warre: although hee suffers
nothing that is grieuous: But as he hath many Allies in <hi>Morea,</hi> as the
<hi>Beocians, Negrepontins, Phociens, Locrines, Thessalians</hi> and <hi>Epirotes,</hi> you
haue concluded against them vnder conditions, that the bodies and
moueable goods should belong to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the Cities and
Countries to the <hi>Etoliens.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But as you are Lords of this City, you would not endure they should
offend any Free-man, nor set fire of your City, holding such actions
cruell and barbarous: and yet you haue made a League, according to
the which you haue deliuered the rest of <hi>Greece</hi> to <hi>Barbarians</hi> as your
owne by gift, by an outrage and a most ignominious iniustice. These
are the things which in the beginning you vnderstood not: But at this
day you are made manifest vnto the World by the misery of the poore
<hi>Oretins</hi> and <hi>Eginetes,</hi> for that Fortune hath of purpose rais'd your ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
vpon a Theater. The beginning of this Warre and of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which happen are such. But what can wee expect more, if in the

of great miseries to all the <hi>Grecians?</hi> Beleeue me, that after the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
haue ended the Warre in <hi>Italy</hi> (the which will soone happen,
<hi>Hannibal</hi> being shut vp in a Corner of <hi>Brutia</hi>) they will imploy all their

<hi>Philip,</hi> but the truth is to make all <hi>Greece</hi> subiect: the which will
soone be manifest. For whether they are resolued to carry themselues
like honest and honourable persons, hauing the Victory, the thankes
shall be theirs: If otherwise they shall haue the profits of the Defeates,
and the power ouer them that escape. Then you will call vpon the
Gods, when as none of them or any man will offer to assist you. You
should then in the beginning fore-see all things: This was lawfull for
you. But as many future things are out of humane prouidence, now
at the least you should take a better aduice, hauing seene the euent of
this Warre. I intreate you and exhort you not to enuy your owne safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

And when by his Speech (as he conceiued) somewhat moued the
opinions of many, <hi>Philips</hi> Embassadour entred: who leauing the things
which might be spoken in particular, he sayd, that he had two points
in charge: That if the <hi>Etoliens</hi> brake the peace, he was ready to appeale
vnto the Gods, and to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Embassadours there present, that
they were to be held for the Authors of those things which hereafter
should fall vpon <hi>Greece,</hi> and not <hi>Philip.</hi> Glory saith he, doth much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze
the Enemy, but a reasonable preparation of Armes is of greater
seruice for necessity. Then they should doe that which is necessry,
if they transferre the diligence and care which they haue at this day for
their apparrell, to the preparation of their Armes, obseruing in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell
the ancient negligence. For by this meanes they may giue order
for their priuate course of life, and preserue their Common-wealth.
And therefore (saith he) it is not needfull that he which giues him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to Armes, and to the profession of Warre, should looke when he
puts on his Boots, whether they be handsome, and if his strops and
pantables be braue: nor whether his Cloake and Iacket be rich, when
he must put on a Head-peece. Beleeue me, the danger is manifest
which they must expect, which haue an exteriour shew in more recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
then things necessary. Finally, it were fit they should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that this curiosity in habits sauoured of a woman, I meane that is
not much chast: where as the charges in Armes and seuerity, restraine a
good man, desiring to preserue himselfe and his Countrey.</p>
            <p>All the assistants found this Speech so good, in wondring at the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of this remonstrance, that after they were gone out of the Court,
they pointed at those that were richly clad, forcing some to leaue the
place: and finally, they prepared themselues to Armes and to make
Warre accordingly. Behold how one sole Oration pronounced by a
man of esteeme and in season, not onely retires men from great vices,
but also incites them to great Enterprizes. But if he which giues good
aduice, leads a life answerable to his words, it is necessary that his
councell should purchase credit: the which happened in this man. He
was sober and simple in his apparrell and liuing, and in the vsage of his
body. Finally, he was of a pleasing speech without enuy and rancour. He
studied wonderfully to be found veritable in all his life, and therefore
when he vsed any ordinary speech, the Auditors gaue him great credit.
And as his life serued for an example in all things, so the Auditors
had no great neede of any long Discourse. Wherefore he hath often
in few words, by his credit and knowledge in things, ouerthrowne the
long speeches which seemed to haue beene deliuered sufficiently by the
Enemies. When the Councell was ended, euery man retired to his
Countrey: And in commending as well the man as his words, they had
a conceite that they could not doe amisse vnder his gouernment.</p>
            <p>Finally, <hi>Philopemen</hi> went speedily to the Cities to make preparation
for the Warre. Then he trained vp a multitude assembled: and
when he had not imployed eight Moneths in the preparation of these
forces,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phylopemen</hi> makes Warre against <hi>Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides,</hi> Tyrant of <hi>Lacedemon.</hi>
               </note> he leads his Army to <hi>Mantinea</hi> to fight with the Tyrant for
the liberty of all <hi>Morea. Machanides</hi> likewise taking courage, and
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:16537:203"/>
thinking to preuaile ouer the <hi>Acheins</hi> at his pleasure, giues the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi>
to vnderstand the things that were then necessary, as soone
as hee was aduertised of the assembly of the <hi>Tegeans</hi> at <hi>Mantinia:</hi>
Then suddainly the next day at Sun-rising hee takes his way towards
<hi>Mantinia,</hi> marching on the right wing with the Legionaries, and
placing the Mercenaries on the right and left, going a slow pace in
the beginning of his voyage: He addes moreouer Chariots carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a great abundance of instruments of Warre and Cros-bowes.</p>
            <p>At the same time <hi>Philopomen</hi> hauing diuided his Army into three,
he caused the <hi>Sclauonians</hi> and <hi>Corslets</hi> to goe forth by the Gate which
tends to the Temple of <hi>Neptune,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The order of <hi>Philopomens</hi> Battaile.</note> and withall the strangers and strong
men: then by that which lookes to the West, the Legionaries: and the
Horse-men of the City by the next. Moreouer, he seazed (with the
best of his aduenturers) of a little Hill lying right against the City,
the which extends vpon the way of strangers and the Temple of <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</hi>
And ioyning the <hi>Corslets,</hi> he lodgeth them on the South, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
the <hi>Sclauonians</hi> in a place neare vnto them. Then casting the
Legionaries behind them in a round, he lodgeth them in the space
neare the Ditch which drawes to <hi>Neptunes</hi> Temple, by the midst of the
<hi>Mantinians</hi> Plaine, and ioynes vpon the Mountaines neare vnto <hi>Elis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fasiens.</hi>
He orders moreouer vpon the right wing the <hi>Acheian</hi> Hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
of which <hi>Aristonete</hi> of <hi>Dymce</hi> had the leading: and vpon the
hee had all the Strangers, hauing their distinct Ordonance amongst
them.</p>
            <p>When the Enemies Army approacht, he comes to the Legionaries,
admonishing them in few words, but with the efficacy of the present
danger. But most part of his words were not heard: for the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
prest the cause so much for the affection they bare him, and the
impetuosity of the people, that the Army as it were moued with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
diuine fury, perswaded him to worke without feare. Finally,
he endeauoured (if time would haue permitted him) to declare vnto
them diligently,<note place="margin">The order of <hi>Machanides</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> how this present danger concerned some in regard of
infamy and a base seruitude, and others in regard of liberty alwayes
memorable and glorious. Moreouer, <hi>Machanides</hi> instructs first the
Battalion of the Legionaries which they call <hi>Orthie,</hi> that it should fight
with the right wing of the Enemies. Then he marcheth, and after he
had gain'd a meane space, makes the forme of a Snaile, and drawes his
Army in length, putting his right wing in Front to the left of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheins.</hi>
In regard of the Targetteers, he placeth them before the whole
Army with some space.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philopomen</hi> seeing his attempt, who thought by the Targeteers to
giue a Charge to the Legionary Bands which offended the Souldiers,
and caused a great alarum in the Army, so as hee delayed no longer,
making vse in effect of the <hi>Tarrentins</hi> at the beginning of the Combate
neare to <hi>Neptunes</hi> Temple, vpon the Plaine which was commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
for Horse-men. <hi>Machanides</hi> seeing this, is forced to doe the
like, and to cause the <hi>Tarrentins</hi> (which were with him) to march. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
they fought valiantly in the beginning. But when those that were
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:16537:203"/>
lightly armed, preuailed something ouer them that were weaker, it
fell out in a short time that the Combate began of either side betwixt
the forreine Souldiers. And when as they had ioyned together, and
had fought long like braue men, the danger was equall, so as the rest
of the Armies, expecting the issue of the Battaile, could not fight there,
for that many times both the one and the other in fighting, exceeded
their first station. Yet the Tyrants souldiers had for a time the better,
considering their multitude and dexterity, with their Armes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
The which did not happen without cause. For as the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
in Comminalties, is more cheerefull in Combats in Warre, then
the Subiects which are Enemies to Tyrants, so strange Souldiers ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
pay of Monarches, excell those of Common-weales. And as
some Subiects fight for liberty, and some are in danger of seruitude,
some also of the Mercenaries fight for a certaine profit, others for the
defence of their Liues. But a popular power puts not her liberty into
the hands of Mercenaries, after they haue defeated their Enemies:
Whereas a Tyrant the greater Enterprize he makes, the more souldiers
he hath need off. For as he doth more outrages, so he hath more wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
ouer his life.</p>
            <p>The safety then of Monarches consists in the good affection, and
forces of his forreine Souldiers.<note place="margin">The safety of Monarches.</note> Wherefore then it hapned that the
forreine Souldiers fought with such great Courage and Resolution, as
the <hi>Sclauonians</hi> and <hi>Horacites</hi> being in front of them could not indure
their Charge: flying all as repuls'd towards <hi>Mantinia,</hi> seauen Furlongs
distant. Then that which some men held in doubt was made plaine
and certaine. It is manifest that many actions in Warre breed Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of things, so do they ignorance. It is a great matter for him
that hath purchased Authority in the beginning, to extend it farther:
But it is a farre greater matter to fixe vpon him whose first attempts
haue not beene successefull: and to consider the indiscretion of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate,
and to obserue their faults.</p>
            <p>You shall oftentimes see that they which seeme to haue the better,
are within a short space frustrated of all in generall: And againe, they
which at the first were beaten, haue by their industry restored all: the
which appeared then betwixt these two Princes. For when the bands
of Souldiers which the <hi>Acheins</hi> had wauered, and that the left wing
was broken, <hi>Machanides</hi> leauing his good Fortune and the Victory
of those of the Wing, and to assaile the others in Front, and finally
to attend the Victory, he did nothing of all this, but scattred with
the Mercenaries, without order like a young man, he pursued the
Chase, as if feare had not beene able to pursue those which fled vnto
the Gates. The Chiefe of the <hi>Acheins</hi> imployed all his power to
stay the Mercenaries with cries and perswasions, calling to the rest of
their Commaunders. But when he saw them forcibly repuls'd, he was
not amazed if they turned head, or despairing, abandoned the place,
but he with-drew the Wing which charged and pursued them. And
when the place where the danger was, was abandoned, he sent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
to the first Legionaries, that they should couer themselues with
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:16537:204"/>
their Targets; and in keeping order he went speedily before. Being
come suddainly to the place abandoned, hee defeated the pursuers,
hauing great aduantage vpon the Enemies battailion. Hee likewise
perswaded the Legionaries to haue a good Courage and resolution, and
not to budge, vntill hee gaue them order to march close in Battaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Enemy. And as for <hi>Polybius</hi> the <hi>Megalopolitaine,</hi> hauing
gathered together the remainder of the <hi>Sclauonians</hi> which had turned
Head, with the armed men and the Strangers, he enioynes him to
haue a great care to keepe the Battallion in good order, and to looke
to those which were retired from the Chase. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi>
likewise resuming Courage and strength, for that they were esteemed
the most valiant, charged the Enemies with their Iauelings without
Commaund.</p>
            <p>And as in this pursuite they were come vnto the brinke of the
Ditch, and had no more time to returne, for that they were in the
Enemies hands, and that finally they forsooke and disdained the Ditch,
for that it had many descents, and was drie and without Trees, they
ranne into it without any discretion. As this occasion offers it selfe
against the Enemy, <hi>Phylopomen</hi> hauing fore-seene it long before, he
then Commaunded all the Legionaries to aduance with their Iaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.
And when as all the <hi>Acheins</hi> with one resolution had cast
themselues vpon the Enemies with horrible cries, hauing formerly
broken the battalion of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> descending into the
Ditch, they turne Head with great Courage against the Enemy which
held the higher ground. It is true, that a great part was defeated as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
by the <hi>Acheins</hi> as their owne men. That which I haue spoken
happens not by chance, but by the prouidence of the Commaunder,
who had suddainly made this Ditch. <hi>Philopomen</hi> fled not from the
Battaile as some had conceiued: But considering and aduising dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
like a good Commaunder of all things in particular, that if
<hi>Machanides</hi> should lead his Army thither, it would happen that by ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of the Ditch, he would fall into danger with his Battalion,
as it succeeded in Effect. And if considering the difficulty of the
Ditch, hee should seeme to feare and turne Head, hee should then
be wonderfully frustrated of his Enterprize and Designe, for that hee
should haue the Victory without fight, <hi>Machanides</hi> beeing defeated
by a vnfortunate disaster. It had happened to many which had vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
a Battaile, that finding themselues insufficient to ioyne with the
Enemy, some in regard of the disaduantage of places, others for
the multitude, and some for other causes, and by this same meanes
shewing and expressing themselues in their flight to bee of little Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
some hoping to be stronger vpon the Reare, and others that
they might escape the Enemy safely. Among the which were these
Commaunders.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Philopomen</hi> was not deceiued in his fore-sight: by whose en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour
it happened, that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> made a speedy flight.
And when hee saw his Legions to vanquish, hee laboured to bring
that vnto an ende which remained of an absolute Victory. Which
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:16537:204"/>
was, that <hi>Machanides</hi> should not escape, and therefore know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to be at the pursuite of the Chase, on that side of the Ditch
which lay towards the City with his Mercenaries, had not beene reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and with drawne, he attends his comming. But when as <hi>Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi>
flying after the Chase, saw his Army turne head, and hearing that
all hope was lost for him, he laboured with his forreine Souldiers in
turning head, to escape thorough the Enemies dispersed, and scattred in
their Chase. Whereunto they likewise hauing regard, stayed with him
in the beginning, feeding themselues with the same hope of safety.
But when as at their comming they saw the <hi>Acheins</hi> keepe the Bridge
vpon the Ditch, then all amazed they abandon him and fled, euery
man looking to his owne preseruation. And when the Tyrant despai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of the passage of the Bridge, he went directly to the Ditch, and
endeauours to finde a passage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philopomen</hi> knowing the Tyrant by his purple Robe, and the capar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risson
of his Horse, leaues <hi>Polybius</hi> there, and giues him charge to keepe
the passage carefully, not sparing any of the Mercenaries, for that
most commonly they fauour and support the Tyrant of <hi>Lacedemon.</hi> In
regard of himselfe, he takes <hi>Polyene, Cypariss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he then made vse, marching against the Tyrant and his Company on
the other side of the Ditch. <hi>Machanides</hi> had at that time two men with
him, that is to say, <hi>Anaxidamus</hi> and a strange Souldier: When hee
prest his Horse to take a certaine commodious passage of the Ditch, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopomen</hi>

happened to <hi>Anaxidamus</hi> by the Horse-men which marcht with him.
The third man despairing of the passage,<note place="margin">Anaxidamus <hi>slaine.</hi>
               </note> escaped the danger by flight,
whilest they slew the other two. After their death <hi>Simies</hi> Company
stript them, and brought away the Head and Armes of the Tyrant, to
make his death knowne vnto the Troupes: whereby they might with
more diligence pursue the Enemies into their City: the which serued
much to moue the Commons. For by this meanes they reduced the

kept it still entire as vnder a good Leader, and commanded so great a

to the Commandments of one man, according to his desire: although
the Euents were not alwayes answerable, but diuers: and that many
times Fortune smiled vpon him, and was sometimes opposite. These
things considered, you may safely say (in wondring at the vertue of
this Commander, in that which concernes this point) that if hee had
first assailed the other Countries of the World, and then the <hi>Romans,</hi>
he would haue preuailed in all that he had attempted. But seeing at
this day hee hath begun the Warre against those which hee should

               <p>
                  <hi>Asdrubal</hi> hauing drawne together the Souldiers from those places

                  </note> building a Pallisadoe on the side of the

Hee had three score and ten thousand Foote, foure thousand
Horse, and two and thirty Elephants. <hi>Publius Scipio</hi> on the other
side sends <hi>Marcus Iunius</hi> to <hi>Lochis</hi> to receiue the Bands which hee

                     <hi>Publius Scipio</hi> drawes his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my together.</note> being three thousand Foote and fiue hundred Horse.
In regard of the other Allies, he accompanies them, taking his way to
the place appointed.</p>
               <p>When hee was come to <hi>Catalongne,</hi> and to the places which
were about <hi>Becyle,</hi> and had ioyned his Army with <hi>Marcus,</hi> and
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:16537:205"/>
with the Troupes of <hi>Colichante,</hi> he fell into a great perplexity for the
apparent dangers. For in truth he had not a sufficient <hi>Roman</hi> Army
without the forces of the Allies to hazard a Battaile. It seemed an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
thing, foolish, and rash for those which put their hope in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of their Allies to hazard a Battaile. But as he was for a time in
suspence, and that the affaires concluded that he must vse the Allies,
he came to fight with the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> to the end that by this meanes
he might make the Enemy imagine that hee fought with his whole
Army.</p>
               <p>This being resolu'd, he marches with all his Troups, being forty fiue
thousand Foot, and about three thousand Horse. And when he was
neare the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> so as he might well be discouered, he camps
about certaine little Hils right against the Enemy.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Asdrubal</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to haue found a fit time to charge the <hi>Romans</hi> in Camping, he
fell vpon their Campe with the greatest part of his Horse-men, and
<hi>Massanissa</hi> with the <hi>Numades,</hi> hauing a conceite to surprize <hi>Scipio</hi>
suddainly. But he hauing formerly fore-seene the future, he layd an
Ambush of Horse-men behinde a certaine Hill,<note place="margin">A suddaine charge of the <hi>Romans</hi> against the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                  </note> equall in number to
those of the <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> who charging by surprize, many in the
beginning turning head, in regard of this vnexpected Charge of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
fell from their Horses, others affronting the Enemies fought va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly.
But for the dexterity of the <hi>Roman</hi> Horse-men in fighting,
the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> being troubled and discontented, after some little
resistance gaue backe, retiring in the beginning in good order: But
when the <hi>Romans</hi> pursued them, they tooke their flight vnder the
Campe. This done, the <hi>Romans</hi> assure themselues the more to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe
the danger: and the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> did the contrary. The
dayes following they draw their Armies into the Plaine which lay
betwixt them, and making skirmishes as well of Horse-men, as of
their most valiant Foote, and trying one another they resolued to
Battaile.</p>
               <p>It seemed then that <hi>Scipio</hi> had practised a double stratagem. For
when he saw <hi>Asdrubal</hi> slow in ordring of his forces, and to put the
<hi>Lybians</hi> in the midst, and the Elephants vpon the two wings: Then
as hee was accustomed to obserue the opportunity of the time,<note place="margin">The double po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of <hi>Scipio.</hi>
                  </note> and
to make head against the <hi>Lybians</hi> by <hi>Romans,</hi> and to mingle the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
vpon the wings, on the day which hee resolued to fight, hee
doth now the contrary, giuing by this meanes great comfort to his
forces for the Victory, and weakning the Enemy. Presently at the
Sunne-rising he giues all the Souldiers notice by men appointed, that
all they which were to fight armed, should stand before the Pallisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe.
This done, when they had obeyed him cheerefully, for the
hope they had conceiued for the future, he sends the Horse-men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and the ablest Souldiers, giuing them charge to approach the
Enemies Campe, and that in skirmishing couragiously they should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
the Battaile. For his part, he marcheth at Sun-rising with the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
And being come into the midst of the field, he drew his Army in
Battaile after another forme then he had bin accustomed.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Scipio</hi> puts his men in battaile</note> For he put the

                  <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the midst, and the <hi>Romans</hi> vpon the wings. When as
the Horse-men approacht the Pallisadoe, and that the rest of the
Army was in sight and ready, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had scarce time
to arme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Asdrubal</hi> being then forced to drawe the valiantest of his men to field
against the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Asdrubal</hi> puts his men in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile.</note> being yet fasting without preparation and in haste
both the Foot-men and Horse-men: and to plant his Army of Foot-men
not farre from the Mountaines, and the Ordonance in the Plaine
as they had beene accustomed. The <hi>Romans</hi> stayed some time: but for
that the day was well aduanced, and that the Combat of either side
was vncertaine and equall, and that there was danger that they which
should be prest, turning head, would retire vpon their Battalions, then
<hi>Scipio</hi> retiring the Skirmishers by the space betwixt the Ensignes, he
diuides them vpon the wings after those which had beene formerly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.
Then he giues order to assaile the Enemy in Front, first to the
Iauelings, and then with Horse-men: and being a Furlong from the
Enemy, he commands the <hi>Spaniards</hi> which were in Battaile, to march
in the same order, and that they should turne the Ensignes vpon the
right hand, and they of the left doing the contrary. And when he
began on the right side, <hi>Lacius Marcus</hi> and <hi>Marcus Iunius</hi> led three
braue Troups of Horse-men on the left hand, and before were those
which were lightly armed and accustomed to the Warre, with three
Bands of Foot-men (the <hi>Romans</hi> call a Band of Foot-men a Cohort)
to whom the Targetteers ioyned on the one side, and the Archers
on the other.</p>
               <p>In this sort they marched against the Enemy, making by this meanes
an attempt with effect, considering the continuall repaire of those
which ioyned with them by files. As by chance these men were not
farre from the Enemy, and that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> which were on the
wing were farther off, as they which matched a slow pace, they
make an attempt vpon the two Battalions of the Enemy, drawne in
length with the <hi>Roman</hi> forces, according to that which had beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
in the beginning. The following alterations (by the meanes
whereof it happened that they which followed, ioyned with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
encountring the Enemies in a direct line, had betwixt them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
orders) so as the right Battalion had on the left side the Foot-men
mingled with the Horse. For the Horse-men which were on
the right wing, mingling with the Iauelings of the Foot lightly armed,
laboured to inclose the Enemies. The Foot-men on the other side
couered themselues with their Targets. They which on the left
hand were in the Troups charged with their Iauelings, and the Hors-men
accompanied with the Archers with their full speed. By this
motion there was a left wing made of the right wing of the Horse-men,
and of the most valiant Souldiers of the two Battalions: But the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
made no great accompt, being more carefull to vanquish the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy
with the other Battalion: wherein he had good iudgement. We
must know things as they are done, and vse a fit obseruation according
to the occasion offered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="397" facs="tcp:16537:206"/>
By the charge of these men the Elephants assailed by the Archers,<note place="margin">A disorder by the Elephants.</note>
and the Horse-men with Darts and Iauelings, and tormented of all
sides were wounded, making as great a spoile of their Friends as of
their Enemies. For they ran vp and downe and ouer-threw men of
all sides, breaking the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Battalions. In regard of that of
the <hi>Lybians</hi> which held the middle part, and was of great seruice, it
stood idle vnto the end. For not able to succour those which on the
wings abandoned the place, by reason of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> charge: nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in their station, doe that which necessity required: for that
the Enemies which they had in Front, did not giue them Battaile.</p>
               <p>It is true that the wings fought for a time valiantly: Considering
that all was in danger. And as the heare was vehement, the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
brake, seeing that the end of the Combate succeeded not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their desire, and that their chiefest preparation was hindred:
The <hi>Romans</hi> on the other side had the aduantage both in force and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage:
and in that principally, that by the prouidence of the Generall
the best furnished among the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were made vnprofitable.
Wherefore <hi>Asdrubal</hi> being thus prest, retired in the beginning with a
slow pace from the Battaile: Then turning in Troupe, he recouered the
neighbour Mountaines. And when as the <hi>Romans</hi> pursued them neare,
they posted to their Pallisadoe. If some God had not preserued them,
they had suddainly lost their Fort. But for that the disposition of the
Aire changed, and the raine fell continually with violence, the <hi>Romans</hi>
could hardly recouer their Fort.</p>
               <p>And although that <hi>Publius Scipio</hi> had sufficient experience of the
Warre,<note place="margin">A defect in the Text.</note> yet he neuer fell into so great a doubt and perplexity, the
which happened not without reason. For as wee may fore-see and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
exteriour causes and discommodities of the Body,<note place="margin">A good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison.</note> as cold, heate,
labour, and wounds, before they happen: and cure them when they
come: being on the other side difficult to fore-see those which proceed
from the Body, and are hardly cureable when they happen: we must
iudge the same of policies and Armies. It is true, there is a speedy
meanes and helpe to preuent the Warres and Ambushes of Strangers
when they are contriued: But against those which the Enemy doth
practise in the State, as seditions and mutinies, the Phisicke is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
and requires a great dexterity and singular industry in the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of affaires. But in my opinion one aduice is necessary for all Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
Cities, and bodies politique: which is, that in that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
the things aboue mentioned, they neuer suffer too much sloth
and idlenesse: especially in time of prosperity, and the abundance of
all things necessary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scipio</hi> as a man of excellent diligence,<note place="margin">The wisedome of <hi>Scipio.</hi>
                  </note> and consequently industrious
and actiue to mannage great affaires, propounded a certaine course to
decide the present combustions, after he had assembled the Captaines
of thousands. He gaue order that they should promise vnto the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
the restitution of the victuals and taxes: and to giue credit to his
promise, they should leuie the ordinary taxes ordained in Cities
diligently and openly for the reliefe of the whole Army, to the end
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:16537:207"/>
it might be apparent that this preparation was made for the institution
of their Victuals. And that moreouer, the Milleniers should command
the Commissaries of the Victuals, and admonish them to haue a care,
and to take charge of the Victuals: and that conferring among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
they should make knowne, if part of them or altogether would
vndertake it. He sayd, that they must consider of that which was to
be done. The others thinking of the same things, had a care of the
Treasure. And when as the Milleniers had made knowne the things
which had beene ordayned, <hi>Scipio</hi> being aduertised, imparted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Councell that which was to be done. They concluded that
they should resolue on the day when they were to appeare: So as
the people should be sent backe, and the Authors seuerely punished:
who were to the number of fiue and thirty.</p>
               <p>And when the Day was come, and the Rebels there present, as
well to obtaine pardon, as for their Victuals, <hi>Scipio</hi> secretly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
the Captaines Milleniers, that they should goe and meete with
the Rebels, and in choosing fiue of the chiefe of the Mutiny (euery
man carrying himselfe courteously at their encounter) they should
bring them to his Pauillion: if this could not be done, yet at the least
they should conuay them to the Banquet, and to this kind of assembly.
And as for the Army which was with him, he gaue them notice three
dayes before, to make prouision of Victuals for a long time: as if <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
should goe to <hi>Andobale</hi> to fight: whereof the Rebels being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertized,
they were the more assured. They expected to enioy a great
power, if (the rest of the Army being separated) they were admitted
about a Commander, when they approacht neare the City, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
the other Souldiers, that being prepared the day following, they
should come forth at the breake of day. In regard of the Milleniers
and Captaines, he giues them charge that after their comming forth
of the City, they should stay the Souldiers in Armes at the Gate, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
first lodg'd the Baggage: and that afterwards they should diuide
themselues by the Gates, and haue a care that none of the Rebels
should escape. They which were appointed to receiue them, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to those which came vnto them, entertained the offendors cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously
according vnto that which had beene enioyned them. Their
charge was to seaze vpon these men, at such time as they should be
set at the Banquet, and to keepe them bound: So as not any of the
Company being within should goe forth, but onely he that should
aduertize the Commander what had beene done, Wherefore when
the Milleniers had performed their Charge, the Generall seeing in the
Morning following those to be assembled in the place which were arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
he causeth an Assembly to be called.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Publius Scipio</hi> assembles his Army.</note> When the aduertisement was
giuen, they all came running as of custome, whether it were with a
desire to see the Commander, or to heare those things which were
to be spoken of the present affaires. <hi>Scipio</hi> sends to the Milleniers which
were at the Gates, and commands them to bring the Souldiers that
were armed, and to enuiron the whole assembly: Then marching
forth, he amazeth them all at the first sight. A great number in truth
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:16537:207"/>
thought that he was not well disposed: But when contrary vnto their
opinions they found him sound and safe, they were amazed at his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
Finally, hee vsed this Speech vnto them, saying, that hee
wondred for what cause some of them were offended, or vnder what
colour they were mooued to attempt a Rebellion.</p>
               <p>There are three causes for the which men presume to fall into a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny
against their Princes and Country: VVhich are,<note place="margin">Three causes of the peoples mutiny against Princes.</note> when as they
blame their Gouernour, and indure them vnwillingly; or when they
are offended with the present Gouernment; or vpon a conception in
their opinions of a greater and better hope. I demaund of you, sayth
he, which of these three hath mooued you. Are you angry with me
that I haue not deliuered you Victualls? It is not my fault. For you
haue not wanted any Victuals vnder my Leading. It is the errour of
the <hi>Romans</hi> which haue not yeilded that vnto you now, which hath
beene formerly due vnto you? Should you then accuse your Country,
so as you should Rebell and become its Enemy, then being present to
speake vnto me, and to intreate your friends to assist you? The which
in my opinion had beene much better. It is true, a pardon may bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vnto Mercenaries, if they abandon those from whom they receiue
pay: But it is not fit to pardon such as carry Armes for themselues,
their Wiues, and their Children. For it is euen like as a man should
come vnto his Father, and charge him that he had villanously cozened
him in matters of money, and kill him from whom hee holds his life.
Haue I opprest you more with toiles and dangers then the rest, giuing
them more Commodities and profites then vnto you? In trueth you
dare not speake it, neither can you conuince me although you durst at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
it.</p>
               <p>I cannot coniecture the cause for the which being incensed against
me, you haue attempted this Rebellion. I would vnderstand the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
from your selues. I thinke there is not any man among you
that can alledge or pretend any thing. You cannot, in trueth, be sad
for the present. When was there euer greater abundance of all things,
nor more prerogatiues of the Citty of <hi>Rome?</hi> When was there euer
greater hope for Souldiers then there is at this day? Peraduenture
some one of these desperate men will thinke that at this day the profits
are greater in shew, and the Hope better and more firme with the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
Which are they? Is it <hi>Andobale</hi> and <hi>Mandonin?</hi> Which of you
doth not know that as they first falsified their Faith with the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
comming to vs? And that now againe they declared themselues
our Enemies, inviolating their oath and Faith? Were it not an honest
and commendable thing, that in giuing them your Faith, you should
become Enemies to your owne Country? And yet you haue no hope
in them to enioy <hi>Spaine.</hi> You were not sufficient being ioyned to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobale</hi>

                  </gap>?</p>
               <p>I would know it from your selues, if you haue put your confidence
in the Experience and Vertue of the Captaines which now are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
you, or in the Rods and Maces which march before them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

of there is no honesty to vse any longer Discourse. But in truth there
is nothing of all this; neither can you inuent any thing against me nor

               <p>And when he had vsed this Speech, the Souldiers that were in
Armes and round about, made a great noise with their Swords in the
Proches, and presently the Authors of the mutiny were brought in
naked and bound. Finally, the multitude grew into a great amazement
for the horror of the Executions which were done in their sight:<note place="margin">A punishment of the Mutines.</note> so
as when as some were whipt, and others executed, they moued not an
eye, nor any man spake a word, remaining all amazed and terrified by
these accidents. The Authors of these mischiefes being whipt and
slaine, and drawne through the midst of them: the rest were assured
in common by the Commander and Princes, that no man hereafter
should be punished by any man for the remembrance of this fact.
Wherefore they came all to the Milleniers, and sweare absolutely to
obey the Commandments of the Princes, and not to consent to any

settles his Army in its former estate. Then suddainly drawing it toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
within <hi>Carthage,</hi> he made his complaints of the rashnesse and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse
of <hi>Andobale</hi> towards them: and after he had made a long
speech of his disloyalty, he incensed the hearts of many against the sayd
Potentate. Finally, he put them in minde of their encounters against
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> whilest they were vnder the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi>
Commanders: Of whom (as they had beene alwayes victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious)
there was no cause he sayd, to be in doubt or feare, but that
comming againe to fight with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> vnder <hi>Andobale,</hi> they would
be defeated. Wherefore he sayd he would make no more vse of the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> to fight, and that hee would vndergoe the danger with the
<hi>Romans</hi> alone: to the end it may be manifest to all the world, that wee
haue not chased the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> out of <hi>Spaine</hi> with the helpe of <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards:</hi>
but by a <hi>Roman</hi> vertue, and that by our owne dexterity wee
haue vanquished them with the <hi>Celtiberians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Speech being ended, hee perswaded them to liue in Concord,
and that they would vndertake this present danger, if euer they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:16537:208"/>
any with great assurance. In regard of the meanes of the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
he assures them that with the helpe of the Gods he will take order.
The Commons conceiued so great a courage and confidence, as all
of them carryed a countenance like vnto those which behold their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
and prepare to fight. His words being ended, hee sent backe
the assembly. The next day hee raiseth his Campe and marcheth:
and being come on the tenth day to a Riuer, he passeth it foure dayes
after:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Scipio</hi> layes a baite for the Enemy.</note> then he plants himselfe before the Enemies, hauing recouered
a certaine Plaine betwixt his Campe and theirs. The day following he
sent forth towards the Enemy vpon the Plaine, some Cattell which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the Army: and commands <hi>Caius</hi> to keepe certaine Horse-men
in a readinesse, and to the Chiefe of the Milleniers, to prepare Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
and Slingers.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had fallen suddainly vpon the Cattell, he sent
certaine Souldiers that were Archers. The Combat beginning, and
the Souldiers running vnto it on either side in good numbers, there
grew a great Skirmish of Foot-men neare vnto the Plaine. When a
fit occasion was offred to assaile the Enemy, and that <hi>Caius</hi> had his
Horse-men ready as he had commanded him, he chargeth the Foot-men,
and repulseth them from the Plaine, to the places neare vnto the
Mountaines, to the end they might be scattred, and slaine in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
When this happened, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> were moued, fearing that
being vanquished in skirmish before they came to the Battaile,<note place="margin">The <hi>Spaniards</hi> put themselues in Battaile.</note> they
should seeme to haue fainted, wherefore at the Sun-rising they drew
their Army in good order to Field, preparing for the Battaile. <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Scipio</hi> was ready to giue it: But when hee saw the <hi>Spaniards</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
without reason into the Plaine, and not onely to put their Hors-men
in order, but also their Foot, he stayed, to the end that a greater
number might assemble in this order of Battaile, hauing confidence in
his Cauallery, and much more in his Foot-men, for that they should
come to an equall Combat, and fight hand to hand: and that the
Armes and men which he had, were more excellent then the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
But for that it seemes necessity prest him, he directed his Army against
those which were in Battaile against the Mountaine:<note place="margin">The order of <hi>Scipio's</hi> Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> drawing foure
Cohorts out of the Campe towards those that were descended into
the Plaine.</p>
               <p>Finally, <hi>Caius Lelyus</hi> led his Horse-men against the Enemy, by the
Hils which come from the Campe vnto the Plaine, and chargeth the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> Horse in the Reare, and in fighting stayes them, to the end
they should not succour their Foot. The Enemies Foot being destitute
of the helpe of their Cauallery, in whom hauing put their trust, they
had descended into the Plaine, were forced and annoyed in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate;
the which likewise happened to the Horse-men. For when as
(inclosed in the streight) they could not fight at ease, their defeate
was greater then that of the Enemy: for that their Foot-men were on
the side, and their Enemies in Front, and their Horse-men were char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the Reare. The Combat being after this manner, they which
descended were in a manner all defeated: They which were ioyning
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:16537:209"/>
vnto the Mountaine fled. They were the most valiant and the third
part of the Army: with whom <hi>Andobale</hi> escaped, recouering a certaine
Fort. <hi>Scipio</hi> hauing ended the Warres of <hi>Spaine,</hi> drew to <hi>Tarracona,</hi>
to carry a great triumph of ioy,<note place="margin">A defeate of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
                  </note> and a glorious Victory to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
Desiring them to be present at the Creation of Consuls, hee
sayles to <hi>Rome</hi> being accompanied by <hi>Caius,</hi> deliuering the Army

this Region. In regard of <hi>Tymeus,</hi> thou maist
with reason terme him ignorant, not onely of
things concerning <hi>Lybia:</hi> but also a Child and
without vnderstanding, and also subiect to a
foolish ancient report, according to the which
we haue heard that <hi>Lybia</hi> is all sandy, dry, and
desarts. The like they sayd of Creatures: And
yet it hath so great abundance of Horses,
Sheepe, and Goats, as I know not where we may finde the like in the
World: For that many people of <hi>Lybia</hi> make no vse of the fruits which
proceede from the hands of man, but liue with Mares Milke.<note place="margin">The manner of the <hi>Lybians</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</note> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
who doth not know the multitude and force of Elephants, Lyons,

and the greatnesse of Ostridges? whereof there are none in <hi>Europe,</hi> and
yet <hi>Lybia is</hi> full of such things: whereof <hi>Tymeus</hi> being wholly ignorant,
he deliuers as it were of purpose things contrary to truth.</p>
            <p>As he hath lyed in matters concerning <hi>Lybia,</hi> so hath he done the
like of the Island of <hi>Cyrnon.</hi> Whereof making mention in his Second
Booke,<note place="margin">The Iland of <hi>Cyruon</hi> not well knowne by <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meus.</hi>
               </note> he saith, that it abounds in Goats, Sheepe, and wilde Oxen,
and moreouer in Stage, Hares, and Wolues, with some other
Beasts: and that the men are much giuen to Venery, and spend their
whole liues therein. When as in the said Iland there is neither wilde
Goate, Oxe, Hare, Wolfe, nor Stagge, nor any such kinde of Beast: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
Foxes, Conies, and wilde Geese. It is true, that a Coney seene
a farre off, seemes like vnto a Leueret: But when they hold it, it differs
much, as well in sight as in taste. It breeds and liues most commonly
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:16537:210"/>
in the ground. For this cause all the Beasts of this Iland seeme wilde,
for that the Keepers cannot follow them, in regard this Iland is woody,
hilly, and steepe: But when they will draw them together, staying in
commodious places, they call them by a Trumpet, and euery one
runs to his owne. Finally, if sometimes they which come into the
Iland, see Goats or Oxen feeding alone, and seeke to take them, they
will not come at them, but flye from them as strangers: and when the
Keepers discouering those which come from the ships, sounds his
Trumpe, they make haste and runne vnto him: which put ignorant men
in conceite, that the Beasts of this Iland are wilde, whereof <hi>Tymeus</hi>
hath made dreames, writing impertinently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>It is no great wonder, that they obey the sound of the Trumpe. For
they which breed Swine in <hi>Italy,</hi> haue no Hogheards which follow
them after the manner of <hi>Greece:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The manner of breeding Swine in <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </note> but going before them a little space,
they sound their Trumpes, and the Swine follow them behinde, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
after the sound. These Beasts are so accustomed euery one to his
Trumpe, as it is a wonder and in a manner incredible to those that shall
heare speake of it. For it happens that for the abundance of Swine,
and other things necessary, the troupes are in such great numbers in
<hi>It<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly:</hi> especially in the ancient and among the <hi>Tyrrbeins</hi> and <hi>Gaules:</hi>
so as of one breeding there are sometimes aboue a thousand. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they send them generally according to the age by troupes in the
Night: So as many being sent together, they cannot keepe them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their kinde, and they mingle as well going and passing, as in
their returne.</p>
            <p>For this cause they haue inuented the sound of the Trumpe, to the
end that when the Swine mingle, they may separate them without
difficulty. When as the Hogheards march one way, and the other
another, in sounding the Trumpe, the Swine part of themselues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
euery one following his owne Trumpe with such great heate, as it
is impossible to stay them, or to hinder their course. But when in
<hi>Greece</hi> they mingle, hunting and running after Fruites, hee that hath
the greatest number and retires soonest, carries with his owne the next,
and sometimes steales <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hem, he that hath the charge not knowing how
he hath lost them: for that the Swine stray far from their Hogheards
whilest they run greedily after the Fruits of Trees, when as they begin
newly to fall. But we haue spoken sufficiently.</p>
            <p>It hath often been my chance to goe to the City of the <hi>Locrines,</hi> and
to deliuer them that which was necessary.<note place="margin">The City of the <hi>Locrines.</hi>

honour and courtesie, in acknowledging to be freed from this trouble,
danger, and charge. Wherefore I am more bound to praise the
<hi>Locrines,</hi> then to doe the contrary. Finally, I haue not omitted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
and write the History of the Collony, which hath giuen vs to
vnderstand, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> is more veritable then that which <hi>Tymeus</hi>
reports.<note place="margin">The Collony of the <hi>Locrines</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
               </note> I am of their opinion which maintaine the renowne of
this Collony to be ancient according to the saying of <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
               <pb n="406" facs="tcp:16537:211"/>
and not of <hi>Tymeus:</hi> for the which they produce these arguments: First
that all things which haue beene famous among them for their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
are come from women and not from men: so as (by way of
example) they are held amongst them for noble, which haue taken
their name from a hundred Families. These are the Families which
the <hi>Locrines</hi> made choise of, before they went to make a Collony:
whereby it might happen, that by Oracles they cast Lots vpon the
Virgins to send them to <hi>Troy:</hi> Whereof some went in Collony, and
their posterity was to bee held Noble, and termed of the hundred
Families.</p>
            <p>Againe, for that which concernes him whom they call <hi>Philephore,</hi>
they haue made this report: That when as they chased the <hi>Sicilians,</hi>
who then inhabited that part of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Nobles and Chiefe men then
honoured the Sacrifices, and tooke many of the customes of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey:
so as they hold nothing of their Paternall, in obseruing that from
them: and in correcting they haue ordained that they should not make
any of their Sonnes <hi>Philephore,</hi> but onely a Virgine, in regard of the
Nobility which came from Women. There was not, neither is it said,
that their hath beene any pactions or accords made betwixt the <hi>Locrines</hi>
and the <hi>Grecians.</hi> In regard of the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> they had all that we haue
made mention of. They say, that when they came first into <hi>Sicily,</hi> they
which then held that Region where they now dwell, being amazed
and receiuing them with feare, made an accord with them: which was,
that they should maintaine Friendship, and enioy the Countrey in
common as long as they should tread vpon the Earth, and carry a head
vpon their shoulders. And when this kinde of Oath was made, they
say, that the <hi>Locrines</hi> did put earth into their shooes, and secretly hid
the heads of Garlicke: and hauing thus sworne, and finally cast the
Earth out of their shooes, and likewise the heads of Garlicke, soone
after they chast away the <hi>Sicilians</hi> out of the Countrey. This the
<hi>Locrines</hi> did say.</p>
            <p>As a Rule although it hath lesse length and breadth,<note place="margin">A defect in the Text.</note> yet it retaines
still the Name, if it hath that which is proper to a Rule: So they say, if
it be not straight and hauing the property of a Rule, it must rather be
called by some other name then a Rule: In like manner they hold that
if the Commentaries of Historiographers which failing either in
Diction or vse, or in any other of the parts which are proper vnto
them, obserue the truth, they deserue the name of a History: But
if that failes, they are no more worthy of that name. For my part, I
confesse, that such Commentaries are to be held for true: and I am of
this opinion in euery part of our Worke, when I say, that euen as when
the Bones are separated from a liuing Creature, it is made vn-vsefull,
so is a History: For if thou takest away the truth, the rest will bee but a
vaine Narration. We haue sayd, that there were two kinds of lies, the
one through ignorance,<note place="margin">Two kinds of vntruth.</note> the other which is deliuered wittingly. The
pardon is easie for those which through ignorance stray from the truth,
and they are to be hated deadly which lie willingly. As men of iudgment
resoluing to reuenge their enemies, doe not first obserue what their
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:16537:211"/>
Neighbour deserues, but rather what they must doe: the like we must
thinke concerning dotracters, not caring for that which the Enemies
ought to heare, but to obserue carefully what it is fit to speake. They
which measure all things according to their choller and enuy, must of
necessity faile in all, and stray from reason, when they speake other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then is fitting. Wherefore we doe not seeme vniustly to reproue
the speeches which <hi>Tymeus</hi> hath held against <hi>Demochares.</hi> In truth,
hee neither deserues pardon nor credit with any man,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tymeus</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible.</note> for that in
wronging him openly, hee straies from reason, in regard of his naturall
bitternesse. Neither doe the iniuries against <hi>Agathocles</hi> please mee,
although he were the most cruell man liuing. I speake of those where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
hee makes mention in the end of his History,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Agathocles</hi> cruell.</note> saying, that <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thocles</hi>
had beene a publique <hi>Sodomite</hi> in his younger yeares, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
to all infamous and vild persons: and so to other foule villanies
which he addes.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, hee sayth, that after his death his Wife lamented him in
this manner: <hi>Why haue not I thee, nor thou mee?</hi> In regard of the spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
which he hath held of <hi>Demochares,</hi> some will not onely cry out,
but wonder with reason at his excessiue Rage. That <hi>Agathocles</hi> had
necessarily by Nature a great prerogatiue, it is manifest by the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
which <hi>Tymeus</hi> hath held. Hee came to <hi>Sarragosse,</hi> flying the
Wheele, Smoake, and Clay, being eighteene yeares old: And when he
was come for this cause, sometime after he was Lord of all <hi>Sicily:</hi> Hee
also drew the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> into great extremities, and ended his life
with the Name of a King, after that he had growne old in this gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
It is not then necessary to say, that there had some things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to <hi>Agathocles</hi> which were great and excellent, and that hee had
had great power, and great forces to execute all these things: And that
a Historiographer must not onely deliuer vnto posterity those things
which concerne the blame, and shew the accusation, but also those
which touch the praise of the man. This is the property of a History.
But this Childe blinded with his owne rancor, in his relation augments
through hatred his offences, omitting wholy the vertues: being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
that it is no lesse blame worthy then a lye in those which write the
Histories of Actions.</p>
            <p>It happened saith he,<note place="margin">A parcell cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</note> that as two young men contended for a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,
that he was somewhat long with a Friend: And when as the other
two dayes before came out of the Countrey, in the absence of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
the Seruant retired speedily into the house: and that afterwards the
other knowing he came thither, seazing on him, brought him into Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
saying, that the Maister of the house ought to giue Caution. For
the Law of <hi>Zaleucus</hi> was,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Zaleucus</hi> the Law-giuer.</note> that he deserued a suite to whom he had made
the retreate. And when as the other sayd, that according to the same
Law he had also made the retreate, for that the Body was parted to
come vnto the Potentate: he saith, that the Princes were in doubt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this businesse, and called <hi>Cosmopole,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cosmopole.</note> referring themselues to him in this
cause. Who interpreted this Law, saying that the retreat hath alwayes
beene to him who had the last, or for a time possessed the thing debated

the maister, this is no true possession. And when as the Young
man discontented at this sentence, sayd, that it was not the sense of the
Law, <hi>Cosmopole</hi> protested, and offerd the Condition, if there were
any man that would speake any thing touching the sentence or sense of
the Law established by <hi>Laleuens.</hi> The which is such, that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines

consulted vpon the sense of the Law: if any one drew the sentence of
the Law to a bad sense, hee was strangled in the presence of the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leniers.
This Speech being propounded by <hi>Cosmopole,</hi> the Young
man answered, that the Condition was vniust: for that <hi>Cosmopole</hi>
had not aboue two or three yeares to liue, (for hee was about foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score

               </note> which
hath beene very famous, and decided in a very short time: In the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
whereof <hi>Galisthenes</hi> hath ert'd in that which doth most import:
I speake of that which <hi>Alexander</hi> made into <hi>Cilicia</hi> against <hi>Darius.</hi> In
the which he saith that <hi>Alexander</hi> had past the streights, which they
call the Ports of <hi>Cilicia;</hi> and that <hi>Darius</hi> tooke his way by the Ports
which they call <hi>Menides,</hi> and drew with his Army towards <hi>Cili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia.</hi>
And when he vnderstood by the Inhabitants, that <hi>Alexander</hi>
tooke his course towards <hi>Syria,</hi> hee followed him: and when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
vnto the streights, hee Camped neare vnto the Riuer of
<hi>Pyre.</hi> Finally, that the compasse of that place was not aboue foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
Furlongs from thence, and from the Sea vnto the hilly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes,
and that the sayd Riuer falls into the Sea, trauersing the
said places: First by the sides of the Mountaine ending at the Plaine, and
then by the Field hauing his Banks rough and not easie to come vnto.</p>
            <p>These things supposed, he sayd, that when as <hi>Alexander</hi> turning
head, came neare vnto <hi>Darius,</hi> his aduice and that of his Princes was
to order his Battaile within his Campe as hee had formerly done,
and to helpe himselfe with this Riuer as with a Rampire, for that
it ran neare vnto his Campe. Finally, he ordred his Horse-men vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Sea-shoare, and vpon their Reare the Mercenaries: so as neare
vnto the Riuer they were ioyned in one, and the Targetteers were
placed in the Mountaines. It is a difficult thing to consider how hee
ordred these before the Battalion:<note place="margin">The reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Calisthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi>
               </note> seeing that the Riuer past neare
vnto the Campe, the multitude likewise being so great. They
were as <hi>Calisthenes</hi> sayth, thirty thousand Horse and as many
Mercenaries.</p>
            <p>It is an easie thing to know what space will containe these. For
they order their Rankes according to the true vse of eight in a great
Troupe of Horse, euery one requiring a space in Front, to the end they
may turne easily. To eight hundred of which a Furlong sufficeth, and
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:16537:212"/>
ten to eight Thousand, and foure to three Thousand fiue hundred: So
as this space of foureteene furlongs, is fill'd with twelue Thousand
Horse. If then he hath ordred all this Troupe of Horse in Battaile, it
wants not much but being tripled, the order hath beene made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any space betwixt. In what place then hath he ordered the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Souldiers, but in the Reare of the Horse-men? But hee will
say no, and that they fought with the <hi>Macedonians</hi> at their first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.
Of necessitie there must be an vniting made, seeing that the
order of the Horse-men held the moiety of the place towards the Sea,
the other towards the Mountaines being kept by the Mercenaries.
Hereby we may inferre, how close the Horse men were vnited, and
what space there must be from the Riuer vnto the Campe. Then hee
sayth, that when the Enemies approached, <hi>Darius</hi> being in the midst
of his Armie, called vnto him the Mercenaries and their Wing. But
we may doubt how this is spoken. For it is necessarie that the Horse-men
and Mercenaries should be ioyned about the middest of this same
place. When as <hi>Darius</hi> was in the middest of his Mercenaries, how
hath he call'd them? Finally hee sayth, that the Horse-men of the
right Wing fought with <hi>Alexander</hi> at his first comming: and that hee
receiued them valliantly, and fought with them in front, and that
the Combate of eyther side was very furious.</p>
            <p>In regard of that which was spoken by him that the Riuer was in
the middest (as a little before we haue deliuered) hee hath forgotten
himselfe. Finally, he writes things of <hi>Alexander</hi> like vnto these. He
saith that hee past into <hi>Asia,</hi> accompanied with fortie Thousand foot,
and foure Thousand fiue hundred Horse. And as he would haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced,
there came vnto him out of <hi>Macedony</hi> other fiue Thousand
foote, and eight hundred Horse: And although that for the affaires
of his long absence, he had left three thousand foote, and three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Horse, yet he had fortie two thousand remaining. These things
presupposed, hee sayth that <hi>Alexander</hi> was aduertised of <hi>Darius</hi> des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
into <hi>Sicilia,</hi> so hee was not aboue a hundred furlongs from him,
and that he had alreadie past the streights of the Countrie, and for
this cause turning head he repast them againe, putting the great Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
in Front, then the Horse-men, and after all the rest of the bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
of the Army.</p>
            <p>And when he came afterwards into the plaine, that all the baggage
being packt vp, hee commaunded that being mingled with the Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
they should make their rankes, containing first about two and
thirtie in number, then of sixteene, and of eight neere the Enemy.
These Speeches haue lesse reason then the former. For as the furlong
containes in these spaces sixteene hundred men, when a rancke is of
eighteene men, so as they be euery one separated a Fathome, it is
manifest and doth plainly appeare that the ten will containe sixteene
Thousand men, and twentie double the number. The which may
easily appeare, for that when as <hi>Alexander</hi> ordred his Army by sixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
men in a rancke, it was very necessary that the place should bee
of twenty Furlongs, and yet all the Cauallerie remained and
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:16537:213"/>
ten thousand Foote. Finally, hee saith, that hee led his whole Army
in Front against the Enemies, being yet forty Furlongs off. But that is
so strange, as wee can hardly imagine any thing more insensible. Where
shall wee finde such spaces in the Champion Countrey euen in <hi>Cilicia,</hi>
that a Battaile set in order, holding twenty Furlongs in breadth, and
forty in length, may march in the Front? There are so many hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
to order this forme of Battaile, as they can hardly be numbred.
Moreouer, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he sayings of <hi>Calisthenes</hi> giue no sufficient arguments to
purchase credite. For hee sayth, that the Torrents which fall from
the Mountaines, make so many and such great Moores and Fenns, as
he assures vs that a great number of <hi>Persians</hi> perished there in the flight.
But would <hi>Darius</hi> suddainly shew himselfe against the Enemy? Is
there nothing more easie then a Battalion broken and scattred in Front?
But how much more easie is it to order a Battaile in a conuenient pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
then to leade an Army directly to fight, being broken and scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
in woody and crooked places? And therefore it were better to
leade in Army close and vnited, and double rather then Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druple.</p>
            <p>By this meanes it would not be impossible to finde the meanes to
passe, and to put the Battaile in order, and with ease, if hee might by
his Scouts discouer the comming of the Enemy. But <hi>Calisthenes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the rest, orders not the Horse men in Battaile, when he led the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in Field, being in Front, ordring the Foote-men equally. It is
also a strange thing when hee saith, that <hi>Alexander</hi> being neare the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
comprehended the order of his Battalion of eight for a Ranke:
So it is manifest that necessarily the length of this Battalion contained
the space of about forty Furlongs. But if they haue beene (as the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
said) close together, so as they haue beene ioyned one to another:
Yet it would be necessary, that the place should containe Twenty Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs.
And yet he saith, there were but foureteene: and that in such
sort, as one part was towards the Sea, and a moiety of the Army vpon
the right hand: and that moreouer all the armed men had place suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
on the side of the Mountaines, to the end they might not bee
supprest by the Enemy holding the borders of the Hills.</p>
            <p>Wee know well that he makes a crooked order within: But we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
leaue out ten thousand Foote, which exceeds the meanes which he
hath giuen: So as the length of this Battalion according to <hi>Calisthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
hath want of aboue twelue Furlongs, in the which it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that thirty two thousand men, contayning a restraint of thirty in a
Ranke being ioyned, haue beene there comprehended. Hee sayth,
that this Battalion was ordred after the Rate of eight in a Ranke. These
errours doubtlesse cannot be defended, for that which is impossible in
it selfe, is not worthy of credit. As often as wee haue respect vnto
the spaces due vnto euery man, and to the length of all the place, and
to the number of men, the lye were no excusable. It were losse of time
to repeate all his fooleries.</p>
            <p>He saith, that <hi>Alexander</hi> thirsted after a Battaile against <hi>Darius,</hi>
and that <hi>Darius</hi> was of the same opinion in the beginning, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:16537:213"/>
chang'd his resolution. Hee doth not shew how they knew one
another, nor what order they obserued in their Army, nor whether
<hi>Darius,</hi> past: Neither finally, how the Battalions came to the Riuer
side, seeing it was crooked and hight. Without doubt wee cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that <hi>Alexander</hi> committed so grosse an errour: seeing that
from his Infancy hee had gotten so great experience and practise in
the Art of Warre.<note place="margin">An excuse of <hi>Alexander</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Calisthenes.</hi>
               </note> Wee must rather thinke that the Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
could not through ignorance discerne things possible from the
impossible in these affaires. But wee haue spoken sufficient at this time
of <hi>Ephorus</hi> and <hi>Calisthenes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First hee is of Opinion, that they must aduertise those of the
Councell, that the Trumpets awakes sleepers during the Warre,
and Birds in the time of Peace. Finally, hee sayth, that <hi>Hercules</hi>
instituted the Olympicke Combats, and the truce and abstinence from
Warre: and that by this meanes hee hath shewed a signe of his will.
In regard of those against whom hee made Warre, hee annoyed them
all through necessity, and for Command: but hee was neuer willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Authour of any harme to man. Hee consequently brings in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>

those which were Noble or Rich, or had any honour from their

to Mercenaries. Who were Murtherers, Theeues, Robbers, and
breakers of houses. Finally, this kind of men (to whom the Country
was forbidden, in regard of their wickednesse and villanies) were by
him carefully drawne together from all the parts of the Earth, of whom
he held himselfe Prince and King. He had Lanciers for the guarde of
his Body, by whom it plainely appeared that his wickednesse and
power would be of long continuance. Besides the said things hee was
not satisfied with the banishmens of Citizens, but moreouer he left not
any place safe for Fugitiues, not any certaine refuge. He slue some vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the way, sending after them, and kill'd others in their returne. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in Cities (where the Fugitiues did remaine) he hired houses neare
vnto them by men not suspected, sending <hi>Candiots</hi> thither: who making
holes in the Wall, slew them with Arrowes, or at the Windowes, the

the multitude of Souldiers which hee entertained for their safety,
and finally the charges hee was at for the Gods, and the publique good
of the Citty. If by this Speech he perswaded them, then he had them
ready at his deuotion; but if any one refusing would not giue care vnto

rise out of his Chaire, hee imbraced it as his Wife, and approacht it
neare vnto his bosome. This Image had the Elbowes and Hands full of
Nailes vnder the garment, and likewise neare the Papps, and when he
toucht the backe of the Image with his hand, he extended it vnto the

against the <hi>Numidians,</hi> as for their preuarication both against
God and Men. Whilest hee ruminated of many things with a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
hope for the future, for that hee feared a danger by Strangers,
knowing that the Enemy encreased much, hee resolued in the end
vpon this occasion. Some of those which hee had sent to <hi>Syphax,</hi>
related vnto him, that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> besides their Winter-tents,
had their Lodgings made of Wood and Leaues, and among the
<hi>Numidians,</hi> the Princes had them of Reeds, and they of the Cities
there assembled of Leaues: Some being of the Ditch and Pallisadoe,
and others without.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="418" facs="tcp:16537:216"/>
               <hi>Scipio</hi> hauing a conceire, that if hee assailed their Campe by fire,
it would bee a surprize vnexpected by the Enemy, and of great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
for him, inclined vnto it. In regard of <hi>Syphax,</hi> hee intended
by his Embassies which hee sent vnto <hi>Scipio,</hi> to settle a Peace, so as
the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> should leaue <hi>Italy,</hi> and the <hi>Romans Affricke:</hi>
and that either of them should enioy that which they held: which
things being formerly heard, hee had not accepted: but at that time
hee aduertised the <hi>Numidian</hi> by an Embassie in few words, that the
proposition made by him was not impossible. So as <hi>Syphax</hi> hauing
great hope, solicited a parley often. This done, there were many and
frequent Embassies.</p>
            <p>It happened that sometimes they met without Guards, and <hi>Scipio</hi>
alwayes sent men of great iudgement with his Embassadours: for
whom hee had prepared Military habits, which were base, poore,
and seruile, to discouer and view the entries and issues of the two
Campes.<note place="margin">The Campe of <hi>Asdrubal</hi> of 30000. Foote and 3000. Horse.</note> There were in truth two: the one of <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thirty thousand Foote, and three thousand Horse: the other
which was ten Furlongs off, was of Numidians, hauing ten thousand
Horse, and about fifty thousand Foote. These had the approach
more easie,<note place="margin">The Campe of <hi>Syphax</hi> of 10000 Horse, and 50000. Foote.</note> and the Lodgings more fit to burne: for that the <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midians</hi>
vsed no Timber nor Earth, but onely Reeds and Canes to
make their Lodgings.</p>
            <p>And for that the Spring was come, <hi>Scipio</hi> hauing inquired of all
the preparations of the Enemy, hee causeth his shippes to flote, and
puts Engines into them as it were to besiege <hi>Bysarthe</hi> by Sea. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
hee seazed vpon a Hill neare vnto the City with about two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Foote, to the end hee might put a conceite into the Enemy,
that all this was done for the Siege: Yet in truth hee made this
Guard, vntill hee might haue an opportunity to execute his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
to the end that the Armies being out of their Camps, the
Garrison of the City should not dare to sally forth, nor assaile the
Pallisadoe being neare, nor besiege those which were there in the
Guard.</p>
            <p>This preparation being ready, hee sent to <hi>Syphax,</hi> to demand of
him if hee would conclude the Articles, and whether the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
did like of them: and that hee should propound nothing more
concerning the accord, giuing also charge to the Embassadours not
to returne without answere vpon these Differences. Being come
vnto the <hi>Numidian,</hi> their charge being heard, hee consented,
for that <hi>Scipio</hi> was ready to conclude this Accord: and withall the
Embassadours told him, that they would not depart before they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
backe an Answere from him.</p>
            <p>But being in great feare and doubt that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> would
not giue consent, hee sent with all speede vnto <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertising
him of that which was treated, with many perswasions
to accept of the Peace. <hi>Syphax</hi> was negligent and carelesse, and
suffered the <hi>Numidians</hi> which he had drawne together, to lodge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Campe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="419" facs="tcp:16537:216"/>
This <hi>Scipio</hi> did in shew, but hee was carefull of the preparations.
And when as the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had aduertised <hi>Syphax</hi> to conclude the
accord, reioycing thereat, he signified it presently to the Embassadors:
who being returned to their Campe, acquainted <hi>Scipio</hi> with that which
the King had done. These things being heard, hee presently sends
backe an Embassie to <hi>Syphax,</hi> to tell him, that hee liked well of the
accord, and desired a peace: but the Senate and Councell were not
of that Opinion, saying, that they would pursue their Enterprize.
The Embassie came to <hi>Syphax,</hi> and declared these things vnto him.
<hi>Scipio</hi> had sent these Embassadours, to the end hee should not seeme to
haue broken the accord, if during a parley of Peace, hee should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
any Enterprize of an Enemy: conceiuing that hauing signified
this vnto the Enemy, whatsoeuer he should doe would be blamelesse.
<hi>Syphax</hi> was much discontented with this newes, considering the
hope hee had of a Peace: Hee goes to <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> acquainting him
with that which the <hi>Romans</hi> had signified vnto him: whereupon
doubting, they consulted how they should carry themselues, but
they were farre from knowing the resolution and designe of the future
accidents. As for standing vpon their guard, or to beleeue that
any disaster or misfortune were at their Gates, they had no thought
thereof.</p>
            <p>It is true, their whole intent was to draw the Enemy into the
Plaine. <hi>Scipio</hi> gaue many presumptions by his preparation and sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
that hee had some Enterprize against <hi>Bysarthe,</hi> Finally, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Noone he sends for the Captaines Milleniers, whom hee held
for his loyall Friends, and acquaints them with his intent, giuing
them charge, that an houre after Dinner they should put the Army
in Battaile before the Pallisadoe, when as all the Trumpets accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to custome had giuen the Signe.<note place="margin">A custome of the <hi>Romans</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past.</note> The <hi>Romans</hi> haue a custome,
that during the repast, all the Trumpets and Clairons sound before the
Generals Tent: to the end that during that time they should set wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in conuenient places. When hee had retired his Spies which
hee had sent vnto the Enemies Campe, hee conferres and examines
the Reports of the Embassadours, and considers of the approaches
of the Campe,<note place="margin">Massanissa.</note> making vse therein of the aduice and councell of <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanissa</hi>
for the knowledge of the places. And when as all things were
ready for the Execution,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Scipio</hi> drawes to the Enemies Campe.</note> hee marcheth with his Army directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Enemy, the first Watch being changed, leauing a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
number to guard the Campe. They were threescore Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
off.</p>
            <p>And when they were come vnto them about the end of the third
Watch, he deliuers halfe the Army to <hi>Caius Lelyus,</hi> with all the <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midians,</hi>
giuing them charge to assaile <hi>Syphax</hi> Campe, and perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them to carry themselues like braue men, and not to attempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing rashly, holding for certaine that the more their sight is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
by darkenesse, the more courage and confidence they should
haue to finish Nocturnall assaults. Finally, hee assailes <hi>Asdru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
with the rest of the Army. Yet his purpose and resolution
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:16537:217"/>
was not to put it into execution, before that <hi>Lelius</hi> had first set fire of
the Enemies.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lelius</hi> assailes <hi>Syphax</hi> his Campe by fire.</note> Being thus resolued, hee marcheth a flow pace. <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
on the other side diuiding his Army in two, assailes the Enemies
suddainly. But as the lodgings were built in such sort, as if they
had of purpose beene destinated for the fire, where the first had cast
the fire, and consumed all the first Tents, it fell out so as they could
not succour this Disaster: Both for that the lodgings stood close to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and for the abundance of stuffe wherewith they were built.
<hi>Lelius</hi> stood still in Battaile: But <hi>Massanissa</hi> knowing the Countrey,
placed Souldiers vpon the passages, by the which they which fled
from the fire, must retire. Not any of the <hi>Numidians</hi> vnderstood
that which was done, nor <hi>Syphax</hi> himselfe, thinking this fire had
beene accidentall. Wherefore they goe rashly out of their lodgings
and Tents, some being yet asleepe, and others drinking: So as
many were crusht in peeces by them at the sally of the Pallisadoe, and
and many were burnt: In regard of those which fled the flames, they
were all slaine, falling into the Enemies hands, not knowing what should
befall them, nor what to doe.</p>
            <p>When at the same time the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> saw this great fire and
high flames, thinking the <hi>Numidians</hi> Pallisadoe was on fire, some
went presently to helpe them: all the rest ran out of the Campe
without Armes, standing before their Pallisadoe amazed, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
what the end would be.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Scipio</hi> sets <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubals</hi> Campe on fire.</note> When as things succeeded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <hi>Scipio's</hi> intent, he falls vpon those which were come out of the
Campe, and pursuing others into it, hee presently sets fire on their
lodgings. The like happened to the <hi>Phenicians,</hi> as well by fire as by
other miseries and misfortunes, where with the <hi>Numidans</hi> were
afflicted.</p>
            <p>But when as <hi>Asdrubal</hi> had discouered by the euent, that this fire of
the <hi>Numidians</hi> was not accidentall, but by the policy and courage
of the Enemy, hee ceased suddainly from giuing Succours, making
haste to saue himselfe, for that there was little hope remaining. The
fire suddainly wasted and consumed all: There were no more passages
for Horses, Sumpters, and men, among the which some were halfe
dead, and burnt with the fire, others were terrified and amazed, so
as they which made preparation to defend themselues valiantly, were
hindred, neither was there any meanes of hope, by reason of the
trouble and confusion.</p>
            <p>The like happened to <hi>Syphax</hi> and to the other Commanders. But
either of them escaped with some few Horses: the rest of the Troups
of Men, Horses, and Sumpters, perished miserably by this fire.
Some were ignominiously slaine by the Enemy after they had fled the
violence of the fire, and defeated not onely without Armes, but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and without apparrell. Finally, all the place of these Campes was
full of howling, horrible cries, feare, and vnvsuall noise: and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
with a violent flaming fire: Either of the which had beene suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to amaze and terrifie humane Nature, and the rather for that these
things happened contrary vnto all hope. Wherefore it is not possible
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:16537:217"/>
for any man liuing to imagine this accident, considering the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
for that it hath exceeded the policy of all precedent actions. And
although that <hi>Scipio</hi> hath performed many deeds of prowesse and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
yet this seemes to be the most excellent and hardy of them all. At
the breake of day the Enemies being some defeated, and others fled
with amazement, he gaue charge to the Commanders to pursue
the Chase.</p>
            <p>The Chiefe of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> budg'd not in the beginning, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he were aduertised by many: The which he did, relying vpon
the fortification of the City. But when hee saw the Mutiny of the
Inhabitants among themselues,<note place="margin">The flight of <hi>Asdrubal.</hi>
               </note> hee fled, accompanied with those
which had escaped with him, fearing the comming of <hi>Scipio.</hi> Hee
had fiue hundred Horse, and about two thousand Foote. The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
being agreed, yeelded themselues to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Whom <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi>
pardoned, abandoning the spoile of two Neighbour Cities to the
Souldiers. These things being thus decided, hee returned to his
first Campe. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were discontented, that the hope
which they had conceiued in the beginning, had succeeded so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
They expected to haue besieged the <hi>Romans</hi> (inclosed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Fort of <hi>Bysarthe,</hi> where they had wintred) as well by Sea as
Land. And when they had all their preparations ready, they were
not onely destitute of their Campes, so inconsiderately deliuered to
their Enemies, but it seemed they should all perish with their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey:
For this cause they were amazed with great feare and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of heart.</p>
            <p>And when as the affaires prest them to consider prudently of the
future and eminent danger, the Senate was full of doubt, and of diuers
confused thoughts: Some sayd, they must send to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and call
him out of <hi>Italy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Senate ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

and the Army which hee had: Others were of aduice they should
send to <hi>Scipio</hi> to obtaine a truce, and to parley of an accord and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
some would haue them to be of good courage, and to leuie an
Army, and finally to send to <hi>Syphax.</hi> He was fled farre vnto <hi>Abbe,</hi>
drawing together those which escaped from the danger: which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
was resolued. Wherefore they leuie men, and send to <hi>Asdru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
to that end, and likewise to <hi>Syphax,</hi> intreating him to giue them
Succours, and to obserue the conuentions according to their first
purpose, promising him that their Commander should presently
ioyne with his Army.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Generall followeth the Siege of <hi>Bysarthe</hi> the which hee
did the rather, for that hee was aduertised that <hi>Syphax</hi> continued in
his first resolution,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Scipio</hi> attends the <hi>Siege</hi> of By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarthe.</note> and that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> leuied a new Army.
For this cause hee raised his Campe and besieged <hi>Bysarthe.</hi> When hee
had diuided the spoile, hee chased away the Merchants vpon good
aduice. For the Souldiers carelesse of the present commodity of
goods: for that the hope of profits which grew by their good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
was apparent, they had intelligence with the Merchants.</p>
            <p>It seemed very fit to the King of <hi>Numidia</hi> and his Friends at
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:16537:218"/>
the first sight, that they should retire to their houses: But when the
<hi>Celtiberians</hi> arriued neare vnto <hi>Abbe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4000. <hi>Celtiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> come to succour the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>
               </note> who being entertained, were
aboue foure thousand men, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> grew assured, and by
little and little recouered their spirits, relying vpon these Troupes.
Moreouer, when as <hi>Pedisca</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> and Wife to
<hi>Syphax,</hi> (of whom we haue spoken) intreated him with all affection
that he would not abandon the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> for the present: The <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midian</hi>
yeelded to her intreaties. The <hi>Celtiberians</hi> put no small hope
into the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> For although they were but foure thousand,
yet they sayd, they were ten thousand. Finally, they promised to bee
insupportable in the fight, as well for their courage as their Armes. The
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> growne proud with this common bruite, were more
confident to recouer their Campes.</p>
            <p>Finally, they set vp their Pallisadoe within thirty dayes neare vnto
the Plaine called the Great, and there they planted their Campe, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with the <hi>Numidians</hi> and <hi>Celtiberians,</hi> being in number thirty
thousand men. When the newes came vnto the <hi>Romans</hi> Campe, <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi>
presently prepared to part. And when he had sent to those which
held the Siege before <hi>Bysarthe,</hi> and to the others which were at Sea,
informing them what they were to doe, he marched towards the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
hauing all his Bands furnished with the most valiant men.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Scipio</hi> drawes towards the Enemy.</note> Being
come on the fift Day to this great Plaine, and approaching neare the
Enemy, he camped the first Day vpon a Hill, thirty Furlongs distant
from them, the Day following hee descends into the Plaine, sending
the Horse-men before within seuen Furlongs, and there settles his
Campe againe.</p>
            <p>After two Dayes expectance, when they had skirmished of either
side to come to a Battaile, either of them in the end drew to Field, and
put their men in order. <hi>Scipio</hi> first of all placeth in Front his forlorne
hope,<note place="margin">The order of Battaile of the <hi>Romans</hi> Army.</note> according to their custome: After which he appoints the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals,
and in the third place the Triarij in the Reareward. As for the

in the midst, against the <hi>Romans</hi> Bands, the <hi>Numidians</hi> on the left
hand, and the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> on the right. Suddainly when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
began,<note place="margin">The beginning of the Battaile.</note> the <hi>Numidians</hi> were repuls'd by the <hi>Roman</hi> Horse-men, and
the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> (as they had often before) losing courage, were
ouerthrowne by <hi>Massanissa's</hi> Company. Yet the <hi>Celtiberians</hi> fought
valiantly against the <hi>Romans:</hi> for they had no hope of safety remaining

of <hi>Spaine,</hi> had not offended them, it seemed against reason, and a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty
to giue succours to the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> But when the Wings
began to giue backe, they were in a manner all slaine, being inclosed
by the Principals and the Triarij. Thus the <hi>Celtiberians</hi> perished,<note place="margin">The defeate of the <hi>Celtiberians.</hi>
               </note> who
were a great helpe to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> not onely in the fight, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in the flight, for if they had not entertained the <hi>Romans,</hi> and that the
Chase had beene suddainly followed, few of the Enemies had escaped:
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:16537:218"/>
but as their resistance caused the stay, <hi>Syphax</hi> retired safely with his

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Syphax</hi> retires in safety.</note> with the rest
which escaped. When as the <hi>Roman</hi> Generall had giuen order for
the spoiles and Prisoners,<note place="margin">The adulec of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </note> calling a Counsell, he consulted what there
was to do. Whereupon it was thought fit that <hi>Scipio</hi> should with part
of the Army assaile the Townes, and <hi>Lelyus</hi> with <hi>Massinissa</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied

               </note>
and not giue him leasure to make any new preparations. These things
thus resolued they separate themselues, and some goe against <hi>Syphax</hi>
with their Souldiers, and the Generall against the Cities: whereof
some yeilded to the <hi>Romans</hi> for feare, and others being forced by siege.
At that time the whole Region wauered and were ready to reuolt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
beene cruelly tormented and vexed during the length of the Wars
of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In regard of <hi>Carthage,</hi> as formerly there was great inconstancy, so
now there was greater trouble and combustion, for that hauing heard
and seene this Wound the second time, they grew desperate in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
It is true that they among the Councellours which seemed to
haue greatest Courage,<note place="margin">Diuers opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Warre.</note> commaunded that they should saile against
those which laid siege to <hi>Bysarthe,</hi> and to make a triall if they might
raise the siege, and to fight with the Enemy at Sea, as being ill furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.
They required also that they should send for <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
vpon that hope: and that there was reasonable occasions of safety by
these two attempts. Some said, that the time would not allow it, and
that they must fortifie and furnish the Citie for a siege: And that being
of one consent, the accident would minister occasions. Some also
aduise to make an Accord and League, whereby they should free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
of the eminent dangers.</p>
            <p>As there were many opinions vppon this businesse, they confirme
them all together. Wherefore this was their Resolution, they that
were to saile into <hi>Italy,</hi> parting from the Senate should go presently to
Sea: The Pylots likewise should prepare that which concernes the ships:
And the rest for the safetie of the Citie, hauing a daily care for parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
things. But when as the <hi>Roman</hi> Army was inricht with bootie,
and that no man made any resistance, <hi>Scipio</hi> resolues to send the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part of the bootie to the first baggage: And taking the ablest and

(hauing a good courage) seated his Campe in view of the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians.</hi>
He had a conceite that by this meanes hee should amaze and
terrifie them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> hauing in few daies giuen order for all the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page,

and also to signifie vnto them, that the people of <hi>Rome</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
their Accords, for they had lately brought Letters vnto <hi>Scipio</hi>
containing the said Articles. When the Embassadours were come to
<hi>Carthage,</hi> they were first brought vnto the Senate, and afterwards to
many others,<note place="margin">A remonstrance of the <hi>Roman</hi> Embassadours to the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians.</hi>
               </note> where they discoursed freely of the present Affaires.
First they put them in minde, how their Embassadours being arriued
at <hi>Tunis,</hi> and were come into the assembly of the Councell, they
had not only Sacrificed to the Gods, in bending downe to the ground,
as other men are accustomed to do: But moreouer (prostrating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
humbly) they had kist their feete: And when they were risen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
had acknowledged their faulte to haue broken the Accord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the beginning with the <hi>Romains,</hi> and that for this cause they
confest, that they were not ignorant, that they were lustly tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and that they intreated that by the Fortune of Humanes, they
might not be forced to suffer things that were not to be repaired, and
that by this meanes their indiscretion and rashnesse would make the
<hi>Romains</hi> bounty Commendable. The Embassadours say, that at the
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:16537:220"/>
repetition of these things, the Chiefe and Councellors which were
then present in Counsell, were amazed and wondred, with what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
they forgot things that were then spoken, and durst in manner
breake the Couenants sworne. It is in a manner manifest, that vpon
the confidence they had in <hi>Hannibal</hi> and his forces, they had presumed
to do these things, but inconsiderately. Finally, it was apparent to
all the World, that flying the last yeare out of all <hi>Italy,</hi> and being shut
vp through their faintnesse in the Countrey of <hi>Lacinium,</hi> and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
besieged, they are fallen at this day to that as they are hardly in
safety: And although that as Victors they would present themselues,
and trie with vs the fortune of the Warre, who haue vanquished you
in two following Battailes, yet they must not hold the future for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine:
Nor yet thinke of the Victory, but rather feare to be frustrated
againe. And if that hapned, to what Gods would they make their
prayers and vowes? In what Language would they speake, to mooue
the Victors to a Commiseration of their calamitie? Seeing that with
reason all hope would be taken away, aswell with the Gods as men.
These things thus propounded, the Embassadours foorth-with
depart.</p>
            <p>Some of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were of opinion that the Accord should
not be broken: The greatest part aswell of Burgesses as Senators, disli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
that to the Accord there were some grieuances added, and they
were much discontented at the hard reprehension of the Embassadors.
Moreouer they could not restore the shippes which had beene broken,
nor repay the Charges. They were likewise fed with no small hope of
<hi>Hannibals</hi> Victory. One part of them were of opinion to send away
the <hi>Roman</hi> Embassadors without answere. The Burgesses (whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
was howsoeuer to renew the Warne) consulting among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
practized in this manner. We must (said they) giue order that
the Embassadors may be safely sent backe to their Campe. Wherfore
they presently prepare two Gallies for their returne. But they aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
<hi>Asdrubal</hi> Chiefe of their Army at Sea,<note place="margin">A Conspiracy of the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi> against the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors.</note> intreating him to keepe
some vessells ready neere vnto the <hi>Romans</hi> Campe: to the end that
when the Marriners should abandon the Embassadors, these other
should board them, and cast them into the Sea. The Army at Sea
had ioyned to the <hi>Romans</hi> vpon the flat neere vnto <hi>Bysarthe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they had acquainted <hi>Asdrubal</hi> with these things they dismisse
the <hi>Romans:</hi> And giue charge vnto the Marriners of the Gallies, that
when they had past the Riuer of <hi>Macre,</hi> they should suffer the <hi>Romans</hi>
to Saile towards the Mountaine; for from thence they might visibly
discouer the Enemies Campe. When the Marriners had Conducted
the Embassadours, and according to their charge had crost the Riuer,
they turne head, hauing bid the <hi>Romans</hi> farewell. <hi>Lucius</hi> in trueth sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
no harme, but thinking to be thus left at Sea by the Marriners
through disdaine, he was much incensed. Whilest they sailed alone,
the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> present themselues with three Gallies, which assaile
the <hi>Roman</hi> Quinquereme, not able to annoy it nor board it, through
the great resistance which they made: And that fighting in Front and
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:16537:220"/>
vpon the flancke, they annoyed the Souldiers with great slaughter of
them: vntill being seene by those which spoiling the Maritine Country,
came running from their Campe to the Sea shore, they ranne the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
a shore. It is true, many of the Company were slaine, but the
Embassadours escaped beyond all hope.</p>
            <p>These things hapning, the Warie was againe renewed with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
violence and cruelty then before. The <hi>Romans</hi> intended with great
Courage to vanquish the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> seeing the faith violated. The
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> likewise fearing themselues guilty of that which they had
committed, were carefull not to fall into the Enemies subiection.
Their courages being such, it was apparent that this must be decided
by a Battaile: For this cause not only <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Affricke,</hi> but also <hi>Spaine
Sicily</hi> and <hi>Sardinia,</hi> were troubled and rauished in their iudgements, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
the end. And when at the same time <hi>Hannibal</hi> was destitute of
Horses, he sent to one <hi>Tycheus</hi> a Numidian allied to <hi>Syphas,</hi> who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to haue the most valliant of all the <hi>Affricane</hi> horse, perswading
him to giue him succours, and hee should be a sharer in the Action,<note place="margin">Hannibal <hi>sends to</hi> Tycheus.</note>
knowing that if the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> vanquished, his Principallity would
remaine safe and intire. But if the <hi>Romans</hi> preuailed, his life it selfe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
in danger, in regard of the ambition of <hi>Massanissa.</hi> Being thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
hee comes vnto <hi>Hannibal</hi> with about two Thousand
Horse.</p>
            <p>When as <hi>Scipio</hi> had fortified his Fleete at Sea, and left <hi>Bobias</hi> for
Lieutenant, he spoiled the Cities, refusing to receiue any that offered
themselues willingly, making them slaues,<note place="margin">Athia Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant at Sea for <hi>Scipio.</hi>
               </note> and shewing the indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which he had conceiued against the Enemies in regard of the faith
broken by the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> Finally, he sends continually to <hi>Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa,</hi>
letting him vnderstand how the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had broken the
Accords, intreating him to assemble the greatest Army that possibly
he could, and to ioyne with him, according vnto their conuentions.
<hi>Massanissa</hi> after the conclusion of the Accord, was gone with an Army
accompanied with ten Ensignes of <hi>Romans,</hi> aswell Horse as foote, not
only to recouer his owne Country, but also to seaze vpon those of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phax</hi>
with the helpe of the <hi>Romans.</hi> Finally it hapned that the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
sent backe from <hi>Rome</hi> Landed at that time at the maritine Palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sado
of the <hi>Romans,</hi>

the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> being sad and supposing to be in wonderfull

            <p>When as they were aduertized of the cruelty of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
towards the <hi>Roman</hi> Embassadours, they helde not themselues secure
from punishment. When as <hi>Scipio</hi> vnderstood what had beene done,
that the Senate and people of <hi>Rome</hi> had confirmed the agreement
which he had made with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and that they were ready
to do that which he aduised them, he was wonderfull glad. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
he commands <hi>Bebias</hi> to send backe the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Embassadours
to their Houses with all fauour and curtesie: Vsing therein a good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
(in my opinion) with a wise consideration in what great esteeme
his Country held their faith with Embassadors. Hee made his recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:16537:221"/>
that the punishment deserued by the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> did not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
so great a respect, then that which the honour of the <hi>Romans</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to be done. Wherefore refrayning his Choller and indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
conceiued for the offence of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> hee laboured to
obserue that which they say in the Prouerbe, <hi>That wee must cleaue vnto
the duties of our Elders.</hi> By this meanes he wonne the hearts of all the
<hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and surmounted <hi>Hannibal</hi> and their madnesse by his
Loyalty.</p>
            <p>When as the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> saw their Townes forced,<note place="margin">The <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </note> they sent to
<hi>Hannibal</hi> that hee should delay no longer, but present himselfe vnto
the Enemy, and decide their affaires by a battaile. <hi>Hannibal</hi> hearing
these things, made answere to those that came vnto him, that hee
would consider thereon, and make choise of a fit time, to the end he
might not seeme negligent. Some daies after hee raiseth his Campe
from <hi>Adrumetum,</hi> and marching he Campes neere vnto <hi>Zama,</hi> which
is a Citie fiue daies iourney from <hi>Carthage</hi> towards the West. From
thence he sent three Spies,<note place="margin">The Clemency of <hi>Scipio,</hi> vnto <hi>Hannibals</hi> spies.</note> desirous to know where the <hi>Romans</hi> campt,
and how they gouerne things which concerne the Scituation of a camp.
When these Spies were brought to <hi>Scipio</hi> Generall of the <hi>Romans,</hi> he
was so fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re from punishing them, as others vsually doe, as contrariwise
he gaue charge to a Captaine Milleniere, to shewe them plainely what
soeuer was done in the Campe. Which being done, he demaunds, if
the Commissary had shewed them all things carefully. The which
when they had confest, he sent them backe with Victualls and Guides,
commaunding them to relate carefully vnto <hi>Hannibal</hi> what they
had seene.</p>
            <p>This Action causing <hi>Hannibal</hi> to wonder at the magnanimity and
confidence of the man, he conceiued an humour to parly with <hi>Scipio.</hi>
The which when he had resolued, he sent a Trumpet, saying that he
desired to Treate with him concerning all their differences. <hi>Scipio</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
heard this from the Trumpet, consented, saying, that hee would
signifie vnto him the place and the howre, when and where he would
parly. These things being heard by the Trumpet he returnes vnto his
Campe. The day following <hi>Massanissa</hi> arriues with sixe Thousand
foote,<note place="margin">The comming of <hi>Massanissa</hi> to <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Camp.</note> and almost as many Horse: Whom when as <hi>Scipio</hi> had intertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

had made all those subiect which had formerly obeyed <hi>Syphax,</hi> hee
foorth-with raiseth his Campe: And when hee came vnto the City of
<hi>Margara,</hi> and had found a commodious place, and had appointed the
warring within a Bows shot, hee planted his Campe there: And from
thence he gaue notice (by certaine conuenient Messengers) vnto the
Chiefe of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> that hee was ready to parly about their
differences.</p>
            <p>The which <hi>Hannibal</hi> hearing, he presently marcheth with his camp,
and approaches so neere, as he was within thirty furlongs of the <hi>Romans:</hi>
Sitting downe vpon a certaine Hill, which besides the Watring, was
for all other things commodious and sufficient enough: In trueth it
was something farre, and therefore troublesome vnto the Souldiers.
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:16537:221"/>
The day following the two Commanders, accompanied with some
few Horse-men goe out of their Camps,<note place="margin">The enterview of <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Scipio.</hi>
               </note> and againe they separate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
from their Companies, meeting alone in an indifferent place with
an Interpreter. <hi>Hannibal</hi> began first in these termes. I wish sayd hee,
the <hi>Romans</hi> had neuer desired any thing out of <hi>Italy,</hi> nor the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi>
out of the limits of <hi>Affricke:</hi> either of them no doubt haue
great bounds, and as it were limitted by Nature<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibals</hi> Speech to <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio.</hi>
               </note> And as wee haue
made Warre, first for the difference of <hi>Sicily,</hi> then againe for <hi>Spaine:</hi>
and that finally, Fortune being auerse against vs, our Countrey hath
beene in danger, and wee are now in perill: The question is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be any meanes to end this present difference after we haue pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
the Gods.</p>
            <p>For my part I am ready, hauing made tryall how inconstant Fortune
is, and how by little and little shee inclineth sometimes to the
one, and sometimes to the other, as if she were gouerned by Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
I am in doubt in regard of thee, as well for thy great youth,
as for that all things haue succeeded according to thy desire, as well
in <hi>Affricke</hi> as in <hi>Spaine,</hi> hauing neuer yet felt the violence and fury
of Fortune, so as happily thou dost giue no credit to my words al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they bee true. Yet consider the condition of these things,
which not onely concerne our Ancestors, but euen our selues. I am
that <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who after the Battaile neare vnto <hi>Cannes,</hi> being Lord
in a manner of all <hi>Italy,</hi> approached neare vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> and planted my
Campe within forty Furlongs, studying what I should doe with you
and your Countrey.</p>
            <p>Now I come into <hi>Affricke</hi> to thee a <hi>Roman,</hi> to conferre with thee
of my lafety, and of that of the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> I pray thee consider
this, and grow not proud, but courteously conferre of the present af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires:
that is, that thou wouldst choose of good things the greatest,
and of bad the least. What man of iudgement will make choice of
the danger which is neare him, if hee obserue it well? For the which
if thou obtainest the Victory, thou shalt much increase thy glory,
and that of thy Countrey: whereas if thou beest vanquished, thou
shalt vtterly lose through thine owne fault all thy pompe and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
and precedent commodity.</p>
            <p>But to what end doe I vse these words? To this, that all that for
the which wee haue formerly contended, may remaine to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
as <hi>Sicily, Sardinia,</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> and that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in regard
thereof may neuer make Warre against them. The like also to be done
of the other Ilands which lye betwixt <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Affricke,</hi> and let
them belong to the <hi>Romans.</hi> I beleeue confidently, that these accords
and agreements will hereafter bring safety to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and
to thee and the <hi>Romans</hi> great glory and honour. Thus much spake
<hi>Hannibal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scipio</hi> answering to these things,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Scipio's</hi> answer to <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
               </note> the <hi>Romans</hi> sayd, they haue not
beene the Authors, but the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> of the Warre which hath
past for <hi>Sicily,</hi> nor of that of <hi>Spaine:</hi> whereof they must know
that <hi>Hannibal</hi> had beene the chiefe Author, and that the Gods
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:16537:222"/>
are witnesses, whom I pray to impart the vertue, not to those which
are the Authors of out-rages, but to those that defend themselues.
Yet I consider what the Nature of Fortune is, and with all my power
haue searcht into humane affaires. If before the <hi>Romans</hi> passage into
<hi>Affricke,</hi> and that parting out of <hi>Italy</hi> thou hadst propounded these
accords, I am of Opinion thou hadst not beene frustrated of thy hope.
But now thou hast abandoned <hi>Italy</hi> against thy will, and that being
in <hi>Affricke,</hi> we haue held our Campe in the open Plaine, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
that matters are much changed. Withall (which is a great matter)
we are come hither, thy Citizens being partly vanquished, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for a peace, we haue past in writing the accords that were sworne,
in the which (besides that which thou now propoundest) these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
were comprehended: that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> should haue no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
vessels, that they should pay three Millions of Gold, restore
the Captiues without Ransome,<note place="margin">Articles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, in the Accords past betwixt <hi>Scipio</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>
               </note> and giue hostages. These were the
accords which past betwixt vs: for the which wee and they came to
the Senate and to our people. Wee haue protested that that these
accords thus reduced to Writing seemed good vnto vs: The <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi>
intreated that they might enioy the said agreements: The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
obeyed, and the people in like manner gaue their consent
thereunto.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> after they had obtained what they had deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
haue transgressed and broken the accords. What remaines
now to be done? Be thou in my place and iudge. Shall wee take
the grieuances out of the conditions, to the end you may suffer no
punishments for the transgression, and that you may be taught here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
to preuaricare against your benefactors? Or else hauing obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that which you demaund you should not be bound vnto vs? But
what? When thy people now in suing had obtained their request, they
presently intreated vs as Enemies, after they had conceiued some
little hope of thee. If the burthens had beene too heauy, they might
haue required an abatement from the people: and if they had remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
any Articles of the accord, the Senate doubtlesse would haue
made no long delay. But to what end tend our words? Submit your
selues and your Country to our protection, or vanquish fighting.
<hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> hauing discoursed after this manner, being of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
opinions retire.</p>
            <p>The day following at Sunne-rising, they put their Armies into Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile,
whereof the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were to fight for their safety and for
<hi>Affricke,</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> for the vniuersall Empire. What is hee
who considering these things can without compassion heare the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
No man shall euer finde more warlike Armies, nor more fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Commanders, nor more excellent Wrestlers in the Stratagems
of Warre, nor greater rewards propounded vnto them by Fortune.
For they which should obtaine the Victory, should not onely bee
Lords of <hi>Affricke</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> but also of all the other parts of the
World which are at this time mentioned in Histories: the which soone
after succeeded, <hi>Scipio</hi> put his Army in Battaile after this manner.
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:16537:222"/>
First he ordred those that were lightly armed by certaine spaces:<note place="margin">The order of <hi>Scipio's</hi> Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile.</note> after

the Skirmish: and if they were repuls'd and forc'd to giue backe by
the violence of the Elephants, that they which should bee separated,
should retire by the straight spaces to the Reare of the Army: and they
which should be enuironed, should retire to the Ensignes by the
crosse spaces.</p>

                  <hi>Scipio's</hi> Speech to his Army.</note> he makes an Oration in few words
to his Army, and yet proper for the euent of the affaires. He intreats
them to remember their precedent Battailes, and to behaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
like braue men, worthy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Name, setting before
their eyes, that hauing the Victory they should not onely be Lords
of all <hi>Affricke,</hi> but moreouer they should purchase the Empire and
gouernment of the rest of the World. If the fortune of the Warre
succeeded otherwise, thee which dyed fighting valiantly, should
haue an honourable graue, hauing died for their Countrey: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they that should turne head, should liue the remainder of their daies
in great ignominy and misery, for there is no place in <hi>Africke</hi> that can
shelter them in theire flight, finally if they fall into the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
hands, they which haue any iudgement vnderstand well what the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
will bee: and God forbid that any of you should make triall of it,
when as fortune propounds vnto vs great rewards of euery side, shall
wee not bee the most simple Idiotts in the world, if when of good
things they present the best vnto vs, wee choose with a desire of life
the worst of bad? wherefore in propounding these two, either to
vanquish or dye, hee incourageth them to match against the enemy,
for being in this humour, they must with a dispaire of life, alwayes
vanquish their enemies in making head. <hi>Scipio</hi> inflamed the hearts
of his Souldiers after this manner.<note place="margin">The order of <hi>Hannibal</hi> his Battaile.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In regard of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> hee placed his Elephants before the whole
Army, being aboue foure score: and then about twelue thousand Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries,
which were <hi>Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

After which hee placed the Inhabitants of <hi>Affricke</hi> and
the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> After all which hee orders those which hee had
brought our of <hi>Italy,</hi> and feparates them from the rest aboue a
Furlong. Hee fortified the Wings with Horse-men, ordring the
<hi>Numidians</hi> on the right, and the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> on the left. Hee
commanded euery Leader to encourage his Souldiers, to the end
they might put their trust in him, and the Troupes which hee had
brought out of <hi>Italy.</hi> Hee likewise commands the <hi>Carthaginian</hi>
Captaines to acquaint their men with the miseries which would
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:16537:223"/>
befall their Wiues and Children, if this Battaile succeeded otherwise
then they desired. The which they effected. <hi>Hannibal</hi> likewise came
to them which hee had brought with him, and intreates them with a
long speech to remember their mutuall and common life, for the space
of seuenteene Yeares: That they should thinke of the many Battailes
which they had fought with the <hi>Romans,</hi> in the which they had
beene alwayes Victors, and had neuer left them any hope of Victory.
But hee intreated them chiefly, that amidst the encounter they should
set before their eyes the infinite prerogatiues: Namely, the Battaile
which they gained, fighting against the Father of this present <hi>Roman</hi>
Commander, neare vnto <hi>Trebia:</hi> Then that which was against <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius:</hi>
and also towards <hi>Cannes</hi> against <hi>Emilius:</hi> the which hee
sayd, were neither for the number and multitude of men, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
vnto their forces worthy to bee compared to the present
danger.</p>
            <p>When he had vsed this Speech, hee commands them to looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Enemies in Battaile, telling them that they were not onely few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in number, but they were scarce the least part of those which then
fought against them, and that they could not compare with them in
forces. And as the others were before inuincible, they had fought
cheerefully and stoutly, and that of these some were the Children of
men, and the others the Reliques of such as had beene often defeated
in <hi>Italy,</hi> and had so many times shewed them their heeles. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was of aduice that they should not doe any thing to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice
of their glory and fame, nor of their Commander: But in
fighting couragiously, confirme the opinion which was conceiued of
them to be inuincible. Behold the Speeches or such like which they
held vnto their Armies.<note place="margin">The beginning of the Battaile by the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants.</note> When as all things necessary were ready for
the Combat, and that the <hi>Numidian</hi> Horse-men had skirmished long:
<hi>Hannibal</hi> commanded those which were mounted vpon the Elephants
to charge the Enemy.</p>
            <p>But when the Trumpets and Clairons sounded, some of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
amazed, turn'd head, and went violently against the <hi>Numidians,</hi>
which were come to succour the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> Finally, the left
Wing of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> was left bare by <hi>Massanissa's</hi> Company.
The rest of the Elephants fighting with the Iauelings in the midst of
the Battalions, without doubt endured much, so likewise they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed
the Enemies: vntill that being amazed, some going forth by
the spaces were taken, as the Generall had giuen order: Others flying
on the right hand, and wounded by the Horse-men, passe in the end
the place of the Battaile. And when the Elephants were thus dismay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Lelyus</hi> charging the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Horse-men, repulseth them
in such sort, as they soone turned head, the Chase being pursued
by him.</p>
            <p>The like did <hi>Massanissa.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The strength of the Battaile.</note> Whilest these things are in action, the
two Battalions come to fight with a slow pace, and wonderfull
great courage, except those which were come out of <hi>Italy,</hi> who
budge not out of their place. When they came to affront one
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:16537:223"/>
another, the <hi>Romans</hi> crying after their Countrey manner, and
making their Targets sound with their Swords, fought with their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
The Mercenaries of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> cast forth diuers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
cries, for it was not the same sound, nor the same voyce; but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
languages: for they were men drawne from diuers Countries.
And when as this Battaile was fought with great courage, and man to
man, for that the Combattants could not helpe themselues with their
Iauelings nor Swords, the Mercenaries fought in the beginning with
great courage and dexterity, and wounded many <hi>Romans.</hi> The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
also trusting in their good order and Armes, laboured much to
goe on.</p>
            <p>And when as they which were in the Reare of the <hi>Romans,</hi> gaue
courage to the first in following them, and the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
on to succour their Souldiers, but staying behinde basely and
for want of courage, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> declined. Wherefore when
they saw themselues abandoned by their Companions, in retiring they
fell vpon those which stood still and slew them: the which forced
many <hi>Carthaginians</hi> to dye valiantly. For when they were slaine by
the Mercenaries, they fought boldly as well against their owne men
as against the <hi>Romans:</hi> In which combat (as they fought after a
horrible manner like furious men) they made no lesse slaughter of their
owne then of the Enemies. By this meanes they fell confusedly vpon
the Troups that were lightly armed. The Captaines of the Principals
seeing this accident, charg'd their Battalions. The greatest part of
the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and Mercenaries were slaine, aswell by them as
by those that were lightly armed.</p>
            <p>In regard of such as escaped and fled, <hi>Hannibal</hi> would not suffer them
to mingle with the Battalions, commanding their Captaines to rank<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
them before, and forbidding moreouer to receiue such as approacht:
wherefore they were forced to retire vpon the Wings, and without
them. But for that the place betwixt the two Armies was full of
bloud and dead bodies, this put the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Generall into great
difficulty, and was a great let for him to charge againe. For the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stability
of the dead which were bloudy and falne vpon heapes, with
the confusion of Armes which were fallen among the dead, they
were to haue a troublesome passage which marcht in Battaile. Yet
the wounded being carried backe, and a retreate being sounded by
the Trumpets which followed those that were lightly armed, hee
puts his men before the fight in the midst of the Enemy: In regard
of the Principals and Triarij, hee giues order that being closely
ioyn'd, they should march crosse the dead bodies vpon the two
Wings.</p>
            <p>When they were equall with those that were lightly armed, the
Battalions charged one another with great violence and courage.<note place="margin">The great fury of the fight.</note> It
happened that for the multitude, courage, and equall Armes of either
side, the Combat was long doubtfull. They that were slaine, dyed
euery man in his Ranke with a braue emulation, vntill that <hi>Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa</hi>
and <hi>Lelyus</hi> returning from the chase of the Horse-men, had by
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:16537:224"/>
good fortune rallied their men together: with whom charging vpon
the Reare of those which were with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> a great number of them
were defeated in Battaile; and few of them escaped which fled: For
the Horse-men were dispersed of all sides,<note place="margin">The victory of the <hi>Romans</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians.</hi>

plaine and Champion. There died aboue fifteene hundred <hi>Romans,</hi>

lesse. This Battaile in the which they fought for the Empire, and
which by the sayd Commanders was iudged the vniuersall victory to

               </note> had ouerthrowne their Pallisadoe, hee returned
to his Campe. <hi>Hannibal</hi> recouered <hi>Adrumetum,</hi> still running with
some few Horses. Hee had done his duty in this Battaile, not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that which was requisite for a good an expert Captaine.</p>
            <p>For first he laboured to diuert the eminent danger by a parley with

but distrusting Fortune, to fore-see things which contrary to all
opinions doe vsually happen in a Battaile. And afterwards comming
to the Combat, he so carried himselfe, as the Battaile could not be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ordered against the <hi>Romans</hi> by him that shall vse the like Armes, then
<hi>Hannibal</hi> had then disposed it. For when the Army and order of the
<hi>Romans</hi> was diuided, it fell out that all of them might fight together,
or by Troups against any open attempt, by a certaine order of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion:
for that alwayes two Ensignes were ioyned neare together when
it was needfull, and that moreouer their Armes serued the Souldiers for
a couering and assurance, considering the greatnesse of their Targets,
and the firmnesse of their Swords to strike, so as for these reasons it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
a difficult thing to defeate them. Yet <hi>Hannibal</hi> gaue so good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for all these things, as he shewed his industry. For he had suddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prepared this multitude of Elephants, and placed them before his
Battalions, to the end they might breake the Enemies Rankes. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
he ordred the Mercenaries in Front, after which he caused the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> to march, to the end they might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ite the bodies of the
Enemies, and make the vigour of their Armes vnprofitable, by reason
of the number of the Dead, and that withall hee should force the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi>
(as placed in the midst) to stand in Battaile, and to
fight vntill that forced by necessity he should come to combat. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the valiant men, hee mingled them by spaces: fore-seeing that
which doth vsually happen, to the end that remaining vndanted both
in body and courage, he might make vse of their forces at need. He
deserues pardon in this, that hauing omitted nothing that might serue
to vanquish, yet he hath beene frustrated, seeing that before hee had
beene inuincible. It happens sometimes that some actions resist the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of good men: and sometimes it happens that a good man is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented
of his desire by him that is better: the which may then be sayd

            <p>
               <hi>Scipio</hi> beginning in few words, let them vnderstand that hee was
not to shew them any courtesie or fauour, seeing they confest they
had begunne the Warre against the <hi>Romans,</hi> and against the conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
had spoil'd the City of the <hi>Zachantiens,</hi>

the Accords, Oathes, and Agreements reduced to Writing: And
yet the <hi>Romans</hi> haue resolued to shewe them grace, and (in regard of

they consider what was offered. Finally they must not take it ill if for
the present they imposed vpon them things, which they must doe, or
suffer, or deliuer: But they should wonder and hold it strange, if
they obtaine any mercy: Seeing that Fortune dis-fauouring them for
their iniustice, had (in denying mercy and pardon) made them subiect
vnto their Enemies.</p>
            <p>This Speech being ended, hee promised them Clemency and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour:
Teaching them withall what they were to indure: The which is
comprehended in these Articles.<note place="margin">The Articles of Accord, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by <hi>Scipio</hi> to the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>

held, and finally their Cattle, Bodies, and other Wealth. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
it was granted them, that from that day they might liue free with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any let or hinderance of their Lawes and Customes. This was
that which was granted them of grace. Againe they added these
contrary Articles: That the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> should make restitution, of
the vniust spoiles which they had committed against the <hi>Romans</hi> during
the Truce: That they should restore all the Captiues and Fugitiues,
which they had had during the Warre: They should deliuer all their
long Vessels except ten Gallies: And in like manner the Elephants: not
to attempt to make any Warre out of <hi>Affricke,</hi> nor in <hi>Affricke</hi> it selfe
without the consent of the <hi>Romans:</hi> To restore vnto King <hi>Massanissa,</hi>
the Houses, fields, Cities, and whatsoeuer had belonged to him or
his Predecessors, within the limits that should be set downe: That
they should nourish the Army for three moneths, and pay them vntill
the answere were returned from <hi>Rome:</hi> And according vnto the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
pay sixe Millions of Gold, within fifty Yeares, after the rate of

that if he had committed any thing against their Custome and

a young Boy of nine yeares of age, he had gone out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and returned againe at the age of fiue and forty: For this cause
he intreated them that they would not haue any regard to that, wherein
he had transgrest their Custome, considering rather that if he suffered
for the affaires of the Country: It was for them he had fallen into this
transgression. Finally that it seemed wonderfull and strange to him, if
any <hi>Carthaginian</hi> knowing what Councell had beene taken against the
<hi>Romans,</hi> aswell for the publicke as priuate good, did not adore For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:
Seeing that now being made subiect vnto them, they had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
such grace and fauour: Whereof if any one would haue put the

would not haue beene able to speake for the greatnesse and excesse of the

            <p>Wherefore he intreated them againe, not to do any thing slowly,

the people of <hi>Rome</hi> might confirme them. When it seemed that hee

               <p>Moreouer, he incensed the <hi>Rhodiens</hi> against him: so as they could
not endure to heare any mention of him. Finally, Fortune therein fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
him openly. His Embassadour made an Oration vpon the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater
against the <hi>Rhodiens,</hi> commending the magnificence of <hi>Philip,</hi>
who when he had by some meanes got possession of the City, he had
done that grace vnto the people. This he did to reprehend the suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
and detraction of those which resisted him, and to manifest his
resolution to the City. There came also some one from the Port vnto
the Magistrate, aduertising him of the ruine of the <hi>Cianeins,</hi> and
of the cruelty which <hi>Philip</hi> practised against them: So as when the
Gouernour entring in the midst of the Embassadours Oration, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the said things, and declared the newes, the <hi>Rhodiens</hi> could not
beleeue for the excesse of the fact.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> hauing then preuaricated and dissembled, not so much against
the <hi>Cianeins</hi> as against himselfe, began to be so transported and to stray
from his duty, as hee gloried and brag'd in his actions as good, for the
which hee should haue beene ashamed.<note place="margin">The <hi>Rhodiens</hi> declared Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to <hi>Philip.</hi>
                  </note> The <hi>Rhodiens</hi> from that day
held <hi>Philip</hi> for an enemy, and prepared to that end. The <hi>Etoliens</hi>
also conceiued a hatred against him for the same fact. When as late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
being reconciled, he had giuen forces to that Nation, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then no cause of hatred nor spleene, (when as a little before the
<hi>Etoliens,</hi> the <hi>Lysimacheins, Calsidoniens,</hi> and <hi>Cianeins</hi> were made
Friends) hee hath in assailing first the <hi>Lysimacheins,</hi> distracted their
City from the Alliance of the <hi>Etoliens:</hi> spoiling those of the <hi>Calsido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niens,</hi>
and thirdly the <hi>Cianeins,</hi> whilest that the Chiefe of the <hi>Etoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens</hi>
was resident in their City, hauing the superintendency of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
affaires.</p>
               <p>Finally <hi>Prucias</hi> reioyced for that which had hapned beyond his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires:
But he was discontented that another should reape the reward for
the taking of the Citie, and that there was fallen vnto him a desolate
place naked of buildings, so as hee could not effect any thing. After
he had assembled the greatest men of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> he came to them
with the King and <hi>Agathoclia,</hi> faining in the beginning that hee was
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:16537:226"/>
not able to speake for teares: And when he had wiped them often with
his cloake, and caused them to cease, take saith he, carrying an infant,
this which the dying Father hath deliuered into the armes of this Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(shewing his sister) and hath left it vnto vs vpon our faith, do you
vnderstand my masters of the <hi>Athenians?</hi> The loue of this infant is
of small moment to procure his safetie, where as now the cause is in
you and your hands. <hi>Tlepoleme</hi> in truth hath for a long time (as it is
manifest to those which consider well of things) had greater desires then
were fitting, and hath now resolued on the day and time when he will
vsurpe the Towne. For this cause hee intreated that they would not
belieue him, but those which being present knew sufficiently the
Truth.</p>
               <p>This Speech being ended, he brings in <hi>Critolaus,</hi> who said he had
seene the Altars and Sacrifices, prepared by the multitude, for the vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of the Crowne. The which the <hi>Macedonians</hi> hearing, they
were neither mooued with pittie, nor had any respect vnto that which
was spoken. But in mocking and murmuring they iested among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
so as <hi>Prusias</hi> knew not how he got out of the Assembly; the
which hapned in other Assemblies of the people. In the meane time
many of the old Souldiers arriued by Sea, whereof some being kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and other friends, they intreated them to assist them in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
businesse, and that they should haue regard to the iniuries which
had beene done them by dishonest and vnworthy men. Most of them
were incensed to put the great men to death: for that they presumed
that what should happen would be vnto their preiudice: Seeing that
<hi>Tlepoleme</hi> tooke all things necessary that were sent to <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
it was an aduancement to <hi>Agathocles</hi> to incense the Choller of
many, and of <hi>Tlepoleme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They had put <hi>Danae</hi> his Mother in Law into custodie, being pull'd
from the Temple of <hi>Ceres,</hi> and drawne thorough the Citty bare-hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
seeking by this meanes to shewe their hatred against <hi>Tlepome.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Danae</hi> a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner.</note>
Wherefore the people being incensed spake no more in secret: For
some in the night wrote their conceiued hatred in all places. Others in
the open day going in Troupes, deliuered the hatred which they bare
vnto the greatest. They which were with <hi>Agathocles,</hi> seeing the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
and hauing little hope in them, they thought of their retreate.
But when as through their indiscretion they were ill prouided, they
desisted from their Enterprize, and made a Register of the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators
and of their Adherents in this commotion, to the end they might
suddainly kill some of their Enemies, and seaze vpon others, and by
this meanes vsurpe a Tyrannicall power.</p>
               <p>And as they practized these things, they accused <hi>Moeragena</hi> one of
<hi>Tlepolemes</hi> guards, for that he aduertized all, and held his party in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the familiaritie of <hi>Adee,</hi> Gouernour at that time of <hi>Bubaste,
Agathocles</hi> suddainly giues charge to the Secretary <hi>Nicostrates,</hi> that he
should informe dilligently of <hi>Moeragena,</hi> with all manner of torments.
<hi>Moeragena</hi> being suddainly taken by <hi>Nicostrates,</hi> and led into a certaine
secret place of the Hall, he answered at the first well, concerning the
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:16537:227"/>
accidents which had happened: But when hee confest nothing of the
things which were spoken, he was stript. Some prepared the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to Torture him, others holding Whips put off their Cloaks. At
the same instant one comes running to <hi>Nicostrates,</hi> and after hee had
whispered in his eare, he parts in hast. <hi>Nicostrates</hi> followes him sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
without speaking word, beating continually vpon his thigh.
This was an vnhoped accident for <hi>Moeragena.</hi> For some held the
Whips, but they had no Commandment to whip him, others had
the instruments ready to torture his feet.</p>
               <p>When as <hi>Nicostrates</hi> was gone, they were all amazed, and looking
one vpon another expected when he would returne. Soone after the
assistants vanished one after one,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Moeragena</hi> saues himselfe naked.</note> and in the end <hi>Moegarena</hi> was abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
This done, he passeth the Hall contrary to all Hope, and being
naked slipt into a certaine Tent of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> neere vnto the Hall.
When by good fortune he had found the greatest there assembled, hee
acquaints them with his disaster, and how he had escaped, as it were,
by miracle. Some of them did not belieue him, others seeing him
naked were forced to giue credite. <hi>Moeragena</hi> intreates them with
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eares, not onely to haue a care of his safety, but also of the Kings
and their owne: And that their Death was manifest, if they did not
make vse of the occasion, for that all the World was inflamed with
Hatred, and there was not any man but was ready to put <hi>Agathocles</hi>
to Death, saying that this Hatred increased Hourely, and that they
must haue men to execute this Enterprize.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Macedonians</hi> hearing this Speech were incensed, and in the end
obeying to <hi>Moeragena:</hi> They suddainly enter into the first Tents of the
<hi>Macedonians,</hi> and then into those of the other Souldiers. They were
ioyning and neere to the side of the Citie. When as many of them
tooke vpon them the Charge, and that there was no need of any thing
but of some one, to giue courage to them that came, and who should
first execute the Enterprize, this attempt kindled like a flame. There
were scarce foure houres spent, but that all men aswell Souldiers as
Citizens, conspired to assaile <hi>Agathocles.</hi> There was a accident which
hapned suddainly, which serued well to end this attempt. For when
they had brought Letters to <hi>Agathocles,</hi> and that the Spies were retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and the Letters sent by <hi>Tlepoleme,</hi> signified vnto the Army that
he would be soone there, being likewise assured by the Spies that hee
was neere, he fell into so great a transport in his iudgement, as hee
neither did nor thought of any remedy against the eminent dangers,
but following his accustomed course, hee went to drinke and banquet
with others.</p>
               <p>And when <hi>Oenanthe</hi> was sad and sorrowfull,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Oenanthe</hi> sad.</note> shee goes vnto <hi>Ceres</hi>
Temple. Where (when it was opened for a certaine Annuall Sacrifice)
she prayes humbly, then she vseth Enchauntments towards the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desses,
finally shee stayes at the Altar and rests there. Many Women
were silent and obserued her heauinesse and affliction. The kinsfolkes
of <hi>Polycrates,</hi> and some other Noble men comforted her, and being
ignorant of the approaching misery. She on the other side crying out
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:16537:227"/>
with a loud voice, <hi>Come not neare me you Beasts:</hi> I know well you are
ill affected towards vs, and that you require the Gods to send vs some
ill Fortune: But I hope that with their good pleasure you shall taste
of your owne Children. Hauing ended this Speech, shee commands
the Executioner to suppresse them, and if they did not obey, to beate
them. Taking this occasion they all depart, and in lifting vp their
hands towards the Gods, they prayed that shee might make tryall of
that which shee had wisht to the Company.</p>
               <p>But when the men had concluded the reuolte, and that in euery
house the fury of the Women was added thereunto, their hatred
grew double. When as the darkenesse of the Night was come, the
whole City was fill'd with Mutiny, lights,<note place="margin">A mutiny of the people.</note> and running vp and
downe. Some assembled at the Theater with cries, others encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
one another, and some ran to hide themselues in houses, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that were not suspected. And when the spacious places about the
Hall; the place for running of Horses, and the Court about <hi>Dyonisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
Theater, were fill'd with a multitude of all sorts of men. <hi>Agathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
hearing this, riseth vp being drunke, after that hee had emptied
his gorge, and came vnto the King after hee had taken all his Kinsmen
except <hi>Philon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After hee had vsed some Speech mouing to compassion, hee takes
him by the hand, and leads him to the Armory of lauelings, seated
betwixt the top and the wrestling place, and which bends by the
way of the Theater: And after hee had opened two Doores, hee
came to the third, accompanied with two or three of the Guard and
his Kinsmen. These Doores were transparent and shut with double
Barres. And when at that time all the Commons of the City were
there assembled, so as not onely the places were full of men, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the passages and tops of houses, there grew a confused cry and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Women and Children, with the men in this Mutiny, as
well of them of <hi>Chalcedonia,</hi> as of <hi>Alexandria</hi> mingled together. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
Sun-rising the cry was confused: yet the chief<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> sound was, that they
called for the King.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Macedonians</hi> rising first, seaze vpon the Ports of the Kings
Treasure. But when they vnderstood in what part of the Pallace the
King was, turning to the first Doores of the first Armory, they beate
them downe. And when they were come vnto the second, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the Infant with a great cry. <hi>Agathocles</hi> seeing what would
befall him, intreates the Guard to intercede for him to the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians,</hi>
letting them vnderstand, that hee would relinquish the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
of the Infant, with his power and dignity, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
all the gouernment: intreating them to bee so fauourable
vnto him, as to saue his life, affoording him necessary Victuals
and the like, returning vnto his ancient and former course of life,
and that hee would not (nay he could not) offer offence or wrong
vnto any man whatsoeuer.</p>
               <p>None of the Guards pittying him in his distresse, wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="442" facs="tcp:16537:228"/>
Gouernour of the publicke affaires. He was an <hi>Acarnanian,</hi> and
as he was aduanced in yeares, hauing the superintendency of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
hee was held a good Gouernour to the King and royall Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace:
And in the meane time he had respect to the prosperity of <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thocles:</hi>
for he was the first who calling vnto him <hi>Agathocles,</hi> hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
had a Crowne of Gold by all the assistants: the which they vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
doe onely to Kings. Finally, hee was the first that durst carry a
Ring with <hi>Agathocles</hi> Image. And when hee had a Daughter by
his Wife, hee called her <hi>Agathoclea.</hi> But we haue spoken sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of this Subiect.</p>
               <p>Hee therefore hauing taken charge of <hi>Agathocles</hi> commandment,
and going forth at a Posterne, he came vnto the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> When
he had vsed some little speech, and declared the Will of <hi>Agathocles,</hi>
the <hi>Macedonians</hi> sought to kill him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when as many put forth
their hands to defend him, they enquired the Opinion of the rest,
which being vnderstood, he returned to <hi>Agathocles,</hi> hauing charge
to come backe with the King, or else to returne no more. The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians</hi>
hauing giuen this Answer, sent backe <hi>Aristomenes,</hi> and
assailing the second Doore, they vnhang it. Wherefore they which
were with <hi>Agathocles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> seeing the violence of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> as well
by their actions as by their answere, comming first to the Doore, lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vp their suppliant hands: <hi>Agathoclea</hi> likewise shewed the Papps
wherewith shee sayd shee had giuen the King sucke, intreating the
<hi>Macedonians</hi> with a mournefull and miserable voice, onely to saue her
life. And when as by the great lamentations of her Fortune shee
had preuailed nothing, in the end they draw forth the Infant with his
Guards.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Macedonians</hi> presently set the King on Horse-backe, and lead
him to the Theater. Assoone as hee was discouered, they stay his
Horse with great clamors and ioy, and taking him downe they set
him in a royall Chaire. In the meane time the Commons partly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce,
and were partly sad. They reioyced for the comming of the
Infant: againe, they were sad and grieued for that they which were
the Offendors, had not beene taken and punished accordingly. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
crying continually, they required that they might bee brought
and exemplarily punished by an Ignominious and reproachfull Death,
as the Authors of all their miseries and troubles. But when the Day
was farre spent, the Mutiny of the people could not be pacified by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
meanes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sosibius</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Sosibius,</hi> then Captaine of the Guard, hauing
the principall charge of the Kings affaires, seeing that the Mutiny of
the people could not bee pacified, and the Infant grew sad through
the insolency and nouelty of the present affaires, and the trouble of the
Commons, hee demanded of him if hee would not deliuer vnto the
people those which had offended against him or his Mother. And
when hee consented, hee commanded the Guards to make the Kings
will knowne: And then they tooke the Infant in his Chaire, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
him to his owne house.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="443" facs="tcp:16537:228"/>
But when the Kings pleasure was divulged and made knowne by the
Guards, all the place was full of ioy and exclamations. They which
were with <hi>Agathocles</hi> and <hi>Agathoclea,</hi> retired presently to their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
The Guards presently forced some of them, and others were
thrust on by the people, to seeke them out and kill them. Whereof
the beginning was by an accident.</p>
               <p>One of the Guard, and a follower to <hi>Agathocles</hi> named <hi>Phylon,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
yet full with Drinke, came forth into the place. Who when
hee saw the Mutiny of the people, hee sayd vnto the assistants, that if
euer <hi>Agathocles</hi> came forth againe as hee had done, they would repent
it. They which heard him, some blamed him, others thrust him,
and when hee offred to defend himselfe, some suddainly teare his
Cloake, others slew him miserably with their Iauelings.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phylon</hi> slaine.</note> Whilest
they drag'd him about the place yet breathing, and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
had tasted the fury of striking, they expect hourely to haue
the rest brought.</p>
               <p>Soone after <hi>Agathocles</hi> was the first, beeing bound and manna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled:
who going on was suddainly thrust thorough by some one,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Agathocles</hi> slaine.</note>
wherein hee performed the part of a Friend, and not of an Enemy.
For by this meanes they preuent his worthy punishment. They
brought with him <hi>Nicon</hi> and <hi>Agathoclea</hi> naked with her Sisters, and
consequently all their Parentage: Finally, they drawe <hi>Oenanthe</hi>
out of the Temple,<note place="margin">

Fables and colours some Historiographers vse in these actions, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze

               <p>Some referre this accident to Fortune, shewing how inconstant and

It is true that in the pursuite of this Worke I had resolued to helpe my

for his courage and prowesse in the Warre, neither any

               <p>Hauing therefore gotten this occasion to come vnto greatnesse,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:16537:229"/>
when as after his Death hee had a fit opportunity offred to maintaine

slaine within a short time.<note place="margin">Agathocles <hi>and</hi> Denis Sicilians.</note> Wherefore it is not fitting, that in the
relation of such things they should adde words: especially when they
speake of such as <hi>Agathocles</hi> and <hi>Denis Sicilians,</hi> with some others,
which had beene famous and renowned for their actions. One of
them in truth came of a base extraction: But as <hi>Tymeus</hi> cauells,

               <p>Wee must in truth when the proposition is made, hold the

euents, which haue nothing but a conceite worthy to hold the
Reader in suspence. Finally, it is not onely vnprofitable to treate
of them with a long discourse, but also their vehemency in the end
brings tediousnesse and trouble. There are two ends, namely,
profit and pleasure:<note place="margin">Two ends in Histories.</note> whereunto they must haue regard which will
ruminate any thing either of hearing or sight.</p>
               <p>And for that profit belongs chiefly to the narration of an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
it is most necessary and conuenient, that this kind of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of words vnto fearefull accidents, should turne from these
two ends. What is hee that would willingly follow vnexpected
accidents, and without reason? No man reioyceth continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
eyther for the seeing or hearing of things which are out of
Nature and the common sence of men: But in the beginning
wee are exceeding ioyfull and glad to see some, and to heare o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to the end wee may rightly vnderstand and know after
what manner that is done which seemes vnto euery one very strange
and impossible.</p>
               <p>When wee once begin to know them, no man takes any delight
or pleasure to stay vpon things which are strange from the course of
Nature, nor will haue any desire to fall often vpon the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.
Wherefore the Narration must drawe a desire of imitation
where hee may delight. And if they adde words to some miserable
accidens besides these ends, they are more fitting for a Tragedy then
a History.</p>

Peraduenture you must pardon those which doe not consider things
which are common to Nature and the World: But they hold the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
of their Ancestors great and wonderfull, whereon falling by
Fortune in Reading or Hearing them from others, they settle their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.
Wherefore they know not, that they vse more speech
of such things then is needefull, which are neither

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Hilip</hi> was much troubled, seeing many
things succcede vnfortunately in his siege,
and withall that the Enemies were in the
Hauen with a good number of couered
Vessells, neither could hee well resolue
what to do. And when as the present oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
depriued him of all meanes of
choice, in the end hee weighed Anchor,
and set Saile contrary vnto the Enemies
Hope. For <hi>Attalus</hi> and his Company ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
that he should grow obstinate at the Siege, considering the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
which he had of Engines of Battery. <hi>Philip</hi> made all haste to
saile away, imagining that hee might get before them, and make a
safe retreate vnto <hi>Samos</hi> along the shore: Yet hee was deceiued in his
conceite. For when as <hi>Attalus</hi> and <hi>Theophiliscus</hi> saw that hee had
weighed Anchor, they suddainly resolued and set Saile, obseruing no
order,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Attalus</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth <hi>Philips</hi> Army at Sea.</note> for that they conceiued that <hi>Philip</hi> would haue perseuered in
his Enterprize. Yet they charge him making great speed with their
Oares: So as <hi>Attalus</hi> fell vpon the right wing which got before, and
<hi>Theophiliscus</hi> vpon the left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> seeing himselfe thus pestred, and suddainly surprized, hee
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:16537:230"/>
gaue the signe of the Battaile to them of the right wing, commanding
them to turne their prowes against the Enemies, and to charge them
resolutely: Then he retired to the smaller Ilands, which were in the
mid-way with the lighter Vessels,<note place="margin">The number of <hi>Philips</hi> ships and of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</note> expecting the end of the Battaile.
The number of Ships of Warre which <hi>Philip</hi> had, were fifty three co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer'd
Vessels, with a hundred and fifty Foists and Galleyes vncouered.
In regard of the Vessels remaining at <hi>Samos,</hi> hee could not arme them.
Those of the Enemies were in number threescore Vessels couered, with
those of <hi>Constantinople:</hi> with the which there were nine Galliots and
three Galleyes.</p>
               <p>When as <hi>Attalus</hi> Ships began the fight, presently they that were
neare, charge one another without command. <hi>Attalus</hi> fell vpon a Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
with eight Oares, crushing it in such sort as it tooke water: and
when as they which were vpon the hatches, had defended themselues
long, in the end hee sunke it. On the other side <hi>Philips</hi> Galley of ten
Oares, which was the Admirall, was by chance taken by the Enemies:
For when as a Galliot sayl'd against it, it bruised it much in the midst
of the Bulke, ioyning vnto it behind at the poope, to the which it
remain'd grapled, for that the Pylot could not stay its violence. So
as when this Vessell stucke close vnto her, she was much hindred, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could they gouerne nor turne her. In the meane time two Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queremes
charge her, and bruising her in two places, sinke her with the
Souldiers. Among the which was <hi>Democrites,</hi> Captaine Generall at
Sea for <hi>Philip.</hi> At the same instant <hi>Dionysodorus</hi> and <hi>Dynocrates</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
(who were Commanders of the Army vnder <hi>Attalus</hi>) giuing
a charge,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Democrates</hi> Captaine Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall to <hi>Philip,</hi> sunkt.</note> found themselues in great danger in the fight: So as <hi>Dynocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
gaue charge to a Vessel with seuen Oares, and <hi>Dionisodorus</hi> to one of
eight. <hi>Dynocrates</hi> was broken aboue water, and that of the Enemy
vnder the water, yet he could not free himselfe from them, although
hee had often attempted it in sawing.</p>
               <p>Wherefore when as the <hi>Macedonians</hi> defended themselues valiantly,
he was in danger to be taken. But for that <hi>Attalus</hi> came to succour
him, charging the Enemy, and parting the two ships which were
grapled, <hi>Dynocrates</hi> saued himselfe by good fortune. In regard of the
Enemies, they were all slaine fighting valiantly: so as the Vessell being
destitute of Souldiers, was taken by <hi>Attalus.</hi> And when as <hi>Dionisodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
sayl'd with great swiftnesse to fight, hee could not ouertake any,
and passing through the Enemies he had the Pallisadoe on the right
side disarmed, and the Beames broken which carried the Tower. This
happening he was inuested round by the Enemy with great noise and
cries. All the Marriners perisht with the Ship, and <hi>Dionisodorus</hi> swum
away with two others vnto a Galliot which came to succour him. In
regard of the other Vessels the danger was equall: For as the number of
<hi>Philips</hi> Foists was greater, so was that of <hi>Attalus</hi> in couer'd Vessels.
Finally, the Combat was so carried vpon <hi>Philips</hi> right Wing, as the
Victory inclined to neither. It is true that <hi>Attalus</hi> was in better hope
for the future.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rhodiens</hi> in the beginning of the party separated themselues
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:16537:231"/>
from the Enemies, who hauing a great aduantage by the lightnesse of
their Vessels, fought against the <hi>Macedonians</hi> making the Reare-ward.
And when in the beginning they fell to flight, they carried away all
their defences, charging them behinde and in poope. But when as
<hi>Philips</hi> Vessels began to turne head altogether, giuing aide to those
which were in danger, and that the Reare of the <hi>Rhodiens</hi> were ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to <hi>Theophiliscus:</hi> then they charged with great fury, encouraging
one another with great shouts and Trumpets. And if the <hi>Macedonians</hi>
had not mingled their Foists among their couered Vessels, the Battaile
had beene soone decided: for they tooke from the <hi>Rhodien</hi> ships all
commodity in diuers sorts: For that when as by either side the order
was broke, they were all mingled. Wherefore they could not easily
enlarge themselues, nor turne their Vessels, nor assist themselues with
those meanes whereof they were best prouided, for that the Foists did
continually charge them, sometimes falling vpon the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>llisadoe, so as
they could make no vse of their Rowers, and sometimes vpon the prow
and poope, to depriue them of their Pylot and Oares. And when as
they fought in a direct line, they inuented a stratagem: for abating the
prowes they made their charge fruitlesse, breaking the Enemies Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
vnder water: To preuent the which they could finde no remedy.
It is true, this happens seldome for that all auoided the encounter, for
that the <hi>Macedonians</hi> fought valiantly hand to hand, and most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in passing they razed the Pallisadoe, making it vnprofitable. Then
suddainly casting about, they assailed those that were in poope: and
likewise giuing charge to those which shewed themselues vpon the
flankes, or which turned aside, they brake some, and tooke the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page
from others: so as fighting after this manner, they had sunke di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
of the Enemies Vessels.</p>
               <p>There were three excellent Quinqueremes of the <hi>Rhodiens</hi> in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
whereof the Admirall was one, in the which <hi>Theophiliscus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded:
Then that whereof <hi>Philostrates</hi> was Captaine, and the the third
was gouerned by <hi>Antolice:</hi> in the which <hi>Nycostrates</hi> remained. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that shee gaue a charge to one of the Enemies Vessels, where she
left her spurre, so as it sunke with the Souldiers: And <hi>Antolice's</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
being inuested, for that they tooke water at the prowe, defended
themselues valiantly: But <hi>Antolice</hi> being wounded fell into the Sea with
his Armes and died, the rest fighting with great courage. At what
time <hi>Theophiliscus</hi> comming to succour them with three Quinqueremes,
he could not saue the ship being full of water</p>
               <p>After that he had broken two of the Enemies Vessels, and cast the
Souldiers into the Sea, hee lost the greatest part of his men fighting
resolutely, for that he was suddainly inuested by many fregats and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerd
Vessels. It was hardly in his power to saue his ship, being woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in three places: for that hee had aduentured himselfe too boldly:
But <hi>Philostrates</hi> came to succour him, vndertaking the apparent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
with great courage. But when hee was ioyned vnto these Vessels,
he rechargeth the Enemy furiously againe: where he was seene weake
of body by reason of his wounds, but much more excellent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:16537:231"/>
in courage then before. It happened that there were two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats
at Sea very farre one from another: For <hi>Philips</hi> right Wing coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
still along the shore, neuer abandoned the Coast of <hi>Asia,</hi> but the
left Wing succouring the Reare-ward, had fought with the <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diens,</hi>
for that they were not farre from <hi>Chios.</hi> When as <hi>Attalus</hi>
seemed to haue gloriously Vanquished <hi>Philips</hi> right Wing, and that
hee approached neere vnto the Iland, where he Anchored, expecting
the end and conclusion of the Battaile, he perceiued one of his Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queremes
in danger to be sunke by a shippe of the Enemles, and made
hast to succour it with two other of his Quinqueremes. When as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
shippes turned away to recouer Land, the more hee prest
desiring to take it. The which <hi>Philip</hi> perceiuing, that <hi>Attalus</hi> stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
too boldly and aduenturously from his Company, hee made hast
being accompanied with foure Quinqueremes, three Gall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the neerest Frigats, hoping hee should be able to take it, as it fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
happened; forcing him to get vnto the neerest shore in great
distresse. Then leauing his Vessell there, hee fled on foote with the
Sea men, to saue himselfe in <hi>Erythee.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

               <p>They which were with <hi>Attalus</hi> in this great danger, bethought
themselues of a pollicy in Warre, and set the richest of the Kings plate
vpon the Hatches.<note place="margin">The Pollicy of <hi>Attalus</hi> his Souldiers.</note> Wherefore the first of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

and proud through <hi>Attalus</hi> mis-fortune, making great haste
to come vnto his Company. Where after he had drawne and gathered
together all his Vessells, he perswaded them to be of good Courage
and Resolution, seeing hee had wonne the Battaile. And in trueth,
such was the opinion of men, as if <hi>Attalus</hi> had beene dead in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> attributed the Victory vnto himselfe for two principall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:<note place="margin">The <hi>causes why Philip</hi> challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the Victory to himselfe.</note>
First for that hee had forced <hi>Attalus</hi> to flye to Land, and had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the royall Vessell: the other for that hee anchored in the place
which they call <hi>Argennon,</hi> among the Enemies, wrackes, and that
the next Day hee carryed himselfe as a Conquerour, gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Reliques of the fight, and drawing together the Bodies of
such as might be knowne, to the end hee might confirme this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But the <hi>Rhodiens</hi> with <hi>Dyonisod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rus</hi> made him soone after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
that it was not true, so as hee did not hold himselfe to haue had
the Victory: For the next day the King being busied about these
things, they set sayle against him, the one being aduertised of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and when (after they had put their ships in Front) no man
durst present himselfe, they retired to <hi>Chios.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Philip</hi> who had neuer before at one time lost so many men,
nor such, carryed his misfortune impatiently, and was in a manner
desperate, although hee laboured by all meanes to hide his conceite,
matters seeming vnsupportable: for besides many other occasions, the
misfortunes which happened after the Battaile, had put all those that
were present in feare. Beleeue mee, that after so great a slaughter of
men, all the Countrey where the Combate was fought, was full of
Carkases, blood, Armes, and the wrackes of Ships. And the daies
following you might haue seene the shoare full of all these things
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eaped together. So as it was not onely displeasing vnto him, but to
all the <hi>Macedonians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In regard of <hi>Theophiliscus,</hi> hauing suruiued a day, and written into
the Countrey of the successe of the Combate at Sea, and had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Cleoneus</hi> to command the Army in his place, hee dyed of the
wounds hee had receiued:<note place="margin">The death of <hi>Theophiliscus.</hi>
                  </note> who had shewed himselfe a valiant man
in danger, and who by the prouidence of his Councell, was worthy
to haue his Name preserued in memory. For if hee had not giuen
aduice to follow <hi>Philip,</hi> all the rest had neglected the opportunity of
the Victory, being amazed at his courage: so as in beginning of the
fight hee forced his Citizens to follow the occasions of the time.
Hee likewise perswaded <hi>Attalus</hi> not to temporize, nor to waste time
in the preparation of things concerning the Warre: But contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to fight valiantly, and to vndergoe the present danger. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Rhodiens</hi> haue with good reason, after his death done him
such honours, as the liuing and those that were present were not onely
incited to fight valiantly for their Countrey, but also the posterity.</p>
               <p>What doe wee then see in this violence? No other thing but
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:16537:232"/>
Nature. It oftentimes falls out that many vpon a bare shew of hope,
desire impossible things, vanquishing euery mans hope with their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse:
and when they haue once begun, they cannot diuert their
fancies: for that they haue their vnderstanding blinded and deceiued
with the impossibility of their attempts, and the discontent of the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.

some places with the whole Countrey.</p>
               <p>Being gone from thence, he planted his Campe about <hi>Prinasse,</hi>

besieged it by myning. Where when he lost his time, for that the place
was stony, he vsed this inuention: hee causeth a great noise to be made
by day in the Mynes, as if he laboured to ouerthrow the Walls, causing
in the night great store of earth to be brought and to be laid at the entry
of the Mynes, to the end he might terrifie the Inhabitants by a view
of so great a digging in the ground. It is true that at the first the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseins</hi>
were constant and couragious: but when as <hi>Philip</hi> had signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

<pb n="452" facs="tcp:16537:233"/>
without consideration comprehend not onely idle and sottish things,
but those which are impossible. For if any one should say that some

this would shew a transported Iudgement, as <hi>Theopompus</hi> hath
done, saying that they which enter into the Temple of <hi>Iupiter</hi> in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia,</hi>
make no shadow. Whereunto that is conformable which is now
spoken. Wherefore wee must pardon some Historiographers in all
things which preserue the deuotion of the people towards the Gods,
who relate monstrous things, but in that which exceeds this course,
they are not to be pardoned. Peraduenture in euery thing there is a
different quality to describe them, yea, sometimes impossible: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must pardon if any one through ignorance doth stray a little

greatnesse of the preparation, nor for the diuersity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions,
which are declared in the same worke, by the
which the besiegers and besieged doe vsually practise and surprize one
another by policies: But for the good directions and vallour of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged,
it is worthy of memory, if euer any were, and which ought to
come vnto posterity. In the beginning the Inhabitants of <hi>Abydos</hi> rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to the end they might willingly become Companions in the Combat:
And consequently drawe all their Wiues into <hi>Diana's</hi> Temple: and
the Children with their Nurses into the Schooles, and finally their
Gold and Siluer into the Market place, and the richest apparrell into

               </p>
               <p>When they had decreed these things, and had with one accord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
the resolution, they make another assembly, choosing fifty
of the most ancient, and men of credite, being strong and able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
the decree, and make them sweare in the presence of all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,
that if they saw the Wall taken by the Enemy, they should
then kill their Wiues and Children, and set fire of the sayd Galleyes,
casting (according to their Oath) the Gold and Siluer into the
Sea. Finally, they call their Prelates, who coniure them all to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish
their Enemies, or to dye fighting for their Countrey. This
done, after they had sacrificed, they force their Prelates, and their
Wiues to make execrations vpon the Sacrifices of the said things.
These things thus confirmed, they did not countermine aginst the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
Mynes, resoluing that if the Wall sell, they would stand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ruines, fighting to the death. Wherefore some one may with

hath beene vanquished by the courage of the <hi>Abydeins.</hi> The

such great courage, as when as <hi>Philip</hi> had sent supplies vnto the

no meanes to vse them, they cast themselues with fury vpon the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians,</hi>
ouerthrowing some with their armes, charging others alwaies

for the Cities and people, <hi>Aristenetes</hi> and <hi>Xenophon</hi> were for the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheins:</hi>

for the <hi>Etoliens</hi> came <hi>Phenee</hi> Chiefe of the Army, with many other
Citizens.</p>
            <p>When they were approacht the Sea neare vnto <hi>Nicea, Titus</hi> the
Chiefe of the <hi>Romans,</hi> stayed at the shoare. <hi>Philip</hi> being almost at
Land, stayed in his Vessell. And when as <hi>Titus</hi> perswaded him to Land,
he sayd (standing vpright in his ship) that hee would not. Being like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
demanded by <hi>Titus</hi> what he feared, he answered, No man but
the Gods:<note place="margin">The wise an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere of <hi>Philip.</hi>
               </note> but there were many there whom hee did not trust, namely,
the <hi>Etoliens.</hi> And when the <hi>Roman</hi> Commander wondred, saying,
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:16537:237"/>
that the perill was equall vnto all, and that time common. <hi>Philip</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
sayd, that he vnderstood it not so: For an inconuenience hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to <hi>Phenee,</hi> the <hi>Etoliens</hi> had Commaunders enough for the War:
But if <hi>Philip</hi> dyed, there was no King of <hi>Macedony</hi> for the present.
In the beginning of his Speech he seemed importune to them all. But
<hi>Tytus</hi> aduised him to speake of the Affaires for which hee was come.
<hi>Philip</hi> answered him, that it belonged to him and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ot vnto himselfe:
For this cause hee required him to let him know what there was to be
done to enioy a Peace.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Commaunder told him that hee must vse plaine and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen

and Fugitiues which were in his power: To yeild likewise vnto the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
the places of <hi>Sclauonia,</hi> which he had seazed on after the Accord
made in <hi>Epirus:</hi> That he should restore vnto <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> all the Cities
which he had taken since the Death of <hi>Ptolomeus Philopater.</hi> When
<hi>Tytus</hi> had spoken this, he held his peace: But turning to the rest, hee

After these the <hi>Etoliens</hi> required first as the <hi>Romans</hi> had done, that hee
should abandon all <hi>Greece,</hi> and that afterwards hee should restore the
Cities whole and entire, which formerly had beene of the same Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesse
with the <hi>Etoliens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When as <hi>Phenee</hi> Chiefe of the <hi>Etoliens</hi> had spoken thus, <hi>Alexander</hi>
following after, whom they call <hi>Isie,</hi> in shew a man of iudgement to
mannage affaires, and of great Eloquence,<note place="margin">Alexander <hi>against</hi> Philip.</note> said, that <hi>Philip</hi> did not
demand a peace roundly, nor made Warre valiantly, if it were to be
done at any time: and that in assemblies and treaties hee watcht care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
playing the part of an Enemy: and that in the Warre hee carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himselfe wickedly, and not as a good man. For when he should affront
the Enemy, it is manifest that hee flies the list, and in the meane time
burnes and ruines Cities: and being thus vanquished by his will, hee
corrupts the rewards of the Victors: although the ancient Kings of
<hi>Macedony</hi> were neuer of that minde, but quite contrary. They haue
fought often Battailes in the open field, and haue seldome ruined any
Cities. The which is manifest to all the World, as well by the <hi>Asian</hi>
Warre of <hi>Alexander</hi> against <hi>Darius,</hi> as by the difference of the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
by the which they haue all made Warre against <hi>Antigonus</hi> for the
Empire of <hi>Asia.</hi> And their posterity hath beene of this humour vntill
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:16537:237"/>
the time of <hi>

                  </gap>yrrhus,</hi> to fight valiantly with an Enemy in open Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile:
Doing all that concerned a mutuall Combate of men furnished
with Armes, yet pardoning the Citties: for that the Victors of them
are vanquished, and blamed by those which are subdued. It is the
part of a mad man to ruine that for which the Warre is made, and
then to leaue it: The which he sayd <hi>Philip</hi> did at that time, and that he
had ruined more Cities in <hi>Thessaly,</hi> being of the same friendship and
League in Warre; when as hee parted speedily from the streights of
<hi>Epirus,</hi> then euer any of those had done which made Warre against
the <hi>Thessaliens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when he had vsed a long Speech, and deliuered other things
of the same subiect. In the end hee demaunded of <hi>Philip,</hi> why <hi>Lysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machia</hi>
being associated to the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> and hauing a Commaunder of
the Warre from them, hee had chased him away, putting a garrison
into the Citty? Why hee had spoiled the <hi>Cyaneins,</hi> of the <hi>Etolien</hi>
Burgeoiship, being a friend to the <hi>Etoliens?</hi> Moreouer vpon what
colour he detained <hi>Escheins, Thebes, Phthie, Pharsalia,</hi> and <hi>Larrisse?</hi>
Hauing spoken this, <hi>Alexander</hi> held his peace. When as <hi>Philip</hi> had
approached neerer to Land then before, standing vpright in his ship,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Philips</hi> answer.</note>
sayd, that <hi>Alexanders</hi> Speech was <hi>Etolique:</hi> and that it was notorious
to all the World, that no man ruined those which were his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in Armes, and yet a Prince according to the occasion of times, is
many times forced to do things against his will. The King vsing this
Speech: <hi>Phenee</hi> hauing a bad sight, lookes oftentimes crosse vpon
<hi>Philip,</hi> saying that he told Fables: and that he should eyther vanquish
in fighting, or else subscribe and obey the commaundements of the
Victors.</p>
            <p>And although that <hi>Philip</hi> were discontented, yet hee omitted not
his kinde of speech; but turning to <hi>Phenee,</hi> a blind man sayd he, would
see it. He was in truth apt to Choller, and it was it a manner bred in
him, to iest at the good Fortune of other men. Then turning towards
<hi>Alexander,</hi> thou demaundest of me, sayd he, for what reason I haue
taken <hi>Lysimachia:</hi> To the end that thorough your negligence and base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
it might not be ruined by the <hi>Thrasiens,</hi> as then it happened,
hauing retired my Souldiers for the present, being there for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
thereof, and not as thou sayst to take it. In regard of the <hi>Cya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neins,</hi>
I made no Warreagainst them: But when as <hi>Prusias</hi> assailed
them in giuing him succours, I tooke the Citie with him, whereof you
haue beene the cause. For when as the other Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> and my
selfe had required you often by Embassies, to abrogate the Law
which allowes you to take spoile vpon spoile: You answered that wee
must first take <hi>Etolia</hi> from <hi>Etolia,</hi> then the sayd Law.<note place="margin">A strange Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the <hi>Etoliens.</hi>
               </note> And when as
<hi>Tytus</hi> wondred how that could be, the King laboured to make him
vnderstand it, saying that the <hi>Etoliens</hi> had a Custome not onely to
assaile those and their Country, with whom they had Warre: But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
it is lawfull for them, if their Allies be in Quarrell, to assaile both
the one and the other with their Regions, and to hold them, without
any common decree. And by this meanes the <hi>Etoliens</hi> haue neither
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:16537:238"/>
Lawes of Friendship nor Hatred, being ready to fall vpon those which
are in controuersie for any Affaires. Whereon then doe these men
ground an accusation against me? I was a friend to the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> so was
I allied to <hi>Prusias,</hi> and I attempted against the <hi>Cy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>neins</hi> to succour my
Allies.</p>
            <p>But behold a case of wonderfull discretion, that they which haue
made themselues Enemies to the <hi>Romans,</hi> commaund the <hi>Macedonians</hi>
to depart out of <hi>Greece.</hi> Without doubt it is a very arrogant Speech.
If the <hi>Romans</hi> speake it, it is tollerable, if the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> intollerable.
But out of what <hi>Greece</hi> would you haue me depart? How do you limit
it? Are there not many <hi>Etoliens</hi> in <hi>Greece?</hi> You shall see that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graeins,
Apodates,</hi> and <hi>Amphiloqueins</hi> are not of <hi>Greece,</hi> at the least
you leaue them to me. And when as <hi>Tytus</hi> smiled, this sayd he, shall
suffice against the <hi>Etoliens:</hi> And as for that which concernes the <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diens</hi>
and <hi>Attalus,</hi> we may with more iustice and equity require, that
they should rather restore to vs our Prisoners and Vessells, then we to
them. We haue not assailed the <hi>Rhodiens</hi> nor <hi>Attalus</hi> first, but they
vs, it is without contradiction. Yet for thy sake we will restore <hi>Perea</hi>
to the <hi>Rhodiens,</hi> and to <hi>Attalus</hi> his shippes and men which are liuing.
In regard of the ruine of the Triumph of Victories, and of <hi>Venus</hi>
Temple, we cannot repaire them: And for that which concernes the
Trees and Gardens, I will send men to digge the ground, and will
giue order that the Trees which are cut may grow againe. And when
as <hi>Tytus</hi> smiled againe at the scoffe of <hi>Philip, Philip</hi> addressing himselfe
to the <hi>Acheins,</hi> hee put them in minde at the first of the benefits and
fauours they had receiued from <hi>Antigonus</hi> and himselfe. Moreouer he
laid open the many Honors which the <hi>Acheins</hi> had done vnto them.
Finally, he hath read the Resolution of their reuolte in following the
<hi>Romans</hi> party. Vpon which occasion hee propounded many things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the preuarication and ingratitude of the <hi>Acheins:</hi> Yet promising
to restore them <hi>Argos.</hi> In regard of <hi>Corinthe</hi> hee would conferre
with <hi>Tytus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this Speech held to the rest, he sayd to <hi>Tytus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that hee was
to speake to him and to the <hi>Romans,</hi> whether he were of opinion that
he should abandon the Cities and places which he had Conquered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Grecians,</hi> or else those which he had receiued from his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors.
And when as <hi>Tytus</hi> held his peace, <hi>Aristenes</hi> was suddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ready to answere for the <hi>Acheins,</hi> and <hi>Phenee</hi> for the <hi>Etoliens.</hi> But
when the houre was past, the Time had closed vp their mouthes.
<hi>Philip</hi> required that hee might haue men giuen him to write downe all
that was to do for the peace. For when he was alone, he sayd he had
no man with whom conferring, he might yeild a reason of the Actions
wherewith they charged him.</p>
            <p>And although that <hi>Tytus</hi> heard <hi>Philip</hi> willingly in his iest, yet being
loath to be discouered by others, he gaue him a touch, saying: It is no
wonder if thou beest alone <hi>Philip,</hi> when thou hast slaine all those
which gaue thee Councell. The <hi>Macedonian</hi> vsing a Counterfeite
smile, held his peace. Then they all gaue in Writing what they had
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:16537:238"/>
demanded, appointing another assembly for the day following at
<hi>Nicea.</hi> To which place <hi>Titus</hi> came with his Company, where all
the rest appeared, but <hi>Philip</hi> came not. And when as the day
was farre spent, and that <hi>Titus</hi> expected his comming no longer, he
armed at Sunne setting, accompanied with the same men, saying that
he had spent the whole day in vexation and discontent, for the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the things wherewith they charg'd him, But according to the
opinion of others he did it to frustrate by the shortnesse of time, the
accusation of the <hi>Acheins</hi> and <hi>Etoliens.</hi> He had seene them the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
at his departure ready for their defence, and to complayne of
him.</p>
            <p>Wherefore at his ariuall he intreated the Commander of the <hi>Romans</hi>
to treat of this businesse with him in priuate, to the end that in debating
it, they might not fall to any outragious words, but draw it to some end.
When he had often intreated this, <hi>Titus</hi> demanded of the Assistants
their opinion what he should doe: and when they all yeelded vnto it,
and that he should obserue his words, hee tooke <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> a
Captaine of a thousand, and commanding the rest that retiring a little
into the Sea, they should stay there, bidding <hi>Philip</hi> to come to Land.
The King accompanied with <hi>Apolodorus</hi> and <hi>Demosthenes</hi> landed,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Philip</hi> lands.</note> and
had a long discourse with <hi>Titus.</hi> In regard of that which was spoken
of eyther side,<note place="margin">The Articles agreed on by <hi>Philip.</hi>
               </note> it is a difficult thing to iudge. <hi>Titus</hi> then when as
<hi>Philip</hi> was retired, related vnto the rest the things which hee had
propounded, namely that he would yeelde vnto the <hi>Etoliens, Larissa</hi>
and <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> but not <hi>Thebes:</hi> That to the <hi>Rhodiens</hi> hee would leaue
<hi>Perea,</hi> but not <hi>Iasson</hi> nor <hi>Bargulies</hi> to the <hi>Acheins Corinthe,</hi> and the
City of <hi>Argiues:</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> that which hee held in <hi>Sclauonia</hi> with
all the prisoners. That he would restore to <hi>Attalus</hi> the vessels, and
all the prisoners that were liuing since the nauall fight. But when as
the whole Company disliked of this accord, saying that they must
generally decree that he must depart out of all <hi>Greece:</hi> Otherwise all
these articles would be vaine and friuolous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philip</hi> seeing this contention, fearing likewise the future accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he intreats <hi>Titus</hi> to deferre this assembly vntill the next day, for
that it is now late, saying that hee would perswade them, or suffer
himselfe to be perswaded. And when as <hi>Titus</hi> had granted this, they
resolued to assemble againe at the Port of <hi>Tyronye,</hi> and so they
parted. The day following they all mette at the houre appoynted.
<hi>Philip</hi> hauing made a short speech,<note place="margin">Another assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Thronye.</hi>
               </note> requires them all, especially <hi>Titus,</hi>
that they would not breake of the treaty of peace: for that there were
many things which did conduct to the conclusion of an accord, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
the fault were in them, that the composition was not made.
Otherwise they must send Embassadours to the Senate to order their
differences, to the which he would obey, and doe all they should
command him.</p>
            <p>These things thus propounded by <hi>Philip,</hi> the others said that they
must doe that which concerned the warre, and not trust to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands:
But the <hi>Roman</hi> Commander said, that hee was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:16537:239"/>
that <hi>Philip</hi> would not doe any thing that was propounded vnto
him: and yet their cause was nothing impaired, in yeelding him this
fauour which hee demanded. For there could nothing be spoken there
that could be confirmed without the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate: and that moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the approaching time would be very commodious to make tryall of
their aduice. For as the Armies are vnprofitable in regard of the
Winter, there could be no inconuenience, if in the meane time
they referr'd themselues vnto the Senate, but a great commodity vnto
them all.</p>
            <p>When they were of this opinion seeing <hi>Titus</hi> to concurre, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
differences should be transferrd'd to the Senate,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Philips</hi> cause sent to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> they resolued to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<hi>Philip</hi> to send an Embassie to <hi>Rome,</hi> and in like manner all in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
to make their causes knowne vnto the Senate, and to accuse <hi>Philip.</hi>
When this resolution of the Assembly had succeeded according to the
humour and aduice of <hi>Titus</hi> conceiued in the beginning, he presently
pursued those things which were requisite for the Enterprize, hauing
giuen order for his affaires. Finally, hee deales no more with <hi>Philip,</hi>
but assignes him two Moneths onely, in the which hee should send an
Embassie to <hi>Rome,</hi> and should retire his Garrisons for <hi>Phocis</hi> and <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre.</hi>
Hee giues him likewise charge, that hee should not make Warre
against any of the <hi>Roman</hi> Allies, and should giue order that in the
meane time the <hi>Macedonians</hi> should doe them no outrage.</p>
            <p>And when he had dealt with <hi>Philip</hi> vpon these Articles by Writing,
he brought the rest of the things propounded to an end of himselfe.
Hee suddainly sends <hi>Aminandre</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> knowing his sufficiency in
affaires, and to purchase Friends easily wheresoeuer hee came: and
that he would procure some good conceite and hope, in regard of the

said, that hee would leaue the other places, it is a fancy and a shift to
escape the present time: and when opportunity should serue, hee
would easily subdue the <hi>Grecians,</hi> so as hee held the said places. For
this cause they intreated the Senate, that <hi>Philip</hi> might leaue those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
or else continue in his Enterprize, and fight valiantly: And
that the greatest part of the Warre was already decided, the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
hauing lost two Battailes, and the greatest part of their forces at

            <p>These Speeches ended, they intreated them with all affection not
to suffer the <hi>Grecians</hi> to bee frustrated of the hope of their liberty, nor
themselues depriued of an honourable Title. The Embassadors of
<hi>Greece</hi> hauing debated these things or the like: those of <hi>Philip</hi> had
prepared a Mountaine of words, but they were suddainly reiected.

was a great difference betwixt them.<note place="margin">A difference betwixt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> Stakes and the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                  </note> The <hi>Grecians</hi> held a stake that
had many branches at the foote very commodious. But the <hi>Romans</hi>
vse stakes with two, or three, or foure branches at the most, so as they
are easie to carry, for a man carries two or three Faggots together.
There is also this difference: For the <hi>Grecians</hi> stake planted before the
Campe, may be easily pull'd vp. When that onely which is strong, is
fixed in the ground, and hath many and great branches, if two or
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:16537:240"/>
three of them shew themselues, and draw the stake vnto them, it is
easily pull'd vp. And whereas this happens, there is a breach easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made, by reason of the greatnesse, and then the ioyning of them
is vndone by the shortnesse and mutuall height of this kinde of
Pallisado The <hi>Romans</hi> doe otherwise. They plant themright vp,
and interlace them in such sort, as it is not easie for any one to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
or know from which the of the stakes stucke in the ground, the
shootes take their growth, nor from what stockes the branches come.
Finally, it is not possible for him that seekes to pull them vp, to put
to his hand, for that they are very thicke and intermixt together:
And if they bee carefully planted, he that shall lay hold on them, shall
not be able to pull them vp easily, for thatall their ioynts take their
force from the Earth: Secondly, hee shall bee forced to transport
many shootes together, which shall lay hold of one branch, in regard

seaze vpon one stake. Yet if it happens that some one pulls vp one or
two, yet the space cannot be discouered. Wherefore there is a great
difference, for that this kinde of stakes is easie to finde, and easie to
carry, and the vse is more safe and firme. So as it is apparent, that
if the <hi>Ramans</hi> haue not any thing touching the mannaging of the War
which is worthy of imitation, yet this kind of stakes (at the least in
my iudgement) deserues it.</p>

to their Campes. And when as the day following the Plaine
was displeasing to either of them, for that it was full of Trees,
Hedges, and Gardens, they raise their Campes. <hi>Philip</hi> tooke his
way towards <hi>Scotusse,</hi> making haste, to the end hee might draw
Victuals from the City, and lodge his Army with more aduantage.
<hi>Titus</hi> coniecturing what would happen, parts with his Army at the

the comming of <hi>Philip.</hi> But for that in the marching of the two
Armies, there was a great interposition of high Hills and Mountaines,
the <hi>Romans</hi> nor the <hi>Macedonians</hi> could not discouer one another in
the direction of their way. Wherefore that dayes iourney being
ended, <hi>Titus</hi> came vnto <hi>Eretria,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> to the Riuer of <hi>On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiste,</hi>
and presently planted their Campes there vnknowne to

               <p>And when as the day following they had marched on, <hi>Philip</hi>
stayes at <hi>Melambie</hi> of the <hi>Seotusseins,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> about the <hi>Thetidie</hi>

And as there fell a Raine and the yearely Thunder, it happened that
the day following in the Morning there arise a great fogge, the which

making haste to dispatch that which was offred, Campt wandring

difficulty of the way in regard of the fogge, he aduanced little, and
pallisadoed his Campe.</p>
               <p>Finally, he sent <hi>Phedria,</hi> and giues him charge to gaine the tops

and being doubtfull where the Enemies were, he made choice
of tenne Bands, and about a thousand of the most valiant, sending
them before to search diligently, and to enter the Countrey: who

               <p>But when as the <hi>Romans</hi> in this Charge were prest, and in danger

Succours. <hi>Titus</hi> commanding the <hi>Etoliens,</hi> sends those which were
vnder the charge of <hi>Archidamus,</hi> and of the <hi>Eupolemus,</hi> and two
Tribunes with fiue hundred Horse, and two thousand Foote. At

fight. And although the <hi>Macedonians</hi> defended themselues braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yet they sent vnto the King, being prest and annoyed by their
Armes, and for their refuge recouered the tops of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.</p>
               <p>And when as <hi>Philip</hi> had no hope but that they should be able that
day to giue Battaile with all their Forces for the fore-sayd Causes,
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:16537:241"/>
hee had sent many of his men to forrage. But when he was aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
of that which happened by those which hee had sent, and that
the mist was past, hee sent <hi>Heraclides</hi> the <hi>Gyrtonien,</hi> Chiefe of the

               <p>Hee likewise sent <hi>Athenagórus</hi> with all the Mercenaries exept the
<hi>Thracians.</hi> Who being come to the Ambush, and the <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
much re-inforced, they made head against the Enemy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls'd
the <hi>Romans</hi> from the Hills. The Dexterity of the <hi>Etolien</hi>
Horse did much hinder the Enemies from turning head. They
fought in truth with great courage and confidence.<note place="margin">The Nature of the <hi>Etoliens</hi> as well on force as Horsebacke.</note> The <hi>Etoliens</hi> in

aboue all the other <hi>Grecians</hi> in particular and separated Combats.
Wherefore it happened, that for that they had stayed the violence
and fury of the Enemy, they could not so soone recouer the Plaine,
but stayed for a time in Battaile.</p>
               <p>But when as <hi>Titus</hi> saw not onely the most valiant and his Horse-men

stirre vp <hi>Philip</hi> to Battaile, although the scituation of the place did
not content and please him. For the sayd Hills (which they call
<hi>Dogs-head</hi>) are rough, difficult of all sides, and high. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when as <hi>Philip</hi> had formerly fore-seene the vnequalnesse of the
places, hee had not in the beginning made any preparation vnto
Battaile: But beeing then prouoked by the great confidence of the
aduertisements, hee drawes his Army with all speede out of
the Fort.</p>
               <p>In regard of <hi>Titus,</hi> hee orders his Troupes and Bands for the
Battaile, and followes them close which began the Skirmish, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
remonstrances vnto the Battalions as hee turned. His Speech
was short, plaine, and intelligible to the Hearers. Propounding
then the cause, hee sayd vnto his Souldiers: Are not these O Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
the same <hi>Macedonians,</hi> who formerly holding in <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
the top of the Mountaines towards <hi>Heordia,</hi> you haue forced
with <hi>Sulpicius,</hi> and chased from thence with the defeate of the
greatest part of them? Are not these the same <hi>Macedonians,</hi> who
being seazed vpon the difficult places of <hi>Epirus,</hi> and leauing no
hope of approach, you haue chased by your prowesse, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to flye into <hi>Macedony,</hi> abandoning their Armes? What reason
is there then that you should feare the same men, with whom you are
to enter into an equall Combate? To what end doe we propound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you precedent actions to consider on, but that in regard of
them you should fight more confidently? Wherefore Companions
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:16537:242"/>
attend the Battaile with resolution, giuing courage one to another.
I hold for certaine, that with the good pleasure of the Gods, the
end of this Battaile will soone bee the conclusion of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Titus</hi> had vsed these Speeches, hee commands the right
Wing of his Army not to budge, setting the Elephants before them:
And assailes the Enemy with great courage with the left Wing, being
accompanied by the most valiant. They which among the <hi>Romans</hi>
had began the Fight, shewing their courage, prest the Enemies, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
beene relieued by some Troupes of Foot-men. And when as
at the same time <hi>Philip</hi> saw that the greatest part of his Army was in
order of Battaile before the Pallisadoe,<note place="margin">A Battaile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedony.</hi>
                  </note> hee marcheth, taking the
Targetteers and the Battalion of the right Wing, and ascends the
Hills with speede: giuing charge to <hi>Nicanor</hi> (whom hee called E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephant)
to command the rest of the Army to follow close. As
soone as the first had recouered the top, hee defends the Battalion,
setting the Targets before, and seazed vpon the higher Countrey.
And when as the <hi>Macedonians</hi> prest the <hi>Romans</hi> much, vpon the
two flankes of the Hills, he discouered the tops to bee abandoned.
As he fortified the right Wing of his Army, it happened that the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
were much annoyed by the Enemy.</p>
               <p>For when they they which were best armed, were ioyned vnto the
most valiant of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and succoured them in this fight, they
prest the Enemies much and flew many. As the King was there
in the beginning, and saw the Combat of the valiant men not to be
farre from the Campe, hee reioyced: againe, when hee saw them
decline, and to haue neede of Succours, hee was forced to send
them, and at that instant to hazard a Battaile, although that many
of the Troupes of his Army were yet vpon the way, and approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
to the Hills. And in taking the Souldiers hee rankes them all,
as well on foote as Horsebacke on the right Wing, commanding the
beares of Burthe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Rankes, and to stand close vpon the right hand.</p>
               <p>This being done, when as the Enemies ioyned with them, hee
commanded the Battalion that bending downe their Iauelings they
should match in order, and mingle with the strongest. At the
same instant, when as <hi>Titus</hi> had retired those which had bagunne
the Fight, to the spaces which were betwixt the Ensignes, he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
the Enemy.</p>
               <p>The Combat beginning on eyther side with great fury and clamour,
all crying together, yet those which were without the fight cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vnto the rest, the Battaile was made very horrible and cruell,
and it shewed the force of the Combat, <hi>Philips</hi> right Wing car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
it selfe valiantly in this Battaile: charging the Enemy from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue,
hauing an aduantage in their order: which finally for the
present fight was much more commodions, in regard of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity
and seuerall sorts of Armes. In regard of the rest of the
Army, some were ioyned vnto the Enemy fighting a farre off, others
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:16537:242"/>
shewed themselues vpon the left hand hauing gotten the toppes of

               <p>When as <hi>Tytus</hi> saw and did well perceiue that his men could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the force of the Enemies battallion, and those of the right
wing to be repuls'd, and some seaine, and others to retire by degrees,
and that all his hope of safety consisted in the right Wing, hee goes
speedily vnto them, and considers the Enemies order. When hee
saw some succeed in their places which had fought, and others to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
from the Hils, and some to stay vpon the tops, he marcheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Enemy with his Ensignes, putting the Elephants before. And
when as the <hi>Macedonians</hi> had no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and that they could not make it good, nor receiue any true order
of a battallion, aswell for the difficulty of the place, as for that the
Combattants had the forme of goers, and not of an order of Battaile,
and that there was no further meanes to fight single, or hand to hand
with the <hi>Romans:</hi> Being also terrified and much iniured with the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants,
and likewise separated one from another, they marcht pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
away. Wherefore many <hi>Romans</hi> pursued them continually and
slew them.</p>
               <p>One of the Captaines Milleneirs being of this Troupe, hauing but
twenty Ensignes, considering at the very instant what was to be done,
did great seruice for the obtaining of an absolute Victory. For when
he saw those that accompanied <hi>Philip,</hi> assailed the others often, and
grieuously to annoy the left Wing, hee turnes to them that were in
distresse, leauing those which vanquished on the right Wing, and
charged the <hi>Macedonians</hi> in the Reare. When as they of the Battalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
could not make resistance, fighting man to man, this other was at
their backes, killing those they incountred, there beeing no man that
could succour them, so as in the end they were forced to turne head,
and to abandon their Armes. Although that <hi>Philip</hi> (as wee haue sayd
in the beginning) had a great hope in the Victory, making a coniecture
in his owne conceite, yet seeing the <hi>Macedonians</hi> to abandon and leaue
their Armes suddainly, and the Enemies to charge in the Reare, hee
parts speedily from the Battaile with some Horse and Foote to consider
fully of the Combate.</p>
               <p>When as he imagined that the <hi>Romans</hi> by their pursuite would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to the right Wing on the tops of the Hills, hee seekes to draw

When as <hi>Tytus</hi> pursued the Chase, and had discouered the left Wing
of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> to ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are accustomed to do when they yeild, or retire from the Enemy.
When hee had knowne the cause of this accident, hee restraines his

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Had promised in the sixt Booke, to make a Comparison
of the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Macedonian</hi> Armes, and of the ordring
of their Battailes, and wherein they differ eyther worse
or better: Now I will indeauour to performe my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.
As in former times the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Armies haue
giuen good proofes of their Valour, hauing Vanquished the <hi>Asiatiques</hi>
and <hi>Grecians,</hi> and that the <hi>Romans</hi> haue surmounted the <hi>Affricans</hi> as
much, as all the Westerne Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> and that in our time
the conferrence of these Armies and men is to be made, not for once
but for many times, it will be commodious and profitable to seeke
out their difference, and for what reason the <hi>Romans</hi> vanquish, hauing
alwayes the vpper hand in Martiall Combats: To the end that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
it from Fortune, wee should with reason call them happy
Victors, as the ignorant vsually do: But knowing the true cause, wee
should commend and holde these Captaines for miracnlous.
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:16537:243"/>
In regard of the Battailes giuen betwixt <hi>Hannibal</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi>
and their losse, it is not needfull to vse any long Discourse. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
without doubt did not suffer those losses, for want of Armes, and
the order of their Battailes,<note place="margin">The <hi>Romans</hi> haue bin Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished by the pollicy of <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
                  </note> but in regard of the good direction and
pollicy of <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We declared this when we related the Battailes themselues. The
end of the Warre confirmes our opinion. For when as the <hi>Romans</hi>
had found a Commaunder like vnto <hi>Hannibal,</hi> they suddainely were
Victors. So doth this, that when as <hi>Hannibal</hi> had Vanquished the
<hi>Romans</hi> first, he furnished the common Souldiers better with the
<hi>Roman</hi> Armes, reiecting their owne: Hauing vsurped them in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
he afterwards made continuall vse of them. <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> in like
manner did not onely vse the <hi>Italians</hi> Armes, but also their ordering
of Armies, when as by change he sets in the head of the <hi>Romans</hi> an
Ensigne and Band of the Battallion. Yet hee could not ouer-come
nor vanquish by this meanes, the end of the Combate beeing alwaies
doubt to the one and the other. It shalbe therefore necessary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
to Trea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e thereof first, to the end that nothing may seeme
any way contrary vnto our opinion: but I will beginne our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrence.</p>
               <p>It is an cafie thing to know by many instructions, that if a Battalion
obserues its proper order and forces, so nothing can annoy it, nor
withstand it, for as an armed man hath three foote in his posture in a
close Combate, and that the length of his Pike from one end to the
other is of foure and twenty foote, and at the least of one and twenty:
And that for the space of his hands with the end which remaines for to
shake it, they abate sixe foote during the Combate, it is apparent that
a Pike shall haue fifteene foote in length, besides the body of euery
man that is armed, when with both hands hee presents it and chargeth
the Enemy. Whereby it commonly happens that the other Pikes
passe three foote before the second, third, and fourth rancke of the
precedent: The others before the fifth, if the Battallions be fitly ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and close, according vnto the order of those which are in the
Reare and vpon the Flanckes: As <hi>Homer</hi> teacheth when hee sayth,
the Target assures the Target, the Head-peece the Head-peece, and
the Man the Man: The Head-peeces adorned with Horses haire, touch
one another with their braue Crests: tending, that they should be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
together and close.</p>
               <p>As these things are spoken with good reason and trueth, it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
necessary, that the Pikes should be charged, according to those
that go before, passing betwixt them the length of ten foot and a halfe.
By this meanes they may visibly know of what force the preparation
and order of a Battallion is, hauing the length of sixteene Ranckes:
Whereof they which exceed the fifth cannot fight with their P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>kes.
For this cause they cannot fight hand to hand, nor man to man: but
they support them at their backes vntill they take breath, to the end that
the first ranke may hold a firme order, repulsing all manner of force with
their Pikes, which (passing the first) might charge vpon the reare. For
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:16537:244"/>
in marching after this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>manner, they presse the fore-most with the
weight of their bodies, to make a more violent charge. For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for the fore-most to turne backe.</p>
               <p>This being the order of a <hi>Macedonian</hi> Battalion, aswell in particular
as in generall, wee must by way of comparison speake of the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and differences of the <hi>Roman</hi> Armes, and of their ordering of a
Battaile. The <hi>Romans</hi> haue three foote space with their Armes. The
which in fighting they mooue from man to man,<note place="margin">Order of the <hi>Romans</hi> Armes.</note> for that euery man
couers his body with his Target, the which they also vse when any
occasion of Combate is offered. They commonly fight with the
Sword by transport and apart: Wherefore it is manifest that these
men haue betwixt them, a Retreate and space of three foote at the
least, betwixt him that goes before, and the other which followes to
fight more at ease, whereby it happens that a <hi>Roman</hi> standing still,
contaynes the space of two <hi>Macedonian</hi> Souldiers, beeing in the first
Ranke: So as he must offer himselfe and fight against ten Pikes: All
which one cannot cut if hee would, holding them in his hands: Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can the following Forces any way assist the first Ranke, neyther to
assaile nor to mannage their Armes. So as wee may easily coniecture,
that it is impossible for any man liuing, to sustaine and defend the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of a <hi>Macedonian</hi> Battallion in Front,<note place="margin">For what cause the <hi>Romans</hi> Vanquish.</note> if (as wee haue formerly
sayd) it retaynes its propriety and force, for what cause then doe the
<hi>Romans</hi> Vanquish?</p>
               <p>Whence comes it that <hi>Macedonian</hi> Battallions, are frustrated of their
Hope of Victory? It is for that the <hi>Roman</hi> Ordonance, hath in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile
infinite places and times commodious for the Combate, and the
<hi>Macedonians</hi> haue onely place and time, when it may bee seruiceable
and commodious. And therefore if vpon some necessity the Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>all suddainly vpon the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Battallions, when they are
to giue Battaile, it is likely that they which make vse of it, would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
the Masters. But if they can diuert or turne it, (which is an
easie thing) of what amazement and great terrour will this Ordo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
be?</p>
               <p>Moreouer it is very playne and manifest that a <hi>Macedonian</hi> Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallion
hath neede of Plaines and Euen ground without any let or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbance,
as Ditches, Springs, Vallies, Hills, and Water-courses:
for all these things may disturbe, breake, and make frustrate their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and intention. It is (as a man may say) in manner impossible, to
finde a Countrey of twenty Furlongs (I speake of no more) where
none of the afore-mentioned things are found. It is without any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
or doubt a rare thing, and which no reasonable man will deny.
Yet I will allow there are some found. If the Enemies do not direct
and guide themselues thether, but passing on ruine the Townes, Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Cities, and whole Regions of their Friends and Allies, what
profite then will grow by this kinde of Ordonance? If it stayes in
places of aduantage, it cannot giue succours to its friends, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
it selfe. For Victuals, Munition, and succours, may bee very
easily intercepted by an Enemy, if without any opposition hee
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:16537:244"/>
be master of the field. If likewise in leauing places of aduantage, a
<hi>Macedonian</hi> Battalion seekes to execute some enterprize, hee is in
danger of the Enemy. For although that some one goes to field,
and doth not at one time offer his Army to the fury of the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
Battalion, diuerting himselfe for a time during the fight, wee
may easily coniecture by that which the <hi>Romans</hi> doe at this day, what
will happen. The coniecture of that which wee say, must not bee
taken from the effect. They doe not present their Battalion in such
an indifferent place, as they must suddenly fight with all their forces
in front. One part fights the other stirres not.</p>
               <p>Moreouer if at any time the <hi>Macedonians</hi> presse their Enemies ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly,
and are afterward repuls'd by them, the proper order of
the Battalion is broken. For they leaue the rest of the Army, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they pursue those that are retired, or flye from those which
charge them. The which being done, they leaue vnto the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
the place which they had held, not to charge in front, but
to serue them vpon the flancke or in the reare, to succour those
of the Battalion. Why it is not probable, that it should bee ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
for a <hi>Roman</hi> Battalion, to obserue time and aduantage, and
not for a <hi>Macedonian,</hi> seeing the differences are great, according
to the truth of the said things.</p>
               <p>Moreouer it is necessary for those which make vse of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonian</hi>
Ordonance, to passe through all sorts of Countries, and
to plant their Campe, and finally to seaze vpon commodious places
and to besieged and indure sieges, and to present himselfe against
the Enemy. All these things are requirest in warre: Sometimes also
the generall moments which are great, serue much for the victory:
all which are not easie for a <hi>Macedonian</hi> Ordonance, yea sometimes
they are vnprofitable, for that the souldier can neyther serue in rancke
nor man to man: Whereas the <hi>Roman</hi> is fit and profitable for these
things. For euery <hi>Roman</hi> comming to fight with his Armes, is
actiue for all times and places and for all charges: and hath generally
one Ordonance, whither he be to fight in Troupe with the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
or particularly Ensigne, to Ensigne or Man to Man. Wherefore
as the commodity is most excellent, so many times the end and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of the Battaile is more prosperous and successefull vnto the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
then to others. I haue therefore thought it necessary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
to vse a long Discourse concerning these things, for that
there are many <hi>Grecians</hi> at this day which hold it incredible, that the
<hi>Macedonians</hi> should be vanquished and ouercome, being ignorant of
the cause and meanes, whereby a <hi>Macedonian</hi> Ordonance is vanquished
by the <hi>Roman</hi> Armes.</p>
               <p>When as <hi>Philip</hi> had vsed all possible meanes hee could in this

made great hast (passing by <hi>Tempe</hi>) to recouer <hi>Macedony,</hi> beeing
accompanied with all those which had escaped from the Battaile.
Hee presently sent vnto <hi>Laressa</hi> the second Night after the Battaile,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:16537:245"/>
one of the Archers of his Guard, giuing him charge to teare and
burne the Royall Letters, doing therein an Act worthy of a King,
who in his aduerse Fortune had not forgotten that which was to bee
done. He knew and did well perceiue that if the <hi>Romans</hi> were once
seazed on his Commentaries, there might be many occasions offered
vnto his Enemies against him and his Friends. It may bee it happened
and fell out to him as to others, who not able to containe their power
moderately in prosperous things, yet haue borne and suffered many
Crosses and Disasters with patience: The which happened vnto <hi>Philip,</hi>
as wilbe apparent by the following Discourse. So as ayming at that
which was conuenient, wee haue plainly shewed and declared his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
tending to reason, and againe his change to worse, and when,
how, and wherefore these things were done, hauing plainely set
foorth and exprest his Actions: Wee must by the same meanes
declare his Repentance and dilligence, whereby beeing changed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough

time like a wise and discreete man. Finally, <hi>Tytus</hi> hauing giuen good

<hi>Philip:</hi> He likewise aduised him not to meddle with the free Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

into <hi>Europe</hi> with an Army as well by Sea as Land: That no man could

for any other then for the <hi>Romans.</hi> Finally, hee intreated them not to

would not meddle with any thing that was in <hi>Italy.</hi> In regard of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
he had entred with his Armies to recouer the Cities of <hi>Cherrone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se</hi>

when as <hi>Seleucus</hi> made Warre against him, and had ouerthrowne him
in Battaile, all the Kingdome of <hi>Lysimachus</hi> became subiect to <hi>Seleucus</hi>
by force. After the time of his predecessors, <hi>Ptolomy</hi> was the first who
violently the sayd places, vsurped them: The like did <hi>Philip.</hi> And
that for his part he recouered them, accommodating himselfe to his

But casting his lookes vpon <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> he was long in that estate, as it
were threatning him, and wondring at his presumption. But when
as <hi>Ptolomy</hi> approacht with assurance, and layd hold of his Cloake, then
he required helpe of the Assistants. Being in this estate, and a great
company of the young men comming about him, being also aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that his house was enuironed with Souldiers, hee followed him
obeying the times, being accompanied by his Friends. When as hee
was come to the Assembly and Councell, the King charged him a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle:
Then <hi>Policrates</hi> newly arriued from <hi>Cypres:</hi> and in the end <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes.</hi>
The accusation was according to that which had beene spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
but they added moreouer, that he had drawne his Friends toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to consult, and that being called by the King, he would not obey.
For which things all they which were in the Assembly, not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
him, but likewise the forreine Embassadors there assisting. But
when as <hi>Aristomenes</hi> came to accuse him, he tooke many notable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
not onely of <hi>Greece,</hi> but also of the <hi>Etolien</hi> Embassadors, who
were there for the accord: Among the which was <hi>Dorimachus,</hi> the
Sonne of <hi>Nicostrates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when as these men had spoken, <hi>Scope</hi> laboured to alledge some
excuses: But when as no man giue eare vnto him for the foulenesse of his
Crimes, hee was suddainly carryed to Prison with his Friends. The
Night following, <hi>Aristomenes</hi> caused him to dye of poyson with all

of <hi>Hellespont,</hi> had made him Commander of all his Army at Sea, and
superintendant of the sayd businesse. And when he was sent to a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest

cruelty, and the other to iniquity: Vpon the which he sacrificed and
prayed as vnto the Gods. Wherefore it seemes hee was punished by
a iust Death, as well in the presence of Gods as Men. For as he led a
life of a strange Nature, so he ended by a strange Death. Finally, when
as the other <hi>Etoliens</hi> were desirous to retire home, the King suffred
them to goe with all their Goods. <hi>Scope</hi> in his life time had a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
desire of riches. Hee exceeded all other in auarice. And after his
death his houses were found abounding with Gold and rich moueables.
Whereas he had for assistant the ingratitude and drunkennesse of <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morthe,</hi>
he had wholy corrupted the Realme.</p>
               <p>When as the Priuy Councell had taken order for the <hi>Etoliens</hi> affaires,
they all inclined to giue power to the King to command: Not in regard
of the maturity of his age, but for that they thought thereby, that the
estate of the Crowne would further the affaires: and that if the King
tooke vpon him a free power of the Realme, it would be a beginning

and aduancement to the better. Making then a stately preparation,
they put it in execution with royall Magnificence. <hi>Policrates</hi> seemed
to haue assisted them much in this Enterprize. For as this man was
deare vnto his Father, being yet young, there was not a better Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

as <hi>Cypres</hi> with the reuenewes were deliuered vnto him vpon his faith
and trust, in that dangerous time subiect to many hazards, he not only
kept this Iland for the Infant, but also gathered together great store
of Treasure, the which he then brought vnto the King, deliuering the
gouernment of <hi>Cypres</hi> to <hi>Ptolomy</hi> the <hi>Megalopolitaine.</hi> And when vpon
this occasion, he had purchased a great power for the future, in time
he strayed and fell into a rash and wicked course of life. <hi>Ptolomy Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandre</hi>
by the force of his Age fell into the like infamy. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

their gouernments.</p>
