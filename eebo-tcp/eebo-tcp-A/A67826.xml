            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Psal. 52. 7.</bibl>
               <q>Lo this is the man that took not God for his
strength, but trusted unto the multitude of his
riches, and strengthened himself in his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is an Observation as true as common, that
no man was ever extremely wicked upon a
sudden; a hardy sinner must be a work of time,
a Creature of industry and toil, of conflicts
and repulses: And that because Nature, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
depraved, has yet left such strong guards
upon Vertue, that no man can break through
them without doing violence not onely to his
Reason, but his very Complexion too. It is
no easie thing to overcome the shame that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107262:3"/>
attends all dishonest actions, and makes
those that commit them to love darkness. It
is no easie thing to overcome the fear that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
haunts the guilty conscience, and makes
darkness it self to be no security: much less is
it easie to dare to live at enmity with God, after
conviction that he is all-knowing, and just, and
his wrath a consuming fire. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all this, since wofull experience puts
it out of question that men do daily arrive at
this desperate pitch; that how dangerous soever
the precipice be, thither they venture; and
being there, bear their danger with less concern
then others can behold it: It may be worth our
while to enquire how, and by what degrees sin
thus advances; and as it advances, infatuates.
The scheme is laid down in my Text; where,
in the person of <hi>Doeg,</hi> we have the description
of a sinner Consummate; one that had fill'd up
his measure, and was now ripe and overtaken
with judgment. For the first words of the verse,
<hi>Lo this is the man,</hi> point out his miserable end,
which the Context will tell us, was <hi>destruction
and casting out of the Land of the living.</hi> And
the rest of the words (on which I design chiefly
to insist.) are his character, exhibiting the
wicked course of life which brought him to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107262:3"/>
that miserable end, <hi>(viz.) He took not
God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Character consists of three Members,
which are as it were the three Stations of the
Broad way; The first being Alienation from
God, the second Application to the World, the
third Impiety profest: and these three are
Consequential to each other, as well in the
order of Nature, as of the Text.</p>
            <p>I beg in with the first member of the Character,
<hi>He took not God for his strength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The order and importance of this default, will
best appear if we inquire into the true measures
of humane nature; and see what strength she has
in her self, and what she wants; and thence
deduce the necessity of our dependance upon
God.</p>
            <p>From those that have searched into the state
of humane nature, we have sometimes received
very different and incompatible accounts; as
though the Inquirers had not been so much
learning, as fashioning the subject they had in
hand; and that as arbitrarily as a Heathen Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
that could make either a God or a Tressel
out of the same piece of wood. For some have
cry'd down Nature into such a desperate impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
as would render the Grace of God ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107262:4"/>
and others, on the contrary, have inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
her with such power and self-sufficiency,
as would render the Grace of God superfluous.
The first of these Opinions wrongs Nature in
defect by allowing her no strength, which in
consequence most make men desperate: The
second wrongs Nature in excess by imputing
too much strength, which in effect must make
men confident: And both of them do equally
destroy the Reason of our application to God
for strength. For neither will the man that is
well in conceit, nor yet the desperate, apply
himself to a Physician; because the one cries
there is no need, the other, there is no help.
I presume therefore that a more distinct view of
these two extreme opinions, may properly serve
to guide us into the notice of the true
state of Nature, which lies between them
both.</p>
            <p>As for the first Opinion, which wrongs
Nature in Defect, it was hatcht in the Heathen
Schools upon this occasion. The Philosophers
having considered the reproachfull nature of
sin, how that in it self it was nothing but injury,
turpitude, and folly; and in its effects, mischief,
inquietude, and ill-boding fears: concluded
justly that the commission of it was base and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107262:4"/>
and that the deliberate choice of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
action was a greater reproach to reason,
then reason was an ornament to man: But ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
finding themselves dipt in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
guilt, and too soft to resist the pleasing
evil, but likewise too proud to own the reproach
of it; They set their wits on work to contrive
an expedient, how a man might sin, and yet
not be in the fault, and so be able to keep his
Crimes and Credit too. The expedient they
contrived was this, to maintain, That sin was
no voluntary Act, but a meer forced one: and
this they proved by two Mediums, Fate and
Matter; as each of them introducing a necessity
upon humane actions. From the first they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued,
that all humane actions were pre-deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by the irresistible Power of an Eternal
Decree, so that Man did not purely act any
thing of himself, but was a meer passive Tool in
the hand of Destiny. From the second they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued,
That though man were allowed liberty of
Acting, yet he could have no liberty of Choice,
because his Choice was always determined to
the worser side by a certain insuperable maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in matter; that is, by the pravity of his consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.
Upon either of these accounts it follow'd
that man was a meer impotent slave, always
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107262:5"/>
overruled by force, either from without or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
and therefore since he could not possibly help
what he did, why should he be blamed for it? ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
let the causes be blamed to which he owed
his necessity. Thus did the Philosophers endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to bring mankind off from the scandal of
their faults by impeaching Nature; as an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Jury will bring off a murtherer by a <hi>Non
Compos mentis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to their Hypothesis of the Irresistible Decree
I shall speak no more of it but this, that they who
first broacht it, and therefore were most fond
of it, found it clogg'd with so many ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
so reflecting upon the Deity, and of
such ill influence upon Manners, that though they
were accounted the most pertinacious sect of
men in the world, they have left it honestly retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
<hi>Chrysippus</hi> disavows it in <hi>Cicero</hi> &amp; <hi>Gellius;</hi>
&amp; the more Modern Stoicks build all their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
upon a clear contrary foundation: for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>
is their first Principle: that
is, all men's internal actions are naturally free.</p>
            <p>As for the Malignity of Matter, it was a
Notion more tolerable among the Heathens,
because their errours about the Eternity and
Original Qualities of Matter were perhaps
Invincible: but for Christians to impute the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107262:5"/>
same effects to the Corruption of our Nature by
the Fall, as though we had thereby contracted
such a Complexional Necessity of sinning, as
neither precept nor caution, nor all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
that God has provided; could rescue us
from that Necessity: This is a great Calumny
to Nature, and affront to God's goodness, and
a meer crude apology of such as were first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
for a lazy indulgence to Vice. And yet
this pretence is not unusual; it is not unusual
to hear men confess their sins in such a subtle
form, as though they were drawing schemes of
Sophistry against the day of Judgement.  <q> I must
not deny my sins, (says the Man) the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
man falls seven times a day; We dwell
in a body of sin; Our first Parent eat of the
forbidden fruit, and so derived a Curse
upon his unhappy posterity; <hi>Homo sum,</hi> I
am a son of <hi>Adam,</hi> I need say no more to
speak my guilt.</q> And now what means such
a Confession as this, but that the Man is willing
to discharge the burthen of his Conscience upon
something out of his own power; and to insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
that it is not will and choice, but force of
constitution that makes us sinners; that we are
born with such tainted principles, flesh so
stubborn, and appetites so impetuous, that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107262:6"/>
neither Rule nor Institution, nor Endeavour,
nor Grace it self can regulate them; and that
thereupon as <hi>Adam</hi> urged against God for the
first sin committed, <hi>The Woman that thou gavest
me beguiled me and I did eat:</hi> so his Posterity
might urge for all that have been committed
since, <hi>The Nature that thou hast allotted us,
has betrayed us, and we are sinners.</hi> Thus will
men dawb with <hi>untempered mortar</hi> (in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's
Allegory) <hi>though the wall shall be cast
down, and they in the midst of it.</hi> For to
assign the true measures of Nature in reference
to Defect, I lay down this for the Fundamental
Truth, That whatsoever there is, either of
impotence or positive malignity in our Natures,
it is onely such as is consistent both with the
Purity and Mercy of God; and therefore we
may certainly conclude, that it cannot be so
much as shall either administer matter of excuse
to those that will be bad, or argument of despair
to those that desiret o be good. We are born with
propensions to Vice, and appetites prone to
close with tempting Evils; but these are so far
from being actually evil themselves, that they
are the very life of Vertue, and foundation of
Reward. 'Tis true, they create difficulties in
vertue, and make the way rugged; but then
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107262:6"/>
God is pleased to consider these difficulties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgently;
and for that very reason he admits
man to terms of repentance and reconciliation;
whereas the Angels who were made of a purer
nature, and less obnoxious to temptation, were
allowed no such remedy. But moreover these
difficulties which our infirmity creates, are far
from being insuperable; we know our armour,
and we are commanded to fight, and we are
assured of Victory: whatsoever of strength we
have not in our selves, we know where to have
supplied, and whatsoever those excellencies
are which we deplore as lost in the Fall, the
Gospel assures us, that supervening Grace makes
a full repair of them. Grace is new light to
the understanding, and new power to the will,
and new regularity to the faculties that ought
to obey, and a new harmony to our whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composed
frame. In a word, Grace is more
to us now in the state of corruption, then in
the state of primitive perfection we could have
been to our selves. Whosoever therefore shall
consider the defects and impotence of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
state, together with the rich promises of
God in Christ, I know nothing that he ought
reasonably to argue or inferr thence but this,
that we now lie under a stricter obligation to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107262:7"/>
live in a perpetual dependance upon God; that
we have now a double tye to be Religious; that
is, both to serve God and our selves; foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as our addresses do not more effectually
pay him homage, then they do supply our own
wants. God could give without asking, if it
seemed good; but then perhaps we should be
more apt to glory as though we had not Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
whereas to receive when we want, is the
same thing in effect, as to have had it in store;
but with this advantage, that it makes us retain
a greater veneration for the Donor; as a man
is in greater probability to live humble and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
when he has his livelihood conferred on
him by daily dispensation, then if he had the
whole in entire possession. God could redin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrate
Nature, if it seemed good; and re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
her in her original rights and powers:
But then perhaps the man who now in the state
of corruption attributes his vices to his Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
not to his Will, would if he had been born
with greater strength and sufficiency have attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
the glory of his vertue to his own conduct
and not unto God; and so had he had in him lesse
of the sin of the man, he would have had more of
the sin of Lucifer, that is, pride and affectation.
'Tis a wise Rule in all things of Providence to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107262:7"/>
conclude, That that is best that now is; and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionless
it could not be better with us then it is,
notwithstanding all the infirmities of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
if we had but the happiness to make such use
of them as God intends, that is, to fix our depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
and application more strictly to himself.</p>
            <p>I pass in the second place to the Notion of
those that exalt Nature above her due measures,
&amp; invest her with such a self sufficiency, as would
make the Grace of God appear superfluous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quid opus est Votis?</hi> saith the Philosopher;
what need is there to pray? make thy self a
good man; 'tis idle to petition God for that
which thou canst bestow upon thy self. And
many among Christians (beside <hi>Pelagius</hi>) seem
to have consulted the Philosopher more then the
Scriptures, for their method of inculcating
Religion and a good life. They recommend
vertue in pompous harangues, and urge Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the Rational Topicks of conveniency
and inconveniency; they display the amiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and advantages of Good, and the deformity
and mischiefs of Evil. <q>How ugly is envy?
how tormenting is revenge? how brutal is
drunkenness? how pernicious is lust? On
the contrary, meekness, temperance and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence,
how serene are they in their state,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107262:8"/>
and how commodious in their effects? And
needs a man now (say they) any infusion
here to determine his choice? or any assisting
influence to put it in execution? All that
he seems to need is onely this, that he do not
turn fool, and desert the use of those faculties
and powers which Nature has given him.</q>
After such a Moral discourse as this, having
called upon Reason, and stirred up advertency
to apply it, they presume they have done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and leave us to grow good upon our
own stock and strength. But alas! these are
<hi>Icarus</hi> his flights, Nature has provided no
wings for man to soar so high with. Vice will
never be chas'd out of the world with Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives,
nor Vertue advanc'd to her Empire by
Panegyricks. The most prudent advertency,
and the most manly resolution; the most ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
love, and the most generous indignation
that ever Opinionative Morallist could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and fortifie his breast withall, will never
be able to secure a man against the subtle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
or the violent assaults of sin: 'Tis
onely the Divine Assistance that is our castle
and defence, and the vital spring of all our
good habits; and whosoever terminates his
hopes, even of serving and pleasing God, upon
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107262:8"/>
the confidence of any other strength then what
is derived from God, his hopes are impious,
and he must miscarry.</p>
            <p>'Tis true that Rational Arguments are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
nay necessary to excite a man to his duty;
which is a Rational service, and effected by
Rational endeavours, not lazy presumptions:
But then this is the point, A man must likewise
know, that when he is about his duty, he is
not sufficient for that which he is about: for
God has reserved a partial agency to himself,
and he does as much command our application
to him for this assistance, as he does demand all
the rest of our duty. For as God does require
us to keep his Commandments, so in order to
the doing of this, he does altogether as much
require us to Ask, to Seek, and to Knock;
that is, to apply our selves for ability to doe
what he commands: and therefore he who
shall undertake to reason and argue a man into
his duty, without insisting on the necessary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to God, does the same thing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance,
as if he should cut off the Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
legs, and provide him with a staff. That
one instance of S. <hi>Peter</hi> to our Saviour, <hi>Mat. 26.
Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107262:9"/>
thee;</hi> being as stout a Resolution, upon as
good motives, and from as honest a heart, as any
man else can ever dare to pretend to, has suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
baffled all humane confidence, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
that the opinion of strength in
our selves in vanity, and the issue of it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat.</p>
            <p>Having thus adjusted the true measures of
humane Nature, as consisting between the two
extremes of self-sufficiency to Good, and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
necessity to Evil: It results, that the not
making God our strength (which in one word
we may call Indevotion, <hi>Doeg's</hi> first charge in
my Text) is the great Parent Evil; an Evil
more prolifical in us then that of <hi>Adam;</hi> and
if we will with S. <hi>Augustin,</hi> attribute the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Origine of sin to a Deficient Cause, it
must be to this Defect of Application to God,
as being the first, the inlet, and the cause of
all others. For whatsoever inadvertencies a
man may be guilty of before, it is impossible
he should fall under the dominion of any viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
habits, untill he has first faln from this
Guard of the Divine Assistance. But then on
the other side, when a man has once by neglect
faln from this Guard; when either through
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107262:9"/>
desuetude, or infrequency, or meer formality
of devotion, he has suffered his mind to grow
alienated from God, and his dependance upon
him, to diminish and fail; that man is then ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
to a pitch, where it is as impossible for him
to stay, as it is to fix after the first step down a
precipice: He must go on, and his next genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
advance, is to the second Member of <hi>Doeg's</hi>
charge, <hi>(viz.) He trusted in the multitude of
his Riches.</hi> For</p>
            <p>The Soul of man, like common Nature, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
no <hi>Vacuum;</hi> if God be not there, Mammon
must be; and it is as impossible to serve neither,
as it is to serve both. And for this there is an
essential reason in our constitution; For Man
is designed and born an Indigent Creature, full
of wants and appetites, and a restless desire of
happiness, which he can by no means find with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
himself; and this indispensably obliges him
to seek for his happiness abroad: Now if he
seek his happiness from God, he answers the
very intention of his frame; and has made a
wise choice of an object, that is adequate to all
his wants and desires: But then if he does not
seek his happiness from God, he must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
seek it somewhere else; for his appetites
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107262:10"/>
cannot hang long undetermined, they are eager
and must have their quarry; <hi>If he forsake the
fountain of Living waters, yet he cannot forsake
his thirst;</hi> and therefore he lies under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of <hi>hewing out broken Cisterns to himself;</hi>
He must pursue, and at least promise himself
satisfaction in other enjoyments. Thus when
our Hope, our Trust, and our Expectations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
towards God, they do not abate in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but are onely scattered among undue
and inferiour Objects. And this makes the
connexion infallible between Indevotion, and
Moral Idolatry; that is, between the neglect of
God's worship, and worshipping the Creature;
for whatsoever share we abate towards God, we
always place upon something else; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
thing else we prosecute with that
share of love, desire, or complacency, which
is due unto God, that is in effect our Idol; as
is expressly declared in the case of Riches, <hi>Col.</hi>
3. 5. which is the particular matter I am to
treat about in this second part.</p>
            <p>Riches are Gods blessing, and the good man's
promise, and administer not onely the lawfull
comforts to Nature, but the greatest means and
opportunities to Vertue; and yet the managery
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107262:10"/>
of them is so nice and hazardous, and they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally
produce so much of evil, that, as the
Poets did therefore conclude them to come
from Hell, so the Scriptures tell us in earnest
that they generally tend thither.</p>
            <p>Not things themselves, but affections and
opinions about things are evil, says the Rule;
and it being so in the present case, I shall briefly
note some affections of men that thus pervert
Riches into evil.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I shall mention three.
<list>
                     <item>Excesse of Desire.</item>
                     <item>Mistake of Right.</item>
                     <item>And undue Complacency.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>The first respects Riches in Prospect, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two in Possession. I begin with Excess of
Desire.</p>
            <p>The Stoick's Wise man would have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
for fear of Disappointment; but 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Good man will have no great desire, for
fear of Impiety. For a great desire can hardly
be entertained without a secret quarrel with
providence, an unthankfulness for what is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and a preference of our own wish before
the good pleasure and ordination of God. When
the <hi>Israelites</hi> desired a King, they desired no
more then the completion of God's own promise
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107262:11"/>
to them; there was nothing sinfull in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
but the excesse of it; It was come to this,
<hi>Nay but we will have a King;</hi> and then God
sent them a King in his anger, and many infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
calamities during the whole course of his
reign. Nor was <hi>Rachel's</hi> desire of Children
any other then natural and just, till it came to
this impatience, <hi>Give me Children or else I die;</hi>
and then God disappointed her with a Grant,
and punisht her with her very wish; for she
died in Child-bearing. <hi>All things are lawfull
for me</hi> (says the Apostle) <hi>but I will not come
under the power of any;</hi> and so in like manner,
the desire of all things is lawfull, while it is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate,
but an impetuous desire grows a Master
in the Soul; it brings it under its power: and
our freedom, and our reason, and our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
too, must upon occasion submit to its
Tyranny. Hence it comes to pass, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of Riches does very often absolutely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
the soul, and turn the Temple of God
into meer Shop and Exchange. When the man
should be Religious, his thoughts are never at
home; they are abroad in attendance upon the
design in hand; and Mammon is the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
object of all his value and devotion.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107262:11"/>
God Almighty requires that the strongest brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
of our heart, should, like the smoak of
the Accepted Sacrifice, mount directly to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
but the Covetous man's desire does, like
the rejected smoak, incline all downwards, and
spend it self upon the Earth. He is restless in
contrivance, and hardy in pursuit; confident
in attempts, and bold and importunate in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses;
(and what is worse) he looks upon
sordid complyance, and base connivence, and
all the acts of dissimulation and fraud, as onely
provident methods of attaining his end. His
thoughts being thus in full employ, and his
imagination always busy, he lets time rowl over
his head, without making any reflexions wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
his immortal part; so that scarcely does
the poor Emet tug for a heap of earth, with more
toil, or less Religion then he.</p>
            <p>Thus does man in the first place vitiate Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
by Desire, and make them his sins before
they are his. But if they come into possession,
he vitiates them in the second place by Mistake
of Right.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain that the worldly man studies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so accurately as his Title to his Estate
and yet when all is done he mistakes it, for he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107262:12"/>
counts himself a Proprietor where he is but a
Steward. For the good things of this life being
by no means the Christians portion, God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
consigns them to us into Property, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into Trust. They employ the Manager, and
approve the Faithfull; but he that fails in his
accounts will find, that his Revenues are
his Debts. 'Tis therefore the Wise man's care
to make friends with the Mammon; to sow as
he hopes to reap; to justifie his expences, and
to blesse the stock by thankfulnesse, temperance
and charity: But he that assumes more right
then God has given, that is, he that takes what
he has to be absolutely his own, the first Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
he makes is this, that he may do with it
what he pleases; that he may either spend it
upon his own luxury, or hoard it up for that of
his Heirs; and thus he eludes all the obligations
of charity, and esteems the casting his bread
upon the waters as great a folly in the figure,
as it is in the letter. It was thus that <hi>Dives</hi> in
the Parable, had carved for himself, who when
he petitioned for a drop of water to allay his
torments, his mouth was stopped, and his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
rejected with this sole answer, <hi>Son re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that thou in thy life-time hadst thy good
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107262:12"/>
things.</hi> Questionlesse many a man has had
his good things in his life-time, and yet his
share after this life not a jot the lesse; but this
was <hi>Dives</hi> his case, he took the good things of
this life for his property, and his portion, and
used them accordingly; and therefore it was
that now he must expect no more.</p>
            <p>The third Affection whereby a man vitiates
his Riches is undue Complacency, which is an
Acquiescence of mind in the Object of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or (in the Scripture expression) <hi>a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our hearts upon it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A moderate complacency or satisfaction in
the good things of this world is requisite to
make a man thankfull, as a proportion of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
is necessary to sense; but an absolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency,
or rest in them, is (like a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of Spirits) a very stupor and losse of
mind. The best rule about Riches is to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse
them as though we possessed them not;
that is, to respect them with such an equality
of temper, as neither to place our happinesse in
their presence, nor our misery in their losse:
But the worldly man possesses them so, that he
is possest by them; they take in his heart, and
then fill it so compleatly, that he is not sensible
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107262:13"/>
of any other hunger or desire. How sweetly
does he sing, Soul take thy rest, for I am rich,
and increased with goods, and have need of
nothing? How securely does he sleep when
his senses drop tired from variety of diversions,
and lie lockt up in the fumes of agreeable jui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
Do we think that the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is like to suffer violence from such a man?
no, it is rather to be feared that he would count
Heaven it self a violence, and an overture of
change would shock and disgust him. For
what indeed should he do there? whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
are wholly levelled to the pleasures of
sense; of wines and meats, and their wanton
consequences; and who is no more apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
of immaterial joys, then the grossest brute
is of Musick or Picture. And here I limit the
second station of the Broad way; that is <hi>Doeg's</hi>
second charge, <hi>He trusted in the multitude of
his Riches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the sinner being advanc't thus far
through the neglect of Piety, and love of the
World, and finding his road gratefull, and the
return tedious, and the visage of repentance so
austere, that if he put himself under her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
he must lose all that he knows how to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107262:13"/>
prize; that is, gayety and pleasure, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
riches too: and these thoughts making
deeper impressions, then any thing future can,
upon a mind whose reasonings are now grown
weak, and consideration little; what can he
resolve but to go on? But because to go on, and
at the same time to look back, is distracting;
because reflexion upon guilt is a torment, and
a cowardly sinner is an insufferable penance,
he finds it necessary to take better courage;
that is, in the words of my third part, <hi>To,
strengthen himself in his wickedness:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he betakes himself to the two strong holds
of sin, Debauchery and Atheism, and thence
he bids defiance to Heaven. Like an ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Subject, who after he has long abused his
Prince, and his crimes are grown so great that
they cannot be compounded on easie terms, and
his stomach so haughty too, that he hates to
stoop to due submission and allegeance, He
draws his sword and flings away the scabbard,
and resolves to defend himself by a meditated
rebellion.</p>
            <p>The first strong hold that the rebel sinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
himself to is Debauchery, which in its
proper notion, is no more then an expresse art
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107262:14"/>
against Thinking. To indulge appetites and
gratifie senses, to live soft and delicate accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the scheme of studied pleasure, is the
businesse of the Voluptuous; but the Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chee
is not so choice: For his end is not so
much to please, as to amuze; and his whole
study is onely for a course of expedients how to
darken the mind, and divert thought, and
fence out reflexion. His wine is not to refresh
but to drown; and therefore he drinks not like
an Epicure, but rather like a <hi>Spartan</hi> Slave,
when he drunk to bring drinking into disgrace.
His Discourse is not for understanding, but for
noise. Noise is good company and wit; and
so with hurry and laughter, and any thing that
is loud, he stifles the remonstrances of Reason,
and murmurs of Conscience, as drum and
trumpet cover the cryes of a battel. He guards
himself against the awe of vertue, by an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
contempt of the good; and secures himself
against counsel, by a preventing derision of
the serious: He hates every solemn act, if it be
but a grace at his meal; lest the remembrance
of a God should check his jollity, and bridle
his excesse. But then, if notwithstanding all
this art, his body chance to tire under the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107262:14"/>
drudgery of vice, and so he be overtaken with
the intervals of apprehensive thoughts, the last
Refuge of his uneasie and desperate mind is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism.
And questionlesse, how poor a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
soever Atheism be, it was never any other
then Refuge: it is an Opinion that was never
offered by Reason, but always sought for by
Distresse. And this without doubt is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why one age of Christianity has produc'd
more Atheists, then were ever known in the
whole extent and duration of Heathenism; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Christian lying under greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions,
and therefore stronger pressures of
conscience, must needs be more forcibly urg'd
to fly to this Refuge, then the Heathen could
be, whose knowledge of sin and judgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lesse, his fears must necessarily be so too.
After the man has once resolved upon Atheism,
he does generally in the first place swear Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
to his Opinion; that is, he doth by
familiar forms of Oaths and raving Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
inculcate to himself that God is
nothing but a Mormoe or Bug-bear;
and so he hardens himself in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:107262:15"/>
In the next place he pronounces Religion a
Trick; contrived by the Art of Princes, and
conserved by the Interest of Priests; that if
ever any talk't wisely about Religion, it is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they who discard all particular positive
Religions, and stick onely to that of Nature.
But then what is Nature, or at least the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
of Nature, but common usage and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome?
And what is it that we have not Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
for? We have Custome for all sorts of
Vices; we have Custome for opposite Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
and for no Religion; and so in fine
from Nature can arise no Obligation at
all.</p>
            <p>In the next place the Doctrine of Spirits is
cryed down as absurd; and all the matters of
fact that tend to assert their being, can obtain
no more credit, then <hi>Lucian's</hi> raillery upon
the inchanted Broomstaff. But most of all ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
in his conceit, and unphilosophical
is the Doctrine of Immortal Souls. <q>For
what do Souls act above the power of subtle
matter in the state of Union? and how can
they disengage themselves from common pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
in the state of dissolution? The Beasts
approach very near us in our most wise and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107262:15"/>
sagacious operations without the hazard
of being Immortal; and why should man
fancy that hazard to himself? No, we
are born at all adventures; and we shall
be as though we had never been; and our
Spirits shall vanish into soft air.</q> And
now what can be done with a man of this
perswasion? 'Tis to as little purpose to tell
him of Hell and torments, as of <hi>Charon</hi> and
<hi>Cerberus;</hi> All is <hi>Par sollicito Fabula somnio,</hi>
as his Minion Poet hath concluded it;
And thus the Atheist is become as safe
and impregnable, as in a Castle of
Brasse.</p>
            <p>But alas the miserable dream of peace that
must wake into an eternity of real evils!
Alas the pityable Reasons that must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
by so sad an Experiment! For as
we have hitherto taken the prospect of the
sinner's way, so my Text requires us to look
a little farther, and advert his end. You
have seen what the man was; he was gay
and secure in his wickednesse: but now <hi>Lo
this is the man;</hi> this is his present state,
he is become a spectacle of vengeance, an
object of terrour and of scorn, and pointed out
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107262:16"/>
for a warning to all that shall come after.
Lo this is the Man that had shipwrackt his
Faith, and wasted his Conscience, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
his Mind, so that he had lost the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices
of what he should do, as well as the
care of what he did: But now his Miseries
have rectified his Notions; He believes and
trembles; He sees God again in the terrour
of his judgements; and is convinced by an
eternal dying, that the soul is subject to no
other death. He now lies scourged with past
enjoyments; and terrified with his present
passions: His Wit and Parts groan under
the Conviction of Folly; and his shame and
anguish are consummated by despair. But
my Text onely points at this; nor is it my
businesse to insist upon it any farther. I
have my end in minding you from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
that Sin and Judgement are insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
linkt together; That if we will escape
<hi>Doeg's</hi> end, we must avoid his way; That if
we will resist sin successfully, we must resist
it in its first Issues, and pluck up the roots of it,
which in passing I have discovered.</p>
            <p>And now that the most important of what I
have said, may be left more immediately upon
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107262:16"/>
your thoughts, I shall summe it up into one
sentence, and conclude: The lesson that the
whole example does most genuinely teach
us is this, That when a man once ceases to
take God for his strength, (which was <hi>Doeg's</hi>
first default) when he once neglects to apply
himself to Heaven for conduct and support,
that man naturally falls from one sin to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
and there is no security of stopping
betwixt Indevotion and the Bottomlesse
Pit.</p>
