            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving ſeen of late a little
Book entituled <hi>a Teſtimony
to the Truth of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi>
and finding my ſelfe by
name, liſted for an Heretick, in that I
have formerly Aſſerted that <hi>a Beleever is
perfect in this life, or never,</hi> which I yet
hold for a truth, ſeeing that as the tree
falleth ſo it ſhall lie, and it hath been the
Doctrin of reverend <hi>Hierom, Bolton, Dod,</hi>
and others; <hi>As the day of death leaveth
thee, the day of judgment ſhall find thee:</hi>
but to be convicted for an Heretick by
no other Argument but that female one,
it is ſo becauſe it is ſo, I cannot ſo be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied;
therefore my humble deſire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you is, that ſome one amongſt you
will be pleaſed to ſet forth from the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50341:3"/>
of the Holy-Scriptures (without
any of your fallible interpretations. The
time when, the place where, and the
means by which, a man that before hee
dyes is not perfectly made one with the
Father and the Sonne by the Spirit, but
ſhall be made ſo after death: It ſhall be
ſufficient unto me to retract my opinion
although I have nothing aſſerted but is
Scripture phraſe in the letter thereof, if
you pleaſe to conſider the ſame, ſeeing
the Apoſtle affirmeth on the behalf of his
brethren the Iewes. <hi>I bear</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 10. 2.</note> 
               <hi>them record
that they have a zeal of God, but not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to knowledge.</hi> Giveme leave to ſet
before you that glaſſe that hath plainly
ſhewn me my former miſtakes, when I
was zealus in my conformitie unto that
adminiſtration of the Prelacy, &amp; ſince of
that covenanted form of Independency,
thoſe that did know mee in either, can
bear me witneſſe of the truth of my zeal
unto my principles: but having a clear
manifeſtation of the true ground and
cauſe from whence ariſeth all the revy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
bitings and devourings that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
brethren, to be no other but that
old root of bitterneſſe which ſeparated
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50341:3"/>
               <hi>Adam</hi> from his Maker, namely Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Covetouſnes; his Ambition led
him no higher than God, but to be equal
with him in knowledge, his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſneſſe
led him out to that which was
none of his, either by gift or purchaſe:
the ſame principle of Ambition and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetuoſnes
remaineth, but in a different
manner, no more aſcending up ſo high
as God, for that way our necks were
broken; but now the deſigne is we will
fetch God down as low as our ſelves,
or we will have none of him, nay wee
will knock him out of the country, if
he dare to manifeſt himſelfe in any other
way then wee preſcribe him. As wee
may plainly ſee in <hi>Cain,</hi> when hee had
formed a ſacrifice in which he thought
GOD was bound to meet him, and
the way of <hi>Abel</hi> was accepted, and his
rejected; how was his countenance
caſt down, and wrath encreaſed againſt
his brother, ſo that nothing could ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
his diſconted ſoule, but the death of
his brother, that ſo hee might no more
be troubled with ſuch a manifeſtation of
God as appeared in him, which was
contrary unto his for me?<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 3. 5. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Korah</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50341:4"/>
all the people were holy, would
not allow that manifeſtation of God
unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> to be any whit ſuperlative
unto him, or any of the people, and
therefore ſtubbornly wee will not come
up.<note n="a" place="margin">Numb. 16. 12.</note> more particularly come and ſee
the reaſon why the Prophets of the Lord
could periſh no where but at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi>
where the temple of God was, the high
Prieſt that was anointed with holy oile,
the Tabernacle, the Mercy ſeat, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
of Incenſe, the daily ſacrifice, and
the Holy of Holies, where were the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
and yet in this place muſt the
Prophets fall.</p>
            <p>Vndoubtedly for no other cauſe but
that the Lord was pleaſed to manifeſt
himſelfe in them, unto the people in a
more ſpirituall and ſalubious manner
then he did appear in the Scribes who
were their expoſiters of the law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
ſeeing therein no farther than the
bare letter (the Prophets being no week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Lecturers, nor Maſters of any Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues)
but ſpake only when ſent, and as
the Spirit gave them utterance. It may
ſeem ſtrang that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> a Prophet of ſo
long ſtanding as to propheſie unto foure
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50341:4"/>
Kings, ſhould in his old age be by the
learned Rabbies awarded no better
death, than to bee ſawed in peices. It
muſt needs be for ſome grievous blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy;
two of which yee may find in
his propheſie<note n="a" place="margin">Iſa. 42. 1. 6. 7.</note> according to their expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
the firſt was that the Gentiles
ſhould be a glorious Church, the ſecond
was that which raigneth ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us now, namely hee preached
down<note n="b" place="margin">Iſa. 66. 3.</note> Ordinances, <hi>Hee that killeth an
Oxe as if he ſlew a man, he that ſacrificeth
a Lamb, as if he cut off a Dogges neck; he
that offereth an oblation as if hee offered
ſwines blood, he that burneth incenſe as if
he bleſſed an Idoll,</hi> this was blaſpheming
enough to deſerve the Sawe, and that
the firſt was blaſphemous enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
death, may appeare by that of St.
<hi>Paul Act. 22. 21. And he ſaid unto me
depart, for I will ſend thee far hence, unto
the gentiles,</hi> v. 22. <hi>And they gave him au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
unto this word, and then lift up their
voices and ſaid away with ſuch a fellow
from the earth, for it is not fit that he ſhould
live:</hi> ſo that to all ſuch now as are yet in
the miniſtration of <hi>Moſes,</hi> &amp; no farther,
can and will kill any that live higher a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50341:5"/>
Ordinances, in the Spirit, if they
can but get <hi>Pilate</hi> to give judgment, for
the like cauſes did all the reſt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
ſuffer, the being more ſpirituall,
God bearing witneſſe in them, did out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine
thoſe that lived in the bare letter
of Ordinances, and therefore could not
bear ſuch doctrines that did croſſe their
mouthes. Firſt, their Sacrifices and
their ſtanding before the Lord to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after his wil, their hypocritical hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations
and bowing downe the head
like a bulruſh. Theſe things with many
other ſpoken of by the Prophets, and
ſharply inveighed againſt; many more
(which I could mention, but for brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
I omit) were the only cauſes why
thoſe godly men according to the letter
did deale ſo inhumanely barbarous with
thoſe deare ſervants the Prophets of the
Lord, but you will ſay if the whole <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedrim</hi>
of the Iewes did conſent, how
came their Propheſies to be enrolled in
the cannon of holy writ? It is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that in all ages there were ſome few
that had their negative voice, and did
ſurvive the execution of thoſe horrid
councells and when good Magiſtrates
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50341:5"/>
reigned, then were thoſe records re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiwed,
&amp; then was enquiry made for
their Sepulchers to have them adorned;
and had we lived in the dayes of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
wee would not have killed the
Prophets of the Lord as they did, and
ſo the generations ſucceſſively filled up
the meaſure of their fathers iniquity;
more plainely, this is to bee ſeen in the
dayes of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, if wee
conſider well how he being ſo popular,
when hee came to ſave his life by the
vote of the people, loſt it ſo ſhamefully
that a Murtherer was preferred before
him, and the more ſtrang it is that their
affections but two dayes before were ſo
fixt on him, that they durſt enter into
the ſtrong garriſon of Ieruſalem, being
then under the command of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
<hi>Pilate</hi> being Governour; and
there openly to proclaim a new King of
the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> crying <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum
ſufficient to have brought them
to a Councell of Warre, and there they
might have thrown dice for their lives;
and yet theſe men upon ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
changed their minds, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
three dayes voted him to death. But
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50341:6"/>
you will ſay this was a giddy multitude
eaſie to bee drawn by cunning, crafty,
wicked men; the Iewiſh nation were
never accompted fooles in worldly
wiſdome, neither were theſe men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
but devout in expecting their
<hi>Meſias,</hi> and upon that accompt they
followed him from ſea to ſea to hear his
Doctrine, and ſee his Miracles, and
when ſpies were ſent to carp at him,
none ſo ready as they to juſtifie him,
as, when the Chriſt commeth will he
doe greater things than this man hath
done. And lo on an inſtant, crucifie him,
away with him, he is not worthy to
live. Lets enquire into the cauſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and ſurely you ſhall find it not to
proceed from lightneſſe, malice againſt
God, or from prophaneſſe, but rather
from their zeal unto God, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of his holy Ordinances, as
appeareth thus. Vpon this uproare
<hi>Caiphas</hi> calleth an aſſembly (not of
drunkards, ſwearers, and prophane
perſons) but of the moſt reverend
Prieſts,<note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 11. 49. 50.</note> Scribes, Phariſees, and devout
men, that walked conſtantly in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of all Religious duties to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50341:6"/>
God, according to the faſhion
of the Church in thoſe dayes; and ſome
of them had walked in all good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
towards God, as concerning the
Law, unblameable unto that day.</p>
            <p>Now ſaith he, Ye know nothing at
all, neither do ye conſider that our nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is like to periſh, if this Ieſus remain
alive, you are ſo conſciencious of ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
bloud leaſt he ſhould be a Prophet,
and ſo you thinke you ſhall thereby fill
up the meaſure of our Fathers iniquitie;
but we muſt ſometimes act Providenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
as well as Piouſly and Iuſtly; and
therefore whether is it better that one
man ſhould dye, or a whole Nation pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh?
this is now put to the vote, and
carryed in the affirmative, onely two
are in the negative <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi>
and <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> but heer is the quaere,
the people ſo doate on him, that they
will ſtone us, we muſt therefore get him
by night, and when we have ſeiz'd him
we ſhall eaſily draw off the people from
him: for in deed and truth he is not of
God, but doth all his works by Belze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub,
and thus the people ſhall clearly ſee
when wee have gotten him: Chriſt is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50341:7"/>
now in their hands by the treaſon of his
owne ſervant, and that in the night
when the multitude was aſleep, and
now the people are called in having ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
his perſon from their reach; and
now the high Prieſt begins to act his
part, beginning thus or the like, brethren
you are the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of
the noble ſtock of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> to whom are
committed the Oracles of God, and you
are all of you devout and zealous to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, as we are this day, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of the Fathers, for ye are ſure
that God ſpake with <hi>Moſes;</hi> but I ſhall
make it appear unto, that all that this
man hath done is by the power of Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub,
for you may be aſſured that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
keepeth not the commandements
which <hi>Moſes</hi> gave us, is not of God,
and when this doth appeare, you will
have other thoughts of him, call in the
witneſſes, doth this man, your great Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phet,
keep the Sabboth day? nothing
leſſe, he works himſelfe, and juſtifies o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
alſo he made clay for a plaiſter, he
allowed his Diſciples to gather corn, he
commanded the impotent man to carry
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50341:7"/>
his Bed, he cured the withered hand,
and many more ſuch pranks he doth on
the Sabboth day: well, what thinke ye,
is he a friend to our nation? or doth he
not complot with the Romans to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy

he bids us <hi>Give unto</hi> Caeſar <hi>the things
that were</hi> Caeſars, <hi>and unto God, the things
that are Gods;</hi> ſee he cares not how he
burtheneth the nation. What thinke ye
of him concerning the Ordinances and
the Temple, doth he maintain them?
here is witneſs that he did intend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the Temple: a very good teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
what ſayeſt thou to all that is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed
againſt thee, anſwereſt thou no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for thy ſelfe? we intend to doe
nothing againſt thee but juſtice; nay,
thou ſhalt have mercy from us, ſo farre
as it may not empeach the glory of God
for which our zeale is purely fervent.
Chriſt anſwers nothing, as if he were
ſure the major vote of the people would
carry it for him,</p>
            <p>He is now commanded to withdraw,
and now the Preiſts turne to the people

ſome of the wiſer and more conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
amongſt them demur'd upon it, the
witneſſes not agreeing fully in every
punctilio to the Articles exhibited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him: now the Prieſt replyes I
ſee a mighty beſottedneſſe upon your
ſpirits; the breach of the Sabbath, the
deſtruction of the Temple, the laying
aſide of Ordinances is nothing with
you, I think you will tollerate Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
likewiſe (nay) there is no blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
proved againſt him, but what if
you hear him blaſpheme to your faces?
call him in againe: Come ſir you have
hard thoughts of us, as if we intended
to take away thy life right or wrong,
which appeares to us by thy ſilent car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
towards us; but I would have
thee know wee are holy conſciencious
men, and do earneſtly wait for the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi>
and if wee were ſure thou wert
him, we would worſhip thee, this ſet
the people right to judge of him: now
followes the oath <hi>ex officio.</hi> I adjure
thee by the living God to tell us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou be the Chriſt the ſon of the
living God. <hi>Thou haſt ſaid; nevertheles

I ſay unto you, hereafter ſhall yee ſee the

and comming in the clouds of Heaven.</hi>
Now yee have heard his blaſphemy.
<hi>Mat. 26.</hi> v. 66, to 68. See then how
prieſt and people (though devout) were
tranſported into a frantick zeale, for
preſerving God from being blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
not being able to bear the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy
of God in the fleſh, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the betrayers and murtherers of
the Lord of life, and ſo thoſe people
that but even now feared no danger for
Chriſt, being no higher principled than
in the carnall commandement of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> which is but
the utter Court of the Temple, were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
drawn aſide (by the ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of that ſeeming godlineſſe which
the Scribes and Phariſees lived in, and
thereby deceived themſelves as well as
the people) and ſo thought it a more Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
equitable work to vote, that a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer
(who was penitent) ſhould live,
than to preſerve a Blaſphemer, that
continues in his ſinne, and ſo diſturbes
the peace of their carnall Church. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſame accompt did our Popiſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50341:9"/>
deſtroy the Lollards, and burne
the Martyrs, not becauſe they were
godly people, but becauſe they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
Hereticks, yet wee condemne
them as great perſecutors of the Saints:
and yet we muſt make up the meaſure of
our Fathers iniquity? if <hi>Penry Barraw</hi>
and <hi>Grenwel</hi> will be ſo bold as to affirme
Biſhops to be Antichriſtian, he muſt
hang for it, in the dayes of famous <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth;</hi>

conclude our Clergy to be maliciouſly
wicked, but what they did was in order
to the peace of the Church, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God, as it did then appeare unto
them. Chriſt told <hi>Peter</hi> that fleſh and
bloud revealed not that confeſſion; as
if he ſhould have ſaid, If thou hadſt all
the Divinities of the Preiſts, Scribes,
Phariſees, and learned Grecians, nay, if
thou hadſt been Doctor of the Chair in
Oxford and Cambridge, all theſe, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of theſe can reveal me, but my Father
which is in Heaven; and therefore the
time ſhall come, and ſtill is that the
Rabbies of the Churches ſhall thinke
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50341:9"/>
they doe God good ſervice when they
kill my beloved ones.</p>
            <p>Now my deare hearts, and fellow
members in that glorious head the Lord
Chriſt Ieſus, bee not bitter in your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and judge nothing before the time;
experience is the beſt teacher, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to you that are not privy to your
ſelves of any ſecret ſelviſhneſſe, but
are ſimply and purely zealous for God,
as was <hi>Saul,</hi> and will not knowingly
ſmite or offend the leaſt of Chriſts mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
I ſay let me be bold in love to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
unto you my former experience in
the myſterie of Chriſt. I thought a long
while a faith in Ieſus, that dyed at
Ieruſalem, was the top gallant of a
Chriſtian, but ſince it doth cleerly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that all the faith the diſciples had
in Chriſt their Maſter, which was a
faith only without, and none of the
miſtery of Chriſt within them. I ſay
that faith in the perſon of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
dyed with him, ſo that when he was
dead there was not one that did expect
ever to ſee him againe; for <hi>Mary</hi> went
not to ſee whether he was riſen, but to
anoint his dead body; yea the diſciples
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50341:10"/>
who had ground enough for belief, could
be ſo charitable as to judge <hi>Mary</hi> to bee
no better than a lyer, in reporting fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
things, affirming that he was riſen,
and we truſted it had been him that
ſhould have delivered Iſrael, ſaid the
two diſciples, but he is dead; ſo that its
clear all the faith they had in Ieſus dyed
with Ieſus: now the Apoſtle tels you
<hi>Phil. 3. 9. That we may be found in him:
not having mine own righteouſneſſe which
is of the law, but that which is through the
faith of Chriſt (not in Chriſt) the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
which of God by faith.</hi> And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it is not ſufficient that wee beleeve
there was ſuch a one dyed at Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,
and God was fully pleaſed in him.
But the ſame Apoſtle tels you, <hi>Col. 1.
24. That as the head paſſed through ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
ſo there is a remainder of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Chriſt in our fleſh, for the bodyes ſake.</hi>
And ver. 27. <hi>And that it ſufficeth not that
there is a Chriſt without us. But Chriſt
in you the hope of glory.</hi> And therefore
it is Chriſt in the miſtery that will ſave;
a wooden leg that is tyed on may doe
ſome ſervice, but the leg that is naturally
fixt is uſefull for all occaſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeing by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50341:10"/>
all thoſe former examples, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
the Lord Ieſus, the holy Martyrs,
not one of them in their generation, died
as the ſervants of the Lord, but as blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers
and dangerous hereticks, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the account of the reverend
Clergy then living, whoſe zeal (for God
and the preſervation of the peace and
purity of holy mother Church, to
preſerve the glory of the one, and the
honour of the other, was the principle
cauſe that led them forth to deal ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly
with them. Now ſeeing that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matchable
Phariſee <hi>Saul</hi> (which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
in the church of God in that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
was accounted moſt pious)
that could ſay as concerning the law he
was unblameable in his converſation)
being mad in his zeale for God, againſt
the dear Saints of God. Conſider in how
deſperate a condition he was in, when
going to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> if mercy had not
met him: and ſeeing the Lord Ieſus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
in his church, never a Conſtable
nor Iuſtice of peace to meddle with any
of his Saints, why are you ſo importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to call in the Magiſtrate for your
aſſiſtance, ſeeing you doe not produce
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50341:11"/>
your warrant or preſident from him, &amp;
ſeeing I find but one civill officer in his
family, namely a Treaſurer: and for his
ſake, be ſo courteous as not in the leaſt
to engage the civill Magiſtrate with his
corrective power to enforce any man to
be a beleever, before that holy ſpirit
convince him, ſo ſhall the church more
probably bee freed from hypocriſie and
backſliding, and you ſhall not through
miſtakes attract any guilt upon them
or your ſelves; and the rather becauſe
you ingeniouſly confeſſe that you do but
conceive this way you preſcribe to bee
the right way.</p>
            <p>See how our grandmother <hi>Eve</hi> was
deceived in her conception when ſhee
brought forth <hi>Cain,</hi> it could be no leſſe
then the <hi>Meſiah,</hi> as ſhe thought; and lo
a Murtherer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Abraham</hi> a Prophet of
the Lord, and the father of the faithfull,
thought he had gotten the heire of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
when he had <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and hee had
nothing but a perſecuting ſcoffer, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
take heed of zeal not rightly enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
and ſurely thoſe ſeverall forty
ſtripes ſave one, which <hi>Paul</hi> ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
met with, will fall very ſmart upon
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50341:11"/>
his back, that will at any time take the
boldneſſe (upon his fallible judgement)
to lend them unto any Saint; and ſurely
it will not repent any Saint of God that
he did not enterpriſe to grieve the leaſt
little one, that beleeveth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſweetly <hi>David, 1 Sam. 25. 33, 34<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
By which counſel he was diverted from
executing the determination of his
counſell of War; conſider ſeriouſly who
they were that perſecuted Ieſus Chriſt,
the Prophets, and the Martyrs, were
the men that did openly profeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
enemies to godlineſſe, nothing
leſſe; ſuppoſe in the dayes of Chriſt
Ieſus the people would have had Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
reformed, who ſhould have been
choſen for the Aſſembly? doubtleſſe it
muſt have been Scribes and Phariſees,
and no Publicans; ſurely <hi>Gamaliel</hi> was
likely to have been Prolocutor, and his
diſciple <hi>Saul</hi> might have been the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
notary; and yet ſee how theſe
learned ſoules in their zeal for God
were miſtaken; leave all the reſt, and
to our preſent time, how many of our
reverend Divines in the time of their
Prelaticall obedience, how earneſtly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50341:12"/>
did they contend for the upholding of
the Leturgie, againſt ſuch as oppoſed it:
which now they caſt out with tonges
and ſlice. And had Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> not
ſteadfaſtly beleeved God was highly
concerned in thoſe materiall churches,
and that mens cringing and crouching
were of high concernment before God,
he would never have run the hazard of
his head as he did. It is good to be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
affected alwayes in a good thing.
<hi>Gal. 4. 18. And having no other ground
but our fallible conceptions to guide our
ſelves and others by, let us be very tender of
enforcing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Chriſt alone having the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
upon his ſhoulders who is
only wiſe and infallible, and ſeeing the
temple is filled with ſmoake and that he
wil bring his people into the wildernes
and plead with them, and that tongues
ſhall ceaſe, and ye ſhall no more ſay one
to another know the Lord, but ye ſhall
be all taught of me, from the greateſt
to the leaſt, why ſhall we limit the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one of Iſrael, and ſay the time is not
yet? And ſeeing he hath a fanne in his
hand, he wil throughly purge his floor.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50341:12"/>
And bee not like thoſe officious huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen,
who no ſooner thought they
ſaw a blade like a tare, but they muſt be
picking of it up; the anſwer was, let both
grow together untill harveſt, and unto
<hi>Iames</hi> &amp; <hi>Iohn,</hi> ye wot not of what ſpirit
ye are of, I come not to deſtroy but to
ſave. It may ſeem here is begging for a
tolleration; for my ſelf I paſſe not what
men conclude on in the matters of God,
if they break his bonds, caſt away his
cords, and will not have Chriſt to raign
over them, they are but laught at, and
will fall to pieces, knowing and being
wel aſſured that there is a reſt for the
people of God, and they that enter
into it ceaſe from their workes as God
did from his, and that the kingdomes
and the powers ſhall ſerve the Lord
Chriſt in the Saints, and this ſufficeth
me.</p>
