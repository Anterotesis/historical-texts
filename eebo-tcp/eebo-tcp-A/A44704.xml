            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

motion; and the <hi>Mind</hi> can have no rest whilst it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd by a darling Passion. <hi>You</hi> are at present the chief Object of my <hi>Care,</hi> as well as of my <hi>Kindness,</hi> which sometimes throweth me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Visions</hi> of your being happy in the World, that are better suited to my partial <hi>Wishes,</hi> than to my reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Hopes</hi> for you. At other times, when my <hi>Fears</hi> prevail, I shrink as if I were struck at the prospect of <hi>Danger,</hi> to which a young Woman must be expos'd.

full of Innocence, the spiteful World will bite, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you are guarded by your <hi>Caution.</hi> Want of <hi>Care</hi> therefore, my dear Child, is never to be excus'd; since, as to this World, it hath the same effect as want of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi> Such an early sprouting Wit requireth to be so much the more sheltred by some <hi>Rules,</hi> like something strew'd on tender Flowers to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them from being bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted. You must take it well to be prun'd by so kind a Hand as that of a <hi>Father.</hi> There may be some bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in meer Obedience: The natural Love of <hi>Liberty</hi> may help to make the Commands of a Parent harder to go

down. Some inward resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance there will be, where <hi>Power</hi> and not <hi>Choice</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth us move; but when a <hi>Father</hi> layeth aside his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and persuadeth only by his Kindness, you will never answer it to Good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if it hath not weight with you.</p>
               <p>A great part of what is said in the following <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>course</hi> may be above the present growth of your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; but that becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every day taller, will in a little time reach up to it, so as to make it easie to you.

               <head>RELIGION.</head>
               <p>THe first thing to be considered, is <hi>Religion</hi>: It must be the chief Object of your Thoughts, since it would be a vain thing to direct your <hi>Behaviour</hi> in the World, and forget that which you are to have towards him who made it. In a strict sense, it is the only thing necessary: you must take it into your <hi>Mind,</hi> and thence throw it into your <hi>Heart,</hi> where you are to embrace it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43557:7"/>
so close, as never to lose the <hi>Possession</hi> of it. But then it is necessary to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Reality and the Pretence. <hi>Religion</hi> doth not consist in believing the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend of the <hi>Nursery,</hi> where Children with their <hi>Milk</hi> are fed with the Tales of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, Hobgoblins, Prophecies, and Miracles. We suck in so greedily these early <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes,</hi> that our riper Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing hath much ado to cleanse our <hi>Minds</hi> from this kind of <hi>Trash</hi>: The Stories are so entertaining, that we do not only believe them, but relate them; which makes the discovery of the <hi>Truth</hi> somewhat grievous, when it makes us lose such a Field
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43557:8"/>
of Impertinence, where we might have diverted our selves, besides the shame thrown upon us for having ever receiv'd them. This is making the <hi>World</hi> a <hi>Feast,</hi> and imputing to God Almighty, That the Province he assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Devil, is to play at Blind-mans-buff, and shew Tricks with Mankind; and is so far from being <hi>Religion,</hi> that it is not <hi>Sense,</hi> and hath right only to be call'd that kind of Devotion, of which, <hi>Ignorance</hi> is the undoubted <hi>Mother,</hi> without competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or dispute. These Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes are therefore to be left off with your Hanging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleeves; and you ought to be as much out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43557:8"/>
to be found with them about you, as to be seen playing with Babies, at an <hi>Age</hi> when other things are expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from you.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd to you, is, That <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> doth as little consist in loud Answers and devout Convulsions at Church, or Praying in an extraordinary manner. Some Ladies are so extreme stirring at <hi>Church,</hi> one would swear the <hi>Worm</hi> in their <hi>Conscience</hi> made them so unquiet. Others will have such a Divided Face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>Devout Goggle</hi> and an <hi>Inviting Glance,</hi> that the unnatural Mixture maketh even their <hi>best Looks</hi> to be at that time <hi>ridiculous.</hi> These
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43557:9"/>
affected Appearances are ever suspected, like very strong Perfumes, which are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought no very good Symptoms in those that make use of them. Let your ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness therefore be reserv'd for your <hi>Closet,</hi> where you may have God Almighty to your self: In <hi>Publick</hi> be still and calm, neither indecently <hi>Careless,</hi> or <hi>Affected</hi> in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Extream.</p>
               <p>It is not true Devotion, to put on an angry <hi>Zeal</hi> against those who may be of a differing Persuasion. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality</hi> to our selves makes us often mistake it for a <hi>Duty,</hi> to fall hard upon others in that case; and being push'd on with <hi>Self-conceit,</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:43557:9"/>
we strike without mercy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that the <hi>Wounds</hi> we give are <hi>Meritorious,</hi> and that we are fighting God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's Quarrel; when the truth is, we are only setting out our selves. Our <hi>Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> too often breaketh out into that <hi>Shape</hi> which most agreeth with our particular Temper. The <hi>Cholerick</hi> grow into a hardned Severity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all who dissent from them, snatch at all the Texts of Scripture that suit with their <hi>Complexion</hi>; and because God's Wrath was some time kindled, they conclude, That <hi>Anger</hi> is a Divine Vertue; and are so far from imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that their ill-natur'd <hi>Zeal</hi> requireth an <hi>Apology,</hi> that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43557:10"/>
they value themselves upon it, &amp; triumph in it. <hi>Others,</hi> whose Nature is more Credulousthan ordinary, admit no Bounds or Measures to it; they grow as proud of extending their <hi>Faith,</hi> as Princes are of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging their <hi>Dominions</hi>; not considering, that our <hi>Faith,</hi> like our Stomach, is capable of being over-charg-d; and that as the Last is destroy'd by taking in more than it can digest, so our <hi>Reason</hi> may be extinguish'd by oppressing it with the weight of too many strange things; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if we are forbidden to chew what we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to swallow. The <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly</hi> and the <hi>Sullen</hi> are apt to place a great part of their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43557:10"/>
                  <hi>Religion</hi> in Dejected and Ill-humour'd Looks, putting on an unsociable Face, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming against the Innocent Entertainments of <hi>Life,</hi> with as much sharpness as they could bestow upon the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>Crimes.</hi> This generally is only a <hi>Vizard,</hi> there is sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom any thing real in it. No other thing is the better for being <hi>Sowre</hi>; and it would be hard that <hi>Religion</hi> should be so, which is the best of things. In the mean time it may be said with truth, That this <hi>surly</hi> kind of <hi>Devotion</hi> hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps done little less hurt in the World, by frighting, than the most scandalous <hi>Examples</hi> have done by infecting it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:43557:11"/>Having told you, in these few Instances, to which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more might have been added, what is not true <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>; it is time to describe to you; what is so. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>Definitions</hi> are no more like it, than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sign-posts are like the Princes they would represent; the unskilful <hi>Dawbers</hi> in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges have generally laid on such ill <hi>Colours,</hi> and drawn such harsh <hi>Lines,</hi> that the Beauty of it is not easily to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd: They have put in all the forbidding Features that can be thought of; and in the first place, have made it an irreconcileable Enemy to <hi>Nature</hi>; when, in reality, they are not only <hi>Friends,</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:43557:11"/>
but <hi>Twins,</hi> born together at the same time; and it is do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing violence to them both, to go about to have them separated. Nothing is so kind and so inviting as true and <hi>Unsophisticated Religion:</hi> In stead of imposing unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Burdens upon our <hi>Nature,</hi> it easeth us of the greater weight of our <hi>Passions</hi> and <hi>Mistakes</hi>: In stead of subduing us with <hi>Rigour,</hi> it redeemeth us from the <hi>Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> we are in too our selves, who are the most severe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, whilst we are under the Usurpation of our <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites</hi> let loose and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Religion</hi> is a chearful thing, so far from being always at
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43557:12"/>
                  <hi>Cuffs</hi> with <hi>Good Humour,</hi> that it is inseparably united to it. Nothing unpleasant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to it, though the <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Cooks</hi> have done their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful part to give an ill <hi>Relish</hi> to it. A wise Epicure would be <hi>Religious</hi> for the sake of <hi>Pleasure</hi>: Good Sense is the Foundation of both; and he is a <hi>Bungler</hi> who aimeth at true <hi>Luxury,</hi> but where they are joyn'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Religion</hi> is exalted <hi>Reason,</hi> refin'd and sifted from the grosser parts of it: It dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the upper Region of the <hi>Mind,</hi> where there are no <hi>Clouds</hi> or <hi>Mists</hi> to dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or offend it: It is both the Foundation and the Crown of all Vertues: it is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43557:12"/>
                  <hi>Morality</hi> improv'd and rais'd to its height, by being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried nearer <hi>Heaven,</hi> the only place where Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection resideth. It cleanseth the <hi>Understanding,</hi> and brush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth off the Earth that hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about our <hi>Souls.</hi> It doth not want the <hi>Hopes</hi> and the <hi>Terrors</hi> which are made use of to support it: neither ought it to descend to the borrowing any Argument out of it self, since there we may find every thing that should invite us. If we were to be hired to <hi>Religion,</hi> it is able to out-bid the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted World, with all it can offer to us, being so much the <hi>Richer</hi> of the too in every thing where <hi>Reason</hi> is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43557:13"/>
to be Judge of the Value. Since this is so, it is worth your pains to make <hi>Religion</hi> your choice, and not make use of it only as a <hi>Refuge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are Ladies, who finding by the too visible decay of their good Looks, that they can shine no more by that <hi>Light,</hi> put on the <hi>Varnish</hi> of an affected Devotion, to keep up some kind of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in the World; they take Sanctuary in the <hi>Church,</hi> where they are pursued by growing <hi>Contempt,</hi> which will not be stopt; but followeth them to the <hi>Altar</hi>: such late penitence is only a disguise for the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting grief of being no more handsom. That is the killing thought which draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43557:13"/>
the sighs and tears, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear outwardly to be applied to a better end.</p>
               <p>There are many who have and <hi>Aguish Devotion,</hi> Hot and Cold Fits, long Intermissions, and violent Raptures; this unevenness is by all means to be avoided: let your method be a steady course of good <hi>Life,</hi> that may run like a smooth Stream, and be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Spring to furnish to the continued <hi>Exercise</hi> of <hi>Vertue.</hi> Your <hi>Devotion</hi> may be earnest, but it must be unconstrained; and like other Duties, you must make it your <hi>Pleasure</hi> too, or else it will have but very little effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy. By this <hi>Rule</hi> you may best judge of your own
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43557:14"/>
Heart. Whilst these <hi>Duties</hi> are <hi>Joys,</hi> it is an Evidence of their being sincere; but when they are a <hi>Penance,</hi> it is a sign that your Nature ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth some resistance; and whilst that lasteth, you can never be entirely secure of your self.</p>
               <p>If you are often unquiet, and too nearly touch'd by the cross Accidents of <hi>Life,</hi> your <hi>Devotion</hi> is not of the right <hi>Standard,</hi> there is too much <hi>Allay</hi> in it. That which is right and unmixt, taketh away the <hi>Sting</hi> of every thing that would trouble you: It is like a healing <hi>Balm,</hi> that extinguisheth the sharpness of the Blood; so this softneth and dissolveth the <hi>Anguish</hi> of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43557:14"/>
the <hi>Mind.</hi> A devout <hi>Mind</hi> hath this Privilege, of being free from <hi>Passion,</hi> as some Climates are from all manner of venomous kind of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; it will raise you above the little <hi>Vexations</hi> to which others for want of it, will be expos'd, and will bring you to a <hi>Temper,</hi> not of stupid <hi>Indifference,</hi> but of such a wife <hi>Resignation,</hi> that you may live in the <hi>World,</hi> so as it may hang about you like a loose Garment, and not tied too close to you.</p>
               <p>Take heed of running into that common <hi>Error,</hi> of apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's Judgments upon particular Occasions. Our Weights and Measures are not competent to make the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43557:15"/>
either of his <hi>Mercy</hi> or his <hi>Justice</hi>: He hath thrown a Veil over these things, which makes it not only an <hi>Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,</hi> but a kind of <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,</hi> for us to give Sentence in them without his <hi>Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to your particular <hi>Faith,</hi> keep to the <hi>Religion</hi> that is grown up with you, both as it is the best in it self, and that the reason of staying in it upon that Ground is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what stronger for your <hi>Sex,</hi> than it will perhaps be allow'd to be for ours; in respect that the Voluminous Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries into the <hi>Truth,</hi> by Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are less expected from you. The <hi>Best</hi> of <hi>Books</hi> will be direction enough to you
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43557:15"/>
not to change; and whilst you are fix'd and sufficiently confirm'd in your own <hi>Mind,</hi> you'l do best to keep vain <hi>Doubts</hi> and <hi>Scruples</hi> at such a distance, that they may give you no disquiet. Let me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to you a Method of being rightly inform'd, which can never fail: it is in short this: Get <hi>Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and practice <hi>Vertue</hi>; and if you are so <hi>Blessed</hi> as to have these for your <hi>Share,</hi> it is not surer that there is a <hi>God,</hi> than it is, that by him all <hi>Necessary Truths</hi> will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to you.</p>

               <p>THAT which challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the next place in your Thoughts, is, How to live with a <hi>Husband</hi>: And though that is so large a Word, that few <hi>Rules</hi> can be fix'd to it which are unchangeable, the <hi>Methods</hi> being as various as the several <hi>Tempers</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> to which they must be suited; yet I cannot omit some <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Observations,</hi> which, with the help of your own, may the better direct you in the part of your Life upon which your <hi>Happiness</hi> most dependeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:43557:16"/>It is one of the Disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages belonging to your <hi>Sex,</hi> that young Women are sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom permitted to make their own <hi>Choice</hi>; their Friends Care and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are thought safer Guides to them, than their own <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>; and their <hi>Modesty</hi> often forbiddeth them to refuse when their Parents recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, though their <hi>inward Consent</hi> may not entirely go along with it: In this case there remaineth nothing for them to do, but to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make that easie which falleth to their <hi>Lot,</hi> and by a wife use of every thing they may dislike in a <hi>Husband,</hi> turn that by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to be very supportable,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43557:17"/>
which, if neglected, might in time beget an <hi>Aversion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You must first lay it down for a Foundation in general, That there is <hi>Inequality</hi> in the <hi>Sexes,</hi> and that for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Oeconomy of the World, the <hi>Men,</hi> who were to be the Law-givers, had the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger share of <hi>Reason</hi> bestow'd upon them; by which means your Sex is the better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for the <hi>Compliance</hi> that is necessary for the better perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of those <hi>Duties</hi> which seem'd to be most properly assign'd to it. This looks a little uncourtly at the first appearance; but upon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination it will be found, that <hi>Nature</hi> is so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unjust to you, that she
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43557:17"/>
is partial on your side: She hath made you such large <hi>Amends</hi> by other Advantages, for the seeming <hi>Injustice</hi> of the first Distribution, that the Right of Complaining is come over to our Sex; you have it in your power not only to free your selves, but to subdue your Masters, and without violence throw both their <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Legal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> at your Feet. We are made of differing <hi>Tempers,</hi> that our <hi>Defects</hi> might be mutually supplied: Your <hi>Sex</hi> wanteth our <hi>Reason</hi> for your <hi>Conduct,</hi> and our <hi>Strength</hi> for your <hi>Protection: Ours</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth your <hi>Gentleness</hi> to soften, and to entertain us. The first part of our Life is a good
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43557:18"/>
deal of it subjected to you in the <hi>Nursery,</hi> where you Reign without Competition, and by that means have the advantage of giving the first <hi>Impressions</hi>; afterwards you have stronger Influences, which, well manag'd, have more force in your behalf, than all our <hi>Priviledges</hi> and <hi>Jurisdictions</hi> can pretend to have against you. You have more strength in your <hi>Looks,</hi> than we have in our <hi>Laws</hi>; and more power by your <hi>Tears,</hi> than we have by our <hi>Arguments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, that the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Marriage,</hi> run in a harsher stile towards your <hi>Sex. Obey</hi> is an ungentle word, and less easie to be digested, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43557:18"/>
such an unkind distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Words of Contract, and so very unsuitable to the excess of <hi>Good Manners,</hi> that generally goes before it; besides, the <hi>universality</hi> of the Rule seemeth to be a <hi>Grievance,</hi> and it appeareth reasonable, that there might be an <hi>Exemption</hi> for extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Women, from ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Rules, to take away the just Exception that lieth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the false measure of <hi>general Equality</hi>: it may be alledged by the <hi>Council</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by your Sex, as there is in all other Laws, an Appeal from the <hi>Letter</hi> to <hi>Equity</hi> in Cases that require it, It is as reasonable, that some <hi>Court</hi> of a larger <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> might
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43557:19"/>
be erected, where some Wives might resort and plead, <hi>espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,</hi> and in such Instances, where Nature is so kind, as to raise them above the <hi>level</hi> of their own Sex, that they might have <hi>Relief,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a <hi>Mitigation</hi> in their own particular, of a Sentence which was given generally against <hi>Woman-kind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The causes of <hi>Separation</hi> are now so very course, that few are <hi>confident</hi> enough to buy their <hi>Liberty</hi> at the price of having their Modesty so exposed, and for <hi>disparity of Minds,</hi> which above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things requireth a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,</hi> the <hi>Laws</hi> have made no <hi>provision</hi>; so little refin'd are numbers of Men, by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43557:19"/>
whom they are compil'd. This, and a great deal more might be said to give a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to this Complaint; but the Answer is, in short, That the <hi>Institution</hi> of <hi>Marriage</hi> is too sacred to admit of a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> of <hi>Objection</hi> to it; that the Supposition of your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the weaker Sex, having without all doubt a good Foundation, maketh it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to subject it to the <hi>Masculine Dominion</hi>; that no <hi>Rule</hi> can be so <hi>perfect,</hi> as not to admit some <hi>Exceptions</hi>; but the Law presumeth there would be so few found in this Case, who would have a sufficient Right to such a Privilege, that it is safer some <hi>Injustice</hi> should be <hi>conniv</hi>'d
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43557:20"/>
at in a very few Instances, than to break into an Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment, upon which the Order of Humane Society doth so much depend. You are therefore to make the best of what is <hi>setled</hi> by <hi>Law</hi> and Custom, and not vainly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that it will be <hi>changed</hi> for your sake. But that you may not be discouraged, as if you lay under the weight of an <hi>incurable Grievance,</hi> you are to know, that by a <hi>wife</hi> and <hi>dexterous</hi> Conduct, it will be in your power to <hi>relieve</hi> your self from any thing that looketh like a disadvantage in it. For your better dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I will give a hint of the most ordinary <hi>Causes</hi> of <hi>Dissatisfaction</hi> between Man
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43557:20"/>
and Wife, that you may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by such a <hi>Warning</hi> to live so upon your <hi>Guard,</hi> that when you shall be married, you may know how to <hi>cure</hi> your Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's <hi>Mistakes,</hi> and to <hi>prevent</hi> your own.</p>
               <p>First then, you are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, you live in a time which hath rendred some kind of Frailties so habitual, that they lay claim to large <hi>Grains</hi> of <hi>Allowance.</hi> The World in this is somewhat unequal, and our Sex seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to play the <hi>Tyrant,</hi> in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing <hi>partiality</hi> for our selves, by making that in the utmost degree <hi>Criminal</hi> in the <hi>Woman,</hi> which in a <hi>Man</hi> passeth under a much <hi>gentler Censure.</hi> The Root
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43557:21"/>
and Excuse of this Injustice is the <hi>Preservation</hi> of Families from any Mixture that may bring a Blemish to them: And whilst the <hi>Point</hi> of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> continues to be so plac'd, it seems unavoidable to give your <hi>Sex</hi> the greater shane of the Penalty. But if in this it lieth under any <hi>Disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,</hi> you are more than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compens'd, by having the <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>Families</hi> in your keeping. The Consideration so great a Trust must give you, maketh full amends; and this Power the World hath lodg'd in you, can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fail to restrain the Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of an <hi>ill</hi> Husband, and to improve the Kindness and Esteem of a <hi>good</hi> one. This
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43557:21"/>
being so, remember, That next to the danger of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting</hi> the Fault your self, the greatest is that of <hi>seeing</hi> it in your <hi>Husband.</hi> Do not seem to look or hear that way: If he is a Man of Sense, he will reclaim him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; the Folly of it, is of it self sufficient to cure him: If he is not so, he will be provok'd, but not reform'd. To expostulate in these Cases, looketh like declaring War, and preparing for Reprisals; which to a <hi>thinking Husband</hi> would be a dangerous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion. Besides, it is so course a Reason which will be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd for a Lady's too great Warmth upon such an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that Modesty no less than
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43557:22"/>
Prudence ought to restrain her; since such an undecent Complaint makes a Wife much more ridiculous, than the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury that provoketh her to it. But it is yet worse, and more unskilful, to <hi>blaze</hi> it in the World, expecting it should rise up in Arms to take her part: Whereas she will find, it can have no other Effect, than that she will be served up in all Companies, as the <hi>reigning Feast</hi> at that time; and will continue to be the common Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till she is rescu'd by some <hi>newer Folly</hi> that cometh upon the Stage, and driveth her away from it. The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence of such Methods is so plain, that it doth not
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43557:22"/>
deserve the Pains of being laid open. Be assur'd, that in these Cases your <hi>Discretion</hi> and <hi>Silence</hi> will be the most <hi>prevailing Reproof</hi>; and an <hi>affected Ignorance,</hi> which is sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom a <hi>Vertue,</hi> is a great one here: And when your <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> seeth how unwilling you are to be uneasie, there is no stronger Argument to perswade him not to be unjust to you. Besides, it will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally make him more <hi>yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in other things: And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be to <hi>cover</hi> or <hi>redeem</hi> his <hi>Offence,</hi> you may have the good Effect of it whilst it lasteth, and all that while have the most reasonable Ground that can be, of presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, such a Behaviour at
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43557:23"/>
last will intirely convert him. There is nothing so glorious to a <hi>Wife,</hi> as a Victory so gain'd: <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Man so reclaim'd, is for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after subjected to her <hi>Vertue</hi>; and her <hi>bearing</hi> for a time, is more than rewarded by a Triumph that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as long as her Life.</p>
               <p>The next thing I will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, is, That your <hi>Husband</hi> may love <hi>Wine</hi> more than is convenient. It will be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That though there are Vices of a deeper dye, there are none that have greater <hi>Deformity</hi> than this, when it is not restrain'd: But with all this, the same Custom which is the more to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented for its being so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, should make it less un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43557:23"/>
to every one in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar who is to suffer by the Effects of it: So that in the first place, it will be no new thing if you should have a <hi>Drunkard</hi> for your <hi>Husband</hi>; and there is by too frequent Examples evidence enough, that such a thing may happen, and yet a <hi>Wife</hi> may live too without being miserable. <hi>Self-love</hi> dictateth aggravating words to every thing we feel; <hi>Ruine</hi> and <hi>Misery</hi> are the Terms we apply to whatever we do not like, forgetting the Mixture allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us by the Condition of Humane Life, by which it is not intended we should be quite exempt from trouble. It is fair, if we can escape
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43557:24"/>
such a Degree of it as would oppress us, and enjoy so much of the pleasant part as may lessen the ill taste of such things as are unwelcome to us. Every thing hath two Sides, and for our own ease we ought to direct our Thoughts to that which must be least liable to exception. To fall upon the <hi>worst side</hi> of a <hi>Drunkard,</hi> giveth so unpleasant a Prospect, that it is not possible to dwell upon it. Let us pass then to the more <hi>favourable part,</hi> as far as a <hi>Wife</hi> is concern'd in it. I am tempted to say (if the Irregularity of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression could in strictness be justified) That a <hi>Wife</hi> is to thank God her <hi>Husband</hi> hath
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43557:24"/>
                  <hi>Faults.</hi> Mark the seeming Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox, my Dear, for your own Instruction, it being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no further. A <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> without <hi>Faults</hi> is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Observer; he hath an Eye so piercing, and seeth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing so plain, that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to his full Censure; and though I will not doubt but that your <hi>Vertue</hi> will disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the sharpest Enquiries; yet few Women can bear the having all they say or do <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented</hi> in the clear Glass of an Understanding without <hi>Faults.</hi> Nothing softneth the <hi>Arrogance</hi> of our <hi>Nature,</hi> like a Mixture of some <hi>Frailties</hi>; it is by them we are best told, that we must not strike too hard upon others, because we
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43557:25"/>
our selves do so often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Blows: They pull our Rage by the Sleeve, and whisper Gentleness to us in our Censures, even when they are rightly applied. The <hi>Faults</hi> and <hi>Passions</hi> of <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands</hi> bring them down to you, and make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to live upon less une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Terms, than Faultless Men would be willing to stoop to; so haughty is Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind till humbled by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Weaknesses and Defects, which in our corrupted State contribute more towards the reconciling us to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than all the <hi>Precepts</hi> of the <hi>Philosophers</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi>; so that where the <hi>Errors</hi> of our <hi>Nature</hi> make
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43557:25"/>
amends for the <hi>Disadvantages</hi> of yours, it is more your part to make use of the <hi>Benefits,</hi> than to quarrel at the <hi>Fault.</hi>

               <p>Thus in case a <hi>drunken Husband</hi> should fall to your share, if you will be <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>patient,</hi> his <hi>Wine</hi> shall be of your side; it will throw a <hi>Veil</hi> over your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes, it will set out and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove every thing you do, that he is pleased with. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will like him less, and by that means he may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps like you the more, when after having dined too well, he is received at home without a <hi>Storm,</hi> or so much as a <hi>reproachful Look,</hi> the <hi>Wine</hi> will naturally work out all in Kindness, which
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43557:26"/>
a <hi>Wife</hi> must encourage, let it be wrapped up in never so much Impertinence: On the other side, it would boil up into <hi>Rage,</hi> if the mistaken <hi>Wife</hi> should treat him rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, like a certain thing called a <hi>kind Shrew,</hi> than which the World, with all its Plenty, cannot shew a more Senceless, Hl-bred, forbidding Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Consider, that where the Man will give such fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Intermissions of the use of his <hi>Reason,</hi> the <hi>Wife</hi> insensibly getteth a Right of <hi>Governing</hi> in the Vacancy, and that raiseth her <hi>Character</hi> and <hi>Credit</hi> in the Family, to a higher pitch than perhaps could be done under a <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Husband,</hi> who never put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43557:26"/>
himself into an Incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of holding the <hi>Reins.</hi> If these are not Intire <hi>Consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> at least they are <hi>Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> to some Degree: They cannot make <hi>Drunkenness</hi> a <hi>Vertue,</hi> nor a <hi>Husband</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to it a <hi>Felicity</hi>; but you will do your self no ill of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the endeavouring, by these means, to make the best of such a <hi>Lot,</hi> in case it should happen to be yours, and by the help of a wife Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to make that very suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, which would otherwise be a <hi>Load</hi> that would oppress you.</p>
               <p>The next Case I will put is, That your <hi>Husband</hi> may be <hi>Cholerick</hi> or <hi>Ill-humour'd.</hi> To this it may be said, That
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43557:27"/>
                  <hi>passionate Men</hi> generally make amends at the Foot of the Account: such a Man, if he is angry one day without any <hi>Sense,</hi> will the next day be as kind without any <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>; so that by marking how the <hi>Wheels</hi> of such a Mans Head use to move, you may easily bring over all his <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> to your Party; in stead of being struck down by his Thunder, you shall direct it where and upon whom you shall think it best ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. Thus are the <hi>strongest Poisons</hi> turn'd to the <hi>best Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies</hi>; but then there must be <hi>Art</hi> in it, and a <hi>skilful Hand,</hi> else the least <hi>bungling</hi> maketh it mortal. There is a great deal of nice Care re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43557:27"/>
to deal with a Man of this Complexion; <hi>Choler</hi> proceedeth from <hi>Pride,</hi> and maketh a Man so partial to himself, that he swelleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Contradiction, and thinketh he is lessened if he is opposed; you must in this Case take heed of <hi>increasing the Storm</hi> by an <hi>unwary Word,</hi> or <hi>kindling the Fire</hi> whilst the Wind is in a Corner which may blow it in your Face: You are dextrously to yield every thing till he beginneth to cool, and then by slow degrees you may rise and gain upon him: Your <hi>Gentleness</hi> well timed, will, like a Charm, dispel his Anger ill placed; a <hi>kind Smile</hi> will <hi>reclaim,</hi> when a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43557:28"/>
                  <hi>shrill pettish Answer</hi> would <hi>provoke</hi> him; rather than fail upon such occasions, when other <hi>Remedies</hi> are too weak, a little <hi>Flattery</hi> may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which by being necessary, will cease to be Criminal: If <hi>Ill-Humour</hi> and <hi>Sullenness,</hi> and not open and sudden Heat is his Disease, there is a way of treating that too, so as to make it a Grievance to be endured: In order to it, you are first to know, that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <hi>good Sence</hi> hath a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>surly</hi> in't; and there being so much folly in the World, and for the most part so triumphant, it giveth fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Temptations to raise the Spleen of Men who think right; therefore that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43557:28"/>
which may generally be call'd <hi>Ill Humour,</hi> is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a Fault; it becometh one, when either it is wrong applyed, or that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued too long, when it is not so: For this Reason, you must not too hastily fix an ill name upon that which may perhaps not deserve it; and though the Case should be, that your <hi>Husband</hi> might too sowrly resent any thing he disliketh, it may so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that more Blame may belong to your <hi>Mistake,</hi> than to his <hi>ill Humour.</hi> If a <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> behaveth himself some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with an <hi>Indifference</hi> that a <hi>Wife</hi> may think offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, she is in the wrong to put the <hi>worst sense</hi> upon it,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43557:29"/>
if by any means it will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a <hi>better.</hi> Some <hi>Wives</hi> will call it his <hi>Humour,</hi> if their Husbands <hi>change</hi> their <hi>Style</hi> from that which they used whilst they made their first Addresses to them: Others will allow no <hi>intermission</hi> or <hi>abatement</hi> in the Expressions of Kindness to them, not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough distinguishing Times, and forgetting that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for Men to keep themselves up all their Lives to the height of some <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Moments.</hi> A Man may at some times be <hi>less careful</hi> in little things, without any cold or disobliging Reasons for it; as a <hi>Wife</hi> may be <hi>too expecting</hi> in smaller matters, without drawing upon her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43557:29"/>
the Inference of being <hi>unkind</hi>: And if your <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> should be really <hi>sullen,</hi> and have such frequent Fits, as might take away the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse of it, it concerneth you to have an Eye prepared to discern the first Appearances of Cloudy Weather, and to watch when the Fit goeth off, which seldom lasteth long if it is let alone; but whilst the Mind is sore, every thing galleth it, and that maketh it necessary to let the <hi>Black Humour</hi> begin to spend it self, before you begin to come in and venture to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it.</p>
               <p>If in the Lottery of the World you should draw a <hi>Covetous Husband,</hi> I confess it
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43557:30"/>
will not make you proud of your good Luck; yet even such a one may be endured too, though there are few Passions more untractable than that of <hi>Avarice.</hi> You must first take care that your <hi>Definition</hi> of <hi>Avarice</hi> may not be a Mistake; you are to examine every Circumstance of your <hi>Husband</hi>'s Fortune, and weigh the Reason of every thing you expect from him before you have right to pronounce that Sentence: The Complaint is now so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally against all <hi>Husbands,</hi> that it giveth great suspicion of its being often ill-groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; it is impossible they should all deserve that Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and therefore it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43557:30"/>
that it is many times misapplyed: he that <hi>spareth</hi> in every thing is an <hi>inexcusable Niggard,</hi> he that <hi>spareth</hi> in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is as <hi>inexcusable a Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>; the <hi>mean</hi> is, to spare in what is least necessary, to lay out more liberally in what is most required in our several citcumstances; yet this will not always satisfie; there are <hi>Wives</hi> who are impatient of the Rules of Oeconomy, and are apt to call their <hi>Husbands</hi> Kindness in question, if any other measure is put to their expence than that of their own Fancy; be sure to avoid this dangerous Errour, such a partiality to your Self, which is so offensive to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding Man, that he will
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43557:31"/>
very ill bear a <hi>Wife's</hi> giving her self such an injurious <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> to all the <hi>Family,</hi> and whatever belongeth to it: But to admit the worst, and that your <hi>Husband</hi> is really a <hi>Close-handed Wretch,</hi> you must in this, as in other Cases, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make it less afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you; and first you must observe <hi>seasonable hours</hi> of speaking.</p>
               <p>When you offer any thing in opposition to this reigning Humour, a <hi>third hand</hi> and a <hi>wise Friend,</hi> may often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail more than you will be allowed to do in your own Cause: Sometimes you are dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trously to go along with him in things, where you see that the niggardly part of his Mind
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43557:31"/>
is most predominant, by which you will have the better op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of perswading him in things where he may be more indifferent: Our <hi>Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> are very unequal, and are apt to be raised or lessened, according as they work upon different Objects; they are not to be <hi>stopped</hi> or <hi>restrained</hi> in those things where our Mind is more particularly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged: In other matters they are more tractable, and will sometimes give Reason a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and admit a fair Dispute. More than that, there are few Men, even in this instance of <hi>Avarice,</hi> so intirely abandoned to it, that at some hours, and upon some occasions, will not forget their natures, and for
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43557:32"/>
that time turn Prodigal; the same Man who will <hi>grudge</hi> himself what is <hi>necessary,</hi> let his <hi>Pride</hi> be raised and he shall be <hi>profuse</hi>; at another time his <hi>Anger</hi> shall have the same effect; a fit of <hi>Vanity, Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and sometimes of <hi>Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> shall open and inlarge his <hi>narrow Mind</hi>; a Dose of Wine will work upon this tough humour, and for the time dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve it: Your business must be, if this Case happeneth, to watch these <hi>critical moments,</hi> and not let one of them slip without making your advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it; and a <hi>Wife</hi> may be said to want skill, if by these means she is not able to secure her self in a good measure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Inconveniencies this
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43557:32"/>
scurvy quality in a <hi>Husband</hi> might bring upon her, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he should be such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable Monster, as I hope will never fall to your share.</p>
               <p>The last supposition I will make, is, That your <hi>Husband</hi> should be <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> to make use of the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges that belong to him; it will be yielded, that such a one leaveth room for a great many Objections; but God Almighty seldom sendeth a <hi>Grievance</hi> without a <hi>Remedy,</hi> or at least such a Mitigation as taketh away a great part of the sting, and smart of it. To make such a <hi>Misfortune</hi> less heavy, you are first to bring to your Observation, That a
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43557:33"/>
                  <hi>Wife</hi> very often maketh the better Figure, for her <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands</hi> making no great one, and there seemeth to be little reason, why the same <hi>Lady</hi> that chuseth a <hi>Waiting-Woman</hi> with <hi>worse Looks,</hi> many not be content with a <hi>Husband</hi> with <hi>less Wit</hi>; the Argument being equal from the advantage of the Comparison: If you will be more ashamed in some Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, of such a <hi>Husband,</hi> you will be less afraid than you would perhaps be of a wise one; his <hi>Unseasonable Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> may no doubt sometimes grieve you, but then set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this, that it giveth you the <hi>Dominion,</hi> if you will make the right use of it; it is next to his being dead, in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43557:33"/>
which Case the <hi>Wife</hi> hath right to Administer; therefore be sure, if you have such an Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot, that none, except your self, may have the benefit of the forfeiture: Such a Fool is a dangerous Beast, if others have the keeping of him; and you must be very undextrous if when your <hi>Husband</hi> shall resolve to be an <hi>Ass,</hi> you do not take care he may be <hi>your Ass</hi>; but you must go skill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully about it, and above all things, take heed of distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing in publick what kind of <hi>Husband</hi> he is; your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thoughts must not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the outward payment of the consideration that is due to him; your <hi>stighting</hi> him in <hi>Company,</hi> besides that, it
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43557:34"/>
would, to a discerning By-stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, give too great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the making near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er application to you, is in it self such an undecent way of assuming, that it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the tame Creature to break loose, and to shew his <hi>Dominion</hi> for his Credit, which he was content to forget for his Ease: In short, the furest and the most approved me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod will be to do like a wife <hi>Minister</hi> to an easie <hi>Prince</hi>; first give him the Orders you afterwards receive from him; with all this, that which you are to pray for, is a <hi>Wife Husband,</hi> one that by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to be a <hi>Master,</hi> for that very reason will not let you feel the weight of it; one
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43557:34"/>
whose Authority is so soften'd by his Kindness, that it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth you ease without abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your <hi>Liberty</hi>; one that will return so much tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for <hi>Iust Esteem</hi> of him, that you will never want <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> though you will seldom care to use it; such a <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> is as much above all the other Kinds of them, as a <hi>rational subjection</hi> to a Prince, great in himself, is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd before the disquiet and uneasiness of <hi>Unlimited Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I leave this Head, I must add a little concerning your <hi>Behaviour</hi> to your <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Friends,</hi> which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the most refined part of your Understanding to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43557:35"/>
your self well of it; you are to study how to live with them with more care than you are to apply to any other part of your Life; especially at first, that you may not stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the first setting out; the <hi>Family</hi> into which you are grafted will generally be apt to expect, that like a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in a Foreign Country, you should conform to their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, and not bring in a new Model by your own Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the <hi>Friends</hi> in such a Case are tempted to rise up in Arms as against an unlawful Invasion, so that you are with the utmost Caution to avoid the least Appearances of any thing of this kind; and that you may with less diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43557:35"/>
afterwards give your Directions, be sure at first to receive them from your <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands</hi> Friends, gain them to you by early applying to them, and they will be so sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that as nothing is more thankful than Pride, when it is complyed with, they will strive which of them shall most recommend you; and when they have helped you to take Root in your <hi>Husband</hi>'s good Opinion, you will have less dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theirs, though you must not neglect any reasonable means of preserving it.</p>
               <p>You are to consider, that a Man govern'd by his <hi>Friends,</hi> is very easily inflamed by them; and that one who is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43557:36"/>
not so, will yet for his own sake expect to have them consider'd. It is easily impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to a point of honour in a <hi>Husband,</hi> not to have his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> neglected; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more dangerous, than to raise an Objection, which is grounded upon <hi>Pride</hi>; it is the most stubborn and lasting Passion we are subject to, and when it is the first cause of the <hi>War,</hi> it is very hard to make a secure <hi>Peace</hi>: your <hi>Caution</hi> in this is of the last importance to you; and that you may the better succeed in it, carry a strict Eye upon the <hi>Impertinencies</hi> of your <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi>; take heed that their ill <hi>humour</hi> may not engage you to take Exceptions, or their
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43557:36"/>
too much assuming in small matters, raise Consequences which may bring you under great disadvantage.</p>
               <p>Remember that in the case of a <hi>Royal Bride,</hi> those about her are generally so far su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected to bring in a Foreign Interest, that in most Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, they are insensibly redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a very small number, and those of so low a Figure, that it doth not admit the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jealous</hi> of them. In little, and in the Proportion, this may be the Case of every <hi>New-Married-Woman,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may be more advise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for you, to <hi>gain the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> you find in a Family, than to tye your self too fast to those you carry into it; you
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43557:37"/>
are not to overlook those small Reflections, because they may appear low and inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable; for it may be said, that as the <hi>greatest streams</hi> are made up of the <hi>small drops</hi> at the head of the Springs from whence they are derived, so the <hi>greatest circumstances</hi> of your Life, will be in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree directed by these <hi>seeming trifles,</hi> which having the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of being the first acts of it, have a greater effect than singly in their own nature they could pretend to.</p>
               <p>I will conclude this Article with my Advice, that you would, as much as Nature will give you leave, endeavour to forget the great <hi>Indulgence</hi> you have found at home, after
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43557:37"/>
such a gentle Discipline as you have been under; every thing you dislike will seem the harsher to you, the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness we had for you, <hi>My Dear,</hi> is of another nature, peculiar to kind Parents, and differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from that you will meet with at first in any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily into which you shall be transplanted; and yet they may be very kind too, and afford no justifiable reason to you to complain. You must not be frighted with the first Appearances of a <hi>differing Scene</hi>; for when you are used to it, you may like the House you go to, better than that you left; and your <hi>Husband's</hi> Kindness will have so much advantage of ours, that we
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43557:38"/>
shall yield up all <hi>Competition,</hi> and as well as we love you, be very well contented to Surrender to such a <hi>Rival.</hi>

               <p>YOU must lay before you, <hi>My Dear,</hi> there are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Care to recommend your self to the World in the several parts of your Life, in many things, though the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them well, may raise your <hi>Credit</hi> and <hi>Esteem,</hi> yet the omission of them would draw no immediate reproach upon you; in others, where your duty is more particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, the <hi>neglect</hi> of them is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those Faults which are
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43557:38"/>
not forgiven, and will bring you under a <hi>Censure,</hi> which will be much a heavier thing than the trouble you would avoid; of this kind is the <hi>Government</hi> of your <hi>House, Family</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> which since it is the Province allotted to your Sex, and that the <hi>discharging it well,</hi> will for that reason be expected from you, if you ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther desert it out of <hi>Laziness,</hi> or manage it with <hi>want of skill,</hi> instead of a <hi>help</hi> you will be an <hi>Incumbrance</hi> to the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily</hi> where you are placed.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43557:39"/>
go along with it, and fly to others where something may be expected in exchange for them; and upon this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple the <hi>respects</hi> even of the <hi>Children</hi> and the <hi>Servants</hi> will not stay with one that doth not think them worth their Care, and the old <hi>House-keeper</hi> shall make a better Figure in the Family, than the <hi>Lady</hi> with all her fine Cloths, if she wilfully relinquish her Title to the <hi>Government</hi>; therefore take heed of carrying your <hi>good Breeding</hi> to such a height, as to be good for nothing, and to be proud of it: some think it hath a great Air to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove troubling their thoughts with such ordinary things as their <hi>House</hi> and <hi>Family</hi>; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

will not do, they are not such a lasting <hi>Tenure,</hi> as to be relyed upon; and if they should stay longer than they usually do, it will by no means be safe to depend upon them; for when time hath abated the violence of the first liking, and that the <hi>Napp</hi> is a little worn off, though still a good degree of kindness may remain, Men recover their sight which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might be dazell'd, and allow themselves to object as well as admire; in such a Case, when a <hi>Husband</hi> seeth an empty airy thing that sails up and down the House to no purpose, and looks as if she came thither only to make a Visit, when he find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,

that after her <hi>Emptiness</hi> hath been extream busy about some very senseless thing, that she eats her Breakfast half an hour before Dinner, to be at greater liberty to afflict the Company with her Discourse; then calleth for her Coach, that she may trouble her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, who are already cloy'd with her: And having some <hi>proper Dialogues</hi> ready to display her <hi>Foolish Eloquence</hi> at the top of the Stairs, she setteth out like a Ship out of Harbour, laden with trifles, and cometh back with them; at her return she repeateth to her faithful Waiting-Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the <hi>Triumphs</hi> of that day's <hi>Impertinence,</hi> then wrap'd up in Flattery and clean Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,

               <p>To the <hi>Men</hi> you are to have a <hi>Behaviour</hi> which may secure you, without offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them: No ill-bred affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43557:55"/>
                  <hi>Shiness</hi> nor <hi>Roughness,</hi> unsuitable to your <hi>Sex,</hi> and unnecessary to your <hi>Vertue</hi>; but a way of Living that may prevent all course <hi>Railleries</hi> or <hi>unmannerly Freedoms; Looks</hi> that forbid without <hi>Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and oblige without <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation,</hi> or leaving room for the sawcy Inferences Mens Vanity suggesteth to them upon the least Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This is so very nice, that it must engage you to have a perpetual <hi>Watch</hi> upon your <hi>Eyes,</hi> and to remember, that one careless <hi>Glaunce</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth more advantage than a <hi>hundred Words</hi> not enough considered; the <hi>Language</hi> of the <hi>Eyes</hi> being very much the most <hi>significant,</hi> and the most
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43557:56"/>
                  <hi>observed.</hi> Your <hi>Civility,</hi> which is always to be preserved, must not be carried to a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance,</hi> which may betray you into irrecoverable Mistakes. This <hi>French</hi> ambiguous word <hi>Complaisance</hi> hath led your Sex into more blame, than all other things put together: It carrieth them by degrees into a certain thing called a <hi>good kind</hi> of <hi>Woman,</hi> an easie <hi>Idle Creature,</hi> that doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Good</hi> nor <hi>Ill</hi> but by <hi>chance,</hi> hath no <hi>Choice,</hi> but leaveth that to the Company she keepeth. <hi>Time,</hi> which by degrees addeth to the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of <hi>Words,</hi> hath made her, according to Modern Stile, little better than one who thinketh it a <hi>Rudeness</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:43557:56"/>
to deny, when civilly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, either her <hi>Service in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> or her <hi>friendly Assistance,</hi> to those who would have a <hi>meeting</hi> or want a <hi>Confident.</hi> She is a certain thing always at hand, an easie <hi>Companion,</hi> who hath ever great <hi>Compassion</hi> for <hi>distressed Lovers:</hi> She cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sureth nothing but <hi>Rigour,</hi> and is never without a <hi>Plaister</hi> for a <hi>wounded Reputation,</hi> in which chiefly lieth her Skill in <hi>Chirurgery:</hi> She seldom hath the Propriety of any <hi>particular Gallant,</hi> but liveth upon <hi>Brokage,</hi> and waiteth for the Scraps her Friends are content to leave her.</p>
               <p>There is another <hi>Character</hi> not quite so <hi>Criminal,</hi> yet not less <hi>Ridiculous</hi>; which is that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43557:57"/>
of a <hi>good-humour'd Woman,</hi> one who thinketh she must always be in a <hi>Laugh,</hi> or a broad <hi>Smile</hi>; and because <hi>Good-Humour</hi> is an obliging Quality, thinketh it less ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manners to talk <hi>impertinently,</hi> than to be silent in Company. When such a prating <hi>Engine</hi> rideth <hi>Admiral,</hi> and carrieth the <hi>Lanthorn</hi> in a <hi>Circle of Fools,</hi> a <hi>cheerful Coxcomb</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in for a <hi>Recruit,</hi> the <hi>Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering</hi> of <hi>Monkeys</hi> is a better noise than such a <hi>Concert</hi> of <hi>senceless Merriment:</hi> If she is applauded in it, she is so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, that, like a <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lad singer,</hi> who, if commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, breaketh his Lungs, she letteth her self loose, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verfloweth upon the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43557:57"/>
She conceiveth that Mirth is to have no Intermission, and therefore she will carry it about with her, though it be to a <hi>Funeral</hi>; and if a Man should put a familiar Question, she doth not know very well how to be angry, for then she would be no more that pretty thing called a <hi>Good humour'd Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> This necessity of appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at all times to be infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleased, is a grievous mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake; since in a <hi>handsom Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> that <hi>Invitation</hi> is unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary; and in one who is not so, <hi>ridiculous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not intended by this, that you should forswear <hi>Laughing</hi>; but remember, that Fools being always painted
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43557:58"/>
in that posture it may fright those who are wise from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it too frequently, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too near a Copy which is so little inviting, and much more from doing it <hi>loud,</hi> which is an unnatural Sound, and looketh so much like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sex, that few things are more offensive. That <hi>boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous</hi> kind of <hi>Follity</hi> is as contrary to <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Good manners,</hi> as it is to <hi>Modesty</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi>; besides, it is a course kind of quality, that throweth a Woman into a lower Form, and degradeth her from the Rank of those who are more refined. Some <hi>Ladies</hi> speak <hi>aloud</hi> and make a <hi>noise</hi> to be the more mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which looketh as if they
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43557:58"/>
beat their <hi>Drums</hi> for <hi>Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,</hi> and if by misfortune none come in to them, they may, not without reason, be a good deal out of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p>There is yet one thing more to be avoided, which is the <hi>Example</hi> of those who intend nothing farther than the Vanity of <hi>Conquest,</hi> and think themselves secure of not having their Honour tainted by it. Some are apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their <hi>Vertue</hi> is too <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,</hi> and not <hi>enough known,</hi> except it is exposed to a <hi>broader Light,</hi> and set out to its best advantage, by some publick Trials; these are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Experiments, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally fail, being built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43557:59"/>
so weak a foundation, as that of too great <hi>Confidence</hi> in our selves; it is as safe to play with <hi>Fire,</hi> as to dally with <hi>Gallantry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Love</hi> is a Passion that hath Friends in the Garrison, and for that reason must by a Woman be kept at such a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, that she may not be within the danger of doing the most usual thing in the World, which is conspiring against her Self, else the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Gallant, who is only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as a Trophy, very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten becometh the Conquerour; he putteth on the style of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and from an <hi>Admirer</hi> groweth into a <hi>Master,</hi> for so he may be called from the moment he is in Possession.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43557:59"/>
The first Resolutions of stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at good Opinion and Esteem, grow weaker by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees against the Charms of <hi>Courtship</hi> skillfully applyed. A Lady is apt to think a Man speaketh so much reason whilst he is <hi>Commending</hi> her, that she hath much ado to believe him in the wrong when he is making Love to her, and when besides the natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements your Sex hath to be merciful, she is bribed by well-chosen <hi>Flattery,</hi> the poor Creature is in danger of being caught like a Bird listening to the Whistle of one that hath a Snare for it. <hi>Conquest</hi> is so tempting a thing, that it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten maketh Women mistake Mens <hi>Submissions</hi>; which with
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43557:60"/>
all their fair Appearances, have generally less <hi>Respect</hi> than <hi>Art</hi> in them. You are to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that Men who say ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream fine things, many times say them most for their own sakes, and that the vain Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant is often as well pleased with his own <hi>Compliments,</hi> as he could be with the <hi>kindest answer</hi>; where there is not that <hi>Ostentation</hi> you are to suspect there is a <hi>Design</hi>; and as strong <hi>perfumes</hi> are seldom used but when they are necessary to smother an unwelcome <hi>scent</hi>; so <hi>Excess</hi> of <hi>good Words,</hi> leave room to believe they are strewed to cover something which is to gain admittance under a Disguise: You must be therefore upon your Guard,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:43557:60"/>
and consider, that of the two, <hi>Respect</hi> is more dangerous than <hi>Anger,</hi> it puts even the best Understandings out of their place, till the time of their second thoughts restore them; it stealeth upon us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly, throweth down our <hi>Defences,</hi> and maketh it too late to resist, after we have given it that advantage, whereas railing goeth away in sound, it hath so much noise in it, that by giving warning it bespeaketh Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Respect</hi> is a flow and sure <hi>Poison,</hi> and like <hi>Poison</hi> swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us within our selves, where it prevaileth too much, it groweth to be a kind of <hi>Apoplexia</hi> in the Mind, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it quite round, and after
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43557:61"/>
it hath once seized the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, becometh <hi>mortal</hi> to it: For these reasons, the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest way is to treat it like a fly Enemy, and be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon the watch against it.</p>
               <p>I will add one <hi>Advice</hi> to conclude this head, which is, that you will let every seven years make some alteration in you towards the <hi>Graves</hi> side, and not be like the <hi>Girls</hi> of Fifty, who resolve to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>Young,</hi> what ever <hi>Time</hi> with his Iron Teeth hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to the contrary; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural things carry a <hi>Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> in them never to the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised</hi>; the <hi>Liveliness</hi> of <hi>Youth</hi> in a riper Age, looketh like an <hi>old patch</hi> upon a <hi>new Gown</hi>;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:43557:61"/>
so that a <hi>Gay Matron,</hi> a chearful <hi>old Fool</hi> may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably put into the List of the <hi>Tamer</hi> kind of <hi>Monsters:</hi> There is a certain Creature call'd a <hi>Grave Hobby-Horse,</hi> a kind of she <hi>Numps,</hi> that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to be pulled to a Play, and must needs go to <hi>Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomew-Fair,</hi> to look after the young Folks, of whom she onely seemeth to take care, when in reality she onely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them for her excuse; such an old <hi>Butterfly</hi> is of all <hi>Creatures</hi> the most ridiculous, and the soonest found out. It is good to be early in your Caution, to avoid any thing that cometh within distance of such despicable Patterns, and not like some <hi>Ladies,</hi> who
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:43557:62"/>
defer their <hi>Conversion,</hi> till they have been so long in possession of being laughed at, that the World doth not know how to change their style, even when they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed from that which gave the first occasion for it; the advantages of being <hi>reserved</hi> are too many to be set down, I will only say, that it is a <hi>Guard</hi> to a <hi>good Woman,</hi> and a <hi>Disguise</hi> to an <hi>ill one.</hi> It is of so much use to both, that those ought to use it as an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice,</hi> who refuse to practise it as a <hi>Vertue.</hi>

               <p>Do not lay out your <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> too <hi>lavishly</hi> at first, since it will, like other things, be so much the sooner spent; neither let it be of too quick a <hi>growth</hi>; for as the Plants which shoot up too <hi>fast</hi> are not of that <hi>continuance,</hi> as

those which take more time for it; so too swift a Progress in pouring out your <hi>Kindness,</hi> is a certain Sign that by the Course of Nature it will not be <hi>long-lived.</hi> You will be responsible to the World, if you pitch upon such <hi>Friends</hi> as at the same time are under the weight of any <hi>Criminal Objection</hi>; in that case you will bring your self under the disadvantages of their <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi> and must bear your part of it. <hi>Chusing</hi> implieth <hi>Approving</hi>; and if you fix upon a <hi>Lady</hi> for your <hi>Friend</hi> against whom the World shall have given Judgment, 'tis not so well natur'd as to believe you are altogether <hi>averse</hi> to her way of <hi>living,</hi>

since it doth not discourage you from admitting her into your <hi>Kindness</hi>; and <hi>Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance</hi> of <hi>Inclinations</hi> being thought none of the least Inducements to <hi>Friendship,</hi> you will be looked upon at least as a well-wisher if not a <hi>Partner</hi> with her in her Faults: If you can forgive them in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, it may be presumed you will not be less gentle to your self; and therefore you must not take it ill, if you are rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned a <hi>Croupiere,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to pay an equal Share with such a friend of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi> she hath lost.</p>

you may be slow in your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in the beginning of the Discovery; but as soon as you are convinced by a <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Evidence,</hi> you must, without breaking too <hi>rughly,</hi> make a fair and quick <hi>Retreat</hi> from such a <hi>Mistaken Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>; else by moving <hi>too slowly</hi> from one that is so tainted, the Contagion may reach you so far as to give you part of the <hi>Scandal,</hi> though not of the <hi>Guilt.</hi> This Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is so nice, that as you must not be too hasty to <hi>joyn</hi> in the <hi>Censure</hi> upon your <hi>Friend</hi> when she is <hi>accused,</hi> so you are not on the other side to <hi>defend</hi> her with too much warmth; for if she should happen to deserve the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port

very ridiculous. Her <hi>good Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi> is generally applied to the laughing at <hi>good Sence.</hi> It would do one good to see how heartily she despiseth any thing that is fit for her to do.

to improve her <hi>Character,</hi> it is then raised to the highest <hi>Perfection.</hi> She first setteth up for a <hi>Fine thing,</hi> and for that Reason will distinguish her self, right or wrong, in every thing she doth. She would have it thought that she is made of so much the <hi>finer Clay,</hi> and so much more <hi>sifted</hi> than ordinary, that she hath no <hi>common Earth</hi> about her: to this end she must neither move nor speak like other Women, because it would be <hi>vulgar</hi>; and therefore must have a Language of her <hi>own,</hi> since <hi>ordinary English</hi> is too course for her.

Lovers,</hi> and <hi>Ladies</hi> that are <hi>merciful.</hi> She will repeat the tender part of a <hi>Play</hi> so feelingly, that the Company may guess, without Injustice, she was not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>disinteressed Spectator.</hi> She thinketh that <hi>Paint</hi> and <hi>Sin</hi> are concealed by rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at them; upon the latter she is less hard, and being divided between the two op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite Prides of her <hi>Beauty</hi> and her <hi>Vertue,</hi> she is often tempted to give broad Hints that some body is dying for her; and of the two she is less unwilling to let the World think she may be sometimes profan'd, than that she is never worshipped.

               <p>AFter having said this against <hi>Vanity,</hi> I do not intend to apply the same <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> to <hi>Pride,</hi> well placed, and rightly defined. It is an <hi>ambiguous Word</hi>; one kind of it is as much a <hi>Vertue,</hi> as the other is a <hi>Vice</hi>: But we are naturally so apt to chuse the <hi>worst,</hi> that it is become dangerous to commend the <hi>best</hi> side of it. A Woman is not to be proud of her fine Gown; nor when she hath less Wit than her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, to comfort her self
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:43557:78"/>
that she hath more Lace. Some Ladies put so much weight upon <hi>Ornaments,</hi> that if one could see into their Hearts, it would be found, that even the Thoughts of <hi>Death</hi> are made less heavy to them by the Contemplation of their being <hi>laid out</hi> in <hi>State,</hi> and <hi>honourably attended</hi> to the <hi>Grave.</hi> One may come a good deal short of such an <hi>Extream,</hi> and yet still be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently <hi>Impertinent,</hi> by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a wrong Value upon things which ought to be used with more indifference. A Lady must not appear sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to ingross <hi>Respect</hi> to her self, but be content with a reasonable <hi>Distribution,</hi> and allow it to others, that she
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:43557:79"/>
may have it returned to her. She is not to be troublesomly <hi>nice,</hi> nor distinguish her self by being too <hi>delicate,</hi> as if or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary things were too <hi>course</hi> for her; this is an <hi>unmanner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>offensive</hi> Pride, and where it is practised, deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to be mortified, of which it seldom faileth. She is not to lean too much upon her Quality, much less to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite those who are below it. Some make <hi>Quality</hi> an <hi>Idol,</hi> and then their <hi>Reason</hi> must fall down and worship it; they would have the World think, that no amends can ever be made for the want of a <hi>great Title,</hi> or ancient <hi>Coat of Arms</hi>: They imagine, that with these <hi>Advantages</hi> they
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:43557:79"/>
stand upon the <hi>higher Ground,</hi> which maketh them look down upon <hi>Merit</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> as things inferiour to them. This Mistake is not only <hi>senseless,</hi> but <hi>criminal</hi> too, in putting a greater Price upon that which is a piece of <hi>good Luck,</hi> than upon things which are valuable in themselves. <hi>Laughing</hi> is not enough for such a <hi>Folly</hi>; it must be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely <hi>whipped,</hi> as it justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves. It will be confessed, there are frequent <hi>Temptations</hi> given by <hi>pert Upstarts</hi> to be angry, and by that to have our Judgment corrupted in these Cases; but they are to be resisted, and the utmost that is to be allowed, is, when those of a <hi>new Edition</hi> will
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:43557:80"/>
forget themselves, so as either to brag of their <hi>weak side,</hi> or to endeavour to hide their <hi>Meanness</hi> by their <hi>Insolence</hi>; to cure them by a little sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable <hi>Raillery,</hi> a little <hi>Sharpness</hi> well placed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dwelling too long upon it. These and many other kinds of <hi>Pride</hi> are to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided. That which is to be recommended to you, is, an <hi>Emulation</hi> to raise your self to a <hi>Character,</hi> by which you may be distinguished, an Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerness for precedence in <hi>Vertue,</hi> and all such other things as may gain you a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter share in the good Opinion of the World. <hi>Esteem</hi> to <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> is like a <hi>cherishing Air</hi> to <hi>Plants</hi> and <hi>Flowers,</hi> which
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:43557:80"/>
maketh them blow and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and for that reason it may be allowed to be in some degree the <hi>Cause</hi> as well as the <hi>Reward</hi> of it. That <hi>Pride</hi> which leadeth to a <hi>good End,</hi> cannot be a <hi>Vice,</hi> since it is the beginning of a <hi>Vertue</hi>; and to be pleased with just <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause,</hi> is so far from being a <hi>Fault,</hi> that it would be an <hi>ill Symptom</hi> in a Woman, who should not place the greatest part of her <hi>Satisfaction</hi> in it. <hi>Humility</hi> is no doubt a great <hi>Vertue</hi>; but it ceaseth to be so, when it is afraid to scorn an <hi>ill thing.</hi> Against <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> it is becoming your <hi>Sex</hi> to be <hi>haughty</hi>; but you must not carry the <hi>Contempt</hi> of <hi>things</hi> to <hi>Arrogance</hi> towards
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:43557:81"/>
                  <hi>Persons,</hi> and it must be done with fitting <hi>Distinctions,</hi> else it may be <hi>Inconvenient</hi> by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unseasonable. A <hi>Pride</hi> that raiseth a little <hi>Anger</hi> to be out-done in any thing that is good, will have so good an <hi>Effect,</hi> that it is very hard to allow it to be a Fault. It is no easie matter to carry even between these differing kinds so described; but remember, that it is safer for a <hi>Woman</hi> to be thought too proud, than too familiar.</p>

besides, they make themselves <hi>Cheap,</hi> than which there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be an <hi>unkinder word</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon your <hi>Sex.</hi> To play sometimes, to entertain <hi>Company,</hi> or to <hi>divert</hi> your self, is not to be disallowed, but to do it so often as to be called a <hi>Gamester,</hi> is to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, next to the things that are most <hi>Criminal.</hi> It hath Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of <hi>several kinds</hi> not to be indured; it will ingage you into a habit of <hi>Idleness</hi> and <hi>ill hours,</hi> draw you into ill mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Company,</hi> make you neglect your <hi>Civilities</hi> abroad, and your <hi>business</hi> at home, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose into your <hi>Acquaintance</hi> such as will do you no Credit. To deep <hi>Play</hi> there will be yet greater <hi>Objections</hi>; it will

give <hi>Occasion</hi> to the World to ask <hi>spiteful Questions,</hi> how you dare venture to <hi>lose,</hi> and what means you have to pay such great <hi>sums.</hi> If you pay <hi>exactly,</hi> it will be enquired from whence the <hi>money</hi> cometh; if you owe, and especially to a Man, you must be so very <hi>Civil</hi> to him for his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, that it layeth a ground of having it farther improved if the <hi>Gentleman</hi> is so disposed, who will be thought no unfair <hi>Creditor,</hi> if where the <hi>Estate</hi> faileth he seizeth upon the Person; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, if a <hi>Lady</hi> could see her own Face upon an <hi>ill Game,</hi> at a deep Stake, she would certainly forswear any thing

               <p>TO <hi>Dance</hi> sometimes will not be imputed to you as a fault, but remember that the end of your <hi>Learning</hi> it, was, that you might know the better how to move <hi>grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi>; it is only an <hi>advantage</hi> so far; when it goeth beyond it, one may call it <hi>excelling</hi> in a Mistake, which is no very great Commendation: It is better for a <hi>Woman</hi> never to <hi>Dance,</hi> because she hath no skill in it, than to do it too
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:43557:85"/>
often, because she doth it well; the easiest as well as the safest <hi>Method</hi> of doing it, is in <hi>private Companies,</hi> as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst <hi>particular Friends,</hi> and then carelesly, like a <hi>Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>; rather than with <hi>Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> as if it was business, or had any thing in it to deserve a <hi>Months preparation</hi> by seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conference with a <hi>Dance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Master.</hi>

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:43557:85"/>
all that is good to you, that you may live so as to be an Ornament to your Family, and a Pattern to your Sex, that you may be blessed with a Husband that may value, and with Children that may inherit your Vertue; that you may shine in the World by a true Light, and silence Envy by deserving to be esteemed, that Wit and Vertue may both conspire to make you a great Figure; when they are separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the first is so empty, and the other so faint, that they scarce have right to be commended: May they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meet and never part; let them be your Guardian An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and be sure never to stray out of the distance of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:43557:86"/>
their joint-protection: May you so raise your Character, that you may help to make the next Age a better thing, and leave Posterity in your Debt for the advantage it shall receive by your Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Let me conjure you, <hi>My Dearest,</hi> to comply with this kind Ambition of a Father, whose thoughts are so ingaged in your behalf, that he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koneth your Happiness to be the greatest part of his own.</p>
