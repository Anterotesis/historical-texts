         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

OR,
Several Propoſals probably beneficial for
England, humbly offered to the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of all good Patriots in both
Houſes of Parliament.</head>
            <p>ALthough the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> doth
abound with many bleſſings, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nations want, yet doth it want
many which others enjoy.</p>
            <p>It is recorded, That an eminent foreign Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador,
after a long Reſidence in <hi>England,</hi>
ſayling homeward, did caſt his eye back upon
this Land, and ſaid in his own language, <hi>O
Iſola feliciſſima, &amp;c.</hi> The happyeſt Country
upon the face of the Earth, did it not want pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Spirits amongſt them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:40842:3"/>
The want of publick Spirits hath occaſioned
the want of many Publick works of Peity and
Charity, works neceſſary or commodious for
the people, or of ornament for the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>I. To ſupply this want, That (by ſuch eaſie
wayes and means as are hereafter mentioned)
there may be raiſed a publick Stock to be put
into the hands of Commiſſioners nominated
by both Houſes of Parliament, approved by the
King, and accountable to them for the ſame.</p>
            <p>II. For raiſing ſuch publick Stock, it is
propoſed firſt, That, according to the practice
of neighbour Nations, upon all ſuch Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
as occaſion either Exceſs or Luxury,
Wantonneſs, Idleneſs, Pride, or Corruption of
Manners, there may be laid a large Impoſt:
as upon all Wines, all ſtrong Drinks, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,
Coffee, Chocolatte, Sugars, Spices,
Plums, all ſorts of Sweet-meats, Oranges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Upon all Silks, Laces, Ribbons, Jewels, Feathers,
Perruques, Fringes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Upon all fine Linnens,
Camolets; upon Cards, Dice, Tables, Bouls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
upon all Coaches, Chariots, Litters, Sedans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
upon all Pictures, Perfumes, Paints for the
Face, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Moreover a third part of all the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of Comedians, Ropedancers, Mountebanks,
Lotteryes, Shewes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:40842:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
III. That (according to the practice of the
Primitive Chriſtians, whoſe Devotion was ſuch
that they thought no Teſtament well made,
unleſs ſome conſiderable portion was thereby
added to Chriſts Patrimony) that no Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
henceforth ſhould be valid unleſs a 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
part of the Legacies were given to theſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
publick and pious uſes.</p>
            <p>IV. That for theſe uſes there may be reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
(as was anciently practiſed in the Roman
State) a tenth part of the profit of all Lands
given by the Husband to the Wife, or coming
from the Wife to the Husband, there being no
Iſſue between them alive.</p>
            <p>V. That a 40<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of all things recovered
by Law may be (as once among the Romans)
aſſigned for publick usſes.</p>
            <p>VI. That there be paid out of all marriage
Portions Six pence in the Pound, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
proportionably paid at the death and
birth of every perſon not living on Almes.</p>
            <p>VII. That every one to be made free of a
Trade, or licenced to practice in Law or Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
may pay proportionably to theſe publick
uſes.</p>
            <p>VIII. That all Contracts in Writing, all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
Judgments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may have a ſmall Seal
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40842:4"/>
on the top (as is practiſed in divers other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys)
for which a ſmal Tax to be paid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IX. That in all Churches (as in <hi>Holland</hi>) at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
ſolemn Aſſembly, the Churchwardens with
a long Staff, Bag and Bell during the Sermon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the charitable benevolence of the whole
Congregation, where every perſon that desires
to honour God (not onely with his Soul and
Body, but) with his Subſtance (as God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and the primitive Chriſtians punctually
obſerved at their Church-meetings) throwing
in but his Mite, it is incredible (by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
courſe at every Aſſembly) to what a ſum
it will amount in one year.</p>
            <p>Now the Moneys of this publick ſtock may
be employed in theſe publick uſes following;</p>
            <p>X. For building Work-houſes in all conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
parts of this Kingdom, for making Rivers
navigable, for building or repairing Bridges,
Highways, Sea-banks, Havens, Moles, Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks,
Aquaeducts for ſetting up poor Youths
after an Apprentiſhip ſerved; for marrying poor
Maids, for relief of aged, impotent, decayed
People; for maintenance of ſick and maimed
Souldiers; for redemption and relief of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
and Slaves in <hi>Turky;</hi> for building and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
of Churches, whereof there is great
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40842:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
want in this Kingdom, more eſpecially in the
Suburbs of <hi>London,</hi> where not a fourth part of
the Pariſhioners can at once enter into their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
Church, at leaſt not well hear Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
to the great ſhame of the Proteſtant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,
who ſince the Reformation have (as
our Adverſaries obſerve) erected ſcarce one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
ſolid Structure for the worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>For repairing the Mother-Church of the
Mother-City of this Kingdom, to the Glory of
God and Honor of this Nation; for the ſpeedy
promoting whereof, both King and Parliament,
City and Country, Clergy and Laity, High and
Low ſtand all engaged to lend their helping
hands.</p>
            <p>For erecting in <hi>London</hi> and other great Cities
banks or mounts or Piety, (as have been long
uſed in <hi>Italy,</hi> in <hi>Flanders</hi> and other Countreys,)
whereby the intollerable oppreſſion of publique
and private Brokers and Pawn-takes (that grinde
the faces of the poor, ſcruing out of them 40
or 50 <hi>per Cent.</hi>) may be utterly aboliſht.</p>
            <p>For erecting Hoſpitals in <hi>London</hi> and other
Citys (as there is at <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi>) for to
receive all little Infants expoſed or found; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
many poor Innocents deſtroyed in the
womb, or at the Birth, might be preſerved from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40842:5"/>
Murder, as well as the unnatural Mothers from
hanging.</p>
            <p>For building of Hoſpitals to accommodate
therein all poor Women (as is done at <hi>Paris</hi>)
neer the time of their Travel, to enter and
there to be carefully delivered, and remain af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
till they are in a condition to return
home and follow their work.</p>
            <p>For providing ſtipends for Phyſicians, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons
and Apothecaries (as at <hi>Rome</hi>) to give
<hi>gratis</hi> their Advice, Pains, Medicines and Salves
to poor ſick or wounded people, allowed in
<hi>forma pauperis</hi> to require their aſſiſtance, who
otherwiſe periſh for want of timely and due
helps.</p>
            <p>For erecting Colledges in <hi>London</hi> (as is done
in <hi>Holland</hi>) where old men deprived of Wife
and Children may for a reaſonable ſum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
be neatly accomodated during life, with
Diet and Lodging, and paſs the reſt of their days
without care or trouble in a comfortable ſociety
with men of like condition and age. And the
like for old Women.</p>
            <p>For erecting Colledges wherein Virgins and
Widows of the Proteſtant Religion, reſolving
not to marry (as the Begains in <hi>Holland, Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,
Flanders, &amp;c.</hi>) may for a certain ſumme
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40842:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of money depoſed, be maintained, and live in
a retired vertuous and religious Society; their
Teaching and Educating in Vertue and Piety
the Female youth of this Nation (whereof there
is now more need then ever) and ſuch young
Virgin-Scholars may there remain conſtantly till
their marriage day, before which time very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
by too much liberty are now corrupted and
debauched: and that the ſaid Virgins and Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
of the Society, may (with the forfeiture
of the ſaid Money depoſed, and leave of their
Viſitor) be free to alter their reſolutions, and
quit the Society.</p>
            <p>For erecting in <hi>London</hi> a Colledge <hi>de propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda
Fide</hi> (as our Adverſaries have done at
<hi>Rome</hi>) for propagating the Chriſtian Reformed
Religion amongſt the <hi>Americans</hi> bordering on
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations, (where it is ſhame to
this Nation, that ſo few in the ſpace of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years have been converted to Chriſtianity)
and for that end to ſend from time to time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
fitly Gifted for a work ſo tranſcendently
Pious: And becauſe many excelling in the gift
of Preaching, being now for their Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
laid aſide, do ſecretly occaſion unlawful
Conventicles, foment Schiſms, and hold up the
Faction, and thereby hazard the diſturbance
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40842:6"/>
of this Church and State, that all they (not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
from the Doctrine of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church)
may be encouraged by competent allowances
out of the ſaid publique Stock, or commanded
to Transport themſelves thither within the ſpace
of one or two years.</p>
            <p>For buying in of Impropriations (a work
not only worthy of a Parliament, but to the
doing whereof, all the Parliaments ſince 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8.
ſtand obnoxious (ſaith the learned <hi>Bacon</hi>) and
bound in conſcience to God) whereby the
Church might enjoy her own again, the Kings
Revenue much encreaſed by Tenths and Firſt-Fruits,
and the Cures of all thoſe great and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
Pariſhes hitherto ſtarved for want of
Spiritual food be duely ſerved, and the foule
guilt of that abominable ſin of Sacriledge taken
off this Nation, and off the Proteſtant Religion.
Provided, that no Impropriator ſhall take above
10 or 12 years Purchaſe for any Impropriated
Tythes, as the Cuſtom uſually hath been.</p>
            <p>For making ſome competent Proviſion (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the practice of other Reformed
Churches) for the poor Widows and Orphans
of Clergy-men, of whom God took ſpecial
care in the Jewiſh Commonwealth, the Sons
there being to inherit their Fathers places, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40842:6"/>
the Daughters to be match'd aſwell as their
Mothers: or elſe, as in other Chriſtian Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
utterly to forbid Marriage to all that ſhall
be in Orders.</p>
            <p>Some other chargeable Propoſals probably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
to this Nation, might be hereunto ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by ſuch as have made it their buſineſs to
obſerve this and other civil Governments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Seas; alſo ſome other ways and
means of raiſing moneys without grieving the
People, which is the quinteſcence of all State-policy;
but let thoſe be reſerved for another
occaſion. Hereafter follow divers unchargeable
Propoſals that will require no coſt or charges,
but only the Humble petition of the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of Parliament, and his Majeſties Royal
Aſſent.</p>
            <p>XI. It is an ancient <hi>Maxime: Intereſt Reip.
ut reſua quiſque bene utatur;</hi> It is the Intereſt of
the Common-wealth, that every Subject ſhould
make a right uſe of his own Eſtate: wherefore
amongſt the Fundamental Laws of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
thoſe Laws of the twelve Tables, (obſerved by
them almoſt as Sacredly as the Two Tables or
Ten Commandments by the <hi>Jews</hi>) it is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
provided, That a Guardian ſhould be ſet
over the Perſon and Eſtate, not only of Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40842:7"/>
but of all prodigal Perſons: This Law
hath been derived from them to all our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Nations,
and enjoyed by them ever ſince
they enjoyed Civility, even to this very day.
To <hi>England</hi> only this Law is wanting, not that
<hi>England</hi> is without ſuch unreaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
for it hath been obſerved that the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
Nation is naturally as much addicted to
prodigality as any Nation in <hi>Europe;</hi> the ſad
effects whereof are every day before our eyes;
Wives that have brought great Eſtates, left
poor needy Widows; Children of Noble and
illuſtrious Families, brought to a morſel of
bread, and to do baſe ignominious things, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of their Noble Anceſtors, and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
to the very degrees of Honour which
their Fathers purchaſed by their Merit, and
maintained by their laudable Frugality. Where
this fore-mentioned Law is in uſe, the prodigal
perſon is thus defined <hi>[Is qui neque modum ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
finem habet in Expenſis].</hi> Any man being
proved to be ſuch is declared uncapable of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
his own Eſtate, or of making a Will,
or of entring into Bond, or of being a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
&amp;c. And thereupon a Guardian is put
over him and his Eſtate, to allow him neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
out of his own Eſtate, and to preſerve the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40842:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reſt to his next Kindred. Now the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
hath his <hi>Breve de Inquirendo de Idiota,</hi>
and his <hi>Breve de Inquirendo de Furioſo;</hi> and can
any ſolid reaſon be produced why his Majeſty
ſhould not have alſo his <hi>Breve de Inquirendo de
Prodigo</hi> directed in like manner to the Eſcheater
of the County to be tryed by a Jury of
twelve men? that ſo a general ſtop may be
put to the wild expences and extravagant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeneſs
of all <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, and more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(as in <hi>Spain,</hi> becauſe the Nobility is eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the chief and main ſupport of Monarchy)
that no Noble man ſhall have power to waſte
or alienate ſo much of his Anceſtors Lands as
may render him uncapable of ſerving his
Prince and Countrey, or to bear the Port of
a Noble man.</p>
            <p>XII. There is another <hi>Maxime [Intereſt
Reipub. ut ſuprema hominum Teſtamenta rata
habeantur ſecundum veram Teſtatoris Intentionem]</hi>
It concerns the Common-wealth, that mens
laſt Wills and Teſtaments ſhould be ratified
and executed according to the true meaning
of the Teſtator; For this purpoſe was made
the Statute of Charitable uſes 43 of Q <hi>El.</hi> to
provide againſt the imbezilling and miſ-imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Moneys and Lands given to Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40842:8"/>
Uſes, by giving power to the Biſhop and his
Chancellour, and to ſome other conſiderable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
to iſſue out Commiſſions for inquiring and
ordering the ſame.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, by the neglect of ſome, and
want of zeal in others, ſuch Commiſſions are
ſeldome deſired, though perhaps not hardly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p>Wherefore that by another Statute it may be
provided, that every Biſhop and his Chancellour
(together with ſome other conſiderable perſons,
as is intimated in the fore-quoted Statute) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
one year after each Biſhops Inſtalment, ſhall
upon a high penalty purchaſe and execute ſuch
Commiſſion throughout his Dioceſs.</p>
            <p>XIII. That according to the Inſtitution of
King <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, our Engliſh Juſtinian,
once every three year Juſtices <hi>de Trail Baſton</hi>
may be commiſſionated to make Inquiſition
through the Realm, by the verdict of ſubſtantial
Juries, upon all Officers, Sheriffs, Mayors, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
of Peace, Coroners, Eſcheators, Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs,
Conſtables, Jaylors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> touching their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
Extortions, Briberies, Cheatings; touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Malegovernment and neglect of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
the good Laws reſpectively.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:40842:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
XIV. That the Statutes of 12 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. and
5 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. againſt the ſale of Offices, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived,
that ſo Vertue and Wiſdom, long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
and honeſty, faithfulneſs and loyalty,
may no longer be baffled and diſcouraged, by
ſeeing it ſelf vilified, and money preponderate all
worth, and thereby Juſtice very oft ſold, with
divers other Inconveniences.</p>
            <p>XV. That proviſion by a Statute be made
againſt that Unchriſtian, and more then barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
cuſtom and priviledg of <hi>Wreccum Maris,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
allowed by the Imperial Laws, or any neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Nation, and once baniſht out of <hi>England</hi>
by an Act made 2 <hi>R.</hi> 1. that in caſe of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack,
though all perſons periſhed, yet that all
the goods which eſcaped ſhould be carefully
preſerved for the owners, or next of kin, if they
come within a year and a day; onely allowing
ſomething to thoſe that helpt to ſave the goods,
and preſerved them afterwards.</p>
            <p>XVI. That by a Law the Fees of Lawyers
may be regulated according to the moderation
of other well policed Countreys, where uſually
is given but a third or fourth part of what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
in <hi>England.</hi> And that if any Lawyer
preſume to take more then the Fees by Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
he may be rendred uncapable to practice
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40842:9"/>
any more, and forfeit four-fold of what he
hath ſo taken, as is provided by the Civil
Laws.</p>
            <p>XVII. That as in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the
Second, the number of Attorneys was regulated
and 140 declared to be ſufficient to ſerve this
whole Kingdom; ſo now that the number of
Lawyers and Attorneys may be regulated, and
ſome things in their Pleadings reformed. What
a ſhame to our Nation is it, that ſo many evil
and rapacious Lawyers ſhould be permitted to
plead in behalf of vitious perſons, and of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
oppreſſors, and in cauſes notoriouſly unjuſt;
ſhould be permitted to make a trade not to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
Juſtice, but to heap up riches, and devour
all the fat of the Land.</p>
            <p>XVIII. That proviſion may be made to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate
all ſuch Laws which by the change of
things and times are now become over ſevere
and rigorous, much beyond the intent of the
Law-makers. As that ſtealing to the value of
12 d. ſhould ſtill be Felony, whereas when
that Law was firſt made, what was then ſold for
12 d. (which (when the ounce of Silver was
but 20 d.) was as much as 3 s. now) is now
ſold for above 40 s; for in 51 of K. <hi>H.</hi> 3. eight
Buſhels of wheat was then ſold but for 12 d;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40842:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo that the man that ſtole but ſeven Buſhels
committed but <hi>petty Larceny,</hi> whereas now he
that ſteals but a Peck may be found guilty of
Felony (unleſs the Jury will forſwear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
as commonly they do, and bring in
Eleven pence ſtoln when ſometimes it is Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſhillings) as if the life of Man in our days
were of a ſmaller and viler price then in thoſe
days. So in the time of <hi>H.</hi> 2. the ſtealing of
Oxen and Horſes were counted <hi>inter minuta
furta,</hi> which Lawyers call <hi>Parvum Latrocinium,</hi>
or <hi>Petty Larceny.</hi> Now why ſhould the body of
Man, that <hi>Divinae imaginis vehiculum</hi> be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
for trifles? why ſhould Chriſtians now
be more cruel then the Jews, or then Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in former ages? for in the middle ages of
Chriſtianity <hi>Paenarum ratio in multis potius quam
in ſanguine &amp; neceſita fuit.</hi> They them allowed
a compenſation even for killing of a man cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Wergeld, quaſi viri moneta ſive praetium,</hi>
which was with great juſtice paid partly to the
King for the loſs of his Subject, and partly to
the Lord whoſe Vaſſal the ſlain party was,
but eſpecially to the next Kindred of the perſon
ſlain; and this cuſtom ſeemed to derive it ſelf
from <hi>Moſes</hi> Law. <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 30. Our Anceſtors
in this Kingdom before they were Chriſtians
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40842:10"/>
had this Cuſtom, then thinking it againſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that when one man was killed, and the
King thereby had loſt a ſubject, that another
ſhould be put to death, and ſo the King loſe
another ſubject, and the Kindred of the ſlain
no way recompenſed for their loſs, as now is
uſed: And after they were converted to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
and did believe that penitent Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
went to Heaven, they thought it more
againſt reaſon, when a man was ſlain, to ſend
the penitent man-ſlayer forthwith from this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
world to a place of everlaſting bliſs, but
rather that he ſhould by a corporal or pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary
mulct be made miſerable in this life, it
being much more ſuitable to the ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
that a criminal ſhould live in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
ignominy, ſlavery or miſery, rather then
be taken quite away, becauſe a living con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
wretched Criminal will be a ſpectacle
in others eyes, will in time be convinced of his
Crime, will juſtifie his Judg, and continually
repent his own folly. And therefore, even
ſince the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt for Treaſon, or foul
Felonies, the guilty were oft condemned to have
their eyes pulled forth, or their Teſticles cut
out, that there might be no more of the breed,
or elſe that their hands or feet ſhould be chopt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40842:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
off, that ſo each foul Felon might remain <hi>truncus
vivus</hi> as a living monument of his Felonious
fact, for deterring others, and have time to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail
his own ſins and miſery: But becauſe in
<hi>England</hi> too much ſeverity is uſed againſt Theft,
and yet not enough to reſtrain it ſufficiently; and
becauſe the wiſdom of Prevention is better then
the wiſdom of remedy;</p>
            <p>XIX. That to prevent Thievery, the like
courſe may be taken in <hi>England</hi> which is uſed
in <hi>Holland,</hi> eſpecially in that moſt populous
City of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> where (as God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Jews Deut.</hi> 15. 4.) <hi>Non eſt Indigens, nec
Mendicus inter illos, &amp; benedicit illis Dominus:</hi>
There is not a Beggar amongſt ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thouſand: To effect which they do three
things, they take eſpecial Order that all Youth
be bred up, not onely in the knowledge of
God, but of ſome Trade or Profeſſion: They
provide work for all ſorts of People; and
Thirdly, they compel all ſuch as are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to work. By this policy, in <hi>Holland</hi> it is
rate to ſee an Execution for Robbery; and
yet if a man could but ſee at once all the Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
Young and Old, Male and Female that have
been hanged in <hi>England</hi> in one year onely for
ſtealing; what Horror and Amazement it would
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40842:11"/>
ſtrike, and how would a <hi>Hollander</hi> juſtly blame
the policy of this State, for <hi>Non minus turpia
ſunt Principi multa ſupplicia, quam Medico mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
funera.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XX. That for redreſſing thoſe high Crimes
(ſo accounted by all Gods people heretofore,
though now in <hi>England</hi> little conſcience is
made thereof) of wilfully robbing God or
the King; the one in his Tythes, and the other
in his Tributes, Cuſtoms or Revenues; it may
be made abſolute Felony for the future, and
very ſevere puniſhment inflicted, as it is now in
other Countreys, and was anciently in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>To cozen the King but of Treaſure Trove
was antiently (as affirmeth <hi>Glanvile</hi> and <hi>Bracton</hi>)
an offence puniſht with death. And 31 of <hi>Eliz.</hi>
it was judged meet by the whole Parliament to
make it Felony for any man to embezil but
the worth of Twenty ſhillings of the Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
or Victuals provided by the Queen for
her Souldiers.</p>
            <p>XXI. That, according to the Law of God,
according to Chriſtian Clemency, Gentleneſs
and Mercy, according to the Laws of other
Chriſtian States, and according to the antient
Laws and Cuſtoms of this State; no perſon
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40842:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hereafter may for any new Debt be caſt in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but rather that his Eſtate may be ſeized,
and the perſon left at liberty to work himſelf
out of Debt by his Induſtry, Trade or Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
to which end, if Creditors did proceed
onely by Summons, after which legally ſerved
at the Debtors Houſe, and no appearance
made, then preſently proceed to have a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt the Debtor, as if he had appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and then to Execution; and thereupon, to
ſeize not his perſon but Eſtate; and in caſe he
hath no Eſtate, yet to forbear, till by his indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
he hath gotten ſomewhat: for impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is not only too ſevere a puniſhment of
the Body, a torment of the Mind, a dying dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
a loſs of Reputation, and alienation of
Friends, a ſeparation from Wife and Children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and a great occaſion of being ever after debaucht
and diſhoneſt; but it is alſo clearly againſt the
Creditors profit and advantage; for the Debtor
being caſt in priſon, muſt there lie at much more
charges then at home, and yet find leſs op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to work or earn any thing, which
makes him commonly hold faſter what is in his
hands, which elſe he would have parted with
towards the ſatisfaction of his Debts, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
by his Work or Trade to have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40842:12"/>
himſelf and Family. Beſides, by impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
the body of a Debtor, the State loſeth
a Member, which at liberty, or compelled to
work, might be of ſome uſe.</p>
            <p>XXII. That ſome Proviſion be made (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as is excellently provided by the Civil
Law) againſt that Unchriſtian Cuſtome of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting
the body of a deceaſed Debtor, or of any
his Relations, whileſt they accompany the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to the Grave. Alſo againſt that vexatious
and ſuperſtitious cuſtome of ſtopping any
dead body in its paſſage through any Town or
Lordſhip, and demanding ſome Fee or Toll for
the ſame, before the body paſs further on.</p>
            <p>XXIII. That the Admiralty, and all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
and Civil Law Courts may enjoy their
due Juriſdictions, That thoſe Juriſdictions may
be declared and known, that ſo no man (when
he hath brought his ſuit almoſt to a Tryal) may
by a Prohibition be conſtrained to begin all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in a new Court, to his horrible vexation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
and charges.</p>
            <p>XXIV. That according to the ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
of this and all other Chriſtiain States, all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Judges may have a power to proceed
<hi>Ex Officio;</hi> That way of Enquiry being exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neceſſary for correcting of vice and ſin
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40842:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which otherwiſe will daily go unpuniſhed: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that by the Civil Law it is called <hi>Nobile
Judicis Officium,</hi> and was never oppoſed but by
the Factious Puritanical part of <hi>England,</hi> out of
deſign to diſturb the Engliſh Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
ſuch enquiry and proceeding <hi>Ex Officio</hi>
without an Accuſer, but onely upon publick
fame, ſtrong Preſumption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being approved
by ſundry examples of Scripture, as well as by
all Canon, Civil, and Common Laws.</p>
            <p>It is true, that by the Conſtitutions at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law it hath not been held fit that any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſhould be examined upon Oath againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
touching a Crime, whereby his Life, or any
of his Limbs may be endangered; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is, for fear of occaſioning Perjury, becauſe
moſt men probably would rather hazard an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true
Oath, (although no good Chriſtian ought
ſo to do) then either their Lives or their Limbs.
But yet in Criminal matters, not Capital, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in Chancery, the Oath of the party is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
againſt himſelf: onely there is an Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer,
and an Accuſation of Bill of Complaint,
and not a meer inſinuation of fame, as in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<hi>ex Officio</hi> ſometimes. But then it is to be
conſidered that the Complainant, to find out the
truth, may ſtuff his Bill full of Lyes, becauſe he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40842:13"/>
is not ſworn to the Truth of the Bill, as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
is to the Truth of his Anſwer; And what
is this leſs then the proceeding <hi>Ex Officio,</hi> when
the Defendant is forced in his Anſwer (which
is alwayes upon Oath) to accuſe himſelf. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
in dangerous Crimes againſt the Perſon
of the King, or Peace of the Kingdom, it hath
alwayes been held neceſſary and lawful Policy,
to torture ſuch perſons againſt whom good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities
and ſtrong preſumptions lie, to make
them confeſs, although it be capital againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and others in the higheſt degree: And is
it not of as great equity in high Crimes againſt
the King of Heaven and Earth, and in Crimes
of no leſs ſecreſie, as Atheiſm, Apoſtacy, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery,
Inceſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to uſe the means of the
Parties Oath, eſpecially where no Capital, no
Corporal puniſhment is intended, but onely
a fatherly and ſpiritual correcting and reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Party for his ſouls health? More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
the proceeding <hi>Ex Officio,</hi> is not (as many
vainly imagine) onely the miniſtring of an
Oath to the ſuſpected party againſt himſelf in
a Cauſe Criminal; for there may be proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Ex Officio Judicis,</hi> though, the Oath be not
at all urged; nay, ſometimes it may not be
urged, as in caſe of Life or Limb endangered
thereby.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:40842:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Now if there ſhould be in <hi>England</hi> no means
for an Eccleſiaſtical Judg to take cognizance,
nor to proceed but upon the voluntary proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and accuſation of ſome party, how many
execrable offences moſt diſpleaſing to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
ſcandalous to the Godly, dangerous
to mens Inheritances, and to the ſouls health
of the offenders; yea, ſome that are the very
bane of all Religion and Chriſtianity, would
through want of diſcovery, and by impunity,
in a few years ſpread themſelves over this whole
Church and State before any Accuſers will be
found? As Atheiſm, Apoſtacy from Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
Hereſie, Schiſme, Errors in matters of
Religion, Sacriledge, Perjury, Blaſphemy, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ornation
of Perjury, Swearing, Polygamy, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
Inceſt, and other Uncleanneſs, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
exceſſive Uſury, Symony, Forgery, Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Holy Miniſtry, Conventicles, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
Libelling, and many other abuſes: For
who commonly are privy to ſuch ſins, but men
of like humour and affection, who can never
be preſumed to be likely to accuſe, but rather
to conceal ſuch horrid offenders; and therefore
ſince that power of thus proceeding was by that
moſt pernicious over-ruling Faction in the Long
Parliament extorted from the Church; How
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40842:14"/>
have all thoſe formentioned Impieties, like a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Deluge, overwhelmed the Manners of
Engliſh men?</p>
            <p>XXV. That it may by a Law be provided
(according to the practice of other well-policed
States) that an obſtinate debaucht Son may be
puniſht by the Magiſtrate as the Father ſhall
reaſonably require, and that in ſome certain
Caſes, (as is ordained by the Imperial Laws)
<hi>Liberi a poteſtate patria liberati in poteſtatem redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantur,
ut ſi fuerint ingrati vel inſignitèr injurioſi
in parentes ſuos, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXVI. That no man, til he attain to the age
of 25, (according to the Cuſtom of our Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Neighbours where men are ſooner ripe)
may be enabled to ſell or alienate his Lands,
conſidering that in <hi>England</hi> very many Eſtates
have been moſt fooliſhly ſpent and ſold, after
the age of 21. which by the ſame perſons, arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to their Wits before 25. would have been
preſerved.</p>
            <p>XXVII. That (according to the Policy of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
the Conquerour for aſſuring of Peace and
Concord) no man of any conſiderable Eſtate,
who was in actual Rebellion againſt the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
or preſent King, may be permitted to match
their Sons and Daughters (as they now do) to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40842:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thoſe of their own Tribe and Faction, thereby
entailing Non-conformity and Faction, and
perpetuating an impious hatred againſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Government of Church and State.</p>
            <p>XXVIII. That to take off the preſent continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
charge of Foot and Horſe in conſtant pay, and
yet aſſure peace amongſt us, that moſt excellent
and politique Law may be revived called <hi>Viſus
Franci Plegii</hi> whereby all men under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Gentry and Clergy, may ſtand obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to find Suretyes for their Loyalty toward
the King; and thoſe Suretyes to be bound to
find each man of their Pledge to be forth
coming within 31 days, or elſe to ſatisfie for
his offence; and that all perſons who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
find ſuch Suretyes, may be impriſoned or
baniſh'd. This Cuſtom was by our Anceſtors
ſo highly approved, that by <hi>Bracton</hi> it is called
<hi>Res quaſi Sacra quia ſolam perſonam Regis reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit
&amp; introductus fuit pro pace &amp; communi uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate
Regni.</hi> And in caſe this ſhould not be aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto; then conſidering that the King muſt
neceſſarily be at the continual charge of armed
men to bridle the proud diſloyal humour of all
thoſe ſons of <hi>Belial,</hi> who obſtinately refuſe
Conformity to the Government eſtabliſht, that
they all, in all Taxes may be obliged to pay
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40842:15"/>
double, if not to defray the whole charges,
which they themſelves occaſion.</p>
            <p>XXIX. That Repeal may be made of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Law of puniſhing the Innocent in caſe he
flie: for if a man be accuſed of a capital Crime
and perceiving the power and malice of his
Enemy, and the often, and corruption, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
of ſome Judge, ſhould run away for fear
of the event, and afterwards be taken and
brought to a legal Trial, and there making it
ſufficiently appear that he was not guilty of
the Crime, is thereof acquitted; yet ſhall he
be by our Law condemned to looſe his Goods.
It is true, that a written Law may forbid Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents
to fly, but that flying, for fear of injury
ſhould (after a man is abſolved of a Crime iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially)
be taken for preſumption of Guilt,
is contrary to the nature of a preſumption,
which ought to have no place after Judgement
given.</p>
            <p>XXX. That for the poor who are aſhamed
to diſcover their Poverty, and to declare their
wants, there may be yearly appointed Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
or Overſeers (according to that Excellent
cuſtom in <hi>Holland</hi>) to go to their Houſes, and
there privately to inform themſelves of their
neceſſities and condition of life, and to take
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40842:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
care for a private Relief before they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to beg or do worſe.</p>
            <p>XXXI. That for the great uſe and benefit of
the Poor, and the more convenient diſtribution of
the Charity of the Rich, there may be (according
to the preſent cuſtom of all other civilized Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys)
coyned by the King (and not by Victualers
and Retailers) a ſufficient quantity of Farthings
and half Farthings, and thoſe made of ſuch Metal
that it may be no loſs to the King, no profit
for others to counterfeit them; and that they
may be made of ſuch a bigneſs, that they may
not be apt to be loſt, nor yet burdenſom to
carry; all which is done in divers other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys.</p>
            <p>XXXII. That according to the wiſdom of
our Anceſtors, and the cuſtom of the moſt civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
Nations, ſome ſumptuary Laws may be
made, whereby the great Exceſs, eſpecially in
the inferior ſort of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> may be reſtrained,
and moſt Degrees and Orders may be diſcerned
by their Habit or Port, as now in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities
and amongſt the Clergy is partly done.</p>
            <p>XXXIII. That as in the Courts at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
ſo much more in the higheſt Court of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
all Parliament men whilſt they attend on
the Parliament may be obliged upon high penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40842:16"/>
to wear a Robe or Veſtment becoming their
reſpective Perſons, and the Gravity and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament of Great Counſel
of <hi>England</hi> (as all the Nobility and Gentry
both young and old who have right to ſit in
the Great Counſel at <hi>Venice,</hi> and all the <hi>Roman</hi>
Senators did antiently and do at this day) that
ſo they may every where be diſcerned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their due reſpect, and be aſhamed to be
ſeen frequently in Play-houſes, Dicing-houſes,
Cockpits, Taverns or Houſes of worſe repute;
or to be Night-walkers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And during their
attendance on Parliament if they be found in
ſuch places and ways out of their Robe or Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then to looſe their wonted Protection
from Arreſts according to that ſaying [God
giveth his Angels charge over us to keep us,
whilſt we are in our ways] but out of our way;
no protection of this Angels to be expected.]
Let no man here object that Parliament men
ought rather to wear their ſwords, which ſuit
not with Robes or Gowns, becauſe the Writ
to the Sheriff runs for to chooſe <hi>duos Milites
gladiis cinctos,</hi> for the meaning thereof is two
Knights dubbed, which in thoſe days was done
by girding on a ſword: but it was ever expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and ſometimes eſpecially commanded
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40842:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that they ſhould attend on Parliament a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
of Peace <hi>gladiis diſcincti,</hi> and their Robes
then will be ſufficient Guard for their perſons
as well in <hi>England,</hi> as it is now in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys.</p>
            <p>XXXIV. That as the Coins, ſo the Weights
and Meaſures both wet and dry may be (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and 14. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
alike all over <hi>England,</hi> as it is carefully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
in other Countreys.</p>
            <p>XXXV. That moſt, if not all eatable things
expoſed to ſale in the Market as well as in Shops,
may be ſold by weight, (as is done in <hi>Spain</hi>)
and alſo may weekly or monthly be Rated
(as Bread in Cities) by the Magiſtrates or Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
ſworn ſo to do.</p>
            <p>XXXVI. That, (according to the good Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
of <hi>Italy</hi>) all Taverns, Innes, Ale-houſes,
Victualling-houſes, may be obliged to have a
printed Table hang publickly of the Prices of
all ſuch things as they are wont or allowed to ſell
to Gueſts.</p>
            <p>XXXVII. That no Vintner, Inn-keeper,
Ale-ſeller, Victualer or Malſter, may in any
Corporation be intruſted with the Execution of
thoſe Laws which may any ways prejudice their
profit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:40842:17"/>
XXXVIII. That to reduce ſervants to their
priſtine and due humility, diligence, frugality,
faithfulneſs and obedience, a Law be made that
no Servant ſhall be henceforth received into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other ſervice without a Teſtimonial under
the Hands and Seals of their former Maſter or
Miſtris, that they are competently endowed
with all thoſe qualities forementioned.</p>
            <p>XXXIX. That (according to the excellent
policy of the <hi>Romans</hi>) there may be appointed
ſome perſons of the beſt Rank and Quality, both
in City and Country to <hi>Cenſores Morum,</hi> for
reforming of Manners, to be furniſht with
a power to enquire into mens lives, to take
notice if any man neglect his Farm, Trade or
Profeſſion; and how he otherwiſe maintaineth
himſelf.</p>
            <p>XL. That ſpecial Proviſion be made for exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
all our good Laws enacted for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of Tillage, where more people may be
ſet on work, and they rendred more ſtrong and
ſtout for ſervice of their Country againſt an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.
And likewiſe the Laws made for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of Fiſhing, whereby more people may
be fitted for Sea-ſervice, whereof this Kingdom
ſurrounded almoſt with the Sea will ever have
ſpecial occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:40842:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
XLI. That according to the good Policy
of our Anceſtors, all the married Nobility and
Gentry of <hi>England</hi> (without ſpecial leave of his
Majeſty to do otherwiſe) may be obliged to
keep houſe in the Country, every one at his own
<hi>Manerium,</hi> ſo named, a <hi>Manendo</hi> of abiding
there, <hi>Vt ſemper preſto eſſent ad Servitia Regis
&amp; Patriae per implenda,</hi> to be ready there to
ſerve his King and Country, and by a laudable
Hoſpitality to gain the affections and dependan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Peaſantry.</p>
            <p>XLII. That according to antient Canons of
the Church, and according to divers other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches, and according to the cuſtom
of the Primitive Chriſtians, no dead body may
be hereafter interred in any Church, eſpecially
in <hi>London,</hi> or the Suburbs thereof, but either
in ſome Vault or elſe in the Church-yard, or
rather in ſome decent encloſed place without
the City. To bury in Churches is to the dead
but a ſuperſtitious cuſtom firſt brought in by
the Franciſcan and Dominican Fryars about the
year One thouſand one hundred, when Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
was almoſt at the height, invented to
get Money, perſwading the people that to be
buried within the Church, or near the High
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40842:18"/>
Altar was more availeable to their ſouls: and
to the Living it is not onely chargeable but
moſt unwholeſome, that ſo many putrified
Carcaſſes ſhould be ſo near under their Noſes
all the time of their Devotion.</p>
            <p>XLIII. That as all Clergy-men are by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law exempted from all inferior Offices,
as Bailiff, Bedel, Conſtable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ſerve nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>per ſe nec per alium,</hi> to the end that they
may attend their function; ſo that they may
(according to meer reaſon, and according to
a Statute 8. <hi>H.</hi> 4 num. 12. in the unprinted
Parliament Rolls) be exempted from arraying
and muſtring of Men or Horſe for the War:
For their Glebe Lands, and Spiritual Revenues
being held in <hi>Pura &amp; perpetua Eleemoſyna.</hi> i. e.
<hi>in Frank Almoyne,</hi> ought by <hi>Magna Charta</hi> to be
exempted from all ſuch burthens. And as for
their perſons, they ſerve their Countrey other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
and for that ſervice ought to be counted
worthy (as well, if not better then the <hi>Levites</hi>
of old) of their Spiritual Profits and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
and alſo worthy of the Kings Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not only for their Service, but alſo in that
they pay to the King the firſt years Profits,
and every year the Tenth of all Spiritual Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40842:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Beſides the Clergy being by their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
prohibited to wear ſwords, may neither
ſerve in perſon, nor can be capable of any Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
as Knighthood uſually conferred on
Warriours.</p>
            <p>XLIV. That as <hi>nullum tempus occurrit Regi,</hi>
no Cuſtom nor preſcription may be pleaded to
the prejudice of the King; ſo alſo with much
more reaſon, that no Cuſtom nor Preſcription
may be pleaded to the prejudice of the King of
kings: That all Compoſitions or Cuſtoms of
paying a little money for a great Tythe may
be every where abrogated, and all Tythes taken
again in kind, or a new Compoſition according
to the preſent value, which is but juſtice and
more concerns this Parliament to do for the
Church then it concerned the Parliament 18 of
<hi>Eliz.</hi> to do for Colledges by obliging their
Tenants to pay onethird part of their old Rent
in Corn.</p>
            <p>XLV. That all Lands antiently belonging
to the Knights, Templars, Hoſpitallers, of St.
<hi>John of Jeruſalem,</hi> or to the Order of Ciſterci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Monks, which by Popiſh diſpenſation were
antiently exempted from paying Tythes, may
<hi>de novo</hi> be obliged as all other Lands in <hi>England</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:40842:19"/>
to pay Tythes; at leaſt all thoſe Lands given
to thoſe Orders ſince the time they were ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted,
as by all Law and Juſtice they ought
to do.</p>
            <p>XLVI. That our Eccleſiaſtical Officers, as
Chancellours, Commiſſaries, Officials, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may
be in Holy Orders as the Canoniſts and modern
Legiſts in the Romiſh Church, are for the moſt
part; that ſo neither the Romaniſts on one hand,
nor Presbiterians on the other, may have
ſo much reaſon to except againſt them in the
matter of Excommunication, as executed by
Lay Hands: <hi>Vtcunque illi non aſſumunt clavium
poteſtatem ſed tantummodo poenam Canonis decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
&amp; infligunt ob contumaciam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XLVII. That Regiſters may be ſetled in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Hundred, or in every County at leaſt, and
all Lands and Houſes may be entred into that
Book, and therein all Alienations to be ſet down
in Alphabetical Order, and none to be authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
if not there entred, that ſo no man hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
may be cheated by a Premorgage or any
other way, but that all men may be ſatisfied
in what they poſſeſs, and what they may call
their own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:40842:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
XLVIII. That as among the <hi>Jews</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
immediate Divine appointment, the
chief Clergy man <hi>Aaron</hi> was Brother to the
Supream Magiſtrate <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prieſts,
and the Levites were all of Noble ſtock:
and as amongſt Chriſtians even here in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
antiently, and at this day in forreign
Chriſtian States, the chief Clergy have been
oft of Noble and ſometimes Royal bloud,
and the ordinary Prieſts uſually ſons of the
Gentry, whereby they come to be more
highly Honoured, and their juſt Authority
better obeyed; ſo now in <hi>England,</hi> that
the two Archbiſhops may be (if poſſible)
of the Higheſt, Noble (if not Royal) bloud
of <hi>England,</hi> and all the Biſhops of Noble
bloud, and the inferior Prieſts, ſons of the
Gentry, and not (after the example of that
wicked Rebel <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and our late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicans)
to make Prieſts of the loweſt of
the People, whilſt Phyſick and Law, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
inferior to Divinity, are generally
embraced by Gentlemen, and ſometimes
by perſons Nobly deſcended, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
much above the Divines Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:40842:20"/>
XLIX. That as in the Univerſities, all Heads
of Colledges (if their Founders intentions were
rightly obſerved) and all Fellows of Colledges
are obliged <hi>communi jure</hi> ſo long as they
hold thoſe places to abſtain from Marriage
and the carnal knowledge of Women, ſo
in the Church, that not only Archbiſhops
and Biſhops, but all others that take any
Eccleſiaſtical Benefice, may by a Statute be
obliged ſo long as they hold thoſe Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
to abſtain in like manner; and as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Diſpenſation no man can hold two
Benefices with Cure of Souls, ſo no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
man ſhould take a wife without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Diſpenſation (in ſome few caſes to
be allowed) or reſigning his Benefice. To
ſay they cannot abſtain, or ſhall be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
for want of Wives to do worſe; all
Fellows of Colledges, who commonly there
paſs the very heat of their Youth, might
with much more reaſon plead the ſame, and
yet would be derided for their pains. By
which abſtinance the Clergy would be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to be much more hoſpitable and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable,
and ſo better beloved, they would
live with more gravity and decency, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40842:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo more feared, they might then far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
attend their Studies and Cure of Souls,
and ſo be able to give up a better account
at laſt.</p>
            <p>L. That, according to the good Policy
of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Chancellours or Vice-Chancellours
of both our Univerſities may
be obliged to deliver the King every fourth
of fifth year a juſt, true and impartial Liſt
of all the eminent and hopeful Students,
eſpecially thoſe of the Civil Law, to ſet
down punctually their Names, Colledges,
Standings and Faculty, wherein they did
or were likely to excel; that ſo when any
occaſion ſhould be to ſend an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
abroad, the King might nominate
him an Aſſociate, a Secrecary or Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain;
and when any preferment fit for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of an Accademical Education ſhould
fall, the King might make choice of the
perſon.</p>
            <p>LI. That all Advouſons of <hi>England,</hi> not
now in the Crown, may be all bought
in at reaſonable values, and ſetled for ever
upon the Crown, that ſo all Rectors of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes
(as well as Biſhops, Deans and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bends)
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40842:21"/>
may have their dependance on the
Kings bounty onely, (as all the Clergy in
ſome Reformed Churches now have) and
not on any mean, covetous, illiterate, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious,
heterodox, ſymoniacal or ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Patron; by which one means all the
Engliſh Clergy would ſoon become Loyal
and Orthodox, of one mind, and of one
Lip; the whole Engliſh Church would flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
in a perfect Unity, and a beautiful U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity,
and God would then delight to
dwell amongſt us,</p>
            <p>LII. That (ſince divers known Jews are
by His Majeſties Princely Clemency per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
again to inhabit in this Kingdom)
ſome good Laws (according to the wiſdom
of His Majeſties Predeceſſours, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
practice of other well-policed Chriſtian
Dominions) may be enacted in order both
to the Chriſtians ſafety, and the Jews Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
It was the ancient Law of <hi>England,</hi> as
appears in <hi>Fleta,</hi> that a Chriſtian, whether
man or woman, that married with a Jew,
ſhould be burnt alive.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Italy,</hi> by expreſs Law of all Jews
(even in thoſe places where they are freely
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40842:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
permitted to dwel) are made uncapable to
bear any office or dignity in the State, nor
to take any degree in the Univerſity, or to
be ſeen in publick without a diſtinct mark
to be diſcerned from all Chriſtians, nor erect
any new Synagogues, nor circumciſe any
not born of a Jew, nor take to wife a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
nor impugne the Chriſtian Doctrine,
nor to take into their Family a Chriſtian to
ſerve as a Servant, or as a Nurſe, nor to be
admitted a witneſs againſt any Chriſtian, nor
be ſeen abroad on the day of our Saviours
Paſſion, nor to take any Uſury of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.
Alſo that every <hi>Saturday</hi> Afternoon,
they ſhall be obliged to ſend one out of each
Family of the Jews to a Chriſtian Sermon
appointed for them onely, to the end that
they may be converted to the Chriſtian
Faith, or at leaſt be convinced of the Truth
informed of the reaſonableneſs thereof, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
and beyond all other Religions in the
world.</p>
            <p>LIII. That by an Act of Parliament, or
by a Canon of the Convocation, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
erroneous and defective, may for the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40842:22"/>
future be rendred more regular and perfect.
For in the <hi>Julian</hi> or <hi>Engliſh</hi> Account, (by
reaſon of the no allowance made for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
eleven minutes every year ſince the
year of Chriſt 532.) the year with all its
Feſtivals hath been brought back about ten
days, and thereby cauſed a notable ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity,
more eſpecially in the obſervation
of the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> (which for Antiquity
and Authority yeelds not (as Learned Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
affirm) to our <hi>Sunday</hi> or <hi>Lords day</hi>)
for whereas by the Primitive inſtitution,
after a long and hot contention between the
<hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Weſtern</hi> Churches; about the
time only of obſerving Eaſter, that Feaſt
was at length by Decree of a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
ordered to be obſerved for ever on the
Sunday following, the Firſt Full Moon
after the Vernal Equinox, (and not on the
day of the ſaid Full Moon, as the <hi>Jews</hi>
ever have obſerved their Paſsover) now
according to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> there
falls ſometimes two Full Moons between the
Vernal Equinox and <hi>Eaſter-day:</hi> Nay, (which
is too great an abſurdity to be ſuffered in
any Chriſtian Church) two <hi>Eaſters</hi> will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40842:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be obſerved in one year, and none in the
next. As in this very year of 1667. one <hi>Eaſter</hi>
hath already been obſerved on the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of
<hi>April</hi> laſt paſt, and before our Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to write 1668. that is to ſay before
the 25 of <hi>March</hi> next, there will happen
another <hi>Eaſter, viz.</hi> upon the 22 of <hi>March</hi>
next; and then from the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> 1668.
to the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> 1669. there will not
any <hi>Eaſter</hi> at all be obſerved in <hi>England,</hi>
according to the preſent Rule, whereby is
guided the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Computation.</p>
