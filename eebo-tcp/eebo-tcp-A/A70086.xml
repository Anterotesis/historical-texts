            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  </byline>
                  <p>ON the Nineteenth day of <hi>March</hi> laſt I went to <hi>Salem</hi> Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and lodged at <hi>Nathaniel Ingerſol</hi>'s near to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Mr. <hi>P</hi>'s. Houſe, and preſently after I came into my Lodging, Capt. <hi>Walcut</hi>'s Daughter <hi>Mary</hi> came to Lieut. <hi>Ingerſol</hi>'s and ſpake to me; but ſuddenly after, as ſhe ſtood by the Door, was bitten, ſo that ſhe cryed out of her Wriſt, and looking on it with a Candle, we ſaw apparently the marks of <hi>Teeth,</hi> both upper and lower ſet, on each ſide of her Wriſt.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of the Evening I went to give Mr. <hi>P.</hi> a Viſit. When I was there, his Kinſwoman, <hi>Abigail Williams,</hi> (about 12 Years of Age) had a grievous fit; ſhe was at firſt hurried with violence to and fro in the Room (though Mrs. <hi>Ingerſol</hi> endeavoured to hold her) ſometimes making as if ſhe would fly, ſtretching up her Arms as high as ſhe could, and crying, <hi>Whiſh, Whiſh, Whiſh,</hi> ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times; preſently after ſhe ſaid, there wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Goodw. <hi>N.</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Do you not ſee her? Why there ſhe ſtands!</hi> And ſhe ſaid, Goodw. <hi>N.</hi> offered her <hi>THE BOOK,</hi> but ſhe was reſolved ſhe would not take it, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often, <hi>I wont, I wont, I wont take it, I do not know what Book it is: I am ſure it is none of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s Book, it is the Devil's Book for ought I know.</hi> After that, ſhe run to the Fire, and begun to throw Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands about the Houſe, and run againſt the Back, as if ſhe would run up Chimney, and, as they ſaid, ſhe had attempted to go into the Fire in other Fits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:57317:3"/>On Lords Day, the Twentieth of <hi>March,</hi> there were ſundry of the afflicted Perſons at Meeting, as, Mrs. <hi>Pope,</hi> and Goodwife <hi>Bibber, Abigail Williams, Mary Walcut, Mary Lewes,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Grigg</hi>'s Maid. There was alſo at Meeting, Goodwife <hi>C.</hi> (who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Examined on ſuſpicion of being a <hi>Witch:</hi>) They had ſeveral ſore Fits in the time of Publick Worſhip, which did ſomething in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt me in my firſt Prayer, being ſo unuſual. After <hi>Pſalm</hi> was ſung, <hi>Abigail Williams</hi> ſaid to me, <hi>Now ſtand up, and name your Text!</hi> And after it was read, ſhe ſaid, <hi>It is a long Text.</hi> In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Sermon, Mrs. <hi>Pope,</hi> a Woman afflicted, ſaid to me, <hi>Now there is enough of that.</hi> And in the Afternoon, <hi>Abigail Williams,</hi> upon my referring to my <hi>Doctrine,</hi> ſaid to me, <hi>I know no Doctrine you had, If you did name one, I have forgot it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Sermon time, when Goodwife <hi>C.</hi> was preſent in the Meeting-Houſe, <hi>Ab. W.</hi> called out, <hi>Look where Goodwife</hi> C. <hi>ſits on the Beam ſuckling her Yellow Bird betwixt her fingers! Ann Putman,</hi> another Girle afflicted, ſaid, <hi>There was a Yellow Bird ſat on my Hat as it hung on the Pin in the Pulpit;</hi> but thoſe that were by, reſtrained her from ſpeaking loud about it.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> the <hi>21st.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> the Magiſtrates of <hi>Salem</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to come to Examination of Goodwife <hi>C.</hi> And about Twelve of the Clock they went into the Meeting-Houſe, which was thronged with Spectators. Mr. <hi>Noyes</hi> began with a very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent and pathetical <hi>Prayer;</hi> and Goodwife <hi>C.</hi> being called to anſwer to what was alledged againſt her, ſhe deſired to go to <hi>Prayer,</hi> which was much wondred at, in the preſence of ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred People: The Magiſtrates told her, they would not admit it; they came not there to hear her Pray, but to Examine her, in what was Alledged againſt her. The Worſhipful Mr. <hi>Hathorne</hi> asked her, <hi>Why ſhe afflicted thoſe Children?</hi> She ſaid, ſhe did not Afflict them. He asked her, who did then? She ſaid, <hi>I do not know; How ſhould I know?</hi> The Number of the Afflicted Perſons were about that time Ten, <hi>viz.</hi> Four Married Women, Mrs. <hi>Pope,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Putman,</hi> Goodwife <hi>Bibber,</hi> and an Ancient Woman, named <hi>Goodall;</hi> three Maids, <hi>Mary Walcut, Mercy Lewes,</hi> at <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Putman</hi>'s, and a Maid at Dr. <hi>Griggs</hi>'s; there were three Girls from 9 to 12 Years of Age, each of them, or thereabouts, <hi>viz. Elizabeth Parris, Abigail Williams,</hi> and <hi>Ann Putman;</hi> theſe were moſt of them at Goodwife C's. Examination, and did vehemently
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57317:3"/>
Accuſe her in the Aſſembly of Afflicting them, by <hi>Biting, Pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Strangling, &amp;c.</hi> And that they did in their Fits ſee her Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs coming to them, and bringing a <hi>Book</hi> to them; ſhe ſaid, ſhe had no <hi>Book;</hi> they affirmed, ſhe had a <hi>Yellow Bird,</hi> that uſed to ſuck betwixt her Fingers, and being asked about it, if ſhe had any <hi>Familiar Spirit,</hi> that attended her? ſhe ſaid, <hi>She had no Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with any ſuch thing.</hi> She was a <hi>Goſpel Woman:</hi> Which Title ſhe called her ſelf by; and the Afflicted Perſons told her, Ah! ſhe was <hi>A Goſpel Witch. Ann Putman</hi> did there affirm, that one day when Lieutenant <hi>Fuller</hi> was at Prayer at her Father's Houſe, ſhe ſaw the ſhape of Goodwife <hi>C.</hi> and ſhe thought Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife <hi>N.</hi> Praying at the ſame time to the Devil; ſhe was not ſure it was Goodwife <hi>N.</hi> ſhe thought it was; but very ſure ſhe ſaw the ſhape of Goodwife <hi>C.</hi> The ſaid <hi>C.</hi> ſaid, they were poor diſtracted Children, and no heed to be given to what they ſaid. Mr. <hi>Hathorne</hi> and Mr. <hi>Noyes</hi> replyed, It was the Judgment of all that were preſent, they were <hi>Bewitched,</hi> and only ſhe the Accuſed Perſon ſaid, they were <hi>Diſtracted.</hi> It was obſerved ſeveral times, that if ſhe did but bite her under lip in time of Examination, the Perſons afflicted were bitten on their Arms and Wriſts, and produced the <hi>Marks</hi> before the Magiſtrates, Miniſters, and others. And being watched for that, if ſhe did but <hi>Pinch</hi> her Fingers, or <hi>Graſp</hi> one Hand hard in another, they were Pinched, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the <hi>Marks</hi> before the Magiſtrates, and Spectators. After that, it was obſerved, that if ſhe did but lean her <hi>Breaſt</hi> againſt the Seat in the Meeting-Houſe, (being the <hi>Bar</hi> at which ſhe ſtood) they were afflicted. Particularly Mrs. <hi>Pope</hi> complained of grievous Torment in her <hi>Bowels,</hi> as if they were torn out. She vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently accuſed the ſaid <hi>C.</hi> as the Inſtrument, and firſt threw her Muff at her; but that flying not home, ſhe got off her <hi>Shoe,</hi> and hit Goodwife <hi>C.</hi> on the Head with it. After theſe Poſtures were watched, if the ſaid <hi>C.</hi> did but ſtir her Feet, they were afflicted in their <hi>Feet,</hi> and ſtamped fearfully. The afflicted Perſons asked her, why ſhe did not go to the Company of Witches which were before the Meeting-Houſe Muſtering? Did ſhe not hear the <hi>Drum</hi> beat? They accuſed her of having Familiarity with the <hi>Devil,</hi> in the time of Examination, in the ſhape of a Black <hi>Man</hi> whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering in her Ear; they affirmed, that her <hi>Yellow Bird</hi> ſucked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt her Fingers in the Aſſembly; and Order being given to ſee
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57317:4"/>
if there were any ſign, the Girl that ſaw it, ſaid, it was too late now; ſhe had removed a <hi>Pin,</hi> and put it on her <hi>Head;</hi> which was found <hi>there</hi> ſticking upright.</p>
                  <p>They told her, ſhe had Covenanted with the <hi>Devil</hi> for ten Years, ſix of them were gone, and four more to come. She was required by the Magiſtrates to anſwer that Queſtion in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm, <hi>How many perſons be there in the God-head?</hi> She anſwered it but oddly, yet was there no great thing to be gathered from it; ſhe denied all that was charged upon her, and ſaid, <hi>They could not prove a Witch;</hi> ſhe was that Afternoon Committed to <hi>Salem</hi>-Priſon; and after ſhe was in Cuſtody, ſhe did not ſo appear to them, and afflict them as before.</p>
                  <p>On Wedneſday the <hi>23d.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> I went to <hi>Thomas Putman</hi>'s, on purpoſe to ſee his Wife: I found her lying on the Bed, having had a ſore Fit a little before; ſhe ſpake to me, and ſaid, ſhe was glad to ſee me; her Husband and ſhe both deſired me to Pray with her while ſhe was ſenſible; which I did, though the Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition ſaid, <hi>I ſhould not go to Prayer.</hi> At the firſt beginning ſhe attended; but after a little time, was taken with a Fit; yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſilent, and ſeemed to be <hi>Aſleep:</hi> When Prayer was done, her Husband going to her, found her in a <hi>Fit;</hi> he took her off the Bed, to ſet her on his Knees, but at firſt ſhe was ſo ſtiff, ſhe could not be bended; but ſhe afterwards ſat down, but quickly began to ſtrive violently with her <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Leggs;</hi> ſhe then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to Complain of, and as it were to Converſe Perſonally with, Goodwife <hi>N.</hi> ſaying, <hi>Goodwife</hi> N. <hi>Be gone! Be gone! Be gone! are you not aſhamed, a Woman of your Profeſſion, to afflict a poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo? What hurt did I ever do you in my life? You have but two Years to live, and then the Devil will torment your Soul; for this your Name is blotted out of God's Book, and it ſhall never be put in God's Book again; be gone for ſhame, are you not afraid of that which is coming upon you? I know, I know what will make you afraid; the wrath of an Angry God, I am ſure that will make you afraid; be gone, do not torment me, I know what you would have</hi> (we judged ſhe meant, <hi>her Soul) but it is out of your reach; it is cloathed with the white Robes of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs.</hi> After this, ſhe ſeemed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with the Apparition about a particular <hi>Text</hi> of Scripture. The Apparition ſeemed to deny it; (the Womans Eyes being faſt cloſed all this time) ſhe ſaid, <hi>She was ſure there was ſuch a Text,</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:57317:4"/>
and ſhe would tell it; and then the Shape would be gone, for, ſaid ſhe, <hi>I am ſure you cannot ſtand before that Text!</hi> Then ſhe was ſorely Afflicted, her Mouth drawn on one ſide, and her Body ſtrained for about a Minute, and then ſaid, <hi>I will tell, I will tell; it is, it is, it is,</hi> three or four times, and then was afflicted to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her from telling, at laſt ſhe broke forth, and ſaid, <hi>It is the third Chapter of the Revelations.</hi> I did ſomething ſcruple the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and did let my ſcruple appear, leſt Satan ſhould make any Superſtitiouſly to improve the Word of the Eternal God. However, tho' not verſed in theſe things, I judged I might do it this once for an Experiment. I began to <hi>read,</hi> and before I had near read through the firſt Verſe, ſhe opened her Eyes, and was well; this Fit continued near half an hour. Her Husband and the Spectators told me, ſhe had often been ſo relieved by reading Texts that ſhe named, ſomething pertinent to her Caſe; as <hi>Iſa. 40. 1. Iſa. 49. 1. Iſa.</hi> 50. 1. and ſeveral others.</p>
                  <p>On Thurſday the Twenty Fourth of <hi>March,</hi> (being in courſe the Lecture-Day at the Village) Goodwife <hi>N.</hi> was brought before the Magiſtrates Mr. <hi>Hathorne</hi> and Mr. <hi>Corwin,</hi> about Ten of the Clock in the Forenoon, to be Examined in the Meeting-Houſe, the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Mr. <hi>Hale</hi> begun with Prayer, and the Warrant being read, ſhe was required to give Anſwer, <hi>Why ſhe afflicted thoſe perſons?</hi> She pleaded her own Innocency with earneſtneſs. <hi>Thomas Putman</hi>'s Wife, <hi>Abigail Williams,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Putman</hi>'s Daughter accuſed her that ſhe appeared to them, and afflicted them in their Fits: but ſome of the others ſaid, that they had ſeen her, but knew not that ever ſhe had hurt them; amongſt which was <hi>Mary Walcut,</hi> who was preſently after ſhe had ſo declared bitten, and cryed out of her in the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Houſe, producing the <hi>Marks</hi> of <hi>Teeth</hi> on her wriſt. It was ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that I had not leiſure to attend the whole time of Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but both Magiſtrates and Miniſters told me, that the things alledged by the afflicted, and defences made by her, were much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner as the former was. And her motions did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce like effects, as to <hi>Biting, Pinching, Bruſing, Tormenting,</hi> at their <hi>Breaſts,</hi> by her <hi>Leaning,</hi> and when bended back, were as if their Backs were broken. The afflicted Perſons ſaid, the <hi>Black Man</hi> whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered to her in the Aſſembly, and therefore ſhe could not hear what the Magiſtrates ſaid unto her. They ſaid alſo, that ſhe did then ride by the Meeting-Houſe, behind the <hi>Black Man. Thomas Putman</hi>'s Wife had a grievous Fit in the time of Examination, to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57317:5"/>
the very great impairing of her ſtrength, and waſting of her ſpirits, inſomuch as ſhe could hardly move hand or foot when ſhe was carried out. Others alſo were there grievouſly afflicted, ſo that there was once ſuch an hideous ſcriecth and noiſe (which I heard as I walked at a little diſtance from the Meeting-Houſe) as did amaze me, and ſome that were within, told me the whole Aſſembly was ſtruck with Conſternation, and they were afraid, that thoſe that ſate next to them were under the Influence of <hi>Witchcraft.</hi> This Woman alſo was that day committed to <hi>Salem</hi> Priſon. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and Miniſters alſo did inform me, that they apprehended a Child of <hi>Sarah G.</hi> and examined it, being between 4 and 5 years of Age. And as to matter of Fact, they did unanimouſly affirm, that when this <hi>Child</hi> did but caſt its Eye upon the afflicted Perſons, they were tormented; and they held her <hi>Head,</hi> and yet ſo many as her <hi>Eye</hi> cold ſix upon were afflicted. Which they did ſeveral times make careful Obſervation of: The afflicted complained, they had often been <hi>Bitten</hi> by this Child, and produced the marks of <hi>a ſmall ſet of teeth</hi> accordingly; this was alſo committed to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> Priſon, the Child looked <hi>hail, and well</hi> as other Children. I ſaw it at Lieut. <hi>Ingerſol</hi>'s. After the Commitment of Goodw. <hi>N. Tho. Putman</hi>'s Wife was much better, and had no violent Fits at all from that <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> to the <hi>5th.</hi> of <hi>April.</hi> Some others alſo ſaid they had not ſeen her ſo frequently appear to them, to hurt them.</p>
                  <p>On the <hi>25th.</hi> of <hi>March</hi> (as Capt. <hi>Stephen Sewal</hi> of <hi>Salem</hi> did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards inform me) <hi>Eliz. Paris</hi> had ſore Fits at his Houſe, which much troubled <hi>himſelf, and his Wife,</hi> ſo as he told me they were almoſt diſcouraged. She related, that the great <hi>Black Man</hi> came to her, and told her, if ſhe would be ruled by him, ſhe ſhould have what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhe deſired, and go to a <hi>Golden City.</hi> She relating this to Mrs. <hi>Sewal,</hi> ſhe told the Child, it was the <hi>Devil,</hi> and he was a <hi>Lyar from the Beginning,</hi> and bid her tell him ſo, if he came again: which ſhe did accordingly, at the next coming to her, in her Fits.</p>
                  <p>On the <hi>26th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hathorne,</hi> Mr. <hi>Corwin,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Higiſon,</hi> were at the Priſon-Keeper's Houſe to Examine the Child, and it told them there, it had a little <hi>Snake</hi> that uſed to ſuck on the loweſt Joynt of its Fore-Finger; and when they enquired where, pointing to other places, it told them, not there, but <hi>there,</hi> pointing on the loweſt Joint of the Fore-Finger, where they obſerved a deep Red Spot, about the bigneſs of a <hi>Flea-bite;</hi> they asked who gave it that <hi>Snake?</hi> whether the great Black Man? It ſaid no, its Mother gave it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:57317:5"/>The 31 of <hi>March</hi> there was a <hi>Publick Faſt</hi> kept at <hi>Salem</hi> on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of theſe Afflicted Perſons. And <hi>Abigal Williams</hi> ſaid, that the Witches had a <hi>Sacrament</hi> that day at an houſe in the Village, and that they had <hi>Red Bread</hi> and <hi>Red Drink.</hi> The firſt of <hi>April, Mercy Lewis, Thomas Putman</hi>'s Maid, in her Fit, ſaid, they did eat <hi>Red Bread,</hi> like <hi>Man's Fleſh,</hi> and would have had her eat ſome &amp; but ſhe would not; but turned away her head, and ſpit at them, and ſaid, <hi>I will not Eat, I will not Drink, it is Blood,</hi> &amp;c. ſhe ſaid, <hi>That is not the Bread of Life; that is not the Water of Life; Chriſt gives the Bread of Life; I will have none of it!</hi> The firſt of <hi>April</hi> alſo <hi>Marcy Lewis</hi> aforeſaid ſaw in her Fit a <hi>VVhite Man,</hi> and was with him in a glorious Place, which had no <hi>Candles</hi> nor <hi>Sun,</hi> yet was full of Light and <hi>Brightneſs;</hi> where was a great Multitude in White glittering Robes, and they Sung the Song in the fifth of <hi>Revelation,</hi> the 9th verſe, and the 110 <hi>Pſalm</hi> and the 149 <hi>Pſalm;</hi> and ſaid with her ſelf, <hi>How long ſhall I ſtay here! let me be along with you:</hi> She was loth to leave this place, and grieved that ſhe could tarry no longer. This <hi>white Man</hi> hath appeared ſeveral times to ſome of them, and given them notice how long it ſhould be before they had another Fit, which was ſometimes a day, or day and half, or more or leſs, it hath fallen out accordingly.</p>
                  <p>The 3d of <hi>April,</hi> the Lord's-day, being Sacrament-day, at the Village, <hi>Goodw. C.</hi> upon Mr. <hi>Parris</hi>'s naming his Text, <hi>John 6, 70.

                     <head>Remarks of things more than ordinary about the Afflicted Perſons.</head>
                     <item>1. They are in their Fits tempted to be <hi>VVitches,</hi> are ſhewed the Liſt of the Names of others, and are tortured, becauſe they will not yeild to Subſcribe, or meddle with, or touch the BOOK, and are promiſed to have preſent Relief if they would do it.</item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57317:6"/>2. They did in the Aſſembly mutually <hi>Cure</hi> each other, even with a <hi>Touch</hi> of their Hand, when Strangled, and otherwiſe Tortured; and would endeavour to get to their Afflicted, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them.</item>
                     <item>3. They did alſo foretel when anothers Fit was a-coming, and would ſay, <hi>Look to her!</hi> ſhe will have a Fit preſently, which fell out accordingly, as many can bear witneſs, that heard and ſaw it.</item>
                     <item>4. That at the ſame time, when the <hi>Accuſed</hi> Perſon was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the <hi>Afflicted Perſons</hi> ſaw her Likeneſs in other places of the Meeting-Houſe, ſuckling her <hi>Familiar,</hi> ſometimes in one place and poſture, and ſometimes in another.</item>
                     <item>5. That their Motions in their Fits are <hi>Preternatural,</hi> both as to the manner, which is ſo ſtrange as a well perſon could not Screw their Body into; &amp; as to the violence alſo it is preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural being much beyond the Ordinary force of the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon when they are in their right mind.</item>
                     <item>6. The <hi>eyes</hi> of ſome of them in their fits are exceeding faſt cloſed, and if you ask a queſtion they can give no anſwer, and I do believe they cannot hear at that time, yet do they plainely converſe with the Appearances, as if they did diſcourſe with real perſons.</item>
                     <item>7 They are utterly preſſed againſt any perſons <hi>Praying</hi> with them, and told by the appearances, they ſhall not go to <hi>Prayer,</hi> ſo <hi>Tho. Putmans</hi> wife was told, <hi>I ſhould not Pray;</hi> but ſhe ſaid, <hi>I ſhould:</hi> and after I had done, reaſoned with the <hi>Appearance, Did not I ſay he ſhould go to Prayer.</hi>

                     </head>
                     <item>1 For introduction to the diſcovery of thoſe that afflicted them It is reported Mr. <hi>Parris's</hi> Indian Man, and Woman, made a Cake of <hi>Rye Meal,</hi> and the Childrens water, baked it in the Aſhes, and gave it to a Dog, ſince which they have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and ſeen particular perſons hurting of them.</item>
                     <item>2 In Time of Examination, they ſeemed little affected, though all the Spectators were much grieved to ſee it.</item>
                     <item>3 <hi>Natural</hi> Actions in them produced <hi>Preternatural</hi> actions in the Afflicted, ſo that they are their own <hi>Image</hi> without any <hi>Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits</hi> of Wax or otherwiſe.</item>

                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:57317:6"/>4. That they are accuſed to have a Company about 23 or 24 and they did <hi>Muſter in Armes,</hi> as it ſeemed to the Afflicted Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</item>
                     <item>5. Since they were confined, the Perſons have not been ſo much Afflicted with their appearing to them, <hi>Biteing</hi> or <hi>Pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of them &amp;c.</item>
                     <item>6. They are reported by the Afflicted Perſons to keep dayes of <hi>Faſt</hi> and dayes of <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> and <hi>Sacraments;</hi> Satan en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to Transforme himſelf to an <hi>Angel of Light,</hi> and to make his Kingdom and Adminiſtrations to reſemble thoſe of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</item>
                     <item>7. Satan Rages Principally amongſt the Viſible Subjects of Chriſt's Kingdom and makes uſe (at leaſt in appearance) of ſome of them to Afflict others; that <hi>Chriſt's Kingdom may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt it ſelf,</hi> and ſo be weakened.</item>
                     <item>8. Several things uſed in <hi>England</hi> at Tryal of Witches, to the Number of 14 or 15 which are wont to paſs inſtead of, or in Concurrence with <hi>VVitneſſes,</hi> at leaſt 6 or 7 of them are found in theſe accuſed ſee <hi>Keebles Statutes.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>9. Some of the moſt ſolid Afflicted Perſons do affirme the ſame things concerning <hi>ſeeing</hi> the accuſed <hi>out</hi> of their Fitts as well as <hi>in</hi> them.</item>
                     <item>10. The Witches had a <hi>Faſt,</hi> and told one of the Afflicted Girles, ſhe muſt not <hi>Eat,</hi> becauſe it was <hi>Faſt Day,</hi> ſhe ſaid, ſhe <hi>would:</hi> they told her they would <hi>Choake</hi> her then; which when ſhe did eat, was endeavoured.</item>

                  </head>
                  <p>HEre were in <hi>Salem, June</hi> 10. 1692. about 40 perſons that were afflicted with horrible torments by <hi>Evil Spirits,</hi> and the afflicted have accuſed 60 or 70 as Witches, for that they have <hi>Spectral appearances</hi> of them, tho the Perſons are abſent when they are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. When theſe Witches were Tryed, ſeveral of them confeſſed a contract with the Devil, by ſigning his Book, and did expreſs much ſorrow for the ſame, delare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo thir <hi>Confederate Witches,</hi> and ſaid the Tempters of them deſired 'em to ſign the <hi>Devils Book,</hi> who tormented them till they did it. There were at the time of <hi>Examination,</hi> before many hundreds of Witneſſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtrange Pranks play'd; ſuch as the taking Pins out of the Clothes of the afflicted, and thruſting them into their fleſh, many of which were taken out again by the <hi>Judges</hi> own hands. Thorns alſo in like kind were thruſt into their fleſh; the accuſers were ſometimes <hi>ſtruck dumb, deaf, blind,</hi> and ſometimes lay as if they were dead for a while, and all foreſeen and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

by the afflicted juſt before 'twas done. Of the afflicted there were two Girls, about 12 <hi>or 13 years of age,</hi> who ſaw all that was done, and were therefore called the <hi>Viſionary Girls;</hi> they would ſay, <hi>Now he, or ſhe, or they, are going to bite,</hi> or <hi>pinch the Indian;</hi> and all there preſent in Court ſaw the viſible marks on the <hi>Indians</hi> arms; they would alſo cry out, <hi>Now look, look, they are going to bind ſuch an ones Legs,</hi> and all preſent ſaw the ſame perſon ſpoken of, fall with her Legs twiſted in an extraordinary manner; Now ſay they, we ſhall all fall, and immediately 7 or 8 of the afflicted fell down, with <hi>terrible ſhrieks and Out-crys:</hi> at the time when one of the Witches was <hi>ſentenc'd, and pinnim'd</hi> with a Cord, at the ſame time was the afflicted <hi>Indian</hi> Servant going home, (being about 2 or 3 miles out of town,) and had both his Wriſts at the ſame inſtant bound about with a like Cord, in the ſame manner as ſhe was when ſhe was ſentenc'd, but with that violence, that the Cord entred into his fleſh, not to be untied, nor hardly cut—Many <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> are ſuppos'd to be in this way committed; for theſe Girls, and others of the afflicted, ſay, <hi>they ſee Coffins, and bodies in Shrowds,</hi> riſing up, and looking on the accuſed, crying, <hi>Vengeance. Vengeance on the Murderers</hi>—Many other ſtrange things were tranſacted before the Court in the time of their Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and eſpecially one thing which I had like to have forgot, which is this, One of the accus'd, whilſt the reſt were under Examination, was drawn up by a Rope to the Roof of the houſe where he was, and would have been choak'd in all probability, had not the Rope been preſently cut; the Rope hung at the Roof by ſome <hi>inviſibletye.</hi> for there was no hole where it went up; but after it was cut the <hi>remainder</hi> of it was found in the Chamber juſt above, lying by the very place where it hung down.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>December</hi> 1692, the Court ſate again at <hi>Salem</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> and cleared about 40 perſons ſuſpected for Witches, and Condemned three. The Evidence againſt theſe three was the ſame as formerly, ſo the Warrant for their Execution was ſent, and the <hi>Graves digged</hi> for the ſaid three, and for about five more that had been Condemned at <hi>Salem</hi> formerly, but were Repreived by the Governour.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of <hi>February</hi> 1693. the Court ſate at <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> where the Judge expreſt himſelf to this effect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That who it was that obſtructed the Execution of Juſtice, or hindred thoſe good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings they had made, he knew not, but thereby the Kingdom of Satan was advanc'd,</hi> &amp;c <hi>and the Lord have mercy on this Country;</hi> and ſo declined coming any more into Court. In his abſence <hi>Mr. D</hi>—ſate as Chief Judge 3 ſeveral days, in which time 5 or 6 were clear'd by Proclamation, and almoſt as many by Trial; ſo that all are acquitted.</p>
                  <p>The moſt remarkable was an Old Woman named <hi>Dayton,</hi> of whom it was ſaid, <hi>If any in the World were a Witch, ſhe was one, and had been ſo accounted 30 years.</hi> I had the Curioſity to ſee her tried; ſhe was a decrepid Woman of about 80 years of age, and did not uſe many words in her own defence. She was accuſed by about 30 Witneſſes; but the matter alledged againſt her was ſuch as needed little apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, on her part not one paſſionate word, or immoral action, or evil, was then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt her for 20 years paſt, only ſtrange accidents falling out, after ſome Chriſtian admonition given by her, as ſaying, <hi>God would not proſper them, if they wrong'd the Widow.</hi> Upon the whole, there was not prov'd againſt her any thing worthy of Reproof, or juſt admonition, much leſs ſo heinous a Charge.</p>
                  <p>So that by the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God we are once more out of preſent danger of this <hi>Hobgoblin Monster;</hi> the ſtanding Evidence uſed at <hi>Salem</hi> were called. but did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                  <p>There were others alſo at <hi>Charles-town</hi> brought upon their <hi>Tryals,</hi> who had formerly confeſs'd themſelves to be Witches; but upon their tryals deny'd it, and were all clear'd; So that at preſent there is no <hi>further proſecution of any.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>SO</hi> Odious and Abominable is the Name of a Witch, to the Civilized, much more the Religious part of Mankind, that it is apt to grow up into a Scandal for any, ſo much as to enter ſome ſober cautions againſt the over haſty ſuſpecting, or too precipitant Judging of Perſons on this account. But certainly, the more execrable the Crime is, the more critical care is to be uſed in the expoſing of the Names, Liberties, and Lives of Men (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of a Godly Converſation) to the imputation of it. The awful hand of God now upon us, in letting looſe of evil Angels among us to perpretate ſuch horrid Miſchiefs, and ſuffering of Hell's Inſtruments to do ſuch fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things as have been ſcarce heard of; hath put ſerious perſons into deep Muſings, and upon curious Enquiries what is to be done for the detecting and defeating of this tremendous deſign of the grand Adverſary: And, tho' all that fear God are agreed, <hi>That no evil is to be done, that good may come of it;</hi> yet hath the Devil obtained not a little of his deſign, in the diviſions of Reuben, about the application of this Rule.</p>
                  <p>That there are Devils and Witches, the Scripture aſſerts, and experience confirms, That they are common enemies of Mankind, and ſet upon miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, is not to be doubted: That the Devil can (by Divine Permiſſion) and often doth vex men in Body and Eſtate, without the Inſtrumentality of Witches, is undeniable: That he often hath, and delights to have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of Witches, and their conſent in harming men, is conſonant to his native Malice to Man, and too lamentably exemplified: That Witches, when detected and convinced, ought to be exterminated and cut off, we have God's warrant for, <hi>Exod. 22. 18.</hi> Only the ſame God who hath ſaid, <hi>thou ſhalt not ſuffer a Witch to live;</hi> hath alſo ſaid, <hi>at the Mouth of two Witneſſes, or three Witneſſes ſhall he that is worthy of Death, be put to Death: But at the Mouth of one Witneſs, he ſhall not be put to Death,</hi> Deut. 17. 6. Much debate is made about <hi>what is</hi> ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Conviction, and ſome have (in their Zeal) ſuppoſed that a leſs clear evidence ought to paſs in this than in other Caſes, ſuppoſing that elſe it will be hard (if poſſible) to bring ſuch to condign Puniſhment, by reaſon of the cloſe conveyances that there are between the Devil and Witches; but this is a very dangerous and unjuſtifiable tenet. Men ſerve God in doing their Duty, he never intended that all perſons guilty of Capital Crimes ſhould be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and puniſhed by men in this Life, though they be never ſo curious in ſearching after Iniquity. It is therefore exceeding neceſſary that in ſuch a day as this, men be informed what is Evidence and what is not. It concerns men in point of Charity; for tho' the most ſhining Profeſſor may be ſecretly a most abominable Sinner, yet till he be detected, our Charity is bound to Judge according to what appears: and notwithſtanding that a clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence muſt determine a caſe; yet preſumptions muſt be weighed againſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions,
<pb facs="tcp:57317:9"/>
and Charity is not to be forgone as long as it has the moſt prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating on its ſide. And it is of no leſs neceſſity in point of Juſtice; there are not only Teſtimonies required by God, which are to be credited according to the Rules given in his Word referring to witneſſes: But there is alſo an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſuppoſed to be in the Teſtimony, which is throughly to be weighed, and if it do not infallibly prove the Crime againſt the perſon accuſed, it ought not to determine him guilty of it; for ſo a righteous Man may be Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unjuſtly. In the caſe of Witchcrafts we know that the Devil is the immediate Agent in the Miſchief done, the conſent or compact of the Witch is the thing to be Demonſtrated.</p>
                  <p>Among many Arguments to evince this, that which is moſt under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent debate, is that which refers to ſomething vulgarly called <hi>Spectre E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> and a certain ſort of <hi>Ordeal</hi> or trial by the ſight and touch. The principal Plea to juſtifie the convictive Evidence in theſe, is fetcht from the Conſideration of the Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs of God in Governing the World, which they ſuppoſe would fail, if ſuch things were permitted to befal an innocent perſon: but it is certain, that too reſolute concluſions drawn from hence, are bold uſurpations upon ſpotleſs <hi>Sovereignty:</hi> and tho' ſome thing if ſuffered to be common, would ſubvert this Government, and disband, yea ruine Humane Society; yet God doth ſometimes ſuffer ſuch things to evene, that we may thereby know how much we are beholden to him, for that reſtraint which he lays upon the Infernal Spirits, who would elſe reduce a World into a Chaos. That the Reſolutions of ſuch Caſes as theſe is proper for the Servants of Chriſt in the Miniſtry cannot be denied; the ſeaſonableneſs of doing it now, will be juſtified by the Conſideration of the neceſſity there is at this time of a right Information of mens Judgments about theſe things, and the danger of their being miſinformed.</p>
                  <p>The Reverend, Learned, and Judicious Author of the enſuing Caſes, is too well known to need our Commendation: All that we are concerned in, is to <hi>aſſert our hearty Conſent to, and Concurrence with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what is contained in the following Diſcourſe:</hi> And, with our hearty Requeſt to God, that he would diſcover the depths of this Helliſh Deſign; direct in the whole management of this Affair; prevent the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any wrong ſteps in this dark way; and that he would in particular Bleſs theſe faithful Endeavours of his Servant to that end, we Commend it and you to his Divine Benediction.</p>

                  <p>THE Firſt Caſe that I am deſired to expreſs my Judgment in, is this, <hi>Whether it is not Poſſible for the Devil to impoſe on the imaginations of Perſons Bewitched, and to cauſe them to Believe that an Innocent, yea that a Pious perſon does tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them, when the Devil himſelf doth it; or whether Satan may not appear in the Shape of an Innocent and Pious, as well as of a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and Wicked Perſon, to Afflict ſuch as ſuffer by Diabolical Moleſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Anſwer to the Queſtion muſt be Affirmative; Let the following Arguments be duely weighed in the Ballance of the Sanctuary.</p>

                        </gap>mancer,</hi> muſt bow himſelf to him. Moreover, had it been the true <hi>Samuel</hi> from Heaven reprehending <hi>Saul,</hi> there is great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe, that he would not only have reproved him for his ſin, in not executing Judgment on the <hi>Amalekites;</hi> as in Ver. 18. But for his Wickedneſs in conſulting with Familiar Spirits: For which Sin it was in ſpecial that he died, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10. 13. But in as much as there is not one word to teſtify againſt that Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we may conclude that it was not real <hi>Samuel</hi> that appeared to <hi>Saul:</hi> and if it were the Devil in his likeneſs, the Argument ſeems very ſtrong, that if the Devil may appear in the form of a Saint in Glory, much more is it poſſible for him to put on the likeneſs of the moſt Pious and Innocent Saint on Earth. There are, who acknowledge that a <hi>Daemon</hi> may appear in the ſhape of a Godly Perſon, <hi>But not as doing Evil.</hi> Whereas the Devil in <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>'s likeneſs told a pernicious Lye, when he ſaid, <hi>Thou haſt diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me.</hi> It was not in the Power of <hi>Saul,</hi> nor of all the Devils in Hell, to diſquiet a Soul in Heaven, where <hi>Samuel</hi> had been for Two years before this Apparition. Nor did the <hi>Spectre</hi> ſpeak true, when he ſaid, <hi>Thou and thy Sons ſhall be with me:</hi> Tho' <hi>Saul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at his Death went to be with the Devil, his Son <hi>Jonathan</hi> did not ſo. Beſides, (which ſuits with the matter in hand) the Devil in <hi>Samuels</hi> ſhape confirmed <hi>Necromancy</hi> and <hi>Curſed Witchery.</hi> He that can in the likeneſs of Saints encourage Witches to Familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with Hell, may poſſibly in the likeneſs of a Saint afflict a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched Perſon. But this we ſee from Scripture, Satan may be permitted to do.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it is objected, that the Devil may appear indeed in the form of Dead Perſons, but that he cannot repreſent ſuch as are living; The contrary is manifeſt. No Queſtion had <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid to the Witch, bring me <hi>David</hi> who was then living, ſhe could as eaſily have ſhown living <hi>David</hi> as dead <hi>Samuel,</hi> as eaſily as that great Conjurer, of whom <note n="*" place="margin">De Praeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

why he could not anſwer him in the Day as well as in the Night; The Philoſopher profeſſed he was not with him in the Night, only acknowledged that he dreamed of his having ſuch converſation of his Friend, but he was all the time at home, and aſleep. <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> and <hi>Palladius</hi> did both of them profeſs to <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that one in his ſhape, had divers times, and in divers places appeared to them <note n="†" place="margin">De Appar.

                     <hi>Secundellus,</hi> and to another Saint, who ſuſpecting it was Satan, transforming himſelf into an <hi>Angel of Light</hi> had this expreſſion, <hi>If I may ſee Chriſt in Heaven it is enough, I deſire not to ſee him in this World;</hi> whereupon the <hi>Spectre</hi> vaniſhed. It has been related of <hi>Luther,</hi> that after he had been Faſting and Praying in his Study, the Devil come pretending to be Chriſt, but <hi>Luther</hi> ſaying, <hi>away thou confounded Devil, I acknowledge no Chriſt but what is in my Bible,</hi> nothing more was ſeen. Thus then the Devil is able (by Divine Permiſſion) to Change himſelf into what form or figure he pleaſeth,</p>
                  <q>Omnia transformat ſeſe in miracula rerum.</q>
                  <p>A Third Scripture to our purpoſe is that, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 10. where the Devil is called the <hi>Accuſer of the Brethren.</hi> Such is the malice and impudence of the Devil, as that he does accuſe good Men,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57317:11"/>
and that before God, and that not only of ſuch Faults as they really are guilty of, he accuſed <hi>Joſhua</hi> with his filthy Garments, when through his Indulgence ſome of his Family had tranſgreſſed by unlawful Marriages, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. 23. with <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 18. but alſo with ſuch Crimes, as they are altogether free from. He repreſented the Primitive Chriſtians as the vileſt of men, and as if at their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings they did commit the moſt nefandous Villanies that ever were known; and that not only Innocent, but Eminently Pious Perſons ſhould thro' the Malice of the Devil be accuſed with the Crime of Witchcraft, is no new thing. Such an Affliction did the Lord ſee meet to exerciſe the great <hi>Athanaſius</hi> with <note n="t" place="margin">Binsfeild de Confeſs. Sag. <hi>p. 187.</hi>
                     </note> only the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence did wonderfully vindicate him from that as well as from ſome other ſoul Aſperſions. The <hi>Waldenſes</hi> (altho' the Scriptures call them <hi>Saints, Rev.</hi> 13. 7.) have been traduccd by Satan and by the World as horrible Witches; ſo have others in other places, only becauſe they have done extraordinary things by their Prayers: It is by many Authors related, that a City in <hi>France</hi> was moleſted with a Diabolical <hi>Spectre,</hi> which the People were wont to call <hi>Hugon;</hi> near that place a number of Proteſtants were wont to meet to ſerve God, whence the Profeſſors of the true reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were nic<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>named <hi>Hugonots,</hi> by the Papiſts, who deſigned to render them before the World, as the Servants and Worſhippers of that <hi>Daemon,</hi> that went under the name of <hi>Hugon.</hi> And how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten have I read in Books written by Jeſuits, that <hi>Luther</hi> was a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, and that he did himſelf confeſs that he had familiarity with Satan! Moſt impudent Untruths! nor are theſe things to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at, ſince the Holy Son of God himſelf was reputed a <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> and one that had Familiarity with the greateſt of Devils. The Blaſpheming Phariſees ſaid, <hi>he caſts out the Devils thro' the Prince of Devils,</hi> Matth. 9. 34. There is then not the beſt Saint on Earth (Man or Woman) that can aſſure themſelves that the Devil ſhall not caſt ſuch an Imputation upon them. <hi>It is enough for the Diſciple that he be as his Maſter, and the Servant as his Lord: If they have called the Maſter of the Houſe Reelzebub, how much more them of his Houſhold,</hi> Matth. 10. 25. It is not for men to determine how far the holy God may permit the wicked one to proceed in his Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations. The ſacred ſtory of <hi>Job</hi> giveth us to underſtand, that the Lord whoſe ways art paſt finding out, does for wiſe and holy Ends ſuffer Satan by immediate Operation, (and conſequently by Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft) greatly to afflict innocent Perſons, as in their Bodies and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, ſo in their Reputations. I ſhall mention but one Scripture
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57317:12"/>
more to confirm the Truth in hand: It is that in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 2, 3. where it is ſaid, <hi>All things come alike to all, there is one event to the Righteous and to the Wicked, as is the Good, ſo is the Sinner, this is an evil amongſt all things under the Sun, that there is one Event happeneth to all.</hi> And in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 15. 'tis ſaid, <hi>There is a juſt man that periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence we infer, that there is no outward Affliction what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever but may befal a good Man; now to be repreſented by Satan as a Tormentor of Bewitched or Poſſeſſed Perſons, is a ſore Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to a good Man. To be tormented by Satan is a ſore Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, yet nothing but what befel <hi>Job,</hi> and a Daughter of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> whom we read of in the Goſpel: To be repreſented by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan as tormenting others, is an Affliction like the former; the Lord may bring ſuch extraordinary Temptations on his own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to afflict and humble them, for ſome Sin they have been guilty of before him. A moſt wicked Perſon in St. <hi>Ives,</hi> got a Knife, and went with it to a Miniſters Houſe, deſigning to ſtab him, but was diſappointed; afterwards Conſcience being awakened, the Devil appears to this Perſon in the Shape of that Miniſter, with a Knife in his hand exhorting to Self-murder: Was not here a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ſuitable to the Sin which that Perſon had been guilty of? Perhaps ſome of thoſe whom Satan has repreſented as committing Witchcrafts, have been tampering with ſome fooliſh and wicked Sorceries, tho' not to that degree, which is Criminal and Capital by the Laws both of God and Men; for this Satan may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſo to ſcourge them; or it may be, they have miſrepreſented and abuſed others, for which cauſe the Holy God may juſtly give Satan leave falſely to repreſent them.</p>
                  <p>Have we not known ſome that have bitterly cenſured all that have been complained of by bewitched Perſons, ſaying it was impoſſible they ſhould not be guilty; ſoon upon which themſelves or ſome near Relations of theirs, have been to the laſting Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of their Families, been accuſed after the ſame manner, and Perſonated by the Devil! Such tremendous Rebukes on a few, ſhould make all men to be careful how they joyn with Satan in Condemning the Innocent.</p>
                  <p>Arg. 2. <hi>Becauſe it is poſſible for the Devil in the Shape of an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Perſon to do other miſchiefs.</hi> As for thoſe who acknowledge that Satan may perſonate a pious Perſon, but not to do miſchief, their Opinion has been confuted by more than a few unhappy Inſtances.

They that affirm, that God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did, nor ever will permit him thus to do, alledge that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtant with the Righteouſneſs and Providence of God, in governing Humane Affairs thus to ſuffer Men to be impoſed on: It muſt be acknowledged <note n="c" place="margin">In Mr. <hi>Glanvil</hi>'s Philoſophical Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> that the Divine Providence has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken care, that the greateſt part of Mankind ſhall not be left to unavoidable Deception, ſo as to be always abuſed by the miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Agents of Hell, in the Objects of plain Sence: But yet it is not for ſinful and ſilly Mortals to preſcribe Rules to the moſt High in his Government of the World, or to direct him how far he may permit Satan to uſe his power: I am apt to think that there are ſome amongſt us, who if they had lived in <hi>Job</hi>'s days, and ſeen the Devil tormenting of him, and heard him complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of being ſcared with Dreams, and terrified with Night-viſions, they would have joined with his uncharitable Friends in cenſuring him as a moſt guilty Perſon: But we ſhould conſider, that the moſt high God doth ſometimes deal with Men in a way of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Sovereignty, performing the thing which is appointed for them, and many ſuch things are with him: If he does deſtroy the <hi>perfect with the wicked, and laugh at the tryal of the innocent,</hi> (Job. 9. 22, 23.) Who ſhall enter into his Councils! who has given him a Charge over the Earth! or who has diſpoſed the whole World! Men are not able to give an account of his ordinary Works, much leſs of his ſecret Counſels, and the dark Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Providence: They do but darken Counſel by Words without Knowledge when they undertake it: If we are not able to ſee how this or that can ſtand with the Righteouſneſs of him that governs the World, ſhall we ſay that the Almighty will pervert
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57317:14"/>
Judgment? or that he that governs the Earth hateth Right? Shall we condemn him that is moſt juſt? But whereas 'tis objected, where is Providence? And how ſhall Men live on the Earth, if the Devil may be permitted to uſe ſuch Power? I demand, where was Providence, when Satan had Power to cauſe Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> to lye and ſwear away the Life of innocent <hi>Naboth,</hi> laying ſuch Crimes to his charge as he was never guilty of? And what an Hour of Darkneſs was it? How far was the Power of Hell per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to prevail, when Chriſt the Son of God was accuſed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and hanged for a Crime that he never was guilty of? That was the ſtrangeſt Providence that has happened ſince the World began, and yet in the Iſſue the moſt glorious: We muſt therefore diſtinguiſh between what does ordinarily come to paſs by the Providence of God, and things which are extraordinary: It is not an uſual thing for a <hi>Naboth</hi> to have his Life taken from him by falſe Accuſations, or for an <hi>Athanaſius</hi> or a <hi>Suſanna</hi> to be charged, and perhaps brought before Courts of Judicature for Crimes of which they were altogether innocent.</p>
                  <p>But if we therefore conclude, that ſuch a thing as this can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver happen in the World, we ſhall offend againſt the Generation of the Juſt: It is not ordinary for Devils to be permitted to reveal the ſecret Sins of Men; yet this has been done more than once or twice: Nor is it ordinary for <hi>Daemons</hi> to ſteal Money out of Mens Pockets, and Purſes, or Wine and Cyder out of their Cellars. Yet ſome ſuch Inſtances have there been amongſt our ſelves. It is not uſual for Providence to permit the Devil to come from Hell and to throw Fire on the tops of Houſes, and to cauſe a whole Town to be burnt to Aſhes thereby; there would (it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed) be no living in the World, if evil Angels ſhould be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to do thus when they had a mind to it; nevertheleſs, Authors worthy of Credit, tell us, that this has ſometimes happened. <note n="d" place="margin">

                  <p>To proceed, Is it not uſual for Perſons after their Death to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unto the Living: But it does not therefore follow, that the great God will not ſuffer this to be: For both in former and lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ages, Examples thereof have not been wanting: No longer ſince than the laſt Winter, there was much diſcourſe in <hi>London</hi> concerning a Gentlewoman, unto whom her dead Son (and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whom ſhe knew not) had appeared: Being then in <hi>London,</hi> I was willing to ſatisfie my ſelf, by enquiring into the Truth of what was reported; and on <hi>Febr.</hi> 23. 1691. my Brother (who is now a Paſtor to a Congregation in that City) and I diſcourſed the Gentlewoman ſpoken of; ſhe told us, that a Son of hers, who had been a very civil young Man, but more airy in his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per than was pleaſing to his ſerious Mother, being dead, ſhe was much concerned in her Thoughts about his Condition in the other World; but a Fortnight after his Death he appeared to her, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Mother you are ſolicitous about my Spiritual Welfare; trouble your ſelf no more, for I am happy,</hi> and ſo vaniſhed; ſhould there be a continual Intercourſe between the Viſible and Inviſible World, it would breed Confuſion. But from thence to infer, that the great Ruler of the Univerſe will never permit any thing of this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57317:15"/>
nature to be, is an inconſequent Concluſion; it is not uſual for Devils to be permitted to come and violently carry away perſons through the Air, ſeveral miles from their Habitations: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, this was done in <hi>Sweedland</hi> about twenty Years ago, by means of a curſed Knot of Witches there. And a learned Phyſician now living, giveth an account of ſeveral Children, who by Diabolical Frauds were ſtollen from their Parents, and others left in their room: And of two, that in the night-time a Line was by inviſible Hands put about their Necks, with which they had been ſtrangled, but that ſome near them happily prevented it. <hi>V.

                  <p>Let me further add here; It has very ſeldom been known, that Satan has Perſonated innocent Men doing an ill thing, but Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has found out ſome way for their Vindication; either they have been able to prove that they were in another place when that Fact was done, or the like. So that perhaps there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was an Inſtance of any innocent Perſon Condemned in any Court of Judicature on Earth, only through Satans deluding and impoſing on the Imaginations of Men, when nevertheleſs, the Witneſſes, Juries, and Judges, were all to be excuſed from blame.</p>

                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:57317:18"/>I have in another Book given an account concerning <hi>Elizabeth Knap</hi> of <hi>Groton,</hi> who complained that a Woman as eminent for Piety as any in that Town, did appear to her, and afflict her: But afterwards ſhe was ſatisfied that that Perſon never did her any harm, but that the Devil abuſed them both. About two Years ago, a bewitched Perſon in <hi>Chelmsford</hi> in her Fits, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that a worthy good Man, a near Relation of hers did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict her: So did ſhe likewiſe complain of another Perſon in that Town of known Integrity and Piety.</p>
                  <p>I have my ſelf known ſeveral of whom I ought to think that they are now in Heaven, conſidering that they were of good Converſation, and reputed Pious by thoſe that had the greateſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy with them, of whom nevertheleſs, ſome complained that their Shapes appeared to them, and threatned them: Nor is this anſwered by ſaying, we do not know but thoſe Perſons might be Witches: We are bound by the Rule of Charity to think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: And they that cenſure any, meerly becauſe ſuch a ſad Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction as their being falſly repreſented by Satan has befallen them, do not do as they would be done by. I bleſs the Lord, it was never the Portion allotted to me, nor to any Relation of mine to be thus abuſed: But no Man knoweth what may happen to him, ſince <hi>there be juſt Men unto whom it happeneth according to the Work of the Wicked,</hi> Eccleſ. 8. 14. But what needs more to be ſaid, ſince there is one amongſt our ſelves whom no Man that knows him, can think him to be a Wizzard, whom yet ſome bewitched Perſons complained of, that they are in his Shape torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And the Devils have of late accuſed ſome eminent Perſons.</p>
                  <p>It is an awful thing which the Lord has done to convince ſome amongſt us of their Error: This then I declare and teſtifie, that to take away the Life of any one, meerly becauſe a <hi>Spectre</hi> or Devil, in a bewitched or poſſeſſed Perſon does accuſe them, will bring the Guilt of innocent Blood on the Land, where ſuch a thing ſhall be done: Mercy forbid that it ſhould, (and I truſt that as it has not it never will be ſo) in <hi>New-England.</hi> What does ſuch an Evidence amount unto more than this: Either ſuch an one did afflict ſuch an one, or the Devil in his likeneſs, or his Eyes were bewitched.</p>
                  <p>The things which have been mentioned make way for, and bring us unto the ſecond Caſe, which is to come under our Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, <hi>viz.</hi>

Albeit, I cannot deny but this has very often proved true, yet ſeeing the Devil is ſuch an one as you heard, Chriſtian Men ſhould not take his Witneſs, to give in Verdict upon Oath, and ſo ſwear that the Devil has therein ſpoken the Truth; be it far from good men to confirm any Word of the Devil by Oath, if it be not an evident Truth without the Devil's Teſtimony, who in ſpeaking the Truth, has a lying Intent, and ſpeaks ſome Truths of things done, which may be found to be ſo, that he may wrap with them ſome pernicious Lye, which cannot be tried to be true, but muſt reſt upon his own teſtimony to enſnare the Blood of the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</q>

                     <q>No Man can doubt but that the Vertue wherewith this touch was indued, is ſupernatural: If it be ſo, How can Man to whom nothing is ſimply poſſible that is not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural be juſtly reputed an Agent therein? If he cannot be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in himſelf any poſſible or true Agent, then it remaineth that he can only be intereſſed therein as an Acceſſary in Conſent, or as a Servant unto a Superior Power: If that Superior Power be the Devil, the leaſt reaſonable doubt, whether the Devil alone, or with the Conſent or Contract of the ſuſpected Perſon has produced that wonderful effect; with what Religion or Reaſon can any Man incline rather to credit the Devil's mouth in the Bewitched, than to pity the Accuſed, and believe them againſt the ſubtilty of a deceitful Devil: If the Devil by Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion may cauſe ſupernatural Concomitances and Conſequences to attend the natural Actions of Men without their allowance, as is manifeſt in poſſeſſed Perſons, how is it reaſonable and juſt that the Impoſitions of the Devil ſhould be imputed unto any Man: And (ſaith he) God forbid that the Devil's Signs and Wonders, nay his Truths ſhould become any legal Allegations or Evidences in Law.

I am told by credible Perſons, who ſay it is certainly true, that a bewitched Perſon has complained that ſhe was caſt into Fits by the Look of a Dog; and that ſhe was no more able to bear the ſight of that Dog, than of the Perſon whom ſhe accuſed as bewitching her: And that thereupon the Dog was ſhot to death: This Dog was no Devil; for then they could not have killed him. I ſuppoſe no one will ſay that Dogs are Witches: It remains then that the caſting down with the Look is no infallible ſign of a Witch.</p>

                  <p>Let me here premiſe Two things,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Evidence in this Crime ought to be as clear as in any other Crimes of a Capital nature. The Word of God does no where intimate, that a leſs clear Evidence, or that fewer or other Witneſſes may be taken as ſufficient to convict a Man of Sorcery, which would not be enough to convict him were he charged with another evil worthy of Death, <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. 30. if we may not take the Oath of a diſtracted Perſon, or of a poſſeſſed Perſon in a Caſe of Murder, Theft, Felony of any ſort, then neither may we do it in the Caſe of Witchcraft.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let me premiſe this alſo, that there have been ways of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Witches long uſed in many Nations, eſpecially in the dark times of Paganiſm and Popery, which the righteous God never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of. But which as (judicious Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> expreſſeth it in plain <hi>Engliſh</hi>) were invented by the Devil, that ſo innocent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons might be condemned, and ſome notorious Witches eſcape: Yea, many Superſtitious and Magical experiments have been uſed to try Witches by: Of this ſort is that of ſcratching the Witch, or ſeething the Urine of the bewitched Perſon, or making a Witch-cake with that Urine: And that tryal of putting their Hands into ſcalding Water, to ſee if it will not hurt them: And that of ſticking an Awl under the Seat of the ſuſpected Party, yea, and that way of diſcovering Witches by tying their
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57317:24"/>
Hands and Feet, and caſting them on the Water, to try whether they will ſink or ſwim: I did publickly bear my Teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Superſtition in a Book printed at <hi>Boſton</hi> eight Years paſt.</p>
                  <p>I hear that of late ſome in a Neighbour Colony have been playing with this Diabolical invention: It is to be lamented, that in ſuch a <hi>Land of Uprightneſs</hi> as <hi>New-England</hi> once was, a Practice which Proteſtant Writers generally condemn as ſinful, and which the more ſober and learned Men amongſt Papiſts themſelves have not only judged unlawful, but (to expreſs it in their own terms) to be no leſs than a <hi>Mortal Sin,</hi> ſhould ever be heard of. Were it not that the coming of Chriſt to judge the Earth draweth near, I ſhould think that ſuch Practices are an unhappy Omen that the Devil and Pagans will get theſe dark Territories into their Poſſeſſion again: But that I may not be thought to have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for my calling the impleaded Experiment into Queſtion, I have theſe things further to alledge againſt it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It has been rejected long agone, by Chriſtian Nations as a thing Superſtitious and Diabolical: In <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> it is wholly diſuſed; and <note n="a" place="margin">D<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:57317:26"/>There was in the Year 1649, in a Town called <hi>Lauder</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> a certain woman accuſed and impriſoned on ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of Witchcraft, when others in the ſame Priſon with her were Convicted, and their Execution ordered to be on the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day following, ſhe deſired to ſpeak with a Miniſter, to whom ſhe declared freely that ſhe was guilty of Witchcraft, acknowledging alſo many other Crimes committed by her, deſiring that ſhe might die with the reſt: She ſaid particularly that ſhe had Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted with the Devil, and was become his Servant about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years before, and that he kiſſed her and gave her a Name, but that ſince he had never owned her. Several Miniſters who were jealous that ſhe accuſed herſelf untruly, charged it on her Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, telling her that they doubted ſhe was under a Temptation of the Devil to deſtroy her own Body and Soul, and adjuring her in the Name of God to declare the Truth: Notwithſtanding all this, ſhe ſtifly adhered to what ſhe had ſaid, and was on Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day morning Condemned, and ordered to be Executed that day. When ſhe came to the place of Execution, ſhe was ſilent until the Prayers were ended, then going to the Stake where ſhe was to be Burnt, ſhe thus expreſſed herſelf, <hi>All you that ſee me this day! Know ye that I am to die as a Witch, by my own Confeſſion! and I free all Men, eſpecially the Miniſters and Magiſtrates, from the guilt of my Blood, I take it wholly on my ſelf, and as I must make anſwer to the God of Heaven, I declare I am as free from Witchcraft as any Child, but being accuſed by a Malicious Woman, and Impriſoned under the Name of a Witch, my Husband and Friends diſowned me, and ſeeing no hope of ever being in Credit again, through the Temptation of the Devil, I made that Confeſſion to deſtroy my own Life, being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it, and chuſing rather to Die than to Live.</hi> This her lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Speech did aſtoniſh all the Spectators, few of whom could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from Tears. The Truth of this Relation (ſaith my <note n="n" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare</hi> Inviſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble World. p. 45. and <hi>Burton</hi> Hiſt of Daemon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 122.</note> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) is certainly atteſted by a worthy Divine now living, who was an Eye and an Ear-Witneſs of the whole matter; but thus did that miſerable Creature ſuffer Death, and this was a juſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. When the <hi>Amalakite</hi> confeſſed that he killed <hi>Saul,</hi> whom he had no legal Authority to meddle with, although 'tis probable that he belyed himſelf, <hi>David</hi> gave order for hiis Execution, and ſaid to him, <hi>Thy Blood be upon thy Head, for thy Mouth hath Teſtified against thee,</hi> 2 Sam. 1. 16.

they are not ſuch credible Witneſſes, as in a Caſe of Life and Death is to be deſired: It is beyond diſpute, that the Devil makes his Witches to dream ſtrange things of themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which are not ſo. There was (as Authors beyond Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on relate) in appearance a ſumptuous Feaſt prepared, the Wine and Meat ſet forth in Veſſels of Gold; a certain Perſon whom an amorous young Man had fallen in Love with, was repreſented and ſuppoſed to be really there; but <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus</hi>

There were certain Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that imagined they road upon Beaſts in the Night, and that they had <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Herodius</hi> in company with them, beſides a Troop of other Perſons; the Council giveth this Sentence on it; <hi>Satanas qui ſe transfigurat in Angelum Lucis, transformat ſe in diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarum perſonarum ſpecies, &amp; mentem quam captivam tenet, in ſomnis deludit.</hi> Satan transforms himſelf into the likeneſs of divers Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and deludes the Souls that are his Captives with Dreams and Fancies; ſee Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> on 1 <hi>Sam. 28. p.</hi> 165. What Credit can be given to thoſe that ſay they can turn Men into Horſes? If ſo, they can as well turn Horſes into Men; but all the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches on Earth in Conjunction with all the Devils in Hell, can never make or unmake a rational Soul, and then they cannot transform a Bruit into a Man, nor a Man into a Bruit; ſo that this Tranſmutation is fantaſtical. The Devil may and often does im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on the Imaginations of his Witches and Vaſſals, that they believe themſelves to be be Converted into Beaſts, and reverted into Men again; as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> whilſt under the Power of a Daemon really imagined himſelf to be an Ox, and would lye out of Doors and eat Graſs: The Devil has inflicted on many a Man the Diſeaſe called <hi>Lycanthropia,</hi> from whence they have made lamentable Complaints of their being Wolves: In a word, there is no more Reality in what many Witches confeſs of ſtrange things ſeen or done by them, whilſt Satan had them in his full Power, than there is in <hi>Lucian</hi>'s ridiculous Fable of his being Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched into an <hi>Aſſe,</hi> and what ſtrange Feats he then played; ſo that what ſuch perſons relate concerning Perſons and Things at Witch-meetings, ought not to be received with too much Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>

His words are theſe, <q>This Summer (<hi>viz.</hi> Anno 1597.) there was a great buſineſs for the Tryal of Witches, amongſt others, one <hi>Margaret Atkin</hi> being apprehended on ſuſpicion, and threatned with Torture, did confeſs herſelf Guilty; being examined touching her Aſſociates in that Trade, ſhe named a few, and perceiving her Delations find Credit, made offer to detect all of that ſort, and to purge the Country of them; ſo ſhe might have her Life granted: For the reaſon of her Knowledge, ſhe ſaid, <hi>That they had a ſecret mark all of that ſort in their Eyes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe could ſurely tell, how ſoon ſhe looked upon any, whether they were Witches or not;</hi> and in this ſhe was ſo readily believed, that for the ſpace of 3 or 4 Months ſhe was carried from Town to Town to make Diſcoveries in that kind; many were brought in queſtion by her Delations, eſpecially at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> where <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Innocent Women, through the Credulity of the Miniſter Mr.</hi> John Cowper, <hi>were condemned and put to Death;</hi> in the end ſhe was found to be a meer deceiver, and ſent back to <hi>Fife,</hi> where ſhe was firſt apprehended: At her Tryal ſhe affirmed all to be falſe that ſhe had confeſſed of herſelf or others, and perſiſted in this to her Death, which made many fore-think their too great forwardneſs that way, and moved the King to recal his Commiſſion given out againſt ſuch Perſons, diſcharging all Proceedings againſt them,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57317:28"/>
except in caſe of a voluntary Confeſſion, till a ſolid Order ſhould be taken by the Eſtates touching the form that ſhould be kept in their Tryal.</q> Thus that famous Hiſtorian.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>If two credible Perſons ſhall affirm upon Oath that they have ſeen the party accuſed ſpeaking ſuch words, or doing things which none but ſuch as have Familiarity with the Devil ever did or can do, that's a ſufficient Ground for Conviction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some are ready to ſay, that Wizzards are not ſo unwiſe as to do ſuch things in the ſight or hearing of others, but it is certain that they have very often been known to do ſo: How often have they been ſeen by others uſing Inchantments? Conjuring to raiſe Storms? And have been heard calling upon their Familiar Spirits? And have been known to uſe Spells and Charms? And to ſhew in a Glaſs or in a Shew-ſtone perſons abſent? And to reveal Secrets which could not be diſcovered but by the Devil? And have not men been ſeen to do things which are above humane Strength, that no man living could do without Diabolical Aſſiſtances? <hi>Claudia</hi> was ſeen by Witneſſes enough, to draw a Ship which no humane Strength could move. <hi>Tuccia</hi> a Veſtal Virgin was ſeen to carry Water in a Sieve: The Devil never aſſiſts men to do ſupernatural things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſired. When therefore ſuch like things ſhall be teſtified againſt the accuſed Party not by <hi>Spectres</hi> which are Devils in the Shape of Perſons either living or dead, but by real men or women who may be credited; it is proof enough that ſuch an one has that Converſation and Correſpondence with the Devil, as that he or ſhe, whoever they be, ought to be exterminated from amongſt men. This notwithſtanding I will add; It were better that ten ſuſpected Witches ſhould eſcape, than that one innocent Perſon ſhould be Condemned; that is an old ſaying, and true, <hi>Preſtat reum nocentem abſolvi, quam ex prohibitis Indiciis &amp; illegitima probatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne condemnari.</hi> It is better that a Guilty Perſon ſhould be Abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, than that he ſhould without ſufficient ground of Conviction be condemned. I had rather judge a Witch to be an honeſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, than judge an honeſt woman as a Witch. The word of God directs men not to proceed to the execution of the moſt capital of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, until ſuch time as upon ſearching diligently, the matter is <hi>found to be a Truth, and the thing certain,</hi> Deut. 13. 14, 15.</p>

                  <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
                  <p>THE Deſign of the preceding <hi>Diſſertation,</hi> is not to plead for Witchcrafts, or to appear as an Advocate for Witches: I have therefore written another Diſcourſe, proving that there are ſuch horrid Creatures as Witches in the World; and that they are to be extirpated and cut off from amongſt the People of God, which I have Thoughts and Inclinations in due time to publiſh; and I am abundantly ſatisfied that there have been, and are ſtill moſt curſed Witches in the Land. More then one or two of thoſe now in Priſon, have freely and credibly acknowledged their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and Familiarity with the Spirits of Darkneſs; and have alſo declared unto me the Time and Occaſion, with the particular Circumſtances of their Helliſh Obligations and Abominations.</p>
                  <p>Nor is there deſigned any Reflection on thoſe worthy Perſons who have been concerned in the late Proceedings at <hi>Salam:</hi> They are wiſe and good Men, and have acted with all Fidelity accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Light, and have out of tenderneſs declined the doing of ſome things, which in our own Judgments they were ſatisfied about: Having therefore ſo arduous a Caſe before them, Pitty and Prayers rather than Cenſures are their due; on which account I am glad that there is publiſhed to the World (by my Son) a <hi>Brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate of the Tryals</hi> of ſome who were lately executed, whereby I hope the thinking part of Mankind will be ſatisfied, that there was more than that which is called <hi>Spectre Evidence</hi> for the Conviction of the Perſons condemned. I was not my ſelf preſent at any of the Tryals, excepting one, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>George Burroughs;</hi> had I been one of his Judges, I could not have acquitted him: For ſeveral Perſons did upon Oath teſtifie, that they ſaw him do ſuch things as no Man that has not a Devil to be his Familiar could perform: And the Judges affirm, that they have not convicted any one meerly on the account of what <hi>Spectres</hi> have ſaid, or of what has been repreſented to the Eyes or Imaginations of the ſick bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Perſons. If what is here expoſed to publick view, may be a means to prevent it for the future, I ſhall not repent of my Labour in this Undertaking. I have been prevailed with ſo far as I am
<pb facs="tcp:57317:30"/>
able to diſcern the Truth in theſe dark Caſes, to declare my Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, with the Arguments which are of weight with me, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that what is written may be of ſome uſe to diſcover the <hi>Depths of Satan;</hi> and to prevent innocent ones having their Lives endangered, or their Reputations ruined, by being through the Subtilty and Power of the Devils, in conſideration with the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Weakneſs of Men, involved amongſt the Guilty. It becomes thoſe of my Profeſſion to be very tender in Caſes of Blood, and to imitate our Lord and Maſter, <hi>Who came not to deſtroy the Lives of Men, but to ſave them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I likewiſe deſign in what I have written, to give my teſtimony againſt theſe unjuſtifiable ways of diſcovering Witchcrafts, which ſome among us have practiced. I hear that of late there was a <hi>Witch-cake</hi> made with the Urine of bewitched Creatures, as one Ingredient by ſeveral Perſons in a place, which has ſuffered much by the Attack of Hell upon it: This I take to be not only wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Superſtition, but great Folly: For tho' the Devil does ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times operate with the <hi>Experiments,</hi> yet not always, eſpecially if a <hi>Magical Faith</hi> be wanting. I ſhall here take occaſion to recite ſome Paſſages in a Letter, which I received from that Eminent pious and learned Man, Mr. <hi>Samuel Cradock;</hi> during my abode in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> the Letter bears date <hi>Febr.</hi> 26. 1690. Then take it in his own Words, which are theſe; <q>We have at this preſent one in our next Town, who has a Son who has ſtrange Fits, and ſuch as they impute to Witchcraft: He come to conſult with me about it, but before he came, he had uſed a means which I ſhould never have directed him unto, <hi>viz.</hi> He took the Nails of his Son's Hands and Feet, and ſome of his Hair, and mixed them in Rye-paſte with his Water, and ſo ſet it all by the Fire till it was conſumed, and his Son (as he ſays) was well after, and free from his Fits for a whole Month, but then they came again, and <hi>He tried that means a ſecond time, and then it would not do;</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved his Son into <hi>Cambridgeſhire</hi> the next County, and then he was well, but as ſoon as he brought him home he was afflicted as before. The Poy ſays, He ſaw a thing like a Mole follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, which once ſpoke to him, and told him he came to do the Office he was to do: I adviſed his Father to make uſe of the Medicine preſcribed by our Saviour, <hi>viz.</hi> Faſting and Prayer. Here have been others in this Town, that though they were under <hi>Ill-handling</hi> as they call it: One Family had their Milk ſo affected, that they could not poſſibly make any Cheeſe,
<pb facs="tcp:57317:30"/>
but it hov'd and ſwelled, and was good for nothing: They are now rid of that trouble, but how they got rid of it I do not know:</q> Thus my Letter. By which it is evident that Towns in <hi>England</hi> as well as <hi>New-England</hi> are moleſted with <hi>Daemons,</hi> only I wiſh that the Superſtitions practiced in other places to get rid of ſuch troubleſome Gueſts had never been known, much leſs uſed amongſt us or them.</p>
                  <p>Some I hear have taken up a Notion, that the Book newly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by my Son, is contradictory to this of mine: 'Tis ſtrange that ſuch Imaginations ſhould enter into the Minds of Men: I peruſed and approved of that Book before it was printed; and nothing but my Relation to him hindred me from recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to the World: But my ſelf and Son agreed unto the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Advice which twelve Miniſters concurringly preſented before his Excellency and Council, reſpecting the preſent Difficulties, which let the World judge, whether there be any thing in its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentany from what is atteſted by either of us.</p>
                  <p>It was in the Words following:</p>
