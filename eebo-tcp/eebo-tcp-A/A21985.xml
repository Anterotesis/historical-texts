            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

put in vse the power of our Lawes for any offence against vs in matter of
Loyaltie. And although wee haue no litle comfort in the experience which
that first occasion gaue vs, of the loue and obedience of the vniuersall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of our Subiects, by whose diligence and care of our person the said <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
hath bene apprehended: Yet hath the same brought vs withall, cause of further griefe, in that
by the said <hi>Copleys</hi> confession, there is discouered a conspiracie of a great number of others to haue
made an attempt not only dangerous to our Person, but to our whole State: whereof some prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
Gentlemen of qualitie are already apprehended, some others cannot yet be found by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Ministers of our Iustice. Wherefore, we haue thought good to giue knowledge of them
to all our Subiects by open Proclamation, not doubting but to finde as good fruits of their loue in
their diligent enquirie after these persons, as we did of <hi>Copley:</hi> Requiring and charging all Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants,
deputie Lieutenants, Iustices of Peace, Mayors, Sheriffes, Bayliffes, Constables, and
all other our Officers and Ministers whatsoeuer, to vse all care and diligence in the enquiring,
searching for, and apprehending of Sir <hi>Griffia Markham</hi> Knight, and such other persons, as are
here in the foote of this Proclamation described. And if they shall be so happie as to finde any of
them, to send them presently vp to some of our Councell. And though we doubt not but that wee
shall finde good proofe of the care of all good Subiects in doing their dueties herein: Yet seeing it
is a cause that doeth so neerely concerne not onely our Person, but the subuersion of the State of
this Realme, Wee cannot but adde this further Charge, That if we shall perceiue that any shall
vse remissenes, negligence, or other omission of their duety in pursuing this our pleasure, We shall
haue cause to iudge otherwise of them, and to proceede otherwise with them, then willingly wee
would haue cause to doe with any Subiect of this Realme; in whom we must acknowledge that
in generall we haue found as much loue and duety, as could possibly be expressed.</p>
