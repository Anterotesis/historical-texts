            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For on a time keeping Cattell in the Field amongst other yong men of his age and condition, he was chosen (in sport by them) for their Lord or Knight, and they to attend on him like dutifull Seruants: and although this their election was but in play, yet he whose spirits were rauished with great and high matters, first, procuted them to sweare to him loyalty in all things; and to obey him as a King, where, or when it should please him in any matter to command them: to which they all most willingly condescended. Thus after they had solemnly taken their oathes, he perswaded them to leaue that base and seruile kinde of life, séeking to serue in Warre, and to follow him, being the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: the which through perswasion they did, and so leauing their Cattell to their Fathers and Masters, they assembled all together, to the full number of a hundred at the least: vnto whom he seuerally gaue certaine Red Roses, to be worne for colours in their Hattes, and commanded them, that euer after hee should be called the <hi>Red-rose Knight.</hi> So in this manner departed he with his followers vnto <hi>Barnsedale Heath,</hi> where they pitched vp Tents, and liued long time vpon the robberies and spoyles of passengers, in so much that the whole Country were greatly molested by them.</p>

               <p>The first day hardly sufficed in good order to bring in the Banners, Standards, and Ensignes of the Conqueror, the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Images, and Tables of price, which were all brought in on C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

came Prisoners on foot, with his owne naturall Children, being little Infants: and after them followed a great Troup of his Seruants and Officers, as Masters of his Housheuld, Secretaries, Ushers, Controlers, Chamberlaines, with other Gentlemen of his Court, all in a most sorowfull manner, seeing themselues brought into such extremitie and seruitude, that they mooued to companion all such as beheld them. Of the Kings children, there were two Boyes, and one Girle, of age so young and tender, that they had small vnderstanding of their misfortune and misery.</p>
               <p>In this triumph followed the Father his owne Children, (after the vsage of his Countrey) clad in black mourning gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, sorrowing likewise for his hard misfortune. Then followed sundry of his approoued Friends: which, beholding in that plight their vnhappy Prince, brake cut into teares and sighes so bitterly, that their enemies themselues grieued at their mishaps.</p>
               <p>After these, followed one which carryed certaine precious Stones, that had béen presented to the <hi>Red-rose Knight,</hi> from some ancient Cities in <hi>Portingale,</hi> who immediatly followed in person triumphantly in his Iuory Chariot, apparelled in vestures of purple Tissue, hauing a Lawrell bough in his hand, and a Crowne of the same vpon his Head.

               <p>Thus in this gallant order marched they to the Kings Chappell, where in the presence of the King and his Lords, (which came to honour and grace their Triumphs) they gaue thanks to God for their succesfull victory: were after solemne Seruice was ended, they departed to King <hi>Arthurs</hi> Court, where euery one, as well Strangers as others, were most roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally feasted.</p>

But when the <hi>Red-rose Knight</hi> of <hi>England</hi> had vnderstoode the hold message of the two Damsels, he was sore abashed (considering the number of armed women he saw before him, and the great dangers they had suffered before on the Sea for want of v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Right Noble Ladies, I haue well vnderstood your spéeches: therefore I desire you for to shew such fauour vnto wandering Trauailers, as to tell vs in what Country Fortune hath brought vs to: and for what cause we are commanded by you to returne to the Sea?</p>

Not many yeares agoe, there raigned in this Countrey a King which had to name <hi>Larmos,</hi> for wisedome and prowesse not his equall was found in any of these parts of the world.

<pb facs="tcp:5886:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with a generall consent, dispatched certaine Messengers to the King, and to their Husbands, willing them to returne into their Countrey, and not to leaue their wiues and children in such extremity, without the comfort and company of man. Upon which, the King answered, that hee had besieged his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies in their Townes of Warre; and before one man should returne home till he came with Conquest, his Country should bee lost and made desolate, and the Women giuen ouer to the spoyle of his Enemies: Which answere, when the Ladies had receiued, they tooke it in such euill part, that they conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red against their King, and Husbands, and put to death all the men children that were in the Countrey; and after deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, when their Husbands, Fathers, and Friends returned from the Warre, that they should the first night of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, bee slaine sléeping in their Beds, and that neuer after they should suffer man to enter into their Countrey. After this conclusion, they crowned <hi>Caelia</hi> the Kings Daughter for their Quéene: And so afterward, when the King and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie returned from his Warres, this bloudy murther was prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised, and not a man left aliue, but onely the King reserued, whom <hi>Caelia</hi> would in no wise against nature murther: but yet notwithstanding, shee deliuered him into the hands of her chiefest Ladies, which put him into a Boat alone, and so sent him to the Sea to seeke his fortune. Therefore most noble Knights, this is the cause, why you may not enter into our Countrey: which if you doe, and not presently withdraw your selues vnto the Sea, the Ladies will suddenly giue you a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous Battell.</p>

will haue pitie vpon vs, and suffer vs not to end our liues by such an unhappy kind of death.</p>
               <p>With this request the two Damsels returned to the Quéen and recounted from word to word the humble suit of the <hi>Red-rose Knight,</hi> and what extremitie they were in: Which when the Quéene vnderstood, and that they were Knights of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the fame of which countrey shée had so often heard repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, shée demaunded, what manner of people they were, and of what condition?

               <p>The Quéene hearing the Damsels so highly to commend the <hi>English</hi> Knights, thinking also vpon their request, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan (in minde) to haue pitie of their misaduentures, and so instantly sent for them, and gaue them frée libertie to make their abode in her Countrey: which incontinently when the <hi>English</hi> Knights heard, how they should receiue a kinde wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and a friendly entertainement, grew so exceeding ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as though Heauen had sent them present comfort: so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming before the Quéene and her Ladyes, they saluted each other most courteously, and with great reuerence. But when the vertuous Quéene behelde this noble company before her, in all humilitie, shée deliuered to a hundred of her Ladies, the hundred <hi>English</hi> Knights, and reserued the Princely <hi>Red-rose</hi> Knight vnto her selfe: and so were they brought to the Quéenes Pallace, where euery Lady feasted her Knight in most gallant sort, and to their hearts content. But now when the Quéene had the <hi>Red-rose</hi> Knight in her Chamber, and had beheld the exceeding beautie of the noble Prince, shée tooke him by the hand, and led him into one of her Chambers, where the shewed him her Riches and Treasure: and after sayd vnto him in this manner.</p>

               <p>Most worthy Knight (then answered the Quéene) I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that the Gods haue sent you into this Countrey for two causes principally: The first is, that you and your followers
<pb facs="tcp:5886:14"/>
should be preserued from death by my meanes: The second is, that you should inhabit in this Countrey least it should in short time be left as a desert wildernesse: for it is inhabited onely by Women without a King, and haue no other Gouernour but me, which am their chiefe Princesse: And for so much as I haue succoured you, so succour you this desolate Citie, that it may be repeopled with your séed: and in so doing, you shall accomplish a vertuous déed, and winne to your names an eternall memory to all ensuing ages.</p>
               <p>I confesse (quoth the <hi>Red-rose Knight,</hi>) that you and your Ladies haue succoured mée and my followers in our great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie: and in recompense whereof, wee will imploy all our indeauours to the repeopling againe of this Countrey: But in regard of the secret vow my heart hath made, I will not yéeld my selfe to your desires; for if I should infringe my oath, mine Honour were greatly impaired: And before I would commit that dishonourable fact, I would suffer the greatest tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that mans heart can imagine.</p>
               <p>Incontinently, when the loue-sicke Quéene heard this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere of the <hi>English</hi> Knight, and perceiued that he was firme in his purpose, shée tooke leaue of him, and departed for that time, the <hi>Red-rose Knight</hi> likewise withdrew himselfe into his Chamber, pondring in his minde a thousand imaginations. But shée for her part was so troubled in mind, and so wounded with the Darts of blinde <hi>Cupid,</hi> that when the mistie darknes of night had couered the earth, shee layd her downe vpon her bed, where betwixt Shame and her Heart, began a ferrible Battell. Her Heart was incouraged, that shée should goe and be with him: but shame began to blush, and withstood that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion; by which meanes the battell was great, and indured a long time: but at last the Heart was conquerour, and shame vanquished and put to flight, in such sort, that the faire Quéene arose from her bed, and went and layd her downe by her belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Knight, where hée slept: and being in the bed, shée began fearefully to tremble, for shame still followed her vnlawfull practises: where after her quiuering heart began a little to be qualified, with her trembling hand she awaked him, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter spake in this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5886:15"/>
My most deare and affectionat friend, though like a carelesse wretch I come vnto thée apparelled with Shame, yet let my true Loue colour this my infamous presumption: for your Princely person, and Kingly demeanours, like Adamants haue drawne my stéeled Heart to commit this shamefull acte; yet let not my feruent Affection be required with Disdaine: and although you will not consent to be my wedded Lord and Husband, yet let me bée thy Loue and secret Friend; that a poore distressed Quéene may thinke her selfe happy in an <hi>Englishmans</hi> loue.</p>
               <p>When the noble Knight heard the faire <hi>Caelias</hi> voyce, and felt her by his side all naked, hee was so sore abashed, that hée wist not what to doe: but yet at last hauing the nature and courage of a man, hée turned to her, vsing many amorous spéeches, imbracing and kissing each other in such manner, that faire <hi>Caelia</hi> was conceiued with Child. and waxe great of a right faire Sonne: of whom she was in processe of time safe: ly deliuered; as you shall heare discoursed of large in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing History.</p>
               <p>But to be short, during the space of foure Monethes, the <hi>Fayery</hi> Ladyes lay with the <hi>English</hi> Knights, and many of them were conceiued with their séede in such sort, that the Countrey was afterward repeopled with male Children, and what happened amongst them in the meane season, I will passe ouer for this time: for the dayes and nights (that haue no rest) passe on their wonted course: in which time their Shippe was replenished with all necessaries, and the <hi>Red-rose Knight</hi> summoned together Sir <hi>Launcelot</hi> and the rest: and being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled, he sayd vnto them.</p>
               <p>My good Friends and Countreymen, you know, that long time we haue soiorned in this Countrey, spending our dayes in idle pastimes, to the reproach of our former glories: now my intent is, within these thrée dayes to depart this Countrey, therefore let euery man make himselfe in readines: for there is no greater dishonour to aduenturous Knights, then to spend their dayes in Ladyes bosomes.</p>
               <p>When sir <hi>Lancelot</hi> and the other <hi>English</hi> Gentlemen heard the forward disposition of the <hi>Red-rose Knight,</hi> they were all
<pb facs="tcp:5886:15"/>
excéeding ioyfull, and answered him; that with great willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse they would all be ready at the time appointed.</p>
               <p>But now, when the <hi>Fayerie</hi> Ladies perceiued the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations that the English Knights made for their departure, they grew excéeding sorrowfull, and complained one to another in most grieuous manner: but amongst the rest, the Quéene was most displeased, who with a sorrowfull and sad heart came vnto the <hi>Red-rose Knight,</hi> and in this manner complayned to him.</p>
               <p>Alas, alas, my deare Lord, haue yée that tyrannous heart, to withdraw your selfe from me, and to forsake me before you sée the fruit of your Noble person, which is nourished with my bloud. Deare Knight, behold with pitie my wombe, the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and mansion of your bloud; Oh let that be a meanes to stay you, that my Child (as yet vnborne) be not fatherlesse by your departure. And in speaking these words, shée began to wéepe and sigh bitterly, and after to whisper secretly to her selfe in this order.</p>
               <p>Oh you immortall heauens, how may mine eyes behold the departure of my ioy! for being gone, all comfort in the world will forsake me, and all consolation flie from me: and centra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise, all sorrow will pursue mee, and all misfortune come against me. Oh what a sorrow will it be to my scule, to sée thée floting on the dangerous Seas, where euery minute, perils doe arise ready to whelme thée in the bottomlesse Ocean! and being once erempted from my sight, my heart for euermore lie in the bed of tribulation, vnder the coueriure of mortall distresse, and betwéene the shéetes of eternall hewaylings. Yet if there be no remedy, but that theu wilt néedes depart, sweare vnto me, that if euer thou doest accomplish thy pretended boyage, (what it is I know not) that thou wilt returne againe to this Country, to tell mée of thy happy fortunes, and thatmine eyes may once more be hold thy louely countenance, which is as delectable to my soule, as the Ioyes of Paradise.</p>
               <p>When the Noble English Knight vnderstoode that the Quéene condescended to his departure, vpon condition of his returne, to which he solemnly protested, if the Gods gaue him life and good fortune, to performe her request: whereby the

And now (to abridge the Story) the time came that the valiant English-men should goe a Ship-boord: vpon which day, the <hi>Red-rose Knight</hi> and his followers, tooke leaue of the noble Quéene and her Ladies, thanking them for their kinde enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainements, and so went to the Port of the Sea, where they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred their Ships, and so departed from the <hi>Fayrie</hi> Land.

Unto which, the good Sir <hi>Lancelot</hi> most willingly agréed: And although hee was a Martiall Knight, delighting to heare the relentlesse sound of angry Drummes, which thunders threats from a Massaker, yet could hee like an Dratour, as well discourse a Louers Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story: therefore requesting the <hi>Red-rose Knight,</hi> and the other
<pb facs="tcp:5886:16"/>
English Gentlemen, to sit downe and listen to the Tale that followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The pleasant History which Sir Lancelot du Lake, told to the Red-rose Knight, being a Ship-boord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AT that time of the yeare, when the Birds had nipt away the tawny leaues, and <hi>Flora</hi> with her pleasant Flowers, had enricht the earth, and encloathed with Trees, Hearbs, and Flowers, with Natures Tapistrie, when the golden Sunne with his glistering Beames did glad mens hearts, and euery Leafe as it were, did beare the forme of Loue, by Nature pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon it: This blessed time did cause the Grecian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to proclaime a solemne Turnament to bee holden in his Couet, which as then was replenished with many worthy and valiant Knights: but his desire chiefely was, to beholde his Princely Sonne <hi>Valentine,</hi> to try his Ualour in the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament.</p>
               <p>Many were the Ladies that repayred thither, to beholde the worthy Triumphes of this young Prince: amongst which number, came the beautifull <hi>Dulcippa,</hi> a Mayden which as then wayted vpon the Empresse, being Daughter to a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Gentleman This <hi>Dulcippa,</hi> like <hi>Apollos</hi> Flower, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fayrest Uirgin in that company, had so firmely setled her loue vpon the Emperours sonne, that it was impossible to expell it from her heart. Likewise, his affection was no lesse in feruencie then hers: so that there was a iust equality in their Loues and liking, though a difference in their Birthes and Callings.</p>
               <p>This Princely <hi>Valentine,</hi> (for so was the Emperours Sonne called) entred the Listes in costly Armour most richly wrought with Orient Pearles, his Crest encompassed with Saphire Stones, and in his hand a sturdie Launce. Thus mounted vron a milke-white Stéede, hee vaunted foorth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to try his warlike force: and in prauncing by and downe, hée many times (thorow his Beuer) stole a view of his sayre <hi>Dulciopas</hi> face: at which time, there kindled in his Breast two sundry Lampes: the one was to winne the honour of the
<pb facs="tcp:5886:17"/>
day: the other, to obtaine the loue of his Mistresse. On the other side, <hi>Dulcippa</hi> did nothing but report the valiant arts of his prowesse and chiualrie, in such sort, that there was no other talke amongst the Ladies, but of <hi>Valentines</hi> honourable attempts.</p>
               <p>No sooner was the Turnaments ended, and this loue begun, but <hi>Dulcippa</hi> departed to her lodging, where sighes did serue as bellowes to kindle Leues fire. <hi>Valentine</hi> in like manner being wounded to death, still rometh vp and downe to finde a salue for his stanchlesse thirst: so séekes <hi>Dulcippa</hi> to restore her former liberty: for, she being both beloued, and in loue, knew not the meane to comfort her selfe. Sometime she did exclaime against her wandring eyes, &amp; wished they had bin blind when first they gazed vpon the beauty of Princely <hi>Valentine:</hi> Some times in visious the beheld his face chéerefull, smiling vpon her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: and presently againe, shée thought she saw his martiall hands bathed all in purple blood, scorning her loue and former courtesies. With that shee started from her dreaming passion, wringing her tender hands, till flouds of siluer dropping teares trickled downe her face: Her golden haire that had wont to be bound vp in thréeds of gold, hung dangling now about her Iuory necke: the which in most outragious sort she rent and tore, till that her haire which before lookt like burnisht Gold, were died now in purple and Uermillion bloud. In this strange passion remained this distressed Lady, till the Golden Sunne had thrée times lodged him in the Westerne Seas, and the siluer Moone her shining face in the Pallace of the Christall Cloudes. At this time a heauy slumber possessed all her senses: for she, whose eyes before in three dayes, and as many nights, had not shut vp their Closets, was now lockt vp in silent sléepe, lest her heart euer burthened with griefe, by some vntimely manner should destroy it selfe.</p>
               <p>But now returne wee to the worthy <hi>Valentine,</hi> who sought not to pine in passion, but to court it with the best, considering with himselfe, that a faint heart neuer gain'd faire Lady: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hée purposed boldly to discouer his loue to the faire <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cippa,</hi> building vpon a fortunate successe, considering that she was but Daughter to a Gentleman, and he a Prince borne, so
<pb facs="tcp:5886:17"/>
attiring himselfe in costly Silkes, wearing in his Hatte, an In dian Pearle cut cut of Ruby red. On eyther side a golden Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row thrust through a bleeding Heart; to declare his earnest affection. In this manner went he to his belooued Lady, whom he found in company of other Ladies waighting upon the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse: who taking her by the hand, he led her aside into a Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery néere adioyning: where he began in this manner to expresse the passion of his loue.</p>
               <p>Sacred <hi>Dulcippa,</hi> (quoth hee) in beauty brighter then glittering <hi>Cinthia,</hi> when with her beames shee beautifies the vales of Heauen. Thou art that <hi>Cinthia,</hi> that with thy bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse dost sight my clowoy thoughtes, which haue many dayes been ouer cast with stormy showers of Loue: Shine with thy beames of mercie on my minde, and let thy light conduct me from the darke and obscure Laberinthe of Loue. If feares could speake, then should my tongue kéepe silence: Therefore, let my sighes bee messengers of true Icue. And though in words I am not able to deliuer the true meaning of my desires: yet let my cause beg pitty at your hands. Other wise your deniall drownes my soule in a bottomlesse Sea of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: one of these two (most beautious Lady,) doe I desire: either to giue life with a chéerefull smile, or death with a fatall frowne. <hi>Valentine</hi> hauing no sooner ended his loues oration, but she with a scarlet countenance, returned him this ioyfull answere.</p>
               <p>Most Noble Prince, thy words within my heart, hath knit a gordion knot, which no earthly Wight may vntie: for it is knitte with faithfull Loue, and Teares, distilling from a constant minde. My heart which neuer yet was subiect to any one, doe I fréely yeeld vp into thy bosome, where it for cuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more shall rest, till the Fatall sisters cut our liues asunder. And in speaking these words, they kissed each other as the first earnest of their loues. With that the Empresse came tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Gallerie, who espying their secret conference, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently nursed in her secret hate, which shée intended to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise against the guiltlesse Lady, thinking it a scandall to her Sonnes birth, to match in mariage with one of so base a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage: Therefore purposing to crosse their loues with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
<pb facs="tcp:5886:18"/>
stratagems, and dryerie Tragedies, shee departed to her Chamber, where she cloked her treacheries vp in silence, &amp; pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in her heart how she might end their loues, and finish <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cippas</hi> life. In this tragicall imagination remained she all that night, hammering in her head a thousand seueral practises. But no sooner was the deawy earth comforted with the hote beames of <hi>Apollos</hi> fire, but this thirsting Empresse arose from her carefull bed, penning her selfe closely within her Chamber, like one that made no conscience for to kill: shée in all hast sent for a Doctor of Phisicke, not to giue Phisicke to rest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Doctor, thou knowest how oft in secret matters I haue vsed thy helpe, wherein as yet I neuer saw thy faith falsified: but now amongst the rest, I am to require thy ayd in an earnest bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, so secret, which if thou dost but tell it to the whispering windes, it is sufficient to spread it through the whole world: whereby my practises may be discouered, and I be made a noted reproach to all hearers.</p>
               <p>Madame (quoth the Doctor, whose heart harboured no thought of bloody deeds) what needs all these circumstances, where dutie doth command my true obedience? desist not ther, fore gentle Empresse, to make me priuy to your thoughts: for little did he thinke her minde could harbour so vile a thought: but hauing coniured most strongly his secrefie, she spake to him as followeth.</p>
               <p>Doctor, the loue (nay rather raging lust) which I haue spied of late betwixt my vnnaturall sonne, and proud <hi>Dulcippa,</hi> may in short time (as thou knowest) bring a sudden alteration of our state, considering that he being borne a Prince, and descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from a royall race, should match in marriage with a base and ignoble Mayden, daughter but to a meane Gentleman: therefore, if I should suffer this secret loue to goe forward, and séeke not to preuent it, the Emperour might condemne mée of falshood, and iudge me an agent in this vnlawfull loue; which to a voyd, I haue a practise in my head, and in thy hand it lyes
<pb facs="tcp:5886:18"/>
to procure thy Princes happinesse, and Countreys good. <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cippas</hi> father (as thou knowest) dwels about thrée miles from my Pallace, vnto whose house, will this day send <hi>Dulcippa,</hi> about such businesse as I thinke best, where thou shalt bée ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted, and none but thou to conduct her thither: where in a thicke and bushy groue which standeth directly in the midway, thou shalt giue her the cup of death, and so rid my heart from suspitious thoughts.</p>
               <p>This bloody practise being pronounced by the Empresse, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed such a terrour to enter into the Doctors mind, that he trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled foorth this sorrowfull complaint.</p>
               <p>Oh you immortall powers of Heauen, you guider of my haplesse fortunes, why haue you thus ordained mee to bée the bloody murderer of a chaste and vertuous Lady, and the true patterne of sobrietie: whose vntimelesse ouerthrow if I should but once conspire, <hi>Dianas</hi> Nymphs would turne their wonted Natures, and staine their hands with my accursed blood: Therefore most glorious Empresse, cease your determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for my heart will not suffer my hand to commit so foule a villany.</p>
               <p>And wilt not thou doe if then, (repl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Doctor hearing her resolution, and that nothing but <hi>Dulcippas</hi> death might satisfie her wrath, hée consented to her request (and purposed cunningly to dissemble with the bloody Quéene) who beléeued that hée would performe what shée so much desired: so departing out of her chamber, she went to the giltlesse Lady, sending her on this fatall message: who like to haplesse <hi>Bellerophon,</hi> was ready to carry an embassage of her own death But in the meane time, the Doctor harbored in his breast a world of bitter woes, to thinke how vilely this vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lady was betrayd: and considering in his minde, how that he was forced by constraint to performe this tragedy; therefore hee purposed not to giue her a cup of Poyson, but a sleeping

               <p>But now returne wee to <hi>Dulcippa,</hi> who beeing sped of her Message, went with the Doctor, walking on the way, where all the talke which they had, was of the liberall praise of Prince <hi>Valentine;</hi> who remayned in Court, little mistrusting what had happened to his beloued Lady: and she likewise ignorant of the hurt that was pretended against her life: but being both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone together in the Wood, where nothing was heard but chir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Birds, which with their voyces séemed to mourne at the Ladyes misfortune, But now the Doctor breaking off their former talke, tooke occasion to speake as followeth.</p>
               <p>Man of all other creatures (most vertuous Lady) is most miserable, for Nature hath ordayned to euery Bird a pleasant tune to bemoane their misshapps, the Nightingale doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine her Rape and lost Uirginitie within the desart Groues: the Swanne doth likewise sing a dolefull heauie tune a while before shée dyes, as though Heauen had inspired her with some foreknowledge of things to come.

Accurst am I in being constrayned to bee the bloody instrument of so tyrannous a fact. Accurst am I that haue ordained that cuppe, which must by Poyson, stanche the thirst of the bloody Empresse: and most accursed am I, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not withstand the angry Fates, which haue appoynted mée to offer outrage vnto vertue. And in speaking these words, hée deliuered the Cup into the Ladyes hands: who like a Lambe that was led to the slaughter, vsed silence for her excuse. Many times lift shee vp her eyes toward the sacred Throne of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, as though the Gods had sent downe vengeance vpon her giltlesse Soule, and at last breathed foorth these sorrowfull la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations.</p>

Which poore awaked Lady, being amazed both at her sodaine Maiestie, and the strangenesse of her passed Fortune and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, with farre fetcht sighes, shee related what happened to her in those desart Woods.

               <p>But now returne wée againe to the raging Emperour, who sifted the matter out in such sort, that hee found the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse giltie of her Sonnes want, and the Doctor to bee the instrument of <hi>Dulcippas</hi> death: who being desperat (like one that vtterly detested the cruelty of the Empresse) would not alleadge, that he had but set the Lady in a traunce, but openly confessed that he had poysoned her &amp; for that fact was willing to offer vp his life to satisfie the Law, therefore the angry Emperour sweares, that nothing shall satisfie his Sonnes reuengement, but death: and thereupon straightly commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Empresse to be put in prison, and the Doctor likewise to be lockt in a strong Tower: but yet because shee was his lawfull Wife, and a Princesse borne hee something sought to mittigate the Law, that if any on within a tweluemonth and a day would come and offer himselfe to combate in her cause a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst himselfe, which would be the appealant Champion, she should haue life: if not to bee burnt to ashes, in sacrifice of his Sonnes death: all which was performed as the Emperour had commanded.</p>

wéeping teares, discoursed all her passed dangers, as well the crueltie of the Empresse, as of the vertuous déed of the good Doctor. And hauing both recounted their passed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, they confented (disguised as they were) to trauell to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Court to sée if the Destenies had transformed the state of the Emperour or his regiment; for now no longer out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries, nor heauie stratagems, or sorrowfull thoughts sought to pursue them; but smiling fortune, gratious delights, and happy blessings. Now Fortune neuer meant to turne her whéele againe, to crosse them with calamities, but intended with her hand to powre into their hearts oyle of lasting peace. Thus whilst <hi>Apolloes</hi> beames did parch the tender twigs, these two Louers sate still vnder the branches of a shadie Béech, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted still their ioyes and pleasures: and sitting both thus vpon a grassy bancke, there came trauelling by them an aged old man: bearing in his withered hand a staffe to stay his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed body: whose face when Prince <hi>Vallentine</hi> beheld, with a gentle voyce he spake vnto him in this sort.</p>
               <p>Father, God saue you: How happeneth that you wéeried with age, doe trauell through the desart Groues, befitting such as can withstand the checkes of Fortunes sicklenes?

               <p>This good old Hermite hearing the curteous request of the Prince, safe downe by them, and in sitting downe, he fumbled forth this spéech.</p>
               <p>I come (young man) from yonder Citie, whereas the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour holds a heauy Court, and makes excéeding sorrow for the want of his eldest Sonne, and for a Lady which is likewise absent: the Empresse being found guilty of their wants, is kept close prisoner, and is condemned to bee burnt, vnlesse within a tweluemoneth and a day, she can get a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion that will enter Battaile in her cause: and with her, a Doctor also is adiudged to suffer death.

               <p>Nay (quoth the old man) if she be guilty, I cannot pitty her, that will cause the ruine of so good a Prince: for higher powers must giue example vnto their subjects.</p>
               <p>By Lady Father (quoth the Princely Shepheard) you can well guesse of matters touching Kings; and to be a svitnesse of this accident, wee will presently goe vnto the Court and sée what shall betide vnto this distressed Quéene. This being said, they left the aged man, and so trauailed towards the Grecian Court: and by the way, these Louers did consult, that Prince <hi>Valentine</hi> attired like a Shepheard, should offer himselfe to combat in his Mothers cause, and so to expresse the kinde leue and nature which was lodged in his Princely breast. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no sooner arriued in the Court, and séeing his Father to take the combat vpon himselfe, presently he knéeled downe, and like an obedient Senne, discouered himselfe, and withall <hi>Dulcippas</hi> strange fortunes: whereupon the Empresse and the Doctor were presently deliuered, and did both most willingly consent to ioyne these two Louers in the bands of Mariage: where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they spent their dayes in peace and happinesse.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE next Morning by the breake of day, the <hi>Red-rose Knight</hi> rose from his Cabbin, and went vpon the Hatches of the Shippe, casting his eyes round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, to see if hee could espie some Towne or Cittie where they might take harbour: and in looking about hee espied a great spacious Cittie, in the middle whereof stood a most sumptuous Pallace, hauing many high Towers standing in the ayre like the Orecian <hi>Piramides,</hi> the which he supposed to be the Pallace of some great Potentate: therefore calling Sir <hi>Lancelot</hi> (with two other Knights) vnto him, hee requested them to goe vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Citie, and to enquire of the Countrey, and who was the Gouernour thereof; the which thing they promised to doe: so arming themselues, (as it was conuenient, being strangers in that Country) they went vp into the Citie; where they were presently presented vnto <hi>Prester Iohn,</hi> who (being alwayes li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall and courteous vnto Strangers) gaue them a royall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, leading them vp into his Pallace: and hauing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence that they were English-men, and aduenturous tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileurs, he sent foure of his Knights for the rest of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, desiring them in the Knights behalfe, to returne to the Court, where they should haue a friendly welcome, and a Knightly entertainment.</p>
               <p>Thus when the <hi>Red-rose Knight</hi> had vnderstoode the will of <hi>Prester Iohn,</hi> by his foure Knights, the next euening with his whole company hee repaired to the Cittie, which was right Noble and fayre, and although it was night, yet were the Stréetes as light as though it had béene mid-day, by the cleare
<pb facs="tcp:5886:23"/>
resplendant brightnesse of Torches, Cressetts, and other Lights which the Citizens ordained to the intertaining of the <hi>English Knights.</hi> The Stréets through which they passed to goe to the Kings Pallace, were filled with people, as Burgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters, Knights, and Gentlemen, with Ladies &amp; beautifull Damosels, which in comely order stood beholding their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming. But when the <hi>Red-rose Knight</hi> was entred the Pallace: hée found the renowned <hi>Prester Iohn</hi> sitting vpon his Princely Throne, vnder propt with pillers of Iasper stone: who after he had giuen them an honorable welcome, he took the <hi>Red-rose Knight</hi> by the hand, and led him vp into a large and sumptious Hall, the richest that euer he had séene in all his life: But in going vp certaine stayres hée looked in at a window, and espied fayre <hi>Anglitora</hi> the Kings daughter, sporting amongst other Ladyes; which was the fayrest mayde that euer mortall eye behelde, and I thinke that Nature her selfe could not frame her like: but being entred the Hall, they fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the Tables couered with costly fare ready for supper: when as the <hi>English Knights</hi> were set at the Kings Table in company of <hi>Prester Iohn</hi> and <hi>Anglitora,</hi> with other Ladyes attending (hauing good stomaches) they fedd lustily; but <hi>Anglitora</hi> which was placed right ouer against the <hi>Red-rose Knight,</hi> fedde only vpon his beauty and princely behauiour, not being able to withdraw her eyes from his diuine excellencie: but the renowned <hi>Prester Iohn</hi> for his part, spent away the supper time, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pleasant conferences touching the countrey of <hi>England</hi> and King <hi>Arthurs</hi> princely Court: the report of which fame, had so often sounded in his eares. But amongst all other deuises, he told the <hi>English Knights</hi> of a Trée of gold, which now grew in his Realme, and yéerely brought foorth golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fruit, but he could not enioy the benefit thereof, by reason of a cruell Dragon that continually kept it: for the conquest of which golden tree, hée had many times solemnly proclaimed through that part of the World, that if any Knight durst attempt to conquer it, and by good fortune bring the aduenture to an end, he should haue in reward thereof his Daughter the faire <hi>Anglitora</hi> in marriage: to which many Knights reserted as well of fortaine Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, as his owne Nation; but none proued so fortunate to
<pb facs="tcp:5886:23"/>
accomplish the wished conquest, but lost their liues in the same aduenture: therefore I fully beléeue, if all the Knights in the world were assembled together, yet were they all vnsufficient to ouercome that terrible Dragon.</p>
               <p>With that the <hi>Red-rose Knight</hi> with a bold courage stood vp, and protested by the loue he bore vnto his countryes King, he would performe the enterprise, or lose his life in the attempt: so in this resolution hée remained all supper time, which being ended, the <hi>English Knights</hi> were brought into diuers chambers: but amongst the rest, the <hi>Red-rose Knight</hi> and Sir <hi>Launcelot</hi> were lodged néere to the fayre <hi>Anglitora,</hi> for there was nothing betwixt their Chambers, but a little Gallery: into which being come, and no sooner layd in their beds, but the <hi>Red-rose Knight</hi> began to conferre with Sir <hi>Launcelot</hi> in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>What thinke you (quoth he) of the enterprize I haue taken in hand? Is it not a deed of honour and renowne?</p>
               <p>Surely (replyed Sir <hi>Launcelat</hi>) in my iudgement it is an enterprize of death: for euery man in this countrey adiudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you ouercome and destroyed, if you but once approach the sight of the Dragon, therefore bee aduised, and goe not to this perrilous aduenture, for you can obtaine nothing thereby but reproach and death: and doubtlesse they are counted wise that can shun the misuentures, and kéepe themselues from danger.</p>
               <p>But then (quoth the <hi>Red-rose Knight</hi>) shall I falsifie my promise; and the promise of a noble minde ought still to bée kept: therefore, ere I will infringe the Uow I haue made, I will be deuoured by the terrible Dragon, And in speaking these words they fell asleepe.</p>
               <p>During which time of their conference, fayre <hi>Anglitora</hi> stood at their chamber doore and heard all that had passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, and was so surprized with the loue of this gentle <hi>Red-rose Knight,</hi> that by no meanes shée could restraine her affections: and returning to her chamber, casting her selfe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Bedde thinking to haue slept, but could not, shée began to say secretly to her selfe, this sorrowfull lamentation.</p>
               <p>Alas mine Eyes, what torment is this you haue put my heart vnto? for I am not the woman that I was wont to be,

for my heart is fiered with a flame of amorous desires, and is subiect to the Loue of this gallant <hi>English Knight,</hi> the beautie of the world, and the glory of Christendome.

And furthermore his minde is garnished with Princely cogitations, that I may not enioy his Loue: and he thinketh no more of me, then on her that he neuer saw. But graunt that hee did set his affection vpon mée, yet were it to small purpose; for he is resolued to aduenture his life in the conquest of the Golden trée, where hee will soone bee deuowred by the terrible Dragon. Ah, what a griefe &amp; sorrow will it be to my heart, when I shall heare of his vntimely death for hee is the choise of all Nature, the Prince of Nobilitie, and the flowre of worship: for I haue heard him say, that hee had rather die honourably in accomplishing his Uow, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne with reproach into <hi>England.</hi> Which happy country, if these eyes of mine might but once behold, then were my soule possessed with terrestriall ioyes. <hi>Anglitora</hi> with these words fell asléepe, and so passed the night away till the day came: who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This Dragon was farre more bigger then a horse; in length full thirtie foote, the which incontinently as soone
<pb facs="tcp:5886:24"/>

The first blowe that the Knight strooke, hit the Dragon betwixt the two eyes so furiously that hée staggered: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recouered, and féeling himselfe most grieuously hurt, hée discharged from his throat such abundance of thicke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

The Dragon through the great paine that hée felt, came and incountred the Knight in such a fashion that he beate him downe to the ground, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter stood ouer him as though he had béen dead: but the Knight tooke his Sword, and vnderneath him thrust it vp to the Hilts so farre that it pierced his heart: which when the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon felt as smitten to death, began to runne away with the Sword sticking in his belly, thinking to haue hidden himselfe in his Caue but his life departed before hée could get thither. Incontinently, when the <hi>Red rose Knight</hi> had rest himselfe, and saw that the Dragon was dead, he recomforted himselfe, and went and drew out his Sword from his belly, which was all to be-stayned with his blacke blood; and after tooke the Daragons thrée Tongues and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:5886:25"/>
bore in his hand: and so in triumph went towards the Cittie: and being come within the sight thereof, hee lifted vp the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den branch into the ayre as high as he could, that it might gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in the Sunne for the people to behold, (which stood vpon high Turrets, expecting his comming,) who perceiuing it, with great admiration began to wonder. Some there were that gathered gréene Hearbes and Flowers, and strewed the way whereas the Knight should passe to goe to the Kings Pallace, saying: that all Honour ought to bee giuen to so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and glorious a Conquerour.</p>
               <p>Faire <hi>Anglitora</hi> amongst all other, was most ioyfull, when she beheld the glistering brightnesse of the Golden branch, and commanded her Waighting-maydes to put on their richest attyres, to solemnize the honour of that excellent Uictory.</p>
               <p>And to conclude, he was met at the Citie gate, with the mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody of Drummes and Trumpets, and so conducted to the Kings Pallace: where he was right honorably entertayned of <hi>Prester Iohn</hi> and his Nobles. Surely there is no man so el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent, that can discourse by writing the great ioy that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glitora</hi> tooke at his returne: and generally the whole Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants had thereat excéeding pleasure.</p>
               <p>But now when the valiant <hi>Red-rose Knight</hi> had entered the Hall, and had set the Golden branch vpon an Iuory Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board richly furnished with costly Plate, the <hi>English</hi> Knights and many other Ladyes began to daunce most ioyfully, and to spend the time in delicious sports till Supper was ready, and then the King and the <hi>Red-rose Knight</hi> was set: and with them, the noble and faire <hi>Anglitora, Launcelat du Lake</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>English</hi> Knights: where (all supper while) there was no other conference holden, but of the valiant encounters of the <hi>Red-rose Knight:</hi> who for his part did nothing but make secret loue signes to faire <hi>Anglitora.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What shall I make long circumstances? The Supper pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and the houre came that the generall company withdrew them into their Chambers, the <hi>Red-rose Knight</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to his Lodging by many Noble men and others, which brought the Golden branch after him, and so bequeathed him for that night to his silent rest. But presently after the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
<pb facs="tcp:5886:25"/>
departure, <hi>Anglitora</hi> entred into his Chamber, bearing in her hand a siluer Bason full of warme perfumed Waters, the which shée had prouided to wash the Dragons blood from his body: which when the <hi>Red-rose Knight</hi> perceiued, and thinking vpon the kind loue that shée proffered him, put off his Cloathes, and made himselfe ready to wash. Faire <hi>Anglitora</hi> being attired in a white Frocke without sléeues, turned vp her Smocke aboue her elbowes, and so with her owne hands washed the body of the <hi>Red-rose Knight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now when this gentle Batcheler beheld her louely Body, her faire &amp; round Breasts, the whitenesse of her Flesh, and that hee felt her Hands marueilous soft, hee was so much inflamed with the ardent desire of loue, that in beholding her Beauty, hée began to embrace her, and kissed her many times most courtiously: and so after, when he had been well washed, <hi>Anglitora</hi> caused him to lie in his Bedde, beholding his well formed limbes, of colour faire and quicke, and could not turne her eyes from his sight: Thus as they were beholding each other without speaking any word, at last the noble Knight spake to her in this manner.</p>
               <p>Most deare Lady, you know that by this Conquest, I haue deserued to bee your Husband; and you, through kind loue, to be my Wife; whereby I may say, that you are mine, and I am yours: and of our two Bodies, there is but one: Therefore I require you to seale vp the first quittance of our loues, which is, that wée two for this night, might sléepe together: and so accomplish the great pleasure that I haue so long frished for.</p>
               <p>Ah most Noble Knight (answered the faire Lady) what in mée lyeth (that may bring you the least motion of content) shall with all willingnesse be performed: But yet I coniure you by the promise of true Knight-hood, that you will saue mine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, lest I bee made a scandall to my Fathers glory.</p>
               <p>There is no man in the world (quoth he) that shall preserue thine Honour more then I. What if you sléepe this night with me in bed, doe you any more then your duty, in that I am your Husband, and best beloued Friend.</p>
               <p>My deare loue (replyed she againe) there is no pleasure which
<pb facs="tcp:5886:26"/>
I will deny yée: but for this night, you shall haue pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I will neuer yéeld vp the pride of my Uirginitie, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ll my Father hath giuen me Mariage: and therefore I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you, that to morrow you will request that fauour at his hands: which being graunted and performed, then accomplish your content.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Red-rose Knight</hi> had vnderstood his Ladyes minde, hée like an Honourable Gentleman, was content to obey her request. What shall I say more? but that the night drew on to the wonted time of sleepe, which caused those two Louers (for the time) to breake off company. Here slept the <hi>Red-rose Knight</hi> till the next morning: which at the breake of day, was presented with a Consort of Musicke, which the King himselfe brought into his Chamber. Their melody so highly contented his minde, that he threw them a Gold chaine, which was wrapped about his wrist: a gift plainely expressing the bounty that beautified his princely breast. The Musicians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing departed, hee arose from his rich Bed, and went vnto the King, whom he found as then walking in a pleasant Garden: of whom he requsted his Daughter <hi>Anglitora</hi> in marriage, in recompence of his aduenture. The which request so displeased the King, that all his former curtesies was exchanged into so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine sorrow, and would by no meanes consent that <hi>Anglitora</hi> should bee his betrothed Spouse; and answered: that first hee would loose his Kingdome, before shée should bee the wife of a wandring Knight.</p>
               <p>The noble <hi>Red-rose Knight,</hi> when hée vnderstood the vnkind answere of <hi>Prester Iohn</hi> (all abashed) went vnto Sir <hi>Launce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat,</hi> and his other friends, and certified them of all things that had happened: who counselled him, that the next morning they should depart.</p>
               <p>After this conclusion, they went to the King, and thanked him for the high Honour hée had grac'd them with: and, after that, went and visited their Shippe, where for that day they passed the time in pleasure: and so when the scouling night approached, the <hi>Red-rose Knight</hi> went to the faire <hi>Anglitora,</hi> and certified her of the vnkind answere of her cruell Father: whereat thée grew sorrowfull, and grieued in minde: but
<pb facs="tcp:5886:26"/>
at last better considering with her selfe, shée yéelded her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune fully at his pleasure, promising, that for his loue, shee would forsake both Countrey, Parents, and Friends, and follow him to what place soeuer hée pleased to conduct her. And it is to be supposed, that this night the fayre <hi>Anglitora</hi> tooke all the richest Iewels which she had, and trussed them in a fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dle, and so when it was a little before day, shée came vnto the <hi>Red Rose Knight</hi> and awaked him: who presently made him ready, and so departed secretly from his Chamber, till they came to their Shippes: where they found all the rest of the <hi>English Knights</hi> ready to depart: So, when they were all a Board they hoysted Sayle, and departed from the Port. To whose happy iourney, we will now leaue them for a time, and speake of the discontents of <hi>Prester-Iohn,</hi> who all that night was exceeding sorrowfull for the vnkind answere, which he had giuen to the <hi>Red-Rose Knight,</hi> and so Melancholly that he could neither sléepe nor rest: but at the last hee concluded with himselfe, that he would goe &amp; conuey the <hi>English Knights</hi> (at their departing) vnto their Ships; to the end that being in other countreys, they might applaud his courtesies vsed to Strangers.</p>
               <p>So in the morning hee arose and went to the Chamber where the <hi>Red rose Knight</hi> was lodged, whom hee found departed contrary to his expectation. After that, he went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Daughters Chamber, where he found nothing but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentlesse walles, which in vaine hee might speake vnto: whose absence droue him into such a desperate minde, that hée suddenly ran to the Sea coastes, where hee found many of his Citizens, that shewed him the Shippes wherein the <hi>English Knights</hi> were, which was at that time from the Port or Hauen, more then halfe a mile Then the King (wéeping tenderly) demaunded of them, if they had séene his Daughter <hi>Anglitora?</hi> To whom they answered, that they had séene her vpon the Shippe hatches in company of the <hi>Red-rose Knight.</hi> At which the King bitterly lamented, beating his Brest, and tearing his milke-white Hayre from his Head, vsing such vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence against himselfe, that it greatly grieued the behold<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               <p>At that time there was many of his Lords present, who by

gentle perswasions, withdrew him from the Sea coasts to his Pallace: where he many dayes after, lamented the disobedient flight of his Daughter.</p>

And thereupon commanded the Master Pilot to make thitherward: but the windes net being willing, raysed such a Tempest on the Sea, that the Shippe was cast a contrary way, and the Marriners by no means possible could approach the <hi>Fayery land.</hi> At which time, the noble Quéene <hi>Caelia</hi> stood by the sea side vpon an high Rocke, beholding the <hi>English</hi> Ship as it passed by, as her vsual manner was euery day standing, expecting her deare Loues returne, many times making this bitter lamentation to her selfe.</p>
               <p>Ah gentle <hi>Neptune,</hi> thou God of Seas and Windes, where is my desired Loue: bring him againe vnto mee, that day and night wée peth for his company. Thus she complained at the same instant when her Louers Shippe sayled by; for surely she knew if by the Banners and Ensignes which were displayed in the winde: but when the poore Lady perceiued the Ship to turne from her, she was sore abashed and dismayed. In stead of ioy, she was forced to wéepe teares: and instead of singing, was constrained to make sorrowfull complaints. In this manner she aboad there all that ensuing night, and caused Fires and

               <p>This order kept shee every day and night for the space of sixe wéekes, wayling the want of him, whom she loued more deare then her owne heart: but when the sixe weekes were past, and that the <hi>Fayerie</hi> Quéene perceiued that she should haue no ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of her Loue, she went from the Rocke (all in dispaire.) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Chamber; where being entred, shee caused her Sonne to be brought vnto her, whom shée kissed many times, for the loue she bore vnto his Father: and after beholding the little Infant, crossing her Armes, with a sigh comming from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of her heart, she sayd: Alasse my deare Sonne, alasse thou canst not speake to demaund tydings of thy Father, which is the brauest Knight, the most vertuous, and the most valiant in Armes that God euer formed. Oh where is Nature (swéet Babe) that should enioyne thée to wéepe, and my selfe more then thée, for the lesse of so braue a Prince; whose face I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer more shall sée? Oh cruell and vnkind Fortune: my heart hath concluded, that I goe and cast my selfe, headlong into the Sea, to the intent, that if the Noble Knight bee there buried, that I may lye in the same Sepulchre or Tombe with him: where contrariwise, if hee be not dead, that the same Sea that brought him hither aliue, bring me to him being dead. And to conclude, before I commit this desperate murther vpon my selfe, with my Blood I will write a Letter, which shall bée sewed to my Uestments or Attyre, to the intent that if euer my body bee presented to the <hi>Red-rose Knight,</hi> that then this bloody Letter may witnesse the true loue that I bore him, to the houre of my death.</p>
               <p>Many Ladyes and Damsels were in her company whilst thus shee lamented her Knights absence: who hearing of her desperate intended death, made excéeding sorrow.

For since I last saw thy Shippe floating on the Seas.

THus when faire <hi>Anglitora</hi> had read those bloody lines, she greatly lamented her vnhappy death: &amp; withall, requested the <hi>Red-rose Knight,</hi> in that she dyed for his sake, to beare her Body into <hi>England,</hi> and there most honourably intombe it: to which he most willingly consented. So causing her body to be inbalmed, they hoysted sayle, and departed towards <hi>England:</hi> into which Country, they within foure moneths safely ariued.

               <p>After this, they intombed the body of <hi>Caelia</hi> most honourably as befitted a Princesse of her calling.

darknesse of obliuion hath couered. Now the Mother knowes her Sonne, the Sonne the Mother. Now may this valiant Knight boast of his Pedegrée, and a quiet content satisfie all your doubts. Thus haue I spoke my minde, &amp; thus quieted, my soule bids the world farwell. Adue faire Quéene, adue déere son, farwell louely <hi>Angellica;</hi> Lords and Ladyes adue vnto you all: you haue seene my life, so now behold my death: as Kings doe liue, so Kings must die. These were the last of Kings <hi>Arthurs</hi> words: And being dead, his death not halfe so amazed the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by, as the strange spéeches at his liues farwell.</p>
               <p>The Quéene in a raging ielousie fretted at her Marriage wrongs, protesting in heart, to be reuenged vpon the Nunne of <hi>Lincolne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Nunne of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> séeing her wantonnesse discouered, tooke more griefe thereat, then ioy in the finding of her long lost Son; supposing now, that (the King being gone) she should be made a scandall to the world.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Red-rose Knight,</hi> knowing himselfe to be begot in wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse, and borne a Bastard, tooke small ioy in the knowledge of his Mother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anglitora (Tom a Lincolnes</hi> Wife) excéeded all the rest in sorrow, bitterly sobbing to her selfe, and in heart making great lamentation, in that she had forsaken Father, Mother, Friends, Acquaintance, and Countrey, all for the loue of a Bastard, bred in the wombe of a shamelesse Strumpet: therefore she purposed to giue him the slip; and with her owne Sonne (a young gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Knight, named the <hi>Blacke Knight,</hi> in courage like his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) to trauaile towards the Kingdome of <hi>Prester Iohn,</hi> where she first breathed life and her Father reigned.</p>
               <p>In this melancholy humour spent they many dayes, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling their braines with diuers imaginations. The Court, which before rung with Delights, and flourished in gallant sort, now thundred with Complaints; euery one disliking his owne estate: Discontent as a proud Commaunder go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned ouer them, and their Attendants were idle Fancies, and disquiet Thoughts: and to speake troth, such a confused Court was seldome séene in the Land; for no sooner was Kings <hi>Arthurs</hi> Funerall solemnized, but the whole troupes
<pb facs="tcp:5886:33"/>
of Lords, Knights and Gentlemen, Ladyes, and others, were (like to a splitted Shippe torne by the Tempest of the Sea) se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, euery one departed whither his Fancie best pleased.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Red-rose Knight</hi> conducted his Mother <hi>Angellica</hi> to a Cloyster in <hi>Lincolne,</hi> which place she had so often polluted with her shame, there to spend the remnant of her life in repentance; and with her true Lamentations, to wash away her blacke spottes of sinne, that so grieuously stayneth her Soule: and from a pure Uirgine, made her selfe a desolute Strumpet.</p>
               <p>Likewise, King <hi>Arthurs</hi> widdowed Quéene, like to irefull <hi>Hecuba,</hi> or the tealous <hi>Iuno,</hi> kept her Chamber for many dayes, pondering in her minde what reuenge shee might take vpon <hi>Angellica</hi> her Husbands late fauorite.</p>
               <p>On the other side <hi>Anglitora</hi> Lady and Wife to the <hi>Red-rose Knight,</hi> with her Sonne the <hi>Blacke Knight,</hi> made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision for their departure towards the Land of <hi>Prester Iohn,</hi> where shée was borne: so vpon a night when neither Moone nor Star-light appeared, they secretly departed the Court, onely attended on by a <hi>Negar</hi> or <hi>Black-more;</hi> a Slaue fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to prouide them necessaries, and to carry their Apparell and Iewels after them; whereof they had aboundant store: The <hi>Blacke Knight</hi> her Sonne, (so called rather by fierce courage, then this blacke complexion) was all fiered with the ardent desire that hee had to sée his Graundsire. <hi>Prester Iohn:</hi> therefore without taking leaue of his Father (being then ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the company of his leawde Graunde mother) with a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble spirit conducted his mother to the Sea side, where a shippe was ready then to hoyst Sayle, where of the Pilots they were most willingly receiued for Passengers. And in this manner departed they the Land, the <hi>Blacke Knight</hi> wore on his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met for a Scutchon, a blacke Rauen féeding on dead mens flesh; his Caparisons were all of blacke veluet imbrodered, which most liuely figured foorth the blacke furie lodged in his Princely boosome. <hi>Anglitora</hi> his Mother, had the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre of an <hi>Amazon,</hi> made all of the best <hi>Arabian</hi> silke, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured like the changeable hue of the Raine-bow: about her necke hung a Iewell of a wounderfull value, which was a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amond cut in the fashon of a Heart split asunder with a Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish
<pb facs="tcp:5886:33"/>
Semiter: betokening a doubt that shee had of her Knights loyaltie. The slauish <hi>Moore</hi> that attended them, went all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, except a shaddow of gréene Taffata which couered his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie parts: vpon his foote a Morischo Shoe, which is nothing but a Soale made of an Asses hide, bucklde with small Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to his insteps vpon his Head hee wore a Wreath of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pres guilded with pure gold, and a Plate of Brasse about his necke close locked, with the word <hi>bond-slaue</hi> ingrauen about it. In this manner passed they the Seas, and was by these strange habites wondred at in all Countries where they came: In which trauels wee will leaue them for a time, and speake of other things pertinent to our Story.</p>

Uaine world, now must I leaue thy flattering intisements, and in stead of thy pompe and glory, must shortly treade the dolefull march of pale death: and this body that hath béene so pleasing to a Princes eye, must bee surrendred vp for wormes to féed vpon. Many other words would she haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but that the commaunding Messenger (being tyed to an houre) caused her to put on the impoysoned Roabes which no sooner came to the warmth of her body, but the good Lady af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a few bitter sighes, and dreadfull gaspes yéelded vp the ghost, being (through the extremitie of the infectious Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) made like vnto an Anatomie; which they wrapped in Seare cloth, &amp; the next day gaue her buriall according to her estate and so returned to the inraged Quéene, kéeping then her Court at <hi>Pendragon</hi> castle in <hi>Wales,</hi> into whose presence was no sooner the Messenger come, but the angry Quéene beyond all measure being desirous to heare of Lady <hi>Angel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licas</hi> death, in a rage ran and clasped him about the middle, saying.</p>
               <p>Speake Messenger speake, is the vile strumpet dead? Is the shame of womankind tortured? Is my hearts griefe by her death banished my boosome? speake for I am ouermai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred with doubts.</p>
               <p>Most gracious Quéene (quoth the Messenger) resolue your selfe of her death, for the cold earth hath inclosed vp her body: but so patiently tooke shee her death, that well might it haue mooued a Tygers heart to remorse; for in troth, my heart relented at the manner of her death, Neuer went Lambe more gently to the slaughter, nor neuer Turtledoue was more méeke, then this wofull Lady was at the message of her death: for the Elements did séeme to mourne, closing their bright beauties vp to blacke and sable Curtaines; and the very flintie walles (as it were) sweate at the agonie of her death, so gentle, méeke and humbly tooke shee her death; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending her selfe vnto your maiestie, wishing that her death, might be your soules contentment.</p>
               <p>And could shée bee so patient (quoth the Quéene) that euen in death would wish happinesse to the causers thereof? fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well thou miracle of womankind, I haue béen to thée a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage

Hereupon, shee in a furie commanded the Messengers head to bee stricken off, and seuen Seruitours to bee hanged all at the Court Gate, and afterward caused their limbes to be set vpon high Pooles by the Common high wayes side, as an example of her indignation.</p>
               <p>Neuer after this houre (such is the remorse of a guiltie conscience) could shée sleepe in quiet, but strange visions of this Lady (as shee thought) seemed to appeare to her: the least noise that she heard whispering in the silence of the night, did she imagine to bee some Furte to dragge her to Hell, for the death of this good Lady: the Windes (as shee imagined) murmured foorth Reuenge, the running Riuers hummed foorth Reuenge, the flying Fowles of the Ayre whistled out Reuenge: yea euery thing that made noyse (in her conceit) gaue remorse for Reuenge: and till that her owne life had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen satisfact on by death for the rume of so swéet a Ladyes life, no food could doe her good, no sléepe quiet her braine, no pleasure content her minde, but Despaire with a terrible countenance, did euermore attend her, willing her sometime to throwe her selfe head-long from the top of a Tower, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time by poyson to end her dayes, sometime by drowning, sometime by hanging, sometime by one thing, sometime by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: but at last in the middle of the night, hauing her heart déepely ouermaistred by dispaire, shee tooke a Girdle of pure <hi>Arabian</hi> Silke, which Girdle shee first word on her Princely Nuptiall day when King <hi>Arthur</hi> marryed her: this fatall Girdle shee made a riding knot of, and therewithall vpon her Bed post shee hanged her sefle. Thus blood (you sée) being guiltlesse shed, is quitted againe with blood.</p>
               <p>The Quéene being dead, was not so much pittied of the people, as the good Lady <hi>Angellica,</hi> little lamentation was made for her death; for euery one expected the like vntimely ende: but according to the aleadgeance of Subiects her Noblemen gaue her a Princely Funerall, and set ouer her an

The Dwarffe no sooner comming to the Gate, and espying people in such strange disguised attyres, neuer hauing séene the like before, without speaking one word, ran amazedly vp to his Master, certifiing him, that a kinde of people of an vnknowne nation was arriued, and that they séemed rather Angels (in shape) then any earthly creatures.</p>
               <p>The Knight of the Castle hearing this, came downe and met them in a large square Court paued with marble stone,

where hee kindly gaue them entertainement, promising them both lodging and other needfull things they were destitute of.</p>
               <p>The thrée Trauellers accepted of his courtesies, and being long before weather-beaten on the Seas, thought themselues from a déepe dungeon of calamities lifted to the toppe of all pleasures and prosperitie; thus from this paued Court the Knight led them vp to his owne Chamber, wherein was a fire made of Iuniper wood &amp; Frankinsence, which smelled ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sweete: the walles were hung about with rich Tapestrie, whereon was writ the story of <hi>Troyes</hi> destruction, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind, and the fearefull description of the latter day of Doome: likewise hung vpon the said wales, Instruments of all sorts of musicke, with such varietie of other pleasures, as they had neuer seene the like.</p>
               <p>Now while these weary Trauellers tooke pleasure in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding these things, the good Knight caused his Dwarffe (which was all the seruants that hee kept) to couer the Table, made of Cypresse wood, with a fine Damaske table-cloth, and thereon set such dellicates as his castle afforded; which was a piece of a wild Fore, rosted the same morning, with diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seruices of Fowles, whereof the Countrey had plentie: Their bread was made of the Almonds mixed with Goates milke (for no corne grew in this soyle) their Drinke, of the wilde grape, likewise mingled with Goates milke; which is in my minde, accounted restoratiue: to this Banquet were the Trauellers placed, where hauing good stomackes, they quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfied hunger, &amp; after began to chat of their aduentures what danger they indured by sea, &amp; how luckily they arriued in that Countrey, giuing the courteous Knight great thanks for his kindnesse.</p>

Day and night traualled the poore slaue toward <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> thinking to finde his Master there, and to reueale that which hardly hee thought would bee beléeued by him: wearie and opprest with hunger went hée this long Iourney: many Prouinces hee passed through, before hée could learne the way towards <hi>England;</hi> and then was hée so farre from it, as at the first, when hée departed from the Castle.</p>
               <p>The labouring Husbandman grieued not more to sée his Corne and Cattle taken by Théeues: nor the Marchant to heare of his Shippes suncke at Sea, then did this <hi>Indian</hi> at his vaine trauels, and wearisome Iourneyes to small pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: so at last setting forward againe, hee came to the sea side, thinking to heare of some Shippe to giue him passage ouer: but alasse, one crosse falls after another, one mischiefe comes vpon the necke of another: and one mischance seldome hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens alone; so as this true hearted <hi>Negar</hi> stood beholding how the billowes of the Sea beate against her banckes, and the Whale fishes lay wallowing in the Waues: behold such a tempest suddenly arose, that by the force thereof, the poore slaue was cast into the Sea: but by reason of his Silken vaile tyde about his middle, and his great skill in swimming, (as most <hi>Negars</hi> bée perfect therein) kept himselfe from

               <p>Oh blessed <hi>Neptune,</hi> hast thou vouchsafed to deliuer mée from the depth of thy bowels, and cast mée on land, where once againe I may behold my <hi>Anglitora,</hi> and my deare Sonne, the <hi>Blacke Knight.</hi> These seuen yeares famine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured on the Sea, hath béene a swéete pleasure to mée, in that the end brings mée to my desires. Full threescore of my mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Companions in this Shippe, hath death seazed vpon, and through Famine, haue eaten one another, making their hungry bowels graues for the others Carcases; and though now this belly of mine (like the Canibals) haue béene glutted with humane flesh, and this mouth of mine tasted the blood of man: yet am I as pittifull as the tender hearted Mother, forgetting her Sonnes offences: and to my <hi>Anglitora</hi> will bee as kinde, as if neuer shée had trespassed: nor like the <hi>Grecian Helina,</hi> left her marryed Lord: So taking the <hi>Blackamoore</hi> by the hand. Hée demaunded of her welfare, and in what estate his Sonne remayned? The true hearted <hi>Negar</hi> could hardly speake for griefe, or vtter one word for teares: yet at the last with a wofull sigh, hée vttered foorth these heart-killing speeches.</p>
               <p>Oh my noble Maister (quoth hée) by you from a Pagan I was made a Christian: by you, from a Heathen nation without ciuilitie, I was brought to a Land of Princely go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment;
<pb facs="tcp:5886:40"/>
and by you, till my departure, was I maintained in good manner: there if I should proue periured slaue, and a false Uarlet towards you, my body were worthy to bée made foode for hungry Folvles of the Ayre, and for the rauening Beasts of the Fields: therefore now considering that dutie bindes mee to it, I will reueale such wofull chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and such disloyall trickes shewed by your Lady as will make your heart tremble, your Sinewes shake, &amp; your haire to stand vpright. <hi>Anglitora</hi> your Lady and Wife, hath disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured your Bed and polluted that sacred Chamber of secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which none ought to know, but onely you two: That ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage vow shee made in Gods holy Temple, hath shée infringed, and vntyed the knot of Nuptiall promise: in a Countrey farre from hence hath shee wrought this hated crime: in a Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey vnpeopled liues shee in a Castle, which is kept vp a Knight of a wanton demeanour; there liue they two in adultery, there liue they secreatly sléeping in wantonnesse: and therefore these seauen yeares hath shée made her selfe the childe of shame: All this with extreame griefe doe I vnfold, and with a heart almost kilde with sorrow, doe I breath out the dutie of a seruant: if I haue offended, let my death make amends: for what I speake is truely deliuered from a heart vnfaigned.</p>
               <p>All this time of this his sorrowfull Discourse, stood the <hi>Red-rose Knight</hi> in a bitter agonie, like one newlie dropt from the cloudes, not knowing how to take these discourte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies: one while purposing to bée reuenged, and with his nailes to teare out the Strumpets eyes: another while, bewayling her weake nature, that so easily was woon to leivdnesse: but at last, taking to him (the vertue) patience, hee resolued to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell to the Castle, &amp; with his méek perswasions séeke to winne her former wickednesse, &amp; to forget, forgiue, and cast out of remembrance all these her vnwoman-like demeanours, obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Prouerbe, <hi>That faire meanes sooner winnes a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, then foule,</hi> Thus in company of his true seruant the <hi>Negar,</hi> hee tooke his iourney toward the Castle; where (after foure moneths trauell) they ariued; the <hi>Red-rose Knight</hi>) by the directions of the <hi>Negar,</hi> knocked, and in his Pilgrimes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, desired meate and lodging for himselfe and his guide.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5886:41"/>
The first that opened the Gate, was his owne Lady, who immediately, vpon the sight of them blushed, as though some sodaine feare had affrighted her; yet dessemblingly (colouring her acknowledge of them) shée in a charitable manner gaue them entertainement and conducted them to a by roame at the backe side of the Castle: into which place shee sent them (by her Dwarffe) victuals from her owne Table, with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, that the next morning they should auoyde, and neuer more trouble that place.</p>
               <p>This message sent by the Dwarffe, much disquseted the <hi>Red-rose Knight,</hi> and droue such amaze into his minde, that hee grew ignorant what to doe: And séeing his appointed time very short to remaine there, hee now thought fit to strike whilst the Iron was hotte, and to discouer what hee was: so taking the Scarffe of Iewells and Kings tyed to his left side against his heart (which shée knew perfectly well to bée the giftes of her Loue) and by the Dwarffe sent them her: The which no sooner shee beheld, but shée openly sayd to thée Knight of the Castle, that their secret affections were discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and her Husband in the habite of a Palmer made abode in her House conducted thither by the <hi>Moore,</hi> to bring their shame to light, and to carry her thence to <hi>England,</hi> there to be punished for her sinnes. Heereupon the Knight and shee purposed the same night to rid themselues of that feare, and by some violent death sende the Palmer to his last abyding. Disquietnesse attended on all sides for that day, and euery houre séemed ten, till night approached; which at last came, though long lookt for. Then <hi>Anglitora</hi> in company of the Knight of the Castle, like vnto Murtherers, rose from their Bedds, euen at that houre of night when mischiefes are acted, when no noyse was heard but the barking of Wolues, the howling of Dogges, and the croaking of Night-owles, all assistance to blacke actions: In this manner came they into the Lodging of the Palmer who for wearinesse of his Iourneyes, most soundly slept, little dreaming that such cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie; could be lodged in the boosome of his wedded Wife: one whose loue he had first gained with great daunger, and alwayes estéemed as deare as his owne heart blood. All signes of duty

               <p>Many were the Countries he passed: but more the dangers hee indured: all which for this time, wee omit: onely a little speake of thrée guifts giuen him by an Hermite, that had thrée excéeding Uertues: For comming to an Iland to séeke aduentures, it was his chance to saue a young beautifull Mayden from rauishing by a satyricall Wild-man: for he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing tyed the golden locks of her Hayre to two knoity bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and being ready to take his venerall pleasure vpon her, the <hi>Fayerie Knight</hi> comming by, and séeing that dishonour and violence offered to so young a Uirgin, with his Sword at one blow, paired away the <hi>Wild-mans</hi> head, and so went with the Mayden home to her Fathers house, which was an Hermitage some mile distant off: where being no sooner come, but the good old man, hauing a Head more white then Siluer, but a heart more heauier then Lead, by reason of the

want of his daughter, so cruelly taken from him, began at her sight to be so cheered, that he had not the power (for ioy) to speake a good space, but at last, taking the <hi>fayerie Knight</hi> by the hand, he led him to an inward roome, where hee banqueted him with such chéere as his Hermitage afforded; and after in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

deadly wound; for now my noble <hi>Fayerie Knight,</hi> this blood I offer vp vnto thy Soule. But being ready with his Sword to pierce his owne heart, hée saw a liuely blood spread in his friends face, and those eyes that were so dolefully closed vp, began now to looke abroad; and the countenance that was so pale and wan, receiued a fresh complexion: whereupon the <hi>Blacke Knight</hi> stayed from his desperate resolution, and from a bloody tragedian, became the recouerer of his brothers life; who after a while, began to be perfect sencible: so binding his bruzed bones together, they went a Shipboard on a Shippe that lay at anchor at the next Port, making for <hi>England,</hi> so the next morning (the wind serued well) the Pilots hoysted sayle, merily floting on the waters.</p>
               <p>Ten wéekes had not passed toward the finishing of a yéere, before they ariued on the Chaulkie cliftes of <hi>England;</hi> vpon which they had no sooner set footing, but with their warme lippes they gently kissed the cold earth, This is the Land of promised glory (said the <hi>Fayerie Knight</hi>) to finde this Land I haue indured many miseries: to find this Land I haue passed many Countries, and in this Land, must I seale vp the last quittance of my life, here shal my bones rest, for I am lawfully descended from the loynes of an <hi>English Knight:</hi> peace bee in my ende, for all my dayes haue béene spent in much trouble.</p>
               <p>In such like discourses left they the shore side, &amp; trauayling further into the Land, they met with one of King <hi>Arthurs</hi> Knights, named Sir <hi>Launcelat Dulake,</hi> so old and lame that through his bruises in chiualry, hée séemed rather an impotent creature, then a Knight at Armes; yet at the sight of these two aduenturous Knights, his blood séemed to grow young: and hée that before, could not march a mile on foote for a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, now went as tiuely as any of the two other Knights did. First came they to <hi>London,</hi> where for their fathers sake, they were (by the Gouernours) most gallantly entertained: the stréets were hung round with Arras hangings, and Tape, strie workes: Pagiants were builded vp in euery stréet, the Cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and such honourable graces, I thinke néedlesse. In <hi>London</hi> in great content stayed they some twenty dayes: in which time came noble messengers from the Court to conduct them to the King that then raigned: for since the <hi>Blacke Knight</hi> and his mother departed the Land, hapned thrée changes, euery one maintaining the ancient honour of King <hi>Arthurs</hi> Knights of the <hi>Round Table,</hi> whereof these two in presence of all the Nobilitie, were in Knightly sort created.</p>
               <p>After this, the King ordained a solemne Iusting to be kept in his Court, &amp; held in great honour for fortie dayes: to which Knightly sports, resorted the chiefest flowers of Chiualrie from all Countries, as Kings, Princes, Dukes, Marquesses, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>After this, being desirous to sée the Citie of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> where the <hi>Red-rose Knight</hi> was borne, hee in company of his Brother &amp; true friend, the <hi>Blacke Knight,</hi> and old sit <hi>Lancelat Dulake,</hi> rod thither, at whose comming into the Citie, the great Bell (called <hi>Tom a Lincolne</hi>) was rung an houre, which as then was seldome showne to any, excepting Kings, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned warriours, returning victoriously from bloody <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus hauing left the noble feats of Chiualry, they liued a life zealous, and most pleasing to God: erecting many Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses for poore people, giuing thereto great Wealth and Treasure: And when nature ended their dayes, they were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the same Minster, both in one Tombe: which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise was so richly set vp with Pillars of Gold, that aboue all ot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
