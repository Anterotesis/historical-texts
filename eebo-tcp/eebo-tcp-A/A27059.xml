         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Sect. 2.</hi> I have great reaſon to love his
<hi>love to truth,</hi> and the <hi>ſouls of men</hi> whom he
would ſave from the danger of ſuch errors as

no reaſon to diſlike his <hi>fidelity to his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi>

               <hi>Sect. 3.</hi> And far be it from me to judge
him ſo uncharitable as to doubt whether we
his ignorant brethren love not truth alſo,
and the fouls of men, and ſearch not after
it with ſome impartiality and induſtry; yea,
and would buy it at as dear a rate as others,
though through our ſin and weakneſs we
may not have had ſo good ſucceſs. And
it is a praiſe to our Creator rather than to
us, that we love that which by natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
we muſt needs love: <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi>
are neceſſarily <hi>good;</hi> and all <hi>evil</hi> is <hi>from good,</hi>
and <hi>for good.</hi> Our good intentions juſtify not
our errors, nor the <hi>reaſonings</hi> and <hi>conſidence</hi>
by which we ſet them off as truth. And by
our <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>haſty</hi> judging of <hi>thoſe things</hi>
which our <hi>reaſonings</hi> ſhew we never well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
or underſtood, and our cenſures of
thoſe that perhaps better underſtand them,
we ſhould but call men to ſuſpect thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings,
as not very like to know much
more than others, which no better know
themſelves. Inſtead therefore of <hi>calling out</hi>
to the Academical youth to take heed of the
Theology of thoſe worthy eximious perſons
who are my Cenſurers, I humbly entreat
them, with candid impartiality, to ſearch
after truth, and to receive all that deſerveth
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97269:4"/>
that name from the Cenſurers, and to reject
all that I or any other offereth them which
is againſt it; and proving all things, to hold
faſt that which is true and good: yea, and to
help me to ſee my errors, that I may repent,
and publiſh my retractation. Which I ſhall
not judge (any more than <hi>Auguſtine</hi> did) to
be in vain, though it ſhould pleaſe others, as
well as this learned Dr. to cull out for his
coufutation the firſt Book that ever I wrote,
about four and twenty years after I had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
(for the crudity and unfitneſs of many
expreſſions in it) retracted it, and to paſs by
about ſixty others, ſince written; and ſome,
yea many, much more largely and diſtinctly
than that which I retracted, on the ſame
ſubject.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 4.</hi> But though I am more obliged
than ſuch knowing men as he, to ſuſpect my
own underſtanding, that ſuſpition will not
warrant me to reſiſt the light, nor to reject
that which ſeemeth to me to be evidence of
truth, nor to forbear the rendering a reaſon
of my judgment, that I may be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by a confutation if I erre, or if I do
not, may not deſert that which deſerveth a
juſt vindication.</p>
            <p>And though I am one of thoſe who never
was worthy of his honourable employment,
to teach men to be Teachers of the Flocks
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97269:4"/>
of Chriſt, and theſe fourteen years have been
judged unworthy or unmeet to teach the
moſt ignorant Congregation in theſe Lands;
yet I doubt not but I may have his leave and
concurrence in bewailing the lamentable
condition of the poor people, by reaſon of
ſuch ignorant and unhappy Teachers, as I
and others of my rank have long been!
Alas, how great is their temptation! and
what perplexities muſt they needs be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to!
when we that have ſtudied night and
day with our moſt earneſt deſire to know the
truth whatever it coſt us, and with our moſt
ſearching, ſerious thoughts, and with our
daily prayers for divine illumination, do yet
remain not only ignorant, but ſo dangerouſly
erroneous, that if ſome did not ſilence us,
and others call out to the people to take
heed of us, it ſeems we were like to be their
deceivers, and to do them more hurt than
good! And if this were but I, and a few
more ſuch, or only the many hundreds that
now are ſilenced, the caſe were leſs lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table:
But, alas, it is the caſe of almoſt all
the Chriſtian World, for the people to be
caſt by their Teachers weakneſſes into ſuch
diſtracting perplexities as theſe! The <hi>Greeks</hi>
call to their people to take heed of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi>
and the <hi>Romans</hi> to theirs to take
heed of the <hi>Greeks:</hi> As alſo to take heed of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97269:5"/>
the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and all (as Hereticks or Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks)
that are not the ſubjects of the
<hi>King of Rome:</hi> And the Proteſtants requite
them. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> ſay, take heed of the
<hi>Calviniſts;</hi> and the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> ſay, take heed
of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Arminians.</hi> The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt</hi>
ſaith, take heed of the <hi>Non-Conformiſt;</hi>
and ſome <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> ſay, take heed of
the <hi>Conformiſts:</hi> till the poor people know
not when they are ſafe, but are tempted to
live as we did in the great Plague in 1665,
when each one fled from the face of others,
leſt every man that approached them ſhould
infect them. Whom to fear they know, but
whom to truſt they know not: unleſs they
muſt be of the ſide and Religion which is
uppermoſt, and think their Rulers always in
the right; and ſo that there are as many
right Religions in the World, as there are
Rulers of different Religions. And what
now ſhall the poor people do? Can they
hope to be wiſer than all theſe Teachers, to
diſcern which of them is in the right? What
is their remedy?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 5.</hi> In this ſtreight I am ready (yea
reſolved) ſo far to abate my reverence to
learned Contenders, as to hope that we are
more agreed than they ſeem willing that the
people ſhould believe, (and therefore than
they underſtand themſelves.) All true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97269:5"/>
are agreed in that which made a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
when the name of Chriſtians was firſt
known: and in that which was then thought
neceſſary to their mutual love and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
They are united in thoſe many ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
things, which I long ago mentioned
in a popular diſcourſe called <hi>Catholick Vnity:</hi>
And Proteſtants are agreed in much more
than abſolutely neceſſary things. And as it
is not the part of a good man to ſet the
Churches together by the ears, and to make
people believe that they differ where they do
not, or further than they do; and thereby
to tempt them to ſuſpect, cenſure, reproach,
or hate each other: ſo it is not the part of a
wiſe Teacher to think himſelf, that agreeing
men are not agreed; and that different
terms, or orders of expreſſion, make different
or contrary Doctrines or Religions: and to
be skilful in making one difference to ſeem
many, and verbal ones to ſeem real, and ſmall
ones to ſeem great, inſtead of being skilful,
by diſcuſſing ambiguity of words, in helping
men better to underſtand one another. And
for my part, I have ſo much experience of
the commonneſs of the miſtake, both of the
matter, and of each others minds, by reaſon
of the lamentable ambiguity of words, and
the common weakneſs of mankind in the
<hi>ordering, digeſting,</hi> and <hi>expreſſing</hi> their <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:97269:6"/>
and alſo in the <hi>reception</hi> of other
mens expreſſions, that I am reſolved to be
ſtill ſuſpitious of <hi>ambiguities,</hi> and not to be
eaſily and negligently deceived by a <hi>word un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explained,</hi>
though men of never ſo great
name or ſelf-eſteem ſhould deride me for it,
as a <hi>troubleſome diſtinguiſher:</hi> And I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to endeavour, to the utmoſt of my
little skill and opportunity, to undeceive
them that think a <hi>different name,</hi> or <hi>method,</hi>
is a different or contrary Doctrine; and that
all are Hereticks that ſpeak not in their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and ſing not in their tune, or pray not
in their form of words, though for ſo doing
the over-orthodox zeal do accuſe me of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity,
noxious <hi>Syncretiſm, Arminianiſm,</hi> yea,
or of as much complyance with Popery, or
Socinians, as this excellent <hi>Doctor</hi> doth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 6.</hi> Though I know that Hereſy
may (as <hi>Arianiſm</hi> once did) creep in, and
hide it ſelf in the addition of one letter;
yet I know alſo, that the confuſion of
tongues hath made it hard to expreſs our
ſelves ſo as eaſily to be underſtood, unleſs by
ſuch with whom we have had long leiſure
to open our meaning, and hard to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the mind of others: And that they
who agree in all that Chriſt, his Apoſtles,
and the ancient Symbols of Faith and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
made neceſſary to the agreement of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97269:6"/>
ſhould not too haſtily be condemned
as heretical; and that Church-tyranny and
Schiſm, while they cry out againſt each other,
are neerer kin in principles and effects than
their owners are well aware of: And that
<hi>over-doing</hi> as for <hi>orthodox Concord,</hi> by intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
things <hi>arbitrary, difficult</hi> and <hi>nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi>
as the neceſſary terms, hath been <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>'s
great engine to tear the Churches: And
had I been at <hi>Jerome</hi>'s elbow when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
ſo much of them that accuſed him
of Hereſy, for rejecting the term <hi>[Hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,]</hi>
and when he ſpake himſelf ſo much
againſt it, I might perhaps have ventured to
ſay to that learned angry Father, that it is
poſſible that neither his adverſaries nor he
were Hereticks, nor erroneous in the matter
or ſenſe at all; but that they meant by <hi>[Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſis,]</hi>
the ſame that he did by <hi>[Perſona;]</hi>
and that he miſtakingly accuſed an innocent
word, and they miſtakingly accuſed his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
ſenſe; and that the time might
come, when thoſe that then contended were
in the duſt, that the Churches ſhould indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently,
without mutual condemnation, uſe
either of the terms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 7.</hi> Melancholy is a ſuſpicious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour:
Many a one have I known that could
not be perſwaded, but that their beſt and
neereſt friends did plot their death, or to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97269:7"/>
poiſon them, or cut their throats; and every
thing and perſon that is neer them, ſeemeth
againſt them, and a cauſe of fear: As a good
woman (yet living,) <hi>caetera ſana,</hi> dare let
none come neer her till the ſpiders be bruſht<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
off them, which ſhe thinks ſhe ſeeth on them,
having once been affrighted by a ſpider. And,
ſome otherwiſe worthy men, do ſo cauſeleſly
and frequently cry out, <hi>This is Popery, and
That is Arminianiſm,</hi> as if they were perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the World that the contumelious ſaying
is true, <hi>Spiritus Calvinianus eſt ſpiritus melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholicus,</hi>
and that <hi>orthodox mens hearts muſt
meditate terror, and fear where no fear is,</hi> and
their charity muſt <hi>ſuſpect all things,</hi> and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>believe or hope of any good in others.</hi> And
we have not been (yea, yet are not) without
ſome Sectaries, carried ſo ſwiftly in the
the ſtream of prejudice, that before they
can ſtay to weigh and underſtand it, they
cry out, <hi>O Antichriſtian, Popiſh, Arminian,</hi> of
many an unqueſtionable truth of God; as if
they were perſwading men that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
reproach is true, that A Puritan is a
Proteſtant frightened out of his wits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 8.</hi> But to come to my preſent buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
This worthy Dr. and Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi>
the fervent defender of the Anabaptiſts, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
both newly publiſhed their ſuſpicions
and accuſations of me, for my doctrine of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97269:7"/>
Original ſin, and both called aloud to the
World to take heed of me, I take my ſelf
obliged to give them both ſome account of
the reaſons of what I hold, and humbly to
leave them to their leiſurely judicious cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
And becauſe God calleth me, by the
meſſengers of death, to other kind of
thoughts and works, than <hi>needleſs, tedious,
ungrateful</hi> contending for my own vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt the ſuſpicions and words of
others, I muſt take it as a ſufficient diſcharge
of this duty, to publiſh an <hi>old Country diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
on that ſubject, uſed above twenty
years ago in one of our (by ſome derided)
meetings of thoſe humble, peaceable, labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
godly Miniſters neer <hi>Kederminſter</hi> in
<hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> (who have moſt of them been
ſilenced theſe fourteen years.) And though
I am much to be blamed, if my maturer
thoughts ſince then, have not helped me to
clearer conceptions than I had ſo long ago:
yet finding by a haſty peruſal, that I am ſtill
of the ſame mind as then I was, I muſt crave
the Readers acceptance of it as it is, from one
that hath not time to amend it: And I
thought it not amiſs to add to it another
<hi>Diſputation</hi> (then uſed) of original Sin as
derived from <hi>Adam;</hi> and only to aſſiſt the
Reader's underſtanding of them by theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
notes: (entreating his pardon if he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97269:8"/>
meet with ſome things repeated in one which
were in the other, ſeeing this twenty years
ſilence may inform him that they were not
intended to ſpeak out to the world, though
this extortion now will juſtifie their publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation).</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 9.</hi> I. I do hold that the State of an
Infant as a meer Child of <hi>Adam,</hi> is not the
worſt that an Infant is capable of on earth:
And that nature in ſuch is not in the utmoſt
degree of its depravation. Cuſtom in actual
Sin may make it worſe in the adult; (for
they are not ſo bad as thoſe in hell): And Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
Sins may make it worſe in ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
than otherwiſe it would be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 10.</hi> II. Therefore I hold with <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffe
(Trialog. li. 4. c. 11, 12.)</hi> which I cited
to Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> that Original Sin is not equal
in all as he inferreth from his aſſertion, that
the penalty is not equal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 11.</hi> III. I do hold, that (beſides all
ſaid in the following diſputation to prove
the thing aſſerted) the true Nature and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of the Law of Grace, and the terms of
Life and Death determined by it, will fully
prove it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 12.</hi> IV. And I may well here ſuppoſe
that it is a Law of Grace that is now <hi>Norma
officii &amp; Judicii</hi> to all the world: which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth
them as Subjects, and by which they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97269:8"/>
be judged. For, 1. Were it not a Digreſſion,
I would prove that no man is under the meer
Covenant or Law of Innocency (which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
Innocency as the condition of life);
it being now naturally impoſſible to the
guilty. 2. And that the World is not under
the Jewiſh Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> as ſuch. 3. And
that thoſe are not under the Goſpel or Law
of Grace in the laſt Edition (by Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate)
who never had it, nor could have.
4. And that the World is not outlawed, or
out of the relation of ſubjects to God.
5. Nor yet are they as the damned, under a
meer remedileſs ſentence; but are under an
obligation to receive and improve mercies,
and uſe ſome means which tend to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
(as ſuch). 6. And therefore that
all that never had or can have the Law of
Grace in the laſt edition, are under the firſt
edition of it, which was given to fallen man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in <hi>Adam</hi> firſt, and afterward in <hi>Noah;</hi>
(ſaving that ſince the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is come, none
are bound to believe in him as yet to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate,
as if he were not come.) But they
are under the remaining part of the Law
of Grace; the tenor of which is plainly
enough expreſſed in God's proclaimed
name, <hi>Exod. 34. 5, 6, 7.</hi> and in many other
places of the Scripture. 7. For we were (and
therefore are accordingly accounted) as truly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97269:9"/>
in <hi>Adam</hi> when the Law of Grace (or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe)
was made to him, as when the Law of
Innocency was given him. 8. And that Law
is never ſince repealed, or nullified, (ſaving
by a more perfect edition to them that have
the Goſpel.) 9. And Chriſt that came not to
deſtroy or condemn the World, but to ſave
them, came not to bring moſt of the
World (without their fault) into a worſe
condition than he found them in; yea, ſo
much worſe, as to nullifie the univerſal Law
of Grace which was before in force, and to
leave them remedileſs, as the devils and
damned are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 13.</hi> V. All things being delivered
now into the hands of Chriſt, and all power
given him in Heaven and Earth; and all
men being his ſubjects as to <hi>obligation,</hi>
though not as to <hi>conſent;</hi> and all being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law of Grace, (of the firſt or ſecond
edition) (as made as truly with all mankind,
as the Law or Covenant of Innocency was,)
as that by which they muſt <hi>live,</hi> and be
judged; and ſo Nature it ſelf now being
<hi>redeemed Nature,</hi> (and neither <hi>innocent, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi>
nor utterly <hi>deſperate,)</hi> accordingly all
the World of ſinners hath ſome ſort and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Grace (or mercy contrary to merit)
from and by the Redeemer: which Grace
or Mercy in the natural tendency and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97269:9"/>
of it, is apt to diminiſh and reſtrain
their natural pravity; and doth make them
better by preparing them for ſaving regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
uſually before they are ſo regenerated,
(if adult:) And both adult and infants are
capable of a <hi>commoner</hi> ſort of <hi>Grace,</hi> who
have not <hi>ſpecial</hi> ſaving Grace. Beſides, that
even infants may have true ſaving Grace it
ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 14.</hi> VI. And as thus it is evident, that
even infants are not all in one ſtate or degree
of pravity, but may ſome be worſe, and ſome
better; ſo it is evident that now under a
Law of Grace, not to be better than <hi>Adam</hi>
maketh them, much more to become <hi>worſe,</hi>
(which may be, and oft is,) is not a meer pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
or fruit of the violated Law of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
but a <hi>privation</hi> of that Grace which
they were capable of by Chriſt, and ſo may
be a penalty of the Law of Grace. Now
the World hath a Phyſitian, <hi>not to be healed
is a privation of Grace,</hi> and not a meer <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
only:</hi> For an infant now <hi>not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,</hi>
juſtified, ſaved, is not only a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that which he never had any hopes
or poſſibility of, as it is to the damned: but
it is a <hi>privation</hi> of that which he was made
capable of by Chriſt; yea, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally
given by a ſealed Law of Grace
to all mankind. And this <hi>privation</hi> is not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97269:10"/>
               <hi>cauſeleſs</hi> on his part: God doth not deprive
infants of this mercy only as they are the
ſeed of <hi>Adam;</hi> for then all the ſeed of <hi>Adam</hi>
ſhould be ſo deprived of it. And to caſt all
upon meer ſecret <hi>election</hi> and <hi>reprobation,</hi> as
if infants were no ſubjects <hi>under Law,</hi> as the
rule of their <hi>right,</hi> I have in a Treatiſe now
in the Preſs, proved to be the inlet of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſtry,
and an opinion in which we ought
not to ſymbolize with the Anabaptiſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 15.</hi> VII. It followeth therefore, that
as God dealt with <hi>Adam</hi> and his ſeed under
the Law or Covenant of Innocency, and we
have our guilt of violating that Law from
him, as being in his loins: ſo God joyneth
children with their Parents <hi>(variatis varian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis)</hi>
under the Covenant of Grace, and we
are in infancy <hi>de jure</hi> the <hi>better</hi> or <hi>worſe</hi> for
what our Parents were, are, or did. And
that <hi>not to be healed, not to be juſtified and
ſaved,</hi> is not now to infants a penalty of
<hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin alone, but of thoſe Parents (or
pro-Parents) in whom the Law of Grace
doth judge the infant to have been, or done,
or not done what was neceſſary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 16.</hi> VIII. But no one was the <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Head</hi> and <hi>Father</hi> of all mankind but
<hi>Adam,</hi> (as none is the univerſal Head of the
regenerate, but Chriſt the ſecond, <hi>Adam.)</hi>
He was the firſt ſinful man; in him all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97269:10"/>
ſinned: And ſo he was the original
cauſe, and our participation of his guilt is
our original ſin in a double ſenſe, 1. As he
was the original of all mens ſin; 2. and as
we are guilty of it from the original of our
being. But of Parents ſin, not all the world
is guilty, but their own poſterity; and that
not as the firſt, but as a ſecondary or neerer
cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 17.</hi> IX. That God hath made many
promiſes to the ſeed of the faithful above all
others, is notorious in Scripture; in the caſe
of the bleſſed ſeed, and ſons of God before
the flood, and in the caſe of <hi>Sem, Japhet,
Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob,</hi> and ſo on to the end:
But were there no more than the ſecond
Commandment, and <hi>Exod. 34. 6, 7, 8.</hi> it
would be juſtly paſt controverſy. And I
have largely proved it to Mr. <hi>Tombs,</hi> in two
Books; my <hi>Plain Scripture-proof,</hi> and my
<hi>More proof</hi> of infants Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 18.</hi> X. The Apoſtle expreſly ſaying,
<hi>elſe were your children unclean, but now are
they holy;</hi> and this very ſuppoſition being
the reaſon of our baptizing the children of
ſome perſons, but not of <hi>all the World,</hi> doth
yet more exclude all reaſonable do ubt, with
thoſe that are for Infants Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 19.</hi> XI. As to be <hi>baptized,</hi> and taken
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97269:11"/>
into the Church, is not the right of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
meerly as a child of <hi>Adam</hi> redeemed,
(for then we could make no difference,) nor
meerly as they are <hi>elect,</hi> (for that we know
not;) but as they are children of Believers
dedicating them to God, (which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of their right:) ſo not to have right
to Baptiſm and its benefits, is not the meer
fruit of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, but of the Parents pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative
not-believing, and not-dedicating
them to God; (the controverſies about pro-Parents
is not pertinent to our buſineſs, and
need not ſtop us.) Here therefore is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
a grand penalty of Parents ſin on chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
(for a penal privation it is.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 20.</hi> XII. The true natural intereſt of
Parents in their children now, is as certain
as <hi>Adam</hi>'s in his off-ſpring: We have our
being as truly from them as from him, and
were as truly naturally in them as in
him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 21.</hi> XIII. The promiſes to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Believers are more numerous, and
plain in Scripture, than the promiſes to
<hi>Adam</hi>'s ſeed, if he had ſtood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 22.</hi> XIV. The penal comminations
againſt the ſeed of the wicked are ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and notorious in Scripture, that it is a
thouſand pities that any Miniſter ſhould not
acknowledge them, and the effects. Even
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97269:11"/>
from <hi>Cain</hi> to <hi>Cham,</hi> and the children of all
the old World, and of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and ſo to the
end: And if there were no Texts to prove
it but the two before-mentioned, the ſecond
Commandment, and <hi>Exod. 34.</hi> with <hi>Matth.
23.</hi> It's ſad that any Chriſtian ſhould deny
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 23.</hi> XV. It is notorious in Scripture
alſo, as to the execution, that God hath pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
the children not only for <hi>Adam</hi>'s, but
for the neerer Parents ſins: Which is true of
all thoſe drowned in the deluge, (as the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
cauſe ſheweth;) and of the ſeed of
<hi>Cham,</hi> and the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> and the infants of
the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> and all the Nations deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the command of God; of <hi>Iſhmael,
Eſau,</hi> the Egyptians, <hi>Achan, Gebezi,</hi> and
abundance more named after in this Diſpute,
and recorded throughout the Scripture; and
the Jews were not ignorant of it, when they
ſaid, <hi>His blood be on us and our children:</hi>
nor the Diſciples, when they ſaid, <hi>Did this
man ſin, or his Parents, that he was born blind?
Job. 9.</hi> The matter of <hi>fact</hi> is paſt all doubt,
and therefore the right.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 24.</hi> XVI. It is daily notorious among
us, that the children of ſome wicked perſons,
(Adulterers, Drunkards, Gluttons, idle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<hi>&amp;c.)</hi> have their bodily temper vitiated
by propagation from their Parents, by reaſon
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97269:12"/>
that the Parents had firſt by ſin corrupted
their own nature: ſome have the pox, ſome
ideots, ſome decrepit, ſome otherwiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to ſay that this is no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the children, or that it is only
for <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, is that which I will not do,
whatever any other may.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 24.</hi> XVII. And it is certain that the
<hi>minds</hi> of ſome ſuch perſons children are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily
depraved: ſome have natures
extraordinarily luſtful, ſome furious, ſome
ſenſleſs and inconſiderate, ſome ſlothful, ſome
falſe, verſatile and untruſty, ſome mutable
and unconſtant; ſome have appetites hardly
to be reſtrained, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, and all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
diſeaſes of the body, much tend
to the evil of the ſoul. And is all this
no puniſhment? or of none but <hi>Adam</hi>'s
ſin?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 26.</hi> XVIII. It is notorious that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
calamities in their eſtates, and other
accidents, befall children for the Parents ſins:
The ſacrilegious, perjured, murderers, and
deſpiſers of Parents ſeldom have a progeny
that is not notably plagued for their ſin.
And Divines ſhould not teach Atheiſts to
deny ſuch judgments of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 27.</hi> XIX. He that ſaith that children
have <hi>no guilt</hi> of the ſins of any Parents
ſince <hi>Adam,</hi> doth by conſequence ſay that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97269:12"/>
God neither ever did, or will do, or juſtly
can puniſh any child in the leaſt degree, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively
or privatively, for any ſuch Parents
ſin: But he that dare ſo ſay, is bolder and
blinder than I would have any wiſe and holy
Teachers of Chriſt's Flocks to be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 28.</hi> XX. Holy men in Scripture were
uſed in their ſufferings to confeſs and lament
the ſins of their fore-fathers as the cauſe; as
I have after cited out of the <hi>Pſalms, Ezra,

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 29.</hi> By this, and what followeth, I have
rendred to the Reader a true account and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

worth my own, and the Readers trouble, I
would undertake to produce abundance
more of Proteſtant Writers; and let but
Expoſitors on the ſecond Commandment
be examined by him that doubteth of it,
and he will be ſatisfied if he have ſtore at
hand. I only now ſay of many in general,
that the ordinary ſaying of ſuch Expoſitors
is, that temporal puniſhments, and ſome
ſpiritual, are oft inflicted by God on chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
for their Fathers ſins: I will give you
the ſenſe of many in <hi>Deodate</hi>'s words on
<hi>Exod. 20. 5.</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>[Viſiting:]</hi> that is, I enquire
after it, and puniſh it. <hi>[Of the Fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>]</hi>
As concerning eternal judgment upon the

own iniquity,<note n="*" place="margin">Original ſin is their own.</note> 
                  <hi>Jer. 31. 30.</hi>
but for the Fathers ſins the
children are often puniſhed in body, in
goods, and other things which they hold
and derive from their Parents, <hi>Num. 14.
33. 2 Sam. 12. 11.</hi> and 21. 5. 15. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
God oftentimes curſeth the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the wicked, withdrawing his grace
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97269:19"/>
ſpirit from it, whereby imitating their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
wickedneſs, they are puniſhed in the
ſame manner, <hi>1 Sam. 15. 2. Matth. 23.
32. 25.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 42.</hi> Here note, 1. that there can be
no puniſhment (temporal or eternal) where
there is no imputed guilt. Therefore all
thoſe Divines who ſay that not only Parents
in their children, but children for their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
ſins, have the leaſt puniſhment, do
thereby aſſert a guilt.</p>
            <p>2. That there is no guilt of ſin which
deſerveth not great, yea perpetual puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if not remitted.</p>
            <p>3. That privation of Grace, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
here mentioned, is a moſt heavy puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
tending to that which is perpetual.</p>
            <p>4. That children are to derive from their
Parents (or from God by them) greater mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
than goods, health, &amp;c. even Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberſhip,
right to Baptiſm, and ſo to
pardon, and the other ſaving benefits of
the Covenant, (as being holy): Therefore
by the ſame reaſon, as health, goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may
be denied them, becauſe they are <hi>derived
from Parents,</hi> (as <hi>Deodate</hi> ſpeaks,) Baptiſm
and its benefits may be denied them.</p>
            <p>5. And hath not the univerſal Church
given us their judgment of the caſe, who
have in all ages judged that Baptiſm is to be
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97269:19"/>
denied to the children of Heathens and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels?
(unleſs other mens owning them,
make them no longer theirs.) At leaſt I
may ſay, if as many be of my judgment
concerning our guilt of Parents ſins, as hold
that Baptiſm and its fruits are to be denied
to ſuch children of Infidels, the number will
be ſo great and honourable, that I would
wiſh this worthy Dr. no more to make them
ſeem as none. And, as I have before ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
not to be baptized is to them a penalty:
and that not only in the judgment of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
who ſhut ſuch out of Heaven, but of
the ancient Doctors, who took Baptiſm to
be our ſolemn inveſtiture in a ſtate of life,
and the ſeal of pardon and right to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
(as <hi>Gataker</hi> againſt <hi>Davenant de
Bapt.</hi> hath proved by citing a multitude of
their teſtimonies, as an uſeful Index to
ſave Readers much labour on that point.)
And I have elſewhere proved
at large<note n="*" place="margin">Diſputat. of Right to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram.</note> that the Scripture
mentioneth no Baptiſme of
Chriſt's Inſtitution, which was
not for the remiſſion of ſin. If any ſay that
this is no new penalty, but a leaving them
under the old, and that it is not for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
unbelief, but the Parents only do omit
their duty needful to the childs liberation;
I again anſwer, that had there been no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97269:20"/>
Covenant, Means, or Hope, it had
indeed been no penalty, becauſe no priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but a negation. And had not the
child's right and deliverance been laid on
the Parents Faith and Conſent as a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they had but negatively left them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the penalty of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, and their
corruption, (with the guilt next to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.)
But remember that <hi>poena damni,</hi>
the loſs of Heaven is <hi>vere poena,</hi> and ſo is the
loſs of <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> (not to an unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
but to a capable ſubject): And that
ſins of <hi>omiſſion</hi> are truly ſins: And that as a
Father murders his child, if he <hi>feed him not,</hi>
ſo he doth by omiſſion do much to damn
him, if he do not believingly dedicate him to
Chriſt; (for I ſpeak not of unavoidable
want of Baptiſm, which <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf
thought not to be damning, however
miſtaken herein by many.) A mans own
<hi>not-believing</hi> is <hi>nothing;</hi> but it is ſuch a <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
as is puniſhed with a <hi>non-ſalvation,</hi>
which is another <hi>nothing;</hi> yea, that and
other omiſſions, with poſitive damnation,
and the pain of ſenſe.</p>
            <p>6. But further note, that this great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
ſheweth that it is not only the ſins of
Parents before Generation, and in it, but
alſo after the child's birth, while the child
is void of the uſe of reaſon and will for
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97269:20"/>
himſelf, that the child may be puniſhed by
and for, with this penal non-liberation.
Much more evident then is it that <hi>this,</hi> with
his additional pravity and bodily diſtempers,
all together, are a penalty for the Parents for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
unbelief, and other ſins, with this omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>7. And again I ſay, that if the very <hi>guilt</hi>
and <hi>corruption</hi> derived from <hi>Adam,</hi> had not
been my next Parents firſt, it had never been
mine, no more than my nature: For I had
it not immediately from <hi>Adam,</hi> but from
them. And if I had <hi>that as theirs firſt,</hi> I
muſt by the ſame reaſon have more of
theirs: And who can bring a clean thing
out of an unclean? And <hi>David</hi>'s Mother is
ſaid to conceive him in ſin, <hi>Pſal. 51.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. Let it be noted for anſwer to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
from <hi>Ezek. 18. &amp;c.</hi> 1. That there
is by the Covenant of Grace, a pardon with
right to Chriſt and Life, freely given to all
the faithful and their infant-ſeed, as by
them (having full power thereto) in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
given up to Chriſt: Now, no one is
damned for pardoned ſins. The infant is at
once guilty of <hi>Adam</hi>'s and his Parents ſin;
and at once his nature receiveth pravity
from both, (but immediately only by the
immediate Parents;) and at once both are
pardoned to him, and this pardon ſolemnly
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97269:21"/>
ſealed and delivered in Baptiſm. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
well may God ſay to the pardoned, to
the penitent, and to the innocent, that he
ſhall not die for his Parents ſins, (no, not
for <hi>Adam</hi>'s.) 2. For the Text ſpeaketh to
the adult, and to men that thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
innocent, and that they ſuffered for
their Parents ſins, and not their own: And
God aſſureth them, 1. that if they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
they ſhall not die; 2. yea, if they
be repenting perſons, and pardoned, and
obedient evangelically, hating all the ſins of
their wicked Parents, they ſhall live. 3. yea,
this is true of their children alſo for their
ſakes. But this is not becauſe the Law ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
judged them guilty, and worthy of
death; but becauſe the Grace of Chriſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveth
it: elſe the Text would exempt all
infants from the guilty of death, for <hi>Adam</hi>'s
ſin.</p>
            <p>But there is not a word in the Text to
prove, 1. that children need no pardon for
their guilty of Parents ſins: 2. or that thoſe
that are not pardoned, being themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified,
(or if adult, live wickedly as
their Parents did) ſhall not die for them:
3. or that ſuch ſins of Parents are not the
cauſe of ſuch guilt and pravity in the child,
as that he is truly ſaid to die for his own
ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:97269:21"/>
               <hi>Sect. 43.</hi> XIII. Yet further methinks, to
a conformable Doctor, the judgment of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> in her Liturgy ſhould
not be inſignificant; <hi>[Remember not Lord
our offences, nor the offences of our fore-Fathers;
neither take thou vengeance on our
ſins:]</hi> In what ſenſe do men ſubſcribe this,
and daily uſe it? 1. Do they think that
the Church meaneth only <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, by our
<hi>[fore-Fathers]?</hi> 2. Or that by <hi>[not-remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring,]</hi>
they mean <hi>[not-pardoning,</hi> and <hi>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhing]?</hi>
3. Or do they think that they
pray for the dead, in Purgatory, Hell, or
Heaven? Or rather do they not imitate <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
and the Jewiſh Church, and <hi>Ezra, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,
Daniel, &amp;c.</hi> who confeſſed that they
were puniſhed for their Fathers ſins?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 44.</hi> I conclude this ſubject with a
ſecond requeſt to the Chriſtian Reader, to
pity and pray for the poor diſtreſſed Church
of Chriſt, which is diſtracted and diſtreſſed
thus, even by ſuch as are moſt devoted to its
ſervice, through the great weakneſs of our
judgments, and the unhappy paſſions and
ſtrivings that thence follow. Either I or
this worthy perſon are miſtaken, or elſe we
differ not: When I look to the <hi>Perſon only,</hi>
and not to the <hi>Evidence,</hi> nor to the <hi>Conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
I have far greateſt reaſon to ſuſpect that
I am liker to erre than he: And if it prove
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97269:22"/>
ſo, the evidence yet ſeemeth to me ſo full for
what I hold, that I am almoſt hopeleſs of
being otherwiſe perſwaded; And my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is not at my command: How then
ſhall I avoid the injury of ſouls? But yet
I think, that to hold our ſelves more guilty
of our Parents ſins than we are, is no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
damning error: it may moleſt us, but
not undo us; and I never ſaw many much
moleſted by it.</p>
            <p>But if either we differ not, when yet he
giveth you ſo loud an Alarm, or if it be he
that erreth indeed; alas! what muſt the
Church expect from the too great number
of ignorant and ungodly Teachers, when it
muſt be thus uſed by the <hi>Learned</hi> and the
<hi>Godly?</hi> My thoughts are, 1. that it deſerveth
tears from faithful Miniſters to obſerve, that
ſo conſiderable a part of the common guilt
and miſery of all mankind, ſhould by godly
men be no more confeſſed and lamented!
2. And that by thoſe that for any denial or
extenuation of our original ſin as from
<hi>Adam,</hi> are ſo heinouſly (and juſtly) offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with the erroneous: yea, ready to vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
men as <hi>Arminians,</hi> if not <hi>Socinians,</hi> that
they think come near it! 3. That ever the
ſtream of a Party, Reputation, Intereſt,
Example, or whatever elſe of that kind,
ſhould with ſo many good men, have ſo
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97269:22"/>
great a power, in making truth or error, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or ſin, good or evil, orthodox or heretical,
in their conceits; and ſo much faction he
found in their Religion! 4. That ever ſo
many millions ſhould be taught impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in ſo plain a caſe, when repentance and
confeſſion have ſo conſiderable a place
among the requiſites to remiſſion! 5. That
ever ſo many millions ſhould by Preachers
be taught that they have no need of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
nor of Pardon, nor to pray for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
for ſo much of their guilty and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!
6. That ever ſo much of the plain
ſtream of Scripture-evidence can be denied
and made light of, by good men that cry up
the Scripture authority and ſufficiency, even
when they can lay a great ſtreſs, in ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
hurtful controverſie, upon ſome
one Text whoſe ſenſe is not to be certainly
underſtood! 7. That ever good and learned
Teachers ſhould be ſo conceited of their
own conceptions, as in their confidence in
ſuch a cauſe to brand God's truth with the
name of error, and their brethren as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
men for not erring as they do!
8. And finally, that the poor people muſt be
under ſuch grievous perplexing temptations
as I before mentioned; and that the Papiſts

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Worthy Sir, I accept your admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition:
When God is ſo ſolemnly appealed
to, and I that am paſſing quickly to his
judgment, am ſummoned ſo friendly to make
my ſerious preparatory examination before
him and my conſcience, neglect would be my
aggravated ſin. But your call for <hi>[Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence]</hi>
tells me that you know me not, who
have little ſpared for labour theſe 37 years:
And I am now unfit for increaſed dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
            <p>1. As to the matter of Juſtification, (I will
not ſummon you before God or Conſcience,
but) What will the World think of your
dealing, to bait (and that by groſs miſreport)
a ſmall book above twenty years retracted,
(after voluminous Animadverſions in MS.
from many learned men) and purpoſely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
in a larger Book called <hi>The Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of my Faith about Juſtification,</hi> &amp;c. and
much fullier in my <hi>Diſputations about Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:97269:24"/>
with Mr. <hi>Burges,</hi> Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Warner, &amp;c.</hi> and the Doctrine there
vindicated, and in many other Books, (my
<hi>Apology, Life of Faith, &amp;c.)</hi> and to take no
notice of any of theſe Books, and yet call
me before God and Conſcience to a <hi>diligent</hi>
ſearch? If my diligence produced never ſo
much more, are you bound to take any
more notice of them than you did of all
theſe?</p>
            <p>2. How come you to know the mind of
a man, whom I ſuppoſe you never, ſaw, ſo
well as to add your <hi>[Nec dubito quin Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatam
Chriſti Juſtitiam incluſerit?]</hi> Am I
not fitteſt to tell you what I include?</p>
            <p>3. Why turn you a Logical caſe of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining,</hi>
into a Theological <hi>de re? Juſtitia Chriſti
Imputata</hi> is one thing, and the <hi>Definition</hi> of
Juſtice, or Imputation, is another.</p>
            <p>4. Are you in good ſadneſs deſirous to
know whom I mean? I muſt think ſo: But
why did you not as earneſtly ask of the reſt,
What <hi>Rulers</hi> I mean, and what <hi>people I mean,
&amp;c.</hi> Is it not enough to deſcribe them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
I name them? But I will tell you as
much of my meaning as I know my ſelf.</p>
            <p>My meaning is, that if the queſtion be,
What is the ſignification of this or that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,
Arabick, Syriack, Perſian, Greek word,
in the Text and Verſions of the Scripture,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97269:25"/>
or what ſuch a proverbial ſpeech doth ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie?
and ſo of Topography, Genealogy,
Chronology, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> one excellent Hebrician,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> well ſeen in thoſe ſtudies, ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
before the majority of all the Boys,
Students, Preachers, that never underſtood
thoſe things: Muſt I name them? is there
no remedy? Why I mean ſuch a one as
<hi>Pagnine, Montanus, Buxtorf, &amp;c.</hi> for the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew:
ſuch a one as <hi>Erpenius,</hi> Dr. <hi>Pocock,
&amp;c.</hi> for the Arabick: ſuch a one as <hi>Scaliger,
Blondell, Vſher, Broughton, &amp;c.</hi> for Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> If it be a controverſy in <hi>Geometry,</hi>
I would believe Dr. <hi>Wallis, &amp;c.</hi> if in Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy,
Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> Dr. <hi>Lower,</hi> Dr. <hi>Needham,</hi>
before a thouſand that are therein unſtudied:
yea, if it were a Magiſtrate, or Biſhop, that
were of another mind. In Metaphyſicks,
I will believe or regard one <hi>Suarez, Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tado,
Meuriſſe, Schiebler,</hi> Dr. <hi>Barlow,</hi> before
a thouſand that are therein ignorant: in
Phyſicks, I more regard one <hi>Ariſtotle, Scotus,
Honoratus Faber, Campanella,</hi> Mr. <hi>Boyle,
&amp;c.</hi> before all them that never ſtudied them:
And in Logick, I regard one <hi>Ariſtotle, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
Dietericus, Burgerſdicius, Hurtado, &amp;c.</hi>
before all that never ſtudied Logick, of what
Coat or Calling ſoever. Accordingly in
<hi>Method</hi> and <hi>Defining,</hi> I prefer one ſuch Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
as <hi>Sohnius, Cluto, Wendeline, Ameſius,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97269:25"/>
Dud Fenner,</hi> Dr. <hi>Stoughton,</hi> Mr. <hi>G. Lawſon,
&amp;c.</hi> before all thoſe that are ignorant of
Method and Definition: while I prefer the
happineſs of many a poor woman that hath
<hi>a ſtrong Faith, and cannot define it,</hi> before
ſome Doctors that can define that which they
have not. Thus your loud Call hath drawn
out an expoſition, which I once thought
would have been vain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 46.</hi> But it may be you would know
<hi>what their names are whom I take to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
[Definers of Juſtification, Faith and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,]</hi>
than all the unskilful Students, or
others, that want their Logical and Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
ſufficiency? You that are an Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Doctor, ſhould be better acquainted
with the beſt Logicians and School-Divines
than I. I once thought you had been one
of them: If there be no remedy, I will tell
you who I think have delivered us far more
judicious and digeſted thoughts of theſe
things, (both definitions, diſtinctions, and
the matter it ſelf,) than I find in this your
Treatiſe: namely, <hi>Vinc. le Blanc,</hi> Mr. <hi>Will.
Bradſhaw,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Anth. Wotton,</hi> (two old
Non-Conformiſts,) <hi>Placeus, Amyraldus,
Dallaeus, Teſtardus, Conrad, &amp; Johannes Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gii,
Lud. Crocius, Maſtrickt, Matth. Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
Camero, Grotius,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lawſon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:97269:26"/>
Mr. <hi>John Ball,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gibbons,</hi> (late of
<hi>Black-fryers,)</hi> Mr. <hi>Truman,</hi> (in his great
Propitiat. <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> (three Non-Conformiſts,)
Mr. <hi>Gataker, &amp;c.</hi> I name them but as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
them.</p>
            <p>And now Sir, was this a task worthy ſo
ſolemn an invitation before God, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and the World? If I ſhould name
Mr. <hi>Hotchkis</hi> of Pardon, Mr. <hi>Benj. Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>
and many more ſuch Writers, I pray
you ſay not that I ſend you to School to
them: I do but anſwer your earneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 47.</hi> But, 4. I alſo intreat you to tell
me, whether you differ from me in the rule
of counſel which I there gave the ignorant
people, or not? If you did not, you would
never have given me ſuch a ſummons. If
you do; deal openly with your Scholars and
the World, and tell them, whether your
meaning be, that the major vote of thoſe
that never read Logick, Phyſicks, Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicks,
Law, Medicine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
before one <hi>Ariſtotle, Downame, Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſendus,
Zabarell, Grotius, Cook, Littleton,
Cujacius, Fernelius, &amp;c.</hi> Tell your Scholars
that you are <hi>but one,</hi> and they are many, and
muſt believe themſelves before you, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining
Juſtification, Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Tell all the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97269:26"/>
Univerſity, that thus they muſt uſe their
Tutors. Should Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi>'s Church of
Separatiſts have judged of all his critical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
by the major vote? Tell the World
that all the Criticks, and Dr. <hi>Walton</hi>'s La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
and all ſuch mens, muſt ſtand or fall
at the judgment of the majority of people
or Miniſters that never ſtudied thoſe tongues.
(If you think I take my ſelf for one of theſe
Judges, you are quite miſtaken.)</p>
            <p>And I may ask you, Are you not herein a
man ſingular even to admiration? And yet
will you plead thus, as if it were againſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity?
Are not all Proteſtants, Papiſts,
Chriſtians, learned Heathens, agreed of the
Rule that I gave? All your Univerſity, ſave
your ſelf, (I hope in charity) do think that
your Profeſſors, and Readers, and Tutors,
are to be believed in their ſeveral Profeſſions
and Readings, before all their unlearned Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils,
or any others that are ignorant. What
ſort of men in the World are more faulty in
tying up mens Faith too much to men, than
the Papiſts are? And yet I preſume you
know that they commonly acknowledge,
that in Dogmatical difficulties, eſpecially
ſuch as depend on Arts and Sciences, (ſuch
as <hi>Defining</hi> for the moſt part is,) the majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
even in a Council that are therein un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned,

Natural Free-will are, than
many that never ſtudied the point; (though
yet perhaps the beſt of them may deſerve
little regard about unſearchable things.)</p>
            <p>If you pleaſe but to read Mr. <hi>Femble</hi> his
<hi>Vind. Grat.</hi> you will find ſomewhere almoſt
the very words of the rule or ſaying of

            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 48. 5.</hi> But what mean you to bring

you conſider, 1. Whether you do well to

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97269:27"/>
of Faith (between that of <hi>Camero,</hi>

them <hi>one faculty?)</hi> The differences about
the <hi>act,</hi> the <hi>formal object,</hi> the <hi>material object,</hi>
(as whether with <hi>Chamier</hi> we muſt hold,
that the <hi>ſpirits inward teſtimony</hi> that you
are juſtified, be <hi>verbum Dei &amp; Fidei objectum,</hi>
with abundance ſuch) are too too many,
when yet perhaps moſt mean the ſame
thing, and differ but in <hi>Logical notions.</hi>
And do you well to frighten men into ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions
and contentions, out of their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and peace, by telling them that theſe are
<hi>the great truths of God,</hi> and likening them
to the Queſtion, <hi>whether God ſhall be God?</hi>
As if you knew not that by ſuch melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
and phantaſms, the Church hath been
brought into the unhappy, military, diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
ſtate that it is in. It is work fit for a
Divine and Healer, to make the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that the great truths of God, and the
Godhead it ſelf are at the ſtake, in ſuch <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
quarrels,</hi> and that men differ further
than they do?</p>
            <p>6. But did you not ſee that I before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
excepted <hi>all matters neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:97269:28"/>
from humane truſt? (Some will ſay,
I doubt, too far, that ſee not other explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.)</p>
            <p>7. And I beſeech you, is it all one for
<hi>truth to depend on humane ſuffrages (yea,
God himſelf,)</hi> and for an <hi>ignorant man</hi> or
<hi>Scholar to depend on his Teacher,</hi> ſo far as
<hi>fide humana</hi> to <hi>believe him</hi> before ten un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
men? Is this fit doctrine for a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
and Maſter of a Literate Society? Say
then in your Lectures, <q>[Hearers and Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
this and that is the true definition of
Faith and Juſtification, (even of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
ſorts of Faith and Juſtification;)
but while I tell you ſo, regard and believe
what I and many ſuch others ſay to you,
no more than you would do many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned

that I erre, or ſpeak heretically herein;
leſt God and his Truth depend on humane

enquire, 1. Whether it was natural or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural;
2. Wherein it did conſiſt.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, 1. It muſt be underſtood
that the Righteouſneſs which we enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
is, 1. <hi>Qualitative;</hi> the holy inclinations
of the ſoul, called the Image of God: 2. and
<hi>Relative;</hi> the <hi>Innocency</hi> or <hi>Juſtifiableneſs</hi> of
man: but not, 3. the <hi>Active</hi> Righteouſneſs:
for that was, 1. after Creation, 2. freely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by man himſelf: and yet it may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to that as it is denominated from the
<hi>inclining</hi> principle.</p>
            <p>And for the queſtion, 1. As [Natural]
ſignifieth, that which was created in us; or
which we had in the beginning, with our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
from God as our gracious Creator, ſo
<hi>Original</hi> Righteouſneſs was <hi>Natural:</hi> that
is, 1. It was not given him at any time fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
his Creation, 2. Nor was it given at
the ſame time, as a thing diſtinct from the
ſoundneſs, and rectitude, and integrity of
his nature: but was that rectitude it ſelf,
and as much concreated with man, as health
and beauty with the body.</p>
            <p>2. As [natural] ſignifieth that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to the eſſence of man, and is inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
from him; ſo original righteouſneſs
was not natural; no more than health and
beauty are to the body.</p>
            <p>3. As [Natural] ſignifieth that which is
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:97269:31"/>
now propagated and born with us, and
comes by generation to man in his lapſt
eſtate, ſo Original Righteouſneſs is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural.</p>
            <p>4. Though as it ſignifieth that which
would have been propagated to poſterity, if
the Parents had not ſin'd and loſt it, ſo Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Righteouſneſs is natural.</p>
            <p>5. As [Natural] ſignifieth that which
may be recovered, or maintained by meer
natural means; ſo Original Righteouſneſs is
not Natural: for though to <hi>Adam</hi> it was as
natural to the ſoul as health and beauty to
the body, yet 1. He was commanded by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
revelation certain poſitive duties
for the exerciſe and maintaining of it, and
for the attainment of ſalvation, which was
its end. 2. And now we are deprived of
it, we cannot expect the reſtoration but by
means ſupernatural: even by Chriſt, and
the Spirit, and ſupernatural revelations.</p>
            <p>And that Original Righteouſneſs is [Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural]
ſo far as I have ſaid, that is, concreated,
and ſhould have been propagated to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
if not loſt by Parents, I ſhall here prove
by ſeveral Arguments; becauſe I find Dr.
<hi>Taylor</hi> and others that deny Original ſin, do
build on this ſuppoſition, that Infants are
deprived of this Righteouſneſs as ſome ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added
thing; and yet be <hi>in puris naturalibus</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:97269:32"/>
without ſin. But there is no ſuch ſtate, nor
ever was, as a ſtate of <hi>pure nature</hi> in a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
creature, without <hi>holineſs</hi> or <hi>ſin;</hi> as I
prove:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 1.</hi> Man was naturally able and
diſpoſed to know God to be God, and his
God: <hi>go.</hi> He was naturally able and diſpoſed
to love him as God, and his God: which is
the ſum of his Original Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>By <hi>diſpoſed,</hi> I mean morally inclined, and
not void of that holy inclination to love
God, which is the life of morality, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude
of the will.</p>
            <p>The Antecedent is undoubted: if the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
nature had not been diſpoſed to know
God, it had been blind, deformed, and not
fit for the ends of its creation.</p>
            <p>The Conſequence is proved thus. If the
underſtanding had been diſpoſed to know
God, and not the will to love him as God,
then the will would have been created lame,
and deformed, and unfit for the ends of its
creation; and there would have been a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion,
if not a conflict, between the
faculties of the ſoul: but the Conſequent is
not to be admitted: <hi>go.</hi> nor the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 2.</hi> God made not man without all
moral good: <hi>go.</hi> He made him with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to God, (which we call Charity
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:97269:32"/>
in habit, or diſpoſition), which was his
Original Righteouſneſs. We ſpeak not of
<hi>Active</hi> good; for that was to follow his
creation: but of inward <hi>Virtue</hi> in habit or
diſpoſition. The Antecedent is proved:
1. In that elſe he had been imperfect, as to
his end; 2. And not born the Image of
God's goodneſs: and by the other reaſons
hereafter following. And if God made
man without all moral virtue and goodneſs,
then could he loſe and fall from none.</p>
            <p>The conſequence is proved, becauſe there
can be no proper moral good, where the true
principle and end are wanting: but where
the love of God is wanting, the true prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
and end is wanting: <hi>go. &amp;c.</hi> God is the
end: Love is the adheſion to God: Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
and unregenerate men have no moral
good, any further than they have ſome kind
of love to God, and reſpect him as the end:
Which as it is in them but analogically called
love to God, ſo have they but an analogical
morality.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 3.</hi> Man was created in the Image of
God: <hi>go.</hi> he was created in Original Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
which conſiſted in the inclination
of the ſoul to God, as God. The Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
is expreſt in <hi>Gen. 1. 26, 27.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
is proved from <hi>Eph. 4. 24.</hi> with
<hi>Col. 3. 10.</hi> which ſhew that the Image of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:97269:33"/>
God (beſides that which was in our Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials,
in power, underſtanding, and will) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
in wiſdom righteouſneſs, and true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.
It's impoſſible that the moral Image
of God ſhould be without Original Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
and the love of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 4.</hi> God look'd on man when he
had created him, and ſaw that he was very
good, <hi>Gen. 1. 31. go.</hi> he ſaw that he had an
inclination to his Maker, or habitual love to
God: for the rational creature cannot be
very good without it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 5.</hi> If man was made for God as
his ultimate end, then was he made with
Original Righteouſneſs (or an holy inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to love God): but man was made for
God as his ultimate end: <hi>go. &amp;c.</hi> The minor
is certain: Though it be doubtful whether
naturally man could know that he might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
God by immediate viſion of his Glory;
and alſo whether it ſhould be in Heaven or
on Earth, or where; and alſo whether he
could obtain the beatifical viſion without
ſupernatural revelation and aſſiſtance; yet
it was plain, that he was made for God as his
end, that is, to pleaſe him, and to love him,
and be beloved by him, and enjoy him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his capacity: 1. Elſe it had been
no duty of man by nature to intend God as
his end, and to love him above all: 2. And
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:97269:33"/>
it had been no part of his ſin or miſery to
take up ſhort of God: which are falſe, as
ſhall be ſhewed. The major is proved thus:
All the works of God are diſpoſed for the
attainment of their ends: <hi>go.</hi> ſo was man, and
<hi>go.</hi> with Original Righteouſneſs: for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Charity, (in the habit or inclination),
and ſo without Original Righteouſneſs, man
had not been diſpoſed to his end, but had
been left in an unfitneſs, and indifferency, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
no more to God than to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Moreover, man was created with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to good, as good, ſo far as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it; and <hi>go.</hi> with the greateſt inclination
to the greateſt good: but to man in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
integrity God appeared as the greateſt
good; otherwiſe the underſtanding could
not have diſcerned that truth which the
whole creation manifeſted: which is not to
be imagined.</p>
            <p>Moreover, man by nature was inclined to
his own felicity formally, and objectively ſo
far as he knew it: but by nature he knew
God to be <hi>objectively</hi> his felicity; (though he
might not know the immediate viſion, he
could not but know that it was his <hi>happineſs</hi>
to be accepted and beloved by his Maker, and
enjoy him according to his capacity);
<hi>go.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:97269:34"/>
Moreover, no creature can ſatisfie the
mind of man, or fulfil his deſire: <hi>go.</hi> Man in
his natural integrity was inclined to God,
who only can ſatisfy.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it is natural for the creature to
deſire the perfection of that which it had in
imperfection: but it cannot be denied but
<hi>Adam</hi> had ſome knowledge of God, as God,
and ſo as the chief good, and conſequently
ſome inclination to him, (ſuppoſe it never
ſo ſmall): <hi>go.</hi> he naturally deſired to know
and love him perfectly; and <hi>go.</hi> it muſt needs
be that God was his end, and he had Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 6.</hi> Man was naturally obliged to
love God above all, and ſerve and pleaſe him
with all his powers: <hi>go.</hi> he was naturally
diſpoſed hereunto. The Antecedent is
plain; in that God by meer Reſultancy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made man a rational free agent, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to him as his Creator, Lord, and Ruler,
and Benefactor; and man related to him as
his <hi>creature,</hi> as his <hi>own,</hi> as his <hi>ſubject,</hi> and as
his <hi>Beneficiary:</hi> and <hi>go.</hi> muſt needs be bound
by virtue of this relation, to love God with
all his heart, and be thankful to him, and
devoted to his will and ſervice. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
is proved; in that God fitteth all
his creatures to their uſe, not only by a naked
power, but by a convenient inclination for
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:97269:34"/>
the actuating of that power: <hi>go.</hi> he did ſo
by man: he did not lay all this duty on him,
without giving him an aptitude and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
ſuitable thereto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 7.</hi> The contrary Doctrine too much
favoureth Infidelity, as to mans immortal
happineſs with God.</p>
            <p>For, 1. If mans nature, as compleated by
the Creator, was not made for, and ſuited
and diſpoſed to the fruition of God in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
ſuper-added Grace and Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
muſt be conceived to make man as it
were another creature, and give him another
nature; and ſo that God ſhould preſently
change the nature that he had newly made;
and that Grace were to make man <hi>holy,</hi> as if
it were to make a beaſt to be a man, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
him above the tendency of all his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
perfections: which will ſeen impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.
2. It denieth all the arguments for
the immortality of the ſoul, that are fetch'd
from nature: which is not to be done. If
the nature of the ſoul can prove its immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
it muſt accordingly prove its immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
happineſs, or miſery; for a neutral ſtate
cannot thence be proved: and <hi>go.</hi> it muſt
prove that happineſs to be in the love of
God; and ſo that the ſoul was inclined to
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 8.</hi> There is no word of God, that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:97269:35"/>
mentioneth the ſuper-adding of Original
Righteouſneſs, by any following gift of
God, diſtinct from our creation: <hi>go.</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
by divine Faith be believed that ſuch a
following gift there was.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 9.</hi> Regeneration is mans reparation
and reſtoration to God: <hi>go.</hi> man fell from
God; and ſo from the love of God: and
it is the reparation of that Image of God in
which he was created, <hi>Col. 3. 10. Eph. 4.
24.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 10.</hi> It is expreſly ſaid, <hi>Eccl. 7. 29.</hi>
that <hi>God made man upright:</hi> but his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
was his <hi>uprightneſs: go.</hi> he alſo made
him <hi>righteous.</hi> So much of that queſtion.</p>
            <p>2. As to the next queſtion, <hi>Wherein Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Righteouſneſs doth conſiſt;</hi> 1. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth
in the ſouls inclination to God as
God; that is in the habit or diſpoſition, or
propenſity of the ſoul to love God for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
as the infinite good, and alſo as our fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.
2. In the underſtandings diſpoſition
to know God as one to be thus beloved.
3. In a holy vivacity Godward. 4. In the
ordination and ſubjection of all the inferior
faculties to the underſtanding and will thus
inclined. 5. And <hi>relatively,</hi> in the <hi>innocency</hi>
hence reſulting.</p>
            <p>And now we may hence ſee what <hi>original
ſin is.</hi> In <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf the firſt ſin was
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:97269:35"/>
               <hi>actual,</hi> and thence followed the <hi>habitual pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity:</hi>
in us the firſt in order of nature is
<hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>ſin imputed juſtly,</hi> becauſe we were
<hi>in him,</hi> and in our <hi>immediate Parents,</hi> who
derived it from him; and herewith is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
the <hi>pravity</hi> or <hi>corruption</hi> of our <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
which containeth theſe things follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
1. The privation of the <hi>true love of
God,</hi> as our principal end, to be loved for
himſelf, and as our felicity; and herewith
the privation of the love of holineſs, his
image: and ſo of the rectitude of the will.
2. The privation of the true and ſavoury
knowledge of God and his image, and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of them. Here note that it is the
privation of the inclination, diſpoſition or
habit that I ſpeak of, and not of the act.
3. In a deadneſs and inactivity Godwards.
4. In the inordinate adheſion or inclination
of the ſenſitive appetite to its objects. 5. In
the inordinate inclination of the will to our
ſelves, eſpecially our carnal intereſt. The
matter of original ſin is in theſe.</p>
            <p>II. For the explication of the <hi>Theſis,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
that theſe things may be noted, beſides
what is ſaid.</p>
            <p>1. It is <hi>original ſin</hi> (increaſed by our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
acts) that hindereth us from <hi>knowing ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſin.</hi> As it is the <hi>ophthalmie,</hi> or <hi>gutta
ſerena,</hi> or <hi>ſuffuſion,</hi> that hindreth the eye, by
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:97269:36"/>
the glaſs to ſee its own diſeaſe. Original ſin
lieth very much in an inordinate <hi>ſelf-love,</hi>
or <hi>ſelfiſh inclination:</hi> and the more any
man hath of that, the more unwilling and
unapt he is to <hi>know it:</hi> and much more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt
to be truly humbled for it; and <hi>go.</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified
men that are ſtrangers to true <hi>ſelf-denial,</hi>
are apt to plead againſt the being of
original ſin, and are hardly brought to know
it in themſelves.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Sin</hi> is a word that's uſually and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
taken ſo largely as to contain <hi>all moral
evil;</hi> or all defects, inclinations and actions
contrary to the rule of holineſs and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
and deſerving any puniſhment: and
thus we take it in the queſtion. But ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>ſin</hi> is taken more <hi>narrowly,</hi> as ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only the <hi>actual tranſgreſſion of the Law;</hi>
but we take it not ſo narrowly here (for one
kind of ſin only).</p>
            <p>3. Some ſins have a <hi>greater degree of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,</hi>
or malignity in them than ſome
others have: and ſo when we ſay that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
have original ſin,</hi> we do not equal it in
<hi>degree</hi> of <hi>malignity</hi> with the ſins of the
adult. <hi>Materially</hi> there is more malignity
or oppoſition to God, in <hi>original,</hi> than in
ordinary <hi>actual</hi> ſins: but <hi>formally</hi> there is
more <hi>culpability</hi> in many <hi>actual ſins,</hi> than in
<hi>original ſin,</hi> becauſe they are more fully <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:97269:36"/>
and in our power. Yet the <hi>confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
ſinful habits of the adult,</hi> where <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſin</hi> is <hi>ſtrengthened</hi> by actual, are worſt
of all: ſo that as <hi>Accidens</hi> is ſaid to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Ens</hi> but by analogy of <hi>attribution,</hi> as
having a leſs participation of the kind; and
yet it is truly <hi>Ens:</hi> ſo the <hi>original ſin</hi> of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
is called <hi>ſin</hi> by ſuch an analogy, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a leſs participation of the common na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of ſin, in the form and culpability.</p>
            <p>4. In ſuch a degree as <hi>infants</hi> are <hi>ſubjects</hi>
of Chriſt's <hi>Kingdom,</hi> in ſuch a degree alſo
their <hi>original pravity</hi> is properly <hi>ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. In ſuch a degree as their <hi>Parents
righteouſneſs</hi> would have been imputable to
them, if none of their Anceſtors from the
creation had ſinned; and as their own <hi>inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
holineſs</hi> is imputable to the <hi>ſanctified in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants</hi>
as a moral good: in ſuch a degree al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
is their progenitors ſin imputed to them,
and their <hi>original pravity</hi> imputed to them
as a <hi>moral evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. We do not aſſert that any of the <hi>adult</hi>
are damned for original ſin alone; nor that
their original ſin is a remedileſs evil: but
that a remedy is provided, and means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for men to uſe, in order to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
from the guilt and pravity; which
if they refuſe, they lie under a double
guilt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:97269:37"/>
7. Original ſin, and the miſery deſerved
and due to the ſubject, is a remediable evil
in infants themſelves: As their Parents have
propagated a ſinful guilty nature to them,
ſo if their Parents will unfeignedly dedicate
them to Chriſt, and offer and engage them to
God in the holy Covenant, which Baptiſme
is the ſign and ſeal of, they ſhall be accepted
by God, according to the tenor of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
            <p>8. Our queſtion extendeth not to the
<hi>degree</hi> of infants puniſhment, whether they
ſhall have more or leſs? whether pain of
loſs only, or of ſenſe alſo, or how far?</p>
            <p>9. An ordinary occaſion of ſeducing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
into the denial of original ſin, is, the
equalling God's Laws with the Laws of
man; (which yet afford much matter for
their confutation). Man's Laws meddle
not ſo much with the <hi>heart,</hi> and are not a
rule for mens ſecret thoughts, diſpoſitions
and inclinations, as God's Laws are; for
man knoweth not the heart, nor is made the
judge of it, further than it is manifeſted by
words or deeds: but the heart is as open to
God as the actions, and the diſtempers of it
as loathſome to him: and <hi>go.</hi> his Laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
even vitious diſpoſitions and habits as
ſuch.</p>
            <p>10. The will is the firſt defiled faculty
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:97269:37"/>
and ſeat of ſin: and all the reſt of the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are capable of ſin, but ſecondarily, and
by participation from the will: and there is
a threefold voluntarineſs. 1. There is an
<hi>actual voluntarineſs,</hi> or <hi>volition.</hi> 2. An <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi>
or <hi>diſpoſitive</hi> voluntarineſs. 3. A <hi>moral,</hi>
that is, a <hi>reputative</hi> voluntarineſs. This laſt
may be in ſeveral caſes diſtinct from the two
former. 1. In caſe a man by contract en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
himſelf to ſtand to what another doth:
though that other do ſomewhat that is
againſt his will in the thing, yet his conſent
to the general hath made him guilty, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>reputatively willing</hi> of it. 2. In caſe a
man <hi>will</hi> the <hi>cauſe</hi> of a <hi>neceſſary effect,</hi> or any
way promote that effect, when he ſhould not,
he is reputatively willing of the effect.
3. In caſe a man by conſent be a member of
a <hi>ſociety,</hi> whoſe conſtitution engageth all
the members in a participation of their acts,
and the conſequents; ſo that what is done
by a major vote, is taken as the act of all, as
to the good or evil conſequents: here every
member is reputatively an offender when
the ſociety offendeth, ſo far as that conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
engaged them.</p>
            <p>4. In caſe of a <hi>natural power</hi> that another
hath to chooſe or refuſe for us: and this is
the caſe of <hi>Parents</hi> and their <hi>infants,</hi> and
<hi>ideot children,</hi> that having no capacity
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97269:38"/>
themſelves to chooſe or refuſe, their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
wills are reputatively their wills, in
all caſes wherein their Parents have
power to diſpoſe of them; as it is in caſes
of inheritance among us. So in Baptiſm
the Parents have power to engage the child
to Chriſt, as all the Jews had power (and
were bound) to engage their children in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
to God: where the child reputative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſenteth. So <hi>Adam</hi> having power to
retain or reject that righteouſneſs of nature
which then he was poſſeſſed of, and might
have derived to his poſterity, and to chooſe
life or death for himſelf, and (in ſome ſort)
for his poſterity, we reputatively refuſed life
in his refuſal or rejection.</p>
            <p>III. I come now to the proof of the <hi>Theſis,
[that infants</hi> have original ſin].</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. From <hi>Rom. 5. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
17, 18.</hi> If all have ſinned, then infants have
ſinned; (and that can be only by original
ſin). But all have ſinned: <hi>go.</hi> infants have
ſinned. Whether <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> be <hi>[in whom]</hi> or [in
that] or [foraſmuch as] I make no great
matter of. (Though I ſee no reaſon but
with the vulgar Latin, and others, we ſhould
turn it <hi>[in quo]).</hi> If infants have ſin, it is as
much as I am proving. The minor is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
affirmed in <hi>ver. 12. [all have ſinned];</hi>
which is rendred in other words, <hi>ver. 19.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:97269:38"/>
[many were made ſinners].</hi> The conſequence
of the major can have nothing ſaid againſt
it, but that by [All] is meant only <hi>[All the
adult],</hi> and infants are excluded. But this
is ſuch wilful violence to the Text, as that
all Scripture may by ſuch interpretation be
eluded, and words ſhall ſignify nothing.
1. The expreſs univerſal affirmation may
not be expounded by reſtraining terms,
without ſome cogent reaſon: but here is no
cogent reaſon brought, nor can be: all the
reaſon of the adverſaries is but the point
now in queſtion, which if they may beg,
they may thence deny all Texts that be
againſt them, becauſe they are againſt them.</p>
            <p>2. It is <hi>all men that die</hi> that the Apoſtle
ſpeaketh of: but <hi>infants die: go.</hi> he ſpeaks
of infants. The major is plain, <hi>v. 12. [Death
by ſin; and ſo death paſſed upon all men, for
that all have ſinned].</hi> Here <hi>the ſinners</hi> and
<hi>dyers</hi> are made the ſame; and more than ſo,
death is the effect of their <hi>[having ſinned]:</hi>
it <hi>go.</hi> paſſeth upon all men, for that all have
ſinned; <hi>go.</hi> not without their ſin. And the
next verſes fullier prove it purpoſely. Where
death reigneth, there ſin is imputed: but
death reigneth on infants; <hi>go.</hi> ſin is imputed
to infants: and alſo the [All] before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
includeth them; for it is the ſame
perſons that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in theſe
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97269:39"/>
verſes, 12, 13, 14. The major is proved
from the 13 and 14 verſes, elſe the Apoſtle's
argument were vain; for this is his <hi>medium</hi>
to prove that ſin was imputed before the
Law, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe death reigned before the
Law, even from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes: go.</hi> the reign
of death will prove the imputation of ſin;
which is the ſame with [having ſinned],
mentioned, <hi>ver. 12.</hi> It is the [all that have
ſinned] that are ſaid to have ſin imputed to
them.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>All</hi> that have ſinned, <hi>ver. 12.</hi> are
the ſame <hi>All</hi> that <hi>are made righteous,</hi> and have
the <hi>juſtification of life,</hi> and that <hi>ſhall reign
in life by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ver. 16, 17, 18, 19.
(This is plain in the Context, in the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition):
But <hi>infants</hi> are included in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
All [that ſhall reign in life by Jeſus
Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.] go. infants</hi> are included in the
former All [that have ſinned]. He that
denieth the minor, muſt deny not only the
Baptiſm, but the juſtification and ſalvation
of all infants.</p>
            <p>4. All old interpretations which the
Churches have uſed, (that are now moſt
known), do ſhew, that thus they underſtood
the Text. The <hi>Syriack</hi> turns it by <hi>[ſo
death paſſed on all the ſons of men, for that
all have ſinned].</hi> The <hi>Arabick [ſeeing all
have now ſinned]</hi> referring to that paſt ſin.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:97269:39"/>
The <hi>Ethiopick</hi> thus, <hi>[And as by the iniquity
of one man ſin entred into the World, and by
that ſin death came upon all men, becauſe that
ſin is imputed to all men, even to them that
knew not what that ſin is].</hi> Here is a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe
inſtead of a Verſion, more fully to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
this ſenſe. The <hi>[in quo]</hi> makes the
ſenſe of the Latin Interpreter paſt doubt.
This is the firſt argument from theſe verſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. from the ſame verſes, eſpecially 18:
They that are under <hi>condemnation</hi> by <hi>Adam</hi>'s
ſin, have original ſin (at leaſt the imputed
part). But infants are under <hi>condemnation</hi> for
<hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin: <hi>go.</hi> infants have original ſin. If I
prove no more but that [they are under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation]
for the minor it is enough: for
the conſequence is thence apparent. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
is plain, in that condemnation is only for
ſin, (and infants have no ſin but original):
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is as eſſentially related to <hi>culpa,</hi> as
<hi>poena</hi> is. The minor is proved from <hi>ver. 18.
[By the offence of one judgment came on all
men to condemnation]:</hi> or as the <hi>Syriack</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
it, <hi>[For the offence of one condemnation
is on all]:</hi> or as the <hi>Ethiopick, [All men are
condemned];</hi> ſo <hi>ver. 15. [Through the offence
of one many are dead.]</hi> That <hi>[All men]</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
<hi>infants</hi> here, the former arguments
prove. This one <hi>18 th. ver.</hi> of <hi>Rom. 5.</hi> were
there no more in all the Scripture, is ſo plain
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97269:40"/>
for an imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin on all to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
that it might end the controverſy.</p>
            <p>Both major and minor I yet further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm.
1. That it is a condemnation proving
the condemned to be ſinners by juſt impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
is manifeſt, 1. in that <hi>ver. 13, 14.</hi> ſin
is hence ſaid to be <hi>imputed to the ſufferers:
2. ver. 12.</hi> they are ſaid to <hi>have ſinned:
3. ver. 19.</hi> they are ſaid to be <hi>made ſinners.</hi>
If any ſay that this ſignifieth but metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mically,
<hi>[to be uſed as ſinners];</hi> I anſwer,
1. He that would make what his liſt of God's
plain words by pretended unproved meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymies,
is not to be believed. 2. If it were
true, yet it muſt mean ſuch a <hi>uſing men as
ſinners,</hi> as implyeth them to be juſtly ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
and their being <hi>ſinners</hi> muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted
as the cauſe, as it is in all puniſhment.
It is ſurely a <hi>penal evil</hi> to the adult, by the
adverſaries confeſſion: and here's no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction.
3. To be <hi>[made righteous],</hi> which
is the oppoſite member, is more than to be
[uſed as righteous, though we have no ſin
at all inherent or imputed: <hi>go.</hi> to be <hi>[made
ſinners]</hi> is more than to be [uſed as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
though we have no ſin at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent,
or imputed]. 4. That evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
doth but accuſe God of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,
of which anon.</p>
            <p>2. And for the minor, it is ſufficient to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97269:40"/>
prove that infants are included; 1. Becauſe
infants die on this account. 2. Becauſe it is
a <hi>[being made ſinners by one man's diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
ver. 19.] and a being <hi>[dead, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
condemnation through one man's of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence],</hi>
as <hi>ver. 15. 18.</hi> that is mentioned;
and thoſe that are now adult, had their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
in infancy to <hi>Adam</hi>'s offence as well
as after. It is not actual ſin that brings them
to be thus related to <hi>Adam.</hi> It is both by
one offence, <hi>ver. 18.</hi> and by the offence of
one, <hi>ver. 17.</hi> and <hi>ver. 15.</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>],
<hi>in</hi> or <hi>by the ſin of one.</hi> It is not <hi>go.</hi>
the effect of actual ſins of the adult, that
the Apoſtle here principally ſpeaks of, (much
leſs, <hi>only</hi> them): but it is the participation and
imputation of that one mans offence, which
he oppoſeth to the righteouſneſs of one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. from the puniſhment of infants.
If infants are puniſhed, they have original
ſin. But infants are puniſhed, <hi>go.</hi> they have
original ſin; (for they have no other). The
conſequence is certain, becauſe it is eſſential
to puniſhment to be <hi>propter malum morale,</hi>
the effect of ſin as the meritorious cauſe.
All that requireth proof is the minor, which
I have proved at large in another diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(of the guilt of our immediate Parents
ſins). To which I add; 1. God doth not
(ordinarily at leaſt) afflict any rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97269:41"/>
with death, but for their ſin. But God
doth ordinarily afflict infants even with
death: <hi>go.</hi> he doth it for their ſin. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
is too well known. The major I prove
thus: 1. In the lamentations of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> the
pains of the ſucking children are mentioned
often among the reſt: and of all its ſaid,
<hi>ch. 3. 33. [For he doth not afflict willingly,
nor grieve the children of men];</hi> that is, He
doth it not till he be provoked by their ſins.
But if he afflict even unto death, all infants
(that ſo die) in the World without their
deſert by ſin, then he doth it willingly; even
becauſe he will do it, without their demerit.
But <hi>[wherefore doth a living man complain?
a man for the puniſhment of his ſin?</hi> ver. 39.]
Though it be the adult that principally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
yet this intimateth that all ſuffer for
their ſin.</p>
            <p>Ezek. 18. 23. <hi>[Have I any pleaſure at all
that the wicked ſhould die, ſaith the Lord
God?] 32. [For I have no pleaſure in the
death of him that dieth, ſaith the Lord God].</hi>
Ezek. 33. 11. <hi>[Say unto them, As I live, ſaith
the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death
of the wicked.</hi> Much leſs hath he ſo much
pleaſure in the death of innocents, as to kill
them ordinarily without their deſert. <hi>Rom.
6. 23. [The wages of ſin is death:]</hi> Scripture
ſpeaks of no other death to man, but what is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:97269:41"/>
the fruit of ſin. <hi>1 Cor. 15. [In</hi> Adam <hi>all die;]</hi>
and <hi>Gen. 3. 19. [Duſt thou art, and to duſt
thou ſhalt return,]</hi> extends to all the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of <hi>Adam</hi> (ordinarily); which ſhews
ſome participation in the ſin: or elſe why
ſhould we all participate ſo much of the
ſuffering for it. <hi>1 Cor. 15. 26. [The laſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
that ſhall be deſtroyed is death].</hi> By <hi>enemy</hi>
is meant a <hi>penal evil,</hi> which Chriſt was to
remove as our Redeemer: <hi>go.</hi> even to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
death is a penal evil. <hi>1 Cor. 15. 56. [The
ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is
the Law];</hi> that is, As a ſerpent could not
wound us without its ſting, ſo neither could
death have any power over us to kill us, but
for ſin: nor ſin have any force to oblige us
to this puniſhment, but by the Law. This
is ſpoken of the death of <hi>infants</hi> as well as
others, (unleſs you will deny their reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection):
<hi>go.</hi> ſin is the ſting, that is, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
cauſe, even of their death. <hi>Mic. 1. 5.
[For the tranſgreſſion of</hi> Jacob <hi>is all this, and
for the ſins of the houſe of</hi> Iſrael]. Hence <hi>Satan</hi>
is ſaid to have the power of death, <hi>Heb 2. 14.</hi>
as the executioner of God's wrath for ſin;
from whom Chriſt delivereth us.</p>
            <p>2. If the death of infants be an <hi>act</hi> of
God's juſtice on them, then it is a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
(for it is no act of remunerative
juſtice, <hi>go.</hi> it muſt be of punitive juſtice, if
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97269:42"/>
of any). But it is an act of God's juſtice on
them; as I prove. 1. It is the execution
of God's <hi>ſentence, Gen. 3. 19. go.</hi> it is an act
of his juſtice on them that were ſentenced:
which was mankind.</p>
            <p>2. It is their <hi>condemnation, Rom. 5. 18.
go.</hi> it is an act of juſtice on them.</p>
            <p>3. Subjects are ordinarily ſecured from
being by their Soveraigns put to death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any deſert of theirs, even by the juſtice
of the Soveraign: but infants are God's
ſubjects: <hi>go.</hi> ordinarily they are ſecured by
his juſtice from being put to death by him
without any deſert of theirs.</p>
            <p>The major is proved, 1. From the very
nature of Government and Juſtice. Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Juſtice conſiſteth in giving to all the
ſubjects according to their deſerts, <hi>ut bonis
bene ſit, &amp; malis male: go.</hi> to kill the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and that ordinarily, is contrary to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
Juſtice. 2. From the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Scripture; which conſtantly threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the ſinner, and only the ſinner, and
promiſeth good to them that ſin not. Now
the contrary opinion, 1. either denieth God
to be a King to infants, (of which anon); or,
2. denieth his Juſtice, 3. and nullifieth the
uſe of his Law, which is to be <hi>Norma ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicii.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That infants are God's ſubjects, is
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:97269:42"/>
proved, 1. In that they are of the number of
reaſonable creatures, (though yet they have
not the uſe of reaſon, and <hi>go.</hi> are not perfect
members of his Kingdom). 2. In that they
are to be entred into the holy Covenant with
him, as his ſubjects, <hi>(Deut. 29. &amp;c.)</hi> 3. In
that they have promiſes and threatnings in
his Laws. 4. They are ſubjects in all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Common-wealths, which are but
parts of his univerſal Kingdom. But this
I have proved at large in my Treatiſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
Church-memberſhip and Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj. But God is an abſolute Lord as well
as a King or Ruler, and</hi> go. <hi>may do with his
own as he liſt. Anſw.</hi> His dominion or
propriety is in order of nature antecedent to
his Government or Kingdom, and ſo in that
antecedent inſtant he may do with his own
what he will; and ſo he may ſtill: but then
by becoming a Governor to the rational na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he thereby ſignifieth that he <hi>will</hi> give
to all according to their works, or moral
aptitude; for God cannot be an unjuſt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor;
nor without juſtice. And his Laws
do ſignifie this yet more.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the contrary opinion over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth
all our conſolation, and leaveth us
uncertain whether God will not damn all the
godly; at leaſt it denieth them any comfort
from the light or law of Nature, and the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97269:43"/>
juſtice of God, though they had no ſin of
their own. For if God notwithſtanding
all his Governing Juſtice, may and do or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
kill the innocent becauſe he is an
abſolute Lord, then he may damn the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
hereafter for ought we know notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
his governing juſtice: For inſtance,
the adverſaries muſt on the ſame grounds
ſay, that for ought they know all infants
that die in infancy are damned. For God
may, no queſtion, torment his own, as he is
an abſolute owner of them, as well as kill
them. And if his natural juſtice give no
ſecurity from damnation to the innocent,
then neither can his righteous Laws, and
then they can have no ſecurity at all: which
is falſe and injurious to God and man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj. Bruits die without their deſert.
Anſw.</hi> God is not the Rector of bruits, nor
are they his ſubjects, and <hi>go.</hi> he is not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
by any relation to deal with them in
juſtice, nor are they capable of juſtice, remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerative
or vindictive, nor are they under
any Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 4.</hi> Infants are capable of moral
good, (and have ſuch): <hi>go.</hi> infants are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of moral evil, (and have it). The
capacity is the chief thing in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy:
for if we prove that they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of having virtue or vice in habit or
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:97269:43"/>
diſpoſition, without conſent, then I find none
that will deny the conſequence, that <hi>de facto</hi>
they have it. That infants have moral
good, is proved thus: 1. Elſe they could not
be inwardly ſanctified: 2. Elſe they did not
morally differ one from another: 3. And ſo
one were no more amiable to God than
another: 4. Nor one any more fit for Heaven
than another: and ſo none ſhould be ſaved
that die in infancy, as being unqualified for
ſalvation: or if holineſs inherent be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
then all might be ſaved as well as any.
5. And then Baptiſm, nor any priviledges of
holy birth, or dedication to God, could give
no hope of any moral good upon them.
6. And thus they are made meer bruits that
are capable of no moral good or evil. All
which are moſt abſurd, and diſproved in my
Treatiſe of Infant Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>The conſequence is undeniable. If they
are capable of moral good, without actual
moral volitions, ſo are they of moral evil:
for there is <hi>eadem ratio.</hi> If a diſpoſition to
holy action be a moral good or virtue, then
a diſpoſition to evil actions is vice or moral
evil.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 5.</hi> Infants have a privation of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
good: but a privation of moral good is
a moral evil: <hi>go.</hi> infants have a moral evil.
The major is proved, in that <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97269:44"/>
ſhould have been born in original righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
or moral goodneſs, if he had not
ſinned: <hi>go.</hi> it is a privation of a moral good
to be born without it, and not a meer nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The minor is undeniable; privations
belonging by reduction to the kind of that
which they are a privation of: elſe a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would be but a meer negation; that is,
no privation at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 6.</hi> All that are the members of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, and ſaved by him, or for whom
he died as a Redeemer, are (when exiſtent)
ſinners: but infants are the members of
Chriſt, and ſaved by him; he is their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
and died for them: <hi>go.</hi> they are
(when exiſtent) ſinners: <hi>go.</hi> they have ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſin. The major I prove from <hi>Matth.
1. 21. [Thou ſhalt call his name Jeſus, for he
ſhall ſave his people from their ſins].</hi> If it be
the very reaſon of his denomination, (why
he is called a Saviour), becauſe he ſaveth his
people from their ſins, then he is a Saviour
to none but ſinners: but the antecedent is
true: <hi>go. &amp;c.</hi> The antecedent is in the Text
moſt plain. The conſequence is undeniable;
becauſe the eſſence or formal reaſon deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minateth:
<hi>go.</hi> he can be called a Saviour to
none other. And to prevent all cavils, note
that, 1. it is ſin it ſelf, and not meer ſuffering,
much leſs undeſerved ſuffering that conno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:97269:44"/>
not ſin as the cauſe, that is here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
2. That it is [their ſin], and not
other mens ſin, that they are ſaid to be ſaved
from. Nothing <hi>go.</hi> but violence can evade
this evidence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Matth. 9. 12. The whole need not a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian,
but the ſick.</hi> To be ſick is to be ſinful:
to be a Phyſitian is to be the Saviour: <hi>go.</hi>
thoſe that have no ſin have no need of a
Saviour.</p>
            <p>Eph. 5. 23, 25, 26, 27. [Chriſt is the Head
of the Church, and Saviour of the Body]: <hi>and
how doth he ſave them?</hi> [Chriſt loved the
Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might
ſanctifie and cleanſe it with the waſhing of
water by the word; that he might preſent it
to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot
or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing]. <hi>So that to
be a Saviour to the body, is to ſanctifie,
cleanſe, and waſh it, that it may be without

               <hi>His work on the Croſs was to</hi> purge, <hi>or</hi>
make purgation of ſin, Heb. 1. 3. He died
for our ſins, <hi>1 Cor. 15. 3.</hi> He died for us
while we were ſinners and enemies, to reconcile
us to God, <hi>Rom. 5. 6, 8, 10.</hi> He came to give

Who his own ſelf bare our ſins in his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

<hi>1 Pet. 3. 18.</hi> Chriſt our Paſſover is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacrificed

of the tranſgreſſions under the firſt
Teſtament, they that are called might receive
the promiſe of eternal inheritance, <hi>Heb. 9.
12, 14, 15.</hi> He is the propitiation for the ſins
of the whole World, <hi>1 Joh. 2. 2.</hi> If one died
for all, then were all dead, <hi>2 Cor. 5. 14. that

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:97269:45"/>
Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the
World. A multitude of ſuch paſſages of
Scripture tell us, that Chriſt's death was for
ſinners only; and <hi>go.</hi> that he died for none
but ſinners: for what need had the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
of a ſatisfaction to Juſtice, and of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
and Ranſome, and Redemption?
No one text of Scripture can be produced,
in which Chriſt is ſaid to die for any that
had no ſin, or to be the Redeemer or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
of any ſuch. And <hi>go.</hi> to ſay that he
died for infants, to procure them ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Grace, and Heaven, and not to ſave
them from their ſin, is vain. Scripture
knows no ſuch deſign of Chriſt's death.
And the very privation of that rectitude
which they call ſupernatural grace, is ſin; as
is manifeſted: nor can a rational creature be
ſhut out of Heaven, but penally for his ſins;
it being a very grievous puniſhment.</p>
            <p>And for the minor, (that Chriſt died for
infants, and is their Saviour, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> it's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
1. In that he is oft ſaid to die for all
the World. 2. In that there is no other name
under Heaven given by which we can be
ſaved. 3. In that he hath taken infants into
his Church and Covenant, before and ſince
his incarnation: and took them in his arms
and bleſſed them, and ſaid his Kingdom was
of ſuch. 4. In that he would have gathered
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:97269:46"/>
the Jewiſh infants with their Parents into
his Church, <hi>Matth. 23. 37.</hi> 5. Elſe they are
not Chriſtians, (no not imperfect ones), nor
to be baptized. Many more proofs I have
given in the foreſaid Treatiſe of Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.
And few I think deny the minor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 7.</hi> All that ought to be baptized
with the Chriſtian Baptiſm, are ſinners. But
ſome infants ought to be baptized with the
Chriſtian Baptiſm: <hi>go.</hi> they are ſinners.</p>
            <p>The minor I ſhall ſuppoſe to be proved in
the foreſaid Treatiſe. The major I have
proved at large in my Diſput. of Right to
Sacraments: eſpecially <hi>pag. 79, 80.</hi> where
it's proved that Chriſt hath commanded or
inſtituted no other Baptiſm but what is [for
remiſſion of ſin:] (to <hi>p. 88.)</hi> The ſign it
ſelf (the waſhing by water, and burying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, and riſing from under) ſheweth that
this is eſſential in the ſignification: what
elſe but ſin are we to be waſhed from?</p>
            <p>Read over all the texts of Scripture that
ſpeak of Baptiſm, as inſtituted by Chriſt;
and when you have found that no one of
them intimateth ſuch a thing as baptizing
them that are no ſinners, waſhing them that
are not unclean, then tell us why we ſhould
believe that there is ſuch a thing. Nay it
importeth a falſe diſſimulation with God;
when we will aſſert infants to be waſhed by
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:97269:46"/>
the blood of Chriſt, when we believe that
they have no ſin, and need no ſuch waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 8.</hi> If infants have no ſin, they muſt
either never come to Judgment, or be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the Law, or their meer innocency,
without remiſſion by a Redeemer: but the
conſequent is falſe: <hi>go.</hi> ſo is the antecedent.
The conſequence is undeniable, in that no
juſtice can condemn the innocent: the Law
will juſtify them that have no ſin; for its
commination hath nothing againſt them:
ſuch <hi>go.</hi> need not pardon by a Redeemer.</p>
            <p>The falſhood of both parts of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
is proved eaſily. 1. Many Scriptures
ſhew that <hi>all men ſhall be judged, Heb. 9. 27.
all that die.</hi> Rom. 14. 12. Joh. 5. 28, 29.
<hi>all that are in the graves;</hi> with many ſuch
places. 2. If infants be not judged, they
would neither be juſtified nor condemned:
but that's not true, <hi>go. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. And that all infants (nor any) are not
juſtified by the Law, or their own Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
is plain in the Apoſtle's arguings, <hi>Rom. 3.
4,</hi> and 5. throughout: and in the Epiſt. to
<hi>Galat. Rom. 3. 20. by the deeds of the Law
there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight.
Rom. 4.</hi> proveth that even to <hi>Abraham</hi> and
his ſeed juſtification was by remiſſion of ſin
through faith in Chriſt, and not by the Law,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:97269:47"/>
or their own innocency. And if it was ſo
with <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed, it is ſo ſtill with our
ſeed.</p>
            <p>Arg. 9. Rom. 3. 23. 9, 10, &amp;c. All have
ſinned, and come ſhort of the Glory of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
juſtified freely by his Grace, through the
redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt, whom God
hath ſet forth to be a propitiation, &amp;c. go.
<hi>infants have ſinned, and come ſhort of the
Glory of God, and muſt be juſtified by this
propitiation for ſin.</hi> Ver. 9. We have before
proved that Jews and Gentiles are all under
ſin. <hi>Ver. 19.</hi> That every mouth may be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
and all the World may become guilty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God. <hi>If men will groundleſly ſay that
all theſe univerſals are to be limited to the
adult, they do but ſay they will believe what
they liſt, and words ſhall ſignifie what they
will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obj. The Text ſpeaks of actors in ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, becauſe it ſpeaks of <hi>all the
World,</hi> among whom the adult (actors)
were the principal part.</p>
            <p>Obj. The word <hi>[All]</hi> is to be taken limited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in many other Texts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. What of that? ſhall we <hi>go.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
its propereſt ſignification, without a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
neceſſity? and ſhall words be taken im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly
by us at our pleaſure, becauſe they
are ſo ſometimes where we may prove it?
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:97269:47"/>
2. Will you allow this plea to them, that uſe
it againſt the texts that ſpeak for [Chriſt's
dying for all]: when yet they have as fair
pretence? 3. The ſcope of the Apoſtle, and
the oft repeated univerſals, plainly ſhew that
it is the guilt and condemnation on one ſide,
and the juſtification on the other ſide, of <hi>all
ſimply,</hi> that are <hi>condemned or juſtified,</hi> even
of <hi>all the World,</hi> that he ſpeaks of. And he
lays the ſtrength of his Argument upon the
univerſality: for if <hi>any</hi> might have pleaded
not-guilty before God, and juſtified by the
Law, or their Innocency, it had ſpoil'd the
Apoſtle's argument. So many plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are not to be forced.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 10.</hi> If infants (without a Redeemer)
ſhould have been all ſhut out of Heaven, and
denied everlaſting happineſs, then are they
guilty of original ſin. But the Antecedent
is true: <hi>go.</hi> ſo is the Conſequent. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
is granted by thoſe that do oppoſe us. If
it were not, it's eaſily proved, 1. From all
thoſe Scriptures that appropriate ſalvation
to the Church, and to the members of
Chriſt, and to ſuch as have it by his purchaſe
and procurement, who hath the keys of the
Kingdom. 2. From thoſe Scriptures that tell
us that if any have not the Spirit of Chriſt,
the ſame is none of his, <hi>Rom. 8. 9.</hi> and that
without holineſs none ſhall ſee God, <hi>Heb. 12.</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:97269:48"/>
14. and that except a man be regenerate, and
new Born, he cannot enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven; with many the like.
3. From the incapacity of an unholy ſoul to
ſee and love God, and ſo to be happy; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a contradiction. And God hath given us
no ground to believe that he will ſanctify all
infants after death: and that without any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
for their ſin by the death of
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The conſequence of the major propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is proved thus: Infants having ſouls
made capable of immortality, either ſhall live
immortally, or not: If not, that privation
of everlaſting life is an evil ſo great, that
any rational man would chooſe a perpetual
tolerable puniſhment to eſcape it: and God
would not thus uſe ſo many ſubjects of his
Kingdom, to whom he hath undertaken to
be a King, and judge them righteouſly, and
all without any meaſure of ſin in them.
And I find not yet that the adverſaries aſſert
this: If they do, they make infants to be
but meer bruits; (of which anon). If they
live an immortal life, (and riſe with others),
then either in Heaven, or out of Heaven, in
happineſs, or not: If not in happineſs,
(which is before proved, and by them gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted),
then it muſt be in miſery: 1. Becauſe
the very privation of that happineſs is half
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:97269:48"/>
hell and more. 2. Becauſe there is no mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
ſtate to a living rational creature: they
will have <hi>feeling</hi> and <hi>knowledge;</hi> and <hi>go.</hi>
they ſhall <hi>feel</hi> good or evil to them: and
they cannot but know that they are depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of Heaven and Happineſs; which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
muſt cauſe a poſitive grief. And thus
God doth afflict them by the greateſt priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſome poſitive pain: which Reaſon,
or Scripture, or his relation of a righteous
King and Judge, will not ſuffer us to think
that he doth without any ſin of theirs. For
ſhall not the Judge of all the World do
righteouſly? Will he deſtroy the righteous
with the wicked? far be it from him, <hi>Gen.
18. 23, 24, 25.</hi> Had all the infants of the
old World, of <hi>Sodom,</hi> of <hi>Amalek,</hi> of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi>
been wholly free from participating in
ſin, they had not been deſtroyed by a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 11.</hi> If infants are under God's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure,
or deprived of his acceptance and
complacency, then are they guilty of original
ſin: but the antecedent is true: <hi>go.</hi> ſo is the
conſequent. If they were in the favour of
God, they would be ſaved; (for all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of his Kingdom have the bleſſings and
rewards of loyal ſubjects, that are in favour
with him): but without Chriſt and pardon
through his blood, they would not be ſaved:
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:97269:49"/>
               <hi>go &amp;c.</hi> If they were not under his diſpleaſure,
he would not deny them his ſanctifying
grace, and heavenly inheritance, which they
are capable of, and which is the portion of
his faithful ones. But theſe he doth deny
to ſome, and would deny to more, or all, if
it were not for their pardon and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
through Chriſt. Nor would he tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
them with pain, (as he doth many in
this life), and after kill them, (and then ſhut
them out of Heaven), if he were well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with them.</p>
            <p>The conſequence is proved, in that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but ſin can make God diſpleaſed with
a rational creature. Only moral evil can
deprive them of his favour. Were original
corruption but <hi>malum phyſicum,</hi> ſuch a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
evil as blindneſs, lameneſs, ſickneſs, mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> God would not withdraw his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
for it. Man hateth a ſerpent or a toad
that have no ſin, becauſe their natures are
contrary to ours: but no meer phyſical evil is
evil to God, or contrary to his nature, and
<hi>go.</hi> none ſuch is hated by him A toad is no
more contrary or odious to God than a lark:
<hi>go.</hi> for ſuch evil, infants could not fall under
his diſpleaſure. He loves the ſick, the lame,
the leprous, as well as the moſt ſound.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 12.</hi> Infants have a nature derived
from their Parents, who were corrupt and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:97269:49"/>
guilty: <hi>go.</hi> they cannot be uncorrupt
and innocent. The antecedent is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable.
The reaſon of the conſequence
is, becauſe the cauſe can produce no effect
that's better than it ſelf. What the effect
receiveth, is from its cauſe: and the cauſe
cannot give that which it hath not: <hi>go. Adam</hi>
could not convey to <hi>Cain</hi> or <hi>Abel</hi> by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
a nature that was innocent and holy,
when he had none but a guilty ſinful nature
himſelf.</p>
            <p>As when <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, each part of
his body did bear its part in the guilt; and if
a leg or an arm had been cut off from him,
that cutting off would not make it become
innocent; but at the reſurrection it ſhall bear
its ſhare of penalty, ſo the embrio, and the
ſeed, blood, and ſpirits that cauſed it, were
as real parts of the Parents once, as a leg or
arm; and when they were parts, they could not
be innocent: (otherwiſe you may as well ſay
that the hand or foot was innocent): and <hi>go.</hi>
they could not meerly by birth become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.
It is not the ſeparation of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
from the mother, that can put away the
guilt that once it had. If any ſay that a leg
or arm themſelves have no ſin or guilt, but all
is in the will; they muſt then make the body
to be no part of the man, and muſt deny its
pain, and its reſurrection to everlaſting pain
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:97269:50"/>
or joy. It's granted that the will is the firſt
and chief ſeat of moral good or evil:
but from thence the whole man doth parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate
thereof: and <hi>go.</hi> it is the man that is
condemned or juſtified, puniſhed or rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and not the will only.</p>
            <p>Obj. But the ſoul was no part of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
though the body were: no nor the body
neither, for it is in a continual flux, and we
have not the ſame body at ſeven years old,
which we received from our Parents.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> This argument (as to the body)
is it by which our novel Infidels do think to
reaſon us out of the belief and hopes of a
reſurrection of theſe ſame numerical bodies:
and by the ſame reaſon you may as effectually
prove, that the body that committeth mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
or adultery this year, and dies ſeven years
after, ſhall not be condemned or puniſhed
for it; becauſe it is not the ſame body that
committed the ſin: but this ingenious folly
will ſave none from puniſhment, nor prove
them guiltleſs of original ſin. So much is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent,
as doth eſſentially conſtitute and
identify the body.</p>
            <p>And for the ſoul, 1. It is certain that it is
eſſential to the man, and certain that man
begets a man; and <hi>go.</hi> certain that man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
the ſoul. And though it be not by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of the Parents ſoul, yet is it a true ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration:
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:97269:50"/>
and <hi>go.</hi> the man begotten can be
no better than he that begat.</p>
            <p>Obj. If you ſay that the ſoul is <hi>ex traduce</hi>
you will make it material, and ſo mortal, and
a compound of two communicated ſouls con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Fathers and the Mothers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If by <hi>materia,</hi> be meant <hi>ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,
quae potentia corpus eſt,</hi> or <hi>ſubſtantia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>completa
in potentia ad omnes formas,</hi> which
is <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s <hi>materia prima;</hi> or if any <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
or any <hi>body</hi> be hereby meant, ſo we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that the ſoul is <hi>material,</hi> or that it is hence
inferred to be ſuch. But if <hi>material</hi> be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
as far as <hi>ſubſtantial,</hi> or ſo far as to
comprehend <hi>ſpirits</hi> (improperly), then it is
granted on both ſides, that the ſoul is <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial.</hi>
But ſuppoſing it taken in the uſual
ſenſe, I anſwer, that God can cauſe ſpiritual
ſubſtances to propagate their kind: and <hi>go.</hi>
ſuch propagation proveth neither their
<hi>materiality</hi> or <hi>mortality;</hi> no more than the
<hi>creation</hi> of the firſt animals proved their <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality:</hi>
nor is it any inconvenience to
grant, that two ſouls do joyn in the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative
generation of a third, as long as it
is not by <hi>partition,</hi> or <hi>deperdition</hi> of any of
their ſubſtance; no more than that two can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
conjoyned ſhould light a third. But
the large handling of this would require
more time and words than we ſhall now
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:97269:51"/>
ſpare. I refer the Reader therefore to thoſe
that have handled this ſubject on purpoſe;
and particularly to <hi>Micraelius</hi> in his <hi>Ethno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phronius.</hi>
It is not a Traduction <hi>e potentia
materiae</hi> that we maintain. The <hi>materiale ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis</hi>
is but as the oyle to the flame, to
which the ſoul is conjunct. The <hi>ſemen</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
<hi>quid immateriale;</hi> the ſoul is in it,
not only in <hi>potentia,</hi> but in <hi>actu,</hi> as it is in
the leg or arm of a man. If you object
that then the ſoul is divided, and part of it
dieth <hi>quum ſemen ejicitur &amp; moritur:</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
Not ſo; no more than it is divided
when a man is beheaded, or dieth when a leg
or arm dieth that is cut off.</p>
            <p>In brief, we muſt not argue <hi>ab ignotiore;</hi>
nor deny a plain and certain truth, (that
man begets man), becauſe we are uncertain
of the manner of the propagation. As
men do in the controverſy about <hi>Grace and
Free-will,</hi> ſo do they in this: they divide what
are to be conjoyned, for fear of giving too
much to the other ſide. As one denieth ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
aſcertaining Grace, and another denieth
Free-will, when that Grace worketh by this
Free-will; ſo ſome deny <hi>God's</hi> part in the
cauſing of the ſoul, and ſome deny <hi>man's</hi>
part, becauſe they are unskilful in diſcerning
the concourſe. God doth as much in it, as
if man did nothing: and is as fully the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:97269:51"/>
cauſe as if it were by a <hi>meer creation,</hi> and
man were no cauſe: and yet he cauſeth it
by man, even in the way of natural procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which by a ſtabliſhed Law he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the beginning; and then gave man
a living ſoul that might propagate living
ſouls. And more than ſo, it is the ſoul that
is the <hi>principal</hi> in procreating and being
procreated: and that ſpark of immortal life
that is in <hi>ſemine,</hi> doth by due cheriſhing of
the further cauſes, fabricate its own body:
and the ſoul (as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaith, <hi>ex Themiſtio),
ſui domicilii non inquilina tantum eſt, ſed &amp;
architecta</hi> (under God). And we are moſt
certain that our knowledge of the way or
manner of God's influx into, and concourſe
with ſecond cauſes, is ſo much above our
reach, that we are unfit from preſumptions
about ſuch a myſtery, to argue againſt a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
truth. Nay, when we have conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured
at the manner, it is our wiſeſt courſe
to confeſs we know it not. But as the wind
bloweth where it liſteth, and we hear the
ſound of it, but know not whence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
or whither it goeth, ſo is it in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goings
of the ſpirit of God for the new
birth, and in like manner of his cauſation of
the natural birth. But of theſe things we
are certain; 1. That the Parents beget the
child: man begets man; by virtue of the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:97269:52"/>
nature, firſt given them, with the law or bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
annexed, <hi>Increaſe and multiply;</hi> and
<hi>God's continued influence.</hi> 2. That man's
ſoul is not <hi>debilitated</hi> in its <hi>vegetative</hi> and
<hi>ſenſitive</hi> operations, by being rational:
3. That <hi>go.</hi> man begetteth not leſs than bruits.
He that ſaith the ſoul, as <hi>vegetative</hi> and <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive,</hi>
is not begotten, makes man to beget
leſs than bruits. 4. Yea he makes him to
beget nothing: for the body or meer matter
is not begotten, but with the ſoul, nor would
the <hi>ſemen inanimatum</hi> come to be an <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brio.</hi>
5. We are ſure that <hi>ſemen in corpore
animatur anima illius cujus eſt corpus.</hi> 6. The
conceit of two or three ſouls, (which is the
laſt refuge), and that the rational only is
created, is at large confuted by many; and
it feigneth man not to procreate his kind,
when bruits do theirs; nor to beget children
indeed, but ſomething elſe that is irrational.
And yet even this way, (ſuppoſing God to
have at the creation by a decree, annexed his
creating act of the rational ſoul, to mans
procreating of the ſenſitive), the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of original ſin might be defended.</p>
            <p>Obj. But by this doctrine ſtill God is made
the cauſe of the ſin: for you ſay he is the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
cauſe of the ſoul, even as much as if man
were no cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> God cauſeth it two waies: 1. At
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:97269:52"/>
the firſt creation of man, he put a virtue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſouls of our firſt Parents to propagate
their like, on ſuppoſition of his requiſite uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
influx, to bring that cauſe or virtue
into act. 2. As an univerſal cauſe he effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
procureth ſecond cauſes to do their
part, and draweth forth their virtue, and
communicateth on his part all that belongeth
to the univerſal cauſe to communicate. Now
if God be the Author of Original ſin, it muſt
be by one of theſe two acts, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Creation,</hi>
or by his <hi>univerſal Cauſation</hi> and influence:
but it is by neither of theſe. Not by <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
giving the generative ſpecifying vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
to man: for he made man upright, and
commanded him to continue ſo, and ſo it was
an upright nature that he ſhould have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated,
if he himſelf had not depraved it
by ſin. Not by his <hi>univerſal concourſe</hi> or
cauſality; for that cauſeth only the <hi>ſoul as
ſuch,</hi> and not as defective or corrupted: as
the Sun cauſeth the life of a toad as well as
of a lion, and of a ſtinking weed as well
as of a flower of the greateſt beauty and
ſweetneſs; but is no cauſe of the ugly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous
nature of the toad, or of the ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nature of the weed, ſave only by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
nor is it any fault in the Sun, that
ſuch creatures are generated by it: ſo though
God is the cauſe of generation by his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:97269:53"/>
influx, yet is he not the cauſe of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſin: for the univerſal cauſe ſuppoſing
the ſpecifying virtue in the ſeed, doth work
on all things according to their natures: and
though God was and is the ſpecifying cauſe
by creating the procreating force in man,
yea and by his conſtant creative emanation,
yet he created not the vice, and <hi>go.</hi> is not
the cauſe of that.</p>
            <p>Obj. But a lame man doth not beget a lame
child; nor a blind man a blind child. Why
then ſhould a ſinner beget a ſinner, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Parents have a corrupted iſſue?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The eye and leg are not the ſoul,
which hath the generative power, nor yet
eſſential parts of the body. But let any of
the eſſentials of the body (as the <hi>brain</hi> or
<hi>heart)</hi> be depraved, and it will appear in the
iſſue, (eſpecially if it be ſo with both the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents):
much more when the ſoul is depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
by whoſe power the body it ſelf is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and which is moſt eſſential to the man,
the pravity muſt needs be communicated.
Lameneſs and blindneſs in the Parents alter
not the procreating ſeed, but conſiſt with
its integrity. But none can communicate
that which he hath loſt, and hath not either
actually or virtually himſelf.</p>
            <p>Obj. Righteouſneſs and holineſs were not
communicable by natural generation if <hi>Adam</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:97269:53"/>
had not fallen: <hi>go.</hi> by generation we have no
privation of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The antecedent is falſe: they
would have been propagated to poſterity as
health and beauty to the body, as I proved in
the beginning. 2. If generation as ſuch
had not conveyed them, yet if God had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed,
by a ſtanding law, his ſupernatural
gifts to natural procreation, it would have
proved (againſt the conſequent) that we are
ſinfully defective in being without them.</p>
            <p>Obj. Learning and wiſdom are not now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
to poſterity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nor any thing that is acquired, and
not natural.</p>
            <p>Obj. Godlineſs is not now conveyed by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
<hi>go.</hi> it ſhould not have been ſo then.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny the conſequence: 1. Becauſe
that holineſs that was natural then, is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
now. You may propagate eye-ſight
to your children becauſe it is natural: but
you can neither reſtore your own, nor theirs,
when it is put out, without a ſupernatural
power. 2. Becauſe though <hi>Adam</hi> was our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
head and root, and ſo had power to
hold or loſe the grace which he had received
for himſelf and us, yet when it came to the
work of our reſtoration, he being utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient
to recover himſelf or us, the work
is put into another hand, and Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:97269:54"/>
the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is now our Root and Head;
and as he purchaſed all, ſo all our mercies
are at his diſpoſal, and he giveth them out
as he ſeeth meet: and <hi>go.</hi> as he gave <hi>Adam</hi>
pardon and holineſs for himſelf, ſo will he
give to all his members for themſelves; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
being ſtill the treaſury of his Church,
and keeping the keys of life in his own
hands. 3. Sanctification is imperfect in
this life, and <hi>go.</hi> leaving ſome corruption,
no wonder if that be propagated by the beſt.
4. But yet as <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have conveyed an
innocent holy nature to his children if he
had not loſt it; even a legal righteouſneſs,
ſuch as he had himſelf: ſo now (though gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
do it not, yet) Chriſt in his Goſpel Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
hath made over a Goſpel Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to the infants of the ſanctified, (who
devote themſelves and their children unto
God in the Baptiſmal Covenant): ſo that as
poſterity is unhappy through their firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
ſin, ſo children may recover happineſs
from Chriſt by means of their Parents faith
and holineſs, and dedicating them to God in
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Obj. Fooliſh Parents beget wiſe children:
<hi>go.</hi> wicked Parents may beget godly chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I grant that God may graciouſly
ſanctifie the ſeed of the ungodly: but that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:97269:54"/>
is not by their procreation. 2. I deny the
conſequence; becauſe that fooliſhneſs comes
from the diſtemper of the organs, and the
bodies ineptitude to ſerve the ſoul, and
no alteration may be made by it upon
the ſeed of generation. But when the ſoul
is depraved by ſin, there is no virtue left in
nature to rectify that by generation, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the propagation of the pravity. 3. And
ſtill as to guilt, all theſe objections ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
No man can convey the innocency
which he had not.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>Adam</hi> when he was pardoned had no
guilt: <hi>go.</hi> he could not convey what he had
not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There is a threefold guilt:
<hi>1. Reatus facti: 2. Reatus culpae: 3. Reatus
ad poenam.</hi> To be guilty of the <hi>fact,</hi> is to be
truly one that did commit it, or participated
therein. To be guilty of the <hi>fault,</hi> is to be
truly <hi>culpable</hi> by reaſon of that fact, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
really a <hi>fault.</hi> Theſe two God taketh
not away by pardon; for it is impoſſible
that which is done ſhould be undone, or that
which was a fault ſhould be no fault. The
third, which is the <hi>obligation to puniſhment,</hi>
is it that is done away by pardon. Now
ſuppoſe this perfectly done away to <hi>Adam,</hi>
or any godly man, yet this pardon is but for
himſelf, and he propagateth to his children
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:97269:55"/>
the two former, <hi>(reatum facti &amp; culpae),</hi>
which were never done away; and then the
third <hi>(obligation to puniſhment)</hi> will follow
immediately <hi>per nudam reſultantiam,</hi> as long
as they have themſelves no pardon.</p>
            <p>2. Chriſt is the Quickening Spirit, though
<hi>Adam</hi> was a Living Soul; and Chriſt is now
the Fountain of Grace, and gives it out in
the meaſure, and on the terms that he ſeeth
meet: And as God paſt ſentence on man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
before he granted his pardon to <hi>Adam,</hi>
and promiſed the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> ſo his pardon
was no full remitting of that ſentence, but
ſuch a perſonal remiſſion to <hi>Adam,</hi> as ſhould
conſiſt with much puniſhment (in his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
in grace, and his toyl, and labour,
and death, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> and with the guilt of his
poſterity, till each man received from Chriſt
the Mediator his own remiſſion. And ſo
as he gave in the promiſe a pardon to <hi>Adam,</hi>
he hath on the ſame condition given it to all.
<hi>Adam</hi> had not power to cure himſelf when
he had poiſoned his nature: but Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
become the common Phyſitian, hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
a remedy for him and us; and if we
take it as <hi>Adam</hi> did, we ſhall be healed: And
the infants are included in the Covenant
with their Parents. So that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all theſe objections, the <hi>12th.</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſtandeth good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:97269:55"/>
               <hi>Arg. 13.</hi> If natural corruption be in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
viciouſly diſpoſing them to evil, and
againſt good, then original ſin is in them.
But ſuch corruption is in them: <hi>go. &amp;c.</hi> The
minor is proved by the common experience
of the World. All infants ſhew their incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to ſin as ſoon as they can act it: yea
ſo ſtrong and obſtinate doth it prove, that
frequently it reſiſteth all the endeavours of
the moſt prudent, diligent, godly Parents
that would root it up; and of Maſters and
Teachers that apply both Doctrine and
Diſcipline againſt it. And never is it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
but by ſpecial grace; and never is it
ſo reſtrained in any that live to the uſe of
reaſon, as not to break out into many actual
ſins. And if all men in all ages in all the
World do ſin, and frequently ſin, it ſhews
that there is ſome corrupt inclination in the
nature of man to ſin; for the effect revealeth
the cauſe: (yea it is ſo great corruption as
to lead into ſome kind of moral neceſſity of
ſinning, or moral impoſſibility of not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
or elſe ſome one in the World would
have eſcaped it: which none did but Chriſt;
and the Papiſts except but the Virgin
<hi>Mary.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, that yet had no corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The fall of one or two may come
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:97269:56"/>
from wilful careleſneſs, or inconſiderateneſs,
where there is no corrupt inclination ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent:
but ſo cannot the fall of all the
World; eſpecially their ſo frequent falls, and
ordinary obſtinacy in ſin. If now and then
a man only ſhould die, we might impute it
to ſome accident; but when all mankind
dieth, we are convinced that mortality (even
a diſpoſedneſs to death in ſome ſort neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitating
it) is become natural to him: ſo
here.</p>
            <p>Obj. Infants have the uſe of ſenſe as ſoon
as they are born, and are long coming to the uſe
of reaſon, and reaſon is long weak when ſenſe
is ſtrong, and this by reaſon of infancy as
ſuch, and <hi>go.</hi> in all this time the prevalency of
ſenſe can be no ſin: and ſo long a prevalency
muſt needs breed a habit: and this is it which
you take for original corruption.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If ſin had not made the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
inordinate, infants might have lived till
they had overgrown their infancy without
tranſgreſſing: an ordinate appetite would
have carried them to no inordinate acts.
And they would not have been ſo liable to
many of thoſe evils that now provoke their
paſſion: and to cry when they are hurt,
would be no ſin. And ſo as they had grown
up, their temptations would have been but
proportionable to their reaſon; and <hi>go.</hi> they
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:97269:56"/>
might well have overcome them. As chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
have not the reaſon of grown men, ſo
neither have they their temptations. They
have not worldly riches, or honours, or dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
to care for; they are not tempted to
the ſins of luſt. And as now the love of
their Parents keepeth them, even in child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
from tranſgreſſing the commands of
their Parents, and maketh them deſirous to
pleaſe them, ſo would the love of God have
made them deſirous to pleaſe him, and keep
his commands. 2. We ſee ſin now break
out in children, before cuſtom can engage
them to ſuch a habit, and againſt that cuſtom
which Parents engage them in againſt it, and
with greater obſtinacy than that meer cuſtom
could ſo ſoon produce. So much for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</p>
            <p>The conſequence of the major is proved,
1. From the purity of God's nature and of his
Law, and from the nature of this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This corruption is a diſconformity to
the holy nature, will and law of God, and
that in his ſubjects: <hi>go.</hi> it is ſin. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
contrary to his holy nature and
image, in a rational creature, muſt needs be
abhorred of God, becauſe they are ſuch. And
the fleſhly mind, the body of death, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Law. 2. Theſe ſame corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which are born with us, remain in the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:97269:57"/>
unſanctified (and partly in others) till they
come to age, and then they are ſin, (even the
ſame degree that was born with us: for it is
not only the degree that cuſtom after ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>addeth
that is ſin). Certainly that abſence of
good, and backwardneſs to it, and proneneſs
to evil, is ſin in the adult: <hi>go.</hi> it was ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
For it was the ſame thing, and in a
true ſubject, capable of vice and virtue.
3. The only Argument againſt it is vain;
<hi>viz.</hi> from the <hi>involuntarineſs,</hi> as ſhall be
ſhewed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 14. Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> had <hi>moral good</hi>
before any <hi>actual volition: go.</hi> infants are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of <hi>moral good</hi> before any <hi>actual voliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
and conſequently <hi>actual volition,</hi> or <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
is not of neceſſity to the <hi>morality</hi> of a
<hi>habit</hi> or <hi>inclination;</hi> and <hi>go.</hi> they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of <hi>moral evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The antecedent is proved by the conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of all, that <hi>Adam</hi> had (whether natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
or ſupernaturally) the image of God,
and virtue or holineſs <hi>ut principium,</hi> before
he acted it: and ſo had original righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
(by creation or gift), which was <hi>bonum
morale,</hi> and made him capable of the divine
complacency and acceptance. The parity
of reaſon proveth the conſequences. Or if
there be any diſparity, it makes againſt the
adverſary; infants being <hi>virtually pre-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent</hi>
in their Parents.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:97269:57"/>
               <hi>Arg. 15.</hi> The doctrine that numbreth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
with bruits, in point of <hi>morality</hi> and
<hi>felicity,</hi> is falſe: but ſuch is that doctrine
which denieth original ſin: <hi>go. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The major is proved, 1. In that they have
immortal ſouls, and virtually rational. 2. They
are under many promiſes and threats that
are mentioned in the Scripture. 3. They are
diſciples of Chriſt, and members of his
Church.</p>
            <p>The minor is plain: 1. In that they make
infants uncapable of any <hi>moral evil eo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
becauſe they have no actual volition,
or choice. 2. And thereby they conclude
them uncapable of <hi>moral good.</hi> 3. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they conclude them uncapable of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
4. And of any rewards. 5. And of
any puniſhments. 6. And they ſay they are
under no law, or obligation. 7. And <hi>go.</hi>
they can be no ſubjects of Chriſt's Kingdom,
or members of his Church. Only, God may
do with them what he will: and ſo he may
with bruits.</p>
            <p>Arg. 16. The infants of the unbelieving
Gentiles were ſinners, and children of wrath:
go. <hi>infants are capable of ſin, and ſome (at

<hi>Joh. 3. 3, 5, 6.</hi> Except a man be born again
he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God:—That
which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh; and
that which is born of the ſpirit, is ſpirit.</p>
            <p>If there be a neceſſity of a new birth to
make us ſpiritual, (the firſt birth bringing
forth but fleſh), before we can enter into
the Kingdom of God, then by the firſt birth
we are born in ſin. But the antecedent is
certain: <hi>go.</hi> ſo is the conſequent.</p>
            <p>The minor is plain in the Text, 1. That
fleſh begets not ſpirit, but fleſh: 2. That re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
is therefore of abſolute neceſſity.
At preſent, I will ſuppoſe that by fleſh here
is not meant ſin, (that the adverſary may
not think I beg any thing of him). The
conſequence of the major hath this double
proof, 1. Becauſe fleſh without ſpirit in a
rational creature is ſinful, or morally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt:
for being deprived of the ſpirit, it is
deprived of <hi>moral good.</hi> 2. Becauſe nothing
but ſin can keep a rational creature, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of God, out of Heaven: for to be kept
out of Heaven, is one half (at leaſt) of the
damned's miſery: and to live and know
that loſs, <hi>(as immortal ſouls</hi> muſt do), will
produce alſo poſitive puniſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:97269:59"/>
               <hi>Arg. 18.</hi> That doctrine is untrue which
<hi>maketh God the Author of ſin;</hi> but ſo doth
the denial of <hi>Original ſin: go.</hi> it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true.</p>
            <p>The major will be granted. The minor I
prove. The doctrine which feigneth that
<hi>innocent nature is under ſuch a moral impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of not ſinning, as that no one perſon in
all the World, that hath the uſe of reaſon, ſhall
eſcape it, doth feign God to be the Author of
ſin.</hi> But ſo doth their doctrine that deny
original ſin: <hi>go.</hi> it feigneth God to be the
Author of ſin. Or, The doctrine which
feigneth that <hi>innocent nature doth ſin</hi> for
want of neceſſary grace to eſcape it, doth
make God the Author of ſin. But ſo doth
the denial of original ſin: <hi>go. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the proof of the major of both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
conſider, 1. That the adverſaries
ſuppoſe nature in infants to be <hi>innocent;</hi>
2. That it is granted by them, that <hi>de facto</hi> all
men that have the uſe of reaſon are ſinners,
except Jeſus Chriſt: (the Papiſts except al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the Virgin <hi>Mary).</hi> If they denied this,
it's eaſily proved, 1. By the common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of the World, (as to the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty).
2. By plain Scripture. <hi>1 Joh. 1. 8. 10.
If we ſay that we have no ſin, we deceive our
ſelves, and the truth is not in us.—If we
ſay that we have not ſinned, we make him a
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:97269:60"/>
liar, and his word is not in us.</hi> Jam. 3. 2. <hi>For
in many things we offend all.</hi> Eccl. 7. 20. <hi>For
there is not a juſt man on earth, that doth
good, and ſinneth not.</hi> And that there is a
<hi>moral impoſſibility</hi> to eſcape ſin, appeareth,
1. By the univerſality of the event: that
which no man in all the World in any age
attaineth to, notwithſtanding all the helps
vouchſafed, is morally impoſſible. 2. And
the Scripture aſſertion proveth it, in that it
alloweth us to conclude it of all that we
know not, and of thoſe that are yet unborn.
And that the World ſinneth for want of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
grace (to innocent nature, as the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
think) is plain: for neceſſary grace
hath ſome ſufficiency to its ends: and <hi>go.</hi> it
it is called <hi>ſufficient grace</hi> by the adverſaries
commonly: But that which never attaineth
its end in any one perſon in the World, in
their own judgment is not ſufficient. It is
their common (and laſt) argument againſt our
doctrine of <hi>ſpecial effectual grace given to all
the elect,</hi> as diſtinct from that <hi>ſufficient grace</hi>
which (ſay the Dominicans) is given to
others; that the grace is not ſufficient that
<hi>never proveth effectual in any.</hi> We may much
more confidently ſay ſo here, when we ſpeak
of the <hi>whole World,</hi> that the grace is not
<hi>ſufficient</hi> that never is, was, or will be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
in any. If it ſuffice to make the event
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:97269:60"/>
               <hi>naturally poſſible,</hi> yet not to remove the <hi>moral
impoſſibility.</hi> 3. And that God is the Author
of the Law that forbiddeth ſin, and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
nature, is granted, and paſt doubt.
The certainty of this univerſal event cannot
come from a contingent cauſe as ſuch.</p>
            <p>The will is <hi>naturally free</hi> that chooſeth,
but it is not <hi>morally free;</hi> or elſe the World
would not chooſe evil. So that it is certain
that if there be no <hi>original ſin,</hi> the cauſe of
this <hi>univerſal event</hi> (that all men ſin) muſt
be reſolved to be ſomewhat in nature, or
ſomething in providence, of which God is
the cauſe. If God have ſo framed <hi>pure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and ſo order the <hi>affairs of the World,</hi>
that no man on earth ſhall eventually eſcape
the ſin, which he ſo much prohibiteth and
abhorreth, it muſt needs follow that he is
the moral reputative cauſe at leaſt. And
yet it is one of the pretences againſt the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of original ſin, that it maketh God the
Author of it in infants, when it's they that
make him the Author of it in all.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore that ſin hath ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread
the World, that all men ſin in all
Countries, in all Ages, (except Chriſt), this
muſt proceed either from mans natural prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and ſo be chargeable upon God his
Maker, or it is the fruit of original ſin, and
to be charged on our firſt Parents, and our
ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:97269:61"/>
               <hi>Arg. 19.</hi> If infants have in their corrupted
natures a <hi>virtual enmity to God and Holineſs,</hi>
then have they original ſin: but ſuch an <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>
they have, (I mean in diſpoſition, ſeed,
or habit): <hi>go.</hi> they have original ſin.</p>
            <p>The antecedent or minor I prove, 1. From
the common experience of the World, that
manifeſt ſuch an enmity as ſoon as they come
to the uſe of reaſon, and that maintain it
ſo obſtinately, till renewing grace do over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
it.</p>
            <p>How early do they ſhew an averſneſs to
the work and ends for which they were
created? How little do the precepts of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
or Teachers, and all the means of
grace themſelves, to conquer it in the moſt?
And where it is moſt conquered, (even in the
godly), it is moſt confeſſed, becauſe there is
a troubleſome remnant of it ſtill: ſo that
there is no man in the World that hath not
more or leſs of it in him; the wicked being
under the power of it, and the godly under
the trouble of theſe remainders.</p>
            <p>2. From <hi>Gen. 3. 15. Joh. 3. 5, 6. Rom. 8.
3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Rom. 7. 21, 23, 24, 25,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.
In <hi>Joh. 3. 6.</hi> we find, that <hi>fleſh begets
but fleſh, [That which is born of the fleſh; is
fleſh],</hi> and that <hi>go.</hi> a new birth by the ſpirit
is neceſſary to make us ſpiritual, (of which
before). In <hi>Rom. 8.</hi> we find, that it was
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:97269:61"/>
               <hi>through the fleſh that the Law was weak,</hi> and
that <hi>God ſending his ſon in the likeneſs of ſinful
fleſh,</hi> (not as <hi>ſinful,</hi> but as <hi>fleſh), and for ſin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
ſin in the fleſh:</hi> Where it is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
that by <hi>[fleſh]</hi> is not meant <hi>ſin it ſelf;</hi>
for then it had not been called <hi>ſinful,</hi> nor
the ſubject <hi>of ſin,</hi> nor Chriſt ſaid to have taken
the <hi>likeneſs of it:</hi> and <hi>go.</hi> the word <hi>[fleſh]</hi>
here is taken in no worſe a ſenſe than in <hi>Joh.
3. 6.</hi> We find here alſo that all fleſh is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
called <hi>ſinful,</hi> which Chriſt took the
<hi>likeneſs</hi> of. And Chriſt took the likeneſs
of <hi>infants,</hi> and that firſt, only growing up
to the likeneſs of the adult: infants <hi>go.</hi> have
<hi>ſinful fleſh.</hi> And <hi>ver. 5, 6.</hi> This fleſh as the
principle that prevaileth in ſome, is oppoſed
to the ſpirit which prevaileth in others, and
their fruits oppoſed: the one ſort mind fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things, the other ſpiritual things; and
death belongs to one, and life and peace to
the other. And <hi>ver. 7. [The carnal mind is
enmity againſt God; for it is not ſubject to the
Law of God, neither indeed can be].</hi> And
<hi>ver. 8. They that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe
God;</hi> that is, they that have not the ſpirit
to ſubdue and mortify the fleſh, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
<hi>ver. 9.</hi> And <hi>[if any man have not
the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his].</hi> So
that <hi>fleſh</hi> without <hi>ſpirit</hi> (which is now mans
natural eſtate) is a principle of <hi>enmity</hi> and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:97269:62"/>
               <hi>rebellion,</hi> and proves men <hi>none of Chriſt's,</hi> and
in a ſtate of death. And many Expoſitors
judge that in <hi>Gen. 3. 15.</hi> ſuch (being none
of Chriſt's till they have the ſpirit) are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerated
to the ſerpents ſeed, that hath the
enmity againſt the ſpiritual ſeed: which ſo
ſheweth it ſelf when they come to age, that
as <hi>Cain</hi> by <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> by <hi>Iſaack,</hi> ſo
ſtill, <hi>[He that is born after the fleſh, perſecuteth
him that is born after the ſpirit],</hi> (if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained),
<hi>Gal. 4. 29.</hi> And <hi>Rom. 7. 18. [I
know that in me, that is, in my fleſh, dwelleth
no good thing],</hi> that is, in <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo far as he
was without the ſpirit.</p>
            <p>And as this innate <hi>univerſal enmity</hi> is thus
proved, ſo it is proved to be <hi>ſin;</hi> 1. By the
Law of nature, which tells us that an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<hi>enmity</hi> of the rational creature againſt
God and Holineſs, is ſin, if any thing be ſin.
It is an inclination or diſpoſition contrary to
the primitive nature and moral image of
God in man, and contrary to what our rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to God importeth; and as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ſaid of actual hatred of God, it may
as truly, if not much more evidently be ſaid
of this <hi>diſpoſitive virtual enmity,</hi> that it is an
<hi>evil</hi> that cannot become good, and ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ſin, that it can be no other. 2. It's
proved to be ſin by the expreſs aſſertion of
the Text. <hi>Rom. 8. 3. 10.</hi> it is <hi>ſinful fleſh,</hi> and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:97269:62"/>
the ſubject of ſin, till the <hi>ſpirit</hi> come. <hi>Ver. 9.</hi>
it proves them none of Chriſt'<hi>s. Rom. 7. 14.
17. 20. 24, 25.</hi> it is called <hi>[in-dwelling ſin],</hi>
and <hi>[a Law of ſin],</hi> and <hi>[to be carnal],</hi> is <hi>[to
be ſold under ſin].</hi> 3. From the effects,
which nothing can produce but ſin. <hi>They
cannot be ſubject to the Law of God: They
pleaſe not God: To be carnally minded is death,</hi>
&amp;c. Rom. 8. So 1 Cor. 2. 14. <hi>The natural</hi>
(meerly animal man now in his corrupt
eſtate) <hi>receiveth not the things of the Spirit of
God, for they are fooliſhneſs to him: nor can
he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually
diſcerned.</hi> And it can be no better than ſin
that maketh ſpiritual things ſeem fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>All the other Texts of Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
urged for Original ſin, I purpoſely
paſs over, becauſe in Commentaries and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
they are ſo frequently hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 20.</hi> My laſt Argument is from the
univerſal conſent of the Church of God, if
not of moſt of the Philoſophers alſo. In ſo
great a point, it is not ſafe to go againſt the
conſent of the univerſal Church, that hath
ſo much in Scripture to encourage and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
it: But the deniers of Original ſin do
go againſt the conſent of the univerſal
Church, as is proved, 1. From the known
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:97269:63"/>
confeſſions of all the Churches that own
Original ſin. 2. In that general Councils

<hi>voluntary</hi> than that which is but ſome ſingle
<hi>Act.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obj. 2. That which never was in our power
to prevent, is not ſin: But, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> go. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was in our power, as we were
in <hi>Adam:</hi> It was in his power, from whom
by the eſtabliſhed Law or order of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
we were to derive our nature.</p>
            <p>That habits are good or evil as well as
acts, I hope few will deny. And whereas it
is objected that only ſuch habits as are the
effects or conſequents of our acts, are ſinful:
I further anſwer: 1. If it be ſo, it is <hi>eo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
becauſe they are the conſequents of
our acts, that they are ſinful, or elſe for ſome
other formal reaſon. Not <hi>becauſe ſuch,</hi> or
as ſuch: for it's moſt certain that many ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of ſin upon our ſelves, are but miſery,
and not properly ſin. Sin may make a man
ſick, or lame, or blind, or mad, and yet theſe
be no ſins, but the effects of ſins. Sin may
kill us, and yet death be no ſin. There muſt
be therefore ſome other formal reaſon, which
can be nothing but the diſconformity to the
rule. 2. <hi>Adam</hi> (as was ſaid before) had
original righteouſneſs, which was imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to him as a moral good, before his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<hi>go.</hi> it is not neceſſary to the morality
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:97269:65"/>
or imputability of a principle, that it be the
conſequent of our acts. 3. Jeſus Chriſt
had moral good before his humane action:
<hi>go.</hi> the ſame will follow. 4. Infants that
are ſanctified have moral good that is not the
conſequent of their acts: <hi>go. &amp;c.</hi> 5. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
by believing Parents, and entring
the child into the Covenant of God, is taken
to all the ends thereof, as if it were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
act. 6. Among men, the will of the
Parents is in many caſes reputatively the
will of the child, and children receive good,
or are deprived of it (and oft-times penally),
for the Parents acts.</p>
            <p>Obj. 3. No righteous Judges do puniſh the
children for the Parents ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is not for the Parents only
imputed, but their own <hi>contracted,</hi> that God
doth puniſh them. And he takes that cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
of the heart that man doth not. 2. And
he is more holy and juſt than man. 3. And
yet all Common-wealths are directed by the
light of nature, to puniſh infants for their
Parents ſins, as naturally participant. The
Laws do threaten the poſterity of many of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,
for the Parents ſins; and Judges
ſentence them accordingly. As that Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
or ſome other moſt odious offenders,
ſhall be deprived of their honours and
eſtates, and their children after them for
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:97269:66"/>
ever. It cannot be ſaid here that this is but
an affliction to the poſterity, and not a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty;
or that it is a meer conſequent of the
Parents ſin, and not the effect: for it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in the Law, and Judgment; and is
<hi>malum naturale propter malum civile vel mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rale;</hi>
and it's on a <hi>ſubject:</hi> And it's a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the good that he ſhould elſe have
poſſeſſed; and many poſitive evils of mind
and body (care, ſorrow, want, labour, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi>
follow thereupon.</p>
            <p>Obj. 4. But God hath told us, that the ſoul
that ſinneth ſhall die; and the child ſhall not
die for the Parents ſins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. <hi>go.</hi> it followeth that children
that do die, have ſin of their own. 2. The
text plainly ſpeaketh of thoſe children, that
ſee the evil of their Parents ſins, and do not
after them, but renounce them, and live in
righteouſneſs themſelves: which is nothing
to the preſent caſe.</p>
            <p>Obj. 5. It ſeems to make God the Author of
ſin, when he will cauſe us to be born of ſinful
Parents, and infuſe a ſoul into ſinful fleſh,
when we cannot help it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I have proved that it is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
of original ſin, that makes God the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of ſin, reſolving it into his workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
or denial of ſufficient or neceſſary
grace, ſo that no man in the World avoideth
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:97269:66"/>
ſin. 2. But the true doctrine of original ſin,
doth manifeſt that it is not of God, as I have
ſhewed. God as Creator ſetled the nature
of his creatures, and the courſe of propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them, before man ſinn'd: and he was
no ways bound to change the courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
when man had corrupted it, to prevent
our being born ſinners. Though we know
not fully the manner of God's concourſe in
our generation, and how he cauſeth ſouls;
yet we are ſure it is according to the firſt
eſtabliſhed courſe of nature, appointed in the
creation, as much as the generation of any
other creature is: and that's enough.</p>
            <p>God was not the cauſe of <hi>Adam</hi>'s tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion;
and his Law of propagation went
before it: and his concourſe with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
maketh him no more the cauſe, than
the Sun is of the poiſon of a toad.</p>
            <p>Obj. 6. But it ſeemeth cruelty to damn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
for that which they could not help.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The deniers of Original ſin do
much more impute cruelty to God, as I ſhall
prove. For, 1. They confeſs as much of the
miſery and ſufferings of infants, as we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert.
2. And they maintain that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
all this without the leaſt deſert of
theirs. For the firſt, they confeſs that infants
die: and they confeſs that God is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to revive them; and that without
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:97269:67"/>
Chriſt they ſhould have no part in glory.
If God may annihilate them, or deny them
an immortal life, they cannot deny but he
may cauſe their ſouls to live, and their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to revive, if he pleaſe: and if ſo, that
he may inflict as much poſitive pain as ſhall
be proportioned to the evil of annihilation.
And it is a great deal of ſuffering that man
would chooſe to prevent annihilation. They
confeſs that God may make them to be
toads, (when ſuch creatures are what they
are without ſin): and ſo continue them for
ever. And who would not endure much
miſery as a man, rather than be a toad or
ſerpent? They confeſs that infants have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
ſouls, (at leaſt capable of immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty),
and that God is no ways bound to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate
them, and that he may ſhut them
out of happineſs; which is half damnation,
and that in equality with the worſt, (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſame Heaven that all men loſe):
and if they are rational creatures, they muſt
needs have the torment of poſitive grief in
the deſpairing apprehenſion of their loſs.
And for our parts, we preſume not to be ſo
far acquainted with the ſecret judgments of
the Lord, as to determine whether infants
ſhall have a greater degree of miſery in their
damnation, than all this which the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
grant. So that we differ not about
the degree of ſuffering.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:97269:67"/>
2. And then for the cauſe of it, there's
the difference. We ſay that God inflicteth
not all this but for <hi>their own deſert by original
ſin:</hi> And our Adverſaries ſay, that he doth
it without the <hi>leaſt fault or deſert</hi> of theirs.
And then I would know whether there be
any reaſon why God doth all this againſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
but becauſe <hi>he will do it?</hi> If man had
never ſinned, he might have done it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to them. If it be ſaid, that he puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Parents in the children: I anſwer,
1. What puniſhment to Parents is the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
loſs or ſuffering of the children?
2. Or what puniſhment is the preſent death
of children, to harlots and unnatural per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
that deſire to be rid of them? 3. And
how can he cauſe the ſubjects of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to ſuffer ſo much without their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert?
4. And if their natural intereſt make
them not in ſome meaſure partakers of their
Parents ſin, what reaſon, why they any more
than other creatures, ſhould be choſen to the
ſuffering?</p>
            <p>And here I would propound this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion:
What if God had left it in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to <hi>Adam</hi>'s free will, whether he
would beget a man, or a toad, or a ſerpent?
Would you have thought this a cruelty, or
injuſtice? Why might not God leave ſuch a
thing to his free will, as well as his own
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:97269:68"/>
ſalvation or damnation? And if he might
leave it to a ſerpent neceſſarily to beget a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
why might he not leave it to the <hi>will</hi>
of man to do it freely? And if man had
choſen ſuch a generation, could his off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring
(if capable) have charged God with
cruelty? And if not, (as nothing ſurer) why
might not God leave it to the will of man
to remain righteous, and beget a righteous
ſeed; or to fall, and beget ſuch as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</p>
            <p>Obj. 7. But the pains of hell conſiſt in the
torments of conſcience: and the conſcience of
an infant will not torment him for that which
he could not help.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is paſt our reach here to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
fully the nature of hell torments.
2. The loſs of Heaven is the greateſt part of
the miſery. 3. The ſenſe of that loſs will be
no ſmall poſitive miſery. 4. And all this
(which the adverſaries grant) will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
due for original pravity, and becauſe
they are the ſeed of ſinners.</p>
            <p>Obj. 8. No Law forbiddeth us to be the ſeed
of <hi>Adam,</hi> or to draw corruption from our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Law forbad <hi>Adam,</hi> in whom
we were, to ſin; and it requireth perfection
of acts and habits, and condemneth ſinful
habits as well as ſinful acts: and <hi>go.</hi> we are
violaters of that Law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:97269:68"/>
Obj. 9. If Original ſin were derived from
<hi>Adam</hi> to us, it would have been in the humane
nature of Chriſt; at leaſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s act would
have been imputed to him, as being really the
ſon of man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The relation and corruption go
together; and both of them belong to them
that derived their natures only from <hi>Adam,</hi>
according to the way of natural generation.
But Chriſt was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt,
who by ſanctifying the ſubſtance of the
Virgin, of which he had his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and by the miraculous way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,
prevented the derivation of guilt
or ſin.</p>
            <p>Obj. 10. <hi>Chriſt ſaith,</hi> except we become as
little children we ſhall not enter into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He ſpeaks not of their innocency,
but of their beginning the World, and their
lowlineſs: except we be little in our eyes,
and begin the World a-new by converſion,
we cannot enter into his Kingdom. But
this denieth not, but that infants may have
corruption that unfits them for his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
as you confeſs.</p>
            <p>Obj. 11. 1 Cor. 7. 14. The children of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
are holy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But not by nature, but by grace,
and the faithful's intereſt in the covenant
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:97269:69"/>
and dedication of them to Chriſt in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.
2. They had no need of this hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if they had not naturally ſome corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And, 3. The children of unbelievers
are ſtill unclean. 4. And the children of
the faithful are not perfectly holy: for then
they ſhould be better than the Parents.</p>
            <p>Obj. 12. By the ſame reaſon you may ſay
that we are guilty of our immediate Parents
ſins: for we were in them more immediately
than in <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We have the ſame natural intereſt
in our neareſt Parents ſin, and ſome partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation;
which we muſt lament, and not
excuſe. But of that I have ſpoken by it
ſelf.</p>
            <p>The chief objections here omitted, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
before, (from <hi>Adam</hi>'s, or our nearer
Parents being themſelves forgiven, and ſo
having no guilt to derive to us; and their
being ſanctified; and from the creation of
the ſoul, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> and <hi>go.</hi> ſhall not again repeat
the anſwers to them. It better beſeems us
to confeſs our ſin and miſery, and value the
remedy, than to tell Chriſt that we will not
ſo much as pray for the pardon of Original
ſin, nor be beholden to him to forgive it,
nor to his ſpirit to cure it: which yet is
really the thoughts of them that think they
have no ſuch thing.</p>

            <head>Whether Posterity be guilty

            <p>AS little as is ſaid by Divines on this
Queſtion, it is no over-curious, or
needleſs unprofitable ſubject; but
very weighty, and needful to be underſtood
by all Chriſtians, that can reach to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of it. For as it is uſeful for the
opening of the cauſe and nature of Original
guilt, ſo, if it ſhould prove true that we are
guilty by the ſins of our immediate Parents,
it would be neceſſary that we know it, for
our due humiliation, and that we may in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
confeſſions and deprecations prevail
with God for the pardon thereof: As it is
thought a dangerous thing to deny original
ſin, becauſe they that ſo do, will not be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
under it, and ſenſible of their miſery
by it, nor of the neceſſity of God's mercy,
or Chriſt's blood for the pardon of it, nor
will apply themſelves to God by Chriſt in

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:97269:70"/>

of pardon: ſo in the preſent caſe, the ſame
reaſons will prove it as well dangerous to
deny our guilt of our Parents ſins, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
we are ſo guilty. Which that we may
enquire into, after a very brief explication
of the terms of the Queſtion, I ſhall lay
down a few neceſſary diſtinctions, and then
aſſert what I judge to be the truth in certain
Propoſitions, and prove ſuch of them as
moſt require proof.</p>
            <p>1. By [immediate Parents], we mean
thoſe that perſonally beget: By [Poſterity],
we mean their children ſo begotten. By
Reaſon of [Actual ſin], we mean, by the
Merit of thoſe ſins which our Parents them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
committed; or by a reſultancy from
ſuch ſin compared with the rule. By <hi>guilt,</hi>
we mean obligation to puniſhment, or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of puniſhment. By <hi>death,</hi> we mean the
deſtruction, or final miſery of the creature;
either death temporal, or eternal.</p>
            <p>We muſt here diſtinguiſh, 1. Between the
ſeminal, cauſal, potential, and virtual being
which we have in our Parents, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
exiſtence that we have in our ſelves.
2. Between the guilt which immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulteth
from actual ſin, and the guilt which
riſeth but mediately from it, <hi>viz.</hi> by the
means of ſome intervening corruption of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:97269:71"/>
our own. 3. Between the ſins of Parents
while we are ſeminally in them, and their
ſins after our birth: either, 1. in our infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
or 2. in our riper age. 4. Between guilt
of fault, and guilt of puniſhment. 5. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the aggravation of voluntarineſs actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
and of voluntarineſs habitual, or diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive.
6. Between plenary proper guilt,
and guilt ſo called by analogy of attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and guilt ſo called equivocally. 7. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
puniſhment univocally, analogically,
or equivocally ſo called. 8. Between obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to the pain of loſs, and to the pain
of ſenſe. 9. And between the meer ſenſe
of that loſs, and the ſenſible accuſations of
conſcience for actual ſin. 10. Between the
curable obligation of the Law of Nature, or
Works, and the peremptory and remedileſs
obligation of the Law of Grace.</p>
            <p>Though theſe diſtinctions reach further
than to the terms of the Queſtion, yet are
they all ſuch as will be of neceſſary uſe in
our determination.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. 1.</hi> God doth not impute to us the
ſins either of our firſt or neereſt Parents,
further than our true intereſt in ſuch ſins
doth give ſufficient ground for ſuch impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>As Dr. <hi>Twiſs,</hi> among others, hath oft and
well proved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:97269:71"/>
               <hi>Prop. 2.</hi> God doth not eſteem us to have
<hi>perſonally committed</hi> the ſins which our <hi>firſt</hi>
or <hi>neereſt</hi> progenitors did actually commit.
For his judgment is true; and therefore he
judgeth of things as they are; and therefore
he judgeth us not to have done that <hi>perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,</hi>
which we did not do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. 3.</hi> God doth not by any Law ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
us to puniſhment, as the <hi>perſonal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitters</hi>
of ſuch ſins, which any progenitors
of ours did commit, and not we: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are not guilty of puniſhment on
that account. He never made ſuch a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with <hi>Adam,</hi> or any ſince, as ſome ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
wherein he declareth that he will judge
the Poſterity guilty of the Parents ſin further
than their true deſert or intereſt in it, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
becauſe God <hi>will ſo judge,</hi> or becauſe he
<hi>will</hi> impute the ſins of one to another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his deſert: that were to make <hi>him</hi> the
cauſer of ſuch mens ſins, or rather to <hi>miſtake,</hi>
and <hi>call</hi> that <hi>their ſin</hi> which indeed is <hi>not
ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. 4.</hi> It ſeems to me that in the <hi>ſame

we are alſo guilty of the ſins of our <hi>neereſt
Parents;</hi> allowing for ſome accidental dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
and alſo our guilt having a <hi>remedy</hi>
at hand, which his had not that he knew of,
we being under a pardoning covenant. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:97269:72"/>
this propoſition is not agreeable to the
commoneſt opinion, I ſhall ſpeak to the proof
of it, and of ſome that are near to it, anon
towards the end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. 5.</hi> If it ſhould prove true, which
ſome of the Reformed Divines maintain,
that original ſin doth conſiſt only in the <hi>real
qualitative corruption</hi> of our nature, and
not directly in any <hi>imputation of</hi> Adam'<hi>s
actual ſin</hi> to us; and that there is no ſuch
direct imputation of his ſin to us, but that it
is only the <hi>cauſe</hi> of our proper Original ſin,
and not our <hi>ſin formally:</hi> then muſt it needs
follow that the like muſt be ſaid for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
of the ſins of our immediate Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents:
for they can be no more our ſins,
than <hi>Adam</hi>'s was. If this opinion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſtand good, then our controverſy is at an
end; and we are not guilty either of <hi>Adam</hi>'s
ſin, or of our next Parents, nor of death
for them. I will not preſume to make my
ſelf judge between the Learned Divines that
diſagree upon this point: <hi>Camero</hi> and his
followers go this way, againſt the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin to us: of which ſee the
ſum of their Arguments in <hi>Joſ. Placaeus</hi>
his <hi>Diſputat. de ſtatu hominis lapſi ante Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam

the Popiſh errors, as you may ſee in <hi>Tom. 3.

So alſo <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> on <hi>Rom. 5.</hi>
But yet the far greater number of our Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
go the other way, and ſo do the Papiſts
too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. 6.</hi> It ſeems not to be a guilt ſo ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
and perfect, which we lie under for
any Parents ſin, (if ſuch a thing be proved),
as that is which a man is under for his own
perſonal ſin. The difference will appear, if
we conſider that it is not a puniſhment in
ſo full and perfect a ſenſe, which we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to: for the ſuffering is but the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the puniſhment; its form lieth in the
relation of that ſuffering to the fault: if the
<hi>malum naturale</hi> be not <hi>propter malum mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rale,</hi>
it is not puniſhment: and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is his in the fulleſt ſenſe, who ſuffereth
for his own ſin: now the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> or
any Parent, is not ſo fully our own as that is
which we perſonally commit; ſeeing as we
were but ſeminally, cauſally, and potentially
in our Parents, and not by exiſtence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally;
ſo it is not ſo much to be eſteemed
the ſon of a ſinner, as to be eſteemed the
actual ſinner himſelf. So that it ſeems our
guilt of, and puniſhment for the actual ſin of
any Parent, is ſo called by analogy of attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:97269:73"/>
as they ſpeak, (as <hi>Accidens</hi> is called
<hi>Ens),</hi> being a more imperfect kind of guilt
and puniſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. 7.</hi> It is paſt doubt that God may
and doth puniſh Parents in their children:
In which caſe the ſufferings of the children
are materially (though not as the next mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
the puniſhment of the Parent; but the
next matter is the Parents own ſuffering
(real or reputative) in the ſuffering of his
children: but this God doth not without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to ſome concurrent guilt in the child,
unleſs as he will repair his hurt with a greater
good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. 8.</hi> When the ſufferings of a child
are but the meer conſequents of the Parents
ſin or puniſhment, then are they no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
themſelves, unleſs equivocally ſo
called: but when they are intended by the
Rector for the demonſtration of juſtice for
the Parents fault, then it hath the nature of
puniſhment, though the child were imagined
innocent. For example; If a Traytor be
ſentenced to death, and his eſtate forfeited
to the Prince, his Heirs will be deprived of
all their hopes, though the Judge never
thought of them in his ſentence, becauſe
the Parent cannot convey to his poſterity
what he hath loſt himſelf. And here the
ſuffering of the Heirs is not formally a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:97269:73"/>
but the meer conſequent of a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.
But if the Rector do ordain that
the Heirs of a Traytor ſhall be deſinherited,
and intend this as part of the penalty, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
others from Treaſon, then it is not a meer
conſequent, but a real puniſhment, though
the Heir be perſonally innocent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. 9.</hi> It ſeems to me that we are ſo far
guilty both of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, and of our
neerer Parents, committed whilſt we were
ſeminally in them, as that God may, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without injuſtice, but alſo in poſitive exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of vindictive juſtice, puniſh us with
temporal death for ſuch guilt, though it be
but a more imperfect kind of guilt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. 10.</hi> If this intereſt in our Parents
ſins deſerve a temporal death, then alſo an
everlaſting death. For when the creature
hath loſt his life by the ſtroke of juſtice, God
is not bound to reſtore it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. 11.</hi> It hence followeth that God
may in juſtice deprive us of everlaſting
glory for ſuch guilt; which is one part of
Hell, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>poena damni:</hi> for the dead en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
not glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. 12.</hi> Hence alſo it followeth that
God may juſtly, for ſuch guilt, leave man
under ſome penalty of ſenſe too, as well as
of loſs: 1. Becauſe he may, if he pleaſe,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:97269:74"/>
continue natural life to man, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priveth
him of glory; (for he that may
juſtly take away both, may take away one
only): and then man being rational, muſt
needs have a ſenſe of the greatneſs of his
loſs. 2. And there is no man of reaſon, but
would rather chooſe a tolerable degree of
pain for ever, (as a leſs evil) than to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated.
And he that may inflict the
greater, may inflict the leſſer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. 13.</hi> Thoſe poſitive torments of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
which follow the review of wilful
actual ſin, and which men muſt ſuffer for
ſuch in Hell, cannot be the puniſhment of
our guilt either of <hi>Adam</hi>'s or our neereſt
Parents actual ſin. Becauſe conſcience hath
no ſuch matter to work upon; it cannot
charge us with chooſing that evil by our own
wills; for ſo far this guilt was involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. 14.</hi> God is the Rector of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
of Common-wealths, Churches, and
Families, as well as of individual perſons;
and therefore he may puniſh the World as
ſuch, and puniſh a Common-wealth as ſuch
for their ſins, or a ſinful Church, or a ſinful
Family: And ſo ſome individual perſons,
not as ſuch, but as parts of the ſociety, may
juſtly ſuffer the loſs of thoſe benefits, which
as members of that ſociety they did poſſeſs,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:97269:74"/>
though they committed not the ſins for which
the puniſhment is inflicted: In which caſe the
nature of puniſhment is divided between
the ſociety, and that individual ſufferer. It
is the <hi>Societies fundamentaliter,</hi> becauſe <hi>they</hi>
are the ſinners; it is the <hi>ſufferers Termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
becauſe he beareth it: and true puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it is; for it is [ſuffering for ſin], though
not for his <hi>perſonal</hi> ſin. And thus a <hi>Child,</hi> a
<hi>Subject,</hi> a <hi>Church-member</hi> may ſuffer for the
ſins of the Heads or Body of the Society.
Nor can it well be ſaid that this is but on
<hi>occaſion</hi> of their ſin, and not <hi>for it,</hi> and ſo
that it is but equivocally puniſhment, and
not truly ſo: for it is an evil of ſuffering
for the evil of ſin, and inflicted for demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of juſtice on the whole, and ſo on
each part. Yea, and it ſeems that poſitive
puniſhments, as well as loſſes, may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on this account.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. 15.</hi> Yet as God is Rector of each
particular perſon as well as of ſocieties, ſo
he dealeth juſtly with every perſon, and
therefore in puniſhing ſocieties, he ſtill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth
his eſtabliſhed Laws concerning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals:
and therefore he puniſheth no
perſon beyond his due: For, 1. it is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
that a man who by conſent is a member
of any Society, doth conſent to bear or ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
on the common inconveniencies and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicity
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:97269:75"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               </gap>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:97269:76"/>
of that Society, ſo that he may be
partaker of the felicity and benefits of it:
and where nature makes a man a member of
a ſociety, it ſupplies the place of our perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
conſent. For in it ſelf it is a neceſſary
good to us to be in ſociety with others, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no man can live happily by himſelf; and
it is ſuppoſed in nature, that no man will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
from his own neceſſary good. It is
therefore by their own conſent fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally,
that ſuch perſons, though innocent in
themſelves, are made liable to puniſhment;
and therefore in all wars, when the innocent
do ſuffer with the guilty, in the beſieging of
a City, the puniſhing of a Country, it is no
injuſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But that is becauſe men are not able
to diſcern between the righteous and the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or to difference in the execution, as God
can do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's true that God can do this, and
man cannot: but withal God doth not
all that he can do. He ruleth the World by
means in an eſtabliſhed order, and it is he
that hath given men authority to rule under
him: and therefore whatſoever puniſhment
they righteouſly execute, it is God that
righteouſly doth it by them. So that as men
do us no wrong in ſuch caſes, ſo neither doth
God. 3. But yet God hath determined in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:97269:76"/>
his Laws, that none ſhall bear the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>eternal damnation,</hi> for the ſins of a
<hi>ſociety,</hi> but for his <hi>own ſin:</hi> yea, he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
that all ſhall tend to the everlaſting
felicity of the innocent. 4. It cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
any wrong to ſuch, when God will
repair their hurt or loſs with far greater
advantages, which he might have denied
them. 5. But yet for all this, it is certain
that <hi>de facto</hi> God doth not puniſh any man
who is <hi>not guilty</hi> by <hi>perſonal ſins;</hi> for there
is none ſuch on earth to puniſh: but though
God doth ſo ſweetly, and in perfect order car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on the work of Government, that none
ſhall have cauſe to complain of injuſtice,
and doth keep an harmonious conſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his more general and his particular
puniſhing juſtice, ſo puniſhing ſocieties, that
he will make good all his promiſes to each
individual: yet, 1. It ſeems to me that in
one and the ſame penalty materially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
God may puniſh us both as <hi>indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
perſons</hi> for our <hi>own ſin,</hi> and as <hi>members</hi>
of a <hi>Society</hi> for the <hi>ſins</hi> of the Society,
which are no otherwiſe ours, than by being
<hi>ſuch members</hi> of a ſinful body, and ſo being
liable to the juſtice which that Body is liable
to. 2. And it ſeems to me, that if we
<hi>were ſuppoſed</hi> to be <hi>perſonally innocent,</hi> yet
God might in juſtice puniſh us with ſuch a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:97269:77"/>
ſociety, ſo far as may ſtand with his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to individuals: and that that Covenant
doth not reſtrain him from inflicting the
leaſt penalty on us for any beſides our own
ſins which we have perſonally committed:
Though ſtill even the guilt of that <hi>common
ſin,</hi> is <hi>participative perſonally ours,</hi> as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
in it by being <hi>members</hi> of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety:
as the hand is guilty of the ſin of the
tongue, becauſe it is a member of the body
that is guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> There is no ſin, and ſo no puniſhment,
where there is no willingneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here is a <hi>willingneſs fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally,</hi>
in that in hope of the <hi>good</hi> of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
and benefit from it, we conſent to ſhare
with them, and ſpeed as they, though we
conſent not to the ſin: ſo that the ſin is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putatively</hi>
ours, <hi>ſo far</hi> as that we ſhould be
obliged to puniſhment by it, though not in
it ſelf, nor ſo as that we ſhould be accounted
the <hi>actual offenders.</hi> Even as <hi>our ſins</hi> became
Chriſt's by his <hi>voluntary ſponſion,</hi> ſo far as to
<hi>bear the penalty,</hi> but not ſo far as to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the <hi>committer of them:</hi> ſo that his
ſufferings were truly puniſhments, becauſe
for ſin, though not for his own; yet not
puniſhments in ſo full and ſtrict a ſenſe as
ours that ſuffer for our own ſins; but by
analogy of attribution, or <hi>ob inaequalem ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:97269:77"/>
attributionem:</hi> and ſuch, as it ſeems to
me, are thoſe puniſhments which innocent
perſons ſuffer meerly for the ſins of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
that they are members of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. 16.</hi> It is not a meer <hi>reputative in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi>
(as the laſt deſcribed), but a <hi>natural
intereſt</hi> which we have in the guilt of
<hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>actual ſin,</hi> and ſo in the guilt of the
<hi>actual</hi> ſins of our neerer Parents, as to meer
deſert: For our <hi>nature</hi> was in him: our
perſons, though not exiſtent, were <hi>ſeminally</hi>
in him; we come not from <hi>Adam</hi> as our
Creator, that makes us of nothing, nor as
our Fabricator, that makes us of an extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
pre-exiſtent matter; but as our <hi>Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor,</hi>
who deriveth a being to us by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
out of himſelf; and therefore can
give us <hi>no better</hi> than he <hi>had himſelf,</hi> either
<hi>qualitatively</hi> or <hi>relatively;</hi> and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>ſon of death,</hi> he could not beget <hi>ſons of
life:</hi> being <hi>guilty,</hi> he could not beget per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that are innocent; nor bring a clean
thing from himſelf, who was unclean.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. 17.</hi> This natural intereſt in the
guilt of Progenitors, is only from thoſe ſins
which they committed while we were in
their loins, or ſeminally in them, and not
from any that they committed after we were
born: but the reputative guilt which we
have from the ſins of ſocieties (whereof we
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:97269:78"/>
are naturally or electively members) may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
us as much (and rather) from the ſins
which they commit when we are at age, and
have the fulleſt uſe of reaſon; therefore all
men ſhould be careful what ſociety they vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
joyn themſelves to, or abide in, and
ſhould diligently endeavour the reformation
of ſuch ſocieties: and when they are falling
into ruine paſt hope of recovery, ſhould fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee
the fall, and ſave themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. 18.</hi> It is both theſe ſorts of guilt
which adhere to us in our <hi>infancy</hi> from our
<hi>Parents</hi> ſins. 1. The guilt which followeth
our <hi>natural intereſt,</hi> as we are <hi>ſeminally</hi> in
them, adhereth to us all, as ſoon as we have
our being. 2. The other is varied according
to the ſeveral <hi>ſocieties</hi> that we are members
of. 1. As we are members of the great
Common-wealth of the World, whereof
God is the Soveraign, ſo we are guilty by
reaſon of the ſin which mankind in our firſt
Parents committed in the beginning. For
God dealt with <hi>Adam</hi> in his firſt Laws, not
only as an individual perſon, but alſo as
<hi>whole mankind,</hi> he and his wife being then
the <hi>whole World.</hi> And ſo as we are firſt
guilty of death, becauſe of our <hi>natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi>
in <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, as being his <hi>Progeny,</hi> ſo
next we are alſo guilty by reaſon of this
<hi>civil</hi> or <hi>reputative intereſt,</hi> as being members
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:97269:78"/>
of the ſinful <hi>World,</hi> or of ſinful <hi>mankind:</hi>
which later yet ſuppoſeth the <hi>former</hi> as its
ground, and doth not ariſe from any <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
or <hi>Will</hi> of God to impute that to us
which we were never guilty of, by any <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
intereſt</hi> of our own. Not that we
<hi>were perſonally guilty</hi> before we were <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally
exiſtent;</hi> but that we were then <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally
guilty</hi> as we had a <hi>ſeminal being</hi> in
the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>perſon</hi> of our <hi>Progenitors;</hi>
and when our <hi>perſons</hi> from that <hi>ſeed</hi> do <hi>firſt
exiſt,</hi> they are <hi>guilty perſons,</hi> as ſoon as <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi>
And therefore when man had firſt
ſinned, God, that had given him a Law, as
being all mankind, and the root of a Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in courſe of nature to ſpring from him,
did alſo in the ſame relation call him to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſentence him for his ſin; and
therefore paſſed ſuch a ſentence which we
ſee by experience is executed on all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
and as the individuals multiply from
the firſt condemned root, ſo doth the guilt
and the ſentenced puniſhment adhere to
each individual. (And in the ſame relation
was the promiſe of a Redeemer made to
him.) As it was not <hi>Adam</hi> only, but all
mankind that is meant by God's ſentence,
<hi>[Duſt thou art, and to duſt thou ſhalt return,</hi>
&amp;c.] yet <hi>only Adam</hi> as then <hi>perſonally exiſtent</hi>
and <hi>condemned,</hi> and all others as <hi>ſeminally</hi>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:97269:79"/>
in him, and the ſentence makes its <hi>firſt</hi> ſeizure
on their <hi>perſons</hi> when their <hi>perſons</hi> ſhall <hi>firſt
exiſt,</hi> and not before; Even ſo is it by the
<hi>guilt,</hi> as it is by the <hi>ſentence:</hi> It was only
<hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>perſon</hi> that was at <hi>firſt guilty;</hi> but
not only as a <hi>particular private perſon,</hi> but as
<hi>mankind,</hi> and as the <hi>root</hi> of all that ſhould
ſucceed; and therefore <hi>we were ſeminally
guilty</hi> in him, and <hi>are perſonally guilty from
him,</hi> when we firſt <hi>perſonally exiſt.</hi> 2. And
as we are thus guilty as <hi>members</hi> of <hi>ſinful
mankind,</hi> ſo alſo as members of <hi>ſinful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies;</hi>
and in that reſpect may for the ſins
of our <hi>neereſt Parents,</hi> lie under <hi>Family pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.</hi>
3. So are we alſo as members of
<hi>wicked Common-wealths,</hi> and particular
ſubordinate Societies in thoſe Common-wealths:
And therefore it is ſo common for
God to puniſh men for <hi>common abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
and provoking enormities, which yet
themſelves did not commit.</p>
            <p>4. The like may be ſaid of heretical, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure,
and ſcandalous Churches, whoſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
become liable to Church-puniſhments,
as thoſe aforeſaid to Common-wealth-pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. 19.</hi> It is one thing to be ſo <hi>far guilty,</hi>
or to <hi>deſerve puniſhment,</hi> as that God <hi>may</hi> in
the execution of vindictive juſtice, lay it
on us as our due, (unleſs remedied): and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:97269:79"/>
it's another thing to be ſo far guilty, as that
God <hi>muſt</hi> puniſh us, or elſe be unjuſt, or not
attain the ends of right Government, by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
means. It is the firſt guilt only which
I ſay ariſeth from the ſins of our Parents to
us: the ſecond I neither affirm nor deny, as
not intending now to meddle with that
Controverſy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. 20.</hi> Though according to the ſtrict
rigor of the Law of nature or works, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
alone, God might, for the ſin of
<hi>Adam,</hi> or our neerer Parents, adjudge us to
everlaſting death, as our due, becauſe of our
forementioned participation therein: yet
hath he provided ſuch a remedy in the
Goſpel, that no man ſhall everlaſtingly
periſh for any ſuch ſin, who is made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of that remedy. And therefore though
the Goſpel findeth men under ſuch a guilt by
nature, yet doth it not bind it on them, but
free them from it, if they be in Chriſt: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when God telleth men that if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and believe, it is not their Fathers ſins
that ſhall damn them, yet bids them take
heed leſt they periſh by their own, this doth
not deny that we deſerve death for <hi>Adam</hi>'s,
or our other Parents ſins; but only that if
we repent, and be our ſelves evangelically
righteous, the deſerved evil ſhall not befall
us. The remedy ſuppoſeth, and not denieth
the malady.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:97269:80"/>
               <hi>Prop. 21.</hi> A further difference may yet
appear between the guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt ſin,
and our guilt of his following ſins, or the
ſins of our neerer Parents; if we diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
between the <hi>Fundamentum</hi> and the
<hi>Terminus</hi> of guilt, and then obſerve, that
the <hi>Terminus</hi> is but one and the ſame, but
the Foundation is divers. The puniſhment
which we are guilty of, or liable to, by
<hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, is the privation of our whole
felicity. The new guilt of our neerer Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
ſin, or <hi>Adam</hi>'s further ſins, yea, or our
own actual ſin, can bring no new puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on us according to the covenant of
Works, (though according to the <hi>covenant
of Grace,</hi> which <hi>giveth new mercies,</hi> whoſe
<hi>privation</hi> we are capable of, we may have
<hi>new puniſhments,</hi> which the <hi>firſt ſin</hi> did not
bring us under). As to the pain of loſs it is
clear; becauſe when we have forfeited all,
we can forfeit no more: but by the firſt ſin
we forfeited all. But this is not becauſe
the ſin in its own nature hath not the ſame
demerit as the firſt: but becauſe man is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of no greater privation than he hath
incurred already; nor of any greater tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if the firſt ſin deſerved as much tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as mans nature was capable of. So
that <hi>terminative</hi> here is no new ſuper-added
puniſhment, according to the firſt Law.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:97269:80"/>
But yet none may hence conclude that here
is no <hi>new guilt;</hi> becauſe it is another <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentaliter
&amp; formaliter.</hi> For divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
may have the ſame <hi>Terminus.</hi> We
do by <hi>following ſins</hi> incur a <hi>new</hi> and further
<hi>obligation</hi> to the <hi>ſame penalty;</hi> which would
be to a greater penalty, were we capable of
it naturally. When a Felon is guilty of
death on one crime, yet twenty bills may be
brought in againſt him, which may charge
him with a <hi>manifold guilt,</hi> though but of
<hi>one death.</hi> As a man may have a manifold
right to one good thing which he poſſeſſeth,
and a right ſuper-added to his firſt right, (as
God hath the right of Redemption to us,
ſuper-added to the right of Creation); ſo
may a ſinner have ſuper-added, and manifold
obligations to the ſame puniſhment. Yet
here we ſee ſome difference between our firſt
guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, and all ſuper-added
guilt; that the firſt having deprived us of
all our felicity, none that follows can deprive
us of any more, (except of the <hi>mercies new
given us</hi> by the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which the <hi>meer ſins of
Parents</hi> ſhall deprive no man of, that <hi>diſown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them).</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. 22.</hi> Though it be but an imperfect
analogical guilt, which the act of <hi>Adam</hi>'s,
or other Parents ſin doth directly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
leave upon us; yet the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:97269:81"/>
or pravity of our own nature, inherent
in each perſon, which by <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced,
doth bring on us a further guilt.
And ſo <hi>mediately</hi> the ſaid <hi>actual ſin</hi> doth
bring it. Which occaſioneth ſo many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Divines to place original ſin (as ours)
in this <hi>pravity alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. 23.</hi> Though this <hi>natural depraved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
may ſeem to infer a <hi>leſſer guilt,</hi> becauſe
it is not <hi>voluntary,</hi> as our <hi>actual ſins</hi> are: Yet,
1. we being <hi>ſeminally in him</hi> that <hi>voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
cauſed it; and, 2. it being the <hi>habitual
pravity</hi> of the <hi>will</hi> it ſelf, and ſo far <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary;</hi>
and, 3. therefore containing <hi>virtually</hi>
all future <hi>actual voluntary ſins;</hi> 4. and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>more</hi> contrary to God's holy nature and
will, than one <hi>ſingle actual ſin</hi> would be; it
hath therefore many aggravations inſtead of
that <hi>one,</hi> which it ſeemeth to have leſs of:
And ſo muſt needs bring a true and proper
obligation to puniſhment, (till Chriſt diſſolve
it), as well as <hi>actual</hi> ſins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. 24.</hi> It ſeems to me that the ſins of
<hi>neerer</hi> Parents may do much to the <hi>corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
of our <hi>natures,</hi> as well as the <hi>ſin of
Adam;</hi> and to <hi>increaſe the pravity</hi> that from
his <hi>only ſin,</hi> would have been upon them.
Proved, 1. There is the ſame <hi>reaſon</hi> why the
ſins of immediate Parents ſhould deprave
the nature of Poſterity, as there is that
<hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin ſhould do it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:97269:81"/>
Some Divines ſay that God <hi>took away</hi> his
<hi>image</hi> from <hi>Adam:</hi> ſome that he <hi>took away</hi>
his <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and ſo the loſs of his image fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed:
ſome that <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin did <hi>it ſelf</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy,
or blot out that <hi>image.</hi> As to the
firſt; I ſay, 1. It is not ſound; becauſe it
makes God the moſt proper immediate, (if
not the only true) efficient <hi>cauſe of ſin,</hi> and
of the <hi>ſinning ſin,</hi> which is the worſt of ſins:
Alſo, becauſe there is no word of God that
ſaith any ſuch thing. 2. If it were true,
the ſin of <hi>Cain</hi> deſerved the ſame, as well as
the ſin of <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the ſecond opinion, I ſay, 1. It is
yet undetermined <hi>(de nomine)</hi> among Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
whether it be not the Redeemer only
that giveth the ſpirit, and whether it can
<hi>properly be ſaid</hi> that God gave <hi>his ſpirit</hi> to
<hi>Adam</hi> in innocency? though I am for the
affirmative. 2. But ſuppoſe that there be
ſome <hi>conſerving aid</hi> which God did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw,
by what <hi>name</hi> ſoever it be called: yet
thaat <hi>withdrawing</hi> was in order of nature
conſequential to mans ſinning, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it: and that ſin it ſelf did deprave the
ſoul. 3. The ſin of <hi>Cain</hi> deſerveth the like
deſertion as well as the ſin of <hi>Adam:</hi> but
man's nature is not now capable of it in the
ſame ſort as then it was, becauſe then we
were innocent, and had the perfect image of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:97269:82"/>
God upon us, and were capable of loſing it:
but now we have loſt it already, our Parents
ſins can but <hi>remove us further from God,</hi> and
<hi>hinder our recovery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third opinion ſeemeth moſt warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
that <hi>Adam put away,</hi> or <hi>blotted</hi> out
God's image, and ſo depraved his own ſoul:
(for which ſee <hi>Capel</hi> of <hi>Tempt,</hi> and <hi>Theſ.
Salmurienſ. Vol. 1. diſp. de ſtatu hominis
lapſi ante gratiam; ſect. 19, 20, 21.)</hi> But
there is the ſame reaſon why <hi>Cain</hi>'s ſin ſhould
deprive his poſterity of God's image, ſave
only that they had not the ſame to loſe: for
the deſtructive nature of the ſin is the ſame,
and ſo is the <hi>merit.</hi> And though they have
not that perfect image of God now to loſe,
yet they have ſome remnants of moral vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
aſſiſted by the light and law of nature;
and the nature of man is capable of being
<hi>made worſe</hi> than yet it is: And there is the
ſame reaſon why <hi>Cain</hi>'s ſin may make it
<hi>worſe,</hi> as there is why <hi>Adam</hi>'s may make it
<hi>bad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Man's fall was a change of his <hi>end:</hi> He
<hi>firſt</hi> took <hi>God</hi> for his <hi>ultimate end,</hi> and chief
<hi>good:</hi> He was ſeduced to take him for one
that <hi>envied his felicity,</hi> and for a <hi>liar,</hi> and to
ſeek his felicity in the <hi>creature,</hi> againſt the
command of God. The ultimate end of
man's actions being thus changed, all moral
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:97269:82"/>
good is ſo far perverted; for all means and
ſubordinate ends depend on it. And ſo the
ſtream of mans actions are turned into a
wrong channel; the ſenſitive appetite is
hereupon become the maſter-principle in the
ſoul, as ruling the reſt. For, as <hi>Placaeus</hi>
ſaith, <hi>ubi ſup. Cujus facultatis finis proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
eſt hominis ultimus, ea caeteris omnibus
facultatibus, tanquam architectonica, imperat:</hi>
that faculty whoſe neereſt end is mans ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
end, doth rule all the other faculties, as
the maſter of the work. And thus man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
turned finally to ſenſibles from God, his
nature is depraved, and God's image defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
Yet is not the ſoul removed to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
diſtance from God; for then he ſhould
be as bad as the Devils, and all men ſhould
be equally evil; and the ſenſitive appetite
would ſo uncontrouledly reign, that man
would be worſe than bruitified, his reaſon
ſerving only to purvey for the fleſh, ſo that
the light and law of nature would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
him, nor any thoughts of a God, and
a life everlaſting, once ſtop him in his ſin.
Now it is apparent that there is the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
(and meritorious) force in <hi>Cain</hi>'s ſin to
turn his nature further from God, as was in
<hi>Adam</hi>'s to turn it ſo far away: Or if man
were at <hi>the worſt,</hi> yet his following ſins have
the ſame power to <hi>fix</hi> him in that miſery, as
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:97269:83"/>
his firſt had to bring him into it. For they
alſo are a wilful turning from God to the
creature, as well as the firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 2.</hi> It is paſt all doubt that the ſinners
own perſonal nature is made worſe by his
<hi>own actual ſin:</hi> experience proves it too ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
Scripture ſaith, that <hi>they that have been
accuſtomed to do evil, can no more learn to do
well, than a Blackmoor can change his skin, or
a Leopard his ſpots.</hi> And there is no reaſon
that I know of that can be given, why a
more corrupt Parent ſhould not beget a child
more corrupt, and deliver him the ſinful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of his pravity, as well as that all
ſinful depraved Parents ſhould beget depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
children: And though this controverſy
be mixed with the great difficulties about the
propagation of the ſoul, and the matter of
its corruption, yet which way ſoever thoſe
be determined, it makes not againſt the thing
that I aſſert. If the ſoul be <hi>ex traduce,</hi> and
ſo corrupted, then the caſe is moſt eaſy. If
man beget the ſenſitive ſoul corrupted, and
God do then promove that to the excellency
of being a rational ſoul, (as ſome think the
material ſpecies of the phantaſy is raiſed by
the active intellect to be the intelligible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material
ſpecies); ſtill there is the ſame
reaſon why the more corrupt Parent ſhould
propagate a ſoul more corrupt, as that all
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:97269:83"/>
ſhould propagate a corrupt one. If the ſoul
be depraved either by a taint from the body,
or by a willing accommodation of it ſelf to
the body, through the force of the natural
deſire of union, <hi>(de quo vide Placaeum ubi
ſupra,)</hi> as water to the ſhape of the veſſel
that it is put into: ſtill the reaſon holds
the ſame for the degree of corruption, as for
the thing it ſelf. That God by way of
<hi>penalty</hi> ſhould <hi>create</hi> the ſoul <hi>ſinful immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,</hi>
ſeems plainly to make him the Author
of ſin: But if it were ſo, yet there is the
ſame reaſon of demerit, to provoke him to
create the ſoul of <hi>Cain</hi>'s ſon yet more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
as there is in <hi>Adam</hi>'s to provoke him to
create it ſinful at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 3.</hi> Beſides, experience aſſureth us,
that all children bring not an equal degree
of pravity into the World, if we may judge
by their firſt exerciſe of reaſon, or uſe of
paſſions. But if there were no difference
made ſince, it ſhould ſeem that all ſhould be
corrupted alike, (further than God cureth
any, and ſo maketh a difference.) We ſee
alſo that many of the children of the moſt
vicious people are more vicious than the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
ſort of men are. We ſee alſo that
ſome mens bodies being diſtempered by their
vices, they propagate thoſe bodily diſtempers
to their poſterity; which we evidently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:97269:84"/>
do make a great alteration on the ſoul:
from whence we ſee ſome perſons very ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
and ſilly, yea ſome ideots, and ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
talkative, ſome extreme paſſionate,
ſome luſtful, ſome malicious, ſome glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
ſome drunkards, and this above the
corrupt inclination which appeareth in the
ordinary ſort of men; and plainly ſed by
the temper of the body.</p>
            <p>Obj. 1. If our corruption were increaſed
by the ſins of immediate Parents, then the
World would grow worſe and worſe, and we
ſhould have been Devils long before this age.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> Moſt Divines ſay that the firſt
ſin would have done all this, if God in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
had not prevented or remedied it. 2. God
ſtill reſolveth to keep the World in order
under his Government; and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth
corruption, and will not ſuffer it to
grow, as according to its nature it would.
3. This is one of the common benefits that
the World receiveth by the grace of the
Redeemer, that they grow not as bad as elſe
they would. 4. For the ſake of the Church
God will reſtrain them.</p>
            <p>Obj. 2. We ſee many of the worſt men
have good children.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No mans corruptions do put his
children into a remedileſs condition: and
therefore God may ſanctifie whom and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:97269:84"/>
when he pleaſeth. So may he do alſo by
the Parents themſelves, for all their ſins; and
yet thoſe ſins do make them worſe.</p>
            <p>Obj. 3. Then you may ſay that Grace is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
by generation from our immediate
Parents, as well as ſin: and yet experience
telleth us the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> This makes as much againſt the
propagation of original corruption from
<hi>Adam,</hi> as from our neerer Parents. If it
were of any force, it would be againſt both.
2. There is ſo great a difference between
grace and ſin, that quite alters the caſe.
For, 1. Grace is ſomething extrinſecally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious,
and now (as to the cauſe of it,
and manner of working it) ſupernatural:
but ſo is not ſin. 2. Grace is an adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
perfecting quality: Sin is a defect, (as
it is in the rational faculties). But defects
are more eaſily propagated, than adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
qualities: for one requireth nothing
thereto but a defective nature; (for nothing
can convey to another that which it hath
not it ſelf:) but the other requireth more
than nature to its propagation. No ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
knowledge or skill in Languages,
Sciences, Arts, or Manufactures, are propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
to poſterity by nature: but the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of theſe is natural. 3. But above all,
it's conſiderable that original ſin, ſo far as it
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:97269:85"/>
containeth a <hi>poſitive inclination,</hi> ſeems to be
<hi>radically</hi> in the inordination of the <hi>ſenſitive
appetite,</hi> raging againſt the rule of reaſon,
(though the rational faculty be corrupted
too, and gives up it ſelf to the ſlavery of the
ſenſitive; yet the ſenſitive ſeems to be the
root.) Now it is evident that nature doth
much in propagation of the ſenſitive, (or
elſe man ſhould do leſs in generation than a
beaſt). But Grace is radically ſubjected in
the rational faculties, (though by participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
alſo it reach the ſenſitive:) and here
nature doth leſs in propagation. We ſee
by experience that a natural gentleneſs and
calmneſs of the paſſions, and ſuch other lower
common virtues as are ſubjected in the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
part, are born with ſome men; and
from the temperament of the body, one
man is more mild, patient, temperate than
another: but it is not ſo with the intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Perfections, nor Chriſtian Graces, Faith,
Hope, or Charity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I ſhall now proceed to prove ſo much of
the affirmative, as I have here owned more
than is now held,</hi> viz. That there ariſeth to
children from the ſins of their neereſt Parents,
ſuch an imperfect guilt, ſo called by analogie of
attribution, as that God may in vindictive
juſtice inflict on them for the ſame, the penalty
<hi>(ſo called by the ſame analogy)</hi> both of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:97269:85"/>
death, and of eternal, at leaſt as to the
penalty of loſs; ſuppoſing that it be not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
through Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And this I prove by theſe following Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 1.</hi> If we are guilty of <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt
ſin, on that account, becauſe we were <hi>ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi>
in him, and are <hi>propagated from him,</hi>
then are we guilty of our <hi>neerer Parents ſins</hi>
on the ſame account. But the antecedent is
true: <hi>go.</hi> ſo is the conſequent.</p>
            <p>Here I ſuppoſe it granted that <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt
ſin is imputed to us, and we guilty of it:
for I now deal not with thoſe Divines that
deny it, but with thoſe that maintain it:</p>
            <p>For as I ſaid before, if we are not guilty
of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, then I muſt give up my cauſe,
and confeſs that we are not guilty of the
ſins of our neerer Parents. Suppoſing then
the imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin to us, I muſt
Firſt prove that the reaſon of that imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is, becauſe we are propagated from him,
and were ſeminally in him. 2. That on
the ſame reaſon, we have the like guilt of
neerer Parents ſins.</p>
            <p>1. For the firſt, I may ſafely premiſe this,
that as in all relations there muſt be a relate,
correlate and foundation; and as to the
diſconformity of a crooked line from the
rule, there muſt be the <hi>crookedneſs</hi> of the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:97269:86"/>
               <hi>line,</hi> and the <hi>ſtraightneſs</hi> of the <hi>rule;</hi> and is
the <hi>rule</hi> will not give you ground to deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
the <hi>line diſconform</hi> or <hi>crooked,</hi> unleſs
it be truly ſo: even ſo there muſt be <hi>merit</hi>
on mans part, conſiſting in performance, or
ſome participation in the evil, before the
Law (which is the rule) will judge him
<hi>guilty.</hi> The Law is firſt the <hi>rule</hi> of <hi>duty,</hi>
and then the <hi>rule</hi> of <hi>judgment.</hi> And it firſt
ſhews them to be <hi>guilty</hi> of the <hi>ſin (reos cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pae)</hi>
before it ſhew their <hi>obligation to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
(reatum poenae.)</hi> This being ſo, it ſeems
clear that the doctrine (of too many) that
lay the <hi>chief</hi> or <hi>only cauſe</hi> of man's guilt and
puniſhment upon <hi>God's covenant,</hi> is not
ſound. They ſay God made a covenant
with <hi>Adam</hi> that he ſhould ſtand or fall for
all his poſterity: that is, as ſome expound it,
that his deſert of life or death ſhould be
imputed theirs: and as others; that if he
ſinned, he and his poſterity ſhould be guilty
of death; and if he did not ſin that firſt
ſin of eating the forbidden fruit, both he
and his poſterity ſhould be confirmed in
their happineſs, as the good Angels, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
fall afterward: And this covenant, ſay
they, makes us guilty of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, though
we have not a <hi>natural intereſt</hi> to make us
guilty; and ſo God imputeth it to us, not
becauſe it <hi>was ours</hi> before the <hi>imputation,</hi> but
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:97269:86"/>
becauſe he is pleaſed to <hi>make it ours</hi> by that
<hi>imputation,</hi> or by his <hi>covenant.</hi> That it is
not the <hi>imputation</hi> or <hi>covenant</hi> that prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
makes us guilty, but determineth us
guilty of the fault who are ſo in our ſelves,
and conſequently determineth us guilty of
puniſhment; I prove thus:</p>
            <p>1. Elſe it ſhould be God only or prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
that ſhould make us ſinners, and not we
our ſelves, nor our Parents: But that's moſt
falſe: <hi>go.</hi> The conſequence is moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent.
If a man be therefore a ſinner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
God by his covenant or imputation
ſaith he is one, and not becauſe he is firſt
made one by himſelf, or Parents, then God
is the principal, if not only cauſe of ſin.</p>
            <p>2. Yea, then God ſhould make a man a
ſinner by that Law whoſe eſſential nature is
to prohibit and hinder ſin.</p>
            <p>3. Or elſe thus; God's judgment (by
Law or Sentence) is ever according to the
truth of the thing: (He judgeth or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
things to be as they are, and not as
they are not.) But if he ſhould determine
or pronounce a man a ſinner that is not, his
judgment were not according to truth: but
he ſhould make that which is falſe become
true by judging it true; which is no tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
conceit.</p>
            <p>4. If it were without any antecedent
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:97269:87"/>
ground in us, that God's covenant doth judge
or make us guilty of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, (or God
impute it to us,) but meerly becauſe he <hi>will</hi>
do it; then on the ſame reaſon might God
have made or judged the <hi>innocent Angels,</hi> or
the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> guilty of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin:
yea, he might have imputed it to the Sun, or
Moon, or any creature. For if real inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
ſecure not us from being made ſinners
by God, or reputed ſuch, then it would not
ſecure them: Or if God's will to impute it
be enough, without an antecedent intereſt
to ground that imputation upon, then there
is no difference, as to intereſt in that ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and us: But that's too groſs a
conceit to be defended.</p>
            <p>5. There is no ſuch covenant of God
with <hi>Adam</hi> mentioned in Scripture, as lays
the final ſtanding of his poſterity upon that
firſt obedience, or diſobedience of his, much
leſs that determineth that they ſhall be
judged guilty for his ſake, of more than they
are guilty of indeed, by natural intereſt.
The foundation of the relation is in our
ſelves.</p>
            <p>I conclude therefore that it is moſt certain
that there is in man ſome ſufficient ground
or cauſe why God's Law ſhould denominate
or judge him guilty before it do ſo. And
this cauſe can be no other than one of theſe
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:97269:87"/>
two: either becauſe we were <hi>ſeminally in
Adam,</hi> and are his children; or becauſe God
making his covenant as the Rector of all
<hi>mankind,</hi> did make it upon ſuppoſition of a
<hi>virtual conſent</hi> contained in the very <hi>nature
of man,</hi> and ſo ſuppoſing that what we ought
to do, we would do, and that if all men had
then exiſted, we ought to have conſented to
<hi>venture our felicity</hi> upon <hi>Adam's act,</hi> and to
run the <hi>hazard<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of periſhing</hi> with him, on
condition we might be <hi>ſaved with him</hi> if he
ſtand; and ſo ſuch a ſuppoſed conſent is the
ground of our <hi>guilt.</hi> But, though I will
not exclude this laſt ground, yet certainly it
is upon a ſuppoſition of the former, or elſe
it is none at all. For man was not to exiſt
till the fall was paſt, and therefore could not
be ſuppoſed to exiſt. And if God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
to <hi>create</hi> every individual perſon to
the end of the World, of <hi>nothing,</hi> as he did
<hi>Adam,</hi> without any derivation from him;
what virtual conſent can be ſuppoſed? or
on what ground ſhould it be preſuppoſed
that we would all conſent to live and die
with him, any more than with the Angels
that fell? or any more than the good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
might be ſuppoſed to conſent to ſuch a
thing? I conclude therefore that the firſt
ground of our intereſt in <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, or our
guilt of it, is our being his <hi>off-ſpring,</hi> and then
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:97269:88"/>
               <hi>ſeminally</hi> in him; and next, that God might
make <hi>one Law for him</hi> and all that <hi>ſhould
come</hi> of him, as ſuppoſing the equity of
their conſent: yet by that Law, he hath not
(that I know of) involved them in his firſt
ſin any more than in his ſecond or third;
nor offered them happineſs meerly on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of his avoiding that <hi>firſt ſin,</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they ſhould afterwards do themſelves;
nor yet promiſed to make them impeccable,
or prevent all after ſin.</p>
            <p>2. It being then our <hi>natural intereſt</hi> that
is the firſt ground of our guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s
actual ſin, (ſo far as we are guilty): and we
being as truly the children of our <hi>neere Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi>
as of him, and <hi>ſeminally</hi> in <hi>them</hi> as
well as in <hi>him,</hi> it follows that we have the
ſame natural intereſt in their ſins as in his;
and therefore the ſame guilt, and reaſon
why God ſhould impute them to us: Unleſs
the change of Laws do make a difference,
which if it do, it can be no more, than by
adding the Law of Grace to that of Nature
to remedy its obligation: For the nature of
things being ſtill the ſame, the ſame Law of
nature ſtill remains: and therefore children
muſt now be naturally guilty of all Parents
ſins, as well as then, before that guilt be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
by remiſſion. Though now God will
not puniſh the adult meerly for Parents ſins
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:97269:88"/>
imputed to us, yet he might do it if he
would, ſuppoſing he had not by the Law of
Grace determined the contrary, if it be
proved that he might do it then.</p>
            <p>Moreover, as then God might ſuppoſe a
civil intereſt in <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, (as we were
parts-future of the ſame World of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,)
on preſuppoſition of our natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
(as his off-ſpring;) ſo now (though
our Parents be not the root of mankind as
<hi>Adam</hi> was; and that's the main difference,
yet) ſeeing our neereſt Parents may be the
root of Families, or other Societies, whereof
God is alſo the Rector, he may ſuppoſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſort of civil intereſt or guilt of their
ſins upon us. As he imputed <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin to
us as he was Rector of all mankind, ſo may
he our neerer Parents as he is Ruler of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
or of ſome more remote, as Ruler of a
Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But that Law which made us guilty
of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, is abrogated, and inſtead of it
is made the Law of Grace. God doth not
now ſay to any, In the day thou ſinneſt thou
ſhalt die.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I know that commination ſtands
not alone, and unremedied; and I yield that
the promiſſory part is ceaſed: but ſtill
every ſin doth leave upon us a guilt of
death, till Chriſt take it off; or elſe what
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:97269:89"/>
need could we have of the pardon of
it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But that Law was particular and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive,
[in the day thou eateſt thou ſhalt die]:
<hi>go.</hi> it is ceaſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The particular prohibition of that
act of eating is ceaſed, <hi>ceſſante objecto:</hi> But
that particular was grounded on, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed
a general, and that which you call
poſitive (how fitly, I now enquire not) was
firſt <hi>natural,</hi> as to the duneſs of penalty for
each particular ſin. The Law of nature firſt
ſaith <hi>[death is the due wages of ſin].</hi> or <hi>[every
ſin deſerveth death]:</hi> and this <hi>Law</hi> doth ſtill
remain. So that though, as to the event,
we have not that reaſon to expect eternal
death now, for Parents ſins, (nor for every
ſinful act of our own,) as before the promiſe
of Chriſt we might have had; yet that is
not becauſe the Law is abrogated, which is
the very ſtanding <hi>Law of nature,</hi> nor becauſe
now each ſin deſerveth not ſuch death: but
becauſe we have now a <hi>remedy</hi> at hand to put
away the guilt. I am ſure, this is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneſt
judgment of thoſe Divines that are
moſt againſt Arminianiſm; for they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that all the unbelievers are ſtill under
the Law of works it ſelf, as to the curſing
and puniſhing power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 2.</hi> If we receive the guilt of <hi>one ſin</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:97269:89"/>
from our immediate Parents, then may we
as well receive the guilt of more: But we
do receive the guilt of <hi>one from them:
go.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The antecedent is plain: For we receive
from them the guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin. It is <hi>theirs</hi>
before it can be <hi>ours. Adam</hi> delivered it not
<hi>immediately</hi> to us. As we received our <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
and <hi>perſons</hi> from our <hi>neereſt Parents,</hi> ſo
did we therewith our <hi>guilt of that ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The conſequence is proved, in that there
is the <hi>ſame reaſon</hi> of both. Why did not
our Parents propagate us free from the guilt
of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin? Becauſe they were not free
from it themſelves naturally; and therefore
cannot give us a better nature than they
have themſelves.</p>
            <p>And ſo on the ſame reaſon it muſt follow,
that being themſelves guilty of other ſins,
they cannot convey to us a nature not guilty
of them. If one be therefore <hi>ours</hi> becauſe
it was firſt <hi>theirs,</hi> and our nature from them,
the other muſt be ſo too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> The Law makes the difference: for
God hath not made us liable to Juſtice for our
neerer Parents ſins, as he did for the firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is already anſwered. The Law
indeed makes a difference as to the <hi>event and
execution,</hi> and <hi>actual remaining obligation:</hi>
but not as to the <hi>deſert.</hi> The Law declares
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:97269:90"/>
and ſhews men to be <hi>as they are,</hi> and doth
not judge unequally of men that are equal,
or of equal actions. The ſame Law, though
<hi>remedied,</hi> is ſtill ſo far in force.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Our Parents, if faithful, are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
and juſtified, and therefore cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
to us the guilt of any ſin, becauſe they
have it not themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It muſt be carefully underſtood,
that pardon takes not away, 1. either the
<hi>reatum culpae,</hi> ſo as that perſon ſhould here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
be judged not to have done what he
did, or not to have ſinned in ſo doing: 2. nor
yet the <hi>natural merit</hi> of puniſhment, as if
that ſin, and the perſon for it, did ceaſe to
<hi>deſerve</hi> death; but only it <hi>remitteth</hi> the <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
deſerved,</hi> and takes away the <hi>legal
effectual obligation</hi> to puniſhment, or that
<hi>duneſs</hi> of puniſhment which muſt bring it
upon us. So that Parents may nevertheleſs
convey to their children that natural deſert
which was not removed from themſelves.
2. And then remiſſion being a free act of
God, extendeth no further than he pleaſeth:
and therefore (unleſs the covenant to the
faithful and their ſeed, do pardon all their
guilt to their ſeed as well as themſelves) the
very effectual obligation to puniſhment will
follow the natural deſert of it, to thoſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
that have not ſuch a remiſſion. And if
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:97269:90"/>
this would prove any thing, it would prove
us not guilty of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 3.</hi> If we are guilty of more of
<hi>Adam</hi>'s ſins than the firſt, or than the
eating of the forbidden fruit, then on
the ſame grounds we may be guilty of
the ſins of our neerer Parents: But
the antecedent is true; <hi>go.</hi> ſo is the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</p>
            <p>The antecedent is proved thus. If there
were the ſame cauſes to make us guilty of
<hi>Adam</hi>'s following ſins, as of the firſt, then
th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e is the ſame guilt. But there were the
ſame cauſes: <hi>go.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. We were ſeminally in <hi>Adam</hi> as well
when he committed his ſecond ſin as his firſt.
2. The ſame Law as to the precept and
threatning was in force (as <hi>de futuro)</hi> when
he committed his ſecond ſin, as when he
committed the firſt. 1. It cannot be doubted
but <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned oft between the time of
his eating the fruit, and God's making the
promiſe of a Redeemer. For his ſoul being
depraved, and turned into a wrong courſe of
action, muſt needs act ſinfully. 2. Yea we
could not be guilty of his eating the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
fruit, if we are guilty only of his firſt
ſin. For that was not the firſt. His unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of God, and believing the Serpent, and
others more, did go before it. 3. Yea, the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:97269:91"/>
ſins that <hi>Adam</hi> committed after the Promiſe,
do in their nature deſerve our ſufferings as
much as the firſt, though that deſert had a
remedy provided. If any ſtill reduce all to
God's meer will, and ſay that it was his will
in his firſt actions to deal with <hi>Adam</hi> as the
root of mankind, but not in his later ſins;
I muſt expect, till they bring ſome proof of
ſuch a will of God, or ſuch a Law; and ſtill
ſay, that the will and law of God doth not
make ſinners of innocent men, nor make
ſinners no ſinners any otherwiſe than by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
and ſanctifying them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
were as much in <hi>Adam</hi> after the promiſe as
before, and his ſin was of the ſame demerit
naturally; and therefore we are as well guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of that as of the firſt.</p>
            <p>And then for the conſequent, it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by moſt of thoſe whom we now
oppoſe, that we are equally related to <hi>Adam</hi>'s
later ſins, and to thoſe of our neerer Parents,
(I mean, to all that <hi>Adam</hi> committed before
the propagation of his Progeny.) And
there are the ſame cauſes, as is before mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted.
Though our neerer Parents were
not the root of all mankind as <hi>Adam</hi> was,
yet are they as much a cauſe of us and our
nature, and of ſo much of mankind as ſpring
from their loins, as <hi>Adam</hi> was. And all
the progeny of <hi>Cain</hi> did ſpring as truly from
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:97269:91"/>
him as from <hi>Adam:</hi> And all the World ſince
the Flood were as truly in the loins of <hi>Noah</hi>
as of <hi>Adam:</hi> and ſo naturally equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed
in their ſins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 4.</hi> If our natures may be corrupted
more by the ſins of our neerer Parents, then
may they be guilty by them as well as by
<hi>Adam</hi>'s. But the antecedent I have before
proved: <hi>go.</hi> The conſequence depends on the
fameneſs of the reaſons, that guilt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation
ſhould concur from our neerer Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
as well as from our firſt: And it ſeems
that participation in guilt is pre-requiſite to
the depravation of nature; elſe it might
ſeem ſome kind of injury to us, that another
ſhould have power to make us ſo miſerable.
Sin is commonly called <hi>the puniſhment of
ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 5.</hi> If God may without any injuſtice
bring death both temporal and eternal on
the ſon of a ſinner, without intending it as
a puniſhment to the Son for the Father's ſin;
then may he alſo without injuſtice (nay in
juſtice) inflict the ſame death as a penalty for
the Father's ſin: But the antecedent is true;
as I prove thus. 1. That which all Rulers
may do without injuſtice, that God may do
without injuſtice. But all Rulers may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
injuſtice deprive the children of a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
or other offender, of thoſe enjoyments
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:97269:92"/>
which the Father hath forfeited himſelf, and
which were to have been conveyed from the
Father to the child, if the Father had not
forfeited them. If a Traytor forfeit his
Lands, and Honours, his Son is juſtly depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of them, though the Prince intend it
not as a puniſhment to the Son. Becauſe
the Father cannot convey to his Son that
which he hath not himſelf; as having loſt it
on his forfeiture: and the Son hath no right
to it when the Fathers right is gone. So if
a wicked man do forfeit his right to all bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
in this life, or that to come, he cannot
convey a right to his Son which he had not
himſelf. And what other way ſhould that
Son have ſuch a right, unleſs God ſhould
give it him; which he is or was free to do
or not. It's true that God by a new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
hath given this everlaſting life to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers:
but that's not to all; nor doth that
deny them to be guilty of their Parents ſin
before, nor yet that it deſerveth death ſtill as
to its nature, and might bring it, were it not
pardoned.</p>
            <p>2. God hath no obligation on him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Law of works, to give health,
peace, or any bleſſing in this life, much leſs
eternal glory to the ſon of a ſinner.</p>
            <p>2. And for the conſequence, 1. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from what is ſaid, that God cannot be
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:97269:92"/>
charged with hard or cruel dealing, in regard
of any wrong that we ſhould ſuffer, if he
puniſh us (thus by deprivation) for our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
ſins: for if it be no cruelty to do the
ſame thing upon the meer <hi>occaſion</hi> of their
ſins, (which is unqueſtionable,) then it is no
cruelty to do it in reſpect to their ſin, as the
deſerving cauſe. 2. And for the point of
juſtice, as it is already proved to be <hi>non in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtum,</hi>
ſo it may be proved to be <hi>juſtum,</hi>
thus. Where there is a real participation in
the ſin, there it is juſt that there ſhould be a
participation in the puniſhment, becauſe of
that ſin. But we did really participate in
the ſin, as of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo of our neerer Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents:
<hi>go.</hi> For the minor: they that were
ſeminally in them, (though not by perſonal
exiſtence) did really participate with them
in their ſin. But we were ſeminally in
them: <hi>go.</hi> This will be further confirmed
in that which followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 6.</hi> If we ſhould have been guilty of
the ſin of our neereſt Parents, though <hi>Adam</hi>
had never ſinned, then are we guilty of them
now: But the antecedent is true: <hi>go.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I ſuppoſe that <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned,
and our neereſt Parents had. If any ſay
this is not to be ſuppoſed. I anſwer; Though
it may not be affirmed to have ſo been, yet
we may in diſpute ſuppoſe it had been. Nor
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:97269:93"/>
have I yet ſeen it proved that God made any
ſuch promiſe to <hi>Adam,</hi> as to confirm all his
poſterity, on condition that he did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
that, or any ſin. If <hi>Adam</hi> had begot a
poſterity no better than himſelf was in his
firſt created perfection, and under the ſame
Law, then they would have been peceable
and mutable as he was, and liable to the
ſame penalty upon their ſin as he was. But
<hi>Adam</hi> would have begot a poſterity no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than himſelf, for ought we can find by
Scripture, which no where promiſeth him a
better, that is, an immutable or indeſectible
poſterity: and they would have been under
the ſame Law; for it was ſuited to their
perfect nature: <hi>go.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From what is ſaid, the antecedent is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
For if we ſhould have been as much
<hi>in</hi> our neereſt Parents as we were in <hi>Adam,</hi>
and they have been under the ſame: Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
then their ſin would have brought on us the
ſame guilt and puniſhment. For example,
if <hi>Cain</hi> had been the firſt ſinner, and <hi>Seth</hi>
had been innocent; the poſterity of <hi>Cain</hi>
would have been all guilty and corrupted,
as <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity now is. For the ſame
cauſes would have produced the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
            <p>The conſequence is clear, in that <hi>Adam</hi>'s
ſinning firſt can be no cauſe why we ſhould
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:97269:93"/>
not be guilty of the following ſins of our
neerer Parents, which otherwiſe we ſhould
have been guilty of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 7.</hi> None can be naturally the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators
of a nature better than their own, (or
a perſon better than themſelves.) But if Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
who are manifoldly guilty of death
did propagate a nature not guilty, then ſhould
they propagate a nature (or perſon) better
than their own: <hi>go.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I muſt explain my meaning, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing
of evil poſitive (if ſuch be)
and privative: Between evils adhering to
our nature or eſſence, and thoſe that adhere
but to ſome integral part: Between a total
privation and a partial: Between a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
real or phyſical, and relative. And ſo I
conclude that, 1. I ſpeak not here of poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
evil, as ſuch, (if ſuch there be,) but of
privative. 2. I ſpeak not of every evil that
adhereth only to ſome part, and not to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it ſelf. For I know a lame man may
beget a Son not lame, and a ſick man may
beget a ſound child. 3. Nor do I ſpeak of
ſuch a partial privation which may conſiſt
with the prevalency of the contrary; and
which nature may ſupply, or overcome.
4. Nor yet of a privation of ſome phyſical
good, (though that be another part of our
unhappineſs,) but of a relation or right.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:97269:94"/>
5. Nor of a privation accidentally accrewing
to the perſon, and limited to himſelf alone
by the will <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> another; but of one that is
without any ſuch limitation, naturally, or by
neceſſary reſultancy fallen upon him.</p>
            <p>Furthermore it muſt be obſerved; 1. that
the guilt that we now ſpeak of is no natural
being, but a relative, and that not proper
and compleat, but, as we may call it, a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative
relation, participating of the nature
of a proper relation but little more than a
natural privation doth of natural being.
A right to life is a true relation, which by
ſin we are deprived of: yet becauſe there is
not only the <hi>non debitum habendi,</hi> but the
<hi>debitum non habendi,</hi> I will not deny but
even in this privation there is a kind of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio
rationis.</hi> 2. Obſerve that we are not
now ſpeaking of the duneſs of poſitive tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
for I ſay nothing of that in this
point of guilt of progenitors ſins. 3. Note
that many learned Philoſophers and Divines
affirm that all evil is a privation of good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally;
(ſee <hi>Barlow</hi>'s <hi>Exercit. de Natura
Mali.)</hi> And if that hold, then it ſeems that
our Parents ſins do bring upon us a guilt of
all evil of puniſhment: for when they have
forfeited all good, they can convey no right
of any to us. 4. Note alſo, that right to bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs
more or leſs, doth not adhere to the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:97269:94"/>
nature of man as man; (for then thoſe in
Hell ſhould have it:) but it is a ſeparable
thing, depending on the will of God: And
therefore our Parents may convey our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
without any right to ſuch bleſſings.
5. When I ſay that it is naturally, and by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
reſultancy, that a ſinner is thus guilty,
I do not exclude God's free will as the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
cauſe in making Nature it ſelf, and
the Law: but the indifferency, or non-neceſſity
of the effect when the cauſes are
once in nature thus laid. Gnd might have
choſen to have made man ſuch as he is, that
is, man: and having ſo made him, whether
he might have choſen to make him that Law
which we call the Law of nature, I will not
now diſpute; (though I think not: becauſe
that Law of nature is nothing but the very
nature of man himſelf, conſidered as related
to God, and withal the nature of the whole
creation; which all <hi>per modum ſigni</hi> do ſhew
man the will of God concerning what ſhall
be due <hi>from man,</hi> and <hi>to man.)</hi> But this is
clear, that God having freely made man in
that relation, and under that Law as he did,
his breach of that Law doth then by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
neceſſity bring him under guilt: for if
the <hi>ſubjectum, fundamentum &amp; terminus</hi> be
put in being, the relation cannot be avoided;
for that were a contradiction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:97269:95"/>
Having given this explication, I ſuppoſe
little more need to be ſaid for the proof of
the premiſes. For the major, it ſeems now
clear, that a perſon who hath loſt his right
totally to life, or any bleſſing, cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
to another perſon, of whom he is the
root, a nature that hath right to that life or
bleſſing. For <hi>nemo dat quod non habet.</hi> 2. And
this ſeems plainly to be no meer negation of
right, (in the derived nature,) but a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Becauſe if our progenitors had none
of them ſinned, we ſhould have been born
with that right which now we want; and
ſo we had ſeminally and virtually a right
our ſelves: which being loſt, it is a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to us, and not a meer negation; and ſo
a puniſhment, and not a meer affliction:
Yet as the right of our Parents themſelves,
(as <hi>Adam)</hi> who were perſonally exiſtent,
was a more full and proper right than ours
who were but ſeminally in them; ſo our
privation is not in ſo plenary and proper a
ſenſe called a privation, nor a puniſhment, as
theirs is, or as our own is for our actual ſins:
And ſo our guilt is not ſo full and proper a
guilt; but analogically ſo called, as <hi>Accidens</hi>
is called <hi>Ens.</hi> And this ſeems to me to be
the true difference between our guilt of our
Parents ſins, and of our own: and our pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
for theirs, (original from <hi>Adam,</hi>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:97269:95"/>
or others,) and of our own actual ſin. And
perhaps <hi>Zuinglius</hi> meant thus, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
Original ſin to be properly called ſin.
So far as ſuch a ſeminal right or poſſibility
which the ſeed hath through the Parent,
doth differ from the Parents own right; ſo
far there is a difference in the formal nature
of penalty and guilt, upon the loſs of that
right. It is doubtleſs ſome more loſs that
the Son of a Traytor hath, by his Fathers
forfeiture of his Lands, than a ſtranger may
be ſaid to have by that forfeiture, who never
was in a poſſibility of enjoying them. It is
therefore no meer negation, but a privation,
and conſequently participateth of the nature
of penalty, and the obligation thereto of the
nature of guilt. And thus in the major
propoſition of this Argument I place the
very reaſon of original guilt, from <hi>Adam,</hi> or
any Parents.</p>
            <p>The minor is plain: If <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
to <hi>Abel</hi> a nature that hath right to life,
or that is not deprived of the right it was in
poſſibility of, or ſeminally had, then he
ſhould propagate a better nature than his
own, and give that which he had not to give.
And ſo if our neereſt Parents, who are by a
manifold obligation deprived of that right,
ſhould convey to us a nature that is deprived
of it but by a ſingle obligation, they alſo
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:97269:96"/>
ſhould propagate a better nature than their
own. But that cannot be. God by his
Grace may make us better than our Parents:
but they by natural procreation cannot.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 8.</hi> Where puniſhment may juſtly
follow, there guilt did go before: But pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of children for their Parents ſin
committed while they were in their loins,
may juſtly follow: <hi>go.</hi> there guilt did go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>The major is proved, in that all puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is for ſome fault, whereof the perſon
puniſhed was ſome way guilty. Obj. <hi>It ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth
that another were guilty of it: Anſw.</hi>
One mans ſin deſerveth not another mans
puniſhment, further than that other doth
ſome way participate in the guilt. Only
we muſt diſtinguiſh between <hi>guilt</hi> by perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
commiſſion or omiſſion, and guilt by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and reputative, or by natural participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Only <hi>Adam</hi> or other Parents were guilty
by perſonal commiſſion or omiſſion, as to
thoſe particular ſins: but we are guilty by
natural participation, in that we derive all
our nature and perſonal being from perſons
ſo guilty: And we are guilty by reputative
participation, of the ſins of mankind, (in
<hi>Adam,)</hi> and of the Societies that we are
members of, <hi>(quoad nudum meritum,</hi> ſtill,)
in that we are juſtly reputed to conſent to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:97269:96"/>
partake of the benefits or penalties of ſuch
Societies, when we voluntarily become and
continue members of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Chriſt himſelf was juſtly puniſhed,
and yet was not guilty of our ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He was not guilty by <hi>commiſſion,</hi> or
by <hi>natural participation:</hi> but he had an <hi>ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical
guilt</hi> by <hi>reputative participation;</hi>
that is, <hi>by his own voluntary ſponſion,</hi> putting
himſelf <hi>quoad poenam</hi> in the room of finners:
but mark the limitation; it was but <hi>quoad
poenam,</hi> that he undertook this task, <hi>viz.</hi> that
though he were not properly guilty, yet he
conſented <hi>to ſuffer as if he were guilty,</hi> for
the ſakes of them that were. So that his
<hi>own conſent</hi> was a juſt cauſe of the <hi>derivation
of the penalty</hi> to his own perſon which did
not commit the ſin; and ſo that <hi>analogical
guilt</hi> was inſtead of proper guilt. It may
well he ſaid that Chriſt was guilty <hi>ad poenam,</hi>
as obliged to puniſhment, in that his own
conſent was ſufficient to induce an obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to puniſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> May not God's pleaſure bring on us a
reputative guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, and not of our
neerer Parents? ſeeing he hath abſolute power
over us, and therefore his will may ſerve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of our conſent, as the will of a Parent
may be inſtead of the infants will.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> God bringeth not guilt on any by
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:97269:97"/>
efficiency, or making them ſuch as <hi>deſerve
puniſhment:</hi> but by <hi>imputation</hi> and <hi>adjudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>
Otherwiſe God ſhould be the cauſe
of <hi>ſin, as ſin:</hi> for ſo to make <hi>guilty,</hi> is to
make a man <hi>really a ſinner.</hi> Our Parents
may <hi>will ſin,</hi> and ſo may do it <hi>for us,</hi> becauſe
we are <hi>ſeminally</hi> in them: but God cannot
<hi>will ſin.</hi> Our Parents by willing it, do firſt
become ſinners themſelves, and then convey
the guilt to us: but ſo cannot God. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therefore but by <hi>reputation</hi> and <hi>adjudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
that he judgeth men ſo guilty of ſin,
it is apparent that his judgment muſt have
ſome ground in the nature of the thing;
and the man muſt <hi>be guilty</hi> before God <hi>judge
him</hi> ſo: for his judgment is according to
truth. And therefore it muſt needs be that
there muſt be ſome reaſon in our ſelves why
<hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin ſhould be <hi>judged ours,</hi> or why we
ſhould be judged liable to puniſhment for it:
and that muſt be, becauſe we derive our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
from him: And then there is the ſame
reaſon for our guilt of neerer Parents ſin,
ſave only that God hath ſince more freed us
from the <hi>danger</hi> of that ſuffering, which by
ſuch ſins we might have undergone, (as he
pardoneth to us <hi>Adam</hi>'s imputed ſin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.)</p>
            <p>The minor of the Argument will be anon
cleared in the following Arguments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:97269:97"/>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> It is indeed a puniſhment that is due
to children for their Parents ſins: but it is
only to the Parents that it is formally puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and to themſelves it is but materially
ſo, and ſo but affliction, becauſe the ſin, and ſo
the guilt, was only the Parents, though the child
be the ſubject of the ſuffering.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If this were granted, it would
ſtill hold good, that God may juſtly lay that
ſuffering which is materially puniſhment,
upon children, for the ſins of immediate Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
2. If this were ſo, then it will equally
follow that we may not be formally but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially
puniſhed for <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, ſeeing the
reaſon is manifeſted to be the ſame. 3. I have
ſhewed that there muſt be ſome reaſon on the
part of the ſufferer, why he ſhould ſuffer for
another mans ſin: Now with us in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
caſe, it is evident that the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we are their ſeed, and have our natures
from them: <hi>go.</hi> this is a leſs-perfect, or ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical
guilt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> God doth inflict ſufferings on the beaſts
for mans ſin, without any cauſe on their part:
<hi>go.</hi> he may do ſo by infants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. God is not the <hi>Rector of Beaſts</hi>
in a <hi>moral proper ſenſe;</hi> but only in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
improper ſenſe, as a Pilot ruleth a Ship,
or an Herdſman Cattel: And therefore he
hath made no Law for them, nor hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:97269:98"/>
his fidelity to them concerning the
conditions of their happineſs or miſery, as
he hath done to man: And therefore bruits
are not capable of ſin or puniſhment, though
they be of ſuffering. So that childrens caſe
and theirs do differ. 2. Yet when the bruits
ſuffer for mans ſin, it is becauſe of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to man: And therefore children muſt
ſuffer becauſe of their relation, which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
and ſo neer that it makes them truly
capable of guilt. So that according to the
ſubject, the ſame ſuffering receives a various
form and denomination, and ſo doth the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation.
In the perſonal committers of
the ſin, there is <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>puniſhment</hi> due to
them, in the primary, fulleſt, and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
ſenſe: on the children that were then
in their loins, it is <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>puniſhment,</hi>
more imperfectly, as by analogy of attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
in the bruits, when ſacrificed, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
for their Maſters ſin, it is but equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally
<hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>puniſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall proceed to ſome Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Arg. 9. Deut. 28. 18. Curſed ſhall be the
fruit of thy body. <hi>Children are curſed for
the ſins of immediate Parents:</hi> go. <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> It is only to the Parents that it is a
puniſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:97269:98"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> True in the primary ſenſe: but as
the children participate of their nature, ſo
alſo of the nature of guilt and puniſhment.
It is a threatning of natural evil to a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
creature, becauſe of a moral evil,
which he hath ſome participation of: <hi>go,</hi> it
is by participation a true puniſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> You may as well ſay that the bruits
and inanimates are puniſhed, for they are here
curſed too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This was anſwered even now.
The ſame evil threatned againſt a bruit, is no
puniſhment, which threatned againſt a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
creature, is a puniſhment, becauſe of,
their different capacities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> The meaning of the Text is but this:
Thou ſhalt be denied the deſired fruit of tby bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
<hi>i. e.</hi> your women ſhall be barren.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That may be part of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
but as that is not the full proper ſenſe
of the words, ſo is there no reaſon from the
Text for limiting it to that only; and many
other Texts of Scripture tell us that it is, to
be extended further.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> This was the voice of the Law of
Works, which God doth not now govern the
World by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is a Law which was in
force ſince <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Promiſe: and
therefore not then abrogated. 2. It is as
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:97269:99"/>
much as I plead for, that according to the law
of nature, puniſhment is our due for our
neerer Parents ſins or elſe it had not been put
in this curſe by <hi>Moſes:</hi> But that Chriſt hath
provided a remedy in the Goſpel, for that and
original ſin as from <hi>Adam,</hi> and our actual
ſin it ſelf, I thankfully acknowledge. I ſay
not therefore that eventually any ſhall periſh
for the imputed act of his Parents ſin, to
whom it is pardoned by the Grace of
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 10. Exod. 20. 5.</hi> It is expreſſed in
the moral Law it ſelf, <hi>[For I the Lord thy
God am a jealous God, viſiting the iniquity of
the Fathers upon the children to the third and
fourth Generation of them that hate me;]</hi> ſo
<hi>Deut. 5. 9.</hi> and ſo God proclaims his name
to <hi>Moſes, Exod. 34. 7.</hi> Here then is a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
determining puniſhment to be due to
the children for their neerer Parents ſin: for
God <hi>will viſit;</hi> that is, in juſtice puniſh it on
them. The objections before anſwered, I
paſs by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> This is only againſt thoſe children
that do themſelves tread in their Fathers
ſteps.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, as to the adult. But it is
the Parents ſins that are viſited on them.
Thoſe children are eſpecially threatned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is they that lie under ſuch guilt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unremedied:
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:97269:99"/>
But it's thence plain that it
was the caſe of all, till they receive the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy:
for the childs actual ſin doth not
then begin to make him guilty of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
ſin, but only ſhews him to lie under
that guilt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Yes; it is by conſenting to our Parents
ſin when we come to age, that we become guilty
of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That's not the firſt guilt: and
that <hi>conſenting</hi> brings not on us the ſame for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
numerical ſin or guilt that was on our
Parents; (for one accident cannot paſs from
one ſubject to another, nor remain in two
ſubjects:) but it brings only a guilt of the
<hi>like ſort;</hi> ſo that ours is but the <hi>guilt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting</hi>
to their ſin: But the Text here ſaith
expreſly, that it is <hi>the ſins of the Fathers</hi> that
are <hi>viſited on the children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> It is meant of children in an ethical
ſenſe, that is, not natural, but the heirs of
their vices.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is plain in the Text that it is to
<hi>natural children,</hi> and therefore the third and
fourth Generation are mentioned: (though
it's true, that it is not all thoſe children that
<hi>lie under</hi> that guilt, but only thoſe that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
their vices.) Otherwiſe the threatning
ſhould be equally to any other mans natural
children, that imitate your ſin: But that's
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:97269:100"/>
againſt the plain Text: Though it be true,
that any other mans children that imitate
your ſin, are liable to puniſhment for ſuch
imitation: yet not for your ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. 11. Eph. 2. 3. 11, 12. [Were by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the children of wrath, even as others.—Remember
that ye being in time paſt Gentiles
in the fleſh,—that at that time ye were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Chriſt, being aliens from the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and ſtrangers from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants
of Promiſe, having no hope, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God in the World.]</hi> The firſt words are
commonly underſtood of a ſtate of wrath
derived from Parents by natural Generation.
If that be not the meaning, then I confeſs it
makes nothing to prove either the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, or other Parents; nor
native corruption neither: But if that be
the ſenſe, as is commonly judged, then is
there no intimation for a reſtriction of it to
<hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, as the only cauſe of our deſert
of that wrath; nay, the later verſes, and the
whole ſcope of the place gives it as a ſpecial
reaſon; that <hi>[they were Gentiles in the fleſh].</hi>
So that it ſeems to me ſome ſtate of wrath
which <hi>Iſrael</hi> was not under, that is here
meant; or at leaſt, ſome what more to them
as the ſeed of the Gentiles, than was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> It appears alſo from the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
verſes, that when Chriſt took away
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:97269:100"/>
the enmity, ſo that the Gentiles were no
more ſtrangers and foreigners, but fellow-Citizens
of the Saints, and of the houſhold
of God, and no more without God, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
Hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that Chriſt did deliver the
Gentiles from a ſpecial puniſhment (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
guilt) which lay on them and their
ſeed, more than on the Jews.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Gal. 2. 15. [We who are Jews by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and not ſinners of the Gentiles]</hi> which
intimates plainly that the Gentiles were by
nature in a worſe ſtate than the Jews: and
therefore had by nature ſome more guilt
than they.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> That is not becauſe the Gentiles
were by nature guilty of any more than
<hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, but becauſe the Jews were by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
freed from that guilt; which made the
difference.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I confeſs that may be <hi>much,</hi> taking
the word <hi>[nature]</hi> but as the cauſe of the
perſons to whom the benefit is given, and
not as the cauſe of the gift, or thing given.
But yet that ſeems <hi>not all</hi> which is meant,
when we are called <hi>[ſinners of the Gentiles,
and ſtrangers and foreigners,</hi> &amp;c.] For theſe

Fill ye up then the meaſure of your

that it appeareth that it is not only their <hi>own

comes on them, but even that very blood
that was ſhed by their Parents before they
were born. 4. He gives the reaſon from their
natural participation, <hi>[whom ye ſlew:]</hi> and
<hi>[ye are the children of them that killed,</hi> &amp;c.]

you have your nature from them, it's juſt
that all this be imputed to you, and that you

plain evidence, that we may be juſtly puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the ſins of our neerer Parents, as any
is in Scripture to prove the imputation of
<hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin. 1. <hi>David</hi> deſireth a curſe upon
this ſinners poſterity, even before they are
born, or before he knows what they will
prove. 2. And this is not becauſe of <hi>Adam</hi>'s
ſin, though that alſo lay upon them; but, as

God would remember the <hi>iniquity of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and not blot out the ſin of his Mother:</hi>
which cannot be meant of any puniſhment
that <hi>David</hi> would have God inflict on that
Father or Mother. He is not of a ſpirit ſo
cruel and contrary to the Goſpel, as to deſire
that God would not forgive them that are
dead long ago, and either in joy or miſery;
when he knew not whether they died peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently,
or impenitently. If any ſay that he
did know by the ſpirit of propheſie, or ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
viſion, that they did die impenitently,
and are in hell: 1. I deſire them that affirm
it, to prove it. 2. If ſo, what need he deſire
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:97269:102"/>
that God would not forgive them, or blot
out their ſin, which he knew was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
poſſibility. 3. But the next words in
the Text ſhew that he ſpeaks only of the
ſin of the dead Anceſtors, as it lieth on the
poſterity, and not on themſelves: For as it
was not the <hi>dead,</hi> but the <hi>living,</hi> that <hi>David</hi>
prayeth againſt, ſo he next ſaith, <hi>Let them
be before the Lord continually, that he may cut
off the memory of them from the earth.]</hi> So
that it is a penalty on him that then was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and upon his poſterity, that <hi>David</hi>
prays for, even that his Parents ſin may be
remembred againſt <hi>him,</hi> and <hi>his</hi> ſin remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
againſt his children; and not that any
of them may be remembred againſt the
dead, who, for ought he knew, might ſome
of them be pardoned in Heaven.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> It is but temporal judgments that
<hi>David</hi> deſires for the Parents ſin.</p>

temporal; becauſe it was not yet the fulneſs

of time for Grace, and the great fruits and
concomitants of it to be revealed to the full.
Life and immortality are brought to light
(in a greater meaſure) in the Goſpel. 2. I
have proved in the beginning, that If God
may inflict temporal death on children for
Parents ſin, then alſo may he inflict eternal,
as to the penalty of loſs, and ſo much of the
pain of ſenſe as the apprehenſion of that
loſs muſt needs infer. He that depriveth
man of life, depriveth him of all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts

leave him his life without thoſe comforts, if
he pleaſe.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:97269:105"/>
In the next place we muſt anſwer ſome
more of the chief objections, beſides what
are already anſwered on the by. And firſt
I will anſwer thoſe that make equally againſt
the imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s or our neerer Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
ſin: And becauſe learned and judicious
<hi>Placaeus</hi> hath ſaid more to the matter (in
<hi>Theſ. Salmurienſ. Vol. 1. de ſtatu hom. lapſi
ante Grat. pag. 206, 207. Theſ. 12, 13, 14,</hi>
&amp;c.) than any that I know of, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
of his reaſons; as they are brought
againſt the imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s actual ſin,
to his poſterity; and conſequently make
againſt our participation in the guilt of our
neerer Parents actual ſins.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>He ſaith</hi> it is not agreeable to that of
<hi>Ezek.</hi> The Son ſhall not bear the iniquity of
the Father: for we ſhould bear the iniquity of
<hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This ſpeaks of a Son that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owneth
his Fathers iniquity, and hateth it,
and goeth not in the ſame way; as is plain,
<hi>Ezek. 18. 5, 6. 14,</hi> to 17. and of no other:
ſuch ſhall not die for Parents ſins. 2. But
this is no proof that he never <hi>deſerved death</hi>
for them; but only that through gracious
indulgence, it ſhall <hi>not be inflicted.</hi> So that
this is a paſſage of Grace, and not of pure
Juſtice according to the meer law of
works.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:97269:106"/>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> God ſpeaks it to prove his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and not his Grace: <hi>ver. 29.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is his <hi>ordinate Righteouſneſs</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>promiſe of Grace,</hi> which he
muſt fulfil, and not according to the <hi>meer
law of works or nature,</hi> which he vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth:
It is his juſt and equal dealings with
men compared one to another, ſuppoſing
that they ſtand all upon terms of Grace.
3. And this is yet more plain, in that the
very ſame promiſe, on the ſame ground, is
made to them that <hi>repent, and turn from
their evil ways:</hi> ver. 21, 22. Certainly the
promiſe of <hi>pardon of ſin is a promiſe of Grace,</hi>
and not an effect of the pure law of nature
or works. So that the reaſon here why that
Son, who himſelf doth <hi>that which is lawful
and right, ſhall not die for the Fathers ſin,</hi> is
the ſame as why a <hi>repenting ſinner ſhall not
die for his ſin,</hi> ver. 21, 22. which can be no
other than <hi>pardoning Grace;</hi> which is ſo far
from proving that there <hi>was no precedent
guilt,</hi> that it undoubtedly proves that <hi>there
was:</hi> for where there is <hi>no guilt,</hi> there can
be <hi>no pardon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This anſwer ſhall ſerve alſo to thoſe that
confeſs the imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, and
yet from hence argue againſt the imputation
of other Parents ſins. To which I ſhall add,
as to them, that this Text is no more againſt
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:97269:106"/>
one than the other: <hi>go.</hi> if it be not againſt
the former, it is not againſt the later. Let
them ſhew any intimated difference.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Saith</hi> Placaeus, It agreeth not with right
reaſon. <hi>For,</hi> 1. If <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin be imputed,
then his obedience ought to be imputed, if he
had continued innocent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The word <hi>imputation,</hi> as ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
I purpoſely avoid, unleſs where I may
explain it: but not the ſenſe before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.
I grant that to be true, which he
ſuppoſeth abſurd: But I ſay withal, that
yet <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>imputed righteouſneſs</hi> alone
would have ſaved none that had had the
leaſt perſonal unrighteouſneſs of his own.
Becauſe <hi>bonum eſt ex cauſis integris,</hi> we
ſhould have been innocent as we came into
the World; but yet the next ſin of our
own would have ſpoiled that innocency.
2. Further, I ſhewed before that there is not
the ſame reaſon for conveying accidental be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
to nature, as for conveying a nature
deprived of them. In caſe of privation, the
Parents cannot convey what they have not:
But though they had it, yet it followeth not
that they ſhould convey it, if it were a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
accident ſeparable from nature: as
for example, any right to a reward that
<hi>Adam</hi> might be ſuppoſed to attain by his
obedience: this might be proper to himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:97269:107"/>
3. <hi>He addeth,</hi> [at leaſt, all the ſins which
<hi>Adam</hi> committed while we were in his loins,
muſt be imputed to us.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I grant it, and ſay that ſo they are:
yet with the fore-mentioned difference, that
the firſt ſin depriving us of <hi>all title</hi> to all
God's benefits, the ſecond could deprive us
of no more; and ſo could add no more guilt
<hi>terminative,</hi> but only <hi>fundamentaliter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>He adds,</hi> [ſo ſhould all the ſins of our
intermediate Parents, ſeeing when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
them, we were as much in them as in
<hi>Adam.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I grant all, with the laſt mentioned
difference: Let thoſe that go on other
grounds anſwer the Objector as well as they
can.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>He adds,</hi> [yea the death of <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould
be ſo imputed to us: for if he ſinned as the
Head of mankind, why ſhould he not alſo be
puniſhed in the ſame reſpect? If we were not
bound to obey that prohibition, but in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
ſurely neither to be puniſhed: for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
belongs no otherwiſe to us than the
prohibition.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But withal conſider, that though
God might have ſatisfied his juſtice with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
<hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo putting an end to
humane race; yet, 1. He was no way bound
to do this: He that a little before bid man
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:97269:107"/>
               <hi>encreaſe and multiply,</hi> might let him enjoy
his forfeited life: that was no injuſtice.
2. Yea, when God had ſo lately made ſo
glorious a ſtructure for the demonſtration
and communication of his goodneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it
may ſeem in wiſdom much fitter for him to
let the ſinning creature live, while he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth,
propoundeth, and applyeth a remedy,
than preſently to deſtroy the works that he
had made, though man deſerved it. 3. I pray
you mark then the grounds that I go on: I
ſay not that we <hi>perſonally were then guilty
in</hi> Adam; but that we draw a guilt with
our <hi>natures from</hi> Adam. God having in
juſt and merciful wiſdom reſolved that we
ſhall ſurvive, and ſo humane nature be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated,
it can be no other but a <hi>guilty</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that is ſo propagated, which God is not
bound to hinder; but rather in wiſdom not
to hinder it, if that might be called an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>It is further objected,</hi> [Moreover, how
did we ſin in <hi>Adam</hi> actually, who were never
actually in him?]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> I ſay not that <hi>we then ſinned in</hi>
Adam <hi>properly;</hi> no more than that we <hi>did
exiſt in</hi> Adam. For, as I know that <hi>exiſtere
eſt eſſe extra cauſas,</hi> ſo I know that the act of
ſin, and the relation of guilt, are accidents
that muſt have an <hi>exiſtent ſubject,</hi> if they
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:97269:108"/>
exiſt: and therefore we cannot be ſinners,
and guilty before we are. But I ſay, that
when we firſt <hi>are,</hi> we have a <hi>nature</hi> received
from a <hi>guilty progenitor,</hi> and therefore a
<hi>guilty nature,</hi> becauſe he cannot convey to
us the <hi>right to felicity</hi> which he loſt. 2. We
were <hi>ſeminally</hi> in <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo ſinned in
him: though I know, as to perſonal actual
exiſtence, this is but <hi>terminus diminuens,</hi> yet
is it more than meerly <hi>potential.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. <hi>It's objected,</hi> [How could that act be
voluntary as to us, which was long paſt before
that we had any will?]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As we did not <hi>perſonally exiſt</hi> in
<hi>Adam,</hi> ſo did <hi>we not will</hi> that act in <hi>Adam:</hi>
But yet when <hi>we received a will from</hi> Adam,
it was <hi>quaedam natura,</hi> and <hi>guilty</hi> of what <hi>his
will</hi> was guilty, though not by the guilt of
actual commiſſion, yet of <hi>derivation</hi> and <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation:</hi>
And thus it is <hi>reputatively voluntary.</hi>

            <p>8. <hi>It's next replied to ſome of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
reaſons on our part;</hi> [There was indeed
humane nature in <hi>Adam;</hi> but ſingular, and
divided from this of ours. And if the firſt
act of ſin were an act of nature, why not alſo
the firſt act of generation? yet no man will ſay
that in <hi>Adam</hi> we did beget <hi>Cain</hi> or <hi>Seth.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This makes nothing againſt me,
who ſay not that we then ſinned in <hi>Adam
properly:</hi> but that we received a <hi>guilty na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:97269:108"/>
from <hi>Adam;</hi> which then began to be a
ſinful or guilty <hi>nature or perſon,</hi> when it
began to be a <hi>nature or perſon;</hi> and before
that was but a <hi>guilty ſeed.</hi> 2. Faults and
puniſhments being <hi>quid moral vel civile,</hi> a
<hi>political</hi> thing, may be <hi>moraliter &amp; reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
transferred: and therefore as a man
may ſuffer as a membe<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a ſinful Society,
though <hi>perſonally innocent,</hi> ſo might we as
branches of mankind. But generation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>quid naturale,</hi> there is no ſuch ground
for ſuch an imputation, or reputative tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it. So that the caſe is not alike.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>It follows;</hi> [And if <hi>Adam</hi> did deſerve
to himſelf a puniſhment equal to that his ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that is, as great as God had threatned, ſhall we
think that Juſtice will require other puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
from innumerable other men for that
ſame ſin?]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. Adam</hi> did deſerve a puniſhment as
great as his <hi>perſonal nature</hi> was capable of,
and alſo the ſame to all that ſhould come
from his loins. If God had deſtroyed him
before he had any poſterity, it would indeed
have prevented the propagation of guilt, by
preventing the being of a capable ſubject;
but yet there would have been in <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin
a <hi>deſert</hi> of ſuch a propagated guilt, or a <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for it,</hi> on ſuppoſition that there were
a <hi>nature</hi> from him propagated. I deny
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:97269:109"/>
therefore the Antecedent, on ſuppoſition that
God would let the courſe of humane gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
go on, according to the newly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
Law of nature: It was not only to
his own perſon that <hi>Adam</hi> deſerved this
puniſhment. Or thus I may deny the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence:
Though <hi>Adam</hi> deſerved puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
only to his perſon, yet it being to his
<hi>whole perſon,</hi> and our perſons being then <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally</hi>
in his, and ſo <hi>after exiſting</hi> from his,
it follows, that what he deſerved to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
is propagated to thoſe to whom that
perſon propagates a being; ſeeing it is of
himſelf, and out of himſelf, that we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
and not by a meer efficient cauſality,
as in creation, or fabrication, but he affordeth
us our matter.</p>
            <p>10. <hi>It's further objected,</hi> [Either that ſin
had but one adequate guilt, which was to be
divided among all <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity; or as
many guilts as men: If the firſt, then it is
but a little of that ſin that is imputed, or of
the puniſhment that is due to each of us ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.
If the later; then one ſin ſhould not
have one guilt, nor one adequate puniſhment,
but innumerable.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>fundamentum</hi> is ſin; and that
is <hi>one:</hi> ſo the guilt is <hi>one fundamentaliter &amp;
ſubjective primario;</hi> but more than <hi>one fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentaliter
&amp; ſubjective per derivationem:</hi>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:97269:109"/>
on ſuppoſition, that according to the courſe
of nature the <hi>one firſt guilty ſubject procreate
more;</hi> for thereby ſin is propagated with,
and in nature. If the Law of this Land
do ordain, that a Traytor and his poſterity
be all diſinherited and baniſhed; you may
here put your dilematical queſtion, and as
you anſwer it, ſo would we. If the Law of
God deprive rebellious man of all his feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
and leave him his natural being, he will
beget a poſterity therefore deprived of it,
becauſe they are his poſterity; Call this one
<hi>guilt or two, as you pleaſe:</hi> I call it <hi>one fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally,</hi>
and <hi>one ſubjectively while there
was but one ſubject;</hi> and <hi>many conſequently
by propagation,</hi> when that one ſubject is as it
were multiplied into many. So that this is
but about words, and not things.</p>
            <p>11. <hi>It's further argued;</hi> [Laſtly, if we
are therefore guilty of <hi>Adam</hi>'s diſobedience,
becauſe we are his Sons; ſo that neither the
miraculous generation in reſpect of both Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
(ſuch as was <hi>Iſaack</hi>'s and <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi>'s,)
nor yet a divine creation of the ſoul
without the operation of man, can exempt any
man from it: what then ſhall we ſay of our
Lord? For his miraculous Conception by the
Holy Ghoſt did not hinder him from being tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> ariſing from the fruit of
<hi>David</hi>'s loins.]</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:97269:110"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I confeſs this objection hath oft
ſeemed more difficult to me than all the reſt:
but I ſee no reaſon that it ſhould overthrow
all our grounds. For it ſtands on the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of many uncertainties; eſpecially
about the way of humane generation, and
the natural intereſt of male and female com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively
therein, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But paſſing by all
theſe, (becauſe the very naming of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
I find offendeth many,) I ſtand on the
common anſwer, though the part or intereſt
of <hi>Mary</hi> in Chriſt's Conception was ſo much
as might prove him <hi>man of man,</hi> and give
him the <hi>name of the Son of Man, of</hi> David,
<hi>of</hi> Adam; yet that was but <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi>
or in the ſmaller part: for the intereſt of the
<hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in that Conception was the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
intereſt:</hi> and therefore he is ſaid in
our Creed ſimply, <hi>[to be conceived by the
Holy Ghoſt, and born of the Virgin</hi> Mary;] and
he is principally and more fully to be <hi>called
the Son of God, than of Man,</hi> even according
to his humanity, how much ſoever of his
<hi>material ſubſtance</hi> might be of the Virgin.
This being ſo, he could not ſtand guilty of
<hi>Adam</hi>'s, or any Parents ſin, becauſe in the
<hi>predominant ſenſe,</hi> he was not <hi>one of their
off-ſpring,</hi> but the <hi>Son of God, conceived by
the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> 2. And if the Holy Ghoſt's
Conception do free Chriſt from the <hi>actual
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:97269:110"/>
corruption of his nature,</hi> as your ſelf confeſs;
why not as well from the foreſaid guilt or
imputation, ſuppoſing that ſuch there is?
For why elſe ſhould not natural pravity ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to the ſubſtance which he received from
the Virgin? To imagine that <hi>Mary</hi> was born
without original ſin, is but to make the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
greater; (how ſhe was free that was
not conceived as Chriſt, by the Holy Ghoſt?)
or to run it I know not how far. It were
more plauſible to ſay, that ſhe was perfectly
ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt before Chriſt's
Conception; and therefore could convey
no guilt to him: but what proof this would
have, let them tell that know.</p>
            <p>12. <hi>After theſe reaſons, the judicious
Author concluds thus;</hi> [Theſe things I
thought good briefly to diſpute, following the
authority of moſt grave Divines, (who have
diſallowed this imputation either tacitly by
their ſilence, as <hi>Calvin. Inſtit. Tilen. Theſ.
&amp;c.</hi> or elſe openly, and in expreſs words, as
<hi>Pet. Martyr</hi> in <hi>Rom. 5. Chamier Panſtrat.)</hi>
Firſt, that we may not take that for God's
word which is not his word. 2. That we aſcribe
not that to God which becometh him not. And
that we may free the Chriſtian Religion from
ſuch unneceſſary difficulties. And laſtly, that
we may the ſtronglier prove original ſin as it
is deſcribed, <hi>Art 10.</hi> and 11. of the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of our Churches.]</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:97269:111"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We ſtick not on mens names;
though we have more Divines againſt you.
2. Whether it be God's word, let our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
proof manifeſt. 3. Which if we have
proved, then ſhould not humane reaſon ſay,
<hi>it becomes him not:</hi> eſpecially when the ſame
reaſon confeſſeth the like to become all
Princes and Common-wealths. 4. I think
I have done more to free the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
from difficulties, by aſſerting ſuch an
imputation of <hi>all Parents ſins,</hi> as aforeſaid,
than you have done by <hi>denying all.</hi> 5. And
I think that we may far more rationally
maintain <hi>original corruption,</hi> and the <hi>juſtneſs
of puniſhment</hi> for <hi>original ſin,</hi> if we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the ſaid guilt, than if we deny it, as you
do. So much to this excellent Writer.</p>
            <p>Having anſwered their Objections, let me
add this in the concluſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> If we cannot be guilty of <hi>inherent
original ſin,</hi> without the <hi>derived</hi> guilt of
<hi>Adam</hi>'s actual ſin; then we do derive a guilt
of <hi>Adam</hi>'s actual ſin. But the Antecedent
is true: therefore ſo is the Conſequent.</p>
            <p>That we are guilty of <hi>inherent original
ſin,</hi> is by them confeſſed. But this cannot
be without a cauſe, or foundation. And
the foundation or cauſe muſt be ours,
or elſe the guilt cannot be ours. Now this
foundation is either meerly the <hi>inherent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:97269:111"/>
it ſelf, or ſomewhat Antecedent. Not
meerly the <hi>inherent pravity</hi> it ſelf:</p>
            <p>For, 1. It would prove againſt <hi>no Law:</hi>
for no Law forbad us to be <hi>born as we</hi>

               </gap> which
it could not be, if we had not the guilt of

               <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
or <hi>culpability.</hi> But we could not have had
ſo much as the <hi>eſſe</hi> without an <hi>antecedent
guilt.</hi> Which I prove thus: Either the <hi>being</hi>
of our <hi>original diſpoſitions</hi> is only a <hi>ſin,</hi> or
alſo a <hi>puniſhment.</hi> If it be only <hi>a ſin,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any antecedent <hi>ſin or guilt</hi> of ours, then
either <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man</hi> is the <hi>Author</hi> of it. Not
God; for he is not the author of ſin: and
if he were, it would excuſe of the <hi>guilt</hi>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:97269:112"/>
If <hi>man,</hi> either our ſelves, or our Parents.
Not our ſelves; for we made not our ſelves.
If our Parents; then either their <hi>acts are
imputable</hi> to us, or elſe that would make it
never the <hi>more ours.</hi> So that our corruption
would be <hi>miſerie, at non peccatum;</hi> no more
ſin than the venom of a toad is ſin.</p>
            <p>But it's certain that the very <hi>being</hi> of our
<hi>natural qualities</hi> and <hi>privations,</hi> is a <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
For God would not inflict ſo great
an evil on us as that is, which ſhall ſubject us
to eternal death, for nothing. And this is
commonly confeſſed. Well then, the <hi>eſſe
corruptionis</hi> is in order before the <hi>culpability</hi>
of it. That <hi>eſſe</hi> is truly <hi>poena,</hi> a <hi>puniſhment;</hi>
though not as <hi>cauſed by God,</hi> (for God cauſeth
it not,) yet as <hi>permitted by God,</hi> and as the
conſequent of his <hi>juſt deſertion.</hi> And <hi>omnis
poena eſt peccati poena:</hi> puniſhment is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
related to a fault deſerving it. This
fault was meerly our Parents, or by partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
and derivation ours. If meerly theirs,
then <hi>our corruption</hi> is <hi>meerly their puniſhment.</hi>
For God will not puniſh one for anothers
fault, when there is no ground of imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it to themſelves. But it's certainly
our puniſhment; or elſe it could not make
us inherently ſinful, and ſo damnable
therefore as the penalty is ours, ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
fault muſt be ours: which can be
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:97269:112"/>
nothing but a derived guilt of Parents
ſins.</p>

3. If there be ſuch a thing as actual ſin, how
doth that act make us ſinners? Is it <hi>forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter?</hi>
Then we are ſinners but in the inſtant
of act: for our own acts are preſently gone,
and <hi>nothing,</hi> as well as <hi>Adam</hi>'s. If it be
<hi>cauſaliter,</hi> then <hi>Adam</hi>'s act is confeſſed to
make us ſinners, as our own acts do when
they are paſt. 4. The plain truth is, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
learned <hi>Chamier</hi> ſaw it or not) both acts
and habits make us ſinners in the ſame kind
of cauſe, (and ſo may <hi>Adam</hi>'s,) <hi>viz.</hi> as the

is that relation, or the <hi>formalis ratio pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cati,</hi>
(though the <hi>reatus poenae</hi> be but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent.)
And therefore <hi>Pet. Martyr</hi> on

ſelf, <hi>(cont. Pighium.)</hi> Now men call the

conſtitutiva,</hi> as the whole eſſence of ſin is
made up <hi>of them,</hi> (as <hi>meritorious matter,)</hi>
and of the <hi>relation together.</hi> If we will be
Logical, we muſt be accurate, or we cheat
men by words.</p>
            <p>Reader, in concluſion, lament with me the
common <hi>partiality</hi> of the beſt <hi>Diſputers.</hi>
How little did this opinion diſhonour great
<hi>Chamier, Pet. Martyr, &amp;c.</hi> And why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was againſt <hi>Pighius</hi> and <hi>Salmeron</hi>
that they wrote it: oppoſition to whom I

when <hi>Placaeus</hi> ſaid the like, or leſs, with
what a heap of authority doth <hi>Rivet</hi> (well)
overwhelm him? For then it was not the
Papiſts that were concerned in the diſpute.</p>
            <p>I ſhall next ſpeak to thoſe objections
which are made only againſt the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of guilt of the ſins of neerer Parents,
by thoſe that confeſs our guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s
ſin. Suppoſing that of <hi>Ezek. 18.</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
<hi>Deut. 24. 16.</hi> anſwered before.
And they are theſe following:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj. 1.</hi> If we are thus guilty of our neereſt
Parents ſins, then have we two ſorts of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ſin: when as we have hitherto acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
but one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is but <hi>one ſubjective</hi> in each per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and but one <hi>terminative;</hi> that is, it is
but one and the ſame <hi>puniſhment that one and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:97269:114"/>
the ſame perſon is obliged to:</hi> but it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
<hi>fundamentaliter,</hi> as ariſing from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
of <hi>many ſins.</hi> But, 2. if you take the
word <hi>[Original,]</hi> not as ſignifying <hi>all that
adhereth to us ab origine,</hi> but as ſignifying
only that ſin which was the <hi>original or firſt
in-let of all our miſery;</hi> then as there can be
but <hi>one firſt,</hi> ſo is there but <hi>one original ſin,
even</hi> Adam's. 3. As our natures are further
polluted by ſome neerer Parents ſin, ſo may
they be further <hi>guilty</hi> by them. I think I
proved before, that the children of ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
Parents have an <hi>additional pravity</hi> in
their natures, at leaſt as to the <hi>inclination to
she creature</hi> the <hi>terminus ad quem</hi> of their
apoſtacy, more than the generality of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
have as meerly from <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt
ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj. 2.</hi> If we are guilty of the ſins of our
neerer Parents, then this Generation ſhould be
many hundred fold more guilty than the firſt
was; and ſo the laſt man or age ſhould be
the moſt ſinful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> So they are <hi>fundamentaliter,</hi> but
<hi>not terminative:</hi> They have forfeited but the
<hi>ſame felicity</hi> which one ſin may forfeit; for
there is no more to loſe: But it is on a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
<hi>deſert or ground</hi> that they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
that one felicity: and ſo incurred that
one penalty. 2. But this I ſay but on ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:97269:114"/>
that the Parents are none of them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.
For if the Parents be pardoned
themſelves, it is the judgment of very learned
and judicious Divines, that by the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
all their infants are pardoned with
them, as ſoon as they have their being: And
alſo that pardoned Parents cannot convey
that guilt to their children which they have
not on themſelves. And conſequently, that
by the remedy, an interruption is made in
the proceſs of guilt. 3. But then it is ſtill
confeſſed, that the <hi>reatus ſimplex,</hi> as ſome call
it, that is, the meer <hi>natural merit</hi> antecedent
to the <hi>perſons obligation</hi> (which ſome call
<hi>reatus redundens in perſonam)</hi> is not taken
off by pardon from the Parent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not from poſterity.</p>
            <p>But a great difficulty here ariſeth in the
way: How then can the guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s
ſin be conveyed to any of us, ſeeing it was
pardoned to <hi>Noah,</hi> from whom all the World
proceedeth; and how could <hi>Noah</hi> convey
the guilt which he had not?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This objection was before an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
in part. Remember ſtill that the
<hi>meer merit</hi> of <hi>puniſhment, ſimply conſidered,</hi> is
not taken away by pardon: nor the meer
<hi>reatus facti vel culpe.</hi> It remaineth true to
all eternity, that ſuch a <hi>man did commit ſuch
a ſin,</hi> and that that <hi>ſin deſerved death:</hi> (but
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:97269:115"/>
not that he is <hi>obliged to death for it.)</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
alſo that this is communicated to
poſterity with their <hi>nature:</hi> And that it is a
<hi>voluntary act</hi> of God that <hi>remitteth the deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
puniſhment, and pardoneth the ſin;</hi> and
therefore it can extend no further than he
pleaſe. As alſo that this <hi>meer merit</hi> doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a <hi>proper guilt</hi> on every ſoul that hath it,
which makes it <hi>capable of pardon;</hi> though
to <hi>infants</hi> that are pardoned, the <hi>guilt</hi> and
the <hi>pardon</hi> are in the ſame moment of time,
yet in order of nature the guilt goes firſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe things premiſed, I further anſwer,
that there are two opinions of Divines about
pardon of infants. Some think-that only
the elect are pardoned; and ſome (as <hi>Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
Ward, Amyraldus, &amp;c.)</hi> think that all
the infants of Believers (or that are baptized
rightly) are pardoned. According to the
principles of the former it muſt be ſaid, that
when God pardoned <hi>Noah</hi> (or any godly
Parent) and his elect ſeed, that pardon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
firm for ever: but a pardon it is to
the ſeed as well as to the Parent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſuppoſeth guilt, which is by a neceſſary
reſultancy from the natural deſert, till Grace
deſtroy it. But as for that ſeed (as <hi>Cham. e. g.)</hi>
which was not elect, God pardoned <hi>Noah</hi>'s
original ſin but limitedly, intending that it
ſhould not extend to the non-elect ſeed, but
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:97269:115"/>
that they ſhould have a guilt on their ſouls
from that natural merit, as if God had never
pardoned the progenitors. For the deſert
and imputability adhereth to nature, but the
remiſſion will go no further than free Grace
extendeth it. According to the principles
of the later it muſt be ſaid, that God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
to <hi>Noah</hi> (and every godly Parent) the
ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> and all other, and to his infants
while infants; but with this limitation, that
if they themſelves at years of diſcretion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
not, they ſhould not continue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
but periſh, either by the return of
the ſin before ſo pardoned, as ſome think;
or only for the ſuper-added ſin, as others
think. In a word, every Parent begetteth a
Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> and of himſelf a ſinner, and
thereby begets a nature that hath in it ſelf
compared with God's Law, the <hi>fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
reatus,</hi> and this he doth never the leſs
for being pardoned himſelf. Unleſs his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
be pardoned with himſelf, they will
remain guilty: for the relaxation of the
commination being but to his own perſon,
makes only a change on himſelf. The diſeaſe
is natural, and the cure is accidental; and
therefore though he be cured, yet will he
convey the diſeaſe to poſterity.</p>
            <p>To explain this by the like. Suppoſe that
by a ſtanding Law of the Land, all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:97269:116"/>
of any Traytor are to be diſinherited,
diſhonoured and baniſhed. It pleaſeth the
Soveraign not to deſtroy this Law, but to
diſpenſe with it as he ſhall ſee ſpecial reaſons.
Whereupon he pardoneth ſome one of a
traytorous line, with this limitation; either
that this pardon ſhall be but to his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
only, or at moſt but to his ſeed (imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate)
till they forfeit the benefit by ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
rejection. In this caſe, all his poſterity
would be nevertheleſs born guilty of the
foreſaid puniſhment: only that guilt would
be taken off according to the terms in the
Law, and no further. For the Law is ſtill
in force, and univerſal; and the children are
naturally the poſterity of a Traytor, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in one degree or many;) and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
is but a ſingular and ſupra-legal act, and
limited as is expreſſed; and is purpoſed for
the removal of a guilt from the particular
perſons, and not for the preventing it in any
one of them; or if the pardon be univerſal-conditional,
all is one.</p>
            <p>What I have ſaid about <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, will
(more eaſily) anſwer the like objection, as
to neerer Parents ſins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj. 3.</hi> If we are ſo guilty of our Parents
ſins, then Chriſt's ſatisfaction, and God's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of ſin is imperfect: for he pardoneth them
upon Chriſt's ſatisfaction to every believing
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:97269:116"/>
Parent: and if after this they muſt be puniſhed
again on their poſterity, then were they not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
pardoned at the firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The perfection of pardon, and
Chriſt's ſatisfaction, muſt be diſcerned by
conſidering them in their own kind, and in
their perfect ſufficiency to thoſe ends where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God intendeth them, and not according
to miſtaking conceits of men. Pardon is
not ſimply and abſolutely perfect in this life:
<hi>Manoſſeh</hi>'s ſins muſt be puniſhed when he is
dead, on his poſterity. But it hath no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imperfection
diſhonourable to God, or to
Chriſt's ſatisfaction. 2. It is not the ſame
numerical guilt that is pardoned to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and not pardoned to the Son, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
on him. From one ſin there ariſeth
one ſingle guilt to the firſt ſinner, and that
multiplyeth upon the multiplication of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
from his loins: and every perſon hath a
ſeveral guilt, though from the ſame root.
3. Note alſo that this objection makes as
much againſt our guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, as of
our neerer Parents, and more: for they may
ſay, that ſin hath been pardoned to many of
our progenitors, between <hi>Adam</hi> and us. But
it holds not againſt either.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj. 4.</hi> God would not drown <hi>Noah</hi> with
the World; nor deſtroy <hi>Lot</hi> with <hi>Sodom:</hi>
and <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaith, Let it be far from the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:97269:117"/>
Judge of all the earth to deſtroy the righteous
with the wicked.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. God was not then dealing with
the World, or with <hi>Sodom,</hi> for ſuch ſins as
<hi>Noah</hi> or <hi>Lot</hi> were guilty of. So that, though
he might have found ſin in them deſerving
his wrath, yet when he comes to execute an
extraordinary judgment for an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
ſin, he will not deal with thoſe, as with
ſuch extraordinary, or great, or impenitent
ſinners, who were not ſuch. 2. It is juſtice
Evangelical therefore, or on terms of Grace,
and not pure legal Juſtice, which <hi>Abraham</hi>
appeals to for the reſcue of <hi>Lot.</hi> It's true,
it is a <hi>perſonal righteouſneſs</hi> of <hi>Lot,</hi> which he
pleadeth with God for his deliverance from
judgment, even with the Judge of all the
earth; as a neceſſary work of his juſtice:
(which thoſe may note that will have no
<hi>righteouſneſs inherent</hi> in our ſelves pleaded
with God, much leſs with <hi>Juſtice,</hi> for free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from his wrath:) But it is but a <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi>
conſiſting in a freedom from that
<hi>impenitency and wickedneſs</hi> which God came
to <hi>revenge;</hi> and not in <hi>perfect obedience.</hi>
This therefore ſhews not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what God might
do in ſtrict juſtice; but what he will do in
that juſtice which is tempered with (and
prevailed over as it were) by mercy. 3. The
infants of the old World and <hi>Sodom</hi> periſh'd
with them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:97269:117"/>
               <hi>Obj. 5.</hi> Parents ſins are not voluntary as
to us: <hi>go.</hi> not ours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is anſwered before. They
are the ſin of our <hi>wills,</hi> and ſo <hi>voluntary:</hi>
and we come out of them that <hi>voluntarily</hi>
committed them.</p>
            <p>We muſt not look on Parents and children
as on two diſtinct perſons that have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation
from, or dependance on each other:
but conſider that our very being is from
them.</p>
            <p>And that God doth actually puniſh and
deſtroy children for their Parents ſins, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
already by a multitude of Texts. And
who dare ſay that he doth it unjuſtly, becauſe
we are not conſenters? To prove that God
doth it, is enough to prove it juſt, becauſe he
can do nothing unjuſtly.</p>
            <p>As for the great queſtion, whether any be
damned for Original, or Parents ſin, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
Whatever the degree of penalty is,
none can be freed from it but by pardoning
Grace through Chriſt: and therefore none
but thoſe that are the children of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
promiſe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude all with theſe following
Corollaries, containing ſome Uſe of what
hath been ſaid and proved by us in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cor. 1.</hi> This Doctrine of our liableneſs
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:97269:118"/>
to puniſhment for our neerer Parents ſins,
doth much clear up the reaſon of our origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ſin, (as from <hi>Adam,)</hi> and conſequently
much confirm us in the belief of it, and
enable us to anſwer moſt of the cavils againſt
it. And I muſt confeſs for my part, that I
am not able to maintain our guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s
ſin, without this.</p>
            <p>Cor. 2. <hi>It hence appeareth that it is a
duty of all Chriſtians to bewail, and beg
pardon of their Parents and Anceſtors ſins,
as to the puniſhment which themſelves are
liable to for them. They are not only to
confeſs that they are the children of</hi> Adam,
<hi>but alſo the ſeed of Idolaters, ſuperſtitious,
ignorant, prophant, unbelieving Anceſtors;
that their Father was an</hi> Amorite, and their
Mother an Hittite, <hi>Ezek. 16. 3, 4. and that
he whoſe eyes are on all the ſons of men, to
give every one according to his waies and
doings, doth recompence the</hi> iniquity of the
Fathers into the boſome of their children after
them. <hi>Jer. 32. 18, 19. 2 Kin. 22. 13.</hi> Great

               <hi>So,</hi> Jer. 44. 10, 11, 21, 22. The Lord could

            <p>I fear leſt many of us, yea moſt, have been
guilty of not bewailing and praying for the
pardon of our <hi>forefathers ſins,</hi> and deſire
godly men to conſider more of it for the
time to come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cor. 3.</hi> From hence it appears, that it is a
ſad thing to be <hi>born of evil Parents;</hi> and a
bleſſing to be born of thoſe <hi>that fear God:</hi>
and accordingly to be acknowledged.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cor. 4.</hi> Alſo it follows, that if God ſhew
mercy <hi>to the children of wicked Parents,</hi> it is
a <hi>double bleſſing,</hi> and the <hi>freeneſs</hi> of ſuch
Grace is accordingly to be magnified.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cor. 5.</hi> Though bleſſings be <hi>not merited,</hi> as
<hi>curſes</hi> be, yet ſeeing the <hi>natural intereſt</hi> of
<hi>children in their Parents, and Parents in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
is ſo great, you may hence diſcern, that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:97269:119"/>
even to reaſon it is very probable that God
ſhould deal better with the children of true
<hi>Believers</hi> than with others: and that they
ſhould have ſpecial benefit by their Parents
Faith conſidering that God is as prone to
mercy as to ſeverity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cor. 6.</hi> May we not hence ſee ſome
ground to <hi>juſtify God's ſeverity againſt thoſe
infidel parts of the World,</hi> whoſe Anceſtors
have refuſed the Goſpel, and the Lord Jeſus?
And are not thoſe infidels guilty of their
<hi>fore-fathers ſin,</hi> in the ſenſe before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned?
If Chriſt died for them, and offered
them himſelf, his grace and benefits, and
they reject him, it is a juſt puniſhment to
poſterity, if for this ſin of thier Fathers, he
leave their Country in darkneſs, and ſeek out
a people that ſhall give him better welcome.
And if he do not ſo by us, who have ſo abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him, it is not becauſe in <hi>juſtneſs be may
not,</hi> but becauſe in <hi>mercy he will not:</hi> and
the greater and freer is that mercy. If he
promulgate his Laws to the Fathers, and
they reject them, he may take that as a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
promulgation for the obligation of
poſterity, and may judge them for rejecting
that Law or Goſpel: and if they ſay <hi>We ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard it;</hi> it ſufficeth to tell them, It was
ſent among you; and your Fathers would
have none of it, but expelled it out of their
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:97269:120"/>
Countrey; and refuſed to have him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
them reign over them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aquinas</hi> handling this Queſtion, 1. 2.
<hi>Q. 81. art. 2. Vtrum etiam alis pecata
primi parentis, vel proximorum parentum tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducantur
in poſteros?</hi> denieth it; but then
he ſeems not to ſpeak at all of the matter
of meer guilt or imputation, but only of
the traduction of inherent pravity: And
therefore it is nothing to the matter that
we have ſpecially here to deal with; and,
2. even in that his reaſons ſeem not of weight.
The ſumm is, that only <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt ſin did
corrupt nature in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> and others are but
perſonal: The ground of this his aſſertion
is that opinion wherein the Papiſts differ
from our Divines; <hi>viz.</hi> that Grace was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
to <hi>Adam;</hi> and original ſin being
nothing but the privation of that Grace or
Rectitude, and the firſt ſin making a total
privation of that to humane nature, there
is nothing left for after ſins to do of that
kind: This ſeems his full ſenſe, though he
ſpeak it not out in ſo many words. But to
this I ſay, 1. This (as is ſaid) doth not at all
deny that we deſerve puniſhment for our
Fathers ſins, but only that we are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of this puniſhment in <hi>ſpecie:</hi> and ſo
the main thing is granted which we
ſeek.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:97269:120"/>
2. His ſentence about the <hi>ſupernaturality</hi>
of Grace to <hi>Adam</hi> (which yet he affirmeth
to be <hi>concreated</hi> with him) is not proved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The Scotiſts do reſiſt him in it, as well as the
Proteſtants. Read an excellent Diſpute of
it in <hi>Rada</hi>'s firſt Controverſy, ſhewing how
far it is or is not ſupernatural.</p>
            <p>3. His ground, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>[naturals could
not be loſt]</hi> is unproved: There be certain
natural perfections of the mind which are
ſo far under the power of exerciſed reaſon
and free-will, that they may be depraved or
much deſtroyed by the abuſe of theſe.</p>
            <p>4. The word of God, and the experience
of the World doth fully prove that wicked
men grow worſe and worſe, and are prone
to apoſtatize and depart yet further from
God; and that the very light of nature
may be extinguiſhed in part, and ſome men
by cuſtome in ſinning make themſelves much
worſe than they were by nature: <hi>go.</hi> it
is certain that men are not ſo bad by <hi>Adam</hi>'s
firſt ſin, but their nature is capable of being
made worſe: And they are not at the very
worſt till they come to Hell: And in this
life we ſee great variety in degrees of
wickedneſs among wicked men.</p>
            <p>Particularly as to his anſwers to the three
Arguments. To the firſt, (drawn from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
examples of puniſhing children for
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:97269:121"/>
the Fathers ſin) he ſaith it is only corporally,
becauſe the child is as it were a part of the
Father <hi>quoad corpus. Anſw. 1. Corporal
puniſhment</hi> proves that we <hi>deſerve puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
elſe God would not inflict it: for he
will be no more unjuſt in the leſſer than in
the greater. 2. He that deſerves <hi>corporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
for ſin,</hi> deſerves more. 3. The
whole man, ſoul and body is as much from
our <hi>neerer Parents</hi> as from <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the ſecond reaſon, (which is drawn
from Parents traducing <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin to us, and
therefore much more their own,) he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
it would hold were their own ſin
traducible, which he ſaith, it is not; but the
reaſon is before diſproved.</p>
            <p>The third reaſon is, that if we therefore
contract ſin from <hi>Adam</hi> becauſe we were in
him, then may we do it from our other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
becauſe we are in them, ſeeing the
Scripture ſhews we are capable of growing
worſe. To this he only ſaith, that the firſt
ſin corrupteth nature, the ſecond only the
perſon. But this is a bare denial, and no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the force of the reaſon. And unleſs
he diſtinguiſh of common nature, and the
perſons nature, what ſenſe hath it? For to
corrupt the perſon qualitatively, is ſo to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
his nature.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lib. 4. Cap. 18. de

Amiſſ. Grat. &amp; ſtatu pecc.</hi> being of leſs
weight than this of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> needeth no
other reply.</p>
            <p>That we ſhould have been corrupted by
<hi>Original ſin,</hi> if <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Seth</hi> had ſinned,
and not <hi>Adam,</hi> ſee <hi>Aquin. de Malo q. 5. a. 4.
