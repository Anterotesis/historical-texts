         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Have a ſtrange thing to acquaint thee withal,
concerning my Son; which was made known
to him the 20th day of <hi>September</hi> 1671. And
and it is as true as it is ſtrange; the Lord hath
been working ſo powerfully upon my heart,
that I am conſtrained to give the world this True Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
and it is likely to be handed out unto thee by
an unworthy Servant, and alſo by a very weak hand;
but it doth come from a very warm and enlarged
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45186:3"/>
heart; For the Lord hath ſaid, that his ſtrength is
made perfect in weakneſs, and hath wrought my
heart into ſuch a frame, which doth encourage me
that he will aſſiſt me to make known unto thee the
truth, and nothing but the truth, ſo far a, the Lord
hath made it known unto me; And whoſoever thou
art that read theſe lines, I earneſtly begg it of the
Lord, that thou mayeſt believe theſe truths: And
that thou mayeſt not be unbelieving; For it was for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
that my Son was ſtruck Dumb, as I ſhall give
thee an account at large hereafter,</p>
            <p>Only, I ſhall deſire in the firſt place to give thee
an Account what he wos, which may be anſwered in
theſe words; That he was a Diſobedient, Stubborn,
and undutiful Child, for which my heart was much
alienated from him: The following Account will
ſatisfie thee; Inſomuch that <hi>I</hi> had given him over for
loſt, for ever having any hopes or Comfort from him.</p>
            <p>If Father and Friends cannot prevail, we are apt
to give ſuch a Child over for loſt for ever; But bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
be God, He did not give him over, but meets
with him by a ſtrong hand, and by an Almighty power;
And if he ſhall Work, none ſhall Lett; If He ſpeak
but the word, the moſt Rebellious ſhall be made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to come in, and cloſe with the Lord Jeſus upon
his own Tearms. For he ſaith, that he hath Guifts

thou haſt led Captivity Captive, thou haſt received guifts

they come to you in a very plain Dreſs; em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
them, and the Lord work it powerfully upon
thy heart, as it hath been upon mine; and if thou
ſhalt receive any good by it, give God the Praiſe and
Glory of it, and <hi>I</hi> have my end and aim in it; And
I fearing that <hi>I</hi> ſhall neither have time nor ſtrength to
give every one a particular account by word of mouth,
<hi>I</hi> have thoughts to have it Printed, whereby <hi>I</hi> might
give every one ſatisfaction; that may come to make
enquiry into the truth of it.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <p>MY Son going to School to <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Hoſpital,</hi>
there were 10 Boyes ſent to the <hi>Eaſt-India,</hi>
(as he told me) and ever ſince he hath had
a mind to go beyond-Sea; He hath asked
when <hi>I</hi> would put him forth Apprentice? and <hi>I</hi> told
as ſoon as <hi>I</hi> could provide my ſelf with an Apprentice,
then you ſhall go as ſoon as <hi>I</hi> can provide a Maſter
for you; <hi>I</hi> cannot tell how to ſpare you before <hi>I</hi> have
an Apprentice my ſelf; He alſo knew that <hi>I</hi> had no
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45186:4"/>
body to do the leaſt kindneſs for me: He ſaw that <hi>I</hi>
was ſickly and weak, ſo that in my thoughts, and in
the Opinion of others, that <hi>I</hi> ſhould not recover;
But the Lord bringeth to the brink of the Grave, and
raiſeth up again, bleſſed be name of the Lord: But
my condition was not at all conſidered or minded by
him. There was a friend of mine that did give him
good Councel, as he had others that did the like
Office of love; and ſaith, that he ſhould be a dutiful
Child to me, and give me content; He alſo telling
him that <hi>I</hi> ſhould be willing to do any thing that
might be for his good; and if he were more minded
to go to Sea, than for a Trade here, <hi>I</hi> ſhould be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to it; he replyed to my Friend, <hi>I</hi> ſhould be glad
to hear my <hi>Father</hi> ſay ſo; <hi>I</hi> caſt my eyes upon him,
and ſaw tears run down his Cheeks; ſo <hi>I</hi> ſaid unto
him, be a good Child, and as ſoon as <hi>I</hi> have an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice,
<hi>I</hi> ſhall be willing to place you out, for your
good, and that with ſpeed. <hi>I</hi> being a little better in
health now, than what <hi>I</hi> had formerly been; ſo not
long after he commits a fault, and <hi>I</hi> thought he did
deſerve to be corrected for it, and <hi>I</hi> did ſo; and after
<hi>I</hi> gave him the Key of my Lodging-Chamber. <hi>I</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then at my Shop, they being diſtant from each
other, but he did not go home, but went below the
<hi>Tower,</hi> and there be croſt the water, and that night
he went as far as the <hi>Half-way-houſe</hi> towards <hi>Graves-end</hi>
by the <hi>Thames</hi> ſide; and going into the Houſe, he
called for a Pint of Beer or Ale, and ſome Bread, and
while his ſtay there to refreſh himſelf, he falls into
diſcourſe with two Hoy-men as they proved after;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45186:4"/>
and in his Diſcourſe enquires what Ships were going
out; they demanded what Ships did he lack? he told
them any Ships that were going to <hi>Virginia,</hi> or <hi>Jamaica,</hi>
or any place to the Weſtern Plantations, for he had
a great mind to travail, and this was in <hi>Septem.</hi> 1669.</p>
               <p>So they ſeeing him in good Apparel, and perceiving
his deſign, they made a ſtrict enquiry of him what
he was, ſuppoſing him to be an Apprentice; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
what Friends he had, and where they lived?
he told them, his Father was living, but his Mother
was latelie dead; Theſe two men being bound for
<hi>Feverſham</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> to fetch Timber, they agreed to
take him with them; and at their return, to deliver
him to his Father, ſo he went aboard with them, their
Veſſel lying by waiting for the Tide; but their Voyage
being longer that tune, than what was uſual, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
above a month before their return; in which ſpace
of time <hi>I</hi> laid wait all about the Citie for the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie
of him, and went twice to <hi>Graves-end</hi> to ſearch
ſome Ships that lay there, and beyond, and all other
Ships that were outward bound for <hi>Virginia, Jamaica,</hi>
or any of the Plantations that were in the River;
and <hi>I</hi> being both very wearie, and doubtful of
hearing of him, I was reſolved to deſiſt from ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any more at preſent: ſo after this, the Hoy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
and the Man ſent his Wife to me according
to his firſt reſolution? who enquiring if <hi>I</hi> had not had
a Son gone from me? <hi>I</hi> anſwered, <hi>I</hi> had; ſhe repli'd,
if you will go with me as far as <hi>VVapping,</hi> you may
ſee him; which news was very welcom to me, for <hi>I</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:45186:5"/>
had been at a great expence of Monie, time, and
trouble; for by water, up, and down, in and about
the Citie, <hi>I</hi> believe 200 miles at leaſt; and during
his abſence, <hi>I</hi> had no bodie but my ſelf to do any
thing in my Trade; ſo when <hi>I</hi> ſaw him, <hi>I</hi> chid him
for his diſobedience, yea my bowels earned to him;
He was amaſed to ſee me, for it was upon a ſudden
that <hi>I</hi> went down to <hi>VVapping,</hi> immediately after the
Hoy came to the Wharf; ſo I took him home with
me. He ſtaid with me all the next Winter, and the
Spring; and in the Summer-time towards Harveſt-time,
he takes his opportunity on a Sabbath day; I
being hearing the word of God, and he went with me;
but he ſeeing me ſecure for a while, takes another
journey, and that was about 90 Miles into <hi>VVarwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi>
by the way he went to an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nkle of his, my Wifes
brother, to whom he gives an account, that he had
taken that journie in hand on purpoſe to him, that he
would be pleaſed to be inſtrumental to his Father on
his behalf, that he might be placed out; he writ to
me concerning it; I writ to him, it was my reſolution
as ſoon as I had an Apprentice, to provide for him;
ſo after many Letters had paſſed betwixt us, he was
perſwaded to return again to me; and after ſome ſtay
with me, he goeth away again on a Sabbath day ſome
5 mile off, but returned again of himſelf; and indeed
all this while <hi>I</hi> was unprovided of a Boy, for I could
not hear of one till this laſt Summer but we not liking
each other, we parted; and I have another Boy; ſince
his coming, <hi>I</hi> had a reſolution to enquire out a Maſter
for his going to Sea, as ſoon as the Boy was bound.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45186:5"/>
About <hi>Bartholomew-tide</hi> laſt, he committed a fault,
and I reproveing him for it he ſeemed ſomewhat ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,
and withall gave ſome words that I did not
approve of; ſo I ſtruck him, he reſiſted again and
ſtruck me, which did increaſe my paſſion, and cauſed
me to correct him ſeverely, ſo to be clear of me he
crieth out Murder, at which noiſe ſome Neighbours
came in, and when they underſtood that he had
been ſo diſobedient as to ſtrike his Father, they
very much blamed him. So I held him faſt till I ſaw
that he was ſomewhat abated in his ſtubborneſs, and
then let him looſe, and did treat him with mild words.
At laſt he became quieter, and in few dayes after asked
me leave to go to the Fair, I granted it: And when
<hi>Southwark</hi> Fair came; he deſired me to give him
leave to go thither alſo: At which deſire of his, I was
much troubled he ſhould not be ſatisfied with the
former Liberty I had given him at <hi>Bartholomew-tide.</hi>
But he continuing his requeſt ſtill to me, at laſt I
did grant he ſhould go; though not very willing.
So on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> in the Afternoon the 20. of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi>
1671. He went into <hi>Southwark</hi> Fair, and found
it to be a dirty place, did not like it, but goes in
to ſee a play: And when he come forth of the
place, he walked about in it a little, but took no
delight in it, and was troubled that he ſhould come
to ſee it. He returns to came homewards, and
upon <hi>London</hi>-Bridge in the open place, he makes a
ſtand, looking towards the Tower, upon the
Boats and Ships, and leaning upon the place, there
were two Boyes came and ſtood by him, one on
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45186:6"/>
his left Hand, the leſſer of them puts forth a Riddle
and ſaith tell me what is this, that flyes as ſwift
as an Arrow out of a Bow, and carries his Bridle
under his Tail, this was a ship under Sail, there
was a man that ſtood by him on his right hand
and he turned himſelf toward the Sun; and ſaid to
my Sonn before the Sun be down, that ſhall be
tyed that was never tyed before, and before the
Morrow Sun be down, that ſhall be looſe that was
never tyed before. One of the Boyes being very
earneſt with the Man, ſaith, I pray you Sir, tell
me the meaning of this, but he would not. So
the Boyes went away towards <hi>Southwark,</hi> the Man
and my Sonn ſtaid at the ſame place, the Man ſaith
to him, it was a fine thing to be a Traveller, and
my Sonn ſaith to him, I hope I ſhall go very ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
to Sea, and he ſaith to him, have you your
Friends conſent, Yes ſaith he? The Man ſaith to
him he would not have him go to Sea, for if he
did, he would have a great fit of ſickneſs naming
the Flux, and that would coſt him his life. Saith
he, why ſhall I be any more ſick than any body
elſe? It would be ſo, how do you know it? He
ſaid he knew it very well. If you do go, the Ship
and all the Men, ſhall go ſafe to the place where
it was to go, and ſhould all come home ſafe again,
only he was excepted, for it ſhould coſt him his
life. He asked him whether he did believe him,
he ſaith, no, he did not believe him, nor would
not, but he would go to Sea, he endeavoured to
perſwade him to live in <hi>London,</hi> and it ſhould be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45186:6"/>
well for him, and my Sonn ſaith, hang <hi>London,</hi> I
will go and Travel. So when my Sonn takes his
leave of the Man upon the Bridg, he puts off his
Hat in a jearing and deriding way, and ſaith unto
him, I thank you for your good Councel, but in
his Heart at that time he did not intend to take
his Councel; and ſo parts from him, and he
thought the Man had ſtayed there at the place
where he parted from him. So my Sonn coming
homewards, and when he came juſt to the Corner
of <hi>Thames-ſtreet</hi> the Man overtook him, and ſaith,
no further yet? And he ſaith, no, ſo my Sonne
ſeeing of him and ſpeaking to him of a ſudden,
was affraid, and he ſaith be not affraid, I will do
you no harm. So the Man turns with him at the
Corner, and after turns with him into St. <hi>Michaels</hi>
Lane, that comes into <hi>Crooked</hi> Lane, and ſo into
<hi>Cannon</hi> Street. The Man was ſpeaking what a fine
place this City was, if it were all built and inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and that the building in it was more ſtately
than thoſe of <hi>Paris,</hi> and in other Countries. When
he drew near to <hi>Queens</hi>-ſtreet Corner, they had
ſome Diſcourſe, but cannot remember what thoſe
words were at preſent; but he told the Man he
was a Lyer. The Man was a little before him, and
goes over the Kennel, at the end of <hi>Queens</hi>-ſtreet,
as though he would have gone along <hi>Watling</hi>-ſtreet.
My Sonne turns up at the Corner of <hi>Queens</hi>-ſtreet,
and begins to run away from the Man, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
had a great pain took him in the Calves of
his Leggs: So that it forced him to ſtand ſtill:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45186:7"/>
and ſtooping down to feel on his right Legg that
moſt pained him, he looks over his left ſhoulder,
and ſeeing the man gone he was glad he had loſt
his Company, and caſt his Eye on his right Hand,
there the Man was come even with him, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, he was afraid. The Man ſaid, be not
afraid ſo they come up that Street, and croſſed over
to the other ſide of the way, but he kept as it were
a loof off from the Man. But when they drew
near to come into <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> the Man ſtep before
him, and takes him by the Cloak, and ſaith unto
him, be not afraid, do you believe what I have
ſaid unto you. My Sonn anſwered, no, I do not
believe you, nor I will not believe you what you ſay,
Do you not remember that <hi>Zacharias</hi> wear ſtruck
dumb, naming that it was in the firſt Chapter of
<hi>Luke,</hi> my Son ſaith, I do remember there is ſuch a
place, but that was, becauſe he did not believe the
Angel that told him what ſhould come to paſs, and
he ſaid, it may be ſo with you, and he ſaid to the
man, are you an Angel, ſo the man gave him no
anſwer, and broke off that diſcourſe, and came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Cheap-ſide, and when my Son parted from
the man and began to come homewards, he heard
the man ſay, it ſhall be ſo. So my Son turned back
to have called to him, but could not ſpeak, and
ſtood at the corner looking after the man, and
ſaw him turn at the corner the ſame way as
they came together. So the man being out of ſight
he turned now to come home towards his Fathers
houſe. I do verily believe my Sons Heart was full
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45186:7"/>
of ſorrow, and how to declare it he could not then,
ſtill he was troubled that he ſhould anſwer the man
in ſuch a ſcornful and deriding way, and that he
ſhould anſwer him ſo thwartingly. So he came home
to me about five a clock, and I being buiſy in the
ſhop I ſaid nothing to him, but I wondred he came
home ſo ſoon, but he went directly up ſtairs into the
Kitchin, the Maid being there he looks about him,
as though it was ſome ſtrange place unto him, Saith
the Maid to him <hi>Thomas,</hi> methinks you have made
great haſt home; be ſat down by the Table and
ſtruck his hand twice upon it, ſhe ſaith <hi>Thomas,</hi> how
do you do? are you not well? what makes you ſo
heavy? have you had an ill day to day? you did uſe
to ſpeak to us when you came in? what is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with you? now his Siſter hearing the Maid urging
of him to ſpeak, ſhe ſaid to him, brother, will you
not ſpeak to us? I coming into the room ſeeing him
lean on his elbow, bearing is head up with his hand,
I thought he had been weary with his walk. I ſaid
unto him, can you find nothing to do? muſt you ſit
ſtill? go down and help the boy to ſhut up the ſhop,
and as I ſpoke he went down, knowing nothing of
his being dumb: He helped the boy to ſhut up the
ſhop, his ſiſter being there, ſaid to him, brother,
hath any body met with you, and cut out your
tongue? he turning towards her, put forth his tongue,
and made ſigns to the boy with his hand for a pen
and ink. The boy comes up ſtairs to me, and
ſaith, I think <hi>Thomas</hi> hath loſt his tongue, preſently
cometh up again, and ſaith, Maſter, I think <hi>Thomas</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:45186:8"/>
hath loſt his tongue: his ſiſter cometh up alſo, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I think my brother hath loſt his tongue: I
ſat ſtill by the fire, and none of theſe meſſengers did
move me, I thought he was not minded to ſpeak to
them. But the Maid going down of her own accord,
ſaith to him, <hi>Thomas,</hi> why will you not ſpeak to us?
you will make your Father angry, tell us, what is the
matter with you? he was then writing in a piece of
paper, and turns that paper to her, wherein was
writ theſe words; I cannot ſpeak, and ſhaked his
head. Whereat ſhe was much troubled, and coming
up ſaith to me, I fear all is not well with <hi>Thomas:</hi>
Hearing of this it ſtruck me to the heart, then I
went down to him, and laid my hand upon his head,
and ſaid, Child, how doſt thou do? he turnes a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to me, wherein was writ, I cannot ſpeak. I was
greatly amazed, and affrighted: his hand moved to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Heart, he ſhoke his head, his countenance
was exceeding ſad, his tears ran down from his
Eyes: Theſe all gave in their Teſtimonies, that they
were ſorrowing for the ſad Condition that had
befaln him. Methinks, I have the ſight thereof
allwayes in my Eyes, in my thoughts, and on my
Heart, Hand, Head, Countenance and Tears, theſe
all have a loud and ſpeaking voice: And often ſince
he was dumb, it draweth Tears from mine Eyes.
I caſting my Eyes upon his Paper the ſecond time,
I ſaw he had writ underneath thoſe former words,
I cannot ſpeak, ſpeak you and I can underſtand.
So when I ſaw them, I ſaid unto him, Child, give
me an account, where you have been ſince you
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45186:8"/>
went out, and who you have been withal, and he
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hen did give me an account to this Effect, but ſince,
he hath given me a larger account, as the Lord hath
brought thoſe things into his mind. The next day
as I was reading by him in the Afternoon, the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
being open, he caſt his Eyes upon the Sun, very
earneſtly for a time; I thought he might have been
affected with what I was reading off, but he was
only viewing of the Sun as he confeſt afterwards, He
immediately pulleth out his Ink-horne and began to
write, but could not proceed for looking on the
Sun; the Maid obſerving, that his Lipps did move
much, and lifted up his Hands, ſhe beckoned to me
to obſerve him, what he was a doing; I roſe up, to
look in his Face, his Back being towards me, but
turning about I ſaw tears running very faſt from his
Eyes, I took him in my Arms; and ſaid unto him,
be not caſt down, at what time thou art afraid, truſt
in God, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, in the 56. <hi>Pſalm</hi> the Third
Verſe, <hi>I found much comfort in theſe words, who among
you that feareth the Lord and obeyeth the voice of
his Servant, that walketh in darkneſs and hath no light,
let him truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his
God,</hi> in the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>0. of Iſaiah 10. verſe. While my Sonn was
ſtill weeping he Coughed three times, and at the laſt
time ſomething gave a jerk, as though it had been
the breaking of a ſtring, which hurt him a little.
Whereupon, his Tongue was looſed, and he ſpake,
and ſaid, bleſſed be God, I can ſpeak, and then he
told to me what the Man ſaid to him on <hi>London</hi>-Bridge,
That before the Sun be down, that ſhall
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45186:9"/>
be tyed that was never tyed before, and before the
Morrow Sun be down that ſhall be looſe that was
never tyed before. This was remembred by him not
above half an hour before he ſpake. My Sonn faith,
the man ſaid he was a Seaman, he was a man of a middle
Statute, his Clothes under his Coat was of a ſad
colourd Silk watered, a ſad colour Cloath Coat with
Gold Buttons, with a Crevait plain, twice about his
Neck, a Cain in his Hand with a ſilver Head, and
a Sword by his ſide.</p>
               <p>Thus Reader, I have taken care to make good my promiſe
to thee, that I would declare the truth and nothing but
the truth, the Lord give a bleſſing that it might find
warm entertainment in thy heart, as it hath done in mine,
the Lord work it powerfully upon every ſoul in my Family,
for he only bringeth light out of darkneſs, and good out
of evil, as I can experience it at this day, for thou art
a Wonder-working God.</p>
               <p>My Sonn hath ſaid unto me, if he had not been
ſtruck dum, he would never have told me any thing
what this Man had ſaid unto him, but he would have
gone to Sea. But ſince the Lord hath been pleaſed
to give him his ſpeech, he hath ſaid, he will not now
go to Sea, for he hath ſeen the Hand of the Lord
hath been againſt him in a wonderfull manner.</p>
