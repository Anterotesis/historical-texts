         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Second, a rough, rigid, down-right <hi>Juſtice:</hi> One, whoſe hands and eares hold <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy</hi> with <hi>price</hi> and <hi>prayer.</hi> The Third, of a more coole and remiſſe Spirit: yet prompt enough to denounce judgement, where he meetes with an incorrigible Delinquent. Theſe be they that muſt doe the feat.</p>

which makes him infinitely arrogant: yet for all his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, he has purchas'd himſelf no good Opinion; being in no leſſe capacity of Cenſure for cowardize or remiſneſſe by his own Party; then He is by the other part of ingratitude and diſloyalty, The man deſir'd much to become <hi>popular</hi>; which in the end un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did him.

               <p>Now to reſolve thee, why his Look makes this ſetled contract with the Earth; Thou muſt know, he has been ſo baſely baffled, jeer'd, and buffound in every quarter, as he conſorts with no <hi>Society,</hi> where diſgrace do's not meet him; telling Him, how his very <hi>Memory</hi> will be a laſting ſtaine to his <hi>Fame:</hi> a diſhonour to his <hi>Family.</hi> Doe not blame him then, for looking down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: Thou knoweſt well what the Poet ſometimes ſo divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſung;

            <p>Reflect on thy condition, thou Senſuall Libertine!

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi>; whoſe Patriot, Patron and Protector He had profeſt himſelfe to be. But what would all this have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:30774:18"/>
the Cauſe! This might, indeed, have prepar'd way for an Other to <hi>Succeed</hi> him: but not to redreſſe thoſe wrongs done to the <hi>Place</hi> committed to him. Yet, will Some alledge, his <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> was highly conſcious of one <hi>Erour</hi>; which, no doubt, He might ſeaſonably have diverted; by interpoſing himſelfe by way of authoriy, for the indempnity of ſuch <hi>Schollers,</hi> whoſe knowne abilities, ſweet and Docile natures merited not onely approve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but advancement in the opinion of Honour: and whoſe <hi>riſing hopes</hi> might have preſented them Singular <hi>Ornaments</hi> to ſo abſolute a <hi>Mother.</hi> It is anſwered; that his unqueſtioned deſires applied them <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> though not ſo effectually that way, as He did wiſh. For ſuch <hi>Severe Cenſors</hi> were thoſe <hi>Viſitours</hi>; as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>able parts</hi> nor <hi>affable natures</hi> could have any influence upon them. If they appear'd not pliable to their bent, ſutable with their ſtraine; They might neceſſarily incurre Cenſure. The walls of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> were of too ſtrait a Circumference to confine them.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee how groundleſſe aſperſions have beene throwne upon his <hi>Honour</hi> without Cauſe; being deſirous with his moſt ſtudious endeavours to purſue, what His <hi>Countermanded</hi> Power could not effect.</p>
            <p>Shall we now peruſe Him as He was <hi>Courtier,</hi> or imployed in <hi>affaires</hi> of <hi>State</hi>? It was ſometimes obſerv'd by a Wiſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd Hiſtorian; that there were three <hi>Objects,</hi> of all Others, moſt fatally dangerous to a qualified Courtier. Ambition; Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice; and Recede from imployment. Let us examine theſe in Him.</p>
            <p>Ambitious He was never; for his deſires were ever impaled within the freedome of their owne juſt limits. His higheſt <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition</hi> was how to preferre the juſt Suite of an injuried Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, and to expedite it without Charge to the Preferrer. To be eminent in the eye of a Prince; and make uſe of his royall favour in ſo pious an Office is a glorious Ambition. Beſides, he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obſerv'd to carry a Supercilious Look: nor reteine a Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of acceſſe. Bearing a cheerfull pleaſant aſpect to all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers and Suiters, without an imperious Diſ-reliſhing frowne; which was ſuch a Stranger to his Countenance; as there was nothing He held at more diſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:30774:19"/>For <hi>Avarice</hi>; there is none that truly knows Him, but will witneſſe for Him, that it was never in requeſt with Him; nor admitted to take acquaintance of Him.</p>
            <p>He was never mercenary in the ampleſt favours He ſhew'd to any. So as, though there have been ever many both <hi>Juſticiaries</hi> and <hi>Courtiers</hi> who might be aptly reſembled to the <hi>Celidonie Stone,</hi> that loſeth it's virtue and vigour, when it ceaſeth to be touch't with <hi>Gold</hi>; His Honor was not of that humour. Wealth was one of his loweſt and contemtibleſt Objects. His Revenues, indeed, were great; which might have ſtored his coffers with an affluence of treaſure: but his deſires were never confined to thoſe ends. His bounty every where returned Him this teſtimony.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Recede from imployment</hi>; it was a thing, which of all other, He moſt hated. He was, you will ſay, a <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>pleaſure.</hi> He was, indeed, much addicted to Exerciſe and Recreation; wherein He would uſually be very Sociably merry. Some ſlight perfunctory Paſſion might, perchance, ſometimes overtake Him; but it was quickly overcome by Him. In all theſe Recreations and Delights, a pleaſing familiarity accompanied Him; which in all Places procured him loue: Being nothing like Some of our <hi>Surly Lords</hi>; who hold familiarity in ſuch contempt; as they become contemptible to their familiars.</p>
            <p>Some infirmities, I muſt confeſſe, He has; as every One has Some: and He the beſt who is Subject to the leaſt. And of Theſe He repents Him. Neither is He at any time incenſed at Such as friendly admoniſh Him of them: but with all affability thank them. Habits, indeed, in Vice, are ſooner <hi>got</hi> then <hi>forgone.</hi> But his deſire to be reclaim'd from them, argues his hate to them: with his reſolution wholy to decline them.</p>
            <p>His ſmall acquaintance and familiarity with <hi>Books,</hi> ſhould not <hi>muſter</hi> Such <hi>Invectives</hi> againſt his Perſon: though <hi>Learning</hi> be the exquiſiteſt beauty, that can imbelliſh <hi>Honour</hi>; yet it directs not alwaies a <hi>line</hi> to that <hi>Centre.</hi> There be more Havens to arrive at then <hi>Corynth.</hi> To be a <hi>Protector</hi> of Learning, though no <hi>Profeſſor,</hi> is praiſe-worthy in Honour.</p>
            <p>Now, to conclude this <hi>Apology</hi>; whereas, much might be here Objected againſt Him touching his <hi>Compliance</hi> with theſe times; what that Great Favourite ſpake ſomtimes to ingenious <hi>Pibrack</hi>;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:30774:19"/>
may be return'd in his behalfe: <hi>Honours and Revenues be ſtrong pullies to frailty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I am confident, his <hi>Honour</hi> reteines in Him thoughts of Loyalty: and will be ready to manifeſt them to the world with all reality.</p>
            <p>You then, who uſually walk in Shades of <hi>Worm-wood,</hi> ceaſe from dipping your Pens in the leaſt tincture of <hi>Gall,</hi> that may any way tend to the impeachment of <hi>Honour.</hi> There be other Subjects fitter for Loyally-affected Subjects. Let your Pens be ſo employed, that <hi>Goodneſſe</hi> may be rather incouraged; then the leaſt hopes of proficiency in actions of Honour retarded.</p>
            <p>For his Secretary <hi>Michael Olds worth,</hi> Eſquire, (ſo nearly ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolizing both in name and nature with that Eminent confined <hi>Divine</hi>) as His <hi>abilites</hi> are well known: ſo is his integrity no leſſe approv'd.</p>
            <p>He ſhoots ſhafts at the Moon, (as one no leſſe worthily then Morally obſerveth) who out of a Malignant humour, makes it his labour to darken the ſplendour of <hi>Goodneſſe</hi> and <hi>Honour.</hi>

Meane time, what <hi>Hyperbolees</hi> muſt theſe <hi>ſoyles</hi> of <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>Staines</hi> to <hi>Juſtice</hi> have beſtowed on them; to make the <hi>face</hi> of TREASON look with the clearer Count'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance?</p>
            <p>For to deſcend to thy <hi>Criticall Catalogue</hi>: (for I proteſt, thou deſerveſt well to be pillored by the <hi>Parliament Party,</hi> for abuſing thoſe <hi>State-ſhadowes</hi>: and beſtowing on their immeriting perſons, ſuch undeſerving praiſes:) So as inſtead of the <hi>Clawing Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,</hi> thou acteſt the part of a <hi>Saucy Critick</hi>; in praiſing thoſe whom all the world condemns: and for thoſe <hi>pretended virtues,</hi> which their <hi>tainted breaſts</hi> never harbour'd.

               <note place="margin">☜</note> or the <hi>Party praiſed</hi> wants <hi>merit.</hi> Neither is it leſſe <hi>Criticiſme,</hi> to praiſe where either the <hi>Object</hi> or <hi>Subject</hi> admits no praiſe.</p>
            <p>Thus with a palpable cheating Ignorance, thou committeſt a double Offence: Firſt, in deluding theſe <hi>Authenticall Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors</hi>: in making them believe (if thy <hi>flattery</hi> could make them ſo credulous, or confidently opinionate, as to hug their <hi>folly</hi>) that all this <hi>long track</hi> of <hi>diſloyalty,</hi> wherein they have ſo aſſiduately ſtalked and trampled on the face of honour, was a <hi>path</hi> of <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique conveniency</hi>; leading to the ſafety, ſecurity, and liberty of the Subject: and no diſturbance to a civill peace; their <hi>Principles</hi> tending to no other <hi>end,</hi> nor their <hi>Deſignes</hi> aiming at any other <hi>Object,</hi> then <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>Church</hi> by introducing a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Government: and <hi>redreſſe</hi> of abuſes coincident to the <hi>State,</hi> by coercion of Their power, who might otherwiſe extend Their power by a Priviledge of Soveraignty, and convert their Commands into a Tyranny.</p>
            <p>This (my <hi>poore Rooke</hi>) were a plauſive palliating way, if thy ſhallow braines could either preſſe it: or integrity of judgment prove it. But leaſt one wedge drive out another, I muſt have a touch (my <hi>paltry Paraſite</hi>) at thy next error: Wherein thou

deſireſt (but ſhallow-grounded deſires ever produce groundleſſe effects) to delude the People: whoſe judgments, were they as purblind as thine owne, thou wouldſt make them believe, that whatſoever that <hi>Perenniall Conſiſtory</hi> of <hi>State</hi> has already orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or ſhall hereafter order, conduceth principally to Their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement; and the Kingdomes honour: That there is no <hi>error,</hi> nor any <hi>Symptom</hi> of a <hi>corrupt Member,</hi> in that grave and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Senat-houſe.

Telling them plainly (for his <hi>Education</hi> from a <hi>pad-ſtaffe,</hi> could not promiſe much Oratory) that as there was no <hi>Smith</hi> in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo it ſtood with the conveniency of a State to have no King in <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> And that He would prove by good authority, that in their firſt <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> they were accounted as <hi>Ordinary men,</hi> both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their <hi>Antiquity, Dignity,</hi> and <hi>Quality.</hi> For ſaid He, what great <hi>Antiquity</hi> can they preſcribe from <hi>Adam?</hi> Do we read that either <hi>Adam</hi> was a King: or his Conſort <hi>Eve</hi> a <hi>Queene? Digging</hi> and <hi>Delving</hi> was no proper office for a <hi>King:</hi> neither <hi>Spinning</hi> nor <hi>Weaving</hi> for a <hi>Queene.</hi> Yet was this Manufactory and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall Labour the onely imployment of that abſolute Emperour and his Empereſſe. But admit (what is not to be admitted) that this <hi>Onely Man</hi> on Earth enjoy'd the Style of <hi>King</hi>; yet all the World will confeſſe, that He had no great aſſurance of his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> when the <hi>taſte</hi> of an <hi>Aple</hi> drove him out of his <hi>Dominion.</hi> Beſides, was <hi>She</hi> worthy to reteine the Style of a <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> who was deceived ſo eaſily by a <hi>Serpent?</hi> Or He worthy to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his Commands over men, who was ſo quickly ſeduced by a <hi>Woman?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the Second point; if you account him ſo eminent in reſpect of his <hi>Dignity</hi>; you are wholly miſtaken (quoth He) there is no ſuch mattter. For look upon the manner of their Election; and you will finde in it no ſuch inducement of titular

honour. For was not <hi>Darius</hi> that great Perſian King; One who would have valued <hi>Great Britanny</hi> but as a <hi>Molehill</hi>; choſen King from <hi>Neighing</hi> of his <hi>Horſe:</hi> and I pray you, did not the Groome of his Stable deſerve that Title as well, if not better then He; when his device was the onely Meanes for his Maſter to win the prize? Was not <hi>Gordian</hi> likewiſe choſen Prince from the <hi>Plowſhare</hi>? And <hi>Probus</hi> taken from Setting of a <hi>Turnop</hi> in his <hi>Garden</hi> to be made <hi>Guardian</hi> over a flouriſhing State? Would not theſe prove brave <hi>compleat Courtiers,</hi> when the One was bred a <hi>Gardner</hi>; the Other a <hi>Curter?</hi> O dainty perfumed Emperours! With what beſeeming State could <hi>Hobnaile</hi> put on a <hi>Royall Roabe</hi>? Or a <hi>Turnop-ſetter,</hi> whoſe onely triumphant Cry was to improve the Sale of his <hi>Carrets,</hi> mount to a <hi>Chaire</hi> of <hi>State</hi>?</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee, ſaid He, <hi>Majeſty</hi> clouted up in a <hi>Plow ſhare:</hi> and diſht up in a <hi>Sallet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the laſt, which is his <hi>Quality.</hi> Have not the <hi>Greateſt Kings</hi> been the worſt men? Looke upon that brutiſh <hi>Nebuchado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nozer</hi>; and you ſhall finde him grazing amongſt beaſts of the field: and he the very worſt Beaſt of all the Herd. Look upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi>; and you ſhall finde Him acting bloudy <hi>Nimrods</hi> part, hunting cruelly and craftily after the Children of God. Go to <hi>Herod,</hi> and you ſhall heare Him exalting himſelfe above God. Rich <hi>Ahab</hi> muſt have poore <hi>Naboths</hi> Vinyeard, though he have many of his Owne. <hi>Naboth</hi> muſt be ſton'd, to inlarge his State. Thus many Kings have wholy <hi>unking'd</hi> themſelves, by ſtriving to make themſelves too abſolute Kings. By incroaching upon their Subjects, they have become lower then their Subjects. Baſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolies, High Impoſitions, heavy Impoſts, burthenſome Taxes, have made Peeres, Commons, Merchants, Perſons of all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to become weary of their Yoake: and caſt off Loyalty, to redeem their Liberty.</p>
            <p>Thoſe <hi>Syracuſan Tyrants</hi> made fetters for themſelves. Their owne actions begot them factions. They needed no greater Enemies then them ſelves to depoſe them. <hi>Phalaris</hi> that cruell Tyrant cauſed his cunning Enginiere <hi>Perillus</hi> to make him a Bull (nearly reſembling our late <hi>Colcheſter Bull</hi>) purpoſely to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Thoſe, whom He hated: but <hi>Perillus</hi> was the very firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient that was tormented in it.

Yet we muſt not believe this, your hearts were ever harmoniouſly united to us. Both in judgment and affection you were wholly Aliens to any ſuch Invaſion. And if we may have ſo much faith as to believe you; there is nothing that may hold conſiſtence with our ſafety, which you do not equally ballance as your own ſecurity.

During your march, all were huſht: much expected from the ſucceſſe of your invaſion: no acknowledgement then intended: nor tender of ſubmiſſion. Did you then think (unboſome your ſelves freely, and for once caſhere hypocriſy) to call for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; but rather to expoſe our States for fuell to your fury? Did not the confidence of an approching conqueſt tranſport you;

nay, wholly eſtrange your affection: and make you forgetfull of our tranſacted union? Had your large-ſpreading Army marched on with ſucceſſe, and proved as victorious as it was numerous; ſhould we have received from your imperious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands this peacefull meſſage? would your <hi>white banner</hi> have been then diſplaied? No, Sir; ſuch faire dealing could not be expected from your hands. It is not to be doubted, but your Nation knows better to make <hi>uſe</hi> of a <hi>victory,</hi> then how to <hi>get</hi> it. You who profeſſe your ſelves now (if we were ſo foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly credulous as to believe you) our indeared friends; would have appeared then our implacable foes. A puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Enemy admits no quarter. You and the inhumane Iriſh hold concurrency in this: you cannot be ſecure from fear, till you can play at football with the Head of your foe. But De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence timely deluded your expected ſucceſſe. For what gained you by your confuſed march, but <hi>reproch</hi> and <hi>hate?</hi> Thoſe Northern Parts, through which you ranged and ravaged, had good cauſe to conjecture, that you came rather to <hi>plunder</hi> then <hi>conquer. Mun-Ro</hi> (a man as ignorant in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of Armes as civil carriage, being in the one artleſſe, the other ſavage) became a true ſtake to our new-eſtabliſhed State; when his brutiſh and intollerable uſage made thoſe who ſhould have been his <hi>Aſſiſtants,</hi> his <hi>Aſſaſſins</hi>: our pretented foes, our converted friends. This courteſie did that <hi>uncivil Bore</hi> do us, though againſt his will. Such infinite diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage befalls an undiſciplined Commander by ruining his own: and inhancing his rifling fortunes with injurious booties. But we muſt be friends, (ſo you ſay;) Theſe invaſions muſt not diſſolve nor diſ-joynt our affections. A Nationall union has joyned us together: which no fomenters of diviſion ſhould diſſever. Hate is not to be ingendred upon every light heat.</p>
            <p>Fall from that accompt, good <hi>Chancelor</hi>; hoſtile invaſions are not ſo to be minſed. Though remiſneſſe of Spirit in the purſuit of your deſign, cauſed you to faint in your fight; the impoveriſhed North groaned under the inſupportable burden of your inſolence: finding no <hi>Salve</hi> to cure their <hi>Sore</hi> but a coactive patience.

Is it not an <hi>Aſſeſſe,</hi> rather then a <hi>Benevolence?</hi> Our morall Philoſophers, who knew beſt how to define true Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality; will informe your knowledge ſufficiently in this point. Theſe will tell you, that a <hi>coacted Bounty</hi> is a <hi>palliated Parci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</hi> What a ſtronger hand then your own will not ſuffer you to enjoy, that you ſeem willing to forgo; but our Nation, to whoſe favour you thus inſinuate, expects a more ſatisfactory Oblation. In your late aſſiſtance, which merits not the ſtyle but ſhadow of an <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> your <hi>valour</hi> was oft ingaged and brought to ſtake, but never came off with honour. Some indeed of your Country-carcaſes lay ſcattered under the walls at <hi>Hereford.</hi> Whoſe Deaths gave greater teſtimonies of their valour then their Lives: being onely uſed as <hi>dead Marks</hi> to ſhoot at, without reſiſtance. You were ſtill rather upon the <hi>taking</hi> then <hi>fighting</hi> hand. The eſtates and livelyhoods of our diſtreſſed Country exhauſted by the fury of civill warrs and domeſtick hoſtility, became your injurious merchandize and extorted booty. Which you on your foundred Sumpters daily exported to your ſordid and disfurniſhed Lithſtows, without ever doing any action of importance in our ſervice. Though we have heard one of your Country Commanders, after your
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:30774:32"/>
native facetious way, anſwer a qualified Souldier of ours, twitting him in ſaying: <hi>All their valour conſiſted in number. O,</hi> replied he, <hi>if we be ſo terrible in the apparence of our number, what ſhall we be, when we diſcover our valour</hi>? But the Cure had been worſe then the Diſeaſe, if our late and long diſpute had continued, till your perſonall proweſſe had determined it. Your old <hi>Generall,</hi> now a <hi>Blind Guide,</hi> and deſerted of his own; after his <hi>Sweden</hi> fame, amply gratified by his penſion in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merania,</hi> eclipſed much of his glory, in his too much ſpeed at <hi>Hayſham Moor</hi>; where he was better known to his <hi>feare</hi> then unexpected <hi>fortune</hi>: making his iſſue with ſuch winged ſpeed through his Army, as it would not ſuffer him to ſtay the time of being a wittneſſe to the iſſue or cloſe of the victory. Yet in this Conqueſt atchieved by <hi>our hands,</hi> it was wonderfull to obſerve, how your frontleſſe <hi>puſillanimity</hi> could put upon it the countenance of Sovereignty! For how often have we been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed of your unſufferable boldneſs in dating your uſurping Letters, from our Towns of <hi>Northallerton, Thirske,</hi> and <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> with other places of confluence in our Northern parts: as if you had wholly ſubdued theſe to inlarge the boundiers and revenues of your penurious State, without relation to our benefit, but highly to the derogation of our honour.</p>
            <p>And in theſe your braving and inſupportable inſolencies, we for beare to recount thoſe inhumane cruelties perpetrated by you; in the view whereof even the blood of Savages would curdle: and reſolve hearts wholly compoſed of marble into teares; being writ in characters, of ſo deep a dy, as no revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of time can raze them. Sad ſpectacles! To ſee aged perſons, who had one foot in the Grave, and whoſe mellow and mature yeares might have begot in your inhumane aſſaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats a venerable awe and reverence, imbathed and imbrued in their own blood; for labouring with their decayed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crep it ſtrength to preſerve the conjugall honour of their infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Daughters. Rapes, rapine and murther frequently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and with impunity tranſmitted!</p>
            <p>But our Brotherhood, pretended alliance and aſſociation might ſeem to apply <hi>Salves</hi> to theſe <hi>Sores</hi>; we never called
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:30774:32"/>
you to account for them: the more is our account.</p>
            <p>But to omit theſe; for long ſince were they cancelled out of your memory; like a <hi>Stage-tragedy,</hi> no ſooner preſented, and the Curtain drawn, then with an act of Oblivion cloſed; your deſire holds ſtill to be at one with us; though there be no union among your ſelves. Which makes us partly believe that you are lineally deſcended from ſome of thoſe ancient <hi>Britaines,</hi> (as your Nation pretends) who whenſoever they were ingaged or indangered by their invaſive Enemy, fled for refuge to the <hi>Romans</hi>; not ſo much for any expreſſe of loyalty, as for their own ſecurity. In a word, if you mean to ſhake hands with us; you muſt firſt ſhake off your old haire. <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened walls</hi> and <hi>painted Sepulchers</hi> are more ſuitable Emblems for your <hi>Presbyterian.</hi> Principles, then for the late <hi>Instauration</hi> of our <hi>Democraticall Government.</hi> Your inconſiſtency to Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of <hi>peace</hi>; and inconcurrency to <hi>truth,</hi> have made us your Aliens: though we dare truſt you, ſo long as you be <hi>Viſible Objects</hi>; in our ſight, but no further.</p>
            <p>We ſhall be content to accompt you <hi>Subjects:</hi> but by a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate union, to draw in one yoake with you, were to advance you to an immerited liberty: and by that meanes bring us to incurre an imperious ſlavery: Nay, by our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to enable an Enemy; who now wants ſinewes to act his fury. This might detract more from our diſcretion, then the fame which the continued ſucceſſe of our actions has won us, would in an <hi>Iliad</hi> of ages repaire.</p>
            <p>SIR, you may ſpare your pen, where there is no probability to prevaile. Onely let us tell you: That your conquered Nation may hold it for a <hi>Trophie</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi>; when an <hi>Engliſh Victor</hi> injoyns you to ſuffer.</p>

            <head>A FUNERALL ORATION; as it was delivered at DARBY-HOUSE:
<date>The 6. of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1648.</date>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ehold my Beloved! We are come hither to an Houſe of Mourning! And we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in it; for it is better to come to the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Mourning</hi> then <hi>Rejoycing.</hi> Surely the mournfull condition of this late-Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſed Houſe muſt needs confirm it. O vanity of vanities! <hi>DARBY-HOUSE</hi> diſſolved! That <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bona!</hi> that <hi>Tagus!</hi> that <hi>Pactolus!</hi> nay, that <hi>Indian Inne</hi> of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bion</hi> blown up in a moment! Wo is me for thee, thou head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Capitol!</p>
            <p>But in the recollection of our ſorrowes, it will become me, whom <hi>Authority</hi> hath injoyned to this <hi>ſad Task,</hi> to reduce theſe <hi>Iliads</hi> of griefes into <hi>Order,</hi> which mount to that height, as they will neither admit of meaſure nor number: unleſſe with thoſe, who have ſuffered ſo much by them, as they can forbear to ſuffer with them: or ſacrifice one poor teare of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous compaſſion for them.</p>
            <p>Give me leave then to preſent this late <hi>Grand Modell</hi> or <hi>Master-piece</hi> of <hi>State</hi> in the form of a Naked Body, but no Breathing Feature: Onely a vapour; an indigeſted Bulke without Symmetriall Contexture, or Organicall Proportion: a veſſell of duſt; a Pile of diſſolution. Draw near then, ye ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Spectators, and in this grave, but now Grave-approching <hi>Patriot,</hi> whom we here perſonally preſent: Behold a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle of Mortality; a Preſident of Mutability! See how the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:30774:33"/>
               <hi>Gold</hi> has loſt his <hi>Colour</hi>; how this deceaſed <hi>Party,</hi> that lies here before you, has loſt both <hi>fame</hi> and <hi>honour!</hi> How clear a <hi>yesterday</hi> lookt upon it: and with what a lowring brow does <hi>this day</hi> welcome it? It cannot be leſſe then well known to you, <hi>Judicious Auditors</hi>; how ſingularly this Mournfull Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall was indowed: with what abilities compleated; being the onely ſelect one cull'd from <hi>Apollo's Senat,</hi> to beget a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh and awfull reverence in his retainers.</p>
            <p>Shall we diſſect him, and eye his Materialls? Wipe your eyes firſt, that ſuch a ſenſe-ſeazing <hi>Sceleton</hi> turn you not all to <hi>Niobees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Philoſophy tells you, that Man conſiſts of three parts: and beſtows his faculties wholly upon them. The <hi>Iraſcible, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcible</hi> and <hi>Intelligible.</hi> Now ſurvey the late abilities of this <hi>Breathleſle Object</hi> in every of theſe: and the apprehenſion of them will leave you in aſtoniſhment.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Iraſcible</hi>; he ſcorned to recall to mind that leſſon which that abſolute Philoſopher left with his Emperour:
<q>To repeat the four and twenty Greek Letters in his anger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he proceeded to any cenſure.</q>
Or to follow the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Archytas</hi>;
<q>Who would not correct his hind, becauſe he was <hi>angry</hi> with him.</q>
No; this <hi>brave Spirit</hi> was more ſenſible of a wrong: and more ſpeedy in his revenge. He would ſtrike while the Iron was hot: He was but a word and a blow.</p>
            <p>He held it a diſhonour to him, to expoſtulate the cauſe with a ſuppoſed Malignant: Report was ſufficient to make him <hi>one,</hi> without further evidence to evince him.</p>
            <p>Believe it, my Beloved, ſo ſtrong was this grave Segniour in paſſion; ſo free in his exhibition: as he with the reſt of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>Rhadamanths,</hi> have ſent more <hi>Preſents</hi> from hence to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter houſe,</hi> in one day: then they did in Almes or <hi>Peter-pence</hi> all their time. It has been obſerved, that the onely <hi>Aire</hi> which this reverend Cenſor uſed to breath, was—<hi>Secure him, Secure him.</hi> Which was ever done to purpoſe: for thoſe that went in, found the Lions Cave to be there: —<hi>veſtigia nulla re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trorſum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have many times heard Him maintain it (to the gall<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

of his Spirit be it ſpoken) that it was one of his Ambitions to learn perfectly the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Memory</hi>; to the end he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a <hi>ſenſe</hi> of his <hi>Injuries</hi> the better.<note place="margin">The ſole ends of a politick Statiſt.</note> And that it was never his deſire to be imployed in behalfe of the <hi>Publick,</hi> but for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ends and ſecret revenge. Which could never be more nimbly effected, nor colourably purſued, then while our <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> were <hi>troubled</hi>: and our <hi>State diſtracted.</hi> He alwaies held it convenient in his object of revenge, to begin with the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar</hi> firſt. <hi>Eagles</hi> catch no <hi>Flies.</hi> This he confeſſed a few daies before he departed this life, to be be his <hi>Master-piece</hi> in the diſpatch of <hi>STRAFFORD</hi>:<note place="margin">Timely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention is the life of policy: and in this Preſident the ruine of a Monarchy.</note> whom, if by the ſingular indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and dexterity of his <hi>Nimble Didappers,</hi> whom he imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as <hi>Active Instruments</hi> for that deſign; he had not timely lopped; the aimes of his <hi>Senat</hi> had not been onely prevented; and their main project diverted: But he with all ſuch as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heared to him, had been catcht in <hi>STRAFFORDS</hi> Gyn: and foold themſelves, before ever they had brought him to the Bay.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Eucopius</hi> drawing near his Bed-ſide a very ſmall time before his death; ſeriouſly demanded of him, what his reaſon might be, under ſuch faire plauſive pretences ſo to imbroile a peaceful State: and inſtead of plenty, peace and proſperity, by his ſeditious complices, to bring in ſcarcity, ruine and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery into this Kingdom? His anſwer was; As <hi>all Creatures</hi> feed not on <hi>clean meats:</hi> Nor <hi>all Fiſhes</hi> delight in <hi>Clear wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>: So neither did it agree with <hi>all humours</hi> to hold peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able times their onely Jubilees. Peace, I confeſſe (ſaid he) may be highly conducing to the benefit of ſuch <hi>Merchants</hi>; whoſe improvement draws its life and ſpirit from Traffick: As all other Artiſts by Manufactory or other Myſteries: but Some we have who <hi>Margites</hi>—like can neither digge, delve, nor raiſe them a ſubſiſtence by any legall or peacefull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour: and muſt theſe Lobſters periſh? No; Some are naturally bred for <hi>Arts</hi>; Some for <hi>Arms. Arts</hi> had their proper vocations before; Let <hi>Arms</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their place now. Thoſe that know neither how to <hi>beg</hi> nor <hi>work</hi>; by an eſpeciall Committee of Examinats, we have given them free ſcope to take that courſe as may inforce ſuch as cannot <hi>work,</hi> to <hi>beg</hi> reliefe from their hands, who make it

their vocation to practiſe plunder: and in the purſuit of it,<note place="margin">An excellent proviſion for lame Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: and ſturdy Beggers.</note> accompt it their abſolute honour.</p>
            <p>During the time of his <hi>viſitation</hi>; which was not very long: for he was taken with ſuch a violent peſtilentiall <hi>Fever,</hi> as through want of ſleep with other occaſionall diſtempers ariſing from the intemperate heat of his brain, He became diverſe times wonderfully diſtracted, and in the end mortally ſurpriſed; yet in his <hi>Intervalls,</hi> he was one evening by a ſerious and grave Royalliſt, who in regard of his near relation to him, oftentimes viſited him, asked theſe three queſtions.</p>
            <p>The firſt, how he with the reſt of his prudent and reverend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Synod, could digeſt ſuch an apparent affront, as to endure ſome of their <hi>principall Members</hi> to be ſo injuriouſly rent and pulled from them; as if the whole Power or Prerogative of their Houſe were to render up their ancient pretended Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges to the power of the Sword?</p>
            <p>O, ſaid he; heave but my head a little higher upon my Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and I ſhall anſwer you. Theſe whom you call <hi>principall Members</hi>; were permitted to be removed from us, not to prejudice us, but improve us. They were known to be ſtrong <hi>presbyteriall</hi> Opinioniſts; ſuch, as held an Article of Faith to ſtand to their <hi>firſt Principles</hi>: which, as we rightly apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would prove inconſiſtent to our <hi>Priviledges.</hi> We might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a <hi>stronger Party</hi> interpoſing. Though we had many votes in the Houſe: yet the <hi>Army</hi> had ever the <hi>caſting Voice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For my part, my Conſcience was not ſo ſtraitly laced, nor moſt of my <hi>zealous Brethren</hi> neither (though the Army dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide us, nay defide us, and in our <hi>Connivence</hi> ſlight us) but we could give way to Power: and diſpence with our own <hi>Tenets</hi> to procure our ſelves peace: ſo cautious were we of preſerving the propriety of our eſtate, and priority of our place.</p>
            <p>But whence was it, replyed this <hi>Viſitant</hi>; that after you had given them this repulſe, you ſhould vote them ſo grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a returne?</p>
            <p>O, ſaid this deceaſed Senatour;<note place="margin">A rare Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Receipt; whoſe ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences conſiſt more of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy then piety.</note> this was not intended to cheriſh but to chaſtiſe them. In our receiving them, we reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them for Sacrifices to the Army; to practiſe on them what pleaſed them beſt, whether it were cruelty or mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:30774:35"/>Our onely policy was to approve acts of Hoſtility: being done by the ſtronger Party.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> You plaid your Cards wiſely (ſaid the Viſitant:) but I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how your <hi>Wiſdoms</hi> will be able to anſwer thoſe main and many Objections preſſed againſt you, by that great diſcomfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and now captivated Duke, touching your late invitation of him and his numerous fugitive forces in this Kingdom!</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">That Tiberian Duke, inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop't his Counſells in a cloud, till his cloudy deſigns clothed with Ambition, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to the Block.</note>Nothing more eaſily, replyed this our departed Brother; may not we with as much confidence avouch that ſome of our grave well-monied Cittizens were their onely inviters; and that for our ſelves, we were never ſo much as made acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their deſignes till the Duke with his Army was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated; may not we, I ſay, with as much boldneſſe and as little truth, maintain this; as <hi>Monſieur Loudon</hi> their reverend Chancelour, in the repreſentative Body of his credible Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, proteſted, purpoſely to ingratiate them with our awefull Senate: and by this pretenſive defence of their ſuſpected inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, to reunite them to their amity and correſpondence?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Yet, methinks, ſaid this Viſitant, you might have labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo far as to have ſalved the wounded honour and reputation of your <hi>City</hi>; whoſe frequent conſiderable recruits ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded highly to the advantage of the <hi>Publick:</hi> by your joynt votes and voices to have oppoſed the <hi>Armies quartering</hi> with them: at leaſt from ſuffering them to be their own Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters with the Cities treaſury: or diſhonouring D. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> ſo much,<note place="margin">Chaſte <hi>Diana's</hi> ancient Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Augea's</hi> Stable, <hi>Laver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> Staple.</note> as to make him now in his old dayes the Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of an Ordinary: or Commiſſary to a three penny Hoſtry; a Turn-ſpit to the Souldry: or to reduce <hi>Pauls</hi> Sanctuary to a pilfring Scullery.</p>
            <p>So might we, replyed this bemoaned Party, have brought an old houſe over our eares. The tongue is but a weak Engine againſt force. Whom had we to ſide with us for our ſecurity, if our indiſcreet votes ſhould have oppoſed the Army? you muſt know, Sir, it fares with us as with a ſplitted <hi>Ship,</hi> or a ruinous Pile: when the Houſe falls to decay, the Rats run away.</p>
            <p>Beſides, our juſt revenge upon thoſe <hi>white-liver'd Citizens,</hi> (who, ſo they may ſit quietly to hatch their own eggs, care
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:30774:35"/>
not much though other neſts be rifled) Or as in a thunder; where every one prayes the thunderbolt may not fall upon his own houſe, and very little regards the danger of his neighbour. So a ſprig of <hi>Lawrell</hi> may ſecure him; he reſts ſecure of others ruine.</p>
            <p>For their <hi>daring Petitions</hi> ſo often preſented to us; but with ſuch <hi>eaſie thanks</hi> ſlighted by us: that, albeit we commended their care and zeal for the publick peace, yet we carried ſtill a <hi>Stone</hi> in our <hi>Boſom,</hi> which we intended to throw whenſoever opportunity ſhould give way. That Spirit ſuits not well with the conſtitution of this time; that entertains re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, where he may incounter his foe with a ſuitable revenge.</p>
            <p>Thus far have we preſented to you in this Spectacle of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, how this breathleſſe relique of State, ſtood affected touching the <hi>Iraſcible Part</hi>: will you heare his own confeſſion for the <hi>Concupiſcible?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He acknowledged freely in the preſence of ſundry eminent perſons; but never till our Phyſitians had given him over: that ſince the very firſt time that he was made a <hi>M.</hi> of the <hi>Houſe</hi>; he found his mind much diſtempered with an <hi>Hydroptick humour.</hi> The more he got; the more he ſought. His <hi>thirſt</hi> was never to be quenched, no, though his ſteeming <hi>Lungs</hi> were the <hi>Spunges</hi> of the <hi>State</hi>; &amp; ſhared ſufficiently with the <hi>Committee</hi> of every <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> yet were all theſe <hi>In-comes</hi> but empty Purveiers to my hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry deſires. For though my Neſt were freely feathered at home: my Hutch richly ſtored abrode: I was ever angling after the fat fortunes of ſome pretended <hi>Malignant</hi>: hugging that <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiall Ordinance,</hi> by vertue whereof a <hi>cram'd Eſtate</hi> impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a <hi>Committee</hi> to make a <hi>Delinquent.</hi> Hence it was, that being fortified by <hi>Councel</hi> at <hi>home,</hi> and <hi>Forces abroade</hi>: we found it an eaſie matter to make <hi>Loyalty</hi> a <hi>Crime</hi>: and vote all ſuch as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to their <hi>P.</hi> by a Legiſlative Power, <hi>Egregious Traitors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to the third; if you who be here preſent, and ſee me drawing near the <hi>ſhore,</hi> deſire to know how I ſince my firſt calling up to be a <hi>Senatour,</hi> imployed my <hi>Intelligible Part: WALSINGAM</hi> in his time was never more ſollicitous after <hi>Intelligence.</hi> I underſtood well how <hi>France</hi> begun to follow our foot-ſtepps: Soveraignty became unto them an inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable yoak of ſlavery. The Turkiſh Commonty:

Eſpecially with the mutinous Janizary, with whom ever ſince theſe <hi>State-diſtractions,</hi> we have kept a firme and conſtant correſpondency. (for we had the knack of fingering the ſtrings of <hi>Infidels</hi> for the better tuning of our own <hi>Inſtruments</hi>) appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and applauded our ſuper-regulating and regulizing Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>This infinitely joyed me: not doubting, but within ſhort time (at leaſt in their next Turkiſh Jubilee) to be enrowled <hi>Saintly Muſilmen,</hi> in their <hi>Alcoran.</hi>
