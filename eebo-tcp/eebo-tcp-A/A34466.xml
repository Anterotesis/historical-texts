            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44768:3"/>
there for an officer to convay me to Prince <hi>Robert,</hi> and I told them I had a meſſage to deliver to him from his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, of which thoſe kinde of people not taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, I went further into the Towne, and called to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman deſiring him I might bee brought to the place where the Prince was, which the Gentleman (who I after found was the Lord <hi>Caff)</hi> directed me to, upon my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach thither, I alighted with the Trumpot, and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſpeake with the Prince, but before I could be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, I was by Commiſſary <hi>Wilmot</hi> conveyed to his owne chamber and being, asked if I had letters, I repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I had, and told him to whom, and upon what occaſion the letters he willed me to deliver to him, and tartly ſayd he muſt have thoſe I had, whereupon I delivered the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to him which was ſealed, he then left me in the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of an officer or two, who uſed me fairely, and ſtayed with me in the chamber till his returne, which was ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and then tooke me with him ro the Prince, to whom in preſence of Generall <hi>Ruthen,</hi> and Commiſſary <hi>Wilmot,</hi> I declared the meſſage I had in charge, to which his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe gave a faire anſwere, but withall told me I was by the law of Armes a priſoner, for that I came into the town without leave procured by a Trumpet, and brought letters through the Army which was ſealed: I told his Highneſſe, ſor the firſt, I conceived I had not broken the law of Armes, for that the Trumpet ſounded thrice, there was no court of guard, or other watch kept about the towne, neither would any take cogniſance of my buſines with the Prince, (though I intreated it of divers) till I was in the towne, which gave me cauſe to believe his Highnes was not there: For the ſecond it was buſineſſe from the Parliament, therefore not unfit to be ſealed, the rather for that the like courſe had within few daies been held before
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44768:3"/>
in the very ſame buſineſſe, and it found acceptation which preſidented rhis; the anſwere not ſatisfying under the name of an officer to keepe me company, I was returned to Commiſſary <hi>Wilmots</hi> chamber, where I was entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with convenient reſpect, though no way ſutable to the buſineſſe of that day: the Trumpet was put into a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber cloſe by, and there they indeavoured to ſeduce him from his ſervice, to become a Trumpet to the King, from about eleven a clock in the forenoone, till one next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning I was kept in the chamber, a ſtrong court of Guard being ſet at the ſtreete doore of the houſe where I lay, there came ſeverall officers to me, and tooke liberty to ſpeake of his Excellence, moſt of the Lords here, and both Houſes of Parliament in moſt high and approbious lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, of theſe the prime were Major <hi>Oneale,</hi> Major <hi>Hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Murry,</hi> Capiaine <hi>Chapman,</hi> Captnine <hi>Mountaine,</hi> and ſome others: after ſupper Commiſſarie <hi>Wilinot</hi> came to me with Collonell <hi>Haſtiugs,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Byrom</hi> newly knighted, he commands Prince <hi>Charles</hi> his Troop, Mr. <hi>William Murry,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dudly Smith,</hi> and a Scotch commander, who I remember not, they fell upon mee with high diſcourſe, and told me I was the greateſt enemy the King had in theſe parts of the country where I lived. which I would in time know the King was ſenſible off: and they wondred I durſt come thither, that and my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an officer of the Army conſidered (both which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred me a man regardleſſe either of the Kings power and favour) I told them I was as good a ſubject as the beſt of them, I wiſht better to, and praied more for, and would much more truely ſerve his Majrſty then the beſt of them which upon all occaſions I would be ready to make good, for my comming thither, it was not as an officer, nor as a man relating to the Army, but as a meſſenger ſent to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44768:4"/>
Earle of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> in the buſineſſe of the Parliament, for my boldneſſe, if it were any to come ſo ſent, it was God and my inocency which encouraged and would protect me againſt whomſoever:they told me they admired (ſome things conſidered which they pretended I was indued with,) I ſhould be ſo blinded to appeare in ſuch a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt my King, and act the part of a traitor as all my partakers did: I deſired they would forbear ſuch lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and replyed upon them in ſhort, that I had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what my iudgement and conſcience had dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me, and that upon ſuch mature deliberation with my owne thoughts, and conference with others of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved judgements, that by the helpe of God I would ſtand or fall to the way I had engaged for, which was ſo farre from treaſon, or a thought of ill to his Majeſty in me or any elſe whoſe way I went, that I feared not all the ruine of our oppreſſors, which if done, his Majeſty would clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee his own miſtake, both of them and us, and ſuch of them as ſcaped the ſword, hee would referre to juſtice, that it might appeare wherein hee erred and misbelieved of us, was through them, but I intreated wee might not talke any more of that buſineſſe, it being a point too ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: whereupon they fell to other diſcourſe, told me what great things they had done at <hi>Worceſter</hi> the 23. of <hi>September</hi> laſt, and there ſlaine hundreds of our men and converted (as they called it) Colon. <hi>Sands</hi> both which I anſwered according to what I ſaw and knew. Firſt, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell had declared, fully his heart and words, hee then ſpoke to the world; and ſecondly, there was but twenty five ſlaine on both ſides, which lay upon the place, Major <hi>Douglas,</hi> and a Cornet of theirs, the Lord <hi>Beamonds</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dyed within a day or two after, and foure of their part, one whereof they buried, and carried three with
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44768:4"/>
them dead, and a third part of the twenty five men ſlaine upon the place was theirs, and the hurt men were neere upon as of theirs as ours, ſome of them more ingenuous then the reſt confeſſed the death of the laſt foure, but wondered how it was knowne. I told them the Major of <hi>Woſter</hi> diſcovered, that though he was ſo much theirs, he forgot to ſhew himſelfe a Chriſtian or a man, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, all men were falſe they thought; but now they had taken a good courſe with thoſe about the King; for they had lockt up his Majeſties eares and tongue from the Lords at Court, who they ſay ſaid were both treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and cowardly, as the L. <hi>Dorſet</hi> and others, and they ſwore [with their ancient boldnes and untruth] that the Lord <hi>Dorſet</hi> and others of them about his Majeſty did diſcover and betray the Kings intenſions to our ſide, but now of late hee had learnt to keepe his Councels from them: I told them they had forgot to ſpeake of their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour at <hi>Southam</hi> and <hi>Mancheſter;</hi> to the firſt, they ſwore hard they loſt but three men; to the ſecond, one of them anſwered who had beene upon that ſervice, that they had loſt more there then at all other places; but they laid the fault upon the Earle of <hi>Darby,</hi> who they ſaid was both a foole and a Coward; and ſwore hartily they hoped hee would never come up to them.</p>
            <p>From this Diſcourſe they paſſed on to ieere and revile our Lords as well in <hi>Parliament</hi> as here our Officers in the Army (I eannot forget thoſe baſe ſpeeches they ſpoke againſt the Earle of <hi>Holland,</hi> though I abhor to write them in particular) which was anſwered as it came, and returned with what ſharpneſſe my owne weakneſſe and the preſent condition I was in would admit of. When each man had ſpent his powder, and had his Bout at me, and received his anſwer, I had my diſpatch from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44768:5"/>
               <hi>Wilmot</hi> (who talked as if he had Commiſſion for it) with an anſwere to the Letter I brought (the Prince being rather willing to ſend it to the Court, then trouble me with the carriage of it) and the next morning I had leave with a reſpective Farewell to depatt till our next meeting, which I hope will be about <hi>Dunſmore Heath,</hi> and not long too. In the interim I thought fit to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer theſe to your view, if happily any advantage may come to the Cauſe hereby, I wholly leave it to the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of your ſelfe and thoſe to whom you ſhall think to impart them, whether you make them publique or no, the truth of them I will make good when I ſhall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and will ever reſt;</p>
