            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

might be clear from the blood of all men, in giving them warning to repent, and walk in the Light of the Lord, their lives were not dear to them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing terrified by their adversaries, which to them is an evident token of perdition, but to the patient sufferers, of Salvation and that of God, with whom they have now a reward in the endlesse life; So that in them is fulfilled the words of Christ, <hi>he that will loose his life for my Sake, shall find it,</hi> but we do clearly see in the Light of the Lord, that he that seeks to save his own life will kill the Iust, and therefore we marvel not at what the professors in <hi>New England</hi> (that fled to save themselves) have done;</p>
            <p>Knowing that they which are born after the flesh, will persecute him that is born after the Spirit, but we do even pity to see such as do professe Scriptures have their eyes so shut, and their hearts so grosse, as to think they do God good service when they not onely cast out of their Synagogues, but out of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and do Imprison, Scourge, cut off Ears, and kill those that come to them in the Name and fear of the Lord, and do tremble at Gods Word, working out their Salvation with Fear and Trembling; and here we do appeal to the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God in you all Professors and People, whether the Professors in <hi>New England,</hi> have not acted quite contrary to God, in Imprisoning, Scourging, Banishing and Killing those that tremble at his Word, seeing God hath said to this man will I look, that is of a broken and contrite heart, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth at my Word, but to such the Professing Rulers in <hi>New England</hi> will not look, neither suffer them to have a being amongst them; And again we say, let the witnesse of God in you judge, whether they have not acted directly contrary to Christ in destroying mens lives, seeing he comes not destroy mens lives but to save mens lives, and whether they be not quite out of his Doctrine and Royal Law, which saith, what ever ye would that men should do unto you, do you even so unto them; And we do likewise appeale unto the witnesse of God in all sober people, whether the Pastours and Teachers of the People in <hi>New England</hi> (that stir up and encourage their flocks to persecute to death Gods Servants) be not become bruitish, and contrary to the Ministers of Christ and their flocks, contrary to the <hi>Primitive</hi> Christians, seeing the Ministers of Christ were gentle towards all men, and did not strive nor warr with Carnal Weapons, but did meekly instruct them that did oppose themselves, that with sound Doctrine they might convince their Adversaries, and they both loved and taught the believers that followed them, to love their Enemies, and not kill them, as they have killed those that they account their Enemies, for which they have no cause, unl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sse it be for speaking the Truth; And again, whether these Teachers and Professors, and all that justifie their proceedings against the Lords Servants, be not of that Generation that killed the Prophets, and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully entreated those that were sent unto them, which called the Master of the house <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> and killed the Prince of Life; seeing they do the same things

to them of his Houshold. And Reader,</p>
            <p>That it may appear that these two (which the Professors of <hi>New England</hi> have taken, and by wicked hands put to death) were the Servants of Christ Iesus, and of the Houshold of God, we do here present to thy view these things following, which were writ by their own hands, and sent unto us not long before their death; Together with a Letter which was Writ from <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> in <hi>New England</hi> by <hi>Peter Pearson,</hi> relating the manner of their death, with some of their words which they did expresse a little before their Martyrdom, all which we desire may be seriously weighed and laid to heart, that the witnesse of God may rise in Iudgement against the spirit of persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in whomsoever it appears, to which spirit we exhort all men (that love their Soules) to beware of joyning; and so in love to all People we rest by Faith, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing rather to suffer affliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a Season.</p>

So in bowels of tender love to you all do I speak, and in love and pity to your souls, prize the love of God, and his tender mercy and forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to you, that he did not cut you off in the height of your iniquity, but hath spared you until this day, though you have long taken pleasure in sin, not regarding God that made you, yet hath his Spirit been striving with you many dayes &amp; years, (as it did with me) and hath reproved you time after time, for the evil of your doings, but you regarded it not, though it often called upon you in love &amp; meekness to depart from your iniquity, and that which you have been addicted to; it hath reproved and called you that have been addicted to drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, lying and swearing to depart from these things, for they are evil, and it hath called upon you that are proud and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous to depart from them, and hath reproved you that have been wild and wanton, and given to sports and pleasures, to depart from them, and run on no longer in vanity, but you did not regard it, but took pleasure in sin. Oh consider dear Neighbors and People, what you have been doing ever since you came to years of maturity, and let the witnesse of God which is faithful and true in you all arise and answer, to which I speak, and it will let you see that you have provoked the Lord,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96806:4"/>
and vexed his righteous soul from day to day, and have pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him with your sins and iniquities, as a cart is pressed with sheaves, yet hath he born it with patience and hath suffered long, not willing that you should perish and dye in your sins but still he hath waited year after year upon you to be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to you, but you have refused to return, and hearken to his Call and Counsel, but have run on in the broad way, as your Forefathers have done so do ye, and follow their Customs and Traditions which are vain, and will not profit you at all in the day of the Lord, when he comes to call you to an account how you have spent your time; so consider and lay it to heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the evil day come upon you, least the Spirit of the Lord cease striving with you, for verily the day is coming on apace that the Spirit of the Lord will cease striving with man, who puts the Day of God far from him, then it will be said, <hi>He that is Righteous let him be Righteous still, and he that is filthy, let him be filthy still.</hi> So dear Friends and People young and old, prize your time while you have it, and do not slight the Counsel of the Lord any longer, least the day of your visitation passe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your heads at unawares which cannot be called again, and as I said before, Spend your mony no longer for that which is not bread, in following Diviners of lyes, for they cause you to erre and go astray by their lyes and by their lightnesse, like sheep without a shepherd, for they are blind Watchmen which leads you out of the way, like troops of Robbers to devour you, <hi>Hos. ch.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 9 and makes merchandize of your souls, as they did upon me and thousands besides, which the Lord hath delivered as birds out of the Fowlers net; so being escaped from them, we see their deceit and subtle hypocrisie which long hath lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them, and therefore we cannot but declare against them, because they are seen to be such as devour widows houses for dishonest gain, and makes a prey upon you as they have done upon us, for they seek their gain from their quarter, and feeds themselves with the fat, and clothes themselves with the best of the wooll, as the false prophets did of old, which the true Prophets declared against; and with the same light that the true Prophets saw the false prophets of old, do we see these Priests in this generation, for their fruits makes them manifest what trees they are; For they sue men at the Law for Tithes, and take them by force, false Prophet like, and who cannot
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96806:4"/>
put into their mouths for conscience sake, they prepare War against them, and with cruelty &amp; oppression cause their goods to be taken from them to satisfie their wits and greedy desires; so they make themselves manifest to be of that generation, and to walk in their steps that the true Prophet spake of, who were greedy dumb doggs that can never have enough, as thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands do witnesse at this day, and you may see it to be so with the Priests of this generation, for in <hi>Balaams</hi> steps they are walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who loved the wages of unrighteousnesse, as they do in this generation, but they exceed him in cruelty; for though he loved it, he did not sue for it, but these Priests do in this generation, of which I am a witnesse, and thousands besides, who have suffered by them, to the spoiling of their goods and estates; Oh it is seen, it is seen in this our day that the filthy and abominable thing is committed in the land, as it was of old, the Prophets prophecy falsely, and the Priests bear Rule by their means, and the people love to have it so, but what will you do in the end thereof saith the Lord Almighty, for they have dawbed you up with untempered morter, and are Physicians of no value to you, for they have long been sowing pillows under your arm-holes, and have spoken smooth things to you, in healing that in you which is for destruction, and seeks to kill that which should live, that so they might rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you as Kings in the Earth, and you to worship the Beast and his Image, who is making war with the Lamb, but the day of their downfal is at hand, and the Lamb shall have the victory, and Rule and Reign in his People for ever and ever, for now he is arisen in the Power of his Spirit, with great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Authority, to slay the wicked and cut down his enemies that resist him in his way; And they that will not have him to Reign over them, must fall before him who is our Head, who will render vengeance in flames of fire upon all his enemies. So dear People be awakened, and stand up to Judgement, and live no longer in carelesnesse and Carnal security, but own the Light of Christ to be your guide, for a measure of it is given to every one of you to profit withall, and it is nigh you in your hearts and in your mouths, the word of Faith which is able to save your Souls; so all to it take heed that by it you may be quickened and revived again out of your fallen estate wherein you lie by reason of your transgressions,

which have made a separation between you and your Maker, and verily I say unto you, except ye be regenerate and born again, you cannot enter into the Kingdom of God; So dear People young and Old, I speak to you all as one, consider how you have spent your time, and let a true search passe through you all, that you may see whom you have been serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all your time, for Servants you are to whom you do obey; So dear People be not deceived, for God will not be mocked, such as you sow, such you must reap from the hand of the Lord, and receive according to your deeds whether they be good or evil, who will give a reward to every man according as his works shall be, for he is a God that will not wink at wickedness nor let the transgressor go unpunished, to whom every knee shall bow and every tongue confesse him Lord, who created Heaven and Earth, whom we serve and Worship, who is our Lord and King, and Captain of our Salvation, Our Leader and Guider, and our Preserver night and day, our Mighty and Strong One, the Mighty God of <hi>Israel</hi> is his Name, the wonderful Counsellor and Prince of our Peace, whose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence is with us to the confounding of our Enemies that rise up in opposition against us, for he goes before us who is our Life to tread down our Enemies under his feet, who is terrible to the wicked, and all that forgets him must be turned into Hell, where the worm dies not, and the fire never goes out, the swearer and the lyar must go thither, that is their portion, the Drunkard and the Whore-monger must go thither, the proud and Covetous cannot escape the damnation of Hell, and all they that lives <hi>Dives</hi> like must pertake of <hi>Dives</hi> torment which is coming upon them, from which they cannot escape nor flie from, and all such must go into the lake with the Beast<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the false Prophet which have long born rule by their means in England, and in the Nations abroad, for they have devoured my Flock, and the Sheep of my pasture, saith the Lord Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, who will be avenged on them, for the wounded they have not healed, nor comforted those who were sick, neither have they brought back again that which was driven away, but with force and cruelty have they ruled, but the Lord God is now come in his Mighty Power, to take their power from them, and deliver his People out of their hands, which have long been made a prey upon by them, and reward them double
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96806:5"/>
for their doings; So you my dear neighbours, do not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them any longer in their sin, in satisfying their greedy desires, least you pertake with them of their plagues, and of the wrath of God that is coming upon them, from which they cannot escape, for they have grieved the Spirit of the Lord from day to day, to see what havock they have made in the Nation of <hi>England,</hi> by spoyling and causing spoyl to be made of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Goods and Estates, Oh! their sin is great and grievous to be born, and the cry of their oppression and their iniquity is entered into the eares of the Lord, that he is even grieved and sore vexed at them, for they have trampled upon his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in them, and have pressed him with their sin as a Cart is pressed with sheaves, so that he can bear no longer with them, because their iniquity doth abound. Oh! search the Scriptures and see if they do not go beyond and exceed the fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Yea surely, he is arisen already, to shake the Nations that resist him, and hath given the Power to his Son, which shall rule the Nations with a Rod of Iron, and they that will not bow to his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment must be destroyed and broken to pieces, the mouth of the Lord of Hosts hath spoken it.</p>

do I speak, the Lord is my witnesse, that this is not written in any prejudice of mind to any mans person, neither in preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice or envy against the Priests or the false prophets, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their evil actions which we see in them, which we loath and detest; for never did the true Prophets of the Lord seek their gain from their Quarter, as these Priests now do in this generation, nor ever did they sue men at law for Tithes, as these Priests do now, neither did they the Lord sent forth to declare his mind and will make bargains with people for so much a year, or abide in one Town for many years together, as these Priests do now, nay they went from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from City to City, and from Country to Country, in obedience to the Command of the Lord, as <hi>Ieremiah</hi> and the rest of the true Ministers did, to whom the Word of the Lord came, saying, <hi>I have ordained thee a Prophet unto the Nations,</hi> Mark, not to a Town or a City, to remain in for many years together, but to the Nations, and in obedience to the living God, he te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified against the World that their deeds were evil, but they could not bear his words, but said he was worthy to die, and so the Priests and false Prophets joyned with the Princes and Rulers of the people, and cast him into prison and into the dungeon, where he did sink amongst the mire that was in it, Read in his prophesie and you will find it so, and this was that which the true Prophets and Ministers of Christ received from the World where they went, stocking, whipping and Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonments; thus were they requited evil for good in all Ages, for their love which they did bear to the souls of the Sons of men, and the same must we expect from this generation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we live, we whom the Lord hath called to place his Name in, and hath sent us forth in this day of his love, to preach his Everlasting Gospel to them which dwell upon the earth, in love and pity to their souls, but they regard it not, though we go thousands of miles for the Seeds sake which lies in death, yet the reward of our labour from them is prisons, and whips to scourge us withal, and knives prepared to cut off ears, and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons hot to burn in the hand; thus are we requited evil for good, for testifying against the World that their deeds are evil, and therefore do they hate us as they did Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and calls us Deceivers, Fools and Hereticks, Jesuites and the like, because we speak the truth to them, and cannot

So all People turn home into your own tents, that you may see where you are, and what you are feeding upon, and wander no longer abroad with your minds in the earth, after that which will perish and come to an end, where the moth &amp; rust doth corrupt, and thieves break through and steal, and deprive you of your substance that you have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together by fraud and deceit, which may be soon taken from you, and you left desolate, naked and bare; therefore it stands you all in hand to seek after that which will endure for ever, the Pearl of great price, which doth exceed all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> for its durable and will last for ever, the Rock of Ages on which the Saints was built, the chief Corner Stone Elect and Precious, the sure foundation of many generations, the pillar and ground of Truth, Christ the light the bright and morning Star, the Sun of Righteousnesse which is now arisen with healing in his wings, to cleanse the Lepar of his leprosie, and hath caused the dumb to speak and the deaf to hear his Voice and follow him, and this hath he done in this day of his power, which makes the Heathen to wonder and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded at his appearance in his Sons and Daughters, who beare his Image, who are meek and lowly, Lamb-like, the Righteous knows him who loves his appearance, but to the wicked his presence is dreadful and terrible like a Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> to consume with the Breath of his Mouth, and break to pieces like a Potters vessel all the stiffe necked and strong ones who lives in the pride of their hearts and at ease in the flesh, like fat Bulls of <hi>Bashan,</hi> spending the Creation upon their Lusts; Oh the day is at hand that all such must be as chaffe before the wind, and as stubble before the fire which will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume them, &amp; leave them neither root nor branch, the Mouth of the Lord of Hosts hath spoken it; therefore take heed what you do, and follow not the multitude to do evil, for they walk in the broad way which leads to destruction and to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Death, where the Souls of men and women are plunged into misery and torment, and into the Pit of perdition, where they cannot come out nor be loosed from their cruel bonds, where they are chained and fettered fast, under the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of darknesse, who is King of the bottomlesse Pit, the old Dragon which goes about like a roaring Lyon seeking whom he may devour, and they that are from the watch,

watch, they are from the Rock and sure Foundation, Christ the Light and Life of his People, and all that are from him, they are in darknesse and such are taken in the snares of the Devil, who rules in the dark, for there he hath his seat, in the Earthly part of man which is one with him, who is the unclean spirit, which seeks to destroy and lay wast the Heritage of God, that so his kingdom might be set up, Who is a lier &amp; a murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; but now is the day come that Christ is risen to Reign as Lord and King in his People, &amp; therefore doth Antichrist rage in his members because his destruction is at hand, and his torment is coming upon him, wherein he must have and receive a just recompence of his reward, and all that joyns with him must partake of his torment for what they have done against God and his People; And so dear Neighbours and People, joyn with him no longer who is the Enemie of God, least you be cut off from the Face of the Earth, and destroyed with <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> that crooked Serpent, which must go into everlasting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there to remain for evermore, where there is weeping and gnashing of Teeth, and no comfort nor ease to be found, but howling &amp; bitter lamentation night and day, and this will be the portion of the wicked that live wantonly upon the Earth; Oh! the day will come that they will wish they had their time to spend over again, when their misery comes upon them, and the darts of the Almighty striks them &amp; wounds them to the heart, then will their pain be great, which cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, which they must feel night and day; Oh! that you would lay these things to heart, and consider your latter end, and this I speak in love to you all whether you will hear or forbear, you shall one day know and be made to confesse what is written to you is true; Therefore take heed what you do that resist and quench the motions of the Spirit of God in you, when it doth arise to shew you your conditions wherein you lie, for you that do resist the Lord in his way, you do despite unto the Spirit of Grace; So dear people young and old, resist the Lord no longer in his appearance in you, for you that do, you slay the witnesse the Messenger of the Covenant in you, and so becomes guilty of blood; Therefore take heed of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on in the hardnesse of your hearts, and in speaking evil of the Truth, though <hi>Baalam</hi> erred from the Spirit of Truth, yet it was the same then that it is now, though <hi>Iudas</hi> betrayed

to pass to the Town of <hi>Boston, my life to lay down in his Will, for the accomplishing of his service that he had there to perform at the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed</hi>; to which <hi>heavenly voice</hi> I presently yielded obedience, not questioning the Lord how he would bring the thing to pass, being I was a Child, and obedience was demanded of me by the Lord, who filled me with living strength and power from his Heavenly presence, which at that time did mightily over-shadow me, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     <p>ON the <hi>20</hi>th day of the <hi>8</hi>th Month, <hi>1659.</hi> I with my beloved com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, <hi>Marmaduke Stevenson</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Mary Dyer</hi> of <hi>Rhode Island</hi> was had into the Court, where <hi>John Indicott</hi> with others of his Councel were assembled, and soon after, we were come to the Bar before them, <hi>John Indicott</hi> called to the Keeper of the Prison to pull off our <hi>Hats,</hi> which was done accordingly; when did <hi>John Indicott</hi> begin to speak unto us as a man out of the dust, whose life is departing from him, so faintly did he utter his words unto us, to this effect, <hi>That they had made several Laws, and tryed and endeavoured by several wayes to keep us from among them, and neither whipping, nor imprisoning, nor cutting off ears, nor banishing upon pain of death, would not keep us from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them;</hi> and he said also, <hi>He or they desired not the death of any of us;</hi> yet notwithstanding his following words were, <hi>Give ear &amp; hearken now to your Sentence of Death,</hi> said <hi>John Indicott</hi> their Governour; so after these words were spoken by him he stopt, the words being uttered very faintly out of his mouth; then I did make way to speak to <hi>John Indicott</hi> and the rest of the Court, which was as I remember to this effect, I desired I might read a Paper to them and the people there present (which was many) which was a Declaration of my Call, wherein was declared the Reasons and Causes of my staying in their Iurisdiction with my Companion, after banishment <hi>upon death,</hi> which had been pronounced against us, and two more friends
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96806:13"/>
(the one of which is a sufferer now with us) on the <hi>8</hi>th day of the <hi>7</hi>th month last; at which words speaking, <hi>John Indicott</hi> their Governour in a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manner (for rage and madness like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was got up in him) said, <hi>I should not read it, neither would they hear it read;</hi> which thing onely at that time I desired before the sentence of <hi>death</hi> was pronounced against us, yet he would not grant it; so I seeing, and being sensible of their hardness of heart that they are given up to work wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness, and commit murder in labouring to take the lives of the innocent from the earth, I said unto them, seeing that I could not be suffered to read it in the hearing of the people, nor suffered to have it read unto the people that then was present, I said, <hi>I should leave the Paper with them,</hi> which I did soon cast upon the Table amongst them, and the Secretary or some other handed it to the Governour, who read it himself, but would not let it be read in the hearing of the people, and when he had looked a certain time on it, he called me by my name and said, <hi>I needed not have made such ado, or desired to have it read;</hi> for he said, <hi>I had spoke more then that unto them the day before concerning it;</hi> which I had not, for there is many words in the Paper which I did not then utter unto them; so that I desired the thing again, that all that was there present might bear it, but he would not suffer it; but soon after in envy called me by my name, and said unto me, <hi>Hearken unto your Sentence of death,</hi> which be uttered forth to this effect (in which time I was silent) he said <hi>William Robinson This is your Sentence, you shall be had back from the place from whence you came, and from thence to the place of Execution, to be hanged on the Gallows, till you are dead;</hi> this was the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>death John Indicott</hi> their Governour pronounced against me, and soon after called to the Goaler to have me away, which he did accordingly.</p>

                     <p>DEar Brethren unto whom my life is united in the invisible unlimited power of the Lord God Almighty, I give you a relation of divers pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96806:16"/>
wherein is tidings of heavinesse and joy; Our dear brethren the two Servants of the Lord, <hi>William Robinson,</hi> and <hi>Marmaduke Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phenson,</hi> have finished their course in the pure dominion and Eternal Majestie of the Almighty God, and are laid down in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome in the Heavenly Kingdom of endlesse felicity, where the life of all the upright is united with their life to all perpetuity; So that their memorial shall <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver rot,</hi> for their name <hi>their life</hi> is left upon heavenly record, and shall never be blotted out from the life of the Tribe of the Faithful. Vpon the <hi>9</hi>th. day of the <hi>4</hi>th. moneth <hi>1659.</hi> the <hi>4</hi>th. day of the week had all us English Friends that were abroad in this Country a meeting upon <hi>Road Island,</hi> the <hi>6</hi>th. day following of the same week at a Ferry side upon <hi>Road Island,</hi> did one friend whose name is <hi>William Leddra</hi> and I part with <hi>Christopher Holder, Marmaduke Stephenson, and William Robinson,</hi> we being about to passe over the Ferry, to travel into this part of the Countrey called <hi>Plimmouth Colony;</hi> At the end of two dayes journey we came to a Town therein called <hi>Sandwich,</hi> and the day following had a pretty peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able meeting, and it was with us if we did escape apprehending in this <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony,</hi> to have traveled into <hi>Bostons</hi> Iurisdiction, but the second and last meeting that we had determined to have at <hi>Sandwich,</hi> in it we were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and had before the Governour and Magistrates, and by them commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this Prison, where we have remained <hi>5.</hi> moneths and upward; And being we deny to defray the charges that they have brought themselves into by medling with us (namely their wicked Officers fees,) and also refusing to make an engagement to come into the government no more, we are by their Law to remain close prisoners during the Courts pleasure; But well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent we are, rejoycing that we are worthy to suffer as witnesses for the Lord against them, and their Law, and the thick power of darknesse by which they did establish it; This knowing that for our Testimonies sake bonds must abide us during the Lords pleasure; The day after we were taken Prisoners, was <hi>William Robinson,</hi> and <hi>Marmaduke Stephenson</hi> imprisoned at <hi>Boston,</hi> where they remained until the <hi>7</hi>th. Moneth; in the forepart of the <hi>7</hi>th. Moneth they were had before their Court of Assistance, and after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers passages in their examination, the Iury (whom they witnessed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst as unfit men to try their cause being out of the Doctrine of Christ) when they gave in their verdit, said they had found them to be <hi>Quakers;</hi> So when they were found and judged by their ungodly Law, to be guilty of the sentence of Banishment upon pain of Death, they were returned to Prison a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and after a little time were had again before their Iudgment Seat, and the sentence of banishment upon <hi>pain of Death</hi> past upon them, against which their <hi>Life</hi> did arise in power and dominion, being the Lord had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to stay, and <hi>William Robinson</hi> declared unto them how it stood between them and God, and if they did put them to <hi>Death</hi> for trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing

their commandement, they would become guilty of <hi>Innocent blood,</hi> and gave them warning in the Name of the Lord to beware of shedding inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent blood, with more expressions that cut them to the quick; And although they had passed the sentence of Banishment upon them, yet this overplus to vent their furious mindes in torturing the outward man whilest they had it, they made a decree to have <hi>William</hi> whipt, and commanded the Constable to get a man that was able to do it; So a man being prepared and had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Court, and judged a man fit for their purpose, they had <hi>William Robinson</hi> into the open street, and there stript him and put his hands thorow the holes of the Cariage of a great Gun, where the Iaylor (a member of their Church held them till the whipper gave him twenty stripes with a threefold Cord whip with knots at the ends, which stripes he laid upon his body without mercy or pity according to the hearts desire of some of the blood-thirsty rulers, who bad whip him severely; So when they had inflicted this barbarous action upon his body, then they returned him with <hi>Marmaduke Stephenson</hi> again to Prison, and wrote an order to the Iaylor to discha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
