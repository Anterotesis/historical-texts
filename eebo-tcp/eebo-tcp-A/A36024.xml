            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Full and Distinct ACCOUNT OF THE Late Commotions IN Constantinople.</head>
            <p>AMong the Considerations that may move the minds of Great men to enquire with exact Diligence into things that daily occurr in matters of State, none of the smallest is that of shrifting into the rises and Motives of Changes and Tempests of Government, by reason that very often from a a most inconsiderable Cause are derived the total subversions of Kingdoms, though barely to reflect upon the beginning of these vicissitudes, would be esteemed a thing rather worthy of ridiculous Contempt, than of mature Consideration. The first Monarchy of the World, which was that of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> had its fall from a most frivolous and accidental Contingency, through <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> their last King suffering himself to be seen in a Female Habit by his Generall, whence that of the <hi>Modes</hi> had its rise, which again meerly by a Dream was tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled down the Precipice, and so the others that started up can hardly boast any more considerable Origine of their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48635:3"/>
Thus it is not only usefull, but also necessary for Princes to observe minutely the train of things, in the matter of the winding up the fate of Great Potentates, that so in the School of the Events of others they may find their own instruction, and so provide themselves with Preservatives against the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the like Cases.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ottoman</hi> Monarchy, which for many Ages has been raised up to the highest pitch by Victories and Conquests, now like to the former, is running on to a ruinous Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice: And though it has used its utmost efforts to uphold it self against the violence and Impetuosities of contrary Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, which guide it to a Fall, yet must it suffer the vicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Natural things, which after having encreas'd to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain pitch of greatness, pay the necessary Tribute to their Decay and Debasement. The late Convulsions which have been for some Months at <hi>Constantinople</hi> have more than a little contributed to the Depression of that Empire, with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the <hi>Grand Signior Mahomet,</hi> and the advancing of <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> his Brother; adding thereunto the total Change of the Principal Ministers, who with the spilling of their own Blood have stained the new Monarchs Purple. The Knowledge of this is come to and spread throughout the whole World, but alter'd either by passion or affection, conformably as Interest or Adulation requires, and the particulars of those Convulsions have been divulg'd neither with that Evidence nor that Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as my intention is to do at present, desiring to give the ensuing Account, as it was taken upon the Place of the Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences herein related, and from such Persons as would secure it of the judicious consideration and virtuous Curiosity of the most noble Geniusses.</p>
            <p>Before that the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> seconded by other Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Squadrons had near <hi>Esseck</hi> disorder'd, put to flight and utterly routed the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army, Intestine Dissentions over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd the same by the means of <hi>Soliman Pacha, Grand Vizier,</hi> and <hi>Osman Chiaus Pacha,</hi> because that this Latter ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ever before been us'd to be the head of the <hi>Asiatique</hi> High-way-men, and to scowr over all without any Military Discipline, one while Plundering one Village, and then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48635:3"/>
and withall not scorning to robb and strip Passengers, he could not confine himself to the streights of a Pass assign'd him by the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> in order to guard it, and very bitterly bore with the being subordinate to other Peoples Commands, whereupon the Pass being attack'd by the Imperial Troups, the Most Serene Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> having advanc'd at the head of them with incomparable Resolution, he presently made <hi>Osman</hi> sensible that his Dastardly Retreat was the having to do with Martializ'd Men; that his pretended Valour was only the false Bravery of Highway-Men, and that it was a Temerarious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption in him to think chat the Conduct or flashy Gallantry of a Robber could entitle him to the Soldiery. This occasion'd the <hi>Grand Vizier's</hi> and <hi>Osmans</hi> Impraching each other at the Port of the Unhappy success of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Armies. But the <hi>Viziers</hi> Party prevail'd as being grounded upon Reason, and as having made appear that he in the Retrenchments of the Quarters, and in ordering of the Troups, had not been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to exert the Talents of a Prudent and Experienc'd Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; if the other had shewn that of a Faithfull Minister in maintaining so very important a Post as was left to his Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and Custody. In the mean while orders were dispatcht from the Port to the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> to secure <hi>Osman</hi> and his Adherents, by putting them in Prison or else to Death, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably as he should judge most Expedient for the weal of the present Posture of Affairs. He, however being of a Nature very distant from imbruing his Hands in the Subjects Blood, considered, that it was not then a time to foment the boiling humours of the Army that was in over-great Dejection and Confusion through the late Defeat, he judg'd it more advisable to conceal and surcease the supream order, and to connive at all patiently till a more convenient season, or that a more happy conjuncture afforded him the opportunity of executing it without a noise. But <hi>Osman</hi> who had by other means pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated the secret, manag'd himself with Extraordinary Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ever labouring under Apprehensions of being unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly surpriz'd, and being a Person that knew how to capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the Affections of the <hi>Militia</hi> by the hopes of Booty, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, and sped in making them Mutiny against <hi>Soliman,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:48635:4"/>
who having neither forces to resist, nor means to pacify the Soldiery, esteem'd it a judicious Resolution by flight to escape from the Rage of the Mutinous Troups, as he did in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the <hi>Tefterdar</hi> or Grand Treasurer, and the <hi>Rais Effendi</hi> or Great Chancellor, going in a Boat upon the <hi>Danube</hi> as far as <hi>Russe,</hi> and from thence passing Post to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> where he stay'd to attend the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> orders.</p>
            <p>But because the rout of the Army had occasion'd a more than ordinary Confusion in the <hi>Grand Signior's</hi> Mind, <hi>Regeb Pacha,</hi> the <hi>Kaimecam,</hi> found it a difficult Province to pacify him, and to make him sensible that it was an effect of fortune, and not any want of failure in the General: It becoming <hi>Regeb</hi> to be more than ordinary urgent to uphold <hi>Solimans</hi> Reputation, as having been advanced by him to the Office of <hi>Kaimacam</hi>; And accordingly he at length succeeded, and withall obtain'd a Promise from the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> to be made <hi>Grand Vizier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean while <hi>Osman Chiause's</hi> Mutinous Troups gave no small matter for Apprehension; seeing after having Sack'd and Plunder'd the Tents and Moveables of the <hi>Vizier Soliman</hi> upon his flight, they would also make appear to the Port, this to have been done through a Motive of just Resentment, and not the effect of a Rebellious Spirit. For this intent they elected out of the Body of the Army four Commissioners, whom they sent to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> at the same time that the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> to quiet them had ordered that a Vest and Sword should be dispatcht to <hi>Osman</hi> declaring him <hi>Seraskier,</hi> and had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>Soliman</hi> to repair to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> While <hi>Soliman</hi> was on his way thither, he had notice from sure hands of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Commissioners or Deputies journey, and understood, that the Demand they had to make in the name of the whole Army, was, that they would absolutely have him deposed from being <hi>Grand Visier.</hi> Upon this he made a halt, and having consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed severall Opinions, he determined to consigne the seal and Prophets Standard to the <hi>Tefterdar</hi> and to <hi>Rais Effendi,</hi> that they might present them to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and he having left the high Road god privately into <hi>Constantinople.</hi> He would not go directly to hazard his own Person at a time that the Deputies of the Army might have inculcated some distaste in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48635:4"/>
               <hi>Grand Signier's</hi> Mind, whom fear did easily make suceptible of any impression; but thought expedient to keep private, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that by the means of the <hi>Kaimecan</hi> his Creature to faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate his ingresse to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and that he might with the more Security make his vindication, when the Deputies were departed.</p>
            <p>These Deputies had their Audience, and their Demand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing understood, the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> was at a loss for Councill, and compell'd by the present necessity, he determin'd <hi>Osman Chiaus Pacha</hi> for <hi>Vizier,</hi> dispatching the Seal to him with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets standard by the <hi>Selicter,</hi> who is the Officer that carries the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> Sword; furthermore commanding expressly <hi>Rais Effendi,</hi> and the <hi>Tefterdar</hi> to return with all dilligence to the Camp.</p>
            <p>While that in <hi>Constantinople</hi> such Resolutions were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to apply speedy Remedies to all these Evills, came notice to the Court, that the Soldiery being become more contumatious than ever, were not only intent upon their own satisfaction, but proceeding from Military to Politicall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, pretended to lay hand to the Helme, and with the Sword cut through the Chain of the present Government. The Soldiers consider'd, that the Principall Ministers, being brought into discredit with, and Suspition of the Prince, he would have neither force nor Councill to resist the Violence of a Resolute Army. The <hi>Grand Signior</hi> labour'd under such a daunting sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize that he would have postpon'd any Political considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Preservation of his own Person and Degree; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Soldiers having gain'd their Point of placing in the management of publick Affairs Ministers depending on them, might the more freely give a loose to their Rapines, Insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and undue and boundless Pretentions of Pay, without fearing Correction, seeing those who were to obviate such exorbitances were of their party; and then having once set foot upon the Authority of their supreme Lord, it would be no difficult matter in other Occurrences to improve the same means for the attaining of their Demands. In the mean while they marched away for <hi>Constantinople</hi> with a firm Resolution and most solemn Vow to reform the present Government, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48635:5"/>
to cause to fall as victimes to their own establishment the Head of the <hi>Kislar Aga,</hi> and Chief of the Black <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> who was the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> Chiefest Favourite, and many Others as well within as without the <hi>Seraglio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This unexpected Advice did in such manner surprize <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets</hi> mind, as not being a person us'd to such like Encounters, that he absolutely lost all hopes not only of interrupting the execution of this Design, but also of making the least opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Indeed <hi>Regeb Kaimecam</hi> did with a Courageous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Spirit face all these threatning Dangers, and advis'd the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> to retire into the <hi>Great Seraglio,</hi> and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it with his choicest and valiantest Troups as a Bank a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the inundations of the Rebellious squadrons. He made a shift to give his Prince to understand that the suddenly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way to the temerity of mutinying Subjects, was a giving them Liberty and Encouraging them to have often recourse to the like disloyall way of proceeding, which they would the less doubt their succeeding in, seeing they had allready trac'd out a path to the accomplishment of their rash and insolent Demands. That the making head in such like cases was the shewing that to Command and Authority he had united sense &amp; Courage to maintain them. That the insolent Multitude was like an airy vapour, that upon the bare appearing of the Raies of it's Lawfull Prince immediately dissolves away, and is reduc'd to the state of true Obedience. That did he but stand Firm and Constant in not suffering the Rights and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of his Crown to be Usurp'd, he would by the effects find the steadyness of his Councills. But such Exhortations as these prevail'd little upon the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> because that fear having possess'd and darkned his understanding, did not suffer him to discern the Clearness of these Reasons. This notwithstanding, this Trusty Minister would needs have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to new Means to obviate the Inconveniences, that were abrooding, and repairing to the <hi>Mufti</hi> he would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured of him to issue out a Proclamation or Sentence, by which to declare guilty of High Treason and Rebells all those that should have the insolence to oppose and not punctually obey the orders of the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi> But the <hi>Mufti</hi> knowing such

a Declaration to be void, when the not executing the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Orders is an immediate Offence of Delinquency, judg'd it sounder Counsel, to decline such a Province, and the rather, seeing Force and not Law prevail'd in the present Juncture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Regeb</hi> being excluded from those hopes, did for his last shift feel the <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Ianizaries</hi> Pulse, meaning, (upon a supposition of his being stedfast and constant in his Loyalty to his Prince) to try whether he was able in some manner to bring down the Arrogancy of the Tumultuous Soldiery, and both fix the staggering Throne to its Lawfull Sovereign, and divert the impending ruine; and he found him not averse to his Intentions. But so much Diligence us'd by the <hi>Kaimecam</hi> for the <hi>Grand Signior's</hi> good, brought forth a most sinistrous effect, because while he was contriving and procuring the Safety and Maintenance of his Emperour's State and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, he pull'd down upon himself the loss of his employ, Liberty, and finally of his very Life. For the <hi>Kizlar,</hi> seeing so many motions of the <hi>Kaimecam,</hi> grew more than a little jealous of all these Goings and Comings, doubting that he kept Intelligence with and fomented the Seditious Army, and was minded to strike in with the Mutinous Troups: Yet this suspition, however contrary to the Truth, being communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by the <hi>Kizlar</hi> to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> had such efficacy, that Orders were given to take the poor <hi>Kaimecam</hi> into Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody. This must necessarily have been a piece of wantonness in <hi>Mahomets</hi> Fortune, that must needs make him himself the Author of his own Ruine, and thus push from him the only Prop that contriv'd all manner of means to uphold his sinking Authority. Wherefore <hi>Bostangi Pachi</hi> being commanded to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure <hi>Regeb,</hi> he went to his House, and shewing him the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Order, it was received by him with all manner of seeming unconcern and Resignation; And thus shewing a most ready Obedience, he immediately order'd his Servants to get him a Horse ready, going along with the Minister to the Stairs foot, where being come he told the <hi>Bostangi Pachi,</hi> that it would not be inconvenient that he return'd to his Lodgings, to take some <hi>Zecchins</hi> along with him, &amp; knowing frankness &amp; Gayety
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48635:6"/>
to be very efficacious means to speak his Innocency, he cry'd, jest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, Money even makes those Clean, that are really tainted, &amp; the Ministers train being already far advanc'd, he was only accompany'd by the <hi>Aga</hi> to his Closet-door, wherein entring, and having open'd a back-Door that led into the Garden, he that way slipt out of the hands of his Guards, and rov<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d from <hi>Constantinople</hi> through the fields for the space of twenty Miles; but his flight being known by the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> he ordered some to go in pursuit of him with all Celerity and Diligence, and he was found in a field not only over-whelm'd with his misfortunes, but likewise with weariness and hunger, and thence conducted a Prisoner into the <hi>Seraglio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every shaddow of suspicion that came into the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> Head was sufficient to put him upon the Extremest Resolutions: And now doubting that the <hi>Mufti</hi> confined to <hi>Bursia,</hi> and the Deposed <hi>Vizier Ibrahim,</hi> Exil'd to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> did fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the tumults of the Army, he thought Expedient to Banish the former to a more remote Place; that so the Distance might deprive him of the Conveniency of Tampering with the Militia; and then sent the <hi>Capigi Pachi</hi> to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> with orders to take off the said <hi>Ibrahims</hi> head. This <hi>Pachi</hi> was carried by a <hi>Beg,</hi> who was much <hi>Ibrahims</hi> friend; and was the same that with his own Galley had conducted him to his Banishment in <hi>Rhodes.</hi> Insomuch that this <hi>Beg</hi> being come to <hi>Ibrahims</hi> House, he found him dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing with some Company, &amp; having paid him his Respects, he was ask'd, if there were any orders concerning him, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd no, for that the <hi>Capigi</hi> had kept them secret: While they were discoursing in came the <hi>Capigi,</hi> and having kiss'd <hi>Ibrahims</hi> Vest, he sat down to drink Coffee in the others Company, which being done he laid his hand upon his Breast, from which <hi>Ibrahim</hi> conceived some suspicion, as conjecturing what ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually followed, for immediately he imparted to him the order for the having his head.</p>
            <p>This News so much afflicted <hi>Ibrahim</hi> that having embrac'd a little Son that sat upon his Knees, he remain'd a while without speaking, then kissing him, &amp; weeping, he commanded that they should take the Child away, then turning to the <hi>Capigi</hi> he said him: <hi>Was it not sufficient for the Court the having divested me of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48635:6"/>
all my Wealth and means, confined to this Place divested of all conveniences and of Liberty it self, but that it must also deprive me of my Life; what can the Blood of an Vnfortunate Wretch avail the Prince, and what suspicion can redound to the Crown from a Man deposed from all Authority &amp; Conveniency. I must indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that misfortunes never go alone, but like to a Chain one ring is link'd within another</hi>: and casting his eye upon the string that was to strangle him, and perceiving it to be too thick, he cry'd <hi>that such a Cord was only fit to dispatch a Dog or other Beast,</hi> and immediately sent a servant to fetch a Bow-string, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self made a knot in it, and while he was washing, before he said his Prayers, he lather'd the Bow-string with sope, and then having ended his Prayers, he was strangled, and his Head being cut from his Body was caryed to <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The foresaid <hi>Scelectar</hi> being sent by the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> with the Seal and Standard for the <hi>new Visier Osman</hi> met the Army at <hi>Nisse</hi> near <hi>Sophia,</hi> just in the time that the Soldiers had in a Tumult kill'd <hi>Emir Pacha,</hi> and the <hi>Tefterdar,</hi> for having aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned them and followed the <hi>Vizier</hi> in his flight: They also kill'd <hi>Ali Effendi</hi> the said <hi>Emir</hi>'s Predecessour in the Treasury, and one <hi>Aghen Zade,</hi> a man of above Eighty years old, who formerly was <hi>Rais Effendi,</hi> meerly because he admonish'd them not to spill <hi>Mussulmen</hi> Blood, was by them pursued to death, but he escaping into the <hi>Vizier</hi>'s Tent, was by him cover'd with his own Vest; but then seeing the Soldiers would inexorably take away his Life, that he might not endanger both his own Authority and Throat, he gave him over to their fury.</p>
            <p>In the Beginning of their rage <hi>Rais Effendi</hi> made his escape, and since that time we have had no certain Knowledge of him.</p>
            <p>The two Secretaries of the Chancery, desired to be strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led secretly, rather then to be put into the Soldiers hands, and were gratified in this their Request, and were put to Death behind the <hi>Vizier</hi>'s Tent, and afterwards their Bodies expos'd to the view of the whole Army.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ianizary Aga Mustafa Pacha,</hi> who was in the same Employ at the Siege of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and in the Attack of <hi>Buda</hi> was made <hi>Seraskier,</hi> did in these tumults run a great risque of his Life, and it was not without very hard shifts that the <hi>Vizier</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:48635:7"/>
was able to save him; But because he was a <hi>Ianizary,</hi> they contented themselves with divesting him of his Employ, send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to Command at the <hi>Dardanells</hi> instead of <hi>Mustapha Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi> the Son of <hi>Kiupergli</hi>; who was sent for by the <hi>Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi> and created <hi>Kaimecam</hi> of <hi>Constantinople. Mahomet</hi> judg'd that this man being a Person of great fame as well for his own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and virtue, as in regard of his Father and Brother, who were <hi>Viziers,</hi> but much more for being the <hi>Chiaus Bacha</hi>'s Kinsman, his Wife being <hi>Mustafa</hi>'s Sister, he would be the most proper man to divert the Imminent Mischiefs, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the tumults of the insulting Militia: Insomuch that being come to <hi>Constantinople</hi> on the 22d. of <hi>October</hi> in the night, he repaired the next day to the <hi>Serraglio,</hi> and was declared and invested by the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> with the <hi>Employ</hi> of <hi>Kaimecam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 4th. Ditto in the Morning was held a Councill, at which time there entred into the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s <hi>Serraglio,</hi> the <hi>Mufti,</hi> the <hi>Kaimecam, Nachib Effendi,</hi> or <hi>Chief</hi> of the <hi>Green-Heads,</hi> the two <hi>Coodeleskiths,</hi> and four other Old Preachers, or Scheyhs. There they consulted with all Secresy of the Course they should take to repress the Insolency of the Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Soldiers, but none had the Boldness to speak freely, as not trusting one another, but fearing that having given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitting Council to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> some Partizan of the Troups would reveal it to the Army, and so they might draw their own Ruine upon their Heads: All knowing, that People arm'd without Law and Authority, give themselves a loose into all manner of Injustice, and Woe be to him that does at that time provoke their anger. Whereupon it was concluded on by a Common Consent, that considering the present po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of Affairs, the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> had not sufficient Power to suppress the Military Arrogancy, and that therefore the most Efficacious Course was Dissimulation, using all means to quiet and lull them asleep, in order to which there was not any more powerfull potion than Gold, and the blood of those whom they esteem'd their Adversaries. This Opinion being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> to begin the Execution of it, did two hours after send the <hi>Chiaus Pachi</hi> to the Gate-house of the middle of the <hi>Serraglio,</hi> where <hi>Soliman Pacha</hi> was imprisoned,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48635:7"/>
and who the day after <hi>Regebs</hi> flight, was taken by the <hi>Bostangi Pachi</hi> in his own house, upon the Canal of the <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> and put into the Gate-house of the middle of the <hi>Serraglio,</hi> with order to take off his head. As soon as <hi>Soliman</hi> saw the <hi>Chiaus Pachi: I know</hi> said he, <hi>to what purpose you are come, but the Will of God be done; I have wash'd, but I have not said my Prayers,</hi> and then going into a Withdrawing Room, and having said his Prayers, he did anew call the <hi>Chiaus Pachi</hi>; who had been his Creature, and weeping told him: <hi>My Hands shall be upon the<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in the Day of Iudgment, if with all Sincerity thou dost not acquaint the</hi> Grand Signior <hi>with the things I have to tell thee: The first is, that all my Slaves both Males and Females are Free, and I declare I have given them full and total Liberty: The other, that my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants be not Tortur'd to discover my Wealth, because I protest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the face of God never to have been a Man of much Money, and the little I had was left a Prey to the Soldiers in my Tent, when I made my escape from the Camp: True, indeed, that in my House in</hi> Scutary, <hi>I have some pretty things, but of no great value, which I humbly beseech the</hi> Grand Signior <hi>that he would vouchsafe to leave to my Son, if out of his Clemency he should not think fitting to conv<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> them to his own use, in which case he is absolute Master: And this is all I desire thee to tell:</hi> And having said this, he turn'd his face to the Wall &amp; bid the <hi>Chiaus</hi> do his Office, and then was strangled and his Head being cut from his Body, was carried to the <hi>Kaimecam's</hi> House, and from thence to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> who the day following sent it by the <hi>Nassachi Agosi</hi> to the Army, further offering them the Heads of all those they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, even those of his own Sons: Promising likewise to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy them in all their Pay behind-hand, which was about fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Months, and to augment it, and give them a Donative, as if he was a New Emperour, and to this purpose sent them four thousand Purses, each containing above five hundred Dollars, to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> in case they would stay there, esteeming that place convenient and befitting to Winter in, both for that it abounds in all things, as also that it lay near to take the Field again in the Spring. The <hi>Grand Signior</hi> did too much dread the coming of the Army to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> knowing the great Dammage, that must thence ensue; seeing that but some
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48635:8"/>
days before the bare suspicion conceived by the People, that some Troups had entred the City in the Night time, and that the remaining part of the Army was at hand did in a trice Occasion all the shops to be shut up; but these fears imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately vanished, because that <hi>Nissangek Pacha</hi> was forthwith dispatcht throughout the whole City and proclam'd that on pain of Death they should all keep open their shops.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the Soldiers did not shew themselves any wise pacified with the satisfactions given them by the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>; and as concerning that of <hi>Solimans</hi> Death, they openly cry'd, that they had not in the least required his head, but that they aim'd at having him alive in their hands, to make him give an Exact Account of the Moneys Leavied the last year for the Service of the War, and wherein he had consum'd them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Nassachi,</hi> that return'd from the Army with their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, found that the <hi>Kislar-Aga</hi> was imprison'd in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and that in his stead <hi>Ali-Aga</hi> was made <hi>Kasnadar.</hi> In like manner the <hi>Bostangi Pachi</hi> was taken into Custody, and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to have the superintendency of that Employ. There were also imprison'd the <hi>Seigmen Pachi,</hi> or <hi>Ianizar-Aga,</hi> the <hi>Tefterdar,</hi> with whom were likewise the Empresses <hi>Chiaus</hi> and <hi>Steward,</hi> the <hi>Moxur Aga,</hi> the Chief <hi>Tekragu, Stanni Effendi, Casan Elebi</hi> intendant of the <hi>Arsenal, Ornar Aga, Regebs Kiaia Giaban Age,</hi> or Chief Commissioner of the Customs, who was imprison'd the day of <hi>Regebs</hi> flight; and then tormented to reveal the Treasure and the place where he had hid it; And all these were sent to the Army, by whom they were clapt under Arrest, but the <hi>Bostangi Pachi,</hi> and the <hi>Seigmen Pachi</hi> were set again at Liberty, the former being further sent <hi>Pacha</hi> to <hi>Metelino,</hi> and the second for <hi>Seraskier</hi> against the <hi>Venetians</hi> in the <hi>Morea.</hi> Nay and the <hi>Mokur Aga</hi> was sent to command the <hi>Ianizaries</hi> in <hi>Candia,</hi> and all this was done by the Armies order. But the freeing the <hi>Kizlar-Aga</hi> was not with the Consent of the Souldiers, but of the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> own Motion, though Condemn'd to pay three hundred Purses, and all the Estate he had in <hi>Constantinople</hi> to be confiscated. He took his march for <hi>AEgypt</hi> where he possessed vast Riches, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been in that Employ for 18 Years together in which time
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48635:8"/>
he always stood possess'd of the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> favour, who suffer'd himself to be govern'd by him more than by any other Minister, insomuch that all the <hi>Visirs</hi> and <hi>Fachas</hi> caress'd and presented him to be in his favour.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> on the 22th of <hi>October</hi> was resolved to put Policy upon the stretch, and like a Candle that is ready to go out, he tryed the most efficacious means to revive the Blaze of his decaying Authority; for that reflecting, but too late, that he was depriv'd of his most trusty Ministers and Confidents, and surrounded by those that were assign'd him by the Army, and that all the means he had rais'd, to satisfy the Militia, did in no wise avail but render'd them bolder than ever, he came at Midnight into <hi>Constantinople.</hi> He at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the Cunningest stratagem to fix himself by main force in the Throne, even to the shame of angry fortune, and feigning to know it to be impossible to maintain himself in the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial seat, He askt to speak with his Brother <hi>Soliman,</hi> giving to understand that he meant to recommend his Sons to him, seeing it became him to give way to the force of his Destiny; but nevertheless under this fiction he foster'd a resolute Spirit to take away his own Sons and Brothers Lives, that so the Army might be compell'd to continue him at the Helm, there being no others of the Imperial Line. But the <hi>Bostangi Pachi</hi> and <hi>Kizlar-Aga</hi> conceived some suspicion of this matter, and immediately made the <hi>Kaimecam</hi> acquainted with it, who coming instantly ordered the <hi>Giuka Aga</hi> to go into the streets near the Wall of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and admonished the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> not to make any Attempt against his own Blood, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear giving any suspicion, by seeking to enter into the Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Sons and Brother, because that the <hi>Ianizaries</hi> had surrounded the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and would surprize him if he did not remain quiet. This Enterprize being also thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, he found himself Excluded from all means of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining himself in the Sovereign Degree.</p>
            <p>But now was the hour come that he was to Experience the Vicissitudes of Humanity, passing from the Possession of a vast Empire to the narrow Compass of four Walls, and the first storke that presag'd the effect, was his being given to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48635:9"/>
understand that his Sons were taken from him and put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a safe Guard, with the greater security to cooperate for the Brothers safety. Then he more evidently knew it when he saw himself under Confinement, the <hi>Bostangi Pachi</hi> having Express order from the <hi>Kaimecam,</hi> not to suffer him to enter into a Boat, nor so much as to stir out without his first being made acquainted with it. Thus was the Unfortunate <hi>Grand Signior</hi> penn'd up in the <hi>Serrail,</hi> without having other Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his tormenting Circumstances, than a harsh Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his pass'd Grandeurs, which serv'd the more to rack him: He repair'd often to a <hi>Kiosch</hi> upon the Sea-shore under the Wall of the <hi>Serrail,</hi> to divert himfelf a little from the Melancholly thoughts which possessed his Mind. In the mean while his Greatnesses terminated on the 29th of <hi>October,</hi> and upon his Ruines his Brother <hi>Soliman</hi> laid the first founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his felicities.</p>
            <p>The Army was come within two days journey to <hi>Ponte-Grand,</hi> and at Midnight entred <hi>Chiabeck,</hi> where the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-General of the <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> with ten Companies of that <hi>Militia,</hi> study'd to bring about the alteration, without any Hurly-Burly in the City or <hi>Serrail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean while, the <hi>Bostandgi Pacha,</hi> and the <hi>Kizlar-Aga</hi> repair'd about Midnight to the <hi>Grand Signior Mahomet,</hi> in pursuance of the orders they had received of putting him into safe Custody. He in great Confusion knew not what answer to make, but that he did not know of his having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any Errour, by which he might merit such a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; to which the Ministers reply'd, that he should call to mind, that he had reigned forty years and upwards, and that this ought to suffice him, being the Course of a Man's Life.</p>
            <p>Before day the <hi>Kaimecam, Mufti, Caydelesker,</hi> and some Principal Persons of the Law, re-assembled at St. <hi>Sophia,</hi> and having performed their morning Devotions, at the first Dawn of day they sent the <hi>Chiaus-Pachi</hi> to the <hi>Serrail,</hi> and followed him: As <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oon as they were admitted, they required <hi>Sultan Soliman,</hi> who being brought forth was immediately placed upon the Throne, auguring him all manner of feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and that God would bless his undertakings for the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48635:9"/>
Honour and Weal of the Empire. He upon so great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected tydings was not at all ruffled or chang'd; but with great Modesty and Humility laying his hand upon his Breast bowed down, and in few words render'd them thanks, and they thus leaving him went their ways, and at three a Clock in the Afternoon he was proclaimed Emperour thronghout all the parts of the City. It is a matter Worthy of Reflection, that a few Squadrons of Mutinous Soldiers should be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to bring about the Changing of an Emperour by so long a train of years rooted in the Command of so great and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous a City, without the least Combustion or Disorder, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending such a Revolution, and without meeting Opposition and Resistance; and this case seems to renew the ancient practise of the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiery, who at their pleasure Elected their Emperours, and by barely appearing at the Walls of <hi>Rome,</hi> forc'd the People to concurr with their Opinion. But however, he that shall consider the consternation, under which People labour'd in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> will have little Room for Wonder, that they had so quietly suffered the totall Topsy-Turveying of the Monarchy, because that their minds being dejected by continual advices of unhappy Successes, and their Persons terrify'd with the Presence of armed Soldiers, they had neither means nor forces to oppose themselves against the Current of these respective Events. And besides, the People hoping to change fortune with the shifting of Persons, did the more easily comply with the New Government. Moreover the Ministers proceeded with a prudent Cautiousness in the Exaltation of the New Emperour, not staying for all the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery to come into the City, whence would have ensued most heavy Inconveniences, and of considerable Prejudice, if the Military Insolence had had the honour of solely advancing <hi>Soliman</hi> to the Commands.</p>
            <p>Its thought that the Deposed's Life will be but very short, by reason of it's being the usual Custom of that Nation to step out of Prisons into the Grave, as allso because that <hi>Mahomet</hi> being for so many years accustomed to Pastimes, to the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of Hunting, and to Riding dayly, and what is more to Government, could very ill brook to see himself clapt-up in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48635:10"/>
a Chamber, deprived of all Recreation and Authority, whence he must in a short time be conveyed to his Tomb, altho' his Death should not be hastned by the new <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> Command.</p>
            <p>On the 31th of <hi>October</hi> the <hi>Kaimecam,</hi> and all the Great Personnages went to meet the <hi>Vizir,</hi> accompanying him two Miles from the City. The <hi>Chiaus-Pachi</hi> was secured by the Soldiers, and in his stead was elected the Person that had the same Employ about the <hi>Vizir.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the first of <hi>November</hi> the <hi>Vizir</hi> made his Solemn Entry into <hi>Constantinople,</hi> accompanied by a Cavalcade of all the Great Men Military and Civil, and on his Left hand rid the <hi>Mufty,</hi> and in this manner repaired to the <hi>Serrail,</hi> delivering up to the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> the Seal and Prophets Standard, from whom he received a new Seal with his own name.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, the <hi>Spahies</hi> and <hi>Ianizaries</hi> assembled in the <hi>Hippodrome</hi> and <hi>Meidan,</hi> requiring the Heads of their Eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, their Pays and other Dues. The Former were in the <hi>Hippodrome</hi> and the Latter in the <hi>Meidan,</hi> and they all demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>Regeb</hi> the late <hi>Kaimecam</hi> should be put alive into their hands, but prevail'd not. He was indeed strangled in Prison, and his Body Exposed upon the Place of St. <hi>Sophia</hi> before the great Gate of the <hi>Serrail</hi> upon an old Matt untill the Morning of the sixth day, and then it was removed. This was a great Man both for his Capacity and Courage, and if the Deposed <hi>Sultan</hi> had listned to his Persuasions, he would either have continued upon the Throne, or at least made his fall a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Enterprize by some Act of Generosity.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Regebs</hi> Death one <hi>Cochiuc Mehomet</hi> a Ring-leader of the Mutinous <hi>Spahies,</hi> endeavoured to persuade the Soldiers to be quiet, and content themselves with three Pays instead of five; This man had indeed great Authority among the Soldiers, nay more than the <hi>Vizir</hi> himself, and because great Persons sent him rich Regales, and that he dwelt in a Sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Palace, went abroad in a Magnificent Garb, and rode about with a Guard of Armed Men, these things made the Soldiers jealous that he was corrupted with Moneys, and at their cost procured his own Greatness; wherefore towards
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48635:10"/>
the Evening the Soldiery went to find him out in his own Pallace, and meeting him with slaves and knives miserably killed him.</p>
            <p>There is some appearance, that the <hi>Spahies</hi> and <hi>Ianizaries</hi> will jump in Accord with what concerns their own Interest, but nevertheless are not really united. However the <hi>Vizir</hi> to pacify them, promis'd to give them all their Pays that were owing to them, and that on the 8th of the same Month they should certainly be satisfied; but this not being performed, they were forced to deferr the Solemn repairing of the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> to the <hi>Mosch</hi> of <hi>Iup,</hi> for the receiving from <hi>Nachib Effendi</hi> Chief of the Green-Heads, or the true Off-spring of the Prophet, the Sword with which he had been lately girt. This Pomp was appointed to be on the <hi>Fryday,</hi> but if Moneys be not to be found out to satisfy the Militia, they, thinking they are impos'd upon, will occasion new Tumults.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the Soldiers would not suffer the Prey of <hi>Kizlar-Aga</hi> to escape out of their hands, He having been freed by the deposed <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and was going for <hi>Cairo.</hi> For they dispatcht some after him to seize him, &amp; having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken him at <hi>Nicea,</hi> the Eunuch <hi>Capigi Pachi,</hi> had not the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to attacque him, as having 200. Persons with him; but having united the Country People, they enclos'd him on all sides, and so being taken Prisoner by the Souldiers, they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him Prisoner to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where he will certainly in a short time be beheaded; in the Interim they have made him Confess where he hid all his Wealth, knowing him to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Rich.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the late <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> has anew besought the Emperour to grant him the Company of his Sons, and he is indulg'd in his Request, they all being in the very Apartment where for so many Years, the same <hi>Soliman</hi> was confined in the <hi>Serrail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So short a space will not allow Us to pass a Judgment on this Emperours Inclinations; We know indeed that having for so many Years been us'd to study and the reading of Books, he has levell'd his Genius that way; Whence he would make a better Master of a School than a Head of Armies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:48635:11"/>His Mother was removed from the <hi>Old-Serrail,</hi> where she has allwaies been kept from the time of <hi>Sultan-Ibrahims</hi> Death to the <hi>Grand-Serrail,</hi> to participate in the Honours and felicities of her Son, and she is <hi>Valide</hi>; but she is said to be crackbrain'd.</p>
            <p>We since understand by the Letters of the 26th of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> that Tumults had ensued between the <hi>Spahies</hi> and the <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries,</hi> who joyntly refus'd to receive the Pays, without the usuall Donative of the new Emperour; but the Scarceness of the publick money, by the Exchequers being wholly Exhaust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, occasion'd no small Difficulties.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ianizaries</hi> being discontented with their <hi>Aga,</hi> turn'd him off, and requiring, as has been Customary in former times, a <hi>Ianizary-Aga</hi> out of the <hi>Serrail,</hi> the <hi>Scelicter</hi> was put into that Station, a Man in no wise fitted for the Dignity, having ever been shut up in that <hi>Serrail,</hi> and of no Practise in Military matters: but this was much for their purpose, desiring to have a head that had need of being rul'd by them, and not they commanded by him.</p>
            <p>These to provide themselves with money, sent for the Principall Commanders, who are four, of that Cursed Crew, and they Sess'd severall Persons some a hundred Thousand, some fifty thousand Realls, according to each mans means, and made use of their Houses for the Quartering of Soldiers at Discretion, untill they had fulfill'd the Payment of the Summs prescrib'd.</p>
            <p>In other matters the Concerns of the Soldiery go on quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the Reigning <hi>Grand Signior</hi> went on the 7th to the Mosch of <hi>Iup,</hi> in order to the being Solemnly girt, as has been said, with the Sword of <hi>Nachib-Effendi,</hi> and chief of the Green-heads, which is the Equivalent of a Coronation.</p>
            <p>The four Chiefs of the Mutinous Soldiers, leading the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,</hi> as it were, in a string, do truly command the <hi>Visir,</hi> without his being able to contradict them in any thing, their Insolence owning no other Authority then their own pleasure.</p>
            <p>After the so many foremention'd Butcheries, there follow'd not any shedding of Bloud, save only that of <hi>Lokiuk Mahomet,</hi> their Principall Commander, out of a suspition of his being corrupted with the money of the <hi>Serrail</hi>: and that of the poor
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48635:11"/>
               <hi>Regeb Kaimecam,</hi> who was strangled, (as was before related.) He that fled towards <hi>Cairo</hi> is imprison'd in the Seaven Towers, and they have despoil'd him of all his Wealth, but it is not known who will Succeed him.</p>
            <p>The Reigning <hi>Grand Signior</hi> has prevail'd for the life of the new <hi>Kizlar-Aga,</hi> he having got his Redemption by dibur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a hundred thosand Realls; the like befalling all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the deposed <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> by whose favour having enrich'd themselves, they must now buy their Lives at a Dear rate.</p>
            <p>The new <hi>Kaimecam Mustapha Bacha Kiuperli</hi> is the favourite of the present Emperour, who has declar'd himself that he would not take away the Life of his deposed Brother, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he should be kept as he himself had been.</p>
            <p>They are now in hopes of enjoying Tranquility in <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble,</hi> for that the Soldiers having receiv'd all their paies, if they do not harbour other perverse Designs, they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their own homes: the greatest pressure they labour under it present is, to find out Money sufficient for the Ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Campaign, giving out that the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> will go in Person to the War, and will Assemble his Army in <hi>Adrianople.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Great Reformations have been made in the Expences of the <hi>Serrail,</hi> calculating that they have spared a Million of Reals for this year; because that this <hi>Grand Signior</hi> is not used to the Luxuries of the Court, and pretends to govern wholly in Conformity to the Laws, and the Writ his Mother make's not any figure in the Court.</p>
            <p>Since these Occurrences we have Letters of the 17th. of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> in which we have the Confirmation of all before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, assuring us that there had not only ensued the slaughter of all the Ministers of the deposed <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> but likewise that all those of his Party are slain, and their estates confisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the management of the Government being left to the new <hi>Kaimecam,</hi> and his Kinsman <hi>Chiaus Grand Vizier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They further advise us of the frequent sitting of the <hi>Divan</hi> to consult about the means of furnishing to the Occasions of the ensuing Campagne. The truth is that they have been hamper'd afresh by the tumults of the Soldiery, part of whom
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48635:12"/>
still adherr'd to the deposed <hi>Sultan,</hi> whence they have judg'd it a prudent Resolution to Separate the Peaceable from the Tumultuous, whereupon a number of the Militia were tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported into <hi>Asia,</hi> and thus the Hurly-Burlies were a little allay'd and quieted. After which the <hi>Divan</hi> came to a Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of utterly abandoning the thoughts of <hi>Hungary,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there were no hopes of keeping it, thinking it sufficient to send some Troups for the defence of <hi>Belgrade,</hi> and the neighbouring Places, contriving to unite the whole strength of the Soldiery under the <hi>Grand Vizier,</hi> and send him to <hi>Negro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont</hi> to maintain that Country, which much more conduces to the advantage of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, and at the same time the <hi>Tartars</hi> should with their own forces oppose the <hi>Muscovites</hi> and <hi>Poles,</hi> as they had done in the late Campaign.</p>
            <p>But these Resolutions were quite interrupted by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a <hi>Tartarian</hi> Envoy, at the same time dispatcht by the <hi>Cham</hi> of the <hi>Crim Tartars,</hi> who in the name of his Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented to the Port; that the <hi>Tartars</hi> ever constant in their fidelity and good Correspondence with <hi>Turkey,</hi> had at all times exerted their Affection, even at the Cost of their Lives and fortunes. That they had the last Campagne by artifices delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the formidable forces of the <hi>Muscovites</hi> and <hi>Poles,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out suffering them to gain any Advantage over the Countrys that are at the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> Devotion. But that is for the ensuing Campaign, they know it impossible for them to make Resistance against the great Military Preparations, that were making by those two forementioned Potentates, in case they were not assisted by the <hi>Port</hi> with notable Succours of men and money.</p>
            <p>This Seemed a Thunder-bolt, that put the <hi>Divan</hi> into the utmost fright, Insomuch they were all <hi>Nonplust</hi> and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion at this unexpected proposall. Wherefore they alter'd all the Resolutions they had allready taken, and made new Projects more sutable to the present Exigency, some Ministers urg'd that it would be a mighty help to dispatch Ministers to the <hi>Christian</hi> Potentates &amp; Allies and by any means to procure Peace. That they should send a blank signed Paper to <hi>Poland</hi>; that so that Crown laying hold of so great an Advantage,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48635:12"/>
might serve for a means to quiet the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> though not give Peace; and 'tis thought this opinion may prevail; thus we expect what Resolution they will six upon; because that the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Monarchy is certainly at present like to a man in great danger of being cast away, and who to save himself catches hold on the very Briars. Thus it will strike in with any Course, though Disadvantageous, so as that it but tends to re-feat it, and buoy it up amid the Tempests that toss it at present.</p>

            <p>WHoever lives toss'd amid the Tempests of unhappy Successes, has not any other Glimmering left of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Light, save the hopes of getting at the long run out of those Intricate Labrinths of Misery by the thrid either of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Resolutions, or of precipitous Attempts. In the <hi>Diluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of the late Commotions of <hi>Turkey,</hi> we left the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Ministers busy in providing means to procure a Peace with the Confedrated Princes, as the scope of all their Desires, and this not speeding, to make ready all the forces possible; to stem and make a Bank against the Current of the Catholick Victories, which being more then ever aggrandiz'd by vast Additions of Troups and Warlike Preparations, they fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw were likely to Seize the nighest and most Important Places of their Dominions. And after the manner of expert Physicians knowing that is is in vain to apply Remedies to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Distempers, when the inward and Principall parts are infected, they attempted to purge <hi>Constantinople</hi> of the Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48635:13"/>
Soldiers, and giving them entire satisfaction in all their paies besides opulent Donations, they remanded the <hi>Asiaticks</hi> with all their Leaders to their own Homes. But because that every bettering of a distemper'd Person is ascrib'd by Persons concerned for a sure Prognostick of restored health, the <hi>Turks</hi> thought to have enjoyed most peaceably the new Government, being allured by a momentaneous Serene of Quiet, because that the <hi>Asiaticks</hi> being separated from the <hi>Europeans,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all the <hi>Spahies</hi> dismiss'd, they had hopes that the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the Army would peaceably attend the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior's</hi> orders, and march for such Places as should be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the ensuing Campagne. But they do not consider, that when they do not utterly root out the Distemper, every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of health, serves only to brood more pernitious ills, and more dangerous Relapses. For Six Chieftains of the Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Troups being left in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> one Chieftain and two Assistants for the White Banner, and the like for the Red, and likewise four hundred <hi>Bolakhaski,</hi> or Captains, two hundred for one Party and two hundred for T'other, these pretended that the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> ought to own the aggrandizement of his fortune to them, aiming to regulate the Government accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their own sence and pleasure, without ackowledging either the Superintendency of the Ministers, or the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Emperour, and mingling the Profession of Arms with the Exercise of managing the affairs of the City, they fram'd out and demized the publick Revenues with an Intention, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, of Exacting from but of never satisfying the Prince. They went to Audience of the <hi>Vizir</hi> with their Swords by their sides, in a posture rather of Commanding than of representing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, and in short would needs be Judges of all the most Important affairs of the Monarchy.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vizir</hi> durst not openly oppose himself against the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity of the Mutiniers, the Example of the preceding Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters miserably butcher'd by the Soldiers serving him for a rule to square his measures by, he made a shew of condescend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all their Demands; but it is not known whether out of an Intention of lulling them asleep, that he might afterwards sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize them unprovided, and overwhelme them with a blow, so
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48635:13"/>
much the heavier as it was Unexpected, or through the faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Spirit, or the want of artifices and evasion, being a man absolutely void of the knowledge of Letters, and so forc'd basely to submit to the Will and Pleasure of a few Soldiers, fearing perhaps that as their tumults had rais'd his fortune, the same means would bring his ruine. Certain it is that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto he has not given the least Instance of a Polititian, nor of a man vers'd in publick Concerns, some further questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning whether in the Soveraign Command of the Armies he is like to Speed better than he has hitherto done in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall Administrations; But time which unfolds all will f<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make known the effect of these suppositions. True it is that the giving way so easily to a few Youths rais'd from an abject Condition, to some fortune, by the Infamous means of Rebellion, is the Maxim of Cowardly Men, when they will not confess, that they themselves having likewise by the same ways obtain'd their Employ cannot shew ends different from the means which serv'd them for their Agrandizement.</p>
            <p>And because among all the weighty Considerations which the <hi>Port</hi> may have at present, the principal is to accumulate Moneys by all manner of means, as being the main Nerve of Armies, and the securest way to remove all Turbulencies, by sending the Soldiery away, hence it came that instead of shedding the Bloud of those they deemed worthy of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they now squeez them of their Gold; and because the <hi>Kizlar-Aga,</hi> who as we said in our foregoing <hi>Dilucidation,</hi> had been Imprison'd in the Seaven Towers, he was freed thence, being nevertheless bound to pay to the Publick Five hundred thousand Crowns, besides vast Sums disburst to the Ministers for the obtaining his Delivery. It was no difficult matter for him to find out so many Sums of Money, because that having been, as has been said, so many Years in Possession of that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, and what is more in the Deposed <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> favour, he had heap'd up infinite Treasures, and principally in <hi>AEgypt</hi> he had made Acquisitions of vast Territories, and therefore being now made free he took a journey by Land towards <hi>Cairo.</hi> Nor had <hi>Ali Aga Asnadar,</hi> who was the formers Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor, any better fortune, seeing he was likewise compell'd
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48635:14"/>
to redeem his own Life with the disbursement of a hundred thousand Crowns, and likewise with his repairing to <hi>Cairo</hi> by Sea having left as Successor in his Employ the <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Old Serrail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There went likewise for <hi>Cairo</hi> the <hi>Selectar,</hi> or Sword-Bearer of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> having been appointed by the Court for <hi>Pacha</hi> of those Countreys, and it is reported that for the making that Voyage he had hired two <hi>French</hi> Ships for <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and that further from the Ambassador and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of the said Nation he had borrowed a hundred and fifty Purses, yet with depositing Pledges proportionable, which were to remain on board till such time as that the said Moneys were fully paid in <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Life of the degraded <hi>Grand Signior</hi> seems to give no small suspicion to <hi>Soliman's</hi> Ministers, as Persons that have a Prospect of the Progress of their Fortunes from upholding the New Emperour. Besides they have insinuated into him that he should not grant <hi>Mahomet</hi> the favour of the Physicians he requir'd, to cure the Indisposition of his Legs, that were very much Swoln, and to open anew certain parts that had been cut, all having proceeded from a Totall Change of this Princes way of Living, seeing now he is forc'd to remain penn'd up in a Chamber without any manner of Diversion whatever, whereas before by the Exercizes of Riding and Hunting, he was, as it were, in continual Motion. And to palliate this Act of Barbarity, they have persuaded him to answer his Brother: that as for his own part he would most willingly cooperate in all things to his satisfaction, and should chiefly desire to see him recovered from his Indispositions, under which he labours,, if he was sure he should be freed from the Distemper; but that the Cure being uncertain, and there being no security that the Physicians will be helpfull to him, he will not incurr the Blame of having occasion'd, nay procur'd his Death; and that this he look'd upon as a necessary Result, well-knowing that the People would suspect, and with reason, that he under the pretext of having him Cured would procure his Death by Contrary Medicines. In the mean while, he supported (with a Constancy worthy of him) the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48635:14"/>
Malady, praying God (in whose hands is the Life and Death of Men) that he would grant him perfect Health: and with this feign'd Pretext denied the poor Prince so just a demand.</p>
            <p>This notwithstanding, there are not wanting Adherents to <hi>Mahomet</hi> that breath after the reprocuring him his lost Estate, and there are Others that propose it as a matter more Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to advance his Son to the Throne, giving out, that <hi>Soliman</hi> being alltogether inexpert in Government, by having through the whole space of his Life been confin'd to a Chamber, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing the Maxims, which ought to concur for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishing a fortunate Monarchy, and without experience of politique Management, from which every Body of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy receives its Spirit and Vigour. And then the seeing him far from <hi>Veneriall</hi> Inclinations, by having reform'd the <hi>Serails</hi> of the Women, under colour of taking away superfluous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, makes them believe that as he promises little ability for the Establishment of the Empire, so he affords no great prospect of giving a Succession of Progeny, so necessary to Monarchs.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless the Concerns of the new Government are far from being well settled; Nay they give less hopes than ever of continuing in any good posture; for there are three Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on foot, the first for the Reigning <hi>Soliman,</hi> the second for the deposed <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and the third for his Son, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his one and twentith year of Age seems much more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable than the others to receive the Crown; because that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> who was lately shoulder'd out of the Throne, will very hardly be plac'd again in his former station, seeing this will never be assented unto by those, that have been the Occasion of his being depos'd, with justice suspecting, that being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd anew to the Helme, he will aim at securing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the Dignity, by laying the foundations of his establishment upon the Carcasses of his Adversaries. Now <hi>Soliman</hi> being as it were deprived of the Spirit, Vigour and Capacity requisite for the ruling such a Monarchy, by having been bury'd in the Sloth of so long an Imprisonment, has neither the Age nor Capacity to learn those Maxims, which Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a reall Emperour, seeing by that time he can get infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48635:15"/>
and insight into those matters, he must through old Age leave the Helm together with his Life. Thus the only hopes remain in <hi>Mahomets</hi> Son, a Sprightfull youth, fit to receive all Impression as well of a Martiall as a Politique Prince.</p>
            <p>The very People, though such as ought not to be medling in matters of Empire, discourse things conformably as they are directed by their Desire or Inclinations: Giving out, that the <hi>Vizier,</hi> to give some essays of his valour and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire merit with the Port, will go into the <hi>Morea</hi> the ensuing Campegne, with Armies of between forty and fifty thousand Soldiers, with a Prospect of recovering that Realm, and of Signalizing his Name by setting anew in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Crown the precious Gem of that lost Kingdom. That for this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the <hi>Capigi Pachi</hi> was dispatcht to <hi>Algiers</hi> to let them know that the Port would assign them ten of its ships, that so being united to those of that Republique, the <hi>Algerines</hi> might make head against the <hi>Naval</hi> Power of the <hi>Venetians.</hi> But as these Particularities are not grounded on an evident Certainty they give Occasion to our suspending our totall Belief, expecting that the Benefit of time will Clear the event of such like Reports. Besides there is great Probability that the <hi>Turk</hi> will, in the Ensuing Campagne, bring greater Forces against the <hi>Republick</hi> than they did the year before.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the Ministers of the <hi>Port</hi> put their wits upon the stretch to find means to raise money, making Diligent Enquiry into all Peoples Estates, and after for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures, and such as may be liable to fines and Confiscations, that so by such means they may furnish the things Necessary for the Ensuing Campaign, yet all Contrivances of this kind falling short, for that the Insolency of the mutinous Soldiers having quite drained the Exchequer, and gorg'd a great part of the Revenues belonging to the publick, the <hi>Vizier</hi> tryed one method which made him absolutely incur the <hi>Odium</hi> of the Soldiery, and finally drew on his Ruine. Certain publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues were assign'd for the Soldiers which the <hi>Vizier</hi> advis'd to be stop'd and detain'd, therewith to supply the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Occasions, thus despairing the Soldiery of their Security of being satisfi'd as to their Arriers. The other Ministers propos'd that in imitation of what had been done at other
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48635:15"/>
times, when the Prince had labour'd under a want of money, and that he had no other way to be furnish'd, that a Tax of a <hi>Zecchin</hi> should be laid upon each firehearth of <hi>Constantinolpe, Bursia</hi> &amp; <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anople,</hi> nevertheless only taxing the <hi>Turks</hi> Chimneys, not those of the <hi>Christians,</hi> because that the latter having been burdened with other manifold Impositions, they had not wherewithall to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer this new Leavy. But the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> being beseig'd on all sides with Distress and Penury, did absolutely deny to assent thereunto; because that the interruption of all Trade and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with so many parts of <hi>Europe</hi> had more than a little dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd their Gains and Incomes, and the temerity of the muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers had made them contribute large Summs beyond what was customary, and besides the methods to augment the Burdens of Subjects, afflicted on all Parts, are not so easy to practise, when they do not perceive that such Courses redound to their Benefit, either in securing their Commerce, or defending their Religion, their Estates, substance and goods from Enemies and Seducers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whence seeing that so many sums that had been exacted had been converted to the Benefit of a few Mutiniers, and the publick drain'd and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted to pamper and fatten private Persons, nay &amp; the very Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the common weal &amp; quiet, it is not to be wonder'd at if the People assess'd did so openly declare that they neither could nor would assent thereunto. Thus was the Execution of that Decree sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, Employing the Moneys they had in sending Men and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions to <hi>Negrepont</hi> &amp; <hi>Canea,</hi> &amp; to make the Necessary Preparations for the fitting out the Fleet, consisting in forty three <hi>Fusts</hi> and <hi>Briganties,</hi> and one Galley, which they built, Twenty of the said Vessells being now in a readiness, the speedy Equipping of the rest are recommended to the Ministers upon severe Penalties of Non-Performance, the Publique Cry being that the aforesaid forces ought to be Employ'd to secure the <hi>Black-Sea,</hi> from the pinching Invasions of the <hi>Cossacks,</hi> who continually scouring that Sea occasion'd infinite Damage, as well to Commerce, as more particularly to all Commodities that furnish'd to the Maintainance of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> And the more to quicken and spirit the People to Contributions, and to Encourage the Soldiery, the <hi>Sultan</hi> had given order for the setting up the Horses Tails, by them call'd <hi>To<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

repair to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> reporting at the same time that he was to send &amp; go along with the greater part of the forces into the <hi>Morea,</hi> leaving the Residue for the Defence of <hi>Belgrade,</hi> and that little of <hi>Hungary</hi> they have remaining. But the Accidents which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ensued, broke to pieces these Resolutions, having given clearly to understand, that the tolerating the Insolencies of the Rebellious, without Punishment, was the flushing them still to commit greater, in hopes of coming off still at the same rate. In the mean while, the Immoderate Pretensions of those Rebellious Officers at <hi>Constantinople</hi> did daily encrease, who not contented with seeing under their feet the <hi>Sultans</hi> Supreme Authority, and that of the Principal Ministers, wresting the Government con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably to their Interest or Caprice, but would needs be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually the Abettors of Innovations, whence the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> coming at length to know that he had foster'd and nested a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in his Bosom, that would at the long run deprive him of his Life, and that the any longer tolerating the temerity of those, was to shew himself utterly deprived of Authority, and in a worse Condition than his very Subjects, seeing he suffer'd himself to be rul'd at their Will and Pleasure, he determined upon making use of his Force and Power, seeing Reason had not sufficient Light to make known to those Minds, adumbrated by Contumacy, the Duty of Subjects, and the terms wherein they ought to contain themselves; In order to which he commanded the <hi>Ianizary-Aga,</hi> that he should speedily remedy these matters, by Employing Chastisement for the Reducing to due Obedience, such as were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to and would not comply with their Duty. The <hi>Aga,</hi> not willing to hazard himself in acquanting unitely all the Rebells with the supreme order, derived allso from the common Consent of the <hi>Divan,</hi> well knowing that the opposing the Resolute will of the worst People does often lead into those precipitous Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that are the Daughters of Turbulent minds, and alienated their due Obedience, he repair'd to <hi>Fetuaggi</hi> the Rebell-Leader, and shew'd him the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> Decree, endeavouring by all the means of Persuasion to bring him to a sence of his Duty; but he more Insolent than ever, esteem'd a note of Infamy what was only a petty Resentment in respect of his perverse Operations. This Carriage, nevertheless, very much provoking the <hi>Aga,</hi> he commanded his follower to seize the Rebell, but he thinking to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48635:16"/>
find the same faint-heartedness in the Soldiers he had Experienced in the Populacy, he laid his hand to his Sabre, attempting to defend his own Liberty, by hewing his way with Iron through the Midst of those Armed Men, as resting secure that if he should have the luck to get out of their hands, and run into the Midst of his Adherents, he should easily have escap'd all manner of danger: but the effect prov'd contrary, because that being surrounded by the <hi>Aga's</hi> Soldiery, notwithstanding his Resistance, he was cut to pieces, they thus Sacrificing this Infamous Victim to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Publick Repose. In the mean time, the notice of this being brought to the Ears of forty Rebells, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Adherents of the aforesaid <hi>Fettuaggi,</hi> not being sure of their being able alone to remedy the Accident, and take their Revenge for their slain Leader, moreover suspecting that they might possibly be surprized by a greater Multitude, they ran im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the <hi>Meidan,</hi> where the other Rebells were assembled, informing them of what had happen'd, animating them to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain with the most steady Resolutions &amp; the most grievous Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities their Authority, which was threatned with Ruine, unless they made head against and us'd their utmost Endeavours to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint this beginning of Depression then impending. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they resolv'd upon not giving way in the least to the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> Resolutions, but on the contrary more than ever to assert their own Power, ever hoping that <hi>Soliman</hi> having been advanc'd by them to the Dignity of Emperour, and the <hi>Vizier</hi> made to ascend to such an Employ by the means of their Valiant Assistance, would in no wise have forgotten such a Benefit, nor have attempted any Innovation against those People, whom they knew to have as well the forces and means as the Will and Pleasure to give and take away Dignities. The meeting these Rebells being understood by the <hi>Aga,</hi> and thinking with the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> bare name to have pacify'd all the Tumults in a Trice, and that the wanting of a Head would dishearten all the Rest from adventuring upon new Commotions, being so well farther tutor'd aud instructed, as he thought, by the so very fresh Example of <hi>Fettuaggi,</hi> he leapt on Horse-back, repair'd to the <hi>Meidan,</hi> to make them understand publickly the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> Intentions, and the Punishments that menac'd such as should neglect the Execution of his Wills. But the Mutineers temerity did not permit his Publication of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48635:17"/>
Supreme Decrees, but perceiving him to be the Minister appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to correct their temerarious Insolencies, without having any regard to the Personage he represented, or to the figure and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy he bore, they laid hands to their Sabres, made a Miserable slaughter of the <hi>Aga,</hi> and of all such as went about to make any opposition, only leaving such alive as by flight found Protection from their Rage. The truth is, the <hi>Aga</hi> shew'd but little Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, not only in Political matters, but likewise in Military, confirming by so unhappy an End the Prognostick pass'd in our foregoing <hi>Dilucidation,</hi> that he was like to prove a Minister of small Credit, having been ever penn'd up in a <hi>Serrail,</hi> far from all Intrigue and Management, and consequently void of all Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in Affairs either Military or Civill. Wherefore he ought to have been satisfied with having surprized a Rebellious Chief in his own House, and with having sacrific'd him to the Wills of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> without Exposing himself to the fury of an Army in Mutiny, with the bare Attendance of a few Soldiers, well enough knowing that he should be received by the Mutineers as an Enemy, having deprived them of their Leader. But he ought after <hi>Fettuaggi's</hi> Death to have united himself to the <hi>Vizier,</hi> &amp; with a greater nerve of men, and so in the language of main force make the Rebells acquainted with the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> orders, without hazzarding the Supreme Authotity to an Evident Contempt, and his own Life to a Certain Peril. Be it as it will, the Rebells not accounting this Revenge sufficient to attone for the loss they had suffer'd in their Leader, their Stomach and Courage being aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the preseut issue, did esteem it an easy matter to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish their other Meditated Enterprizes. Whereupon being hurry'd with the same fury, they went to the Treasurers House to serve him in the same manner they had done the <hi>Aga</hi>; but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better vers'd in the course that is practis'd of flying from the Encounters of an incens'd Army, having understood the Pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousness of the Soldiery, and the Butchery of the <hi>Aga,</hi> did not suffer himself to be found, meaning to give time opportunity, which probably might afford him a more secure access to his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance abroad. In the mean while their vexation at their being disappointed of venting their Rage upon the Person made them Exercise it upon the House, plundering it with all imaginable fury, and only leaving there the footsteps of an implacable Rage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:48635:17"/>All these Attempts reach'd the <hi>Viziers</hi> Ear, altho' being made cautious by the Perills of others, and besides knowing that the Soldiery stood not well affected to him on the score of the above-mention'd Exaction and Detainment of the Moneys appointed for their pays, and also doubting that they might suspect, that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der issued out by the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> proceeded from his Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, he thought sitting to secure both his House and Person with four Companies of <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> and with three Pieces of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, not being willing to be taken unprovided, being sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inform'd what the fnry of a Mutinous Army may attempt, and truly a Prophet of what was like to ensue; for lie was no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er got home and had caused his Gates and Doors to be lock'd and barr'd with all Diligence, but that the Rebells came thither, and having Surrounded the House, began to try with force to break open the Gates, those within oppos'd them with a Daunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Courage and thus follow'd a fray and Combat, those on one side fighting as being guided by fury, and urg'd on by the hopes of getting a rich Booty, and of Extinguishing with the <hi>Viziers</hi> Bloud, whom they accounted the Abetter of all the Councills ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken against them, the implacable thirst they had of Revenge, and the other side in defence of so great a Minister, and to suppress the Impiety of Rebells to their Prince. The Conflict lasted for many hours in such sort, that on both sides there remained four hundred kill'd, and in those of the <hi>Vizir's</hi> there would not have been wanting Constancy, if they had not had want of Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but being depriv'd of Arrows, Powder and Ball, not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any longer the means to resist so much greater a Multitude, and such too as were provided with all necessaries for a longer Engagement, and for that fearing to remain a prey to such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Enemies, they esteemed it a more advantageous Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to provide for their safety by flight, and having open'd a Gate they made all hast away, abandoning the House with their Patron and Master into the hands of implacable Enemies. The <hi>Vizir</hi> was left alone but not without Military Courage; for see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Soldiers enter his House, valour did not depart his Breast, but he resolv'd to honour his Death, with a Glorious End, sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Life at an Extraordinray Dear Rate to the Enemies, for having made a vast slaughter of them with his Sabre in his hand, being Surrounded by the Multitude, and cover'd with Wounds,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48635:18"/>
he was compell'd to yield to his Destiny, falling Extinguish'd upon a Mountain of the Rebells Carkasses which he had slain with his Right hand. This Minister did manifestly give to understand that tho' <hi>Fortune</hi> had disappointed him of giving Instances of his valour by taking him out of the way before he had had Occasion of engaging in Enterprizes becoming and worthy of his figure and Character, it could not however deprive him of the means of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his worth known at least in Death, thus curing the World of the Conceit that he had not given any token of an Experienc'd Person. And the Truth is, that Dignities acquired by infamous means, do often come to terminate in an end much of the like nature, and those very Persons that are the founders of a Fortune acquired by unjust courses, are often also the Origine of the Ruine of those very People whom they Exalt to the first Honours, and that a Dignity which has not for its Basis Merit and Honour, does easily meet with a Fall, as it easily got its Advancement. Be it as it will, the <hi>Vizier</hi> being thus slain, the Soldiers after having vented their Rage upon his Body, vented their Avarice upon his Goods, plundering his House and carrying away all that was in it. Nor did here their fury stop, but they Exerciz'd their Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity upon the Deceas'ds very Women, despoiling them of all they had, and finally the very little Sons of the Dead <hi>Vizier</hi> were the Innocent Reliques consign'd to the unextinguishable Covetousness of those Perfidious Wretches, seeing that having taken them from the House, they dragg'd them to the Market Place, and at the Price of three hundred <hi>Piastres</hi> sold to a <hi>Turk</hi> those that were the Sons of the First Minister of so great a Monarchy.</p>
            <p>Nor ended here the Military Insolence, but gradually with their Wicked Actions the Rebells boldness being augmented, they Proceeded to Exercise their Barbarities upon the <hi>Grand Siguior's</hi> own Servants, and having the force in their hands, they had a Design in their minds of putting him himself to a most Enormous Torture: In the mean while they kill'd two of their Emperours Querries, as also his <hi>Capigilar,</hi> leaving no means untry'd for the Establishing their Usurp'd Authority upon the common Ruine. The <hi>Grand Signior</hi> being overwhelm'd with so many unhappy Events, void of all Prospect of remedying the present Insolencies, seeing those means, which he had made use of to give Peace to his State, had produc'd so much the more pernicious Tempests, he
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48635:18"/>
was utterly deprived of Councill. He had often thoughts of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling Men that he might with force oppose the stubborness of the Rebellious Soldiers: but as he had neither the Heart to make himself their head, nor the means to make himself obey'd, he laid aside this form as useless and impracticable. Then he was enclin'd to convene the <hi>Divan,</hi> in it to consult about the means of repressing so intollerable a Malep<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rtness, but considering that the Greater part of the Ministers were either taken from him by the Rebells Swords, or distanc'd through the fear of Incurring the like unhappy Exits, neither did he strike in with this Course. But at the long Run suffering himself to be guided more by fear than Courage, and fixing upon the Vilest of all Remedies, namely his Inclination and the Dictates of his own Genius, he caus'd pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to be Expos'd out of his <hi>Serrail</hi> the Standard of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> causing to be proclaim'd, that all those who had any spark of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Obedience should repair <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n ever endeavour to spread in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople.</hi> The truth is, this Resolution taken by the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> was that of an unexperienc'd Person, meaning that Religion should serve for a Buckler to defend his own Authority, and to secure himself from the forces of the Mutinous Soldiery.</p>
            <p>The Relying alone upon the Law when the juncture requires the Chastisement of Rebells arm'd and at war with the force and Power of Justice, and incapable of being reduc'd to a sense of their Duty, otherwise than by the Dint of Iron and open Resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, is to shew, not the Spirit of a warlike Prince, but, the faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedness of a timerous Religious. If <hi>Soliman</hi> could not do, like <hi>Semiramis,</hi> who only with her Royall Presence and with Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull words was able to interupt the Course of a most furious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection made by the People of <hi>Babylon,</hi> because that being a new and green Prince, not advanc'd for his Merits nor in vogue for his Enterprizes, nor having experience or Address in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, but lifted up upon the Throne by Tumultuous Squardrons upon the bare consideration of his Birth, he had not the Credit
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48635:19"/>
to suppress such Sturdy Commotions, he ought at least to have conven'd all the Militia, and arm'd men that had no hand in the tumults and were not infected with Rebellion, and with open force make head against the Mutiniers, making them experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that as they had judg'd him worthy of the Crown, he had a Head to sustain it, and a Spirit to exert his Dignity.</p>
            <p>Yet this shift of Setting up the Standard, dictated to him by a Desperate necessity, did so far avail him, that if it did not serve to make him known for a Prince of High Mettle, it at least suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic'd from the Military Insolences to secure both his Life and the Imperial Crown: Because that upon the bare sight of this Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, an innumerable Body of arm'd men got together, and thorough all the Burroughs, Wards, Quarters and Serails of <hi>Constantinople</hi> the People flock'd in arms, by which Concourse the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> being animated, he caused Proclamation to be made, that the Soldiers of the Insurrection were Rebells to the Prince and the Laws, and by Consequence Worthy of the Severest Punishments, and that therefore every man of them ought to be sought out with exact Diligence, to make them with their Lives pay th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> penalty of so many slaughters as they had committed in the Princes Ministers and Servants, and to give Life to the Publick Peace by utterly extinguishing those Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macious Enemies of the universal Wellfare. Their Temerity was become Intollerable, and if this Pestilence had not been quite rooted out, it would quickly have infected all the Country with evident Danger of the totall fall of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Monarchy. These Words seem'd a Trumpet that reviv'd in all Peoples minds the Desire of running precipitously to the slaughter of the Mutiniers, Insomuch that in a Trice the People were seen with their Swords in their hands to search the most hidden Recesses and most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed sculking Places, that so they might not leave any seed of so pernicious a Brood. Thus were they cut to pieces in all parts of the City, without any distinction of Degree or Person, having no hopes of any Refuge, seeing the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> had caus'd Proclamation to be made, that all those should be judg'd Guilty of High-Treason, and worthy of Death, that should give Aid, Harbour, or in any wise defend or conceal the foresaid Rebells, so as to impede the Correction due for the Crimes they had
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48635:19"/>
committed; By which means was rooted out in a little time the Plant of this Contumacious Brood, which from a despicable seed had in a trice grown to such a Height, as to shade the whole Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy with its Branches. A Ring-Leader of the Mutineers being surprized by the Loyal Party, he would have redeemed his Life and Liberty by disbursing three hundred Purses; but he offered what was no longer his own, seeing the bare declaration of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell did deprive him of whatever he possess'd, which devolv'd to the <hi>Imperial Fiscal</hi> and Excheequer, and besides these were Moneys pinch'd in sacking the Houses of the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> and <hi>Treasurer,</hi> thus he only restored part of the Booty, and not paid out of his own stock a Redemption for his Life. Therefore was he also stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, and his Carcass thrown with others into the Publick Place, Yet durst they not do the same to the <hi>Mufti,</hi> seeing the Reverence to the Sacerdotal Degree did not permit them to embrue their hands in his Sacred Blood, notwithstanding he had been no small Abettor of the Commotions of the Mutinous Soldiery; but they contented themselves with deposing him from his Office, esteeming it a greater Punishment than Death it self, seeing he must ever live a private Man, with the tormenting &amp; infamous Remembrance of his having been deposed from his Dignity by having fomented the Insurrections of Men against their Lawfull Prince. The <hi>Mufti</hi> his Predecssor was restored to that Post, and in the Place of the slain <hi>Vizier</hi> the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> put the <hi>Nisangi Pacha, pro Interim,</hi> being a man almost decreped, but of great Merit, and this possibly to honour his Death, and to have time to provide another, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of such a Dignity not allowing of its being left vacant. In the mean while, the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> laid mightily to heart the Death of the <hi>Vizier</hi> that was slain by the Mutineers, as well because he owed all his Greatness to his Procurement, as that by his Death he had given signal Instances that he would have prov'd a Valiant General, if the Barbarousness of his Soldiers had not nipt off the flower of their conceived Hopes. Wherefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munerate in part his good service, He caus'd immediately Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation to be made, that whoever had, held, or knew the Place, whither the Goods of the said <hi>Vizier</hi> were removed by the Rebells upon the Plunder of his House, they should within the term of three Days bring them or declare them to the <hi>Imperial</hi> Chamber
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48635:20"/>
upon pain of Death to the Transgressors, commanding that the same thing should be done with the Treasurers Goods. This Proclamation was of great use, for almost all the Goods were restored, and about thirty <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Armenians,</hi> that brought not in the Goods they had bought, were stak'd. The <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi> caus'd all these recover'd Goods of the <hi>Viziers</hi> to be restored to his Sons, having had them again from the <hi>Turks,</hi> who had bought them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Constantinople</hi> seem'd to breath again after the Oppression of so many Tyrants, but was under Apprehensions of being tormented with new Impositions, because that the Rebells in the Sacking of the aforesaid Houses, had Seiz'd on fifty thousand Purses of Reals, which they had divided among themselves, and these being to have supply'd to the War, the Treasury was quite drained. And what likewise augmented the suspicion of new Disturbances was the answer given by the <hi>Pacha</hi> of <hi>Natolya,</hi> of whom the <hi>Divan</hi> having required Succours in the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s name, he freely answer'd, that he knew no other <hi>Sultan</hi> than the deposed one, and that if they did not replace him upon his Throne, he would come with all his forces to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and joyning with the <hi>Christians</hi> make slaughter of all the <hi>Turks</hi>; During these Transactions the <hi>Christians</hi> have been much better treated by the <hi>Turks</hi> than they were ever heretofore, nay the <hi>Divan</hi> has issued out a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that if any <hi>Turk</hi> should upon whatever Occasion molest any <hi>Christian,</hi> the Artizans should be bound under the severest pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties to rise up against the Offender. I suppose the <hi>Turks</hi> do this, hoping by the means of these good Treatments to facilitate with the Confederated Princes the attainment of the so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired Peace; seeing that to this effect they had design'd to send a Minister to those Princes to require it, though upon understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the small Disposition they have thereunto, had made them suspend the Mission. Besides they do this to recompence by some Acknowledgement the good intention of the <hi>Christians</hi> themselves and the Desire they have shewn for the publick Repose, seeing that in their Quarter of <hi>Galata</hi> they had kill'd about eighteen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells, not allowing any Harbour to the Mutiniers in the Places of their Habitation. These are all sufficient Causes whence to deduce the effect of the aforesaid better usage; but some look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48635:20"/>
as the most essential one, the great Zeal and Assistance of the Most Christian King's Ambassador in those parts, who with Singular and ever Memorable Earnestness to second the good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of his Sovereign, omits no manner of means untryed to procure Repose, which has been so often interrupted and deny'd them; and Employs the utmost force of Authority to acquire for them still greater advantages in what concerns the usage of those that live free, but with incomparable Exemplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation trys all forms to get out of the Chains of Slavery those Miserable <hi>Christians,</hi> that live oppressed under its weighty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable Yoke, and accordingly now lately he has dispatcht from those parts into Countrys of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion about six hundred or upwards of Slaves that were the followers of <hi>Christ,</hi> and thus freed out of Servitude. No small augmentation to the Afflictions of <hi>Constantinople</hi> has been occasion'd by a Fire accidentally kindled in that City about the same time, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to Ashes thousands of Houses, and what more especially regards the Publick damage is the Custom-house which was also Subjected to the fire, Abundance of Commodities being thereby consumed, and which belong'd not only to <hi>Turkish,</hi> but also to <hi>Christian</hi> Merchants.</p>
            <p>But what is further worthy of note is the advice brought to the Port, that the Soldiery that was sent back to their Quarters being risen under a Rebellious Leader, do now ravage and infest the Countrys hostilely, seizing on all that offers it self to their hands; having lost all respect for the orders issued out by the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> they resolve no longer to pay any Military Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but freely to scour those Territories and Countreys, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon the means, Product and Incomes of those wretched Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>This is Exactly the present state of Affairs of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Monarchy, whence, whoever shall minutely Examine all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of the fore-related Events will have occasion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Necessary Consequence; that the <hi>Port</hi> this Year is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly reduc'd to an impossibility of making any Resistance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Confederated Arms, as being utterly depriv'd of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers vers'd in Martial Exercises, some being gone to their own Habitations in <hi>Asia,</hi> others in Mutinying and in an Insurrection
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48635:21"/>
in the Country, the <hi>Vizier</hi> made for form sake, being old and unable to undergo the fatigues of Travelling and of War. The Ministers either suspected, or unexpert. The Prince in no wise fix'd in the Throne. The Factions more vigorous than ever. The Deposed <hi>Mahomet</hi> not only fomented by his Adherents in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> but also by those Abroad. His Son esteemed by many, and look'd upon as the Rising Sun, born to disperse the dark Shades of so many unhappy Successes. <hi>Soliman</hi> now reigning, not only deprived of the ability to six &amp; settle his fortune, but likewise Impotent to rule it. The Exchequer Exhausted in such manner that there seems not any possibility of restoring it to a state of contributing to such various Expences as are required, because that the People being burden'd by so many impositions they have undergone to pay the tumultuous Soldiery, and besides compell'd by the Rebells to unjust and Exorbitant Contributions, there seems not the least prospect of their being able to contribute the least assistance to the present Exigencies. In short all Concurrs to better the cause of God; Insomuch that if <hi>Christian</hi> Princes minding the Benefit they may reap from the present Conjunctures, did not spare any means to make notable Acquisitions, they might not only procure the Augmentation of their States, but also the Encrease and Extention of the <hi>Catholique Faith.</hi>
