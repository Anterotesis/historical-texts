            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Here I made a stand; and began cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously to enquire and hunt after all the Anatomists both Ancient and Moderne that had writ of the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> and the motions of the Head, as well to satisfie my self as to crave in ayde of them: and having had a view of as many as I could heare of and conveniently procure, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served their severall veines and Methodicall variations no way an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering my expectation; An emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent thought suggested to my ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination a notable Defect, hitherto undiscerned in that Art which of late hath attained unto a great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which cast me into an exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
<pb facs="tcp:59598:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of admiration at so strange a Preterition, that among the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script Fathers of Anatomy, there hath not been any one who, <hi>Datâ operâ,</hi> had undertaken a generall Survey and Cognomination of the Muscles of the Body, as they are the necessary Instruments of all those motions of the Mind, which are apparently expressed and made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest by the effect of their use and moving in all the parts of the Body, although more Emphatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by those operations they have in the Head and the most remarkable parts thereof. <hi>Galen</hi> in that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Commentary <hi>De motu Muscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum,</hi> wherein he went beyond himselfe, and shewed the greatest miracle of his wit, a Book which all Anatomists kisse with reverence, as conteining the Oracles of Myolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, doth not so much as glance at it, but under the generall notion of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary

and arbitrary motion; and in his Anatomicall Administrations wherein he abundantly prosecutes these motions, and glories to have found out many which were hid and unknown to the Physicians that were before his time, and where he teacheth a Method whereby every single motion may be found out; Nor in his Dissection of Muscles not a word, scarce, pointing to this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, not naming many, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly numerically, not three with an imaginable reference to any Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaticall motion of the Mind. And all the Nomenclators since his time, who have undertaken to play with new names, which for memory, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Speech, and perspicuity of the thing, they have imposed upon the Muscles, have omitted the due regard proper to the Spirit and life of their mentall significations: whereas the Denomination had been

better from the Nature and energe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall property of the Muscle, which should by that Rule have been taken from the more extant and patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call representations of those parts they actuate, and by which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite their Organicall significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. More strange yet, that no Artists should have made this the Subject of their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, but should have all to this Day, either turned their discourse to the structure onely of the Humane Fabrique, the perfections or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry of the Body, or the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and antiquity of the Anatomiqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

'Tis true many have exercized their pens in discourses of the muscles: But an exact Description of the Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing motions of the Muscles none of the Great Professors of Anatomy have so much as thought on; whereas the facility, utility, and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somenesse of such notions might
<pb facs="tcp:59598:8"/>
have invited many; for, what is more easie than to discerne the parts manifest to Sense, and the fidelity of an Ocular assurance? that are so subject to our touch, that in the semblances of those motions wrought in the parts by the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Muscles, we may not only see, but as it were feele and touch the very inward motions of the Mind; if you aske what delight will hence acrew to the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? What is so delightfull as to know by what kind of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings those varying motions and expressions of the Head and Face are performed? What Muscle doth accomplish this or that speaking motion? To observe the scheme or outward figure of each Affection in the Countenance? That is the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of each in its motion, as it is drawn by the Muscles, and to read their significations couched in
<pb facs="tcp:59598:9"/>
their names? So that observing these accidents of the Head and Face, the Types and representations of the Affections which are acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of the Mind, according to the nature of Correlatives, we may find out one by the other. And though it be but Negative ignorance not to be skill'd in such matters, and so may be thought a needlesse Nicety or over-curious Inquisition to know every Muscle of our Head and Face: Yet certainly it cannot but be some disparagement to one that pretends to any ingenuous Education or Reading, to be as a meere Puppet or Mathematicall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not to understand why, or after what manner, the Muscles of his Head move in obedience to the Command of his Will; and so to have no better a Head-piece than that, which counterfeiting the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall motions of Speech, uttered

intend a journey to a certaine place, and many times being engaged in other thoughts, doe passe it: Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is a thing hard enough to believe, that any one should command and not know that he doth command, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore some have dared to affirme, that the beginning of a motion depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the command of the will; but the progresse of a journey to bee done by Custome and Aptitude of parts, since many at that time are turmoyl'd with divers cares: but it is better to affirme the Cause of such errour to be by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the mind detained by some cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. And with <hi>Marinellus</hi> wee may wonder as much, how such motions are many times done in our sleep, which we forget to have done in our sleep, the soule then working obscurely; for when we awake, wee cannot tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee had moved any part of our face or no, and so by oblivion are soone induced to say, they were done without our will or privity, which is the case of your <hi>Noctambuli</hi> (or as <hi>Senner<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If, saith he, the <hi>Head</hi> cannot be moved round, unlesse after the moving of the first Vertebre, which is obvolved about the Tooth of the second, it will be necessary that it should be first moved by this Muscle, and upon its moving, the Head also should be turned: but this cannot be done; Therefore it doth follow, that it is not the Instrument of moving the Head round. For let us look to its rising and insertion [which indeed is the rule to discover the course of a Muscles Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on] if the Vertebre is to be turned round, the <hi>rising</hi> or originall of it will be in the <hi>occipitium,</hi> and the <hi>insertion</hi> in the transverse processe of the said Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebre. Now let this Muscle act, if in the meane season the <hi>Head</hi> may be moved, it cannot act, because there is need of the rest of that very part from whence it ariseth if it must draw: If therefore it be granted that the <hi>Head</hi> may rest, the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59598:44"/>
Muscle working, the Vertebre will be led about, but upon that motion the Head also is wheeled round; therefore it will happen that the <hi>Head</hi> together and at the same time may be <hi>moved</hi> and <hi>rest.</hi> But let us grant the <hi>Head</hi> to be moved when this Muscle acts [<hi>Deniall.</hi>] Now the quaere is, whether it must be moved with a contrary, or the same mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? If it may be moved with a contrary, a concourse without doubt will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nsue, and so the Head will not be moved upon the motion of the Vertebre; because the Vertebre would be agitated to the Right Hand, and the <hi>Head</hi> to the Left, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary motion, whereby they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur and meet together. But let it be the same motion, that both are carried to the Right Hand; I aske again (saith he) which shall have the precedency in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>Head,</hi> or the Vertebre? 'Tis likely it will be answered, the Vertebre should precede, because that is moved <hi>per se,</hi> but the Head by <hi>accident</hi> upon its moving: But the principle or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of moving comes from the <hi>Head,</hi> because the Muscle ariseth from thence, which draws it, therefore it will follow,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59598:45"/>
that the vertebre is moved by the Head; and not the Head by the vertebre, which is against his owne opinion. Yet some may answer, that the <hi>Head is driven</hi> round by this <hi>Muscle,</hi> begining at the vertebre and ending in the Occiput: but if this were granted, it would follow, that this <hi>Muscle</hi> should move the Head <hi>per se,</hi> and not by the motion of the vertebre, and in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Article, which Article according to <hi>Vesalius</hi> is unfit for circular motion.

hath these significations when it is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately so held without any vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and we might call this action of the Muscles, the <hi>Combination,</hi> or <hi>Conspiracy of Pride</hi> and <hi>Arrogance</hi>: or the <hi>Bragga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochios plot.</hi> ¶ But in <hi>fierce audacity,</hi> when we would <hi>affront, defie, upbraid,</hi> and with an <hi>execration</hi> expresse <hi>cruell anger,</hi> we augment the tension of the <hi>Muscles,</hi> and confirme our Head to a Chamelion-like inflexibility, setting withall our face (with the veines retched out) against others. Anatomists call this, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the five figures of the motion of Muscles, according to <hi>Galen, Extreme figure</hi>; where there is an immoderate contention, wherein the parts are vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently stretched out, and wherein the <hi>Muscles</hi> of both kinds work together, and sometimes beyond their strength; but chiefly when we compell a Member to persist longer in that tension, for we cannot long endure the great stresse of the <hi>Nervous fibres.</hi> But this Tonicall fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure may be more or lesse intense ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the pleasure of the mover. This rigid forme of <hi>fierce audacity,</hi> looks like a Crampe or Crick in the Neck,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59598:53"/>
and makes the Muscles to remaine so stretched out, that the Head and Neck seeme indeed immoveable, but yet in truth the Muscles are moved in conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the contracted Muscles, such being the nature of successive motions (as <hi>Laurentius</hi> speaks) that they are no lesse done while they are so kept, than when they were first begun: We may call this generall concurrence of the Muscles, when they are thus perceived to act with perseverance, <hi>Tetanum oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitionis,</hi> the <hi>Rack</hi> of <hi>opposition,</hi> or the <hi>voluntary Crick</hi> of <hi>stiffenecked Cruelty.</hi> But this case of <hi>Tonique motion,</hi> being absolutely the greatest mystery that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to Voluntary motion, deserves a better enquirie. First, This Action is of the same kind with <hi>Contraction,</hi> that is, they agree in the <hi>Genus</hi> of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>but specifically</hi> differ: Yet <hi>Galen</hi> doth not expresse what <hi>Species</hi> of motion it is of. So that this Action is not a change of place, but only an Action with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mobility. <hi>Galen</hi> calls that Action of the Muscle without locall motion, <hi>motum Tonicum,</hi> which perchance with him was all one as to reteine the part in that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59598:53"/>
place from whence it would recede, unlesse it were deteyned by the Action of the Muscle: for, all immobility (as He proves) is not caused by the priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Action: for, a part that is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steyned and held firme in one posture that it stirs not, could not be done, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they did Act; for else it would be altered, or fall by the weight of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Whence it doth follow, that all immobility doth not depend upon the privation of Action, but upon some Action of the Muscle: But the Action of a Muscle is motion, for, the Action of a part is defined by <hi>Galen</hi> an Active motion, but rest is contrary to moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Galen</hi> takes this for a hard and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficult question; yet he hath many kinds of this motion from experience and sence; as that of a bird hanging in the Ayre, and of one swimming against a streame with equall strength, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faculty raising it up equall to the weight of its body depressing, and the strength of the swimmer equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending and striving against the force of the streame. <hi>Serpillon</hi> imagines this to be an action mixed of <hi>tension,</hi> and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59598:54"/>
                     <hi>contraction,</hi> which <hi>Fontanus</hi> his Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist will not endure to heare of. <hi>Galen</hi> in a most smooth and admirable mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty of stile goes over the Rocks and depths of this mystery: It is possible (saith he) to find some <hi>motion,</hi> all the Muscles that are ordered for it ceasing from their Action; and to find a <hi>quies<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi> many Muscles working: For, all motion is not caused by the operation of Muscles, nor all immobility by their rest. Now, whether or no shall we say that they do act and are stretched, but are not moved? And if we feare to say so, we must likewise say that they do not act; for 'tis absurd to confesse they do work according to their innate and most proper Action, and to deny them to be moved; But they appeare not to be moved; yet because the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles act, therefore we say they are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: but because the whole Member whereof they are a part, nor they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves apart, do appeare to move; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for this cause again, we do: not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse they move; where therefore shall a man find a Solution for this doubt.

                     <hi>id est fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo. Fontanus</hi> has a good mind to help <hi>Galen</hi> out in this difficultie, but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours it with little successe: This only he gathers from the Doctrine of <hi>Galen,</hi> that Action without motion of the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, is called a <hi>Tonique motion</hi>; Action with motion, <hi>Contraction</hi>; motion without Action born of the Contracted part, <hi>Extension</hi>; the Decidency of the Muscle, a motion from the weight of the part and Muscle. But seeing of the causes of Tonique motion <hi>Galen</hi> hath written little, <hi>Fontanus</hi> is at a stand, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance thinking it would be an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Design to attempt any thing in that kind after so great a light of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, yet he puts the Quaere, whence this Tonique motion should come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he ventures to conclude, from the motrice faculty commanded, as all other voluntary actions; for, the nearest cause of this motion (as he conceives) is the Animal faculty which moves the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and it is the part of that to susteine the Members whose part it is to move them; wherein, after his great flourish, he hath made no more progresse than
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59598:55"/>
the very words of <hi>Galen</hi> led him to; whom we find concluding, that this <hi>Species</hi> of Action, whether you call it Tonique, or by another name it matters not much, this is true: That in this <hi>Tonique motion,</hi> the Muscles are not idle, but act by the Commandement of the Will. From this Tonique motion <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellus</hi> took his Lepid Paradox (as he was wont to call it,) <hi>In omni motu est quies, &amp; in ipsa quiete motus.</hi> The Muscles most active in this expression of the mind are the two paire of the Extenders of the Neck, the first whereof commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Transversarium,</hi> ariseth from the transverse processes of the six upper Vertebres of the Breast, are fastened on the outside into all the transverse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses of the Vertebres of the Neck. The second paire commonly called <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum,</hi> occupies the whole hinder part of the Neck: This takes many Beginnings out of the roots of the Spines of the seven upper Vertebres of the Breast, and is strongly implanted into the whole lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer part of the Spine of the second Vertebre. These two, when they work together, first extend the Neck, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59598:55"/>
afterward the Head. The first paire might from those workings of the Mind they help to exhibit be called <hi>par arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,</hi> the Arrogant paire or the Muscles of Disdainfull Confidence.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59598:56"/>
shoulder-blade, from its office com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Levator,</hi> or the <hi>Lifter</hi>; the Muscles of this Conjugation even before Dissection being obvious and easie to be perceived in all men, especially in Wrastlers; arising from the first, third, fourth, and fift transverse processe of the Vertebre of the Neck, as 'twere in foure separated beginnings, is inserted into the higher angle of the Scapula, moving the Scapula forward and to the sides of the Neck; and because the shoulder is joyned to the Scapula, by accident it lifts that up also. <hi>Lycas</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Ancients was of opinion, that the Head was drawn down to the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by this Muscle. But <hi>Galen</hi> (who thinks it is better to say this Muscle was formed for the Shoulders sake, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Heads,) saies, this alone was design'd to draw back the whole Shoulders to the Head; Wherefore if we should take away <hi>this</hi> also from the Shoulders, they would be altogether destitute of such a motion: But it has such a motion, as is evident to all men; therefore it is the Muscle that causeth this motion; if there be any other (as
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59598:56"/>
no other there is) this is necessary, and this doth witnesse its operation in the Shoulders, that a Nerve coming unto it from the Braine, if it be Cut, the same motion of the Shoulders and not of the Head is resolved, of which Nerve <hi>Lycas</hi> was ignorant as He objects; and in his Anatomicall Administrations he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a way to discerne the motion of this Muscle, which is a generall rule, <hi>to draw the Muscle to its Head according to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and positure of its fibres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Oribasius</hi> also will have this Muscle to draw the Shoulders to the Head, and takes the course to prove it, in placing its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in the Bone of the <hi>occiput,</hi> and the insertion in the angle of the Scapula. But after what manner soever the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be done, whether by the Heads draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Shoulders, or the Shoulders drawing down the Head, or both; this Muscle <hi>Levator</hi> is most active and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the motion, when it appeares to move the Shoulders upward to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in the shrinking Head, and makes this Dive-dopper, or Dobchick of the Mind most significantly Emphaticall. This motion and signification of the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59598:57"/>
Mind may be thought to be a little furthered by the aid of a portion of that Muscle called by <hi>Galen Trapezius,</hi> from a Geometricall figure; to wit, that por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which contracted, works the Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pula upwards, which is according as it may chance to be moved; for, this action of the Head may not be so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly punctuall, as to the Garbe, in all men, by reason of the personall propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties of men. This Muscle is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known by the name of <hi>Cucullaris</hi>; which <hi>Laurentius</hi> compares to a Maids Coife or Kercher, <hi>Columbus</hi> likens it to a Clout the Women of <hi>Cremona</hi> weare up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their shoulders; and <hi>Vesalius</hi> thinks that <hi>Franciscans,</hi> and the rest of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Monks borrowed the shape of their Hoods from this Muscle; which being fashioned round like a Hood, that is a little Cell for the Head, it seemes to have a signature of <hi>absconsion,</hi> which it seemes to offer the Head, which seemes then ashamed to shew it selfe, by helping the Shoulders to rise, which then are most properly <hi>Scapul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And indeed such impressions has a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly apprehension of such matters made sometimes in the Head of a Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocondriacall <hi>Nichodemus,</hi> that they have caused him to shrowd his Head in a Hood, and turne Monke and a Recluse from the conversation of men. Another Muscle that assists in this Action, is that which is commonly called <hi>Serratus mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> from the fashion of a Saw which it resembles, for, this with its upper <hi>Fibres</hi> alone, when they are contracted, may seeme to cooperate to the signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of this gesture; and the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature of that Muscle seemes, either to insinuate the doubtfull conflict of those thoughts which draw a man in this case by a various <hi>vicissitude,</hi> now into one frame of excuse, and then into another,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59598:58"/>
before they can resolve what is best for their turne (so that their thoughts seem, as <hi>Festus</hi> saith, <hi>Serra pugnare,</hi> that is, successively to move forward and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede; and indeed this outward gesture if it chance to be repeated, doth not very much differ from the posture of those who work in a pit with a two-handed Saw:) Or else as <hi>Placiades</hi> observed, this signature of a Saw may signify Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, or as he calls it evill speaking, by reason of the row of Teeth which seeme to intimate some Mordacity, of which the Party labouring being very sensible by reason of that hated stridor that is so offensive to the Eares of those who are hit in the teeth with things w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> it is too late to remedy; that it may be the Mind thereby now put into a sowre horror, such as a Saw causeth in the Body when it falleth into knots, bethinks it selfe what instrument it hath in readinesse in the Body (which indeed hath the Signatures of all things,) to fit its pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in such an intricate nick of irreso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; and not being able soone enough to resolve the Doubt she is in, the Mind seemes by using this two-handed-saw

                     <hi>Muscle</hi> at last resolved, that there is no way but to saw the knot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder, and to breake through with Head and Shoulders.

For there is a neere relation betweene the <hi>Muscles</hi> of the <hi>Scapula,</hi> the Shoulder, and the Arme or Cubit; and their motions are Cozen-germans, for as the <hi>Scapula</hi> is moved <hi>per se,</hi> and the arme together by accident, and the <hi>Scapula</hi> by accident of the Brachiall <hi>Muscles,</hi> which while they draw the Arme by a certaine kind of Consequution they lead the <hi>Scapula</hi> which is annexed unto it together with

Thus have we now upon the best hints we could meet with raised, with much liberty of conceit, unexpected Allegories from the instruments of this Action. But the Name which refers to the significations of the Mind exhibited by that Action, must be given to the Muscle most predominant and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratively acting therein; which is the

Muscle commonly call'd the Levator of the Scapula. This Action being one of the first I set upon to unridle, being thought by some that nothing of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely or probability could be said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and objected to mee as an Action not possibly to be made tractable to the scope of my Designe; At my first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into this Enquiry I found this Muscle in Dr. <hi>Rheades</hi> Anatomy of the Muscles styled the Muscle of patience, which I confesse at first sight I tooke but to intimate the Corporall virtue of a Porter, and not much better than that Patience which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call <hi>Asini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num onus</hi>; and seeing it expos'd naked without any glosse of interpretation out of his owne conceite nor any other authority, it passed with me for a Dull notion and little to my purpose; when considering the Action wherein this Muscle sirnam'd the Lifter was usually seen in those that like not a thing that has happend, for which there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy but Patience, I saw it might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly stand with the intention of the mind, if it were named <hi>Musculus Patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae</hi> the Muscle of <hi>Sufferance,</hi> or <hi>Patience

Erronious there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is their Conceit to whom it seemes that Laughter is a certaine common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the parts towards the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Soule, wherein that conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed joy doth flourish: for they will have them to be contracted and coadunited in that part, wherefore the Muscles of the Face, Throat &amp; the midriffe is drawn back to the heart. which is absur'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the same Species almost of motion is effected in griefe, which verily ought not to be done, for griefe rather repells, and withall we see that the <hi>impe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that the motion of laughter begun within in the middle <hi>venter,</hi> the <hi>terminus ad quem</hi> is the extreme part of the Face, where it terminates, because that part is the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59598:66"/>
                     <hi>emunctuary</hi> of the senses, by which our mind doth both receive in and utter the affections, since by that part it doth perceive, and in that part the Sensories are instructed; wherefore to it the whole sense, and more over our whole mind doth conspire. Hence therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes the Equable Emission and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Sense in the Face, as it were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and coming forth. Hence the Aire is breath'd out thick and short. Hence the Midriffe is contracted and the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the face, because the equable Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion with the alacrity of Sense reaching up to the Sence of the Face, cannot be done without the retraction of those Muscles. In this Dance of the Muscles performed by excessive Laughter upon the Theater of mirth, the Countenance, the Mouth seemes to lead the Chorus; For, Laughter is a motion arising chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the Contraction of the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the <hi>Lips,</hi> in which motion of the <hi>Mouth,</hi> called Laughter, the parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Mouth</hi> seem bounded out with certaine lines called <hi>Rictus,</hi> whence <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</hi> And this contraction of the Muscles of the <hi>Lips,</hi> is occasion'd by reason of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59598:66"/>
the consent they have with the Nerves of the Braine drawn back to their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; and with the <hi>Diphragma,</hi> the grand Muscle of this and all other passions which is altogether almost <hi>nervous</hi> and <hi>musculous.</hi> And because the <hi>Lips</hi> are Muscles of themselves in respect of their instrumentall relation to speech, their engagement in this passion renders them unserviceable for the framing of words; for, the formes &amp; matter of words both are then intercepted; the first by the streighning of the <hi>Gorge</hi> &amp; <hi>Lips,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> will not admit of any articulation especially labiall: &amp; the latter by the Interjections breaking off the voyce at the Larinx. Hence it is we heare men say they could not speake for laughing; nor indeede can we eate in the violence of this passion, the impediment proceeding from this Diduction of the <hi>Lips</hi> which were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us to eate and drinke withall; yet the <hi>Mouth</hi> is more shut than open, that is it is Dehiscent, yet scarce Dehiscent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Casme, yet the <hi>Lips</hi> are so distend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and contracted that they discover the <hi>Teeth.</hi> The <hi>Lower-Iaw</hi> after a manner inclines inward.

But this <hi>genuine</hi> figure of true laughter is somewhat various, according to the various Constitution of the substance of particular persons, in the parts of their face; that as to the individualls, it is almost unutterable, for you shall see in some, in the Chin and in the Cheekes certaine concavities then caused like those in the Hands and other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; in some a pleasant p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

contracted, nor swell, for in laughter the Face swells: for, the whole Countenance is powred out and spread with the Spirits that then swell the Muscles, there being a great concourse of Spirits and bloud unto the Face, which bear a reat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now this <hi>figure</hi> that compriseth the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations of every part in the <hi>face</hi> follows
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59598:68"/>
as an effect and consequence of the mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Muscles that are proper to the parts, or which being Common have by their conformation a Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall dependency one upon another. But this is not all: for, that which is most remarkable and worthy observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, that this moving of the parts of the <hi>Face</hi> although very great, is done &amp; undone on a sudden, and almost in a moment; that is, a mans Face forthwith falls into the posture of laughing, and while in that posture he laughes, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently leaves off the motion; which as it suddenly comes, so it goes; when a man ceaseth from laughter although it be at the highest pitch and scrued up to the very Eela of mirth, it vanisheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and needes no time of interpositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to abate by degrees, to take out the tracts of the operations of so many and divers engaged Muscles, which inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently cease from their labour, for as soone as the Conceite and jest is at an end, the laughter being naturall, the mouth and parts of the face returne to their former situation, the motion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now over; of which sudden begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59598:69"/>
and ending of so many concurring motions the Cause may be supposed, the subtiltie of the Spirits in their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when they ascend to the face: But what kind of moving of the Muscles this should be is somewhat difficult to conjecture, although it is so manifest and evident in appearance. 'Tis true, we can conjecture a Muscle to move or to be moved, for we know a Muscle hath moved its appointed moveable, when contracted, it appeares shorter and harder; especially if it have a bon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> under it, as all the Muscles of the <hi>Face</hi> have. But here all the parts of the <hi>Face,</hi> except that perchance of the Forehead, seeme to be contracted together; and the whole face, according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of its substance, to grow stiff and hard; wherefore it seemes most probable, that all the Muscles of the face are moved together at once, yet the controversie is somewhat intricate, &amp; they that are for the Negative allege, that the same thing cannot be moved by contrary motions at the same time, as for example; Some Muscles move the <hi>Lower-Iaw downwards,</hi> and so open
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59598:69"/>
the mouth; others by moving the <hi>Iaw upwards</hi> close it; others move it out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, others inward; others draw it to one side and drive it round; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all of them seeme not to Move at once. To which is answer'd, that things moving in <hi>Contraria,</hi> in the same move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, if they be of equall virtue, they either doe nothing, or if they doe, the moveable is distracted: but if they be of unequall power and strength, the weaker gives way to the motion of the stronger; yet the prevailing Mover in the conflict or contention obtaines not the same vigour, or as much as if it had not contended at all and had moved without opposition; for if all Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Agents (as the learned know) in Doing Suffer also, and after some man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner abate of the Degree of their virtue; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ow much more will it happen when one hath an adversary, although weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, yet openly, endeavouring against him? Wherfore it may be suppos'd it doth not move so perfectly as it would, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>f it were not hinder'd by its Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The way to discover the manner of moving in this Conglobation of Muscles
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59598:70"/>
in laughter is, to consider what Muscles of parts of the Face are <hi>effectivè</hi> more or fewer, thicker or smaller; for, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moving together are not stronger than fewer if they be all equally quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and the great and thick are stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than the small and slender, as may be made manifest by speciall example.</p>
                  <p>As first, the Muscles that move the <hi>lower-Jaw</hi> drawing it upwards to close the Mouth, are more and thick, and therefore stronger than those that lead it downwards to open the Mouth; as is well known out of the Anatomy of those Muscles. Now, because in Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Mouth is neither too much closed, nor yet gapes; the Muscles that serve to <hi>shut</hi> and <hi>open</hi> the <hi>Mouth</hi> are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved together; the <hi>Mouth</hi> not being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly shut, although the Muscles are more intense which are appointed to shut it; but withall is somewhat open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by reason of the repugnancy of the opening Muscles. Hence it is that in over Laughter our <hi>Iawes</hi> ake, so that they seeme to suffer a luxation, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the contrariety of moving and violent Conflict; for, the Ligaments,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59598:70"/>
Nerves and Fibres are after a manner di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted and drawn into factions. And we may observe that the <hi>Masticatory Muscles,</hi> (which are better called Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall from their use) whose fibres by reason of their Divers Heads, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting one another after a divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner are inserted acrosse in manner of the Letter X, do manifest their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this motion, for by reason of their Fibres, although they move to the Right hand and to the Left, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they can withall not a little move the <hi>lower-Iaw</hi> either outward and inward. The Muscle called <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducens P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59598:71"/>
in, because the Muscles are more valid which move the <hi>Iawes</hi> inward; which perchance may not so exactly appeare alike in all men, but may differ accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the divers Condition, Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Commension of their parts. The Contraction of the Temporall Muscle which is but small in Men, is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle observed; nor that of the <hi>double-belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Depriment</hi> which works contrary to the other, for they are small and thin, their employment being easie, because the <hi>Iaw</hi> with its own weight tends downward and hath no need of any strong Retractor, but as a heavy thing, it is drawn down with a little adoe, to open the Mouth.</p>
                  <p>In the motions of the <hi>Lips</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety is not very much perspicuous, for they are exercised in two moveable Lips; wherefore their Muscles contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, they are Contracted, to wit, the <hi>upper Lip</hi> upward, the <hi>lower Lip</hi> downwards; whereupon the Teeth are discovered; whence some derive <hi>Rideo a Radio.</hi> But that we see the <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Lip</hi> more contracted than the <hi>lower,</hi> it hath that property from the more
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59598:71"/>
valid Muscles which it hath obteined; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or although the Muscles of the <hi>lower Lip</hi> are broader than those of the <hi>upper,</hi> yet being shorter they gaine no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by their Breadth; for, the Length of a Cord gives more advantage in Drawing than the Breadth. And that the <hi>Lips</hi> also in Laughter are moved nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inward nor outward, (which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and those indeed contrary every one of them hath, happening by the advantage of certaine fibres belonging to their Muscles) the cause is, that they being weaker than the Muscles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, moving the <hi>upper Lip</hi> upwards, and the <hi>lower</hi> downwards, by good right give way to their motions, neither are they able according to their usuall operation to move the <hi>Lips</hi> inward or outward, especially since they are strongly drawn in on both sides, and extended by the Contraction of the Cheekes, to which on both Hands they are annexed.</p>
                  <p>The Muscles which <hi>draw out and open the Nostrils,</hi> excell so in strength the <hi>constringent pai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59598:72"/>
in the Nose is not so percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible to sense; therefore in Laughter they are strongly Contracted, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Nostrills are opened, and especially in Derision are wrinkled; and these Muscles so raise up and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the <hi>Nostrils,</hi> that the Nose seemes crooked and hooked, and by that means also the <hi>Nostrils</hi> become acute.</p>
                  <p>We may observe concerning the <hi>Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids</hi> which are two over each Eye, an <hi>upper,</hi> and a <hi>lower Lid,</hi> that the <hi>upper Lid</hi> only, according to <hi>Galen,</hi> is moved upward and downward by the office of divers Muscles having contrary moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; So that by this Rule and M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59598:72"/>
although <hi>Aristotle</hi> who was not advised of Muscles (much lesse of the Muscle which late Anatomists have found for that motion) truely affirmes the <hi>lower-lid</hi> to be also moved in man: yet that motion is but small and little better then nothing; and that which is as it were nothing, is to be thought in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to be absent. Whatsoever is to bee observ'd of this matter from late <hi>Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,</hi> this is enough for this purpose, that the <hi>upper-Eylid</hi> hath obteined two contrary motions, and therefore can neither shut nor open the Eye overmuch in laughter, although it shuts it more; and it is observable that by reason of this contrariety of moving of the <hi>upper-Eyelid,</hi> that in laughter there is made, by reason of the Contranixion, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine corrugation or wrinkle about the angle of the Eye, especially the outward angle, which in those that laugh often, are supposed to grow habituall: which some Ladyes fearing, will not laugh, lest they should contract wrinkles and looke old by breaking in that part which is neere the Temples, whose <hi>Latine E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the Throate. For since the Midriff is therefore contracted taking this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the dilatation of the Heart, and to beare up against the moving of the Sense and Spirit, lest it should to the great endangering of life be emptied and vanish away: or because it behov'd these parts so to endeavour for the strength of the motion to bee made which is at hand.

Midriffe without the manifest act of Gurgulation, we should therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve either that Laughter of it self is such a motion, or that this, at least for the greatest part, is its Nature, since all these may be counterfeited, and may be rather an Image of Laughter; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there must somewhat precede in the Soule, and the first Sensitive, that Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be absolute and accomplished in all its numbers.

And first the Braine commands the Nerves, these stir up the Muscles, and they agitate the parts annexed unto them; untill the whole Body, as it were to gratifie the Mind as a King, signifies its conceived Joy in all the waies and officious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of triumphant gesture it possibly can; and as every part is nigher to its Principle, so much the sooner and vehemently it is moved. And although, to speak according to the modesty of <hi>Caesars</hi> Speech in <hi>Tully,</hi> we are ignorant how Laughter exists, where it is, and from what place it so suddenly breaks out into the Countenance: yet the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and order of the generation of Laughter may be supposed to be after this manner. When some pleasant queint novel and conceited object offers it self to the Senses, there is an impression thereof made in the Braine, the Object thus come into the Braine, the Mind is filled with <hi>Ioy,</hi> this by the first branch of those Nerves of the sixt Conjugati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which goeth into the Heart is carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Concerning

the chiefe <hi>corporall Principle,</hi> and <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Instrument</hi> wherewith <hi>Laughter</hi> is performed, the Learned differ in their Judgments. <hi>Democritus</hi> thought that that first part and <hi>chiefe Principle</hi> was the <hi>Spleene,</hi> and that the other parts were but as Instruments a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Which opinion to others hath justly seemed absurd, because Laughter is performed by the ministeriall assistance of certaine motion, but the Spleene is beheld neither to be moved, nor to be the Principle of any kind of moving, yet we see those parts to be moved which are in the Breast and middle venter; besides, it is not accounted the prime seat of any faculty of the Soule, much lesse of the Cognoscent or Animal; therefore it cannot be the prime Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Laughter. Others have belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the prime Part by which Laughter is begotten, to be the Diaphragma, for that is a certaine Muscle somewhat broad, placed neere the Mind, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in alacrity of Sense, agile to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of it self, in the first place sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to Respiration, being of such

                     </gap>, <hi>quasi mentem vel mentis sedem,</hi> and they thought that Phrensies and Delirations arose from thence: Therefore it is no marvell if Laughter also should be first wrought by this part, since it is swift and expedite to swift motions, being a broad Muscle and most plentifully abounding with Sense and Spirit, which is equally dilated through it: (for, Laughter is accounted to be as a certaine Dilation,) and is withall the prime In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of <hi>Spiration,</hi> which appeares to be in a manner the <hi>substance</hi> of <hi>Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which <hi>Aristotle</hi> affirmes, where he saith, that for this cause the tickling one under the Armes causeth this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, because the Midriffe is fastened in that part, whereby it easily opens and moves the Sense of this Muscle besides our Will; which (indeed) is somewhat apparent to Sense; for, in any the least Laughter the Midriffe is manifestly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved and retracted, and the beginning of motion being made there, the other parts, as the Lungs, and Muscles of the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59598:81"/>
Face are forthwith stirred and moved. But because the Midriffe is in no manner a principall part of the body, nor the chiefe seat of the Soule, or of any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; therefore neither doth it seeme Consentaneous it should be accounted the prime Principle of Laughing; wherefore for some reasons the Body of the Heart hath been by some adjudged the prime seat and original of Laughter. But Physicians who upon the best ground make the Braine to be <hi>primum Sensitivum,</hi> affirme the Braine to be the <hi>Prime Principle</hi> of <hi>Laughing</hi>; but this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to be made common by consent to the Diaphragma, and that it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the <hi>prime Instrument,</hi> because it begins to be formed, and to appeare by this part, the other parts thereupon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring to the operation, wherein it is necessary to use a Distinction for the better clearing of the Point, for it is one thing to be the <hi>prime</hi> and <hi>neerest Principle,</hi> and another thing to be the <hi>

Since it was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the same end, and hath a place no lesse accommodated for the receiving of Muscles. Nature seemes here, as he confesseth, unjust; when she might
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59598:89"/>
have divided it equally between them, yet she would gratifie the upper with the whole priviledge of motion: and not only unjust in that, but in making the lower Eye-lid lesse than the upper, which as other parts should have been equall, yet for that, he applauds the artifice: but his inference from thence, which he saies is perspicuous, that it needed no motion, there he failes; the Reason of his Doubt he there shews upon an experiment of observation: and it seemes to him to need animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, and if he had hit on the right, he promiseth to declare his mind in that Book of Doubtfull motions he intended to write. Here, saith he, it is sufficient to say that the subtlety of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is such, that many Great men ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sought to find it out, yet have not attained unto the full knowledge of it. <hi>Vesalius</hi> in this follows <hi>Galen. Archan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelus</hi> saies the <hi>lower Eye-lids</hi> stand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable, or immovable of themselves, unlesse they are stirred up by the motion of the <hi>Genae. Weker</hi> sayes they seeme to partake of no motion, there being no Muscle allowed unto them to endue
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59598:89"/>
them with any instinct of action. <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius</hi> conceives all the motion, and so consequently the signification, to be performed by the <hi>upper Eye-lid.</hi> Some say that it is after a manner moveable. Indeed the motion of the <hi>lower Lid,</hi> it being lesse, is very small and obscure; yet not so saith <hi>Riolanus,</hi> but every man may deprehend it in himself: the other being greater, hath a more evident mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Bauhinus</hi> saies both the Eye-lids move, as is evident to sense. <hi>Parae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> saies there is no difference between the lower and the upper Eye-lid, than that the upper brings forth a more open and manifest motion: the lower a more obscurer, otherwise Nature had in vain compassed it about with the substance of a Muscle, which late Anatomists have found out. And indeed the Cause of their motion is very admirable; for, it altogether imported them to be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a voluntary motion, else there were no use for them. But to all volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary motions Nature hath provided certaine Instruments, which we call Muscles, which move the particles into which they are inserted; for, since we
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59598:90"/>
can move them quicker or slower, oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or seldomer, or altogether refraine their motion, and againe excite them to motion, is not he deceived who saies their actions are naturall and besides our Will? And in vaine were they gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us unlesse we could use them at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and to some signification of the Mind. The Muscles that are designed for the significant motions of the Eye-lids are three, one right, and two semi-circular.</p>

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59598:90"/>
skin, and the Muscles of the Lips; when you come, saith He, to the <hi>Eyes,</hi> you shall teach how by this one Muscle, the Eye is both opened and shut; because it is compounded of a threefold kind of fibres. Although by the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all men that have hitherto written of Anatomie, these actions are said to be done by the force of two Muscles appointed for that purpose, and although in their publique Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations these two Muscles are wont to be solemnly shewn, yet I think, saith He, the very Demonstrators are no more assured of them than my selfe. And the ground upon which he tooke this opinion up is, because to those that separate the fleshy Pannicle or broad Muscle, no other Musculous flesh ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in those places, than what is of that Pannicle, whether you guide your Knife from the front downward, or from the Ball of the Cheeke upward: besides, in incisions in the Eye-brows upon urgent occasion, we are prohibited to work them transverse, lest this broad Muscle falling upon the Eye, should make the upper Eye-lid or upper cilium
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59598:91"/>
immoveable: and if any such incision happen by chance, we are bid presently to sew it up; which thing is a very strong argument that the motion of the upper Cilium or the Superior Eye-lid is not performed by its own proper Muscles, but wholy depends upon the broad Muscle for performance. But his next Argument is somewhat Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall to the Doctrine of voluntary motion. Now (saith he) if there should be such proper Muscles in the upper Eye-lid as are described, because when one Muscle acts, his opposite or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonist doth cease, and ought to give way and be obsequious: that which is said to open the Eye working, his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite obsequiously yielding, it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily follows the Muscle of the upper Eye-lid will be drawn towards it Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple or beginning, as we see to happen in Convulsions; because the operation of a Muscle is a Collection of that part which it moves, towards its Head; since therefore such a kind of Collection no where appeares, therfore he thinks it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that all the motion of the upper <hi>Eye-lid</hi> depends upon this broad Muscle,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59598:91"/>
and that it is the sole Author of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and consequently of these signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the Mind exhibited thereby. Nor is it to be omitted what <hi>Galen</hi> affirmes, that the skin was endued with a voluntary motion even for this very action, for it was necessary the Eye-lids should be much opened when we endeavor to see many Externall things at one time, which is their intention who in this posture <hi>simply admire,</hi> or <hi>impudently Gaze</hi>; for which (a little) the circumfused skin, as well that above in the Forehead, as that beneath at the Ball of the Cheeke, hath a voluntary motion, that by extension thereof it might open wide the Eyes. <hi>Vesalius</hi> speakes of a broad and fleshy Glandule, which seemes to him to be a certaine vice-Muscle to lift up the Eye-lid. But we will conclude with the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall opinion of the best Anatomists, that these motions of the Mind are signified by the operation of that Muscle of the <hi>Eye-lid,</hi> which is commonly called <hi>Rectus,</hi> or the straight Muscle, and from this office <hi>Apertor oculi,</hi> and <hi>Artollens palpebram,</hi> the <hi>Eye-opener,</hi> or the <hi>Gazer,</hi>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:59598:92"/>
placed in the upper region of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the Eye, neare the <hi>Musculus Artollens</hi> or Lifter of the Eye, being like also in figure to it, proceeding from the same Principle as the rest which move the Eye, and inserted into the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilage of the upper Eye-lid, and by its fibres contracted inwards, draws the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Eye-lid upwards, the lower of its own accord subsiding into its place, assisted, according to the intensnes of the Act, in these significations, by the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Forehead. So that this Muscle commonly called <hi>Attollens palbebram,</hi> might be named from the declaration of these affections of the Mind effected by their moving, <hi>Musculus Impudicus, vel simplicis Admirationis,</hi> the Muscle of <hi>staring Impudence,</hi> or <hi>simple Admiration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>¶ Another expression of the Mind is sometime performed by this Muscle, to wit, <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>Loftinesse</hi>; for <hi>Solomon</hi> in a Physiognomicall Proverb, observed a Generation of men, whose Eye-lids were lifted up; and therefore whereas the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollent Muscle of the Eye is called by Physiognomers <hi>Musculus superbus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a sign of Pride to have lofty
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59598:92"/>
Eyes: <hi>Casserius</hi> the expert Anatomist, would rather have the declarations of <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>humility</hi> to be drawn from the <hi>Eye-lids,</hi> and especially from the upper Eye-lid, for who have this elate, are proud and fierce; they who have it depressed, and shutting as it were halfe of the Eye, so that they seeme to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the ground, are <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>mild.</hi> So that it might be called <hi>Musculus Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limis</hi> the <hi>Sublime</hi> or <hi>haughty Muscle</hi> of the Eye-lids.</p>

These two Muscles when contracted into themselves, the greater drawes downe the upper Eye-lid, and the lesser attracts and raiseth up the lower Eye-lid, so that the lower Eye-lid is onely lifted up, and that with the second Shutter. <hi>Baubinus</hi> who would have these two to be but one Muscle by reason of their fibres which are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed sayes, that this Drawn towards its begining, at one time moves the upper Eye-lid downwards and the lower up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and so conjoynes and shuts both the lids together; which the continui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in circuite and angle, and the mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the same angle, especially more constrict which is perceived by sight and touch doe prove: for, nothing can be constringed and come to a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all contact, unlesse some parts be led

the whole eye, this tendo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous membrane is inserted into the hornie Coate in that part where it is pellucid before the Iris or Rainbow of the Eye, Whence it comes to passe that al the Muscles working together the Eye is staid and established. But <hi>Columbus</hi> who challengeth the fift Muscle as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered first by his invention, affirmes that Muscle to come into the aid of the other foure, which stayes the Eye, as its situation shewes, when it is contracted towards its Head, holding the Eye that it fall not out of its Seate. And <hi>Lauren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> will have all the six Muscles of the Eye to concurre and to stretch their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres to this Ballancing or equall fixing of the Eye. This makes <hi>Lavellus, Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi> and others contradict <hi>Galen, Vesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, Fuchius</hi> and others that follow him, as if there were no need of a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Muscle. But although <hi>Spigelius</hi> and others will allow no Muscle to be purposely assign'd to this <hi>Tonique</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Eye: yet <hi>Avicen, Fernelius</hi> and some late expert Anatomists are for the seaventh Muscle, affirming that the Muscle which is most active and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59598:102"/>
design'd to this action is, that <hi>bulbous</hi> and <hi>orbicular</hi> Muscle which they leave to Beasts, who have need of such a Muscle by reason of their prone aspect, whereas mans <hi>os sublime</hi> makes it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary. As for them who cannot see this Muscle (if there were any doubt of it) the expression of <hi>Fontanus</hi> which he useth about <hi>Folius</hi> his affirming to have sometimes seene the <hi>venae lacteae,</hi> may be applyed. It is easier to believe one that writes affirming he hath seen it, than him who denies he hath seene it: for, because one hath not seen a thing, it doth not straightwise follow that that thing is not, but that which one truely sees, that is, because sense is of things existent. This Muscle therefore that encompasseth the Optique Nerve and the Basis of the Eye, hath a signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Situation for this purpose, and therefore being the Chiefe operator it might be called the <hi>Tonique Muscule.</hi> And because <hi>Admiration, Cogitation</hi> and <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive Deliberation</hi> are a kind of suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or fixing of the mind, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent application (for, the whole force of the mind is fixed upon the thing and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59598:103"/>
therefore it is called an intention) And because Extasie is a certaine excesse of the mind and phantsie in <hi>Admiration,</hi> from whence the Nerves are stretched and the Eyes made immoveable in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of the posture of the mind, this Muscle might be called <hi>Musculus intentae Cogitationis, voluntariae E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is of things formidable and is an affection above an Extasie, which has then no name but is called Horror from its effect; for, the Spirits that move the Muscles being made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, the Eyes become stiff as horne; for, <hi>admiration</hi> causeth a tension, <hi>feare frigiditie,</hi> whence the Nerves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come distended and as it were congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.

                     <hi>Tonique,</hi> and is besides nature, when the Eyes remaine fixed whether we will or no: which happens (as they usually say) when the faculty that moves the Muscles is resolved, weaken'd or wholy extinguished; or because those Muscles are all equally gather'd and contracted into their Heads.</p>

                     </hi> two men who had this moving. And when I was a boy I remember a School-fellow of mine in whom I was wont to observe that by way of sport he would often wagg his Eares. So that the Eares
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59598:104"/>
although in man for the most part they are immoveable, so that their motion is sensibly perceived in very few; yet if it happen that we move them at our pleasure as has bin observ'd in many, that is performed by Muscles; <hi>Caelius</hi> imagines that these Muscles which are perceived to be so wonderfully moved in some men, is not by reason of the inward motion of the Eare, but by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusion or excussion of the Muscle that moves the Jaw, which sometimes is drawne so neere the Eare that it touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it. But indeede the Muscles whose action is motion and the Nerves which are commonly observed about the Eares doe declare it to be true that the motive virtue doth flow into the Eares. And <hi>Vesalius</hi> the great Anatomist affirmes that they are moved by reason of their Muscles. Indeede as <hi>Casserius</hi> wel argues, Although the energeticall force of moving be only deprehended by the senses as apparent now &amp; then in a few certaine men, yet the influence of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is generall into the Eares of al men, which makes them partakers of volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry motion; for, unlesse it were so, wee
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59598:105"/>
must protest against the Doctrine of all Anatomists now from many ages con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by most certaine, infallible and frequent observations; That motion is not the essentiall action of a Muscle, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is no auricle but hath its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Muscles: Neither doth the Sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all immobility of all auricles almost perswade this very thing; for, it is an <hi>Elenchus Consequentiae,</hi> The motion of the auricles appeares not to sence, <hi>Ergo</hi> they have none: For, although we are to yield to reasons, when the effect ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to the senses; yet where the sense proves defective and reasons may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, the effect is not to bee denied; for, if as <hi>Galen</hi> witnesseth, there concurre to an Agent a fit situation, a due space of time, a valid force of the Agent and a disposition of matter to receive, what should hinder the effect? these for the most part to be present in the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing the motion of the Eares, even Sense doth teach; wherefore although the motions of the Eares are not made manifest, yet it is not to be denyed, but some motion at least and lesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous to sense is performed by them.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59598:105"/>
The cause why men doe not ordinarily and evidently move the exterior Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages of their Eares as other Animalls doe which have them is, as <hi>Baubinus</hi> and others conjecture, because those princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palls of motion are very small, So that <hi>Galen</hi> ealls them certaine Delineaments of Muscles, and they have little threads of Nerves, So that the motive Spirits cannot in sufficient quantity flow into them: and the Eares are too little and Cartilagineous, whereby the little Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Muscles and Nerves cannot be expanded; whence their motions are so rare, and so little perspicuous and obvious to sense, which are greater in such men whose Eares are perspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously moved. And where the occipitiall Muscles are found, these of the Eares are manifestly discover'd.

                     </gap> Discipline should be depraved, especially since the eares of man are small where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are moved every way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive sounds by the most swift motion of the Head, and therefore in Brutes who want that expeditious mobility of the Head, they are greater, to be more capable of sounds from all parts, and to drive away flyes, which man can doe with his hands. So that to prevent a greater inconveniency and undecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy than their ordinary employment could recompence, they are usually sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended from preceptible actions in most men, yet, this is not without a <hi>Tacite elogie</hi> of the Pleropheria of motion which the face enjoyes by its Muscles, to which the surplusage of auricular motion might seeme unnecessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundant; for, the Face of man is so suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently provided of Muscles, the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of voluntary motion, which are ever ready to expresse any motion his will is pleased to concurre unto, and make a significant declaration by, that

Now although to men that can expresse their affections not onely in wordes, but also by speaking motions, especially in their Faces which are open and discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Nature hath seem'd to have thought it undecent and unprofitable, to have any great volubility or flexibility (for so we must speake for want of better wordes) in the motion of their Eares as other Animalls, the flexibility of his Head and Neck serving the Eares to all such intents and purposes; yet since these Auricular Muscles (the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention whereof are due to <hi>Fallopius</hi>) were appositely conspicuous in them by whom they were manifestly moved while they lived, and are not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by him, but most Anatomists, we will first describe them, and then see

These move the Wings of the Nose with a voluntary motion, the other part of the Nose remaining immoveable; and being throughout connexed with the <hi>skin</hi> that lies over them, it administers unto the Motion and Corrugation thereof.

who saith, when the Constringent cease from their action, the Nostrills are forcibly driven out with a Cholerique wind. These Constringent Muscles are very small as they can scarce be seene or distinguished, unlesse in those that have great Noses; and they are two paire, whereof the first paire is exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, arising from about the roote of the wings, and is inserted into the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Globe of the Nose; the second is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, and hidden in the cavity of the Nostrills, arising from the bones of the Nose where they end neere the Cartilages, and is inserted into the wings of the Nose: That contracted, depresseth the wings; this doth intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce or bring them in, and so shuts the Nostrills. And it may be the orbicular Muscle of the upper Lip, drawing that Lip downward, doth withall constringe and shut the Nostrills, helping a little the attractive action of the Nose.

those voluntary motions which appeare in them, which are as <hi>Galen</hi> observes performed without the motion of the lower Jaw or opening of the Mouth, the Cheeke and the skin to which they are annexed being onely moved, which motion is evident before Dissection; the Region of their power being that infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior looser part seated without the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Jawes and is extended from the Chin almost unto the Eyes, and which by the breath recalled by the Lungs and reteined in the Lips shut, may bee blowne up. As for the Balls or Aples of the Cheekes, the seate of Shame, they have no Muscles, but are drawn in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort by the motion of the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing skin, not having any proper sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications appertainng to voluntary or locall motion; but although they have no Muscles disposed under them, yet is the skin loose having under it the membrane <hi>Periostium,</hi> and because its interior part adheres to the Cheekes, and the Superior part is united with the Musculous substance which is under the Forehead, it may be moved together with them. <hi>Galen</hi> allowes us, if we will,

to reckon this a fift Species of skin; but according to its proper Species, it differs nothing from the skin of the whole Body: yet because it hath this peculiar, to be conteined and hemmed in by two skins, and those movable, united and cohering with them, by that reason comes to be endued with a voluntary motion; and, therein, now differs from the skin of the whole Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall.

Muscles are so drawne together, there is a necessity the Muscle of the other Cheeke should be drawn to follow the Retraction, which thereupon becomes more extended and longer than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for those that are <hi>Musculi conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neres,</hi> that is, which conspire to one and the selfe-same actuall expression, which are usually one on the Right side and another on the Left, as often as these Muscles in the opposite parts are paires in number, magnitude, and strength, the contraction of one makes a relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the other, that part which is contracted drawing the other, to wit the whole Cheeke aside unto it, so that it alwayes happens that the relaxed part is carried to the contrary part, for that is drawn by the Muscle that caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Action, which contraction of the perverse Cheeke happens by reason of the shortnesse of its Muscle, for, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry motion that proceedes from the will seemes to be done by the attraction of the Muscles to those parts whence they arise, neither could the attraction of the other Cheeke be done unlesse the opposite Muscle were drawn back to

its originall, whence it appeares that the Depraved figure of the Mouth or Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the function of the voluntary mover hurt, called by Physicians the <hi>Cynique Spasme,</hi> which this action seemes to counterfeit, by this account differs onely from the Naturall, that it is done besides our will, the Convulsion driving the Nerves and Muscles to the same affect, to which they are led by the Animall Faculty when they keepe their naturall habit; the Muscles are contracted into their proper heades, and with them they rivell that part into which they are inserted, which indeede is common to the naturall and praeter-naturall Plaise-mouth or Dog-Spasme.

these parts, which some not knowing, by an over free cutting of the transverse fibres overthwart, have caused both Cheekes to run as plucked to one side.

From the signification of Detraction which this Scheme or figure of motion aptly expresseth, this Muscle may retaine the name of <hi>Musculus Detrahens,</hi> and be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Detracter, Detractions by <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> being aptly called <hi>Detrahentia labra,</hi> Detracting lips, alluding for all wee know to this action of the Cheekes, the Lips alwayes moving, when this square Muscle moves, which is common to them and the Cheekes.</p>

But they all upon occasion receive action and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the command of the Will. These Muscles of the Lips are so ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the skin, that the fibres do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersect themselves acrosse, from whence the motions of the Lips are very divers, for, because the fibres are diversly mingled and enfolded together, being of two kinds, the Externall, and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, they do not only bring forth <hi>Divers,</hi> but <hi>Contrary</hi> motions. But the <hi>Commistion</hi> of the Lips with the skin is most admirable; for here you cannot
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59598:119"/>
say they are laid under, and that they do adhere and cleave to above, as in the Front and other parts of both the Jaws, seeing that in these, we can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish and determinate in perspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous limits, where the Muscle truly ends, and when the skin ariseth. But in the Lips the permistion is so through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, that both are abolished and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in one another, as you cannot say this is a <hi>Muscle,</hi> and this skin, which is common and conflate of both, neither in the whole, or if you should divide them in parts, but you may rightly call them either <hi>cutaceous Muscles,</hi> or a <hi>Musculous skin. Galen</hi> where he reckons the severall kinds of skins in the Body, counts this the fourth kind, in which the Muscles are lost, (and as we may so say) confounded together with it; for, the foure beginnings of those Muscles which come to the Lips are perspicuous indeed, and manifest before they are mingled with the skin; but afterwards are to be found no more, and cannot be separated from its substance; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he holds it worth our serious consideration, whether Anatomists

But <hi>Columbus</hi> and most Anatomists are of the contrary opinion. <hi>Galen</hi> indeed is very Scepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call about this motion and hath placed it among doubtfull and obscure moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which he was not well satisfied <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for sayes he, the Tongue doth not seeme when it is extended out in length to go uniformely out of the mouth, for it covers the lower Lip and descends somewhat to the Chin, and that is by reason of the Bridle which is beneath it before, we find not the cause by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereof the Tongue is prolix or prolonged untill it be visibly put out of the mouth. No motion obeyes the will but the motion of a Muscle and no Muscle continued to the tongue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it untill it bring it forth of the mouth, hence for good reason we fall to staggering when wee would know after what manner this action of the Tongue is done, and if any motion could bee found in the Body which is done by the will without any Muscle
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59598:128"/>
there had no ambiguity fallen into this question. Indeed there is a rarity and porofity in the Tongue as in the virile member, but that there should bee such virtue in it as we observe the appetite to instill into that Petulant part so that it moves with competent motion and thrusts it selfe out of the mouth, how this should bee done that is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered. And yet the action in kissing, which some beastly Leachers use when their veines are inflate with lust would enduce one to think that there were some analogy between the extension of these two unruly members. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the erection of both parts is that the virile member is not onely encreased in length but in thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and compasse: but the Tongue onely in length being not increased in all the dimensions of its body when it goes out of the mouth. And because they who use this Action of the Tongue doe it before they can thinke or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand with what Muscle or motion they should produce it, it is agreeable &amp; meete that the Muscle whose lust was imposed upon it, for this reason should
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59598:128"/>
neurr a Satyriasis when it avoucheth lust, and imagines by the aptitude of the thing unto it. So that the cause propinque of the Egresse of the Tongue out of the mouth and of <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>iapisme</hi> is a thing of very subtile Speculation. It is no marveile that the Tongue volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily is moved onely by the Muscle. But there is a virtue in it by which it doth indeed weigh what the Intellect doth desire. So that it may move it selfe with motion for a competent Egresse out of the mouth, which doubt in effect insinuates the Tongue it selfe to be a Muscle, although he speakes not plainely out. But according to the most received opinion this significant action of the Tongue is attributed to the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the paire of Muscles called <hi>Geneoglossum</hi> or <hi>Extrahens Linguam,</hi> which arising from the asperitity which is in the midle of the lower Mandible, but is in the internall Face, is inserted neere the roote of the Tongue; this paire contracted, puts forth the Tongue beyond the Teeth and Lips, which paire in respect of this ironicall action performed by it, according to our

manner shall be called <hi>Cynoglossum,</hi> the Liller, Dog-muscle, or the Blaring <hi>Cynique</hi>; or the Muscle of Contumeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Despight. And there is something remarkable in the principle of this motion deserving to be remembred, which <hi>Fernelius</hi> and <hi>Bauhinus</hi> have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, according to whom, it is the onely Muscle of the Body that is the opifex of two contrary motions, and hath no fellow; for, every one hath but his simple action whereby it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to its Head, and the Originall of the Nerve: But the greatest part of the fibres of these Muscles is carryed to the roote of the Tongue, but the small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of them towards the Tip, so that the parts of the same Muscle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce contrary actions, for, with the greatest part of the fibres drawing to their originall, the Tongue is put forth without the Teeth and Lips: but the lesser part of them working, they recall it in, to which revocation some assigne the next paire <hi>Hypsioglossj</hi> which was appointed by nature to withdraw the Tongue straight back; otherwise as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantius</hi> well observes it would follow,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59598:129"/>
that the same Muscle would be both en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with a double action; and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the same time both act and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, which is both contrary to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and the placits of <hi>Galen.</hi> And it falls not within the compasse of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding how this out-drawer of the Tongue should performe that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed office, for it seemes to mee by its Originall to be onely qualified with a power to draw the Tongue to the Chin, and therefore I am gravel'd with <hi>Galen</hi> about the manner of this motion, yet am withall inclinable to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Fernelius,</hi> a ferious and an honest man, who sayes, that because no Nerve is inserted outwardly in the Tip of the Tongue, which should draw or thrust it out, it is more probable to attribut [this ironicall eduction of the Tongue] to that Muscle, then with some to confesse, that there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine voluntary motions in us, whereof no Muscle or Nerve is the author.</p>
