            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>PASSING by <hi>Benjamin Cool</hi>'s Falſe and Unchriſtian
Accuſations againſt me, for which he gives no Proof,
of my <hi>Envy, Malice, Pride,</hi> &amp;c. I ſhall firſt of all briefly
take notice of his Threefold Charge againſt me, in his
Preface Pag 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That the Deſign of my Synopſis,</hi> which he faith is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of all my late Writings againſt them Contracted, <hi>is to
render the Quakers ſuch as diſown the Authority of the Holy Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the promiſed Meſſiah there Teſtified of, who was
Born of the Virgin, was not the Son of God. [<hi>He ſhould have
added,</hi> Properly.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Hiſtory of Chriſts Incarnation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not
neceſſary to our Salvation. Theſe, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> are the three grand
Pillars on which his whole Fabrick ſtands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And theſe, <hi>he ſaith,</hi>
are ſo many palpable Vntruths.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> That theſe three are the Subſtance of all my late
Writings againſt them, is a falſe Aſſertion; for I have Proved
many other things againſt them in my late Writings, that are
as Subſtantial as any of thoſe Three; but that I may not Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs,
I ſhall wave that part at preſent, and ſhall allow my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary,
that theſe three mentioned by him, are very great and
conſiderable, which I Charge all the <hi>Quakers</hi> to be Guilty of,
who own the Books of the Quakers Teachers and Authors
Quoted by me, to give a true account of their Faith and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions:
And particularly I charge <hi>William Pen,</hi> as well as
<hi>George Whitehead,</hi> to be guilty of all the Three, and <hi>Benjamin
Cool</hi> as much as any of them.</p>
            <p>Now let us ſee how <hi>Benjamin Cool</hi> defends <hi>William Pen</hi> from
being guilty of my Charge, with reſpect to theſe three things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:109150:3"/>
My Firſt Charge againſt <hi>William Pen,</hi> and his Brethren, is,
<hi>That he diſowns the Authority of the Holy Scriptures.</hi> The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of this Charge I gave in my <hi>Synopſis,</hi> particularly in <hi>Art.</hi> 1.
where I bring in <hi>William Pen</hi> arguing againſt the Scriptures
being the General Rule of Faith, and Life, <hi>Becauſe all Men have
not the Scripture, and becauſe of their Vncertainty (unleſs upon the
ground of Inward Extraordinary Revelation) and for their Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
and many other Reaſons given by him in the following Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
[<hi>viz.</hi> of his Diſcourſe of the General Rule of Faith, and
Life] to the number of about Fourteen, all which 14 Reaſons
1 Printed in my Late Book, called, <hi>The Deiſm of</hi> William Pen,
<hi>and his Brethren,</hi> Printed in the Year 1699. And gave An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
particularly to every one of them, to which I refer my
Reader. [Such as deſire to have the ſaid Book, may Buy it
at the <hi>Three Pigeons,</hi> againſt the <hi>Royal Exchange</hi> in <hi>Cornhill,
London.</hi>] Where I do not blame <hi>William Pen</hi> for aſſerting,
That the Scriptures are not the General Rule to all Mankind
of Faith and Practice, for I know none who ever ſaid they
were; but I blame him for Aſſerting, <hi>That all Mankind have
one General Rule of Faith and Practice,</hi> to wit, of equal Extent
and Latitude to Heathens and Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in Page 28 of that Book, called,</hi> The Deiſm of <hi>William
Pen,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I ſhew,</hi> That he ought to have diſtinguiſhed between the
General Law, or Rule of Juſtice, given to all Mankind, and the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
added Law, and Rule of Chriſtian Faith and Practice, given in
general to Chriſtians. <hi>Now, that I charge</hi> William Pen <hi>with
holding the Scriptures to be Uncertain (unleſs upon the ground
of Inward Extraordinary Revelation) What ſaith</hi> B. Cool <hi>in
his Defence?</hi> Becauſe, <hi>ſaith he, Page 4. W. Pen</hi> ſaith the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are Vncertain, as to Number, ſince many Writings are loſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
He would render us denyers of the Certainty of the Matter therein
contained; than which nothing is more untrue.</p>
            <p>Note, <hi>Reader,</hi> The falſhood and dull Sophiſtry of <hi>B. Cool,</hi>
as if my Charge againſt <hi>W. Pen</hi> were mainly grounded upon
his ſaying <hi>The Scriptures were Vncertain as to the Number, ſince
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109150:3"/>
many Writings are Loſt,</hi> &amp;c. whereas I do not make uſe of that
Argument againſt him, as my Only, or Chiefeſt, either in my
<hi>Synopſis,</hi> or my Book called <hi>Deiſme;</hi> for having diligently
ſearched both, cannot find it in the <hi>Synopſis</hi> at all, and but very
tranſiently in my Book of <hi>Deiſme.</hi> If <hi>B. Cool</hi> thinks to help
himſelf, from being guilty of Falſhood, and falſe Quotation, by
Concealing the principal part of the Truth, by his addition of
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> that will but the more diſcover his diſingenuity. I ſhall
therefore for the Readers Satisfaction, to clear my Innocency,
and detect both <hi>W. Pen</hi>'s Guilt in his moſt Unchriſtian way of
Arguing <hi>againſt the Scriptures Authority, and their being the Rule
of Faith and Practiſe to Chriſtians; and alſo</hi> B. Cool'<hi>s ſordid and
decitful way of defending him,</hi> Quote ſome places out of <hi>W. Pen</hi>'s
general Diſcourſe of the Rule of Faith and Practice, and which
I have very fully Quoted in my Book of <hi>Deiſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In his 13th Page of his Diſcourſe aforeſaid,</hi> W. Pen <hi>thus
Argueth againſt the Scriptures being the Rule ſo much as to
Chriſtians:</hi> They are not in the Original, becauſe that is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant;
nor in the Copies, becauſe there are Thirty and above in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and 'tis Vndetermin'd, and, for ought we ſee, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> Vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable.
And the variety of Readings amongſt thoſe Copies,
amount to ſeveral Thouſands; and if the Copies cannot, how can the
Tranſlations be the Rule? <hi>And then Argueth againſt their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Rule, from divers of the Books of Scripture, becauſe
Rejected by ſome, and Received by others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Concerning which way of</hi> W. Pen'<hi>s Arguing againſt the
Scriptures being the Rule, I ſay, in my Book of</hi> Deiſme, <hi>Pag</hi> 70.
All which Pleas, both of <hi>Deiſts,</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> have been abundantly
Anſwered by <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Writers. See Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi>'s Book, called,
<hi>The Rule of Faith;</hi> in Anſwer to <hi>J. S.</hi> a Papiſt, whoſe Arguments
againſt the Scriptures being the Rule of Faith, are ſo much of the
ſame ſort with theſe here of <hi>W. Pen</hi>'s, as if he had taken them from
him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again, in his Page 26, he thus proceeds.</hi> The Scriptures are
not the Rule of Faith, and Life, becauſe they cannot be the Rule in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109150:4"/>
their Tranſlations. Suppoſing the Ancient Copies were Exact, it
cannot be the Rule to far the greateſt part of Mankind: Indeed,
<hi>ſaith he,</hi> to none but Learned Men, which neither anſwers the Promiſe
relating to Goſpel times, which is Vniverſal, nor the Neceſſity of all
Mankind, for a Rule of Faith and Life.</p>
            <p>I leave it to Impartial Readers, whether the Quotations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
given, recited faithfully by me, out of <hi>W. Pen</hi>'s <hi>Diſcourſe
of the General Rule of Faith and Practice;</hi> and alſo out of my
Book of <hi>Deiſme,</hi> againſt <hi>W. Pen,</hi> of which Book my <hi>Synopſis</hi>
was but a ſort of <hi>Index,</hi> do not ſufficiently prove <hi>W. Pen</hi>'s Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing
the Authority of the Scriptures, for their want of
Certainty, unleſs upon the ground of <hi>Inward Extraordinary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi>
as I did particularly expreſs it, both in my Book of
<hi>Deiſm</hi> and <hi>Synopſis:</hi> And it could be nothing but a wilful
omiſſion in <hi>B. Cool</hi> not to take notice of thoſe Paſſages above
cited; For ſuppoſe he had not known of my Book of <hi>Deiſme</hi>
againſt <hi>W. Pen,</hi> yet he could not be Ignorant, that there was
ſuch a Book as <hi>W. Pen</hi>'s Diſcourſe of the General Rule of
Faith and Practice, out of which I had taken my aboveſaid
Quotations.</p>
            <p>But for a further Evidence, that <hi>W. Pen,</hi> in his ſaid Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
did Argue againſt the Certainty of the Matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in the Scriptures, with reſpect to the chief peculiar
Doctrines of Chriſtianity, as the Orthodox Faith of the Holy
Trinity, againſt the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> and the Orthodox
Faith of all ſound Proteſtants, againſt the Papiſts, about Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,
I Quote him at large in my Book of <hi>Deiſme,</hi>
Arguing in his Diſcourſe of the General Rule of Faith and
Practiſe thus, pag 41, 42. <hi>Is there any place</hi> [<hi>in Scripture</hi>] <hi>tells
us</hi> (ſaith <hi>W. Pen) without Interpretation, whether the</hi> Socinian,
<hi>or</hi> Trinitarian <hi>be in the right, in their differing apprehenſions of the
Three that bear record,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Alſo the</hi> Homouſian <hi>and</hi> Arian,
<hi>about Chriſt's Divinity, or the</hi> Papiſts <hi>and</hi> Proteſtants <hi>about Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation.
If then things are left Vndefin'd, and Vndetermin'd,
I mean Literally, and Expreſſly in the Scripture; and that the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109150:4"/>
Queſtion ariſes about the Senſe of Words, doth the Scripture deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
which of theſe Interpreters hit the mark?</hi> Thus far <hi>W. Pen.</hi>
From all which he concludes, That not the Scripture, but the
Interpretation muſt decide the matter in Controverſie; and
that Interpretation muſt be given, not by the Scripture ſo
much as Inſtrumentally, but from the Spirit of God [by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Revelation] to be a True and Infallible Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
and yet that extraordinary Revelation is not neceſſary
to be given to any of the <hi>Quakers</hi> (as <hi>W. Pen</hi> confeſſeth) nor is
given to them, as will after appear from what follows to be
Quoted out of him.</p>
            <p>Judge, Reader, doth not <hi>W. Pen</hi> here make the Matter of
the Scripture Uncertain, with reſpect to theſe great matters of
Chriſtianity, the Orthodox Doctrine of the Holy Trinity, and
the denyal of Tranſubſtantiation, without inward extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Revelation; and yet <hi>B. Cool</hi> is ſo ſhameleſs, to blame
me, for ſaying, The <hi>Quakers</hi> deny the Certainty of the Matter
contained in the Scripture, than which (he ſaith) nothing is
more untrue.</p>
            <p>Now if <hi>B. Cool</hi> thinks he, or his Brerhren, have any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
extraordinary Revelation, to determine the Truth of
the Matter concerning theſe great Articks of the Trinity,
and denyal of Tranſubſtantiation, let him Aſſert it, and next
let him Prove it, otherwiſe we have no reaſon to believe
him, or them; but their aſſerting it is ſufficient argument to
prove my Charge againſt them, and particularly againſt <hi>W.
Pen,</hi> That the Matter of Scripture, with reſpect to the chief
and principal Doctrines of Chriſtianity, is uncertain to Men,
without extraordinary inward Revelation; whereby he
means ſuch as the Prophets and Apoſtles had without Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>But for a further Confirmation that <hi>B. Cool</hi> is a falſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer
of me, in this very particular, and that I am unjuſtly
charged by him, I have in my Book, called, <hi>The Deiſme of</hi> W.
Pen, brought Fourteen of <hi>W. Pen</hi>'s Arguments out of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:109150:5"/>
of the General Rule of Faith and Practiſe; to all, and
every one of which, I have particularly Anſwered. Whereby
<hi>W. Pen</hi> Eſſayeth to prove, That the Scripture is not the Rule
of Faith and Practiſe to Chriſtians. One of which is from their
Imperfection; another, from their Uncertainty; a third, from
their Obſcurity. And in his 10th Page, he Argues againſt the
Scriptures being the Rule, <hi>That a Rule ought to be Plain, Proper,
and Intelligible,</hi> which he pleads the Scriptures are not.</p>
            <p>Now, I ſay, <hi>W. Pen,</hi> and his Brethren, yea, and <hi>B. Cool</hi>
with them, diſown the Authority of the Scriptures, becauſe
they deny them to be the Rule of Faith and Practiſe, to wit,
the primary Rule of Faith and Practiſe, with reſpect to all
things Commanded us to be Believ'd or Practis'd. For as
concerning the Heathens, who have not the Scripture, I know
none who Aſſerts that the Scripture is a Rule to them.</p>
            <p>But that not only <hi>W. Pen,</hi> but <hi>B. Cool,</hi> is guilty in aſſerting
the Scriptures not to be ſo much as the Rule in part to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
who have the Scriptures, we have his plain Confeſſion,
page 4 of his Preface, where he concludes, but by a falſe Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſm,
<hi>That there is but one General Rule, both to them who have
the Scriptures,</hi> i. e. profeſs'd Chriſtians, <hi>and to them who have them
not,</hi> viz. the Heathens. The word <hi>But</hi> in that place is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive
of the Scriptures being the Rule any more to profeſs'd
Chriſtians than to Heathens, ſeeing, by his Argument, both
have <hi>but</hi> one Rule, which he would have to follow from ſome
of my words he quotes; but he inferrs his Concluſion by a
falſe Syllogiſme, which is this, <hi>If</hi> (ſaith <hi>B. Cool) the Scripture
cannot be ſavingly Believed and Vnderſtood but by the Revelation
and Inward Illumination of the Spirit, then the Spirit is the primary
Rule, even for Believing the Scriptures themſelves; but the firſt is
true, therefore the laſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Conſequence of his firſt Propoſition is falſe, the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood
of which can be Demonſtrated by the like falſe and
fallacious Argument following; <hi>If a Bricklayer, Joyner, or
Carpenter cannot ſee to work their Trades without Light, therefore
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109150:5"/>
the Light is the Rule whereby they Work, either Primary, or Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary.</hi>
But the falſity of this is apparent; for none ever thought
that the Light either of Sun, Moon, or Candle, is the Rule,
either Primary, or Secondary, whereby Tradeſmen, as Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layers,
Joyners, or Carpenters do Work; for the Rule, or
Rules whereby they Work, are one thing; and the Light which
lets them See how to uſe their Rule, is another thing: Or as if
<hi>B. Cool</hi> ſhould Argue, the Grindſtone makes the Knife or Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor
ſharp, therefore the Grindſtone is more ſharp than both,
or is Primarily ſharp, and the Knife or Razor ſharp but Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily.
This Example I only uſe to ſhew the falſhood of that
Maxim applied in the Caſe, That for which a thing is ſuch,
that thing is the more ſuch. But to Argue, That the Spirit is
the Rule, becauſe the Spirit enlightens and inables true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
to underſtand the Scriptures, is as Weak and Sophiſtical,
as to argue, becauſe a Bricklayer teacheth a Man that is his
Apprentice, to lay the Bricks upon a Wall, that therefore the
Bricklayer is the Rule; whereas the Bricklayer is not the Rule
to the Apprentice, but his Rule and Maſter. And to Affirm,
That the Spirit is the Rule, is to confound the Agent with the
Inſtrument by which he works; and is as great nonſenſe, as to
make the Bricklayer to be the wooden Rule, and Line, and
Plummet by which he works. And the like Fallacy have all
his other Arguments, whereby he would infer, from ſome of
my words he quotes out of my former Books, That I held
there was <hi>but</hi> one General Rule, both to profeſs'd Chriſtians
and Heathens; and Conſequently, that if this proves <hi>William Pen</hi>
guilty of <hi>Deiſme,</hi> it equally (as <hi>B. Cool</hi> infers) proves <hi>G. Keith</hi>
guilty of the ſame. But I deny his Conſequence, for I do not
remember that ever I ſo Aſſerted, or Argued, as <hi>W. Pen</hi> hath
done, or as <hi>B. Cool</hi> now doth, That profeſſed Chriſtians and
Heathens have <hi>but</hi> one General Rule.</p>
            <p>But whereas, in ſome of my former Writings, I had dropt
ſome Unwary and Unſound Expreſſions, in calling the Spirit,
with reſpect to the peculiar Principle of Chriſtianity, <hi>The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:109150:6"/>
Rule,</hi> yet I deny that this proves me guilty of <hi>Deiſme;</hi>
ſeeing to the beſt of my knowledge and remembrance, I never
made the Profeſſed Chriſtians and the Heathens, to have <hi>but</hi>
one General Rule of Faith and Practiſe; for I always diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
betwixt the common Illumination of the Spirit given
to Heathens and all Mankind, and the ſpecial given to true
Chriſtians, in the uſe of the Written Word; which being two
differing things, tho' both coming from one Author, ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
clears me, that I was never a <hi>Deiſt,</hi> whatever leſſer Errors,
or Miſtakes I had when amongſt the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But hath <hi>B. Cool</hi> forgot the Proverb, <hi>That two Blacks makes
not one White;</hi> ſuppoſe <hi>G. K.</hi> dropt ſome unwary Expreſſions,
that, contrary to his intentions, did favour <hi>Deiſme,</hi> will that
excuſe <hi>W. Pen</hi> of his <hi>Deiſme,</hi> or <hi>B. Cool,</hi> and the <hi>Quakers</hi> of
their <hi>Deiſme,</hi> which can be prov'd, not barely from a few inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
Expreſſions dropt from their Pens, but from whole
Books and Volumes they have filled with meer <hi>Deiſt</hi> Notions,
ſtriking at all the Foundations of Chriſtianity, ſpecial and
peculiar thereunto?</p>
            <p>And I have this Advantage of <hi>W. Pen,</hi> and all others of his
Brethren, That not only in my Book of Retractations, I have
Retracted and Corrected many things, both in Particular, and
in General, whatever I have Said, or Writ contrary to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture, but none of Them have done any ſuch thing in
the leaſt; but alſo in Particular, in my Book, called, <hi>The Deiſme
of</hi> W. Pen, <hi>and his Brethren,</hi> page 4. I have Corrected my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
and Error, in calling (in ſome of my former Books) <hi>The
Spirits Inward Evidence, ſealing to the truth of the peculiar Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of Chriſtianity contained in the Scripture, the Principal Rule
of Faith.</hi> Which I thus did correct, <hi>That the Spirits Inward
Evidence was not the Rule of Faith at all, to us Chriſtians, but the
principal objective Medium, or Motive of Credibility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I having thus Retracted my Errors, and Corrected the
ſame, before I either Publiſh'd, or Writ my <hi>Synopſis,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
long before <hi>B. Cool</hi> writ his pretended Anſwer to it,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109150:6"/>
he has dealt moſt Unfairly and Diſingenuouſly with me, to
Charge me with what I have Ingenuouſly and Fairly Retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted:
And the ſame Anſwer may ſerve to all the other Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he brings out of my Books, to ſet me as deep in the Mire
of <hi>Deiſme,</hi> as <hi>W. Pen,</hi> or himſelf; which had I been as guilty as
they, is no vindication to them. And but that it would be an
improper Digreſſion, and too much divert the Reader, I could
eaſily ſhew, that none of all his Quotations out of my former
Books, prove me guilty of <hi>Deiſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſeeing I have Retracted, both in Particular and General,
what did ſeem, tho' but remotely and indirectly, to favour
any unſound Notions about the Rule of the Chriſtian Faith;
and have in my <hi>Catechiſme,</hi> both Larger and Leſſer, Aſſerted
<hi>The Holy Scriptures to be the only Rule of Faith and Practiſe, to all
Chriſtians, with reſpect to all the peculiar Articles of the Chriſtian
Faith, and to all the poſitive Precepts peculiarly belonging to the
Chriſtian Religion:</hi> Therefore I appeal to all Impartial Readers,
whether <hi>B. Cool,</hi> and his <hi>Briſtol</hi> Brethren, who approve of his
Book, are not highly Injurious to me? Even as much, as if ſome
<hi>Romaniſt</hi> ſhould charge all the Popiſh Errors upon <hi>Luther,</hi> after
he had Renounced them; or ſuppoſe upon ſome <hi>Quaker</hi> that
had formerly been a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> as I ſuppoſe B. <hi>Cool</hi> knoweth
ſome of the <hi>Quakers</hi> to have been.</p>
            <p>But the diſtinction of <hi>Primary</hi> and <hi>Secondary</hi> Rule, uſed by
<hi>W. Pen</hi> and <hi>B. Cool,</hi> will not do, to defend them from <hi>Deiſme,</hi>
as I have ſhewed in my Book of <hi>Deiſme,</hi> page 56. <hi>W. Pen</hi> is ſo
ſeemingly kind to the Scriptures, that he grants them to be a
Subordinate, Secondary, and Declaratory Rule, in his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe
of the General Rule, page 25. <hi>Such a Subordinate, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary,
and Declaratory Rule</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we never ſaid ſeveral
parts were not.</hi> Obſerve, Reader, he will not allow all the parts
of Scripture, but only ſome parts of it, to be ſo much as a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate,
Secondary, and Declaratory Rule. Though even
the Ceremonial Precepts, he has as great reaſon to believe
them to be the Word of God, and conſequently a Rule of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:109150:7"/>
Faith (tho' not of Practiſe) to us, as truly as any other parts
of Scripture.</p>
            <p>That the Scriptures are not a Subordinate and Secondary
Rule (as both <hi>W. Pen</hi> and <hi>B. Cool</hi> have affirmed them to be)
but the Primary and Only Rule, with reſpect to all the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Doctrines and Precepts of the Chriſtian Religion, I have
clearly and fully prov'd, in my Book of <hi>Deiſme,</hi> page 56, 57.
The ſubſtance of what I have there ſaid, I ſhall here tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
as followeth.</p>
            <p>Seeing every Subordinate and Secondary Rule preſuppoſeth a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
Rule, which hath no dependency on the Secondary; tho' the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary
is wholly from the Primary, as the Tranſcript is wholly from
the Original, but the Original is intirely compleat and perfect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Copy, or Tranſcript. It is evident, that according to him,
<hi>(viz. W. Pen)</hi> he hath all what he thinketh to be a Divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Faith, wholly from his Primary Rule, and nothing from the
Scriptures, which he calls the Secondary; for the excellency of the
Primary Rule is, that it teacheth all that is to be Divinely Known,
or Believ'd, without the need or help of any Secondary Rule, otherwiſe
it ſhould not be Primary, nor ſhould the Scriptures, in that caſe, be
a Subordinate Rule, but Co-ordinate, and of equal Dignity, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
and Vſe, with what he calls the Primary: For whatever is a
primary, full, adequate and perfect Rule, ſuch as he will have only the
<hi>Light Within;</hi> or by whatever other Name he defines it, it muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to him, all the <hi>Credenda</hi> and <hi>Agenda, i.e.</hi> all things he ought
to Believe and Practiſe, without any other Rule whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Surely as he who hath the Original, has no need of the Copy, nor
great uſe of it for himſelf, ſo if <hi>W. Pen</hi> hath ſuch a perfect, compleat,
primary Rule, that teacheth him without Scripture, all that he ought
to Know, Believe, or Practiſe, I cannot underſtand of what great
uſe the Scripture can be unto him; or at leaſt it is of no neceſſity to
him, this primary Rule <hi>[The Light Within]</hi> hath taught him all
before hand, otherwiſe it is not primary.</p>
            <p>This Argument I have produc'd againſt <hi>W. Pen,</hi> is of equal
force againſt <hi>B. Cool,</hi> and his <hi>Briſtol</hi> Brethren, and the <hi>Quakers</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:109150:7"/>
in general, who affirm they have this Primary Rule, and are
come to be Taught by it <hi>whatever</hi> is to be known of God; as
<hi>W. Pen,</hi> in his Diſcourſe of the General Rule of Faith and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe,
p. 21. affirmeth; and giveth for his proof, that place in
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19. which he groſſly Perverteth, by wreſting and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
the Text, making it ſay, what it ſaith not; for thus he
Quotes it, <hi>WHATEVER might be known of God, was manifeſt
within; for God who is Light, hath ſhewn it unto them.</hi> But the
word <hi>Whatever</hi> is neither in the Engliſh Tranſlation, nor is
there any word in the Greek that can be ſo Tranſlated. St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
in that above quoted place, is not treating of the knowledge
of God given to Chriſtians, by ſpecial Illumination, in the uſe
of the Scriptures, diſcovering the great Love of God, by the
Redemption of the World, through Jeſus Chriſt, as he gave
himſelf to Dye for us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but of the knowledge of his Eternal
Power and Godhead given to the Heathen, by the works of
Creation, and the common Illumination given to all Mankind.</p>
            <p>What <hi>B. Cool</hi> Quotes out of <hi>W. Pen</hi>'s Diſcourſe of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Rule of Faith and Life, in his ſeeming praiſe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
in his 6th page, can be judged no other, but like <hi>Judas</hi>'s
Kiſs, when he betray'd his Maſter, and a palpable Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
and Inconſiſtency both to himſelf and Brethren, for
which they are accountable; but is no argument of my Inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
as <hi>B. Cool</hi> doth moſt falſly and unjuſtly accuſe me. For
while he argueth againſt the Scriptures being the great and
only Rule of Faith and Practiſe, to Chriſtians, with reſpect to
all the peculiar Doctrines and Precepts of Chriſtianity, and
gives that Office to the <hi>Light Within,</hi> as common to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
<hi>Jews, Turks, Heathens, Infidels;</hi> and yet, as it were with
the ſame Breath, extols the Scriptures, calling them <hi>The Bleſſed
Scriptures of Truth, and that the</hi> Quakers <hi>moſt heartily believe them
to have been given forth from the ſame Holy Spirit, and are a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the mind and will of God; and as ſuch, are obliging upon
all that have, and can have them, both in reference to Faith and
Practiſe: And we utterly diſclaim and renounce all Doctrines and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:109150:8"/>
Practiſes repugnant to them.</hi> He ſeemes, like ſome Rebelious
Subject, who being accus'd, that he denies the Kings Laws,
falls out in high Praiſes of them, but all this while doth not
own them to be the Kings, but ſets up other Laws in their
place. But ſeeing <hi>B. Cool</hi> thinks, that <hi>W. Pen</hi> hath ſaid enough
in commendation of the Scriptures, to prove <hi>G. Keith</hi> diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous,
for blaming him for Diſputing againſt their being the
Rule, from their Uncertainty, either as to their Original, or
Copies, or Tranſlations; all which he hath laboured (as the
Papiſts do to ſet up their Tradition) to render uncertain, and
that they do not determine (without extraordinary Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
whether the Papiſts or Proteſtants are right about Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,
or the Socinians and ſound Proteſtants are right
about the Trinity. I freely leave it to the Impartial Reader,
whether <hi>B. Cool</hi> has not moſt unjuſtly blam'd me for Diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity;
and whether <hi>B. Cool</hi> himſelf be not ſordidly diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
and fallacious in this very matter, as well as in other
matters hereafter to be treated of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But further to diſcover</hi> B. Cool'<hi>s groſs Ignorance in his way
of Arguing againſt the Scriptures</hi> being the only Rule, excluſive of
the Spirit [<hi>to wit</hi> from being the Rule] for that <hi>(he ſaith)</hi> were to
prefer the Effect before the Cauſe, ſince the Light (Chriſt) was before
the Scripture was, and by him were they given forth, through Holy
Men, for our Profit and Edification.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> O rare Logician! As if to diſtinguiſh between the
Workman and the Rule, Square, or Inſtrument by which he
worketh, were to prefer the Effect (<hi>to wit,</hi> the Rule) to the
Cauſe, <hi>to wit,</hi> to him that uſeth it, and hath made it for his uſe.
But tho' the Spirit gave forth the Scriptures, and did firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
the great Truths delivered in them, concerning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of the World by Jeſus Chriſt, unto certain Holy
Men, peculiarly choſen for that work, yet the Spirit was not
the Rule even to them, but what the Spirit Reveal'd to them,
was the Rule of their Faith, before the Scripture was writ;
and what the Spirit thus inwardly Reveal'd to them, as to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:109150:8"/>
               <hi>Abraham, Moſes, &amp;c.</hi> I grant was the Rule to them, and their
primary and only Rule; but that it follows, that that inward
Revelation, which they had, was, or is the primary and only
Rule to us, is a moſt falſe Conſequence; unleſs on the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
that we, and all the Chriſtians, as well as Quakers, have
the ſame inward Revelation, in kind, that the Prophets had;
and if <hi>B. Cool</hi> will ſay, they have it, the ſame in kind, then
they have it without Scripture, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo had it.
But if they have it not without Scripture, but that their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Faith of theſe great Truths, particularly that one
great Truth, That the Son of God was Incarnate, for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Men, doth neceſſarily depend upon the Written Word,
as the inſtrument by which the Spirit doth Illuminate, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
them to Believe, and Underſtand the Written Word, or
Truths declared in Scripture; this is no proof that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
is not the Rule, <hi>to wit,</hi> The great and only Rule; but is
indeed a ſufficient and clear proof, that the Scripture is the
Rule, and the Spirit is the Ruler, or he that by the Rule, as
his Inſtrument, Rules and Leads our Minds both to Believe
the Scripture and Underſtand it; and alſo rightly to Apply it
for our Edification.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine which <hi>W. Pen,</hi> and <hi>B. Cool,</hi> with their Breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
do ſet up, of making the Spirits Internal Revelation, the
Univerſal and Primary Rule of their Faith and Practiſe, doth
neceſſarily oblige them to hold alſo, That all what they Know,
or Believe of God, and of Chriſt, is from the ſame Internal
Extraordinary Revelation and Diſcovery, in kind, that the
Prophets and Apoſtles had. For according to the Argument I
have uſed above, and recited out of my Book of <hi>Deiſme,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>W. Pen,</hi> if the Internal Revelation that the <hi>Quakers</hi>
have, be the Primary Rule of all the Faith and Knowledge
they have of God and Chriſt, it hath no dependance on the
Scriptures, or Written word, ſo much as an Outward, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Means; as the Original depends not on the Copy, but
the Copy depends on the Original; and this indeed is perfectly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:109150:9"/>
agreeing with the <hi>Quakers</hi> great Apoſtle <hi>George Fox,</hi> whom
<hi>W. Pen,</hi> and <hi>B. Cool</hi> alſo, ſo highly Magnifie; <hi>For,</hi> ſaith <hi>G. Fox</hi>
in his <hi>Great Myſtery,</hi> Page 350. <hi>Ye tell People of an outward ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Means, by which Chriſt communicates the benefits of Redemption.</hi>
[Note, By the outward and ordinary Means, they mean the
written Word and Sacraments.] <hi>The means of Salvation</hi> (ſaith
he) <hi>is not ordinary, nor outward; but Chriſt is the Salvation, who
is Eternal.</hi> Again, <hi>Great</hi> Myſt. p. 133. His Opponent, <hi>T. Moor,</hi>
having ſaid, <hi>The Scriptures is the abſolute Rule, and Medium of
Faith.</hi> In p. 134. <hi>G. Fox</hi> Anſwereth, <hi>The Scriptures is not the
Author, nor the Means of it, nor the Rule, but Chriſt who gave it,
and he increaſeth it.</hi> And in p. 243. <hi>Great Myſt.</hi> he ſaith, <hi>And
the things of the Goſpel, and of the Spirit, are not attained by an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Means.</hi> [<hi>Note,</hi> Here he doth Exclude the Scripture not
only from being the <hi>External</hi> Means, but from being an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi>
Means of their Knowledge and Faith.] Again, p. 320.
His Opponents having ſaid, <hi>God works Faith in us Inwardly, by the
Spirit; and Outwardly, by his Word,</hi> [meaning the written Word.]
He Anſwers, <hi>Here thou goeſt about to make the Word and the Spirit
not one.</hi> Is not the Word Spiritual, and Chriſt called the Word?
Again, p. 168. <hi>Them that never heard the Scripture Outwardly,
the Light that every Man hath that cometh into the World, being
turned to it, with that they will ſee Chriſt; with that they will know
Scripture; with that they will be led out of all Deluſion, come into
Covenant with God; with which they will come to Worſhip God in the
Spirit, and Serve him.</hi> See all theſe, and many more ſuch Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
in my 4th Narative.</p>
            <p>Here we ſee the Scripture is Excluded from being ſo much as either
the Means, or a Means of the Spirits working Faith or Knowledge in
them; and conſequently, what Knowledge, or Faith the <hi>Quakers</hi> have
of God, or Chriſt, it muſt be by inward, immediate, extraordinary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
and Diſcoveries, the ſame in kind that the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
had, as ſuch which was without all outward means. Thus we ſee
the Harmony of <hi>W. Pen,</hi> and <hi>B. Cool</hi> and his Brethren, with their great
Apoſtle <hi>G. Fox.</hi> But let us again view their Diſharmony and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
both with themſelves, and one with another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:109150:9"/>
               <hi>Benjamin Cool,</hi> in his 9th pag, ſaith, <hi>That the Prophets and Apoſtles had
an extraordinary Sight and Senſe of</hi> Adam'<hi>s Fall and</hi> Chriſt'<hi>s Birth,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>I readily own; but that ſuch an extraordinary Diſcovery as they had, is
abſolutely neceſſary to every Mans Salvation, I deny.</hi> But if he will
adhere to his former Aſſertion, That the <hi>Light Within</hi> is the Primary
Rule of every Mans Faith and Knowledge, and to <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Doctrine,
above mentioned, every Man that has the true Knowledge and Faith of
Chriſt, muſt have ſuch an extraordinary Diſcovery as the Prophets and
Apoſtles had, in kind, if not in degree: For ſeeing the <hi>Quakers</hi> plead,
That the true Knowledge and Faith of God and Chriſt muſt be by the
Spirit only, without the outward and ordinary Means, as <hi>G. Fox,</hi> their
great Apoſtle, has Taught them; then it muſt be the ſame, in <hi>kind</hi> at
leaſt, if not in <hi>degree.</hi> And if all the Faithful are not come to the ſame
<hi>degree</hi> of the Spirit that the Prophets and Apoſtles had, Yet if <hi>B. Cool</hi> will
believe their great Apoſtle, ſome of the Quakers, at leaſt, are come not
only to the ſame <hi>degree</hi> that the Prophets and Apoſtles had, who gave
forth the Scriptures, but above any <hi>degree:</hi> For thus he ſaith expreſly,
<hi>Great Myſt.</hi> p. 318. <hi>For who comes to the Spirit, and to Chriſt, comes to that
which is Perfect; who comes to the Kingdom of Heaven in them, comes to be
Perfect, yea, to a Perfect Man;</hi> and that is above any Degree.</p>
            <p>But <hi>B. Cool,</hi> in his following Quotation, (as I can underſtand him,
and let the Reader ſee if he can underſtand him otherwiſe) diſowns all
Extraordinary Diſcovery, ſuch as the Prophets and Apoſtles had, in
Kind as well as in Degree, and wholly takes to the common and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Diſcoveries of the Light Within, Univerſally given to all Mankind;
for thus he ſaith expreſly, <hi>But that the common and ordinary Diſcoveries
of the Light Within, Vniverſally given to Mankind, (as all Mankind Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres
thereto, and Obeys the ſame) is that Vniverſal, or General Rule of Faith
and Life, we ſhall, I hope, never deny.</hi> Now this Univerſal and General Rule,
given to all Mankind, <hi>B. Cool,</hi> if he will accord with his Brethren, and
particularly with <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> and others, in their Book, call'd, <hi>The
Glory of Chriſt's Light Within,</hi> muſt hold it to be a full and compleat
Rule, that needs no addition, yea, not only needs no Addition, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of none; for if it admit of any Addition, then all Mankind have
not one and the ſame Rule of Faith and Practiſe, contrary to the very
ſcope and deſign of <hi>W. Pen</hi>'s Book, called, <hi>A Diſcourſe of the General Rule
of Faith and Practiſe.</hi> But again, If that Addition be but only a Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
Rule, it preſuppoſeth the Primary Rule, <hi>to wit,</hi> the Light Within
them, as Pre-exiſtant, and from which all the Certainty of the Secondary
Rule dependeth, and their Primary Rule firſt giving them the ſaid Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:109150:10"/>
makes the Secondary wholly ſuperfluous. If it be ſaid, that
by the Secondary Men may be led to the Primary, as by the Copy to
the Original, or as by the Stream to the Fountain: But what ſervice
can the Secondary have to lead them to the Primary, as from the more
known, to the more unknown? Seeing the Secondary Rule, which they
call the Scripture, has no Certainty but what it receives from the <hi>Light
Within,</hi> as it is an Univerſal Principle common to all Mankind. But
common Experience teacheth, That the <hi>Light Within,</hi> i.e. the common Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovery,
or Illumination given to all Mankind, that teacheth them ſome
things concerning God as a Creator, and ſome general Moral Duties
to him as ſuch, yet doth not teach them the Knowledge or Faith of God,
as he gave his Son to be Incarnate, for the Redemption of the World;
for that never was known but by ſpecial Revelation, immediately given
to the Prophets, and by their means convey'd to others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B. Cool</hi> proceeds to tell us, page 9. what ſpecial Veneration he and
his Brethren expreſs for the Holy Scriptures, after he hath ſet up the
common and ordinary Diſcoveries of the Light Within, Univerſally
given to all Mankind, to be the Primary Rule of all Faith and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
<hi>Yet at the ſame time, we</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>expreſs our Veneration for the
Verity and Authority of the Holy Scriptures, ſince we know them to be</hi> (as they
are) <hi>an Additional, and Vnſpeakable Benefit for a Rule both of Faith and
Life; and ſuch a Rule too, that whatever is Repugnant thereunto, ought not
to be of any Authority with us.</hi> But judge, Reader, whether this be not
another <hi>Judas</hi> Kiſs; or, as they that Mock'd our Lord with a <hi>Hail
Maſter.</hi> They have a great veneration for the Scriptures, as a Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
and Additional Rule, but they have a far greater for the Common
Diſcovery given to all Mankind by the Light Within, being the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
Rule: Tho' this primary univerſal Rule tells them nothing of
Chriſt, as he was outwardly Born of a Virgin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor any one of the
peculiar Doctrines and Precepts of Chriſtianity; yet, for all that, the
common Diſcovery that Heathens, Jews, Turks, and Infidels have, as
well as the Quakers, is the more Excellent and Venerable. The Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
is but the Servant, or Lackey, to the Primary: The great Truths
of the Goſpel diſcover'd by the Holy Scriptures, through the ſpecial
operation and illumination of the Spirit, not given to Heathens, but
only to faithful Chriſtians, muſt vail, and yeild ſubjection to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Dictates of the Light Within, of Moral Juſtice and Temperance
that Heathens have.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Readers,</hi> what think you of this ſort of Divinity, and deceitful way of
ſhewing his, and their Veneration to the Holy Scripture? But poſſibly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:109150:10"/>
he will ſay, <hi>Muſt not Chriſt, or the Spirit, or God himſelf, who is within all
Men, be preferred to the Scriptures?</hi> And it is Chriſt they hold to be the
primary Rule. But this <hi>Objection</hi> comes from great Ignorance; for
neither God, nor Chriſt, nor the Spirit, can be properly ſaid to be a
Rule, or the Rule in any Man, more than a Workman can be ſaid to be
the Tool, or Inſtrument that he works by. God is certainly Greater,
and more Excellent than the Scripture, and ſo is Chriſt, and the Holy
Spirit, ſo much as the Creator is greater than the Creature: But the
Compariſon is not ſtated betwixt God, or Chriſt, or the Spirit, and
the Scripture, but betwixt the common Illumination given to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
(which is neither God, nor Chriſt, nor the Spirit, but their Effect
and Operation) and the Scripture, which certainly gives a diſcovery of
all the peculiar Doctrines of the Chriſtian Religion, and Precepts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
and there is no need of any other diſcovery, by way of material
Object, but only that the Spirit of God give a Spiritual ſight and ſenſe
of the Truths of the Goſpel already diſcover'd to us in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Laſtly,</hi> How doth this great pretended Veneration, that <hi>B. Cool</hi>
ſeems to have for the Scriptures, agree with the Vile and Contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
Names that <hi>G. Fox,</hi> the Quakers great Apoſtle, has given them?
who, together with <hi>Richard Hubberthorn,</hi> in the Book, called, <hi>Truths
Defence,</hi> did call the Scriptures, page 14, 102. <hi>Earthly, and Carnal,
Death, Ink and Paper, Duſt and Serpents Meat.—And their Goſpel is Duſt,</hi>

            <p>But why (<hi>ſaith</hi> B. Cool <hi>to me in his p.</hi> 9.) <hi>George</hi> ſhould we, by thee, be
rendered ſo Hetrodox, for Vindicating the <hi>Light Within,</hi> both with reſpect to
its Vniverſality and Authority, when thou thy ſelf haſt Writ and Printed the
ſame Truths over and over, and to this day are not to be found amongſt thy
Retractations?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> I never held the Groſs and Abſurd Notions of <hi>the Light With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi>
aſſerted by <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> &amp; <hi>W. Pen,</hi> and the generality of the Teachers
of the Quakers, <hi>viz. That the Light Within is ſufficient to Salvation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any thing elſe,</hi> i. e. Not only without the Scriptures, but without the
Man Chriſt, and his Death, and Sufferings, and precious Blood, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
ſhed for us, and his Mediation for us, without us, now in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
all which are ſome thing elſe than the <hi>Light Within.</hi> Now that
this is the great Offence that the Quakers took againſt me, <hi>That I held,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:109150:11"/>
That the Light Within is not ſufficient to Salvation, without ſomething elſe, is
fairly confeſſed by</hi> G. Whitehead, in his <hi>Antidote,</hi> p. 28. And yet he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth,
that by that <hi>ſomewhat elſe,</hi> I meant <hi>the Man Chriſt Jeſus, as he out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
Died for us.</hi> Far leſs did I ever hold that moſt Abſurd and Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſical
Notion of <hi>G. Fox, That the Quakers have whole Chriſt in them, God
and Man, Fleſh and Spirit, Blood and Bones:</hi> And <hi>that they have His Fleſh
in them, becauſe they Eat it,</hi> as I have prov'd out of his <hi>Great Myſt.</hi> in my
4th <hi>Narative. p.</hi> 107. Nor did I ever confound the <hi>Common Illumination</hi>
given to Heathens, with the <hi>Special Illumination</hi> given to Chriſtians, as the
Quakers generally do, and as I find <hi>B. Cool,</hi> as well as <hi>W. Pen</hi> doth: So
that I can ſay, with a good Conſcience, I never was guilty of their
<hi>Deiſme</hi> and <hi>Paganiſme;</hi> For I always held in my former Writings,
when among the Quakers, <hi>That Faith in Chriſt, God and Man, without us,
yet one Chriſt, is a fundamental Doctrine of Chriſtianity,</hi> and ſo much plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appeareth from that very Book that <hi>B. Cool</hi> hath quoted, called the
<note n="*" place="margin">Note, <hi>Reader,</hi> That Book, called, <hi>The Fundamental Truths of Chriſtianity,</hi> was not Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd by me, nor was ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, by me, to be publiſh'd in that Imperfect manner; but being found in a Manuſcript, unfiniſh'd, was Publiſh'd by another, as the Book it ſelf ſheweth, without my conſent or knowledge, I being then in <hi>America.</hi> See the Preface.</note> 
               <hi>Fundamental Truths of Chriſtianity,</hi> which
tho' he quotes as making againſt me, as my
preſent perſwaſion is, and for him and his
Brethren, yet it makes for me, and againſt
them; for he confeſſeth, that I ſaid in that
Book, [<hi>And I deliver it as one of the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Truths of Chriſtianity,</hi>] <hi>That Chriſt is
come outwardly, as Man, for all.</hi> Now ſeeing
he grants that I deliver'd this, as one of the
<hi>Fundamental Truths of Chriſtianity,</hi> it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
follows, That he who believes not that
Truth, wants a <hi>Fundamental of Chriſtianity,</hi> and is no <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> But
this is quite contrary to <hi>G. Whitehead, W. Pen,</hi> and <hi>B. Cool</hi> alſo, who think
Men may be true Chriſtians without this Faith, if they be <hi>Moral,</hi>
Men <hi>Juſt, Meek,</hi> and <hi>Merciful,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>That there is a <hi>Principle of Light given to all Men, and is in them,</hi> I ſtill
hold; and that it is given them for that end, that they may become the
Children of God, <hi>to wit,</hi> as by a preparatory operation, as Repentance
is preparatory to the Goſpel Faith, and Diſpenſation; and alſo by way
of Concomitancy and Subordination, to a higher Miniſtration of Light
that is given under the Chriſtian Diſpenſation, that is ſpecial only to
Believers in Chriſt, who have Faith in him, either expreſs, or implicit;
I mean in Chriſt, conſider'd as God Man, without us, which I have
fully and ſufficiently clear'd to any Impartial Reader, in my Book of
<hi>Retractations,</hi> p. 13, 19. And therefore <hi>B. Cool</hi> is the more Unjuſt to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:109150:11"/>
me in this, as in other things, as well as Fallacious, in ſeeking to deceive
his Readers, by making them believe I was of the ſame Mind with
them, in all their Notions and Doctrines of the <hi>Light Within.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In my Book of <hi>Retractations,</hi> what Unwary, or Unfound Paſſages I
have found in any of my former Books, I have very freely and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Retracted; and I thank God, who has given me a Heart ſo to do;
and I pray God, that he may be pleas'd to work the like willingneſs in
the Hearts of all my Adverſaries, to Confeſs and Retract their Errors,
as I have done mine: But what of Truth I have writ in any of my
former Books, either concerning the <hi>Light Within,</hi> or any other Subject,
I Retain, and I hope ſhall continue ſo to do, to my dying moment.</p>
            <p>And beſides my particular Retractation of particular Paſſages, I have,
in my ſaid Book, made a general Retractation <hi>of all that is not according
to the Doctrine of the Holy Scripture;</hi> to which I now add; <hi>And of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the 39 Articles of the Church of England, all which I do Believe to
be perfectly agreeable to the Holy Scriptures:</hi> Which I hope will ſatisfie
the Moderate and Impartial; but for others, it is in vain for me to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to ſatisfie them, who will not be ſatisfied. And notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Clamour of my Adverſaries againſt me, of my Unconſtancy,
and Inconſiſtency in Principles, would they but give me a fair meeting,
before Impartial Witneſſes, I could ſhew much more their Unconſtancy
and Inconſiſtency, ten fold, than what they can ſhew of mine.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing that <hi>B. Cool</hi> blames me for, both in his Preface and
Book, is, for Quoting a Paſſage in my <hi>Synopſis,</hi> out of <hi>W. Pen</hi>'s <hi>Serious
Apology,</hi> p. 146. <hi>But that He,</hi> [viz. <hi>That Outward Perſon that Suffered at</hi>
Jeruſalem] <hi>was properly the Son of God, we utterly deny.</hi> This <hi>B. Cool</hi> calls a
Juggle; <hi>See</hi> (ſaith <hi>B.C.) the Jugling of this Man!</hi> But upon due Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Juggle will be found not to be mine, but his; and that baſe and
ſordid. But thus it is, Their Credit of Infallibility is ſo great a matter
with <hi>them,</hi> like the great <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that they will commit
the greateſt and moſt ſordid Equivocation, tho' ever ſo obvious and
apparent, rather than own their Error, as is evident in the preſent
Caſe. But where is the Juggle? Have I Quoted him wrong? He doth
not pretend that I have; for he grants they are <hi>W. Pen</hi>'s words. But
let us ſee whether his Gloſs on <hi>W. Pen</hi>'s words will excuſe him; he ſaith,
<hi>By the outward Perſon, he meant no more than Fleſh, Blood, and Bones, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
not only from the Godhead that dwelt in him, but alſo from the very
Soul of Chriſt, as he was Man:</hi> But that this Gloſs is a Juggle, will appear
from what follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Queſtion betwixt <hi>W. Pen</hi> and his Opponent, who was a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:109150:12"/>
               <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſter in <hi>Ireland,</hi> was not whether <hi>Fleſh, Blood, and Bones,
abſtract from the Godhead and the Soul of Chriſt, was that outward Perſon
that ſuffered at</hi> Jeruſalem; <hi>for it was not a Dead and Lifeleſs Body that
ſuffered, but a Living Body, and ſuch a Living Body, that was Animated
with a Rational Soul, the Nobleſt that ever was; and, together with the Soul,
was Perſonally united to the Godhead.</hi> And the like Juggle <hi>W. Pen</hi> himſelf
is guilty of, as <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> quotes him, in his <hi>Truths Defence,</hi> p. 72.
Thus Defending his Aſſertion, <hi>That he meant, the Body which ſuffered was
not properly the entire Son of God;</hi> But none of his Opponents ever ſo ſaid,
nor do I know that ever any Man did ſo Aſſert; and that being no
part of the Controverſy, cannot be the true meaning of <hi>W. Pen</hi>'s aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The outward Perſon doth as neceſſarily import, and ſignify
both the Soul and Godhead of Chriſt jointly with the Body, as <hi>B. Cool,</hi>
who is an outward Perſon, imports and ſignifieth both Soul and Body
of <hi>B. Cool.</hi> And if <hi>B. Cool</hi> ſhould borrow, or owe Money, can it be
ſaid, That it was only <hi>B. Cool</hi>'s Fleſh, Blood, and Bones, abſtractly
from his Soul, that owes that Money, and ſhould pay the Debt? Our
bleſſed Lord, who was that outward Perſon, that ſuffered for us, and
paid the debt of our Sins when he Died for us, was not Fleſh, Blood,
and Bones, without his Soul, nor without his Godhead: Therefore to
make ſuch an Abſtraction, is a meer Juggle. And by the like Evaſion,
if I ſhould ſay, That outward Perſon <hi>B. Cool,</hi> is not a Man, but a Beaſt;
doth he think that it would excuſe me, to ſay, I meant <hi>B. Cool</hi> abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
conſider'd from his Rational Soul, having only a Senſitive Soul in
him, common to him with the Beaſts? And he may as well ſay, a
piece of Wood, abſtract from its Length, or Breadth, or Depth, is not
a Body: Whereas ſuch an Abſtraction is a Contradiction; for we can
conceive no Body without its true Dimenſions, no more can we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a Perſon without the Parts whereof that perſon conſiſts. But
let <hi>B. Cool</hi> tell us, <hi>That outward Perſon that Suffered, whoſe Son was he
properly? If he was not properly the Son of God,</hi> Mary <hi>was not a Virgin.</hi>
To ſay he was the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> as one of <hi>B. Cool</hi>'s Brethren lately an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
at <hi>Turners-Hall,</hi> was no proper Anſwer to the Queſtion, but an
Evaſion; the Queſtion being, not who was his Mother, but who was
his Father: And as impertinent to the Queſtion was it to Anſwer,
<hi>That he was the Son of</hi> David <hi>and</hi> Abraham; for they were but his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
&amp; mediate Fathers: But I ask <hi>B. Cool, Who was his Immediate Father
as he was Man?</hi> If God, then as Man, that very outward Perſon was
the Son of God, as really and properly, and more really and properly,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:109150:12"/>
as that Outward Perſon, called <hi>B. Cool,</hi> was his Fathers Son: Yet not
ſo, that either our Saviours Soul, or Body was any part of the Godhead,
but becauſe his Soul and Body, was Perſonally United to the Eternal
Word, Eternally and before all Ages and Creatures, begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and that as Man, he was miraculouſly Conceived by the Power of
the Holy Ghoſt, and Born of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That <hi>W. Penn's</hi> Vile Error and Hereſie, and <hi>B. Cools</hi> Juggle,
may yet more appear, it is Evident from <hi>W. Penn's</hi> Words in his other
Books, that he thinks that outward Perſon that Suffered at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
was no part of the true Chriſt, <hi>But that</hi> (as he hath affirm'd) <hi>he was called
Chriſt, by a Metonymie of the thing containing, getting the Name of the
thing contained;</hi> as a Veſſel that holds Wine, is called Wine, yet this Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
is no part of the Wine, <hi>and that the</hi> Body <hi>of Chriſt, is called the Chriſt,</hi>
(he ſaith) that is Metonymically ſpoken, the thing containing, for the
thing contained; ſee <hi>W. Penns</hi> Rejoynder to <hi>Jo. Faldo, p.</hi> 304. Had he
ſaid, it was a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> of the part put for the whole, he had ſpoke as
a Chriſtian, but a Metonimy makes the Body (nor yet the Soul) not to
be any part of the true Chriſt. And in his <hi>p.</hi> 300, he ſaith, <hi>Chriſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
that Body for his Service, but that Body did not Conſtitute Chriſt, he is
Inviſible, and ever was ſo to the Vngodly World, (that was not his Body</hi>). By
all which it Evidently appears, <hi>W. Penn</hi> did not allow that Viſible Body
to be any part of him, for a part though it conſtitutes not the whole
altogether, yet in part, it Conſtitutes the whole, as well as <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s
Body Conſtitutes him in part. That the World did not <hi>See Chriſt,</hi> with
their Spiritual Eyes is granted, as neither do they ſee his faithful fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers;
but that they did ſee him really, and as properly, as ever <hi>B.
Cool</hi> ſaw <hi>W. Penn</hi> with Bodily Eyes, is clear from <hi>John</hi> 6. 36 where <hi>Jeſus</hi>
ſaid to the Unbelieving <hi>Jews, Yee alſo have ſeen me, and believed not.</hi>
But <hi>W. Penn,</hi> and <hi>B. Cool,</hi> will be Wiſer by that Spirit that is in them,
then the holy Spirit that did dictate the holy Scriptures, who calleth
him that was Born of the Virgin, <hi>the Son of God,</hi> the Chriſt, both <hi>God</hi>
and <hi>Man,</hi> by <hi>Perſonal Vnion,</hi> and the Holy Scriptures teacheth us no ſuch
diſtinction, as that the outward Perſon, was not properly <hi>the Son of
God,</hi> but he who dwells in that outward Perſon; for tho' Chriſt hath two
Natures, yet he has but one Perſon; it is great Arrogance and Impudence
in this <hi>B. Cool,</hi> who is known to be an Ignorant Man, in the knowledge of
the ſtrict, and proper Signification of Words, to pretend he knoweth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
what the Word Perſon ſignifieth, than all the Learned Men, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Chriſtendom, and then all the Holy Ancients, who ever held that our
Bleſſed Lord, even conſidered as a Perſon without us, becauſe of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:109150:13"/>
Union of the two Natures, was properly <hi>the Son of God,</hi> &amp; both <hi>God</hi>
and <hi>Man,</hi> as the Scriptures call him, which <hi>B. Cool,</hi> with his Arrogant
Ignorance, would teach to Speak more properly; and, as if he were both
Wiſer than the Holy Men that Pen'd the Scriptures, that never uſed any
ſuch diſtinction <hi>of Chriſt within, that outward Perſon being properly the Son of
God, but that, that outward Perſon in whom the Son Dwelt, was improperly the
Son of God;</hi> and alſo, as if Wiſer than all the Holy Ancients, and all
the Learned Men now in Chriſtendom, very Magiſterially, tells us, in his
p. 12. <hi>Nevertheleſs</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Since many People underſtand not the terms
of Proper and Improper, and are apt to Judge of things, according to their
Carnal Conceptions; for that reaſon, I ſhould have been glad the Expreſſion
had never been uſed.</hi> Thus we ſee how hard they ſtill ſtruggle for their
Infallibility; had W. <hi>Penn</hi> uttered that ſaying, from the Holy Ghoſt,
as <hi>G. Fox</hi> ſaith, in his <hi>Truth Defended, p. 104. Our giving forth Papers,
or Printed Books, it is, from the Immediate Eternal Spirit of God;</hi> and in his
<hi>Great Myſt. p. 98. And thoſe, and you, all that Speak and Write, and not from
God Immediately and Infallibly, you are all under the Curſe;</hi> why ſhould
<hi>B. Cool,</hi> have been glad that Expreſſion had never been uſed? Should
he not be glad of all the Words that come from the Holy Spirit? For
doubtleſs, all ſuch are very profitable, and if <hi>B. Cool,</hi> did not think theſe
Words came from the Holy Spirit, by <hi>G. Fox's</hi> Verdict, both W. <hi>Penn,</hi>
and <hi>B. Cool,</hi> for all his Lyes, and Fallacies uttered in this his Book,
are under the Curſe: But W. <hi>Penn,</hi> is not alone in this Vile Hereſie,
that Chriſts Body is no part of the true Chriſt, for <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> is as
deep in the Mire as W. <hi>Pen,</hi> who in his <hi>Chriſtian Quaker, p.</hi> 139. 140.
telleth us very deliberately, and as he ſeem'd to himſelf, very Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtically;
<hi>I diſtinguiſh</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>between Conſiſting and Having; Chriſt Had
Fleſh and Bones, but he did not Conſiſt of them.</hi> This ſhews the very heart
of their Hereſie; as a Man hath a Garment, but he doth not Conſiſt of
it, it is no part of him.</p>
            <p>Now to give my Readers an Inſtance, that <hi>B. Cool</hi> thinks himſelf
and his <hi>Brethren</hi> Wiſer than the Holy Ancients, in his and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
<hi>Chriſt, as he was Man, or that outward Perſon, to be Properly the Son
of God:</hi> I will briefly give ſome Account, who were the Patrons of W.
<hi>Penn, G. Whitehead,</hi> and <hi>B. Cool,</hi> or at leaſt their Forerunners in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
their Vile Hereſie: In the time of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Elder, certain
Hereticks called <hi>Bonoſiani,</hi> from their Maſter <hi>Bonoſus,</hi> denyed that <hi>Chriſt</hi>
as <hi>Man,</hi> was the <hi>Proper Son of God,</hi> and affirm'd that he was his <hi>Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Son;</hi> but were refuted by <hi>Juſtinian</hi> a Biſhop of the <hi>Valenſian Church;</hi>
who lived about that time: After them about the year 783, <hi>Elipandus,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:109150:13"/>
and <hi>Foelix,</hi> two <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhops, did openly affirm, and Preach, <hi>That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
Chriſt was the true proper and Natural Son of God, according to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature, yet according to his Humane Nature</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi> his Manhood Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
conſiſting of Soul and Body] <hi>he was only the Son of God by Adoption,</hi>
and by Grace, but not truly and properly [Behold your Anceſtors W.
<hi>Pen, B. Cool,</hi> and G. <hi>Whitehead</hi>] againſt whom, <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, called
<hi>a Synod,</hi> at <hi>Franckford,</hi> conſiſting of three Hundred Biſhops, about the
year 794, where that Hereſie was condemned; as <hi>J. Forbeſius</hi> in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
Hiſt. Theol. Lib. 6. Chap. 1. N. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Gives a full and
plain Account, and theſe Hereticks, as the ſaid Author gives an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
did make their great Argument againſt the Fleſh of Chriſt [to
wit, his Body of viſible Fleſh, which the Quakers will not have to be
any part of him, but a certain inviſible Body] for thus they did Argue,
<hi>The Fleſh, or Humanity of Chriſt, was not Begotten of the Subſtance of God,
therefore the Man Chriſt is not, in his Nature, the true and proper Son of
God; the which Argument,</hi> Paulus <hi>the</hi> Aquilenſian <hi>Biſhop</hi> anſwereth, and
retorteth his Argument againſt <hi>Foelix</hi> himſelf, <hi>That the Soul of Foelix was
not begotten of his Fathers Seed, and yet the whole Foelix was the true and
proper Son of his Father.</hi> And the like Retortion may be made againſt
thoſe Quakers, unleſs they will ſay, that the Men whom the World cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
their Fathers, were not their Fathers, becauſe they did not beget
their Souls, but only their Fleſh; yet this <hi>B. Cool</hi> thinks himſelf Wiſer
than theſe three Hundred famous Biſhops, who condemned this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
Hereſie above eight Hundred years ago.</p>
            <p>The Third thing whereof <hi>B. Cool</hi> Accuſeth me, both in his Preface
and Book, as wronging W. <hi>Pen,</hi> and the Quakers, is, That I have char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him, and them, <hi>that the Hiſtory of Chriſts incarnation was not neceſſary
to our Salvation,</hi> or as he explains it himſelf, p. 5. of his Preface, <hi>That
Faith in Chriſt, as he Dyed for us, was unneceſſary</hi> viz. <hi>To our Salvation,</hi> which
he ſaith, is ſo very Fallacious and Wicked, that it deſerveth no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.
But wherein doth he diſcover it to be ſo? I find not that he
bringeth one ſingle Inſtance, in all his Books, effectually proving that
W. <hi>Pen</hi> doth hold, that Faith in Chriſt as he Died for us, is neceſſary to
our Salvation; and indeed it is contrary, to the general Drift of all his
Books, and eſpecially his whole Diſconrſe of the General Rule of Faith
and Life, which he will have to be both one and the ſame, to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
Heathens and Chriſtians; and this as Perfect, full and Compleat
a Rule to the Heathens, who never heard of Chriſt, as to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and conſequently of the ſame extent, and reveals nothing more to
the Chriſtians, then to the Heathens, otherwiſe it would be leſs perfect,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:109150:14"/>
or more imperfect, to the Heathens than to the Chriſtians; but he will
not allow of any imperfect Rule to be the General Rule, becauſe of their
imperfection; he argues againſt the Scriptures being the
Rule,<note n="*" place="margin">Diſcourſe of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rule <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 24 ſecond Edition.</note> becauſe the Scriptures were given forth, not all at
once, but one part after another, therefore they are not to be
the Rule; and he makes it abſurd <hi>that one Age or part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
ſhould have a more perfect Rule of Faith and Practice than
another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I find only one Place which <hi>B. Cool</hi> doth bring, wherein he deals very
Fallaciouſly to prove that W. <hi>Penn</hi> holds Faith in Chriſt, as he Dyed,
to be neceſſary to our Salvation; as in his <hi>p.</hi> 13. and 14. where he quotes
W. <hi>Penn,</hi> ſaying, <hi>The outward Hiſtory of Chriſts exceeding Love to
Mankind, deſerves all Humble and Reverend Credit, as a Godly Tradition,
and it ſhould for ever Bind Men to Remember, Fear, and Worſhip him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note, Reader,</hi> here is yet not one Word of neceſſity of Faith in Chriſt,
as he is Man, as well as God, as the Object of our Faith; but let us
hear him further: <hi>But a firm belief in him,</hi> viz. <hi>Chriſt that ſo Appeared,
Lived, Dyed, Roſe and Aſcended, both as Teſtified of in the Scriptures of Truth,
and more eſpecially, as he breaks in upon the Soul, in his Divine Diſcoveries,
as the true Light Lightning every ev'ry one coming into the World.</hi> This
I call true Chriſtianity, ſaith W. <hi>Pen,</hi> tho' this hath a ſeeming Show,
as if W. <hi>Pen,</hi> meant that Faith in Chriſt, as he was that outward Perſon
that ſuffered at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was neceſſary; yet it is a meer Fallacy, for firſt,
that outward Perſon that ſuffered, was not properly the Son of God, as
W. <hi>Pen</hi> hath affirmed, and therefore no proper Saviour, nor Object of
Faith. 2dly W. <hi>Pen</hi> For about 16 Pages in his Rejoynder, argueth againſt
<hi>Jo. Faldo,</hi> that he who ſuffered was not properly the Chriſt, but by a
<hi>Metonimy</hi> he was ſo called; ſo that it was not the <hi>Outward Perſon,</hi> but he
that appeared in <hi>that outward Perſon,</hi> viz. <hi>The Light Within that outward
Perſon,</hi> that is the ſame Light in W. <hi>Pen</hi> and in all Men, that is the Saviour
or object of Faith, properly; he, or that outward Perſon that Dyed, was
not properly, but by a Metonimy, called the Saviour, or Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not properly the object of Faith; which yet will more fully appear,
by the paſſages I have quoted out of his other Books; in his <hi>Quakers a new
Nick-Name,</hi> he grants that Quakeriſm was introduced not by Preaching
the Promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and by pointing at his Humane Perſon; but by
Preaching a <hi>Light Within;</hi> and that ſeeing Chriſt is not to come again in
the Fleſh, the Quakers need not Preach what is not to be again; and if not
needful to be Preached, it Evidently follows, not needful to be believed.
His Excuſe that they deny not Chriſt's coming in the Fleſh, will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:109150:14"/>
him, for that's not the queſtion here, but whether Faith in him be
neceſſary to their Salvation? which <hi>W. Penn</hi> oppoſeth. And though in
his rejoinder to <hi>John Faldo,</hi> he grants that the Man <hi>W. Pen</hi>'s rejoinder
Chriſt Jeſus, Dyed, in <hi>Familiar uſage of Speech,</hi> and <hi>page</hi> 305, 306.
<hi>common Phraſe,</hi> by the Metonymie of the thing containing, getting the
Name of the thing contained; yet he affirms, that, <hi>in a more Myſtical
Senſe, the Jews who put Chriſt's Body only to Death, may be alſo ſaid, in that
very Action to have Murdered the Prince of Life and Glory.</hi> 1. Cor. 2. Now
what this <hi>Myſtical Senſe</hi> of their killing Chriſt is, doth appear out of
his own and his Brethrens Books, to wit, their <hi>killing the Light within,</hi> the
<hi>Seed of the Promiſe,</hi> this he will have to be a Myſtical Death, and this to
be the greater Myſtery, <hi>Chriſt Form'd within,</hi> the <hi>work of Regeneration,</hi> than
God manifeſt in the Fleſh, as he ſaith expreſly in his Preface to <hi>Ro. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay</hi>'s
Works; and this inward Death of Chriſt, he will have to be the
more proper, becauſe the inward Principle, called by him
and his Brethren,<note n="*" place="margin">Chriſt. Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, p. 97, 98.</note> 
               <hi>The Seed of the Woman,</hi> that is ſlain in
the Wicked, is properly the Chriſt, and that Seed is God
over all, as he ſaith in his <hi>Chriſtian Quaker;</hi> the abſurdity whereof, I
have ſhewed in my 4th Narative, <hi>p.</hi> 55, 56. and is ſo obvious, that the
very hearing of it, is enough to make Chriſtian Ears to Tingle; and
this Myſtical Senſe of Chriſt's Death, to wit, the Crucifying Chriſt
within Men, affirmed by <hi>W. Penn,</hi> is a key to us to underſtand the juggle
both of W. <hi>Penn</hi> and <hi>B. Cool,</hi> when he quotes W. <hi>Penn,</hi> that a firm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
in Chriſt, that ſo Appeared, Lived, Dyed, [to wit, in his Myſtical Senſe
of Death, that is the only proper Death of Chriſt, as if Chriſt as God,
whom he calls, <hi>The Seed of the Woman,</hi> and an Holy and Spiritual Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Light, Life, and Power, could be more properly Killed than
as he was Man: Oh Abominable! Roſe and Aſcended,] is neceſſary to
our Salvation.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Note, Reader,</hi> that in the very ſame page of <hi>B. Cool</hi>'s Book <hi>p.</hi>
14. where he brings this juggling Teſtimony of <hi>W. Penn</hi> to Confirm
the juggle, and make it appear, he quotes him further, ſaying, <hi>And he
that obeyes this</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> This <hi>W. Penn</hi> and <hi>B. Cool,</hi> thinks Men may do, and yet have no Faith in Chriſt, come in the Fleſh without them, ſuch as the Heathens among the <hi>Indians,</hi> and <hi>Brachmans,</hi> whom they ownto be their Chriſtian Brethren, ſo that Moral Heathen, and Chriſtian, are but two Names to one Thing.</note> 
               <hi>Light, is a Child of
Light, a Child of God, a true Chriſtian.</hi>
So this is that, which changeth Man,
and Regenerates him, and of a Child
of Wrath, makes a Child of Grace,
and an Heir of the Promiſe, ſaith
<hi>W. Penn,</hi> which, ſaith <hi>B. Cool,</hi> is a bare
Hiſtorical Faith of Chriſt's Life,
Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will never do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:109150:15"/>
But whoever ſaid, of all <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s or <hi>B. Cool</hi>'s Opponents, that a bare
Hiſtorical Faith would do? not one; therefore this is another Juggle
and Fallacie of <hi>B. Cool,</hi> when he excuſeth <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s ſaying, <hi>Faith in
the Hiſtory of Chriſt's outward Manifeſtation, is a deadly Poiſon, theſe
Latter Ages has been Infected with, p.</hi> 12. as if <hi>W. Penn,</hi> meant it only,
that a bare Hiſtorical Faith, without the inward work of Sanctification,
were ſuch; which was never the queſtion, nor matter of Controverſie
between <hi>W. Penn</hi> and <hi>John Faldo,</hi> againſt whom he there Diſputes, or
any other of his Opponents, who never ſaid that a bare Hiſtorical Faith
would or could Save any; yet ſtill their Phraſe is unſound and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
<hi>That Faith in the Hiſtory of Chriſt's outward Manifeſtation is a deadly
Poyſon;</hi> for the bare Conviction, of the Truth of the Hiſtory, and aſſent
to it, which is that Hiſtorical Faith he profeſſeth to mean, where no
real Sanctification is wrought, is ſo far from being <hi>a deadly Poyſon,</hi> that
it hath a real Service, remotely at leaſt, to prepare the Soul for Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
and if many ſo Convinced, are not Sanctified, as <hi>B. Cool</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
in his 16 <hi>p. That Faith will be an Aggravation of their Guilt and
Miſery, which is therefore no deadly Poyſon, but of great Vſe,</hi> even as Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified
Men's having a Conviction of the Light within, and ſome
Senſe of it, and that is more than a bare Hiſtorical Faith of it, will be an
Aggravation of their Guilt; but will <hi>B. Cool</hi> allow Men therefore to call
it, a <hi>deadly Poyſon,</hi> that infects Hundreds of the Quakers ſo called, who are
no more Sanctified than many others, who have but the Hiſtorical Faith
of Chriſt without; and if all <hi>England,</hi> and all Chriſtendom beſide, had
but a bare Hiſtorical Faith of the Light within, without the inward work
of Sanctification, that Faith would not Save them; yet it followeth not,
according to <hi>B. C.</hi> that the Light within, or a Hiſtorical Faith in
it, is a <hi>deadly Poyſon.</hi> I cannot but think <hi>B. Cool</hi> would think it a great
Bleſſing to all Chriſtendome, and a great Introduction to the Quakers
Religion, if they all had a real Conviction, or Hiſtorical Faith of
the Quakers Notion of the Light within, though all were not Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by it; yet that that Conviction or Faith, is a <hi>deadly Poyſon,</hi> I ſee
not how he can Grant: The Quakers, commonly diſtinguiſh betwixt
Conviction and Converſion; they call that Conviction, or Convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when a Man aſſents to their Great and Foundamental Principle,
the <hi>Light within,</hi> which they reckon a Step or Introduction to Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and if Converſion do not follow, yet the Conviction is good; as
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of the Law, tho' many did not obey it, it was good. And what
<hi>B. Cool,</hi> would ſay in the Caſe of a general Convincement of the Light
within, according to his and his Brethrens Notion of it: I would ſay
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:109150:15"/>
much more of a general Convincement all over the World, and all
Heathen Nations; that the Hiſtory of Chriſt's Birth, Life, Miracles,
Death, Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is true, that it would be ſo
far from being a <hi>deadly Poyſon,</hi> that it would be a great good, and a
great Advantage and Introduction to ſpread the Chriſtian Religion,
over the Heathen Nations. All Chriſtendome, and in a ſort all the
World, hath a real Notion and Faith of the Light within, as it is an
Aſſent of their Conſciences, to the work of the Law, Writ in their
Hearts; and this Faith or Aſſent, is certainly a good thing, and of great
Concern to the good of Mankind, being the Foundation of all the good
Laws and Governments that are to be found in Heathen Nations, tho'
thouſands who have it, yet are not Sanctified by it, nor can they be
Sanctified by it, without Faith in Chriſt Crucified, and without a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
ſuperadded Illumination, and Operation of the Holy Spirit, that
doth uſually Accompany the Written Word, according to Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
way of working, and the methods of Divine Providence towards
the Race of Mankind.</p>
            <p>But the Quakers general Notion of the <hi>Light Within being ſufficient to
Salvation without any elſe,</hi> and confirmed ſo to be by <hi>G. Whitehad</hi> in his
late <hi>Antidote</hi> p. 28. and by <hi>W. Penn</hi> in his <hi>Diſcourſe of the General Rule
of Faith and Practice,</hi> juſtified all along by <hi>B. Cool,</hi> and his own ſaying,
as above noted, <hi>That there is but one General Rule of Faith and Practice,</hi> to
all Mankind, is ſuch a plain Proof of his Deiſm, in oppoſition to the
Chriſtian Faith, that greater cannot be given; notwithſtanding of what
he talks in contradiction and Inconſiſtency to himſelf; and <hi>W. Penn</hi> and
his other Brethren, p. 27. <hi>That God in his Mercy and Goodneſs, hath
ſuper-added the Holy Scriptures for a Rule to us to walk by, and according to.
Yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we are not therefore to neglect the inward Law and Rule and
Eternal Precepts in our Hearts, becauſe we have an outward one to walk by.</hi>
Thus he ſtill leaves the true State of the Controverſy, on purpoſe to
divert and deceive his Weak Reader, by his juggling. None ſaith
that we ought to neglect the inward Law or Light in the Conſcience,
of all Mankind; becauſe we have the outward Rule of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
for true Chriſtians highly Eſteeem of both, and Labour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their Lives to both; but as to all the peculiar Doctrines and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> as diſtinct from <hi>Deiſm</hi> or <hi>Gentile</hi> Religion, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
refined they hold the <hi>Rule</hi> of the Chriſtian Faith and Religion, with
reſpect to its peculiar Doctrines and Precepts, to be ſuch a <hi>Rule</hi> as the
Heathens have not, and it may be acknowledged to be a <hi>Superadded
Rule,</hi> as much as Chriſtian Religion is a ſuperadded Religion, to any
thing that was or is True in <hi>Gentile Religion.</hi> But for <hi>B. Cool,</hi> and his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:109150:16"/>
Brethren, who own but one <hi>general Rule and Practice, to all Mankind:
And ſay the Light within every Man is ſufficient to Salvation, without any thing
elſe.</hi> [Let him deny this if he dares] to talk of a ſuperadded Rule, is a
Contradiction and Inconſiſtence: for if they allow a <hi>Rule</hi> ſuperadded to
the common Illumination, obliging Chriſtians to believe and practice
any more things than what the Heathens are obliged to, they make two
<hi>Rules;</hi> one common to Chriſtian and Heathens, <hi>viz. The Light Within;</hi> the
other peculiar to the Chriſtian, which is of a far greater Perfection, and
hath a far greater Number of things both to be believed and practiſed,
and of a higher Nature, many or moſt of them, than what the common
Illumination in the Conſciences of Mankind generally Teacheth.</p>
            <p>And as Concerning what <hi>B. Cool</hi> Grants of <hi>Gods Superadding the Holy
Scriptures, for a Rule to us to walk by.</hi> I ask him, Was that Superadded
Rule, abſolutely neceſſary to be added to our Chriſtianity, through our
Faith and Obedience to it? If he ſay it was and is, then he contradicts
their <hi>Fundamental</hi> Notion <hi>of the ſufficiency of the</hi> Light Within <hi>all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
to Salvation, and all Mens having but one general Rule,</hi> his own Words.
If it be not abſolutely neceſſary, what need of it's being ſuperadded,
ſeeing the common illumination hath a ſufficiency in it abundantly
(according to the Quakers) not only to inform the Underſtanding of
all things neceſſary to Salvation, without any ſuper-added Rule, but of
Grace to enable all Mankind perfectly to obey all Gods Commands;
and to attain to a Sinleſs Perfection, and that in a much nearer way, and
with fewer means, as having fewer and eaſier Precepts; for who can
deny but the Laws and dictates of the Common Illuminations given to all
Mankind are much fewer, and eaſier to be obey'd, than what the Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian
Religion Superadds; for it cannot be proved that the Common Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
without the ſuperadded Law of Chriſtianity, forbids <hi>Poligamy;</hi>
but the Law of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> forbids it: And many other things the
<hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> both Commands and Forbids, which the common Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
doth neither command nor forbid, tho in the Subſtance of the
Ten Commandments, commonly called the Moral Law, both the Rules
agree. Again, this <hi>Super added Law</hi> of the Holy Scriptures, <hi>B. Cool</hi> will not
allow it to be any other than <hi>Secondary,</hi> compared with the common
illumination, as the <hi>Copy</hi> is to the <hi>Original</hi> which is the <hi>Primary,</hi> and as the
Copy has nothing but what the original hath, and is better and more
<hi>Authentick</hi> in the <hi>Original,</hi> than in the <hi>Copy;</hi> and the <hi>Original</hi> has no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
on the <hi>Copy,</hi> but the <hi>Copy</hi> has on the <hi>Original;</hi> from all which
it is very plain, whatever the Scriptures Teach or Dictate, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Illumination in the Conſcience doth not firſt and originally dictate,
is of no further Obligation, upon any Men; for the <hi>Secondary</hi> binds only
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:109150:16"/>
by the force and Authority of the <hi>Primary,</hi> and hath all its certainly
and Evidence therefrom, as <hi>W. Penn</hi> doth argue in his <hi>Diſcourſe of the
general Rule of Faith and Practice;</hi> where he preferrs the inward Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
common to all Mankind, to the Scriptures; affirming the firſt to
be the Rule for it's Perfection, certainty, Evidence, Plainneſs, Antiquity,
Univerſality, and many other Reaſons, and for all which Reaſons he
Rejects the Scriptures from being the <hi>Primary</hi> Rule; yet is ſo kind to
allow them to be the <hi>Secondary</hi> in diverſe things, <hi>viz.</hi> So far as the
common Illumination is Commenſurate to the Scriptures, which is only
but in a ſmall part; and for the reſt of them, the common illumination
hath nothing about them, as whether True or Falſe, further than the
Ten Precepts of the Decalogue.</p>
            <p>But that <hi>W. Pen,</hi> and <hi>B. Cool</hi> alſo confeſſeth, that the Quakers have
no Extraordinary Revelation, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) Special and Peculiar, Concerning
Chriſts Incarnation, Birth, Death, Reſurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See <hi>B. Cool,</hi> his
page 20. <hi>B. Cool</hi> and <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s Citation of <hi>Calvin,</hi> is a meer Juggle
of both, and a notorious perverſion of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Words, as I have
ſhown in my Book called, <hi>W. Pen</hi>'s Deiſm; for that <hi>Calvin</hi> aſſerteth the
neceſſity of the inward Motion or Influence of the holy Spirit, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
us that the Scriptures are true, is no Argument that <hi>Calvin</hi>
thought the Spirit, or Light Within, to be the Rule, as I have
ſhewed in that Book of <hi>Deiſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the quotations of <hi>W. Pen</hi>'s ſaying, in his <hi>Addreſs to Proteſtants, What
is Chriſt but Meekneſs, Juſtice, and Mercy, Patience, Charity and Virtue, in
Perfection? He objects,</hi> p. 32. <hi>That I purpoſely left out the laſt Word,</hi> viz. <hi>In
Perfection,</hi> and for this uncharitable ſuppoſition, he charges me to be a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſter,
&amp; guilty of Envy and Malice, as if <hi>I</hi> did repreſent <hi>W. Pen,</hi> to have
dwindled away Chriſt to nothing but a Habit. But <hi>I</hi> anſwer, <hi>I</hi> did not
omit purpoſely the word <hi>in Perfection,</hi> as he doth uncharitably charge
me, for that half Sheet of mine, called the <hi>Synopſis</hi> of <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s <hi>Deiſme,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but an <hi>Index</hi> of my Book of <hi>Deiſme,</hi> and ſome other quotations I had
extracted out of <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s Printed Books; I had no need to put down
his words at large, for I put down all that was neceſſary to ſhow his
<hi>Deiſme,</hi> and the words <hi>in Perfection,</hi> I have put them in my 3d. Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,
for which ſee page 8. of my 3d. Narrative, which was printed
a year before my <hi>Synopſis.</hi> Nor doth the Word <hi>in Perfection,</hi> when
added, help <hi>W. Pen,</hi> or <hi>B. Cool,</hi> out of the Mire of <hi>Deiſme,</hi> for who can
doubt but the Habits of Vertue in perfect Men, who are come to a ſinleſs
Perfection, are perfect, as <hi>B. Cool</hi> and his Bretheren's Principle, obliges
them to believe? But ſuppoſing that by <hi>Meekneſs, Mercy, Juſtice, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Charity, in Perfection, W. Pen</hi> did mean not any Habits of Virtue,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:109150:17"/>
however perfect in Men, but the <hi>Eſſential Perfections of Chriſts Godhead,</hi>
which may be ſaid to be, <hi>Juſtice, Goodneſs, Mercy, Charity, in Infinite
Perfection,</hi> yet the Conſequence that <hi>W. Penn</hi> draws from this, as it is
weak, and falſe, to prove that a Meek or meer juſt Man is a Chriſtian,
ſo it is ſtrong enough to prove <hi>W. Pen</hi> a meer Deiſt; for though <hi>Chriſts
Godhead is Infinite Goodneſs, Juſtice, Charity,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> deſcribes <hi>God to
be Love; yet Chriſt is not only God, but Man alſo;</hi> and that Faith that deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates
a Man to be a true Chriſtian, muſt be a <hi>Faith in Chriſt, not as
God only, but as both God and Man.</hi> Which Faith muſt be a living Faith,
that hath good Works; but againſt this Faith <hi>W. Penn</hi> argues, as not
neceſſary to make a Man a true Chriſtian, and by a falſe Conſequence,
doth Inferr, that he who believes in God, believes in Chriſt, becauſe
Chriſt is God; as if Chriſt were God only, and not Man alſo.</p>
            <p>Thus Reader I have made good my three Charges againſt <hi>W. Penn</hi>
and <hi>B. Cool,</hi> [and the Truth of my <hi>Synopſis</hi>] which he calls the three Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of my whole Fabrick; and ſuppoſing it were ſo, ſeeing they are firm,
the Fabrick muſt be firm alſo.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not further enlarge in Anſwer to his Book at preſent, judging it needleſs, but
refer to my other Books, eſpecially my 4 Narratives, my book called the Deiſme of <hi>W.
Penn;</hi> which <hi>B. Cool</hi> ought to Anſwer throughout, if he thinks to clear <hi>W. Penn</hi> of Deiſme;
where his and his Brethrens Deiſme and Antichriſtian Principles are ſufficiently diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
and whereof the <hi>Synopſis</hi> was but as an <hi>Index</hi> And that other called the Fallacies
of <hi>W. Pen</hi> and his Brethren, in their Anſwer to the Biſhop of <hi>Cork.</hi>

            <p>As to the Airy Flouts and Scoffs, throughout his Book and Preface, more <hi>Iſhmael</hi>-like,
than a Sober Heathen, and ſome baſe Inſinuations againſt me, in p. 11. and 12. of his
Preface, being as Falſe as Fooliſh, I think not worth Noticing.</p>
            <p>But I dare him to make good his charge againſt me in any of theſe particulars, which
if he offers to do, I doubt not but I ſhall thereby the more diſcover his Falſhood and Folly.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Briſtol</hi> Quakers Reaſons why they met me not, to Anſwer to my Charges
againſt their Antichriſtian Principles, then Read and Proved againſt them, out of the
Books of their moſt approved Authors, at the Baptiſts Meeting-Houſe the 24th of <hi>July,</hi>
1699. They being in effect no other than what the Quakers of <hi>London</hi> gave, why they
refuſed to meet me at <hi>Turners-Hall</hi> the 11th of <hi>January</hi> 1699. I refer to the Poſtſcript
of my 4th Narrative, Printed 1700, where they are ſufficiently anſwered. But the
only effectual Reaſon, they both have omitted, which was, <hi>that of a Guilty Conſcience,</hi>
knowing in themſelves that they are really chargeable with thoſe things.</p>
            <p>But whereas they ſay, <hi>I was not aſhamed Hypocritically to profeſs my ſelf a Quaker, as I
had done ever ſince I came to the City,</hi> is a Notorious Untruth; When by Violence they kept
me out at their Meeting-Houſe-Door, ſome of them ask'd me, <hi>If I was a Quaker? I ſaid
I was a Friend of Truth,</hi> but did not ſay I was a Quaker. If to gain ſome of the Quakers
from their Heatheniſm and Antichriſtianity, (as God hath been pleaſed to make me In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental
to gain ſome,) I was for ſome time in ſome outward Behaviour like them,
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, to the <hi>Jews,</hi> he was as a <hi>Jew;</hi> and to the Gentiles, as a Gentile; this will
not prove me a Hypocrite; as it proveth not that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſuch.</p>
