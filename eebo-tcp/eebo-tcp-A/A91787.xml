            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Wherein it appears the accuſations of the Army are
unjuſt, and the Armies proceedings juſtified by
the Word of God, and by the light of
Nature and Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Alſo a diſcovery of that Learning, and Ordination
theſe Miniſters have, and the vanity and inſufficiencie
thereof, by the Word of God, and that thoſe are the things
with which they delude and deceive the people.</p>
            <q>They have ſeene vanity, and lying divination, ſaying, The Lord ſaith, and
the Lord hath not ſent them, and they have made others to hope that they
would confirme the word. My hand ſhall be on the Prophets that ſee
vanity, and divine lyes.
<bibl>Ezek. 13. 2. 3 4. 6.</bibl>
            </q>
            <q>The Lord fruſtrateth the tokens of lyars, and maketh diviners mad; turneth
wiſe men backward. and maketh their knowledge fooliſhnes,
<bibl>Eſa, 44. 25.</bibl>
            </q>
            <q>But God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe,
and God hath choſen the weak things of the world to confound the
things that are mighty,

they were very wroth, and conſpired all of
them together, to fight againſt</hi> Hieruſalem,
<hi>and to hinder it,</hi> Nehe. 4. 7, 8. See verſe 4. 5.
So doe theſe Miniſters, to obſtruct, and hinder the Army from ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
up the breaches others have made. <hi>There aroſe out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe
pit, ſmoak, and the ſmoake was as the ſmoake of a great
furnace; and the Sunne and the Ayre was darkned, by reaſon of

and to them was given power to do hurt.</hi> Revel. 9, 2, 3. &amp; 5. 8. This
ſmoake is the learning of the Miniſters, this is the <hi>wiſdome of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,

learning men grow up, and become Miniſters; this; ſmoke, this
learning, <hi>darkned the Sun;</hi> obſcure Chriſt he cannot be ſeene for

Mens mindes are darkened and clouded they cannot ſee, nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the knowledge of the light of the Sun, viz. of Chriſt; by reaſon of

forty ſeven appeare in Print in one Booke againſt the proceedings of

            <p>1 That you muſt not judge that to be truth, which the greateſt

theſe men, they are <hi>high-minded,</hi> they would have the Army to know
that they are but private perſons, and that themſelves are miniſters of
the Goſpell, and that their knowledgo and underſtanding, is above theirs;
For they have not the learning they have, and therefore if there be a
queſtion to be propounded, they muſt be ſent for to reſolve it; they may
not have ſo much liberty as to ſpeak what they underſtand, to their owne
queſtions that concerne them, becauſe they are private perſons; But
dare theſe Miniſters ſay, ſuch as are private perſons have not the Spirit
of God? Or will they deny the ſufficiency of the Spirit, teaching ſo much
as to anſwer to a queſtion. Oh the pride of theſe men! bluſh oh heavens
at their blaſphemy, for they attribute it to their learning. This ſavours
ſtrongly of the fleſh, Phil. 2, 3. and is contrary to the word of the Lord
which ſaith <hi>The Spirituall man diſcerneth all things, yea the deepe

ever will ſanctify it for ſuch an uſe; The Scripture prove the contrary.
Learning is a wiſe thing in the eyes of the world; therefore God rejects
it. <hi>God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world, to confound

            <p>Fourthly the learning of the ſpirit humbleth men, and cauſeth them <hi>to

Law ſaith, its no murther; I had ſinned, if I had not done it; for that Law
that requires me to preſerve my Neighbours life, bids me preſerve my

to periſh, will it not be my ſinne alſo? This is the cauſe of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
the King ſhould have help't, &amp;c. but did not, then it became
the duty of the Parliament to have releeved the Kingdome, but they
did not; her neceſſities great, and many Petitions concerning th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

when all failes, no ground of hope of life is left: danger eminent, and

the duty of the Army to help, and if they had not, it had been their
ſinne, if not their overthrow; if they had ſuffered it to periſh, the
Kingdome had been well holpen up with a remedy in extremity.</p>
            <p>If the Army had been as the <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Levit,</hi> that allowed no help to
the man; this the wounded and dying Kingdom, I would, if I could, have
done it my ſelfe alone, and not aske no leave; God requires me to
doe all the good I can to my ſelfe, and others, if I can doe good with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
man, I will not ask his leave; I need not, ſuppoſe I ſee one a robbing
of another, or hath taken his Cloake, &amp;c. from him, I will require him

give it the owner: If he, or any ſay, You are out of your Calling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
what, and who gave you commiſſion to meddle with me? So long as I
doe that which is juſt I paſſe not for ſuch words, it is my duty, as a
man, and as a Chriſtian, to releeve the oppreſſed, and doe what good I
can; if I were able I would quickly remove all the oppreſſions in this
Kingdom, and the next, and if I could the next to that, and I ſhould
ſinne if I did not doe it. Who gave <hi>Cromwell</hi> Commiſſion to doe ſo
much good as he did in <hi>Scotland?</hi> I doubt that the old <hi>Caviſe,</hi> and the

            </p>
            <p>8 The Army had a cleare call to doe what they did according to the
<hi>London</hi> Miniſters Principle, as appeares clearly from their owne confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;

&amp;c. but obſerve (upon what grounds they make it appeare, they have a
call from God to doe ſo) <hi>We apprehend our ſelves obliged thus to appear
for the maintenance of, and ſetling the Government of the Kingdom; to teſtifie
our utter diſlike and deteſtation, it is moſt apparent to us</hi> your <hi>way and

            </p>
            <p>This is in their Judgements and Conſcience a cleare call, ſo that if
the Army can ſay the ſame things, they have the ſame call they have; I
ſhould be heartily ſorry if they had no better call then the Miniſters,
whoſe Conſcience I appeale to, whether if they had power in their
hands to reforme all things, that (in their Conſciences) are amiſſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they doe not judge that they ought to doe it, and ſhould ſinne if
they did not doe it, though they are no Magiſtrates; if they ſay, ye, then
they juſtifie the Army (for they doe but according as they are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by God in his Word, and their owne Conſcience) if they ſay no,
if I did beleeve them, I am perſwaded their judgements would
change the very firſt day that the power comes in their hands.</p>
            <p>9 The Army had an expreſſe command of God to warrant their not
disbanding, and ceazing on the Members, and the ſixth Command in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes,
that they ſhould doe no murder; this generall command com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends

himſelfe and others, the blame muſt reſt on them that cauſed it; that is,
theſe Parliament Men, for had they done well they ſhould not have
been medled with, all meanes, with too much patience have been uſed
but nothing prevailes.</p>
            <p>10 All Actions agreeable to the Word is lawfull, but to put a ſtop
to prevent the ſhedding of innocent bloud is agreeable to the Word;
for its the way to prevent much bloud to ceaze on theſe Members,
therefore they were bound in conſcience to doe it.</p>

apparent neceſſity of danger, its but a fancie, an uncertaine fancie, a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
conceit, viſible to them and their Party, the Army is vanquiſhed by
this one poore dart of pretended neceſſity, the danger is greater this way then
in the Treaty.</hi> Are you more able to judge then the Army, and their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
Are you infallible, you preſume you know better then the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who hath declared, That what the Parliament men did, was
highly diſhonourable to the proceedings of Parliament, and apparent
deſtructive to the good of the Kingdome, and that their Votes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
to the Kingdome, and that ſome of them regarded not the
glory of God, and the good of the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Paliaments determinations are uncontrovleable by inferiors:</hi> if the
power of Judging, and reſtraining, is onely in the Repreſentatives, then
they may doe what they will, and deſtroy the Kingdome by authority,
you allow not the people in no cauſe whatſoever, not the leaſt privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
or liberty, to help themſelves: then to what purpoſe have wee
fought for the liberties and priviledge of the people, when it ſeemes
they are notto have any, if it be as you ſay, we are abſolute ſlaves without
any liberty; for liberty turned into neceſſity, is liberty no longer; your
principle is large and dangerous, when iniquitie runnes downe like a
mighty ſtreame, you ſay, let it runne, they are Rebels and Traytors that
offer to ſtop it; this principle will pleaſe Tyrants, that they may doe
what they will, none may call them to accompt, nor meddle with them,
if they act contrary to the end and intent of a Parliament, if they refuſe
to conſider the teares of the oppreſſed, and the cries of the poore, and
burne our Petitions inſtead of grantting them, increaſe our burdens and
oppreſſions, they may commit as much ſinne, and doe as much miſchief
as they pleaſe, and be ſheltred under ally, which you call the priviledge
of Parliament; but if it be not a ſinne in the people to ſuffer thoſe in
Authority to ſinne; why did God puniſh the people, for the ſinnes of
thoſe in authority, as appeares <hi>Jer. 15. 1, 2, 3, 4. 2 King. 21. 11. 12.
&amp;</hi> 24. 3. Your Doctrine is exceedingly contrary to Scripture, for if <hi>the
Saints may bind Kings in chaines, and their Nobles in fetters of Iron; to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
on them the Judgements written, this honour have all the Saints,</hi> Pſal.
149. 7, 8, 9. Then I hope they may put a ſtop to wicked Rulers. You

enough to ſinne, a <hi>breach of Privilegde,</hi> to remove and puniſh evill do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
is abomination to you; you ſhould have proved by Scripture,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115558:8"/>
that they are to have ſuch a priviledge: but what you ſay is but ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to what once one of the Biſhops Miniſters told me, that <hi>it was the
Magiſtrates ſinne, if he commanded that which was evill, but not ours in
obeying an unlawfull command; &amp; that if the Magiſtate commanded me to
kneele to a Crucifix, I might lawfully doe it, and we muſt be ſubiect to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
for conſcience ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is one of your Miniſters of the Goſpell, this Fig-leafe will not
hold, <hi>The woman gave me, therefore I did eat;</hi> The Parliament bid me,
therefore I did it; I was not to judge, I am under the <hi>command of my

<hi>he can tell better then I, I am not to judge, not to take it out of his hand.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
the Miniſters ſay it muſt be ſo, therefore I am content to ſuffer
with a good Conſcience; all power is Gods, and its all in the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate;
God requires me to doe good, but I muſt not doe it without
his conſent. <hi>God appointed Magiſtrates for our good, Rom.</hi> 13. 4. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he may ruine all: this is the ſumme of your Expoſition.</p>
            <p>The Word of God is to be his Rule in Commanding, and mine in
Obeying; we are both limited to the Rules of Scripture, Gods glory,
and the good of others, it muſt appeare unto us.</p>
            <p>If the people may not Judge, but the Magiſtrate, then the people
are inſlaved to their judgements, and we muſt act our owne Ruine if
they bid us, which is contrary to the Scripture: For the Children of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> ſinned, in that they obeyed unlawfull Commands: <hi>Epharim is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
and broken in Judgement, becauſe he willingly walked after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,</hi>
Hoſ. 5. 10, 11. <hi>For the Statute of</hi> Omri <hi>are kept, and all
the workes of the houſe of</hi> Ahab, <hi>and ye walk in their Councels, that I ſhould

of my people,</hi> Micha 6. 16. <hi>The wiſdome of the prudent is to underſtand
his way,</hi> Prov. 14. 8. Therefore the Army did well, to conſider what
they did, in obeying, or not obeying; elſe we ſhould equall the Parl.
with God, yea, and preferre them before him, in obeying them againſt
God. Every thing in the uſe of it, is either good, or evill; the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
thing when it comes to action is ſo, when the circumſtances of
it is good, the action is good; if any of the circumſtances of it are evill,
the action is evill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Is no act binding unleſſe it be ſufficiently cleared; is a tenent deſtructive
to all Government:</hi> how can we judge it our duty to doe that which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115558:9"/>
we know not; your doctrine tends ſtrongly to blind obedience, to doe
we know not what.</p>
            <p>All actions without <hi>Faith</hi> is ſinnefull: that which we know nor what
it is, cannot be done in <hi>Faith,</hi> I muſt be <hi>fully perſwaded of the lawfulneſſe

            <p>Bravely ſpoke, then they may for ever doe what they liſt, for if there

            <p>Danger of inconvenientie ſhould not cauſe perſons to bee Controulers of
Magiſtracy. <hi>What no inconveniency? If ſo, we muſt then quietly,
and contentedly ſuffer our ſelves to be deſtroyed.</hi> The pleae, of neceſſity, is
of the leſſe weight in your cauſe, becauſe (we feare) the ends you ayme at,
are no more juſtifiable then the meanes you uſe, the neceſſity pleaded is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meerely pretended, or at leaſt, contracted by your owne miſcariage:
<hi>who made you a Judge of evill thoughts; as for the neceſſitie and the
meanes they uſe, its juſtifiable by the word, this is above anſwered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Power of executing is committed to the Army,</hi> to execute the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable
Decree of Parliament, then the Miniſters ſhall Decree, the

            <p>
               <hi>If the Parliament had not done well, the Army ſhould not have upheld it
in dead waies, the Charge being true:</hi> but how could that be known,
ſeeing none but themſelves muſt judge: beſides, how is it lawfull for
them to leave them; ſeeing, as you ſay, they are <hi>ſworne ſervants,</hi> not
onely, for 7 years, but for ever: and they muſt obey them: therefore
if they had left them; the exceptions might have been the ſame: <hi>It had
been nobly done of the Army to have laid downe their Commiſſion:</hi> then
ſhould we have had our Government ſet up in full power.</p>
            <p>They that reſiſt Authority, the Power, reſiſt the Ordinance of God, ſhall
receive to themſelves damnation. The golden coard of Government broken
aſunder; the honour of Magiſtracy laid in the duſt; what threatnings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them that oppoſe Gods Ordinance, <hi>Jude</hi> 8. manifeſt oppoſite to law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Authoritie, God hath ſet over us, it was the Armies ſinne and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
in not disbanding at the Parliaments command.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:115558:9"/>
By theſe and the like Scriptures, ye wreſt and pervert the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
are we to obey Authority becauſe they command it, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the goodneſſe of that they command? if the firſt, (for
that is your charge or voting, the other we grant) why are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
reproved for obeying, <hi>Mica 6. 15. 16. Hoſ.</hi> 5. 11. If it be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
that the Authority command it, it was not their ſinn in obeying;
or if the Magiſtrate hath power over our bodies, then the 3. children
ſinned in not bowing to <hi>Nebuchadnezars</hi> Image, as he commanded:
by this rule we may ſin if the Authority command it, if we muſt
be ſubject to them, as not to oppoſe the will of thoſe in Authority
in no cauſe, then if they ſet the Kingdome on fire, and will have it
burnt, we muſt not offer to quench it but ſuffer it to be burnt into
aſhes, nor never queſtion them for it if they are not accountable.</p>
            <p>If the command muſt be lawfull, I demand who muſt judge of the
unlawfullneſſe of it: if ye ſay the Magiſtrate, then the cauſe is the
ſame with the former: if ye ſay, he that is to obey it, is to judge of
the lawfullneſſe of that he is to do, it is fit he ſhould, why then do
ye cry out of ſin for not doing that they do not ſee to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
neither is it ſufficient that the thing commanded be in the
nature of it lawfull, for one circumſtance may make it unlawfull:
to eat meat is lawfull, yet God forbids the eating of it when my
weak brother is offended at it: Suppoſe the Magiſtrate command
me to eat it, though he be offended if he do, I may not eat it, unleſſe
I may prefer Man before God: if you ſay, God commands me to
obey Authority, and that I ſin if I do not do it, I deny that I am in
this cauſe bound to obey the Magiſtrate, though the thing be in it
ſelf lawfull, man cannot bind when God will have us free; alſo if
that he hath power in ſuch things, then he may take away and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
me from indifferent things, and take away my liberty; which
were to ſet up Gods own, commanding things abſolutely neceſſary,
the other in things indifferent, how then ſhall I ſtand juſt in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
wherein Chriſt hath made me free, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1. We are tied to do
what they ſhould command more, then becauſe they command it,
the Magiſtrates power reacheth not to all civill things: it's my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
when to eat and what I ſhall eat, when I ſhall go to bed and
when to riſe, and what couler my cloathes ſhall be, and no man
may bind wherein God would have us free, nor can they make any
part of Gods Word to ceaſe to blind, and be of no force to me,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115558:10"/>
which before their command was of force to us, unleſſe he can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
with the Law of God. If the Parliament require me to betray
the Liberties of the People; I know he hath no power from God
to command me any ſuch thing, becauſe it's injurious to my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and contrary to the Law of Nature, which requireth not to
do, nor conſent, nor permit that which is deſtructive to others,
though Magiſtrates are a lawfull authority: it's a right ſtamp, but
if the metall be not that it ſhould, I will not take it unleſſe it be
good metall, as well as good coyne; that we ſhould be ſubject to the
wills of men in commands not convenient, that we ſhould ſin and
defile our ſelves, and incur damnation, becauſe we will not ſin, is
ſtrange Doctrine which the Bible never knew: it's lawfull for the
Magiſtrate to bid me run a horſe, but if in the place, children are ſo
ſcattred, that I ſee I cannot do it with ſafety, I had better break his
command, then murder or hurt children, and if he would do it, I
ought to ſtop him: God ſaith <hi>Let every one be fully perſwaded in his
owne mind.</hi> I am to judge of the lawfulneſſe and expediency of that
which I am to do; for all things may be lawfull that are not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
ſo much as a thing is not expedient it's unlawfull; the Army
were not ſatisfied that it was for their owne and the Kingdomes
ſafety for them to disband at that time, if they had but doubted of
the lawfullneſſe thereof, they ſhould not do well to disband, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
we are more ſtrictly tyed to the command of men then to
Gods: but many reaſons haue been given that it was not ſafe or beſt
for them ſo to do, therefore the Army are not to be blamed but
commended for what they have done, unleſſe it be lawfull for them
to do that which tends to their owne and the Kingdomes deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
if you ſay then they ſhould ſuffer; I deny it, but more of this
anon.</p>
            <p>Moreover it may ſo fall out that one may break the Letter of the
Law, and keep the Law, if he obſerve the intent of it, as <hi>Mal.</hi> 10. 1.
to you the intent of the Law is more the Law then the letter of it:
Suppoſe he that keeps the Gates of the City is commanded not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
them (without their order) to keep out the enemy, he
ſeeth betwixt the Gates and the Camp ſome differences and ſtrives,
and it's evident to him he can let them in and keep out the enemy,
and if he doeth it he hath broak the Letter of the Law but kept the
ſubſtance of the Law, if he had obſerved the Letter he had not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115558:10"/>
kept the intent of it: Suppoſe the Magiſtrate find fault with him
for not doing as he bid him, it's without a cauſe, he hath done no
hurt but good in ſaving their lives, who are without lyable to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
and ſo did the Army in not disbanding, had the Army
been a cauſe of their owne and our ſufferings, and they had loſt the
fruit of all their victories if they had laid downe their Armes ſome
others would have taken them up.</p>
            <p>You have ingaged your ſelves by Oath to preſerve his Majeſties Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and priviledge of Parliament; this is moſt cleare that no neceſſity
can juſtifie perjury or diſpenſe with lawfull oathes, the bond and tie of an
Oath and Covenant is religious and ſacred and invincible, who will
require it at your hands broken, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17. 14. And neceſſity cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
with an oath, nothing can give one leave to be forſworne, an oath is
of an abſolute indiſpenſible authority.</p>
            <p>If what you ſay be true, are you not perjured, miſerably for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworne?
have you forgot what you have ſworn, covenanted, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall
obedience, &amp;c. But of this more when you write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You take that for granted which is to prove; we deny
they are forſworn, your ſaying ſo is no proof; we are willing to put
it to the triall, and able to prove the contrary: The <hi>Oath</hi> (Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant)
<hi>is to be interpreted according to his ſenſe that gave it, and not in
his ſenſe that tooke it:</hi> this you would have; but it's not lawfull to
grant it; it is not to be interpreted neither in his ſenſe that gave it,
nor in his that takes it, but according to the expreſſe words of the
Covenant. If it were granted to either to put what ſenſe they
thought fit, they might ſweare one thing and do another, if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
it to inſlave. If a Presb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ter give or take the Covenant, he
thinks he ſweares to maintaine Presbyterian Government, of which
there is not the leaſt word mentioned in the Covenant: there is
mention of a government according to the Word of God, and that
is not their Presbytery, by their own confeſſion. The Aſſembly of
Divines confeſſe it is not <hi>jure divino,</hi> (I am miſtaken if they did not
ſweare the government of Archbiſhops was agreeable to the Word
of God) but the Presbytery is the neareſt to it; if ſo be but neare
to it, then it is not it. In the Scriptures is preſcribed a Government
for the Church, the Houſe of God; Presbytery they ſay is not it,
but neare to it. If then Presbyterian government had in expreſſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115558:11"/>
words been in the Covenant, and I had taken it, I could with a good
conſcience have broke my oath, for that oath that is not lawfull to
take, is not lawfull to be kept: it is not lawfull for me to ſweare to
maintain a government for Chriſts that is not his, though it be never
ſo neare it or like it. But ſay they, we ſwore to maintain that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
that is according to the beſt reformed Church; for each
of theirs is the beſt in their judgments and conſciences, els I ſhould
wonder if they ſhould approve and practiſe contrary to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences:
yea and he that denieth all Church-government, may take
the Covenant without ſcruple, becauſe the Covenant expreſſes none,
and he believes there is none; and when he ſeeth which it is, he will
owne it and defend it; and before it is unreaſonable to expect it
from him. I wonder the Prieſts ſhould ſo take the Covenant for the
text, and preach ſo on it: there is nothing in that which is ſo cleer
to them; what is plainly expreſſed, they cannot agree how the
words are to be read: the Prieſts read, to <hi>protect the perſon of the
King,</hi> and there make ſuch a full ſtop, and go no further<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> others
ſay they muſt read on, and take with it, <hi>in the defence, maintenance
and protection of the King in his juſt Rights;</hi> and what they are, men
cannot agree. Some ſay his juſt Rights are to be King, others ſay he
hath loſt all his juſt Rights: others ſay, it is his juſt right to loſe his
life: the Covenant reſolves this not; I cannot tell what are his juſt
Rights, nor can learn what the Covenant meanes or requires: I muſt
leave it to the Schollers, and thoſe that can tell. The like may be
ſaid for the other branches of the Covenant.</p>
            <p>If an oath be indiſpenſable, then perſons muſt ſin rather then
break it; and then the vow of ſingle life binds, be the cauſe what it
will; and ſo if any have ſworn to murder a thouſand perſons or
more, it ſeems they muſt do it: is not this the Popes Doctrine to
murder Kings and others, which is to be deteſted. That an oath
binds more then the Law of God we deny, and put you to prove it.
Is there not the higheſt authority in Gods commands? can any thing
bind us more then his commands; yet ye ſee <hi>Matth. 12. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to</hi> 7. they
are diſpenſible. You ſay, an <hi>oath is part of the worſhip of God:</hi> if it
be but a part of it, it is not more then the whole: alſo Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
muſt give place to acts of mercy and love; <hi>I will have mercy
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> not ſacrifice; Hoſea 6. 6. Mal.</hi> 12. 7. it was lawfull to neglect
the publike worſhip and command of God to give ſuck, &amp;c. in that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115558:11"/>
they were not blamed for not going to Jeruſalem to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
though all were commanded to goe thither: <hi>No ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
is ſufficient to dispenſe with a morall Law:</hi> is it not a
morall duty to worſhip God? ſwearing is a part of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
worſhip, but meerly naturall or morall, as you call
it: wee need not bee inforced to doe that which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall;
an oath that is detrimentall to a particular Law, muſt
bee kept, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. 4. I grant it, if it bee in that or the like
cauſe, but not in all cauſes that can be named: for, what is not
lawfull to ſweare, is not lawfull to be done becauſe they have
ſworn to doe it. <hi>No hunger can make ſtealing no ſtealing,
Proverbs</hi> chap. 6. verſ. 30. Wee allow not men when they
are hungry to take that which is not their owne; yet wee
ſay, that which in it ſelfe is ſtealing, may lawfully bee done
without ſin, if the hunger be of that extremity as to indanger
life, and no other help or remedy can be had, then it is not ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
yet reſtitution is to be made, to affirme it is ſtealing, is to
maintain that a man may ſin to ſave his life; (if I ought to
break the Oath, I am not forſworne to do it) when two duties
come together at one time, and I cannot do both, the one for
that preſent ceaſeth to be a duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this was <hi>Davids</hi> cauſe it
eating the Shew-bread; no man may tell a lye nor commit any
ſin to ſave his life, and that men ſhould take ſuch oathes as are
ſo intricate and diſputable, I would ſee Scripture for; I read an

ſwear what I ſhall do for the future is not ſo clear as ſome
would have it, if it be a duty, a reſtriction is as perfect or inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
as this you grant, I may ſwear I will protect and defend the
Magiſtrates perſon, &amp;c. but not in evill: if he after ſet upon me
to rob and kill me in the high-way, I will kill him rather then
be killed, the Law counts this no murder: if this be granted
the whole argument is granted. For he is as much a Magiſtrate
in the high-way as in another place, and if he may be reſiſted in
evill in one place more then in another.</p>
            <p>In ſmall matters (therefore in greater) if men binde
themſelves by oath, it concernes every one to take heed what
they do, to have a good ground for taking them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and great

heed leſt they break them. It is no ſlight matter to doe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe:
if lawfull, it is a ſin to break it; if unlawfull, it was a ſin
to make it. I heartily wiſh that men were more backward in
taking them, and more forward in keeping them, if they can
can keep them without ſin: if lawfull, to ſweare and not to
keep it is a great aggravation.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115558:13"/>
to overthrow the fundamentall conſtitution of the government of
the Kingdome, or to give power to any to do it:</hi> if they would
have taken away bad ones, and given us better, they had not

and if you pleaſe to try what truth is in it.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>It is a breach of priviledge to areſt and impriſon a Member of
Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is contrary to Law, he is an enemy to the State:</hi>
I grant it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a cauſe of a particular debt the intent of the Law
is good to prefer the publike before a particular, better one
perſon ſuffer then the Kingdome, for they are many: it is the
priviledge to the State for the Members freely to ſit, if this be
the intent of the Law, the Army kept this Law: for they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
the publike before particular perſons: it is a priviledge
to the Kingdome, for the Parliament to ſit and do them good,
for to that end they were ſent to ſit, but if their ſitting doeth
the Kingdome miſchiefe, then it is priviledge to the people to
hinder their ſitting: reaſons undeniable have been given to
prove the truth of this, namely that their ſitting tended to the
deſtruction of the Kingdome, therefore in hindering them they
have kept the Law, and done good ſervice to the Kingdome,
therefore the Kingdome are beholding to them for it: alſo the
people are not made for the Magiſtrates, but the Magiſtrates
for the people: therefore they muſt give place or be forced to
do ſo, when it is for the Kingdomes good: the Parliaments
priviledges are the peoples, therefore they did them no wrong
when they took them from them, and ſo reſerved them for the
people, as if all that I have is not my own, but others, when
they take it from me, they take but their own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I know your
judgement is contrary to mine, but mine is as infallible as yours:
if you can prove the contrary, I will give you leave to judge, in
the mean time, if you will judge what you pleaſe, I will take
the ſame liberty: the Parliaments power which they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
lawfully ſet over them, then their expreſſions and

If at any time a Precept of God muſt be ſuſpended with upon a neceſſity,

            </p>
            <p>The Members ſeized on were not mad, nor out of their wits, but ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
then the greater was their fact; and the more neceſſity there was
to ſeize on them, for if they doe ſo, when ſober, we cannot expect no

If no, then you in effect ſay, that if you felinto a ditch there would
you lye, and not get out; If you would uſe the beſt way for your ſelf and
others ſafety, we doe no more: They ſay, <hi>The Army are deſpiſers and

that they are lovers and affectors of it, ſecurers and Saviours of
an authority from being uſeleſſe in good, &amp; from being loſt. You ſay, <hi>We

and Covenant;</hi> were you of this minde, when you Petitioned
the Parliament, you might be free in Perſon and Purſe from any part of
the charge of this Warre: When I heard of that Petition at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of this Parliament, I thought it was either covetouſneſſe or
hypocriſie to be freed both in Perſon and Purſe, and yet ſo vehemently
preſſe others; to both, I deſire thoſe in Authority to conſider, that
you may according to your abilitie beare the burthen with the reſt:
<hi>Geree</hi> asketh, <hi>If the High Sheriffe becauſe he hath power to reſcue one whom
he in his conſcience knowes is unjuſtly ſentenced to death</hi> by the Judge, &amp;c.
I ask him, If the people did well or ill, in reſcuing Jonathan <hi>that he dyed

            </p>
            <p>What, for not obeying unlawfull commands, God hath given them

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115558:14"/>
its not Gods will that we ſhould be deſtroyed for doing well; <hi>If
ye doe well who will harme you,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 18. Therefore they have no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from God to doe it; <hi>You muſt ſubmit and ſuffer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not reſiſt, as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant

4. 15. if God hath given him no ſuch power, if I reſiſt, I reſiſt not the
ordinance of God, nor the power of God. If I can avoyd it, doe not I
increaſe his ſin, and am guilty of my owne death?</p>
            <p>If I muſt ſuffer and not reſiſt, if the Magiſtrate will take away my
life unjuſtly, its not lawfull for me to make an eſcape from the preſent

muſt be ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>New Lights tell us, That we need not ſuffer, but when me are evill doers;</hi>
We ſay, He need not if he can help it, if he cannot, there is neceſſity for

So the Church met privately becauſe of the <hi>Jewes:</hi> the Saints ſuffered
and they could not help it. If a ſervant in ſtrength can preſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
he runs himſelfe into a greater inconvenience by reaſon of the

Army was twenty thouſand, they were divided in two or three Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies

Parliament were ſomething ſlow they need be quickned. I perceive you
are not of their minds that conceit they waited on them too long, and ſo
continued (or permitted) them to ſin, yet they muſt be let alone; to let
looſe a Lyon &amp; a beare is not ſo dangerous to the people as your princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

of the Kingdom; God was pleaſed in his Government to change

ſome laws, and muſt not ours admit of no change the peoples judgments

there will be a great change; if a new moddell of Law and Government
be beſt for the Kingdom, there is no hurt done.</p>

and promiſe to do that which they cannot do, or may not lawfully do:
its a fault to ſay it, but a greater to do it: promiſes that cannot be kept

               <hi>There is not a word of tolleration in the Remonstrance,</hi> the fiteſt place for

injuſtice of your accuſations cauſe you to ſtinke. I could diſcover the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifiablenes
of your charges; but I count them not worth the anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
you ſay <hi>they walke by providence without a precept, the providence of
God is often pleaded in juſtifying your way;</hi> its an obſervation not a rule, I
am confident they do deny that the providence of God is not the rule
and ground of their actions, much leſs contrary to the word; the ground
of their actions is the word of God, and if they had not acted by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
they had not done that they have; its but a falſe accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they obſerve both. The rule of the Word of God, and the rule of
his providence, God is ſeene in both: the providence of God declares his
will as well as his word, although not in the ſame way; by his providence
we come to ſee his will. Chriſt would have us to take notice of a ſmall

is it ſufficient for you to writ your ſelves Paſtors, &amp; Miniſters of the
Goſpel, as you doe: ſeeing you are not ſo, have you any other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
then that you have received of the Biſhops, and of each other
of your ſelves. Can he that hath a falſe ordination, or none at all, make
a true Officiall Miniſter, that will not endure the triall, nor will it prove
you to be the Officiall Miniſter and Paſtors of Chriſt, if ye doe the ſame
work they did; no more, then if a ſtranger ſhould doe all that a husband
doth to his wife, will prove him to be her husband, who were never ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
yet it will bee hard for you to prove that, to read Service,
Church women, Matry, and Bury the dead, ſprinkle Infants, give the
Supper to the Pariſh, &amp;c. is the worke of the Miniſters of Chriſt. Did
the Miniſters of Chriſt in the Scripture, perfect the Saints after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;

are exerciſed in matters devine, or is it becauſe you are made pertakers
of the devine nature; you give us great cauſe to queſtion both, becauſe
the ſpirituall man diſcerneth all things: but you make it appeare, that
you are blind in the things of God and man, if both be true, many
Tradeſmen may be called Devines, as well as you, ſeeing the reaſon is
the ſame; it ſeemes you cannot tell your own name: you are ſo learned
as appeares <hi>Eſay.</hi> 44. 25. Nor will that which you call Converſion, prove

might be given. I am in haſte, therefore I will preſent but one more.
Doctor <hi>Fulke</hi> confeſſeth in his Confutation of the <hi>Remiſh Teſtament,</hi>
of a Woman who converted a great many in the Iſland, where ſhe was

            <p>None were to have Tithes but the Leviticall Prieſthood, and when
that Miniſtry ceaſed, their maintenance ceaſed: ſo that to take or pay
Tithes is to deny Chriſt in the fleſh. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. are Prophets,
Miniſters, Paſtors, any thing, every thing, nothing.</p>
            <p>Mocke and ſcorne the Prophet, <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> deſpiſe the miniſtry of
Chriſt, <hi>of Antichriſt,</hi> falſe Prophets transformed, calling them Antichriſtian,
<hi>the Parliament hath noted you to be ſo, and you are ſo; for if the
Biſhops calling be Antichriſtian, and all the Offices depending on the
Hiryarchy, your Offices and miniſtry is a braunch of the Hiryarchy,
the Statute Law is againſt any</hi> Seminary Prieſt, or Ecleſiaſticall perſon

So that it doth appeare that ſuch as own the Pope to be a true
Miniſter, and retain any ordination derived from him, are guilty of
treaſon, and ſuch as receive or maintain them, are guilty of felony
and treaſon: and that the Miniſtry of England is derived eſſentially

            <p>It cannot be denied, but the Biſhops did ordain men Prieſts, a
full Prieſt, or a halfe Prieſt, as appears by the Book of Ordination
of Miniſters. Many are ſo ſimple and plain naked, that they writ
themſelves Prieſt of ſuch a place, ſo that you have no offices but a
Prieſthood; what prieſthood is it? is it the Popes? are you <hi>Moſes</hi>

            <p>The Prieſts ſay that we know not the originall, and our Bibles

Copies, why not others upon thoſe that did it upon oath, Doctor
<hi>Fulke</hi> in his confutation of the Rhemiſh Teſtament juſtifieth the
Engliſh tranſlation of the Bible. But we receive not the truth by
tradition: I would know of you that are ſo for Hebrew and Greek,
&amp;c. if the knowledge of the tongues bee ſufficient to teach thoſe
that have thoſe tongues the mind of the ſpirit of God in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
or no? if yea, then all that know theſe tongues know the mind
of God, if no, then it is but an inſufficient helpe, and what is an
inſufficient helpe worth more then nothing, the knowledge of
Greek and Hebrew is a help to Read a Greek and Hebrew Bible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
elſe they cannot read them. So the knowledge of the Engliſh
tongue is of neceſſity to read the Engliſh Bible: the cauſe is the
ſame: but the underſtanding the Engliſh tongue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and reading it in
the Bible cannot give them to underſtand, the meaning of it no
more than the knowledge of the toungs Greek and Hebrew though
it helps them to read the Bible in thoſe toungs, yet is not able to
give them to underſtand the meaning of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that this is ſo, ſome of
them, who know the toungs confeſſe: for <hi>Apollo</hi> was a learned man
he ſaw the firſt copies of the Bible if that could have cauſed him to

<hi>the mind of God</hi> as he did, <hi>Acts.</hi> 18. 26. alſo what is the reaſon
that thoſe that know the toungs cannot agree among themſelves,
what is the mind of God in his word, that ſome of you in your

expoſitions are as contrary to each other as light is to darkneſſe,
<hi>the naturall man cannot perceive the things that be of God</hi> a naturall

Jeſuits are good Scholer, &amp;c. they know the toungs, &amp;c. then it

nor perceive the things of God: <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was a great
Scholler and teacher in <hi>Iſrael</hi> yet how ſimple was he concerning
the meaning of Chriſts words, tell me then what a help their

by his ſpirit, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 10. he ſaith not by Greeke and Hebrew, if
our tranſlation be true then we can tell the meaning of it as well as
you; if it be not true tell me what is that Preaching worth that is
proved by a falſe tranſlation, and if we muſt believe contrary to
our tranſlation becauſe you ſay ſo, what is this but an implicite
faith and humane? and ſeeing you ſo differ among your ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the meaning of the word or the mind of God in it, tell me,

know you which of them is the mind of God in that place, unleſſe
he reveale it to you? and if God pleaſe he can reveale it to a ſimple
man, and God doth doe ſo, and this is that for which Chriſt
<hi>thanks his father, becauſe he hath hid theſe things from the wiſe and the
learned, and revealed it unto babes, the viſion of all is become unto you
as the words of a booke that is ſealed, which men deliver to one that is

neither of them can read it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both put it off they cannot underſtand

in Greek and Hebrew he could underſtand it: but the former
who was ſuch a learned man could not doe it, its hid from the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
its not in being learned, nor in not being learned: what then

therefore they doe not know it; God ſaith <hi>None can know the things

            <p>The knowledge of Greeke, Hebrew and Engliſh are all
humane learning of equall excellency, neceſſity, and uſe for the

there is the ſame uſe and helpe and neceſſity of the Engliſh
toung as of the Greek or Hebrew tongue; ſo there is the ſame to
be ſaid for the French and Dutch tongue, and all other tongues
and why the Greek and Hebrew tongues ſhould be of any more
uſe and excellency then other tongues, there is no reaſon to be

his people may dwell quietly and ſafely, &amp;c. God hath blaſted them
that would have kept us from our ſweeteſt liberty. The King and his
Biſhops denyed it to us, and God hath blaſted them, thoſe of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
promiſed liberty to us, but did not give it us, God hath blaſted
them; the Synod, with the Miniſtry of <hi>England</hi> ſhould have ſpoken for
us, and they ſpoke againſt us, and God hath blaſted them, many of
them are as the dung upon the earth abhorred, and if the Army had
neglected us herein God would have blaſted them, <hi>Jeruſalem is a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome

neglected us it would have been their ſinne, griefe and trouble hereafter,

Though mens mouths cannot be ſtopped from exclayming againſt them

Judge what is truth, and what is error in Religion, then it doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that the Magiſtrate muſt have a certainty of knowledge in all opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
and cauſes in Religion, elſe how is he able to judge which is the
truth, and if he hath not ſuch knowledge, may he be owned fit for a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
it wil be a doubt whether it be lawful for any to be a Magiſtrate
that hath not ſuch knowledg as his work requires: and by this rule we ſhal
have no Magiſtrate at all, becauſe no man hath ability of knowledge to
determine in all cauſes and doubts in Religion.</p>
            <p>2. If the Magiſtrate is to determine what is truth, whether it wil not
follow that we muſt beleeve and live by the Magiſtrates faith, and change
our Religion at their pleaſure, and if they will approve of no Religion,
it ſeems we muſt have no Religion at all: the Saints in Scripture are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

be perſecuted, they will call truth blaſphemy; the truth hath but a
few to own it, the world are like to outroot them, and then we are
judged and noted hereticks and muſt ſuffer: the army deſired per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
of the truth and people of God might ceaſe: they ſaw the
name of ſettling Religion to be but a pretence to eſtabliſh errour
and perſecution, and that ſo long as lawes were made concerning
Religion, the Kingdom could not be quiet, they are againſt ſuffring
of errors as much as you, they deſire ſome might be appointed to
write againſt errors, they knew that the judgements and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of men doe ſo differ, that it is not poſſible they could ſubmit to
one way of Religion, and that we ought to do as we would be done
unto: if one man is to be puniſhed for his errors, then all men muſt
be puniſhed, becauſe no man is free from error: all truth is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
one ſort of men: there is no man doth judge his own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
erronious; they that now hold errors, may hold the truth:
if there were no error, it could not be known what is truth, or not
be ſo glorious, it is not in the power of man to believe what he wil,
and as he will: the mind of man is perſwaded with great reaſons
(truly ſo or ſo apprehended) will he, nil he, if hee ſhould doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
he ſhould do contrary to his own judgement and conſcience,
which God forbid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. They could not ſee it, that it was fit to
make ſuch ſole Judges in matters of Religion, who are not infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and as liable to error as others; they could not find a man that
could ſhew his authority from God that he ſhould puniſh with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
puniſhments men for their errors: if ye ſay that <hi>every man
may live as he liſt:</hi> had not he as good live as he liſt, as live as you
liſt; but, <hi>we are bound by oath to a Reformation in ſuppreſſing of errors
&amp;c.</hi> but it is to be according to the word of God, not againſt it.
Shew us the patterne in Chriſts Teſtament to puniſh ſuch as hold
errors with corporall puniſhment: <hi>then errors muſt be ſuffered.</hi> Woe
muſt ſuffer that which we cannot help, neceſſity hath no law: it is no
more in our power to hinder errors then it was in the Biſhops,
power to hinder mens ſpeaking and writing againſt them: if you
can ſay to the blind and ſet, open the eyes of their underſtanding;
expell the darkneſſe that is in men, and command the heart and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
it, and deſcry the vaine imaginations of mens hearts, and
prevent Satans ſuggeſting error into men, and hinder men from
ſpeaking each of other, and place light in the ſoule, and give the
holy Spirit to men to direct and reforme them. If you cannot doe
theſe things, you cannot ſuppreſſe errors, <hi>then errors will prevaile</hi>
