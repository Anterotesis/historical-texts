            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It is ſaid, that the abatement of the Cuſtome on Coales exported (as now inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) from 8 <hi>s.</hi> to 1 <hi>s.</hi> in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and from 16 <hi>s.</hi> to 8 <hi>s.</hi> (in Strangers Ships) <hi>per</hi> Chaldron, will occaſion a greater Export of the Commodity (becauſe cheapneſs ſuppoſes Encreaſe of Conſumption,) and conſequently advantage the Coal-Owner, encreaſe the Navigation, and be a great benefit to the <hi>English</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

That Coale beyond the Seas is uſed in Manufacture: not for common burning as in <hi>England,</hi> not onely for that Coale (Cuſtome free) cannot be delivered abroad ſo cheap as the fuell there, but for that Coale is offenſive and not burnable in the Stoves uſed abroad. In <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and all the Linnen-bleaching parts (of the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces) the burning thereof is abſolutely forbidden: A Tunn or large Herring-Barrell of Turffe (a pleaſant and ſweet ſubſtantiall Fyring; and they have plenty of it) is bought (in the ſeaſon) for the value of 8 <abbr>

In <hi>France</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King hath impoſed upon the Commodity by the Tunnage and otherwiſe, that its not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to render them cheaper there then Wood, if the burning of Coale were at all affected and not abhorred; and if we abate, he may raiſe his duties for encreaſe of his Revenue, and yet his Subjects pay no more for the Commodity then now they do. The Navyes of <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> uſe a little of this Commodity, the reſt of the World none. And for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture the ſaid Stranger abroad muſt have Coale, though it ſhould coſt him 4 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> a Chalder, Engliſh Coale was ſold in <hi>Holland</hi> at the Cloſe of the late Warr for 25 Guilders <hi>per</hi> Hoodt, of which two makes about a <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> Chalder, and yet they had Coale brought thither from <hi>Luyck</hi> and other parts. He that has a Commodity that another wants will make the moſt of it.</p>

               </abbr> the Exportation was not leſs; as by the books may appear. And if it were raiſed to that again, a proportionable augmentation of Rent is proffered, and will be given for it, if farmed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have already beat the <hi>Scots</hi> out of this Trade (and many of their works are failed) by ſelling the Commodity ſo very cheap as it now is; (ſo that no benefit on that ſide is to be expected from the intended abatement;) and Coales are now dearer at <hi>London</hi> then in <hi>Holland.</hi> The bare duties of a Chalder of Coales brought from <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> are now 6 <abbr>

            <p n="5">5. The dearer we ſell a Commodity abroad, which the Stranger cannot be without(and will not encreaſe his Conſumption for Cheapneſs, any more then we would ſpend more Salt if it were cheaper,) the more we bring back to enrich the Nation.</p>
            <p>If it be asked whence the preſent great Conſumption of the Commodity in <hi>England</hi> was introduced? It is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, not from Cheapneſs (for Coale is gradually grown dearer) but from the decay and deſtruction of Wood, which by degrees hath brought us to ſo great uſe of Coale.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It hath not been the Cuſtome of this Nation to impoſe upon the Stranger more then double Cuſtome for our Native Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, That both they and we might go to market; but as the duty is now intended the Stranger ſhall pay eight times as much <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

By which particulars (ready to be proved when required) it appeareth that the publick Revenue will be leſſened, the Navigation diminiſht, and a neceſſary Commodity under-valued, to the benefit of the Stranger, without other recompence to the Nation.
