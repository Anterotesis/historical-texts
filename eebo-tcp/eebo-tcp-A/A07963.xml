            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <note place="margin">Philip. 3.8.</note> This know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was so deare to the Princely Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi>: that he desired to be but a doore-keeper in Gods house, rather then to dwel in the goodly Pallaces of great Parsonages: esteeming one day better in Gods Church, then a thousand other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.<note place="margin">Psal. 84. vers. 10.</note> This knowledge yeelded so sweete a sauour in the nosethrels of holy <hi>Moses</hi>: that he chose rather to be the childe of <hi>God,</hi> then to be called the sonne of King <hi>Phoraohs</hi> daughter. <note place="margin">Heb. 11. vers. 24. Pro. 1.7.

            <p>And no marueile, that the true Children of <hi>God,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the true knowledge of <hi>God,</hi> before all other things. For as our <hi>Sauiour</hi> himselfe teacheth vs, this knowledge is life eternall, the ioy of all ioyes.

Howe then commeth it to passe, that the late Byshops of <hi>Rome,</hi> (now <hi>Cat' e'xochen</hi> called Popes,) doe this day sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the light of the Gospel, and forbid the Lay-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to read the holy Scriptures in their vulgar language? How chanceth it, that none may read any Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries vpon the old and newe Testament, nor any other bookes compiled for the furthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of mans knowledge in that behalfe? vnlesse either the said bookes &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, be composed by professed papists: or the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders being the Popes sworne vassals, haue his dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and licence so to doe?</p>
            <p>This (my good Lord,) is the reason, that cannot in truth be denied. They that doe euill hate the light, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that it should reproue their naughtie deedes.<note place="margin">Iohn 3.20.</note> And
<pb facs="tcp:1682:3"/>
 for this end is it, that the Pope can not endure the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of Gods word, which is a lanterne vnto our feete, &amp; a bright shining light vnto our soules, directing vs the path-way to heauen. <note place="margin">Psal. 119.105. 2 pet. 1.19.

            <p> In regard hereof, (most honourable Baron) and most worthy, zealous, christian, vpright, and religious Magistrate,) because it is not enough for a Christian to know God himselfe, but he must withall, heartily wish and effectually procure, (so much as lyeth in him,) that others may also know and worship the euer-liuing God with him: <note place="margin">Leu. 19.18.

                     <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> and <hi>Scotus,</hi> men to much delighted with subtilties, haue brought Confesson this day to such a passe: that <hi>Ihoannes Geilerius,</hi> that famous, graue, and holy Diuine, who preached many yeares at <hi>Argenteratum,</hi> saide many a time vnto his friends, that it was impossible for a man to make his Confession, according to their traditions.</q>

               <p>Out of these words, I obserue these golden Lessons: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, that the vaine curious distinctions of the popish Schoole-doctors, haue brought much mischiefe into the Church of God, Which thing if a papist had not spoken it, would neuer haue beene thought credible to the worlde: the truth will preuaile in time, <hi>Christs</hi> holy Gospel must haue the vpper hand. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that it is impossible for a papist to make his Confession, according to the popish law: and consequently (marke well my words gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) that all by popish doctrine, must perish euerlastingly; I proue it, ponder well the proofe. <note place="margin">Alas, alas, who will not defie Poperie.</note> The papists teach vs, to hold for an Article of our beleife, that we are bound vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on paine of damnation, to make our Confessions as the popes Lawes and Cannons doe prescribe. <hi>Viz.</hi> as <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Scotus,</hi> haue set downe the same.

And for all that, <hi>Geilerius</hi> a papist himselfe, a great Diuine, and a famous preacher, complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned often to his deare friends, that no man could possibly performe the same.</p>
               <p>Now then, since on the one side, the popish confession must be made vnder paine of damnation: and since on the otherside none possibly can make the same, as is required

               <p>Thus writeth this Pope; a learned man indeede. Whose testimonie, (seeing hee was a most famous pope,) must needes be of highest credite with all papists in the worlde.

<q>Sentence was giuen in the assembly of the fathers against the obstinate, that they should be burnt, who refused the doctrine of the church; and withall, the heresie of <hi>Wiclif</hi> was condemned.

Thus writeth <hi>Nanclerus.</hi> Out of whose words, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue sundry very memorable points of Doctrine: wishing the reader to ponder them seriously, for his godly instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Christian edification. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, that this <hi>Nanclerus</hi> was a great papist, highly renowned in the church of <hi>Rome</hi>; and consequently, that hee will testifie no more against the Papists, then the truth it selfe doth extort from his penne. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that the Papists most cruelly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Maister <hi>Hus</hi> to the fire: albeit hee had the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours free pasport and safe conduct, freely to goe, and freely to returne. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that the godly Martyr <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronimus de Praga,</hi> came boldly of his owne accord vnto the councell: and they stoutly defended the truth, mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre the malice of the pope &amp; all his popish vassals. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the burning of Maister <hi>Hus</hi> could not terrifie Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Hierome</hi> of <hi>Praga,</hi> nor make him deny the truth of Christs Gospell. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, that both Maister <hi>Husse</hi> and Maister <hi>Hieronimus de Praga,</hi> went as merily and as ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to the fire to bee burnt, as if they had beene inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a royall banquet. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sxtly, that in the midst of the late fire, they ioyfully and Christianly sang an Hymne, to the honour and praise of the euerliuing God. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seuenthly, that the furie and rage of the hote burning fire, (O most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and constant Martyrs of Iesus Christ,) coulde not stay them from singing, and from praysing our mercifull God. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eightly, that the cruell papists, after they had burnt the blessed Martyrs, and consumed their bodies and their bones to ashes, did cast their ashes into a deepe poole of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Ninthly, that these two blessed men, (<hi>Iohn Hus</hi> and <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> of <hi>Praga</hi>) were no lesse honoured for martyrs in <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> then <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were in <hi>Rome.</hi> Yea, their death was
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1682:22"/>
so pretious with God, and so honorable with the godly in their countrey: that mauger the Pope and all his Romish tyrannie, the Gospell hath euer since their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning continued there: which is for the space almost of two hundred yeares, euen within the kingdome and dominion of that Empire, a thing impossible to bee done by man, if God did not support the same.</p>
               <p>The like crueltie was extended vppon the body and bones of Maister <hi>Bucer,</hi> that holy man, profound Doctor, and stout champion of Gods eternall truth. For after the blessed man had beene dead, and a long time couered with earth in his graue: his body was taken vppe, fast bound with an yron chaine to a stake, and burnt with a great fire vpon the market day in open place. <note place="margin">At Cambridge in the dayes of Cardinal poole A<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> D, 1556.</note> Insomuch, that some of the market-folkes, when they perceiued the wonderfull affaires in hand, saide merily one to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what neede is there of yron chaines and Armed men, against dead bodies that haue beene a long time in the graue? for they can neither resist, nor yet flye away, but the late popes are so bent to brutish cruelty, that the like tyranny hath beene by one Pope to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For pope <hi>Sergius</hi> the third, caused the corps of pope <hi>Formosus,</hi> (who now had beene dead almost ten yeares,) to bee taken out of his tombe, and to bee set in a chaire with the pontificall attyre vppon him, (O braue gallant!) and that done, hee commaunded his head to bee cut off, and to bee cast into the riuer <hi>Tyber.</hi> He disanulled the actes and orders giuen by pope <hi>Formosus,</hi> insomuch as all were enforced to take orders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, (O holy romish priesthood! ô indelible characer) who had bin ordered by pope <hi>Formosus.</hi> And all this was done forsooth, because <hi>Formosus</hi> had kept this <hi>Sergius</hi> from the Pope-dome. Thus write <hi>Martinus Polonus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Baptista Platina,</hi> two famous popish doctors: whereof the one was the popes <hi>Poenitentiarius,</hi> and the other, his <hi>Abbreuiator A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicus.</hi>

Thus much for a taste, of popish more then sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage tyrannie: who so listeth to know more thereof, may peruse my booke of Suruey. What a thing is this? we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue many of vs, that the popes are Christs Vicars vpon earth, and yet we see they are most cruell tyrants, euen the catch-poles, and bond-slaues of the maister Diuel of hell.

For of it dependeth all that estimation and credite, which is ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vnto pardons. If thou take away purgatorie, to what end shall pardons be needfull? For if there be no purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, we shall haue no need of pardons, Considering there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, how long purgatorie was vnknowne: then, that some beleeued it by little and little, partly by revelations, and partly by the Scriptures, and so at the length the whole Church receiued it, wee doe easily vnderstand the cause of pardons.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1682:26"/>
(gentle Reader,) that poperie crept into the Church by little and little, and not all at one time. This is a point of great importance, which woundeth the papists euen at the heart.</p>

<q>Gods workes are perfect.</q>

I proue this, because (as the Byshop auoucheth,) the Scriptures made purgatorie knowne to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but vnperfectly. For doubtlesse if God made purgatorie knowne by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, then is purgatorie either made perfectly knowne by them, or else Gods workes, that is, the holy Scriptures, are vnperfect. But I wil rather beleeue <hi>Moses,</hi> the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of God, then my L. our <hi>Fisher,</hi> though he be the popes cononized martyr. The other, that the Church hath no new reuelations, touching matters of Faith. For the most learned popish Schooleman, their religious Fryer, &amp; reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Byshop <hi>Melchior Canus,</hi> hath these expresse wordes:<note place="margin">Canus in locis, lib. 3. cap. 4. pag. 101.</note>

<q>Neither hath the Church any new reuelations, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning matters of Faith.</q>

Loe, poperie is contemned by her owne deare doctors: for M. <hi>Fisher,</hi> saith plainly, that purgatorie was not knowne at the first, but after many 100<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> years by revelations. Yet M. <hi>Canus,</hi> his popish brother &amp; fellow by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, (a man as learned as hee,) saith as plainly, and more truely,) that the Church hath no new revelations in faith. So then, either purgatorie is no matter of Faith, or else it came not by late revelations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:1682:26"/>Let the papist answere what he can and wil, he must needs here be caught by the heele. Fiftly, that pardons came not vp, till purgatorie was found out: the reason whereof is said to be this: because the life of popish pardons, resteth wholy in the life of popish purgatorie, and consequently, when the pope could get no saile for his pardons, it was high time for his holinesse to inuent his purgatorie. And therefore wisely saith his Byshop, and our <hi>Fisher</hi> of <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> that when the silly ignorant people, were put in feare of the paines of popish purgatorie: then began the popes pardons to florish, and to bee of high esteeme: as being thought able to preserue and defende their receiuers, from the paine and flame of purgatorie fire.

Which power they manifested practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, when they deposed three popes, and placed a fourth man in the pope-dome. Yea, the Councell auoucheth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly and most christianly, that the councell is aboue the pope, as is already proued.

               <p>The 71. excommunication, is against all such as shall boldly affirme, either that the blessed virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in originall sinne, or not so conceiued; and therevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall condemne them of heresie, or of mortall sinne, that hold, preach, or defend the contrary.

By which we may see the vncertaintie of the popes doctrine, as also his ignorance in the high my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of his owne religion. For, though he cannot erre iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially in matters of doctrine, as the papists holde and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue; yet can he not decide and determine this easie questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was conceiued in originall sinne, or not.

<q>Furthermore, I am to tell you, that relation was made to vs a while agoe, that when your fraternitie beheld some who adored and worshipped Images, then you brake in pieces the Images of the church, &amp; hurled them away. And truly, I commend your zeale therein, least any thing made with hands should be adored. Yet I iudge, that you should not haue broken the same Images. For Images are placed in churches to this end, that they which cannot read stories in the booke, may read them by sight on the walles. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your fraternity should not haue broken them, but haue forbidden the people to adore them: that so the vnlearned might haue gathered the knowledge of the historie, &amp; the people not haue sinned in worshipping the picture.</q>

Thus writeth the holy, learned, and auncient Byshop, or Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> Out of whose words, I obserue these worthy &amp; gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den lessons. First, that Images may not be worshipped. Secondly, that Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> commendeth the zeale of the good Byshop <hi>Serenus,</hi> who brake the images in pieces,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1682:35"/>
which the people worshipped. Thirdly, that though Images were in those dayes permitted for instruction-sake: yet were the people neuer permitted to worship them, but sharpely reproued in that behalfe.</p>
               <p>To which <hi>I</hi> adde, that this <hi>Gregorie,</hi> who was Byshop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and this <hi>Serenus,</hi> who was Byshop of <hi>Massilia,</hi> did both of them liue more then fixe hundred yeeres after <hi>Christ</hi>: at which time, the worship done to Images, was deemed a very heynous crime.

                  <q>Passio D. N. I. Christi, merita B. Virg. Mariae, &amp; omnium sanctorum, &amp; quicquid boni feceris vel mali susti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueris, sit tibi in remissionem peccatorum tuorum, in augmentum gratiae, &amp; in praemium vitae aeternae.</q>

Englished thus.

<q>The passion of our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> the merites of the blessed virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and of all Saints, be vnto thee for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of thy sinnes, for increase of grace, and for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of eternall life.</q>

Behold here, the daily practise of the Romish church. For first, we see the merits of Saints ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as a fellow-commissioner, too and with the holy pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of our Lord <hi>Iesus.</hi> Then, we see remission of sinnes and eternall glory, ascribed not onely to the merites of the blessed virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> (whom I honour and reuerence in mine heart, as the dearest childe of God, and most blessed Saint in heauen) but also to the merits of all Saints. Yet not onely the blessed virgin, but God himselfe is by this means, most highly dishonoured, his holy name blasphemed, and his proper glory giuen to his creatures. And for this ende did the most blessed virgin, make this answere to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell; Behold the seruant of the Lorde; be it vnto me, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy word.<note place="margin">Luke 1. cap. ver. 38.
