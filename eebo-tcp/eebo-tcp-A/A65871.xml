            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere's two or three Falacies in the very Title of the said Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> In charging what's contain'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in upon the <hi>Quakers</hi> in general, as being <hi>their Principles, Doctrines, Laws and Orders,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas in truth, divers of them are neither the <hi>Quakers</hi> Principles, Laws, nor Orders, but disown'd by the said People, though this Nameless Author has unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly represented them, as if they were some Principles all intirely Transcribed, and that from the <hi>Quakers</hi> in general, without exception, which is a notorious abuse; For 'tis also very Obvious, That many of them are very Partially, unfairly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriously cited, minced, curtalized, Pickt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pach't, and scrap'd up, thereby wronging some former Antient Writings of perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Persons deceased, and not here to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106676:3"/>
answer for themselves (as <hi>George Fox, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Burroughs, Francis Howgill, John Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyet, William Smith, John Audland, Josiah Cole,</hi> and others, and some yet alive abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) Others very falsly represented, being taken on Trust on an Implicit Faith, out of our Long-since Refuted Adversaries Books and Pamphlets.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> That those pretended Principles and Doctrines &amp;c. of the <hi>Quakers</hi> (at least ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them) are Rendered to be of danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Consequence; When we can easily make it appear that Many of them, even as cited by this Obscure Accuser, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the holy Scriptures, and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of Holy Men, consequently not of any dangerous Consequence (though in many things the Libeller appears very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious as well as Envious.) Whereupon I enquire.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What dangerous Consequence can be in our Knowing or Believing our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection (<hi>i. e.</hi> in Christ) before the World began? pag. 1. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Or what dangerous Consequence in our believing or Testifying that Christ hath given us Discerning and Judgment? Or that we are of God, and they that own God will own us, or any who are his Children?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:106676:3"/>3. Or in our Believing the Tabernacle of God to be with us, that is with all his People whom we include as <hi>of us,</hi> or <hi>with us,</hi> who are not against us (nor Envious, nor exalted in Pride, or Self-conceit) but looking towards the Lord, as in every Nation and People they that truly fear God and work Righteousness, they are accepted, and so far <hi>of us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. What dangerous Consequence can be in asserting, That Christ's Ministry or Teaching, is to Bring up the Hearers to Perfection, to the measure of stature and fulness of Christ? <hi>pag.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Can none (<hi>Quakers</hi> or others) in these Dayes, truly declare that they are or may be moved by the Immediate Spirit and Power of God to Write or Preach without dangerous Consequence? <hi>pag.</hi> 2, 3.</p>
            <p n="6">6. What dangerous Consequence can be in asserting, That they that have the Form and not the Power, and that are not Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their Counsel and Judgment in their Ministry, are none of Christ's Ministers? <hi>pag.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Is not the Spirit of Christ Infallible, and the Ministry thereof Infallible? And are any Christ's Ministers who have not his Spirit to Instruct them? <hi>pag.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:106676:4"/>8. The distinction between the <hi>Letter,</hi> and the <hi>Word or Spirit,</hi> and between the Ministry of the Letter, and that of the Spirit, <hi>pag.</hi> 3, 4. as between the Shadow and Substance, the meer <hi>Writing</hi> in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Characters, and the <hi>holy divine Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi> and <hi>Truths</hi> therein contained, (or holy Scriptures as intending the same) Is so Scriptural, that I know no true Christian will deny such distinction, muchless deem it of dangerous Consequence: (We never esteemed or called the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> (that is the <hi>Holy Doctrines,</hi> or Precepts thereof) but <hi>a Dead Letter,</hi> &amp;c. This Matter is fully answered and explained in a late Treatise, entituled, <hi>Antichrist in Flesh Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask'd</hi>; and in many others. But yet further.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Section</hi> 8. Touching the Scriptures, implying that we call them the <hi>Husk,</hi> the <hi>Letter</hi> which <hi>Killeth, Earthly</hi> and <hi>Carnal Letter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This is not Justly nor truly stated, and may Cause mistake and Misapprehension, as if the Divine and Christian Doctrine and Testimonies contained in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were included in the Term <hi>Letter, Husk,</hi> &amp;c. which could not be the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any of our Friends in that case, but of the meer outward Writings, as in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106676:4"/>
               <hi>Paper,</hi> and <hi>Ink,</hi> the <hi>Shadows</hi> and <hi>Types,</hi> the <hi>Legal</hi> and outward Ministration as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished and Separated from that of the <hi>Spirit, Life</hi> and <hi>Substance, Cor.</hi> 3.6, 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.29. Please also to take <hi>G. F</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation and Sence, that <hi>by Letter,</hi> he means <hi>Paper</hi> and <hi>Ink,</hi> but saith the <hi>Scripture the thing</hi> it speaks of is <hi>Spiritual,</hi> the <hi>Word is Spirit,</hi> Great Mystery, <hi>fol.</hi> 78. And further he Explains, viz. <hi>the Scripture it self without the Spirit that gave it forth, is a dead Letter in it self; the Spirit is it that gave forth the Scriptures</hi>; Gr. Mist. <hi>fol.</hi> 127.</p>
            <p>Wherein he distinguisheth between the meer <hi>Letter</hi> and the <hi>holy Scripture,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Letter</hi> and the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> between the <hi>Writings</hi> and the <hi>Gospel</hi> or <hi>Word</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared of, because the one will decay, the other is permanent, the Books and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings in Ink and Paper will wear out, so will not the <hi>Word: Iehoiakim</hi> King of <hi>Judah</hi> could Burn <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s <hi>Roll,</hi> or <hi>Book</hi> writ with <hi>Ink by Barach,</hi> but not the <hi>Word</hi> of the Lord, nor the Words thereof; for the same <hi>Word</hi> caused all the former Words to be Written again after the Roll was burnt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 36. This is no contempt of the Scripture, no more then it is of the Earth and the Heavens, to say they shall Wax Old and Perish. But the Word that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106676:5"/>
made them, Endureth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 102.25, 26. <hi>Heb</hi> 1.11, 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dust,</hi> cannot properly be said of the holy Scriptures, or Doctrine; but that the <hi>Letter</hi> or <hi>Writing</hi> will decay, and some pervert it; and in setting the <hi>Shadow</hi> above the <hi>Substance,</hi> and the <hi>Letter</hi> above the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and thinking to have eternal Life therein, will not come to Christ, that they might have Life. The Devil and Serpents have perverted and abused the Scriptures, and turned the Truth thereof into a Lye. But the Truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, the Truth is Truth still, and the holy Scripture it self (or Doctrine of Truth therein) cannot be broken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Husk,</hi> that intends no contempt upon the holy Scripture, but thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the meer Letter or Writing, it is not the <hi>Kernel,</hi> the seed, the <hi>Living Word, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> or <hi>Life</hi> which the Scriptures testifie of.</p>
            <p>Those Repeated Stories and Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons insinuated concerning <hi>Governments Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, Rulers Laws,</hi> &amp;c. pag. 4.5, 6, 7. Enviously and perversly Raked up by Patches, Mincings and piece-meal out of old Books, the most part writ in the <hi>Common-Wealth's</hi> Days, are plainly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, and our Innocency cleared in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral late Books, one Intituled, <hi>Christ's

            <p>All these Printed, and Sold by <hi>Thomas Northcot</hi> in <hi>George-Yard</hi> in <hi>Lumbard-street, London.</hi> So that much more time need not be spent to Answer the Libeller over again in these matters.</p>
            <p>As for outward or Civil <hi>Governments,</hi> our Peaceable and Christian Conversation, as a People, is so well known under all from first, that we need not fear secret Smiters and Libeller's unjust attempts to blast or cloud our Christian Reputation on that account, well knowing that when vve have suffered great wrong, and been sevearly persecuted by any in outvvard Povver for our tender Conscience tovvard God, he vvould be ready to Plead our Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Cause, as he hath many times done. And as for such Rulers or Persons in outvvard Povver, as have abused their power either by Injustice, Oppression or Persecution, they were all accountable to God, who is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specter of Persons; and for any of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to warn such against their Evil Ways, and of their Destruction or Overthrow,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106676:6"/>
when God requires them; this is so far from any act of Rebellion or Sedition, or unkindness either, that I think such kind of Pious Plainness and Caution seasonably given, is a token of the greatest Kindness can be expressed to the Great Men or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates of the Earth; though such Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is rarely well resented or accepted except by such Princes and Rulers whose Hearts are tenderly inclined, as was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s, <hi>Josiah</hi>'s, <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s, and such Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> &amp;c. as had some tender Fear to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and regard to his Laws in their Hearts.</p>
            <p>I do grant that several among our Friends at first and in the <hi>Common-Wealth's,</hi> days had no great affection to some sort of <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> and the more doubtful thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were Jealous that thereby, such Bishops would be set up again as would renew or cause Persecution upon Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious Dissenters again; For many of them came of <hi>Puritanical</hi> Families, who had deeply suffered by the former Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and their Courts (their Star-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and high Commission Court, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) This caused the greater Aversness (in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny heretofore) to such <hi>Monarchy</hi> thus considered; But what then? is it Just to upbraid us always as a People, and to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106676:6"/>

            <p>It's therefore a gross Slander implyed against the <hi>Quakers</hi> that 'tis their Boasting, Doctrine, or Principle that <hi>They or any of them are Equal with God,</hi> because they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of his Spirit that raised Jesus from the Dead (and of the divine Nature and Image) they pretend to no such Equality or Principle, neither doth G.

A. we could say more to it, to manifest and clear the Truth.</p>
            <p>To conclude this Point; 1<hi>st.</hi> I find not that the said <hi>Letter</hi> is directed and applied by <hi>John Audland</hi> himself unto <hi>G. Fox.</hi> 2<hi>dly,</hi> I do not approve thereof as cited and directed by our Adversaries (with the date of 1665.) unto G. F.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>John Audland</hi>'s Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and clearness in behalf of Jesus Christ, we have reason Charitably to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit his own Testimonies, rather than Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, or any thing his and our Adversaries enviously suggest, and turn or throw upon him (or us) to defame him and his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Reputation. Now they know he is gone, he is not here to answer for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, therefore his own Innocent undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Testimonies on Record shall speak for him (and his holy Respect and Honour as is only due to the very Christ of God) and against his Enemies. In behalf of Jesus

Christ, according to the Holy Scriptures; <hi>John Audland</hi> thus writes, <q>The Lord our Righteousness (by whose Grace we are saved) hath chosen us in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, who hath all Power and Authority committed unto him, and upon whose Shoulders the Government is laid, <hi>pag.</hi> 116.</q> Of the <hi>Collection of the Books and written Epistles of</hi> John Camm <hi>and</hi> John Audland.

               <p> Christ Jesus, since the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> hath perfectly fulfilled the Law of God, and there is Salvation in NO OTHER, <hi>pag.</hi> 117. <hi>ibid.</hi> Again, (of Christ) The true Shepherd laid down his Life for the Sheep, and he is the Door where no Thief can enter, &amp;c. <hi>pag.</hi> 120 Christ is not born by the will of man, <hi>pag.</hi> 122.

            <p>These Passages are (as many more might be) truly Collected out of <hi>John Audland</hi>'s Works and Writings to shew.</p>
