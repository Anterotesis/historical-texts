            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAd it not been long ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served that nothing is more resented by Great and Generous Princes, than the least Affronts to their Ministers, I should not have adventured to have addressed these <hi>Reflections (on the Earl of</hi> Castlehaven's <hi>Memoirs</hi>) to your Sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty; committed to the Press with an Introduction little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected:

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have so much Charity for the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven,</hi> that if he had seriously read, as well as (amongst the Stationers in Saint <hi>Paul's</hi> Church-yard,) took into his hands the Histories of the Execrable <hi>Irish Rebellion,</hi> begun the 23. of <hi>Octob. 1641.</hi> he would not (afterwards) have exposed his <hi>Memoirs;</hi> all the Imputations, which he lays on the State, being in them clearly vindicated. Yet
<pb facs="tcp:98070:4"/>
since (<hi>to draw from the World some Compassion</hi>) he hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured his Memoirs abroad, I am willing the World (to whom his Lordship appeals) should judge whether his Case was <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular?</hi> or being so premeditated, not more <hi>notorious?</hi> And <hi>this</hi> I thought sit to publish, resolving never to desert the <hi>English Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,</hi> as often as it is invaded, lest the confident Piece of Calumny fixed on the State, might wander secure and unexamined; there being at this day more, who, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Disguise, are willing to pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate, rather than detect the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany of that Age; though if you discourse on this Subject, they whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Intrigues, and if there be an
<pb facs="tcp:98070:4"/>
opportunity offered, they write they will verifie them to the World. Another being set on the Tragical Conclusion of the Long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (to make that <hi>Junto</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable) spends the <hi>viij.</hi> Chapter of his <hi>Short View of the late Troubles in</hi> England, wholly on the pretence the <hi>Irish</hi> had to their barbarous Insurrection: wherein he re-assumes the Rebels Plea, with greater Confidence, than they give it in at <hi>Trym March 17. 1642.</hi> But yet considers not the Answers that have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on that Rhapsodie of Fictions and Untruths; thereby betraying the Innocence of the State, and the Honour of the <hi>English.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is a <hi>Letter from a</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98070:5"/>
               <hi>Person of Honour in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to the Earl of</hi> Castlehaven, full of Candor, as well as Reproof, which hath incomparably well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Earl's Memoirs, and might well abate my edge in this Case. But upon the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Person of Honour (<hi>rather to quicken than slacken my Intentions</hi>) I could not well defer (what hath been long writ) the publishing my <hi>Reflections,</hi> (though with great disadvantage, after so excellent a Pen) they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meerly an Epitome of the <hi>Irish</hi> Scene. In which I have not (to my knowledge) discovered the least Emotion against the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry and Worth of that Noble Peer who hath raised this Contest,
<pb facs="tcp:98070:5"/>
his Extraction and Personal Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage being Remarkable. But the Reasons (for the Cause) he pretends to, are (by what he would justifie himself in) not sufferable; <hi>ou il n'ya point de pechè, il n'ya point de honte,</hi> his not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being convinced (at first) of the Crime, made him conscious of no Guilt. But I shall set the things in order before him, and if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction arise not thence, I shall blush at my mistake.</p>

            <head>REFLECTIONS ON THE <hi>Earl of</hi> CASTLEHAVEN'S MEMOIRS CONCERNING The WARS of IRELAND.</head>
            <p>AMongst some Books I lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from my Stationer I had the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven</hi>'s Memoirs.</p>
            <p>I little expected, after 28 years, to have seen any thing of his Lordship's Proceedings in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in taking part with the Rebels, before the Cessation 1643. considering his, and his Ancestors obligations to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> Nor am I convinced why (at this time) it should come forth, unless thereby its
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98070:7"/>
hoped that some Reflections may be fixed on the Ministers then to exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate the general Insurrection, when as we know no Artifice is more usual than to clamour the People with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies on the State, whilest others alarm them to Rebellion. I rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, since he imbarqued in that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness (<hi>in behalf of which his</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Majesties Message to the Parl. 14. <hi>Feb.</hi> 1641.</note> 
               <hi>late Majesties heart so often bled,</hi>) that the Act of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion should have sealed up those Encounters: especially since his Majesty had been prevailed with by the intercession of his Friends in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to repair the Breaches Time and Misfortune had made upon so ancient and honourable a Family as his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships. But since he hath published his Memoirs of his Engagements and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in the Wars of <hi>Ireland, as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them new, which</hi>

               <hi>if his Majesties time may permit him to read, contain neither Lie nor Mistake.</hi> I conceive him so inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous (having admitted others <hi>to mind</hi>

               <hi>him of some Passages which</hi>

               <hi>possibly may be more in their knowledge than his Lordships,</hi>) He will not interpret it amiss, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of some concerns nearer the Truth.</p>
            <p>It is not my intention to arraign what (as a Person of Honour and good Conduct) he managed in that War, having his Lordships Test for what he affirms. But that I may take his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs as they stand, he is pleased to write, (<hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 3.) <hi>That it may seem a wonder how he came to engage with the Irish, being a Peer of</hi> England, <hi>and an English man both by Birth and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent, not speaking a word of their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and having little in their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> Whereas the Wonder easily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riddles it self, his Lordship being a strong Asserter of the Romish Persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, to advance which, no Artifice or Attempt, hath ever been condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (by the Father of it) as Disloyal or Inhumane.</p>
            <p>And <hi>as to his Lordships coming into</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:98070:8"/>
Ireland <hi>not long before the Rebellion'</hi> (<hi>P.</hi> 5.) I cannot so far shrive his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, as not to allow what he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, <hi>That it was to settle his Affairs there, as he had done in</hi> England, <hi>ere he ventured further on the Trade of War, to which his Genius led him:</hi> Yet I find the Parliament (to whom the King had left the Affairs of <hi>Ireland</hi>) complain in an Order 29 of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1641. <q>That immediately before, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the barbarous and bloudy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, many having Estates in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, went thither,</hi>
               </q> amongst whom his Lordship was <hi>one</hi> especially taken notice of (in a Declaration of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons concerning the Rise of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion 25 of <hi>July</hi> 1643.) having sate as a Peer in Parliament in <hi>England</hi> immediately before the <hi>Irish</hi> Rebellion; at which time Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> Sir <hi>Basil Brook</hi> (the Queens Treasurer) Mr. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Brown,</hi> and others went over. And though his Lordships bare repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither may be more favourably censured, than to conclude, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98070:8"/>
to center in that Conspiracy; yet since he afterwards espoused that Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, when many (who having obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the bloudy Effects thereof) were ashamed (at least prudently deterred) to own its Progress, all cannot acquit him of that Taint, for that as an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Person in his Letter from the Country writes, (<hi>P.</hi> 50.) <q>That he could not have been engaged in that Conspiracy unless he had been resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Justice of their Cause from the beginning;</q> though he is put in mind (by the Letter he inserts) (<hi>P.</hi> 5.) <hi>That immediately upon the breaking forth of the Rebellion in the North, he (being in</hi> Munster) <hi>repaired to the Lords Justices, and (as his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors) offered to serve against the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, but was told his Religion was an Obstacle.</hi> Nor can I say but the State returned him this Answer, and how could they well say less? when it was apparent that it was a Popish Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, and those of that Profession were generally engaged in that Defection.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98070:9"/>
Though he must give me leave to put him in mind that the Lords Justices (how ill soever his Party would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent them to the World) were so far from owning a publick Jealousie of all of his Lordships persuasion, that it is well known they put Arms into the hands of divers Noblemen of the Pale of that Religion, who, (as his Lordship) made Professions to his Majesties Service, and desired the same. Nor was this Concession of the Lords Justices <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approved by the Parliament in England,</hi> they also gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">See the Kings Reply for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences for <hi>Ireland. Husb. Col. p.</hi> 72.</note> Commissions of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as likewise of Martial Law to several of the same Persuasion, not in the Pale onely, but in other parts of the Kingdom; inserting a Power <q>to spare or destroy the Rebels according to their discretion;</q> hoping those of the Pale might prove good Instruments to oppose the threatning Incursions of the Northern Rebels: whilest they a few days after deserted their Houses,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98070:9"/>
and openly declared themselves in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Rebellion; as did several of the principal Towns, <hi>Wexford, Waterford, Dundalk, Trym,</hi> and others, to whom the State had sent Arms and Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Trust. And <hi>this</hi> not through the least force put on them by the State: No, they yielded to whatsoever they thought might argue an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of them, but they of the Pale centered with the other through their Natural Inclination, and (as we may believe from the Lords <hi>Mac-Guire, Mac-Mahon, Mac-Arts,</hi> and others Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions) a designed Insurrection through the whole Kingdom of the Popish Persuasion, cherished by an inveterate detestation of the <hi>English,</hi> what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text soever else <hi>his Lordship</hi> (in an Appendix) promises <hi>We shall find the true Original Causes of the late Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion throughly discovered:</hi> A Piece speedily desired, that the Fallacy he presumes to cast before the King might be detected. So that something more than ordinary (though the Particulars

was his Resentment thereof so often to have been angerly exprest as <hi>a villainous proceeding against him. (P.</hi> 14.) An Expression unfit for such, (and not otherwise than with scorn to be resented) on whom his Majesty had impressed his Authority.</p>
            <p>What his Lordship did at home, besides spending his Provision on the Noble and Excellent Company he had there, the Dutchess of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> and Earl of <hi>Antrim</hi> (who afterwards sate Chairman at <hi>Kilkenny,</hi>

said) he refused to swear to, and it was not then justified to the contrary, though his intent of producing it there, was suspected to be in favour of them, that their proceedings might be the easier palliated, though the Oath was so weav'd, as Disloyalty and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction spun every thred.

Nor was this which they call Murther of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Husbandmen, any other than (upon Examination) found to be Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice on Rebels from whom the active Rebels had daily relief, amongst which there were two Protestants. The Sword once drawn, Legal Pleas are seldom heard, though I think his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship can hardly produce one Example where the State (being seasonably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) did not (as far as the time permitted) exert their Interest to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit the Innocent. The Discipline too of his Majesties Army was so well known, under the Conduct of so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable a Person (no enemy to them further than their Disloyalty justly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced him) and such worthy Officers, as few (who knew' them) will ever give credit to a report that shall blast
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98070:14"/>
them in that particular. Besides, it must be considered, that what cruel acts soever were done beyond the course of ordinary Justice, the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors must be put in mind that they were <hi>primi in culpa;</hi> and that the bloud in <hi>Drogheda</hi> and elsewhere shed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> lies at their Doors; for had they not raised and continued the Rebellion through his Lordships access (and other Officers from abroad) to their Party, in all probability a Sword to this day had not been drawn (at least continued) in that Kingdom; and the assurance of what Force that united Kingdom would<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to his Majesty, might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented all the effusion of bloud in <hi>England.</hi> Nay, so tender was the State of giving the least offence to any that under <hi>that pretence</hi> might skreen their Villany, as some exceptions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken by divers Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Pale, as if they should be involved in these words, <q>That some evil affected <hi>Irish</hi> Papists had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired.

&amp;c.</q> The Lords Justices and Council (to shew they intended thereby <q>onely such of the old mere <hi>Irish</hi> in the Province of <hi>Ulster,</hi> as were then Actors in that Treason, and others who adhered to them)</q> published the 29. of <hi>October,</hi> 1641. their sense thereof; which these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented Gentlemen seemed then to be satisfied with. Yet their hearts being bound up with the Rebels, it was not long before they suffered (or rather caused) the Recruit going for <hi>Drogheda</hi> the 29. of <hi>November,</hi> to be defeated at <hi>Gellingston Bridge,</hi> and within a few days after, the Lord <hi>Gormanston</hi> (with many more of the Lords and prime Gentry of the Pale) struck up an agreement with the Rebels at the Hill of <hi>Crofty,</hi> meeting afterwards at the Hill of <hi>Tarragh,</hi> where they produced an Answer to the Lords Justices Summons <hi>Decemb.</hi> 3. <q>to consult with them for the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Kingdom;</q> and that before ever the Northern Rebels (as they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards

alledged) forced them to a compliance, for want of a sufficient sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply from the State to resist them; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending they had no security for their safety.

Yet that the clearness of the States Intentions might further appear to wean all from any appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98070:16"/>
of suspicion of them, the Lords Justices at that time imbraced the seeming Application of the E. of <hi>Westmeath,</hi> Sir <hi>Morgan Cavenagh's</hi> feigned Protestations, and permitted Sir <hi>Luke Fitz Gerald, Robert Harpool</hi> Esquire, and others, (against whom they had more than ordinary proofs of their taking part with the first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators) peaceably to return to their habitations; as they did <hi>James War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,</hi> and <hi>Friar Paul Oneil</hi> (both exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the Council Board) and were not without reason suspected of the Rebels Party; which Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence they soon improved to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of the State, which (of 60 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons apprehended as justly suspected to be in the Plot) caused onely one of <hi>Fermanagh</hi> to suffer death, whom the Lord <hi>Mac-guire</hi> confessed to be privy to the Plot.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>As to the keeping back of Petitions from the King,</hi> by which his Lordship will have it, <hi>That the whole Nation took up Arms for their defence;</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:98070:16"/>
he must be put in mind <hi>(he taking plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to be minded of what is more in others knowledge than his,)</hi> that in the beginning of the Rebellion, the <hi>Irish</hi> had never less reason to complain that their Grievances were not presented; For the Commissioners of Parliament of <hi>Ireland,</hi> (*by whom the<note place="margin">The King's Works, <hi>Vol.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 569.</note> Rebellion was hatch'd) who had attended his Majesty with a Collection of all Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, were returned with such high and unexpected condescensions, and those especially relating to the Roman Catholicks, that it was but in <hi>August</hi> 1641. (being the last Sessions) thought that the next Sessions of Parliament would be principally to return his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty their acknowledgment, that (by taking off all Discriminations and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacities) he had laid a most sure foundation of Unity and Peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his Subjects.

Besides, the Lords Justices and Council did not conceal or debar any thing that ever came to them from the Confederates, though warrantably they might have done it; some things being so peremptory, that it was not for them to admit of (being the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative of his Majesty) and others of that ill consequence to the injured Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants as (without a Comment) could not (with their trust) be presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his Majesty. All or most of which Addresses (however accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with undutiful and irreverend ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions or overtures) were with the first opportunity presented to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties view or knowledge. About the 6. of <hi>November</hi> 1641. the Rebels of the County of <hi>Cavan</hi> sent their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous Propositions to the Lords
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98070:17"/>
Justices and Council, which with their Answer, they forthwith certified to the L.

About the tenth of the same Month the <hi>Longford</hi> Letter to the Lord <hi>Dillon</hi> of <hi>Costiloe,</hi> full of pretended Grievances and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Demands, as freedom of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, a Repeal of all Laws made to the contrary, and the like; was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the State in behalf of the Rebels of <hi>Longford;</hi> which having an answerable return, his Lordship and the Lord <hi>Taaff,</hi> went into <hi>England,</hi> promoting that which afterwards centered in a Cessation. About the midst of <hi>December</hi> 1641. Sir <hi>Thomas Carey</hi> and Dr. <hi>Cale</hi> a Sorbonist, offered to the Council Board several Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the Rebels, presuming (upon the straits that the State was brought to) that their insolent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands would not have been denied, which they were; but not without
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98070:18"/>
representing them to his Majesty. The 23. of <hi>December</hi> 1641. seven Lords of the Pale (who had declared by former Letters. <q>That they would stand on their Guard, after that they had joined with the Northern Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, in the Siege of <hi>Drogheda</hi>
               </q>) sent Letters to the Lords Justices, to which (though without prejudice to his Majesties Honour) they could not answer, yet they certified them to the Lord Lieutenant. And about the 16. of <hi>March</hi> 1641. there was an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verture made to the Lords Justices by a Letter to the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven,</hi> (who by his Memoirs gives us occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to reflect on these things) in the name of the United Lords of the Pale, signed by <hi>Gormanston, Netter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile</hi> and <hi>Slane,</hi> for a Cessation of Arms; after that (by his Majesties Forces transmitted out of <hi>England,</hi> and 10000 compleat fresh men in <hi>Ulster,</hi> besides the <hi>Scotch</hi> ten Regiments then in the Field) the <hi>Irish</hi> were beaten from <hi>Drogheda</hi> by Sir <hi>Henry Tichborn;</hi>

Such another Paper from the Lord <hi>Mountgarret</hi> the 23. of <hi>March</hi> 1642. came to the Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Lieutenant General of his Majesties Army, containing Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces done in <hi>England</hi> as well as <hi>Ireland,</hi> to shew to the Lords Justices, which lay not in their power to redress; which was also sent to the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant to be shewn to his Majesty. And in <hi>August</hi> the Confederates sent to the Lieutenant General a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion directed to his Majesty, which his Lordship presented to the Lords Justices, who forthwith sent it to his Majesties Principal Secretary; and thereupon a Commission was sent to the Marquess of <hi>Ormond</hi> 
               <q>to meet and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98070:19"/>
hear what the Rebels could say or propound for themselves;</q> by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of which, his Majesties Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners received the Rebels Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance at <hi>Trym, March</hi> 17. 1642. A mere Rhapsody of scandalous Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations upon the Government, and a justification of their Rebellion; since (1644.) fully answered by a Person then at the Helm, in a Book entituled, <q>
                  <hi>The false and scandalous Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance of the Inhumane and bloudy Rebels of Ireland,</hi>
               </q> worthy the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven</hi>'s further Information. This Remonstrance, at length, brought forth a Cessation, in hope (as <hi>David Routh,</hi> titular Bishop of <hi>Ossory</hi> insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) that it would at length prove the ruine of Heresie, and the firmer esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of the Catholick Faith and Interest. And in truth, whatsoever pretension there was for it, it proved a snare to the <hi>English,</hi> and no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to his Majesty. After which, their Agents were heard by his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty in <hi>Oxford,</hi> who at their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98070:19"/>
(amongst many excellent admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, worthy so intelligent a Prince) were advised, <q>That if they made haste to assist to suppress the <hi>English</hi> Rebellion, they might confidently believe he would never forget to whose Merit he owed his Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Restauration, and then it would be in his absolute power to vouchsafe such Graces to them as would not leave them disappointed of their just and full expectations.</q> Words sufficiently August. By which it is apparent, that nothing that ever the Rebels pretended should come to his Majesties Ears, was obstructed by the Lords Justices or State: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his Lordship is somewhat po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive, <hi>that the Rebels Petitions (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly those of the Pale) were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver sent to the King.</hi> Wherein he assumes the Bleeding <hi>Iphigenia's</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <q>That the <hi>Irish</hi> to<note place="margin">Decemb. 23. 1674.</note> this day were never heard to speak for themselves,</q> which (by what is before cited) is

And the 12. of the same, the Lords Justices and Council reprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an Order of the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> whereby they had power <q>to bestow his Majesties gracious Pardon to all such as within a convenient time (to be declared by the Governours of that Kingdom) should return to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98070:21"/>their due obedience,</q> which effected nothing on the Rebels. No more did his Majesties Gracious Proclamation of the first of <hi>January</hi> 1641. under his Royal Signature and Privy Signet, <q>commanding them to lay down Arms.</q> And when the Parliament met the 16. of <hi>November</hi> 1641. and there was a necessity to prorogue it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter two days, <q>by reason of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent state and condition wherein the Kingdom stood.</q> The Lords Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Council were so careful, that no Jealousies or Pretence should arise thence, <hi>as if his Majesty would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw any of his Acts of Grace,</hi> that they, by his Majesties directions, did make known to the Parliament, <q>That his Majesty would not depart from any his former Favours promised to them for setling their Estates, to such as should remain faithful and loyal.</q> Nay so desirous were the Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices and Council to draw off from that Combination the Lords and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the Pale, that <hi>Feb.</hi> 8. 1641. when
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98070:21"/>
they set Prices on the Rebels heads (to which they were authorized,) they never named the Lords of the Pale, and but few of the Gentry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Conspirators, though in an insolent and most prodigious manner they had acted with them. And when the Lords Justices imployed a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Parliament to them, they scornfully rejected them, tearing the Order of Parliament, and the Letter that accompanied them. Using no better the Lord <hi>Moore,</hi> and others ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to treat with them afterwards; Nor (at another time) some of their own Clergy, that if it had been possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they might have won them to Obedience. Yet further, so desirous was the State to compose all difference betwixt them and the Rebels, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sir <hi>Richard Barnewell</hi> and <hi>Patrick Barnewell</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr>, both of the County of <hi>Meath,</hi> had joined with the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Rebels, the State (upon their pretence, that if they might have a Commission to Parley with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98070:22"/>
they hoped to doe some good for the quiet of the Kingdom) granted them Commissions to that end; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it after appeared (by a very fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous and scornful return) that this was sought by them onely to gain some colour of security for their Rebellious complying with the Rebels, dealing thence most deceitfully in all things expected from the Lords Justices and Council. Could there be greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence than <hi>these</hi> of his Majesties Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours inclination to Peace and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? It is no wonder that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, to effect their Empire, should make their way through any calumny they can defame the State withall; that palliating their own Treachery, they might colourably charge the State. Whereas the <hi>Irish</hi> were so far from being provoked by the State, that no less a testimony than the Word of that great, just and wise Prince, King <hi>Charles</hi> I. is extant to Posterity. <q>That he did extremely detest the odious Rebellion which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98070:22"/>
the Recusants of <hi>Ireland</hi> had, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ground or colour, raised against him, his Crown and dignity.</q> And <hi>as for the Lords Justices and most of the Councils being of the Parliaments Persuasion,</hi> it is an imputation so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, that the World may be defied to evidence wherein they further a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed than to manage the War as it was left to the Parliament, taking their best measures from the King himself. And thus much I may add, that if exceptions were particularly taken against <hi>one</hi> of the Lords Justices, the Times being ticklish and apt (on misconstructions) to disgust some, the <hi>other</hi> (more than that he was his Collegue) was so far from being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted against, maugre whosoever hath the countenance to face his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty with the contrary; that he was instituted again with Sir <hi>Henry Tich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born</hi> in the Government. Nor to this day did ever any, save some Bigot in Popery and Rebellion, blast his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or actions; unless being reduced
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98070:23"/>
to little, for being a perfect English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he may be taxed with too much credulity to trust to Acts and Promises, when he might have secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Arrears out of the publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, then at his disposure, and yet not have tripled his Estate to what it was before the Rebellion.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>As to the Racking of Sir</hi> John Read: It doth not appear by whose Order it was done; nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently who was obliged to answer this Objection. But it is well known the said <hi>Read</hi> faltered much in the pretence of his business. Nor is it a thing to be wondered at, that one, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicious, and a Stranger, should be strictly examined in a time of general Conspiracy, the course being often u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for Discovery, though not for Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. But the Lord <hi>Castlehaven</hi> puts us in mind, (<hi>P.</hi> 12.) <hi>He was his Majesties sworn Servant, a Stranger to the Country, unengaged, and an Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witness of the Remonstrants Proceedings: That he was his Majesties sworn Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:98070:23"/>
may be likely by the Impost he had upon Butter, procured for him from the King by some chief men of the Society <q>as a <note n="*" place="margin">L'Estr. Hist. C. 1. f. 182.</note> Reward for his detestable Service in perverting a Minister and his Family to the Popish Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</q> in whose house in <hi>Long-Acre</hi> the Jesuits Plot (discovered by <hi>Andreas ab Habernfield,</hi> a Nobleman of <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi>) was contrived against the King and Kingdoms. By Nation he was a <hi>Scot,</hi> in Office a Secular Jesuite, Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Colonel to Sir <hi>Henry Bruce</hi> a Papist, in the Earl of <hi>Strafford's</hi> new raised Army of 8000 in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and (as his Lordship says) happily <hi>an Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witness of the Remonstrants Proceedings,</hi> therefore the more to be suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted being like to palliate that to the King, which he was privy to in so treacherous a manner. But we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not allow <hi>that he was unengaged,</hi> for that (as we have shewn) he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly interessed in an abominable Plot, and we never heard that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98070:24"/>
it since, and was of the same Faith with the Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, a <note n="*" place="margin">So termed in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment against Fa. <hi>Philips, Straff. Trial, f.</hi> 752.</note> Substitute of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites. All that could be wrung from him (though his Lordship will have it, that he carried a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance to the King to beg his pardon for what the Confederates had done) was that he had a Petition from a few particular persons about their own concern, not one word of a Remonstrance of Grievances. So as hence it is clear, the State ought not to be taxed for keeping back any Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions from the King. Neither could that, or his Lordships other pretences be any just motive to desert the State. It being more rational to have adhered to the King's Justice than (in defiance thereof) to fly to his declared Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>But the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven having taken his way towards the Mountains of</hi> Wickloe, <hi>he cared little for the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> that is, for his Majesties Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98070:24"/>
Nor was it a wonder, he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to associate himself with those who had renounced God and the King; <hi>and so hastning to</hi> Kilkenny <hi>in two or three days he joined with the Supreme Council of the Confederate Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, entering into their Oath of As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociation,</hi> by which all were bound to obey them, <hi>being persuaded thereto through the Love the Country bore him, and his Relation, in reference to his three Sisters married amongst them.</hi> Notwithstanding his Majesties Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation <hi>Jan.</hi> 1. 1641. Declaring <q>All adhering to those leud and wicked persons then in Rebellion in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be Rebels and Traitors against his Royal Person, and Enemies to his Royal Crown of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> Ordering them to be prosecuted with Fire and Sword, as Persons who (by their high Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty against him their lawful and undoubted King and Sovereign) had made themselves unworthy of any Mercy or Favour.</q> And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98070:25"/>
his late Majesties and his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments difference at that time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the siding of such a Person of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as his Lordship with the Rebels, brought in Question his Majesties countenancing of them, when in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting of them, the Royal Army every where succeeded to their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stizement. Yet in despite of this suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, his Majesties Proclamations, and the horrid Examples of Cruelty the Rebels had committed <hi>on the English in that Kingdom in a time of setled Peace, without the least occasion given,</hi> as his Lordship words it in his Epistle to the Reader, He swore to the <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of his Life and Estate, to assist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> prosecute and maintain their Associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> As to which Oath I shall not say much, it being elsewhere an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, and particularly well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented on in the Letter to the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven. (P.</hi> 50.) But I shall mind him of what the Act of Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (somewhat slightly spoken of by his Lordship) says, <q>That the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98070:25"/>
disowned and rejected his, and his Royal Father's undoubted Right to <hi>Ireland,</hi> even while they (in the outward form of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings) treacherously used their Majesties names; withall, impiously seeming by words and shews to swear unto that, which by the whole Series of their Deeds they denied.</q> So as whatsoever satisfaction his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship took in the Model of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or the pretence of their Oath (with which he was much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) this Act of Settlement must brand their Proceedings to Posterity. And since the E. of <hi>Castlehav.</hi> is so often plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to bring in the Marq. of <hi>Ormond</hi> as consulting with him, I cannot omit how his Excellency takes notice in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Loughreogh,</hi> that notwithstanding the Confederates continual Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Loyalty to his Majesty, and their sincerity and earnestness to advance his Service and Interest; they have continually by themselves and their known Instruments, practised the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98070:26"/>
direct contrary. Which considered I cannot <hi>think</hi> his being one of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Council, and General of the Horse under <hi>Preston</hi> (before the Ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation) could ever sublimate his Birth or Loyalty. For in imitation of Good the President is prefer'd, so is Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Evil worse than the President, and that yet worse, where there is more time for Deliberation. His Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship joined not with the Consederates in many Months after their Rebellion, when he saw a Design of setting up a Supreme Council, in opposition to his Majesties Authority; and was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the unpunish'd Villanies and Murthers by the Confederates.</p>
            <p>And now being seated in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Council, where he<note place="margin">Walsh s. 115.</note> made up the 25. <hi>with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to no Province, but the Kingdom in general;</hi> He observes:</p>
            <p>First, <hi>That if a Letter came to them written in</hi> Irish, <hi>it would be wondered at, and hardly could one be found to read it. (P.</hi> 23.) Thereby implying
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98070:26"/>
that the Council was composed meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of English, the worse to be liked, not having English spirits. But it is evident few or none (except himself) were other than excellently skill'd in the <hi>Irish.</hi> What else did <hi>Darcy, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi> the Lords <hi>Mountgarret</hi> and <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery,</hi> the rest of the Commissioners, their Archbishops of <hi>Dublin</hi> and <hi>Tuam,</hi> with <hi>Tirlogh O Neil</hi> do there? Every of which (besides all their Covents, of which there were several in <hi>Kilkenny</hi>) used it frequently as their Native Speech, ordering several of their Acts, sometimes in <hi>Irish</hi> as well as <hi>English,</hi> to be printed at <hi>Waterford</hi> by <hi>Thomas Bowrke,</hi> Printer to the Confederate Catholicks of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That they were not in Case to bring to Justice those that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun the Rebellion.</hi> What Justice he means, is not for me to divine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it is apparent that what those did, the Supreme Council countenanced; else they would not have moved by joint Council, lived on one publick Stock
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98070:27"/>
of Maintenance; nor had the victory of one been the victory of the other, which through the Scene was equally acknowledged.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, His Lordship observes, <hi>that he never saw any of them esteemed or advanced.</hi> I know not what he esteems Advancement, but I find in the General Assembly Sir <hi>Phelim O Neil, Tirlogh O Neil, Philip Mac Mulmore O Relie, Hubert Fox, Pierce Fitz-Gerald<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> John Bellew, John Stanley, James Flemming, Roger Moor,</hi> &amp;c. All men at first proscribed. And his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship tells us of <hi>Owen O Neil</hi> in the great and notable Assembly at <hi>Waterford.</hi> And were I well acquainted with the List of the Supreme Council, no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion but I might find some that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared first in Rebellion brooding there, as others to the end entertained as Generals and supreme Officers in their Army; than which, what can be more of Esteem, or of greater Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement?</p>
            <p>In the next place his Lordship takes
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98070:27"/>
notice <hi>of his good Fortune at</hi> Birrh, <hi>to begin with an action of charity. (P.</hi> 23.<hi>)</hi> And certainly the effect was good, but whether from a principle of right Charity (which proceeds from a love of God to his Creatures) or Policy, I shall not busie my self to conclude. But as the Case stood, his Majesties Army was so prosperous in all parts, as had any less been done (than what he undertook) the return would have certainly been very severe; though when the <hi>best</hi> he can pretend to is summed up at <hi>Birrh,</hi> it must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded he was fortunate in Disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty.</p>
            <p>It is not my intention to speak any thing of his Lordships Encounters (they are under consideration) his <note n="*" place="margin">P. 67.</note> success in appeasing Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinies, his <note n="⸫" place="margin">P. 87.</note> Counsels, and the <note n="†" place="margin">P. 73, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> Mercy he shewed to any, (with which he seems to be much satisfied;) no man doubts but his inbred Gallantry, Education and Experience (<hi>P.</hi> 115. 119.) in this and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98070:28"/>
other Wars (in which he had been long trained) led him to many At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, all could not be unfortunate, Policy as well as Arms being often prevalent. Though for that (<hi>P.</hi> 33.) wherein he succeeded against S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Charles Vauafor,</hi> so many miscarriages fell out to impede Sir <hi>Charles</hi>'s success, as the Encounter there rather resembled an Incursion than a Battel; and may pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel the great Generals Parties at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt at <hi>Fienagh,</hi> where the Horse being sent over to skirmish, the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> mingling with them on a sudden, the Foot could do nothing, but through fear to kill their own, left the Bridge, Castle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all free to the Enemy, (<hi>P.</hi> 46.) And for those who were killed after quarter given at <hi>Cloghlea</hi> Castle, the Act was so much resented by Sir <hi>Charles</hi> as (had he come off at the Pass his Lordship encountered him) the manager of that unsaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness had been no less severely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished than those his Lordship men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (<hi>P.</hi> 67.) who (contrary to the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98070:28"/>
Conditions given by his Men to the Castle, he hath forgotten the name of) were sadly used by his Souldiers, rifled, wounded, slain.</p>
            <p>Not long after this, it seems the Marquess of <hi>Ormond</hi>'s Letter came by a Trumpeter to the Supreme Council then at <hi>Ross, who was quickly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched with a slight Answer, (P.</hi> 35.) which the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven</hi> resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (on consultation with others) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the Supreme Council a Letter to his Excellency, <hi>That they had summoned a General Assembly, in order to acknowledge the King's gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious favour in naming him his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner to hear their Grievances and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress them.</hi> Which may be well looked on as a Reflection, how far he had deviated, and a respect to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency; whilest it cannot but lay a foul aspersion on the Supreme Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, who could be so insolent as <hi>to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch a slight Answer</hi> to his Majesties Condescentions. Though the 8. of <hi>July</hi> afterwards his Lordship joining
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98070:29"/>
with the said Supreme Council<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the insufferable Answer they sent to the States <note n="*" place="margin">See Hist: of the Execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Irish</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell: <hi>f.128.</hi>
               </note> Warrant for the Release of <hi>Synnot,</hi> can hardly be wiped off with a tolerable excuse.</p>
            <p>This Letter soon after brought on a Treaty, which ended in the Cessation at <hi>Sigginstown, Septemb.</hi> 15. 1643. till which was effected, all Parties (writes his Lordship, <hi>P.</hi> 36.<hi>) laboured to get into possession of what they could.</hi> This in the King's Party was very tolerable, but as to his (intending thereby to retain by force his Majesties Castles, to out his good Subjects of their Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to keep up their usurped Authority) was looked on as very unjust and insolent. Especially when his Majesties Commission of Grace (for a Cessation of Arms) was in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and his Prime Commissioner (near the place his Lordship besieged) imploying his Officers to procure ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Provisions for him. However the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven</hi> proceeded in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98070:29"/>
that manner to a Cessation, which in truth proved but a Stratagem to draw the <hi>English</hi> Forces out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that the Confederates might reign alone. After which his Lordship was chosen (by the General Assembly) <hi>Generalis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simo, (Owen O Neil</hi> being thereof dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed) of which and his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding afterwards (being that they see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med more to respect the King's Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs) I shall not say much, his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs having spoken sufficiently. And as to the Lord <hi>Inchiquin</hi>'s changing Parties, (which he often reflects on) his Lordship hath exprest his sense, though in justification of the Lord <hi>Inchiquin</hi> more need not be said than what he in his Letter to Colonel <hi>Jones June</hi> 23. 1649. there says for himself, <q>That he had changed the Party, not the Cause, bidding him make all things the same they were pretended, and he was the same he ever was.</q> But to proceed, The Lord <hi>Castlehaven</hi> writes, <hi>(P.</hi> 54, 56.<hi>) That he served not the Confederate Catholicks after</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:98070:30"/>
               <hi>the Service he had done them in his Expedition in</hi> Munster. Though he accounts it a kindness to have been consided in by them, whom we are able to make good, <q>did first assume, usurp and exercise the Power of Life and Death, make Peace and War, Levy and Coin Money, and did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Acts of Sovereign Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</q> concluding in that excellent Model of Government <hi>(P.</hi> 22.<hi>)</hi> he takes the freedom to commend, <q>That no Temporal Government or Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction should be assumed, kept or exercised within that Kingdom, or any Province thereof, than what is approved or instituted by their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Assembly.</q> Considering which, how his Lordship should account it a kindness to be entertained by such a Consederacy, being a Peer of <hi>England,</hi> and descended thence from an ancient Stock of Worth and Honour, I must confess I have not yet arrived at that Morality to understand it such. Though to complete this Government the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98070:30"/>
Lawyers were principal Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, making use of their Learning and Skill for subversion of Government and good Order, seasonably observed by the Person of Honour in his Letter to the E. of <hi>Castlehaven,</hi> and may (I hope) for the future be an <hi>item</hi> in the States admittance of such to the Bar. And his Lordship must pardon the shrewd Memory of the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>English,</hi> if they call to mind how (in so bloudy a Cause) he could join with the Confederates against such detestations of that Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, as his late Majesty signified al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in every Declaration and Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage; and is (in his present Majesties Declaration <hi>Novemb.</hi> 5.) remembred <q>as a hainous Rebellion, and unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Insurrection.</q> Which since the Receipt of the Letter from the Person of Honour, the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven</hi> is convinced, or (at least is content) to acknowledge in his Epistle to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (added since he published his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs) <hi>that it was a Rebellion all the Water of the Sea cannot wash off that</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:98070:31"/>
               <hi>Nation.</hi> But to help that, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is acquainted (in the Col. Letter <hi>P.</hi> 10.) <hi>That he was ordered to go to him, and use his endeavours to persuade him to hasten a Peace, for which (from the beginning of the War<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) his Lordship had always laboured:</hi> with respect doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to his Oath of Association, by which he was obliged not directly nor indirectly to do any Act prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the Cause he had undertook to maintain, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Exercise of the Roman Catholick Faith and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> throughout the Kingdom, and all that should engage therein. An Oath absolutely destructive to the <hi>English</hi> and their Interest. Certainly there is not any thing that bespeaks a Christian more than a Mind conciled to Truth and Union. But how those ends should meet in the Peace he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, was very unlikely, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Majesties Concessions to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers, the inestimable loss the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Protestants had suffered, and the Enquiry there ought to have been for
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98070:31"/>

But certain it is, <q>That all the Rebels Proceedings, and their Demands, however con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended to, were insolent Treason.</q> Besides the Lord Lieutenant was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famously used, forced out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the Parliament then sitting at <hi>Dublin,</hi> Registring it to Posterity,

               <q>That the <hi>Irish</hi> were an insolent and, upon all advantages, a perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and bloudy Enemy.</q> None accompanying his Excellency to <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> in his hazardous Retreat thithes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he and the Protestant Army were designed to be cut off by <hi>Owen O Neil,</hi> but the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven, (P.</hi> 75.) who, upon the Rebels block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of <hi>Dublin,</hi> advised the Lord Lieutenant, (<hi>P.</hi> 78.) <hi>rather to deliver it to the Parliament than the Rebels; for that when the King should have</hi> England <hi>he would have</hi> Ireland <hi>with it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which otherwise with the Nuncio and his Party might remain separate.</hi> A right Conclusion, and that (if it were his advice,) determined for the best. <note n="*" place="margin">The Marqs Letter to Col. <hi>Jones, March</hi> 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1649.</note> Sure it is, the Marquess of <hi>Ormond</hi> chose to capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with <hi>Jones</hi> and others imployed by the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Parliament, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up <hi>Dublin</hi> into their hands, and other places, for that he could no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hold them, rather than to suffer

            <p>Afterwards I find his Lordship for some time retired, in the interim the Lord <hi>Inchiquin,</hi> the Lord <hi>Taaff,</hi> and other considerable Persons united.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98070:33"/>
setling that Kingdom fully under his Majesties obedience, which none could blame the King to make, upon diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Conditions, <q>That he might get such a United Power of his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as might have been able (with Gods blessing) to have prevented that infamous and horrid Parricide which ensued.</q> Though generous souls would rather have adventured all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, than to have enhaunced their price on his Majesties necessities.

            </p>
            <p>It would take up more time than can be dispensed with (at present) to answer all that is here alledged.</p>
            <p>I cannot say but as many as his Lordship affirms may be lost of the <hi>Irish;</hi> but that they fell in maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98070:34"/>
of this Peace, he must give me leave to doubt: In as much as <hi>Owen O Neil,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Antrim,</hi> and all the Northern Rebels refused to submit thereunto. Whose assistance to the other Party he cannot forget, and on what grounds they became Mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> no more than <hi>that no Towns that the Confederates had but</hi> Kilkenny <hi>would receive a Garrison, (P.</hi> 42.) And I am confident it is not out of his memory what the Clergy did at <hi>Jamestown, August</hi> 12. 1650. two days after that they had sent the Bishop of <hi>Dromore</hi> and Doctor <hi>Kelly</hi> 
               <q>to persuade the Lord Lieutenant to leave the Kingdom, claiming there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a Power Paramount to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Authority,</q> seconding their Excommunication with daily affronts, searching for him at <hi>Galway</hi> as for a Criminal person, their Clergy deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to revoke their Excommunication, or to give assurance to him, or the Commissioners of Trust, for not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting the like for the future. The

               <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and yet 20000 lost their lives to maintain the Peace of 1648. This Noble Earls Memoirs furnish us with Actions of a notable and active Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, such as <hi>engaged his Souldiers in Judgment as well as Duty, (P.</hi> 136.) so as it may be expected with the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> General, that he knew every Souldier by his name, and therefore might the more particularly affirm that 20000 fell in maintainance of the Peace of 1648. Yet who shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Premises, and those who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards submitted, will believe some unites are wanting to complete his Arithmetick. It may be he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98070:35"/>
that Captain <hi>Stafford</hi> (a Roman Catholick) yielded up the Castle of <hi>Wexford</hi> unto <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and entered himself into his Service, by which there ensued a notable effusion of bloud. And I see it is out of his mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how a Party of the Confederates contracted with <hi>Ireton</hi> to give an Inlet for his Army into <hi>Limerick,</hi> by securing a Port for that purpose; when, at the same time, <hi>Hugh O Neil</hi> their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour opposed it. And though he hath not forgot how he hindered the General Assembly met at <hi>Loghreogh</hi> (upon the Marquess of <hi>Clanrickards</hi> entry on the Government) to agree with the Parliament; yet it cannot but be remembred, how unanimously they treated about it; so as what was prevented in the General, Parties af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards concluded severally. As <hi>May</hi> 12. 1652. all under the Earl of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meath</hi> and the Lord <hi>Muskery</hi> (with whom there were several Lords, Knights and Persons of Quality com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,) concluded an Agreement
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98070:35"/>
with the Parliament, though others dissented by reason that they could not have the like Conditions, not for any affection to the King's Cause, or in maintainance of the Peace, 1648. but by reason the bloudiness of their Crimes could never be absolved. This being the truth, how may it be said, <hi>That to the end they refused all Offers of Peace to the Parliament.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vind. Cath. p. 208.</note> 
               <hi>Non defuerunt</hi> (writes an Author of the Conspiracy) <hi>Catholici, proh pudor! maxime Paci &amp; Ormonio hactenus adversarii, qui hisce Cromwellii legibus sese subderent.</hi> More we might say, but the time wasts. However we cannot draw off till we have somewhat considered his Lordships Charge, (<hi>P.</hi> 81.) <hi>That since his Majesties happy Restauration, the Estates of such as maintained the Peace to the last, have been given away by the Acts of Settlement, some very few excepted.</hi> The bleeding <hi>Iphigenia</hi> (a leading man in the Supreme Council) first raised this Crie, <q>Wonders, writes

he, being done since his Majesties Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration, Rebels are made honest men, and honest men Rebels, by the King's Royal Pleasure.</q> Excellent language! and that, it seems, which is the sense of the principal Romanists at this day; else the late unfortunate Viscount <hi>Stafford</hi> would not so readily (as he is charged by the eloquent and judicious Lord Chancellor) have <q>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled his Majesty for misplacing his Bounty, and rewarding none but Traitors and Rebels.</q> Which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with what we have mentioned, may be reason sufficient to fix his Lordship a while <hi>here</hi> centering in Opinion. Not that I do deny, but hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily there were some (who after their first defection) faithfully performed what they promised (more out of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest than Duty,) and are not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to their expectations. Yet it is to be weighed, that the Peace was made with the Community, not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Persons, with the Collective Body of the <hi>Irish,</hi> not any dissenting
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98070:36"/>
Clergy: so as the Breach being almost General, Individuals could not have the benefit thereof. Nor hath the Act of Settlement declared any Estates forfeited for fighting for his Majesty, but for being guilty of the horridst Rebellion History ever recorded. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth his Majesty give any part of such forfeited Estates as a Reward to any for fighting against him, as if thereby <q>from being Rebels they were made honest men:</q> But thereby he is graciously pleased to continue and confirm the Estates in the hands of his Protestant Subjects, formerly possessed thereof as Adventurers or Souldiers, redeeming their Errour of a Temporal Defection by arresting the first Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, (without consulting the success thereof, or capitulating with their Swords in their hands, as did the <hi>Irish</hi>) to hazard their lives for his Majesties Restauration: so as it seems somewhat harsh, to say, <hi>That the Estates of some few onely were exempted,</hi> when his Majesty in his gracious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98070:37"/>
for the Settlement of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, November</hi> 30. 1660. saith, <q>We cannot doubt but that all who have merited from us, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that we have been so far from being failing to them, that we have as well provided for them, as after so great troubles and confusions, and after such blessed circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our Restauration, they could reasonably expect.</q> And it is clear by the Act pursuant to that Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that the most eminent and considerable Persons (even such as soon after those who began the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in the North) who took up Arms, summoned, by the Intrusion of the Clergy, <hi>a general Congregation,</hi> they by a packed Party of bloudy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists in Rebellion and Confederacy, <hi>a General Assembly,</hi> those <hi>a Supreme Council</hi> concurring with the malice and hatred of the former, who neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated his Majesty to a Cessation, fetch'd in the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> abjured both Peaces, confederated with the Clergy,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98070:37"/>
kept the Lord Lieutenant out of the principal Towns, and twice forced him out of the Kingdom, who was their Asylum, their Advocate, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionately designing excellent things for them, though with great hardship and damage to the <hi>English.</hi> These afterwards ascribing all his Actions, his Counsels, how provident, how sincere soever, <hi>foedae Proditioni,</hi> (writes <hi>Vind. Cath. p.</hi> 223.) whilest he suffered much calumny for his desire of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving many of them that fell into his hands, as some of the Assembly could witness, who were by his means preserved, and might testifie as much: Treating however with Foreigners for Aid and Protection, are restored in Bloud and Estate, not respecting a Condition in that Act, <q>That such as entered into the Roman Catholick Confederacy at any time before the Articles of Peace 1648. should not be restored <hi>as innocent Papists.</hi>

And are these with his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship onely a <hi>few?</hi> When his Majesty had a <hi>Prospect</hi> of his Return for <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> he was so condescending (as having notice that <hi>Edmund Reily</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Armagh</hi> had attempted to instigate the Male contents against his coming in, promising to that end great assistance from a conjunction of the stronger Part of the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick <hi>Irish</hi>) that he had <hi>Don Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phano de Gameno</hi> (then Spanish Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador with the States) spoken to, that by a Command from <hi>Rome,</hi> the said <hi>Reily</hi> might be revoked imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> else he should be put to the <hi>Stress</hi> of signing a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for his Execution.

            <p>The Earl of <hi>Castlehaven</hi> having been retired, for some <hi>difficulties concerning</hi>

               <hi>Command, (P.</hi> 96.) is now joined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with the Army before <hi>Dublin,</hi> quartering near <hi>Rathmines,</hi> the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of which, his Lordship <hi>not being in chief Command, (P.</hi> 136.) I shall not mention; <hi>no Army or Party of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my being ever beaten so by an Enemy as to lose their ground to the end of the Fight where he commanded in Chief:</hi> yet his Excellency had many gallant Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons with him; and this Lord was designed a particular Post, which he does not tell us how he quitted. However, <q>the blame is not always to be fixed where it may most just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be <hi>placed.</hi>
               </q> Nor if the Lord <hi>Inchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi> had not gone into <hi>Munster</hi> with the 1100 Horse, as he was ordered to do at a Council of War <note n="*" place="margin">See the M. of <hi>Ormond</hi>'s Letter to <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghreog. f.</hi> 110.</note>, who is here <note n="†" place="margin">97.</note> and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where <note n="‖" place="margin">63, 64, 83, 84, 97, 98, &amp;c.</note> reflected on as if it had been a particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his own, could the Contingencies of that day have been secured, <hi>all the Gallantry</hi> that was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98070:39"/>
shewed, being not sufficient to redeem the misfortune (I will not say the miscarriage) of that day which in time brought on the Earl of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> to be Deputy, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> (writes his Lordship, <hi>P.</hi> 116,) <hi>no more than a Spectator;</hi> whereas in <hi>November</hi> 1646. he was made Lieut.

            <p>Hence the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord Lieutenants retreat into <hi>France,</hi> made a Noble Figure in the following War, though it is observed, <q>not without severity and fierce Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of the <hi>English.</hi>
               </q> And it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be said, (<hi>P.</hi> 112.) that (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Excellencies command) <hi>he kept a bussle as long as he could,</hi> and seasonably opposed the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>'s Agent, (<hi>P.</hi> 125.) <hi>hating to buy a supply so dear, as to give footing, or colour of pretence, or title to any foreign Prince, on hopes of succour thence.</hi> Which redounds much to his honour,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98070:39"/>
though the Abbot of St. <hi>Katherines</hi> did land, and by the Confederates (met at <hi>Galway</hi>) was treated with, without the privity of the Deputy who was not far from them. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards not being able to bussle further, his Lordship, the L. <hi>Castlehav. (P.</hi> 124.) was dispatched into <hi>France</hi> for Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, which failing he procured, the Lord Deputy his Majesties Letter <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging his good Service, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that he should make the best Conditions for himself and Party, that he could.</hi> Which was the last of the Earl of <hi>Castlehaven</hi>'s Imployments; but remains a standing honour to his Lordship, and a Justice due to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess of <hi>Clanrickard</hi>'s Merits.</p>
