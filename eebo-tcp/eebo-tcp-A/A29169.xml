         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<q>
                        <p>To the Honour of God and Holy Church, and of our Lord the King, for the Profit of him and his Realm, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Peace amongſt his People and the Eſtate of the Crown, the Prelates, Earls, Barons, and other Peers of the Land and Communes of the Realm, do ſhew againſt Sir <hi>Hugh le Deſpenſer,</hi> Father and Son, That whereas Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> the Son at the Parlement at <hi>York</hi>

                           </note> was Named, and it was there Agreed he ſhould be Chamberlain to the King; in which Parlement it was Agreed, That certain Prelates and other Great Men ſhould be with the King by turns, at ſeveral Seaſons of the Year, the better to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> him, without whom no great Buſineſs ought to paſs. The ſaid Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> the Son, drawing to him his Father, who was not by Order of Parlement to be near the King, or to be one of thoſe Counſellors, between them both have uſurped Royal Power over the King and his Miniſters, and the Government of the Kingdom, to the Diſhonour of the King, the Injury of the Crown, and Deſtruction of the Kingdom, Great Men, and People; and have done the Wickedneſſes under-written, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> contriving to turn the Heart of the King from the Peers of the Land, that they may have the ſole Government there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                        <p>1. That Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> the Son made a Bill or Writing, whereby he would have had Sir <hi>John Gifford</hi> of <hi>Brimmesfield,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard de Greye,</hi> and others, entred into a Confederacy to have forced the King to do what he would have him; and had almoſt done <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> it. The Tenour of the Bill is under written.</p>
                        <p>2. Homage and the Oath of Allegiance is more by reaſon of the Crown than of the Perſon of the King, and bound him more to the Crown than the Perſon; and this appeared, for that before the Crown deſcends, there is is no Allegiance due
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51901:67"/> to the Perſon Expectant. Wherefore in caſe the King carries not himſelf by Reaſon, in Right of the Crown, his Lieges are bound by Oath made to the Crown to remove the King and the State of the Crown by Reaſon; and otherwiſe the Oath ought not to be kept. Then it was demanded, whether the King was to be dealt with by Suit of Law, or by Rigour (<hi>par Suit de Loy ou par Aſpertee;</hi>) By Suit of Law it could not be, for he had no Judge. In which caſe, if the King's will be not according to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Reaſon, and that he maintains nothing but Errour; therefore to ſave their Oath, and when the King will not redreſs what is injurious to the People, they muſt proceed with Rigour; for he is bound by Oath to Govern his Lieges, and his Lieges are bound to Govern in Aid of him, and in Default of him.</p>
                        <p>3. Alſo upon the Application of the Great Men and People <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> unto him, his Anſwer was according to the Pleaſure of theſe Two, in turning the King from his Duty againſt his Oath, and the Hearts of the Great Men and People againſt their Liege Lord.</p>
                        <p>4. Alſo by their evil Contrivance, they will not ſuffer the Great Men of the Realm nor Good Counſellers to ſpeak with, or come near the King to adviſe him, nor the King to ſpeak <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to them, unleſs in their preſence and hearing, or of one of them, and when they pleaſe; they uſurping Royal Power and Sovereignty over the Perſon of the King, to the great Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Peril of him, the Crown, and the Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>5. Alſo to attain to their Wickedneſs, Covetouſneſs, and Diſinheriting the Great Men, and Deſtruction of the People, they put out Good and Agreeable Miniſters placed by Aſſent, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and put in others Falſe and Wicked of their Party, who will not ſuffer Right to be done as Sheriffs, Eſcheators, Conſtables of Caſtles, and make Juſtices not underſtanding the Law, as Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> the Father, Sir <hi>Ralph Baſſet,</hi> Sir <hi>Ralph Camois,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Inge,</hi> and others their Friends; who cauſed to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, by falſe Jurors of their Alliance, the Peers of the Land, as the Earl of <hi>Hereford,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Giffard</hi> of <hi>Brimmesfield,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Robert de Monſhall,</hi> and other good People, to get their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Lands.</p>
                        <p>6. Alſo they falſly and maliciouſly adviſed the King to raiſe Arms againſt his People in <hi>Gloceſterſhire,</hi> contrary to the Great Charter, and the Award of the Peers of the Land, and by their falſe and evil Counſel, would have made War in the Land for their own proper Quarrel, to the Deſtruction of Holy Church and the People. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> 
                        </p>
                        <p>7. Alſo whereas the Earl of <hi>Hereford,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Wigmore (i. e.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51901:67"/> himſelf into the Lords hands to the King's Grace and Pleaſure, and upon that Condition delivered him to the King, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him accordingly; but when theſe Lords were out of the Country, theſe Two, the Father and Son, uſurping Royal Power, took <hi>Lhewelin,</hi> and carried him to <hi>Cardiff,</hi> after that Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> the Younger was ſeized thereof (as of his Share of the Earl of <hi>Gloceſter</hi>'s Eſtate, one of whoſe Daughters and Heirs he had married) pretending to a Juriſdiction, where none was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in this caſe; and there cauſed him to be Drawn, Hanged, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, and Quartered, feloniouſly for things done in the time of King <hi>Henry:</hi> And alſo took upon them Royal Power and Juriſdiction, which was appendant to the Crown, in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Crown, and Diſhonour of the King, the ſaid Lords of <hi>Hereford</hi> and <hi>Mortimer,</hi> and in ill Example and great Peril in the like caſe in time to come.</p>
                        <p>8. Alſo they ill adviſed the King to take into his hands the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Lands and Goods of Sir <hi>Hugh Audely</hi> the Son, who was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged without due Proceſs, contrary to the Law of the Land, by the Covetouſneſs of the ſaid <hi>Hugh</hi> to get ſome of thoſe Lands; and by other falſe Compaſſments contrived to have the Lands of Sir <hi>Roger Dammory,</hi> and for having him attainted for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into <hi>Gloceſterſhire,</hi> in Diſheritance of the Peers of the Land. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                        </p>
                        <p>9. Alſo that whereas the King had granted by his Letters Patents to the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> in full Parlement at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> That after his Death his Executors ſhould have his Lands until his Heir was of Age; which Grant, after the Earl's Death, was confirmed by the King at <hi>Lincoln,</hi> at the Requeſt and Aſſent of the Peers of the Land in Parlement, the ſaid Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> the Father procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Son to cauſe the King to repeal this Grant without cauſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and to give to the ſaid <hi>Hugh</hi> the Father, for his own Profit, the Guard of thoſe Lands; and alſo had defeated by evil Counſel what the King had granted in his Parlements by good Advice, and by Aſſent of the Peers of the Land, to the Diſhonour of the King, and againſt Right and Reaſon.</p>
                        <p>10. Alſo, that they would not ſuffer the King to take reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Fines of the Peers of the Land and others, when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and received their Fees, as it had been uſed before that time: But by Covetouſneſs, to get ſuch Lands by the Royal Power they had gained, they cauſed undue Impeachments to be brought, ſurmiſing the Land was forfeit, as of Sir <hi>John de Mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray</hi> for the Lands of <hi>Gower,</hi> and of others, to the Damage and Diſhonour of the King, and contrary to the Law of the Land, in Diſheritance of the Great Men and others.

                     <p>Alſo it is to be thought on, That no Man in the World, who loved <hi>God, Holy Church,</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> but had great Reaſon to think Sorrowfully of things, and Weep, That the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that was wont to be the Fountain, Root, and Source of Sanctity, and Deſtruction of Covetouſneſs, Simony, and other Sins, had ſo craftily, by little and little, more and more in proceſs of time, gained the <hi>Collations</hi> of <hi>Biſhopricks, Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Prebendaries, and other Benefices of Holy Church in <hi>England,</hi> of which the <hi>Pope</hi> always received the Tax or Firſt Fruits, and by his <hi>Bulls</hi> made ſeveral Tranſlations that he might get the more, by which Means, and by other Payments, and Charges, the <hi>Biſhops</hi> became ſo much in <hi>Debt</hi> to the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they ſold the <hi>Timber</hi> of their <hi>Biſhopricks,</hi> had Ayd of their Poor Tenants, and the Clergy, and all Methods were taken, to deſtroy the Church, and Realm of <hi>England.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo it ought to be thought on, That there are many, that when they have purchaſed one Benefice of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and payed the Tax or Firſt-fruits, and the Brokers of Benefices reſiding in the Wicked City of <hi>Avinion,</hi> (<hi>en la pechere uſe Cite D'Avenon</hi>) they let them to Farm, and ſend the Rents to their Brokers to purchaſe more and greater Benefices, even as a <hi>Caitif</hi>

And for the ſame cauſe People forbear to put their Children to School; ſo as the Clergy fails, which is the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Church, and our Holy Faith declines, and comes to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> nothing.</p>
                     <p>Alſo it ought to be thought on, That <hi>Strangers,</hi> Enemies to this Land, and others beyond Sea, have Benefices, Riches, and Rents of Holy Church in <hi>England,</hi> which never ſaw, or will ſee their Pariſhioners, whereby the Service of God and Holy Church, and all Works of Charity are neglected, the Pariſhioners like to ſuffer in Body and Soul, their only care being to get the Profits of their Benefices out of the Kingdom: And ſo it is that Holy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Church is more deſtroyed by ſuch wicked Chriſtians, than by <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo it is to be thought on, That the Law of Holy Church is ſuch, that the Benefices of Holy Church ought to be given freely out of pure Charity, without Price or Prayer, without the Gift of Gold, Silver, or any thing elſe: And that Law and Reaſon will, that what is given by Devotion to Holy Church, ought to be ſpent to the Honour of God, according to the Devotion and Intent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the Donour, and not out of the Realm upon their Enemies.</p>
                     <p>Alſo it is to be conſidered, That God committed his Sheep to the <hi>Pope</hi> to Paſture, and not to Shear them; and that the Lay Patrons followed theſe Examples, and ſold their Churches as God was ſold to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who put him to Death.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore they deſired the King would pleaſe to obſerve this was the 50th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Year of his Reign, which was called the <hi>Year of Jubilee,</hi> the Year of Grace and Joy, and it would be the greateſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Grace and Joy that ever happened to this Kingdom, and the moſt pleaſing to God and Holy Church, and all thoſe that love them; if the things above-ſaid were laid to heart, and agreeable Remedy provided for them.

                     <p>The <hi>King</hi>'s Anſwer was, That he had ordained ſufficient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> before, by Statutes and otherwiſe, that he was then apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, and preſſing the <hi>Pope</hi> concerning this matter, and was fully reſolved to do it from time to time, until he had perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Deſires, as well concerning the things compriſed in this large Bill next foregoing, as that which was to follow, which was very near the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The Title of this Bill in the Todding, or in the Margin of the Parlement-Roll, is, <hi>(Bill encontre le Pape, &amp; le Cardinaux)</hi> The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Bill againſt the Pope and Cardinals; and the other, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows this on the Roll, and was almoſt the ſame, had this Title: The Bill and Articles againſt the Pope and Clergy; <hi>(Billes &amp; Articles encontre le Pape, &amp; le Clergy.)</hi> To both which the <hi>King</hi> anſwered as above.</p>

Alſo, whereas by the Great Charter, and other good Laws and Uſages of the Kingdom, no Man ought to be taken, put in Priſon, or to Death, without due Proceſs of Law, the fore ſaid <hi>Nich.

                     <p>XIV. Alſo theſe Five cauſed ſome Lords and others Loyal Lieges to be put out of the King's Council, and ſo as they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> dare not ſpeak in Parlement about the good Government of the King's Perſon or Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>XV. Alſo, whereas in the laſt Parlement all the Lords, Sages, and Commons there aſſembled, ſeeing the imminent Ruin of the King and Kingdom, by the Perils and Miſchiefs aforeſaid, and for that the King had forſaken the Counſel of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and holden himſelf altogether to the Counſel of the ſaid Five Evil-doers and Traitors; and alſo for that the King of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                        <hi>France</hi> with his Royal Power was Shipped at Sea, ready to have Landed in <hi>England,</hi> to have deſtroyed the Kingdom and Language thereof; and there was no Ordinance then made, or Care taken for the Safety of the King and Kingdom; They knew no other Remedy than to ſhew the King fully how he was ill Governed, Led, and Counſelled, by the Traitors and Ill-doers aforeſaid; requiring him moſt humbly as his Loyal Lieges, for the Safety of him and his whole Realm, and to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> avoid the Perils aforeſaid, to remove from his Preſence the ſaid Evil-doers and Traitors, and not to do any thing after their Advice, but according to the Counſel of the Loyal and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Sages of the Realm: And hereupon the ſaid Traitors and Evil-doers, ſeeing the Good and Honourable Opinion of the Parlement, to undo this Good Purpoſe, by their falſe Counſel cauſed the King to Command the Major of <hi>London</hi> to kill and put to death all the ſaid Lords and Commons, except ſuch as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> were of their Party; to the doing whereof, theſe great Traitors and Evil-doers ſhould have been Parties, and preſent, in undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King and Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>XVI. Alſo, That thoſe Five Traitors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when the Major and Good People of <hi>London</hi> utterly refuſed, in the Preſence of the King, to Murder the Lords and Commons, by their ſaid
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:51901:188"/> Traiterous Accroachment, falſly Counſelled the King, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with him to leave the Parlement for many Days; and cauſed him to certifie <hi>(&amp; fiſt certifier)</hi> That he would not come to the Parlement, nor Treat with the Lords and Commons of the Buſineſs of the Kingdom, for any Peril, Ruin, or Miſchief that might happen any ways to him or the Realm, if he were not firſt aſſured, by the Lords and Commons, that they would not ſpeak or do in that Parlement againſt any of the Miſdoers, ſaving <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that they might proceed on in the Proceſs which was then commenced againſt Sir <hi>Michael de la Pole;</hi> to the great Ruin of the King and Kingdom, againſt the ancient Ordinances and Liberties of Parlement.</p>
                     <p>XVII. Alſo the ſaid Lords and Commons, after they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the King's Mind, by the wicked Excitation and Counſel of the Five, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was ſuch, as he would not ſuffer any thing to be commenced, purſued, or done, againſt the ſaid Miſ- or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Evil-doers <hi>(mesfeſours)</hi> they dare not ſpeak or proceed againſt the King's Will; and then in Parlement was read the Counſel and Advice of the Lords and Juſtices, and other Sages and Commons of Parlement, how the Eſtate of the King and his Royalty might be beſt ſaved, againſt the Perils and Miſchiefs aforeſaid, and they knew not how to find any other Remedy than to ordain, That Twelve Loyal Lords of the Land ſhould be the King's Council for One Year; and that there ſhould be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> made ſuch a Commiſſion and Statute, by which they ſhould have full and ſufficient Power to Ordain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the Effect of the Commiſſion and Statute; by which Commiſſion and Statute, no Man was to Adviſe the King againſt them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Forfeiture, for the firſt Offence, of his Goods and Chattels; for the ſecond Offence, Life and Member: Which Ordinances, Statute and Commiſſion were made agreeable to the Aſſent of the King, the Lords, Juſtices, and other Sages and Commons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> aſſembled in the ſaid Parlement, to ſave the King, his Royalty and Realm: The ſaid Traitors and Miſdoers, by their Evil, Falſe, and Traiterous Informations of the King, that the ſaid Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, Statute, and Commiſſion were made to Defeat his Royalty; and that all thoſe who procured and counſelled the making of them, and thoſe who excited the King to Conſent to them, were worthy to be done to Death as Traitors to the King. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                     </p>
                     <p>XVIII. Alſo, after this, the ſaid Five Miſdoers and Traitors, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the King to aſſemble a Council of certain Lords, Juſtices, and others, many times without the Aſſent and Preſence of the Lords of the Great Council; and made divers Demands of them very ſuſpicious, of divers Matters; by which the King, Lords, and Common People were in great Trouble, and the whole Realm alſo.</p>
                     <p>XIX. Alſo to accompliſh the ſaid High Treaſon, the Miſdoers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and Traitors, <hi>Alexander, &amp;c. Robert, &amp;c. Michael, &amp;c.</hi> by the Aſſent and Counſel of <hi>Robert Treſilian,</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Brembre,</hi> cauſed the King to go through the Kingdom with ſome of them, and into <hi>Wales,</hi> and cauſed him to make come before him the Lords, Knights, and Eſquires, and other good People of thoſe Parts, as well of Cities and Burghs, as other Places; and made ſome to

                     </p>
                     <p>XX. Alſo by force of ſuch Bonds and Oaths, all the Realm was put into great Trouble by the ſaid Evil-doers and Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and in peril to have ſuffered many importable Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs.</p>
                     <p>XXI. Alſo, to bring about their Traiterous Purpoſes, the ſaid Five cauſed the King to go into ſeveral Parts of the Kingdom for ſome long times, whereby the Lords aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by the ſaid Ordinance, Statute, and Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> could not Adviſe with him about the Buſineſs of the Kingdom; ſo as the Purport and Effect of the Ordinance, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, and Commiſſion, were Defeated, to the great Ruin of the King and Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>XXII. Alſo the ſaid <hi>Robert de Vere Duke</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by the Counſel and Abet of the other Four Traitors, accroaching to himſelf Royal Power, without the King's Commiſſion, or other ſufficient uſual Warrant, made himſelf Juſtice of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> by himſelf and Deputies held all manner of Pleas, as well Common, as of the Crown, and gave Judgments upon them, and made Execution thereof; and alſo cauſed many Original and Judicial Writs to be ſealed with the Great Seal uſed in thoſe Parts: And alſo by ſuch Accroachment of Royal Power, he cauſed to riſe with him a great Part of the People of that Country, ſome by Threats, others by Impriſonments of their Bodies; ſome by ſeizing of their Lands; others by many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Diſhoneſt Ways by colour of the ſaid Office; and all this, to make War upon, and deſtroy the Lords, and other the King's Loyal Lieges, in undoing the King and whole Realm.</p>
                     <p>XXIII. Alſo the ſaid Traitors <hi>Robert de Vere, &amp;c. Alexander, &amp;c. Michael, &amp;c.</hi> by the Counſel and Abet of <hi>Robert Treſilian</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Brembre,</hi> incroaching to themſelves Royal Power, cauſed to be delivered <hi>John de Blois</hi> Heir of <hi>Britan,</hi> who was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Priſoner and Security to the King and Kingdom, without Aſſent of Parlement and the King's Great Council, and without War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, to the great Strengthening of the Adverſary of <hi>France,</hi> the great Ruin of the King and Realm, and againſt the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and Ordinances aforeſaid, made in the laſt Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

Alſo, the ſaid Five Traytors cauſed the King to have a great Retinue of late, of divers People to whom he gave <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Badges, which was not done in ancient time by any Kings his Progenitors, that he might have Power to perform their falſe Treaſon aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>XXV. Alſo the aforeſaid Five Miſdoers and Traytors, in full accompliſhment of all their Treaſons aforeſaid, and to make the King give Credit to them and their Counſel, and hold

                              <p>21. The ſame King, <note n="3" place="margin">Ibm. n. 38.</note> that he might ſupplant his People, and get their Eſtates to enrich himſelf, cauſed the People of Sixteen Counties, by Letters under their Seals, to ſubmit to him as Traitors; by colour of which, he obtained of them great Sums of Money to procure his Favour: And although <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to pleaſe the People thoſe Letters Obligatory were reſtored to them; yet their Procurators had full Power to bind themſelves for them to the King, which he cauſed to be done; and ſo deceived his People, and ſubtilly extorted their Goods from them.</p>
                              <p>22. Although the ſame King <note n="4" place="margin">Ibm. n. 39.</note> Sware at his Coronation to Preſerve the Liberties granted to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> yet by reaſon of his Voyage into <hi>Ireland,</hi> he by his Letters <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Commanded many Religious Perſons, Abbats and Priors, ſome to ſend him Horſes, others Waggons, others great Sums of Money; and by his way of Writing, he forced many by Fear to comply with his Demands; whence they were impoveriſhed and oppreſſed, in manifeſt derogation to Eccleſiaſtic Liberty; by which Pretext he incurred Perjury.</p>

                              <p>25. He was ſo Variable <note n="7" place="margin">Ibm. n. 42.</note> and Diſſembling in Words and Writing, and ſo Contrary to himſelf, ſpecially in Writing to the <hi>Pope, Kings,</hi> and other <hi>Lords,</hi> without and within the Kingdom, and alſo to his Subjects, that no Man living, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he was, could confide in him; yea, he was reputed ſo Unfaithful and Inconſtant, that he was not only a Scandal <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to his own Perſon, but to the whole Kingdom, and all Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that knew him.</p>
                              <p>26. Though the Lands, Tenements, <note n="8" place="margin">Ibm. n. 43.</note> Goods and Chattels of all Free-men, by the Laws of the Land, ought not to be ſeized without Forfeiture; yet the ſaid King intending to ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate thoſe Laws, in the Preſence of many Lords and others of the Community of the Kingdom, he often ſaid and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, That the Life of every Subject, his Lands, Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Goods, and Chattels were his, to be diſpoſed as he pleaſed without Forfeiture; which was altogether againſt the Laws and Cuſtoms of his Kingdom.</p>

By which Article it appears evidently, That the ſame King endeavoured pertinaciouſly to maintain thoſe Statutes and Ordinances, which were Erroneous,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:51901:216"/> Wicked, and Repugnant to all Law and Reaſon, not only in his Life, but after he was Dead, neither regarding the Danger of his Soul, or the utmoſt Deſtruction of his Kingdom or Liege People.</p>

Further, the King intending to palliate his inconſtancy, by flattering Words endeavoured to caſt the Injury done him upon others: Whence the Arch-Biſhop having Diſcourſe with the King, the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> other Lords, and Great Men, lamenting ſaid, He was not the firſt had been Baniſhed, nor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſhould be the laſt, for that he thought within a ſhort time the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and other Lords, would follow him; and conſtantly told the King, That the Conſequences of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes would fall upon his own Head at laſt; To which the King, as if he had been aſtoniſhed, preſently anſwered, he thought it might ſo happen, he might be expelled his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by his Subjects; and further ſaid, if it ſhould be ſo, he would go to the Place where he was; and that the Arch-Biſhop <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> might believe him, he ſhewed him a great Jewel of Gold, which he would ſend to him as a Token, that he would not defer his coming to the Place where he was.

<pb n="431" facs="tcp:51901:216"/> the colour of the Judgment of Baniſhment they might be ſeiſed; it being ſo done, the King cauſed the Goods to be put in Coffers, which he cauſed to be Locked, and Sealed by one of the Arch-Biſhops Clerks, by whom he ſent the Keys to him; and afterwards cauſed the Coffers to be broken, taking the Goods, and diſpoſing of them as he pleaſed; The ſame King alſo faithfully promiſed the Arch-Biſhop, That if he would go to the Port of <hi>Hampton,</hi> in order to go out of the Kingdom, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that by the Queen's interceſſion he ſhould be recalled; And if it ſhould ſo happen as he ſhould go out of the Kingdom, yet after <hi>Eaſter</hi> next coming, without fail, he ſhould return into <hi>England,</hi> nor ſhould he any way looſe his Arch-Biſhoprick: This he faithfully Promiſed, Swearing to it, touching the Croſs of <hi>Thomas</hi> the Martyr Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> Which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes notwithſtanding, the King cauſed the Arch-Biſhop to go out of the Kingdom, and wrote to the <hi>Pope</hi> for his Tranſlation; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and thus, and otherwiſe, by the Frauds and Cheats of the King, was the Arch-Biſhop, a Man of good Faith, craftily Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>

                     <p>This Queſtion, Right Honourable Lords, concerneth a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great Conſequence and Weight; the determining where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will aſſuredly procure, either ſafe Quiet, or dangerous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> both to our particular Conſciences, and alſo to the Common State: Therefore before you reſolve upon it, I pray you call to your Conſiderations theſe Two things: Firſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King <hi>Richard</hi> be ſufficiently Depoſed, or no? Secondly, whether King <hi>Henry</hi> be with good Judgment, or Juſtice, choſen in his Place? For the firſt Point we are to Examine, Whether a King being lawfully and fully inſtituted by any juſt Title, may upon imputation either of Negligence, or of Tyranny, be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Depoſed by his Subjects? Secondly, What King <hi>Richard</hi> hath omitted in the one, or committed in the other, for which he ſhould deſerve ſo heavy Judgment? I will not ſpeak what may be done in a Popular State, or in a Conſular, in which although one beareth the Name and Honour of a Prince, yet he hath not Supream Power of Majeſty; but in the one the People have the higheſt Empire, in the other the Nobility and Chief Men of Eſtate, in neither the Prince. Of the firſt ſort was the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Commonwealth of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who after the Form of Government which <hi>Licurgus</hi> framed, often-times Fined, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Fettered their Kings, and ſometimes Condemned them to Death: Such were alſo in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s time, the Petty King's of every City in <hi>France,</hi> who were many times Arraigned upon Life and Death, and (as <hi>Ambiorix</hi> Prince of <hi>Leodienſes</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth)
   <pb n="439" facs="tcp:51901:220"/> had no greater Power over the People, then the People had over them. Of the ſecond Condition were the <hi>Roman</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tranquil. in Caligula. Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus in prooemio.</note> Emperours at the firſt, of whom ſome, namely, <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Maximinus</hi> were openly condemned, others were ſuddenly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by Judgment and Authority of the Senate; and ſuch are now the Emperours of <hi>Germany,</hi> whom the other Princes by their Ariſtocratical Power do not only reſtrain, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo remove from their Imperial State; Such are alſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the Kings of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> and <hi>Swevelande,</hi> who are many times by the Nobility dejected, either into Priſon, or into Exile; Such likewiſe are the Dukes of <hi>Venice,</hi> and of ſome other Free States in <hi>Italy;</hi> and the chief Cauſe for which <hi>Lewes</hi> Earl of <hi>Flaunders</hi> was lately expelled from his Place, was for drawing to himſelf Cogniſance in Matters of Life and Death, which high Power never pertained to his Dignity.</p>
                     <p>In theſe and ſuch like Governments, the Prince hath not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Regal Rights, but is himſelf ſubject to that Power which is greater then his, whether it be in the Nobility or in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People; but if the Soveraign Majeſty be in the Prince, as it was in the Three firſt Empires, and in the Kingdoms of <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Iſreal,</hi> and is now in the Kingdoms of <hi>England, France, Spain, Scotland, Muſcovia, Turkey, Tartaria, Perſia, Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia,</hi> and almoſt all the Kingdoms of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africk;</hi> altho for his Vices he be unprofitable to the Subjects, yea hurtful, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> yea intolerable; yet can they Lawfully neither harm his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor hazard his Power, whether by Judgment, or elſe by Force; for neither one, nor all Magiſtrates, have any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the Prince, from whom all Authority is derived, and whoſe only Preſence doth ſilence, and ſuſpend all inferiour Juriſdiction and Power. And as for Force, what Subject can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, or aſſiſt, or counſel, or conceal Violence againſt his Prince, and not incur the high and heinous Crime of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                     </p>
                     <p>it is a common ſaying, Thought is free; free indeed from Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of Secular Laws, except by Word or Deed it break forth into Action; Yet the ſecret Thoughts againſt the Sacred Majeſty of a Prince, without attempt, without endeavour, have been adjudged worthy of Death; and ſome who in Auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion have diſcovered their Treacherous Devices againſt the Perſon of their Prince, have afterwards been Executed for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſame. All Laws do exempt a Mad Man from Puniſhment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Actions are not governed by their Will and Purpoſe, and the Will of Man being ſet aſide all his Doings are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, neither can the Body offend, without a corrupt or erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Mind; yet if a Mad Man draw his Sword upon his King, it hath been adjudged to deſerve Death. And leſt any Man ſhould ſurmiſe, that Princes, for the Maintenance of their own Safety and Soveraignty, are the only Authors of theſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Judgments, let us a little conſider the Patterns and Precepts of Holy Scripture. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> waſted all <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine</hi> with Fire and Sword, oppugned <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> a long time, and at laſt expugned it, ſlew the King, burnt the Temple, took away the Holy Veſſels and Treaſure, the reſt he permitted to the Cruelty and Spoil of his Unmerciful Soldiers, who defiled all
  <pb n="440" facs="tcp:51901:221"/> Places with Rape and Slaughter, and ruinated to the Ground that flouriſhing City. After all the glut of this Bloody But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, the People which remained, he led Captive to <hi>Chaldea,</hi> and there erected his Golden Image, and commanded, That they which refuſed to Worſhip it, ſhould be caſt into a Fiery Furnace. </p>
                     <p>What Cruelty, what Injuſtice, what Impiety is comparable to this?

                     <p>But, alaſs, good King <hi>Richard!</hi> what ſuch Cruelty? What ſuch Impiety hath he ever committed? Examine rightly thoſe Imputations which are laid againſt him, without any falſe Circumſtance of Aggravation, and you ſhall find nothing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected either of any Truth, or of great Moment. It may be that many Errours and Overſights have eſcaped him, yet none <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſo grievous to be termed Tyranny, as proceeding rather from Unexperienced Ignorance, or Corrupt Counſel, than from any Natural and Wilful Malice. Oh! how ſhall the World be peſtered with Tyrants, if Subjects may rebel upon every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Tyranny? How many good Princes ſhall daily be ſuppreſſed by thoſe by whom they ought to be ſupported? If they Levy a Subſidy or any other Taxation, it ſhall be claimed Oppreſſion: If they put any to Death for Traiterous Attempts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> againſt their Perſons, it ſhall be exclaimed Cruelty: If they do any thing againſt the Iuſt and liking of the People, it ſhall be proclaimed Tyranny.</p>
                     <p>But let it be, that without Authority in us, or Deſert in him, King <hi>Richard</hi> muſt be Depoſed, yet what Right had the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> to the Crown? Or, what Reaſon have we
  <pb n="442" facs="tcp:51901:222"/> without his Right to give it to him? If he make Title as Heir unto King <hi>Richard,</hi> then muſt he yet ſtay until King <hi>Richard</hi>'s Death, for no Man can ſucceed as Heir to one that Liveth. But it is well known to all Men, who are not either wilfully Blind, or grosſly Ignorant, that there are ſome now alive, lineally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> whoſe Offspring was by Judgment of the High Court of Parlement holden the Eighth year of the Reign of King <hi>Richard,</hi> declared next Succeſſor to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the Crown in caſe King <hi>Richard</hi> ſhould die without Iſſue. Concerning the Title from <hi>Edmund Crouchbacke,</hi> I will paſs it over, ſeeing the Authors thereof are become aſhamed of ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd Abuſe, both of their own Knowledge and our Credulity, and therefore all the Claim is now made by Right of Conqueſt, by the Ceſſion and Grant of King <hi>Richard,</hi> and by the general Conſent of all the People. It is a bad Wooll that can take no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; but what Conqueſt can a Subject pretend againſt his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> where the War is Inſurrection, and the Victory High and Heinous Treaſon? As for the Reſignation which King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> made, being a pent Priſoner for the ſame Cauſe, it is an Act exacted by force; and therefore of no force or validity to bind him; and ſeeing that by the Laws of this Land, the King alone cannot alienate the ancient Jewels and Ornaments pertaining to the Crown, ſurely he cannot give away the Crown it ſelf, and therewithall the Kingdom.</p>

So did <hi>Scilla</hi> by Terrour of his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, obtain the Law of <hi>Velleia</hi> to be made, whereby he was created Dictator for Fourſcore years; and by like Impreſſion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of Fear, <hi>Caeſar</hi> cauſed the Law of <hi>Servia</hi> to be promulged, by which he was made Perpetual Dictator; but both theſe Laws were afterwards adjudged void.

               <p>TO our moſt redoubted Lord the King in this preſent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
 his humble Chappellan <hi>William <hi>Archbiſhop</hi>
                  </hi> of <hi>Canturbury,</hi> to the <hi>petition</hi> brought into <hi>Parliament</hi> by the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> of the Kingdom, in which are contained certain Articles, that is to ſay, firſt, whereas our Lord the King, and all his Lieges ought of Right, and were wont in all times to proceed in the King's Court, to recover their Preſentations to Churches, Prebendaries, and other Benefices of holy Church, to which they had right to preſent, the Cogniſance of which Plea only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to that Court, by ancient Right of the Crown, uſed and approved in the Times of all the King's Progenitors, Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and when Judgment was given in that Court upon ſuch Plea the Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and other Perſons Spiritual, who had Inſtitution of ſuch Benefices within their Juriſdiction were bound, and had made Execution of ſuch Judgments by Command of the Kings for all the times aforeſaid without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption; for a lay Perſon could not make ſuch Execution, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and alſo are bound to make Execution of many other Commands of the King, of which Right the Crown of <hi>England</hi> had been in peaceable Poſſeſſion, as well in this King's Time, as the Times <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>f all his Progunitors, until this time. But of late diverſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes have been made by the holy Father the Pope, and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Excommunications publiſhed againſt certain <hi>Engliſh</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:51901:310"/> Biſhops, for that they have made Execution of ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in open Diſheritance of the Crown, and Deſtruction of the King's Regalie, his Law, and his whole Realme, if Remedy be not had.</p>
               <p>To this Article the Archbiſhop making Proteſtation, that it was not his Intention to ſay or affirm, that our Holy Father, the Pope, could not Excommunicate a Biſhop according to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Law of holy Church, anſwereth, and ſaith, that if any Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Proceſſes, Cenſures, and Excommunications ſhould be made by any Perſon againſt any Biſhop of <hi>England,</hi> or any other of the Kings Lieges, becauſe they made Execution of ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, he holds this is againſt the King, as it is holden or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the Petition, and therefore he will ſtand with the King, and with his Crown in the Caſe aforeſaid, to his Power. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

               <p>And alſo whereas it is ſaid and contained in the <hi>ſame Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that Clamour hath been made, that the holy Father the Pope, had ordained and purpoſed to Tranſlate ſome Biſhops of the Kingdom, ſome out of the Kingdom, and ſome from one Church to another within, without the Aſſent and Knowledge of the King, and without the Aſſent of the Prelate, which was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to be Tranſlated, which Prelates were much profitable to the King, and his whole Kingdom, by which Tranſlations if they be ſuffered, the Statutes of the Kingdom would be defeated and ſtraightened, and the wiſe Lieges of his Council without their Aſſent, and againſt their Wills withdrawn and removed out of his Kingdom, and the Riches and Treaſure thereof exported, whereby the Kingdom will be deſtitute of Counſel, and Wealth, to the final Deſtruction of the Kingdom, and alſo of the Crown <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of <hi>England, which was ſo free in all times, that it had no earthly Soveraign, but immediately ſubject to God, in all things touching the Regalie thereof, and to no other:</hi> Should it be ſubmitted to the Pope, and the Laws and Statutes of the Kingdom by him be Defeated and Annulled at his Pleaſure, it would be to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Deſtruction of the Kings Soveraignty, his Crown and Regalie, and of his whole Kingdom, which God forbid.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Archbiſhop making Proteſtation, that it is not his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Intention to ſay or affirm, that our holy Father cannot make Tranſlations of Prelates according to the Law of holy Church, anſwereth, and ſaith, That if any Executions of ſuch Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of any Prelates of the Kingdom were made, who were very profitable and neceſſary to the King and his Realm, or that the Sage Lieges of his Council, without his Aſſent, and againſt his Will, ſhould be withdrawn or removed out of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Kingdom, whereby the Wealth and Treaſure thereof might be deſtroyed; The ſaid Archbiſhop holds this would be againſt the King, and his Crown, and therefore he will be with the King Loyally in this Caſe, and in Suſtenance of his Crown, as he is bound by his Ligeance, and prayed the King this Cedule
