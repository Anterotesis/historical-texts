            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE most considerable part of the English Colonies professe they came into these parts of the world with desire to advance the kingdome of the Lord Jesus Christ, and to inioye his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ordinances with peace, and (to his praise they confesse) he hath not fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their expectation hitherto, they have found safety, warmth and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under his wing to the satisfaction of their soules. But they know, and have considered that their Lord &amp; master is King of righteousnes and peace, that he gives answerable lawes, and casts his subjects into such a mould and frame; that (in their weak measure) they may hold forth his virtues in their course and carriage, not only with the nations of Europe, but with the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous natives of this wildernes. And accordingly both in their treaties &amp; converse they have had an awfull respect to divine rules, endeavouring to walk uprightly and inoffensively, &amp; in the midst of many injuries and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies to exercise much patience and long suffering towards them.</p>
            <p>The Pequots grew to an excesse of violence and outrage, and proudly turned aside from all wayes of justice &amp; peace, before the sword was drawn or any hostile attempts made against them. During those warrs, &amp; afte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Commissioners by the premises observed Miantonimo's proud and treacherous disposition, yet thought not fit to proceed against him in that respect, till they had collected more legal and convincing proof.</p>
            <p>But while these things were under deliberation, Miantonimo was brought prisoner by Uncas to Hartford, and the case being opened &amp; clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as followeth, he craved the commissioners advice how to proceed with him.</p>

at all acquainting the English or advising with them, but more especially of late since the fore-mentioned plots and designes were in hand.</p>
            <p>First, a Pequot Indian one of Uncas his subjects in the spring 1643 aiming at Uncas life, shot him with an arrow through the arm, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently fled to the Narrowgansets or their confoederates, boasting in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian plantations that he had killed Uncas; but when it was known Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas (though wounded) was alive, the Pequot (taught as was supposed) chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his note, affirming that Uncas had cut through his owne arm with a flint, and had hyred him to say he had shot and killed him.</p>
            <p>Miantonimo being sent for by the Governour of the Massachusets upon another occasion, brought this Pequot with him, and would have covered him with the former disguise, but when the English out of his owne mouth found him guilty, and would have sent him to Uncas his Sagamore Miantonimo earnestly desired he might not be taken out of his hands, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising he would send him safe to Uncas to be examined and punished.</p>
            <p>But fearing (as it seems) his owne treachery would be discovered, within a day or two, he stopped the Pequots mouth by cuting off his head, but at parting he told the Governour in discontent, that he would com no more to Boston.</p>
            <p>After this, some attempts were made (as is reported) to take away Uncas life by poyson and by sorcery; these failing, som of Sequassons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany (an Indian Sagamore allyed unto, and an intimate confoederate with Miantonimo) shot at Uncas with an arrow or two, as he was going down Conecticot river: Uncas according to the fore-mentioned treaty 1638 complained, and the English by mediation sought to make peace, but Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quasson expressing his dependance on Miantonimo refused, and chose warr. They fought, and Uncas had the victorie.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Miantonimo without any provocotion from Uncas [<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>les the dissappointment of former plots provoaked] and suddenly without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing warr, came upon the Mohiggins with 900 or 1000 men; when Uncas had not halfe so many to defend himselfe. Uncas (before the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail) told Miantonimo, that he had many wayes sought his life, and for the sparing of bloud, offered by a single combate betwixt themselves to end the quarrel, but Miantonimo presuming upon his number of men, would have nothing but a battel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:95612:3"/>The iss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e fell contrary to expectation, his men were routed, divers of considerable note slaine, and himselfe taken prisoner.</p>
            <p>These things being duly weighed, the Commissioners judged that Uncas could not be safe, while Miantonimo lived; wherefore they thought he might justly put such a treacherous, and bloud-thirsty enemie to death, but advised him to doe it in his owne Jurisdiction, without torture or crueltie. And Uncas having hitherto shewed himselfe a friend to the English, and in this and former outrages (according to the treaty) craving their advise, if the Narrowgansets or their confoederats should for his just execu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Uncas heerupon slew an enemy, but not the enmity against him. The Narrowganset<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

This for a while cast an imputation of foule &amp; unjust dealing upon Uncas; but in September 1644 the English Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners meeting at Hartford, sent for the Narrowganset Sachems or their Deputies desiring they might be instructed to make good their charge.</p>
            <p>Uncas came hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es of wampom and such parcels of other good, to a great value, there might have been some probability of sparing his life, yet no such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels were brought, and the Narrowganset Deputies did not alledge; much lesse prove, that any ransom was ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The Narrowganset Deputies saw their proofs fell far short of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer pretences, and were silent. The Commissioners promised that upon better evidence heerafter, they should have due satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Wherupon a truce was made, and both parties were ingaged that all hostility should cease till planting time 1645: and after that, they would give thirty dayes warning either at the Massachusets or Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford before the truce should cease.

            <p>This crossed the former agrement, and the season was such, as neither the Commissioners could be advised with, nor could Uncas travell if notice had been given. After which, about or before planting time, Tantaqueyson a Mohiggin Captain who took Miantonimo prisoner, was dangerously and treacherously wounded in the night as he slept in his wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wam: and other hostile acts were on both parts attempted, in a private and under-hand way as they could take advantage each against other.</p>
            <p>But since the Narrowgansets have at several times openly invaded Uncas, so that Connecticot and New-haven were forced according to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, to send men from those Colonies for his present defence: but with expresse direction not to begin any offensive warr against the Narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gansets or their confoederates till further order.</p>
            <p>Jn the mean time messengers were sent to the Narrowgansets from the General Court in the Massachusets, signifiing the Commissioners meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, promising their agrievances should be fully and justly heard, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a cessation of warr in the mean time; but they refused: and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing probably that the English from the westerne Colonies were returned, they made a new assault upon Uncas, and have done him much hurt.</p>
            <p>The Commissioners being met, sent messengers the second time both to the Narrowganset and Mohiggin Indians, minding them of the former treatise and truce, desiring them to send their Deputies instructed and furnished with authority to declare and open the grounds of the warr, to give and receive due satisfaction, and to restore and setle peace.</p>
            <p>At first the Narrowganset Sache<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gave a reasonable and faire an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that he would send Guides with them to the Mohiggins, and if Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas consented, he would send his Deputies to the Commissioners, and dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eight days hosti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

themselves) by the course held at Hartford last yeare, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ers would mediate &amp; presse for peace, but they were resolved to have no peace without Uncas his head; it mattered not who began the warr, they were resolved to continue it; the Engl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>sh should withdraw their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison from Uncas, or they would take it as a breach of former covenants, &amp; would procure as many Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>anks as the English should affront them with: that they would lay the English cattle o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heaps as high as their houses: that no English man shold step out of doors to pisse, but he should be killed. They reviled Uncas, charged him with cutting through his own arm, and saying the Narrowgansets had shot him; affirmed, that he would now murder the English messengers as they went or returned [if he had oppertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity] and lay it upon the Narrowgansets.</p>
            <p>The English messengers upon this rude and uncivil usage, wanting Guides to proceed, and fearing danger, returned to the Narrowgansets, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted Pesicus with the former p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssages, desired Guides from him, he [in scorne as they apprehended it] offered them an old Pequot Squaw, but would afford no other Guides. There also they conceived themselves in danger, three Indians with hatchets standing behinde the Interpreter in a suspi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ious manner, while he was speaking with Pesicus, and the rest frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; expressing much distemper in their countenance &amp; carriage. The English messengers not hoping for better successe at that time, departed; telling Pessicus that if he would returne any other answer, he should send it to the English trading-house, where they intended to lodge that night In the morning he invited them to returne, and promised them a Guide to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas, but would grant no cessation of Armes. When they came to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they understood that in their absence a Narrowganset Indian had bin there, and faining himselfe to be of Conecticot, spake in that dialect, but could not put off the Narrowganset tone. He told Benedict Aarnold's wife (who well understands the Indian language) that the English messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers should not passe to the Mohiggins, he knew they shold have no Guides, but should be destroyed in the woods as they travelled toward Uncas.</p>
            <p>Thus the English messengers returned, and the Interpreter under his hand &amp; upon his oath related the former passages, with others lesse material more laregly.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Thus while rhe Commissioners in care of the publick peace, sought so quench the fire kindled amongst the Indians, these children of strife breath out threatnings, provocations and warr against the English themselves, so that unles they should dishonour &amp; provoak God, by violating a just ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and expose the Colonies to contempt &amp; danger from the Barbarians, they cannot but exercise force, when no other meanes will prevail, to reduce the Narrowgansets and their confoederates to a more just and sober temper.</p>
            <p>The eyes of other Indians under the protection of the Massachusets, and not at all ingaged in this quarrel, are [as they have expressed themselves to the English messengers] fastened upon the Engl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

If he perish they will charge it upon them who might have preserved him: and no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians wil trust the English (if they now breake ingagement) either in the present or succeeding generations. If Uncas be ruined in such a cause, they foresee their head, upon the next pretence shal be delivered to the wil of the Narrowgansets, with whom rherfore they shall be forced to complye [as they may] for their future safety; &amp; the English may not trust an Indian in the whole Country. The premises being duly weighed it clearly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that God calls the Colonies to a warr.</p>
