         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

She hath made his house a denne

this little treatise the laste
winter, at such houres as I coulde
borrowe of my bed: because my

one of the surest notes of the true

communicateth him self, and all
his graces with her. Firste I gather

of a booke, which you
had set out, I met
with your treatise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled
of the Lordes
Supper, printed anno
1581. supposing that your comming
home had stirred the mindes of men to
read and praise the thing, which had
lyen long dispised: I red also with hope
to find the arguments, that induced you
to turne your coate. But finding no
thing, which you might not, and in all
appearance did not knowe before your
peruersion: I pitied your miserable case
who hath a hearte at one time capable
of contrarie persuasions of your saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:18760:6"/>
and was woe, how be it it be worthie
no answere, that our men had let it lye
19. yeares without an answere: because
it seemed that that silence had made
you confident, and your sectaries hope
that it was vnanswerable. Wherefore
thinking it to be the worke so much spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, I resolued to doe it the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure,
that no man thought it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,
and set my selfe to answere it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you were some time my Regent.
After that I had answered the firste
cap. and a good parte of the seconde:
there came to my handes your seconde
worke. Then I perceaued my erroure, &amp;
stayed my hande to read it also. Hauing
red it, I rewed al, For argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in both
I founde none indeede, and few in show.
To flite, which is the greatest parte of
both these bookes, I thought it meeter
for a scoulde then a scholar. And the
last I founde contrarie to the firste, not
onely confuting, but condemning of
heresie the verie inscription thereof.
Your greatest gift for anye thing that I
<pb facs="tcp:18760:6"/>
can see is in nik-naming, and beleing
the Saints of God. That gift we can wel
be contented to leaue to papistes: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
such graces are more acceptable
to your pope, then our God. Some of you
hath purchased Bishoprickes, and some
Cardinalshipes, be that kind of eloqu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ece
But wee are assured that he, whome wee
serue, neuer rewardeth that arte with
better hyre then hell. Yet I wonder at
your impudencie, or rather stupiditie,
to hope that naked lies can win credite,
euen where the men of whom you speake
are most hated. Can any man beleeu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and presence of such a frequent as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie,
as vseth to be in the Church of
Edinburgh, the people woulde not haue
onely abhorred his doctrine: but stoned
him selfe out of the towne. Or can anye
man that hath a mans harte (that is
reason and vnderstanding) beleeue,
that if <hi>Iohn Caluin</hi> had vsed that

<pb facs="tcp:18760:7"/>
to publish in the face of the

that that people, who found the moyen
in a priuate grudge to banish him their
towne for certaine yeares: would not, on
such a notorious cause as that, haue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
stoned him in the streetes, or expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him at the leaste with shame for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.
But this is a note of gods iudgment,
that hee hath so besotted your senses,
that you haue not the wittes to caste a
probable collour vpon your lyes. This
was an other cause, that made me leaue
my purpose to confute your booke. For if
I had gone fordward, I sawe that I was
to meete with many slanders, which
was not worth the hearing, nor reading
and needed no other to confute them,
then the mouth that toulde them: if the
hearer had but halfe a nose to smell alye
as whote as a foxe. Yet hauing spent
many dayes, and nights in gathering
<hi>materialles</hi> to that worke, I resolued
not to lose them: but with some trauell
contriued them in this forme, which you

see: hoping that the power of reason and
truth might not onelie staye such from

Christe, that
night that hee
was betrayed,
into the hands
of the highe
preiste to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in his Church a solemne remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of his blessed passion, which hee
was shortly to suffer: instituted at his
last supper with his disciples; after that
hee had finished the lawe of the pascall
Lamb, in place there of a newe Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Elementes of Breade and
Wine. In this and with this after an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
maner, be a secret diuine ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacie,
hee deliuered also to their Faith
his precious Bodie and Blood, to vnite
them, and al that should succeede them
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:18760:9"/>
to be bone of his bone, and flesh of his

and his precious flesh, that in al ages it
hath exercised the hearts and minds of

some to life, and some to eternall death
and condemnation. For seeing the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
and excellencie of our omnipotent
God, consisteth in the highest perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of mercie, and iustice: his infinite
wisdome hath tempered his worde and
Sacraments to minister matter to both.
Therefore betweene his elect, whose
heartes he illuminates with the light of
his spirite: and those whome he hath left
to the iudgment of their owne fenses,
and illusions of errour, there hath risen
out of this cloude greate stormes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise

to meete his practises, and to arme
the simple against his sophismes, I haue
chosen this argument of reall presence
as of greatest importance to confute all
papistrie. For if the naturall bodie of
our Sauiour is not in the sacrament (as
they call it) of the altare, they haue no
sacrifice for the quick, and deade, and
wanting that, their market of masses
this fiue hundreth yeares hath beene a
faire of false wares. In this disputation I

will ayme my arguments to the poynt,
hoping that in all sounde iudgementes
weight of reason will be more effectuall
then the ratling sound of emptie words.
I will deduce the truthe of this poynte
out of the well of truth, and then will
proue the Church to haue receiued it
from Christ and his Apostles: and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the craft, and crueltie of
the enemie to haue kept it sincere, and
pure to our times. Lord shew to me the

            <p>Our Lord and Sauiour at the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of this Sacrament, tooke breade:
and after that hee had giuen thankes
broke it, and gaue it to his disciples say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Thus is my body, which is broken for you
this doe ye in remembrance of me.</hi>

               </gap>f<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
that the breade is turned into
the very natural, &amp; reall body of christ,
hauing no nature thereof but collour,
sauour, taste, and other inseparable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents.</p>
            <p>Wee on the other side, take them fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiuelie,
denying that there is anye
change of the substance: but that the
bread remaineth bread representing to
our soules the bodie of Christ to feede
our soules to eternall life.</p>
            <p>As for the wordes them selues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

of both senses, we grant that if both
scripture &amp; nature did not denye, they
maye be taken literallie. Againe that
they may be taken figuratiuely, if the

peruersnesse of the aduersarie will not
grant, other scripturs in the same forme

not a literall sense, that hee is a verye
<hi>doore, vine, or rocke.</hi> Ergo, these wordes
inforce not literallye that the breade is
his bodie, The speaker is one, the forme
is one, and there is nothing in the one
which is not in the other, to inforce a
literall sense. Of this see more in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
of Maister William Reinoldes

            <p>This ground being laide that these

to the letter wee ioyne with these men
vpon a new conclusion, that the figure
is moste consonant to the truthe, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
with the scriptures.</p>
            <p>To begin then, my first argument
is taken from the name, and nature of a
Sacrament. No sacrament is the same
thing, which it signifieth. The bread &amp;
wine in the Lordes Supper are sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18760:11"/>
of Christs body and bloode. Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,
they are not the thing which they
signifie: that is, they are not the body, &amp;
blood of Christ, The first part of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is a rule of nature deliuered vs
be a common consent of all the learned
before the dayes of ignorance, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistrie.

this see more hereafter in defence of

            <p>My next reason shal be from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogie
of the sacraments of the new &amp;

come, But the sacraments of the old co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant

were types, and figures of Christ

Paull confirmeth. <hi>The fathers did all

<hi>sacramenta iudaeorum in signis diuersa fuerunt

the sacraments of the Iewes did differ
from ours in signes; but are the same in

cannot denye.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I reason out of Christs own
words after that hee had absolued the
hole action, and his disciples had al eate
of the bread, &amp; drunk of the wyne: <hi>I wil</hi>
(saith he) <hi>no more drinke of this fruite of the
vine,</hi>

               <hi>while I drink it.</hi> laying this foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which I hope no man can denie, that
the breade is no other wayes his bodi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
then the wine is his blood. The fruite of
the vine is not the naturall bloode of
Christ. But that which he had consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
&amp; his disciples had drunken, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
that the fruite of the vine. Ergo,
that which hee consecrated, &amp; they had
drunken was not his naturall blood, &amp;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18760:12"/>
be like reason that which they had eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
was not his naturall and reall bodie.
The proposition being a negatiue of
things disparate, and diuerse is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable,
and the assumption is a text vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
be the mouth that could not lye.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the order of the institution
<hi>Iesus the night that hee was betrayed tooke
breade, and giuing thankes broke it, and saide
take eate this is my body that is broken for
yow,</hi> yealdes vs this argument. That
which hee broke, was the same which
they did eate. But Christ tooke breade
and broke it, not his essentiall bodie:
Ergo that which they did eat was bread
and not his essentiall bodie. The propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
is manifest in the wordes as they
lye. he tooke bread, hee brake it that is
breade: hee bade his disciples eate that
same bread, and of it saide, <hi>this is my body
which is broken for you.</hi> That which hee
tooke hee broke: that which hee broke
he gaue them: that which he gaue them
they did eate; and that which they did
eate, he calleth it his bodie. To applye
the verbes following, to an other thing
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that, which the first verbe is ioyned
with, is to teare Christs wordes in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18760:12"/>
and to parte the thinges, which hee
spake coniunctly. The assumption is
the very text. And further, when hee
broke the breade, Christ had not vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the wordes, bee vertue whereof
these men holdes that the breade is
changed into the bodie of Christ.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, out of the same wordes we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
drawe this argument. The thing which
he gaue them was his essentiall bodie,
as the breaking of it, was the breaking
of his bodie. But the breaking of the
bread was not the breaking of his body
for our sinnes, as it was done vpon the
crosse. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rgo, the bread was not that same
essentiall body, which was broken on
the crosse, but in a figure. The proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because as hee saith of the
breade it is his bodie: so hee saieth with
one breath, that it is his bodie broken,
<hi>this is my bodie broken for you.</hi> The assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is true, because the bodie of Christ
was not broken before his passion: and
because the breade was broken in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which his bodie was not.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, it is saide in the sixt of Iohn
<hi>He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood
dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi> Which words
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18760:13"/>
yealdes vs this reason: Hee that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the flesh, and drinketh the bloode
of Christ dwelleth in Christ; and Christ
in him. But all that eate the sacrament
dwelleth not in Christ, nor Christ in
them. Ergo, not all that eateth the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
eateth the flesh, and drinketh
the bloode of Christ. The proposition is
the text: the assumption the great heap
of vnworthie receauers doth proue.

That is, if you see the sonne of man
ascending, where he was before, What
is that? heerof appeareth the ground of
their offence. For they thought that
hee would exhibite to them his owne

As the breade growing out of the
earth, receauing the Lords institution,
is no more common breade: but the eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist
consisting of two things the one
earthlie, the other heauenly. So our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
receauing the eucharist, are no

            <p>Be these fathers it is cleere, that the

the eucharist, that is the communion of

and a heauenly thing.</p>
            <p>To conclud this matter, Chrysostom
saith <hi>in Vasis sanctificatis non ipsum corpus

            <p>And August, saith more peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<hi>Non hoc corpus, quod videtis, manducaturi
estis: non bibituri sanguinem, quem fusuri sunt
qui me crucifigent: sed sacramentum vobis ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quod

            <p>In these places which I haue quoted,
you haue plainely without any glosse al
that we teach, and beleeue of this sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
That the words of the institution
are figuratiue: That the action of eating
and drinking these mysteries is spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:
That the bodie of Christe, is recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> faith, not be the mouth: That the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18760:22"/>
wordes of the institution are to bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
literallie: That the body of Christe
which suffered for our sinnes, is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
&amp; not in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: That to eat
the flesh of Christ is to beleeue in him:
That the substance of the breade, and
wine abideth, and is not transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated:
And lastly, that the body of Christ
is neither in the holie vessels, nor eaten
be them, who receaueth this sacrament.
All these thinges I haue heere proued
(I saye) in plaine categoricall wordes,
which the aduersaries can not avoide,
without most odious and absurd gloses,
which the actours neuer knewe, nor
thought. Yet not-withstanding, they
vendicat these fiue hundreth yeares, as
the other fiue hundreth also, vntill the
dayes of Berengarius, and beareth the
ignorant in hand, that all is theirs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

hope that no man will count these alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationes
equiualent, except they proue
all the theoremes, and appendices of
transubstantiation as cleerelye as wee
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18760:23"/>
haue done. Notwithstanding whate
uer they or we can doe in this kinde, is
no proofe of the truthe, but a witnes of
the consent of tymes.</p>
            <p>Nowe in this place followeth next to
be considered howe this monstrouse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of transubstantiation began to
insinuate it self into the heartes of men
in the ages following, for from this time
forth it beganne dailye to grow, and to
gather strength. In the mysterie of the
sacrament, there is such a secrete, &amp; sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
coniunction of Christs blessed
flesh, with the seales as we can not well
vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, nor is lawful for vs curiously
to enquire: but reuerentlye to beleeue:
that his bodie is the bread, which came
downe from heauen, and giueth life vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the worlde. On Christs parte by the
secret and vnseene efficacie of his diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
hee conuaieth him selfe into our
soules to feede them vnto eternall life.
On our parts there is an action iointly
of the soule and bodie, the one recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the elementes with the mouth of
the bodie: the other receauing the body
and bloode of Christe bee the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th of
f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ith. In this action the whole powers of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18760:24"/>
the soule, and body are occupied at one
instant applying all the comforts of the
senses to the soule. The mouth tasting
sweetnes, presents sweetnes to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soule:
the stomach receauing refreshment,
mindeth the soule of refreshment: The
vitales receauing strength, comfort, &amp;
life offers to the soule, the strength, com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fort,
&amp; life: that floweth from the bread,
of which, who-so-euer eateth, shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
hunger nor thirst againe. To printe
this analogie into our heartes, and to
lift our senses from the sensuall consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of these present obiects, to the
spirituall contemplation of his absente
flesh, it pleased the wisdome of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
to name the figures of breade and
wine his bodie, and blood, broken and
shed for the faithfull partakers of these
mysteries. And that he doth not chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the substance as these men woulde
haue vs weene: but turning the vse of
bodilie meate to present to our deepe
speculation, the meate that feedeth the
soule to eternall life. This besides the
places alredie cited, Theodoret about
foure hundreth yeares after Christ tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
as resolutelie as euer did either
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18760:24"/>
Zuinglius or Caluin, his wordes ar these
faithfullie translated because they are
ouer long to set downe in his owne lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
<hi>Our Sauiour changed the names, to the
bodie giuing the name of the signe, and to the
signe giuing the name of the bodie. His purpose
is mantfest: for he would haue them, who did
participate his diuine mysterie to haue no eye
to the thing, which they sawe: but bee chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the names to apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the change made be
grace. For calling his naturall bodie bread, &amp;
meate, and calling him self a vine, hee honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the signes with the names of his bodie and
blood, not changing their natures, but adding
grace to nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This example of our Sauiour, all true
preachers in all ages, who laboured to
instruct the heartes of men in
these mysteries followed: &amp; when they
sawe the mindes baselye contented,
with the externall action, manie tymes
they amplifyed the presence of Christe,
with hyperbolicall argumentes of his
diuine power, to lift the heart from the
elements, to the thing presented be the
elements. For as mariners, betweene
two dangers in the seas, beareth of
that which they moste feare, towardes
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18760:25"/>
that which they leaste suspect: euen so
these teachers drew the people fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
elements subiect to the sense towards a
bodely presence, contrarie to sense, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
surmizing, that men woulde bee so
credulouse as to take such hyperbolical
amplificationes for simple suthes. The
deuill who hath alwaies beene red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of good to take occasions of ill, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
this weede with all helpes. Firste
hee bred in the heartes of men such a

that few resorted to them, as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

This continued well nye three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
yeares, without suspition of ill.
With the opinion of a corporall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
the deuil drew in be little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
that the verie bodie of Christ offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

to the father in the masse was a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
propitiatorie for the quick, &amp; dead:
and the people (as wee are all borne to
superstition, and idolatrie) imbraced
that more gredelie then any truth. The
Clargie spying the masses to become

greate cheates to the kitc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>in bee that
market, put to their shoulders, &amp; lifted
the sacrifice aboue the sacrament. So
this weede grewe dailie, as weedes
commonly growes fastest, till few could
find the truth, &amp; that onely such as dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
sifted the Scripturs, and fathers
of former times. It was long before men
grew so brasen faced, as to denye the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
in the words of the institution. The
first that wee reade to haue commed so
farre was Damascene, about the yeare
eight hundreth. After him followed Pas
casius, and Theophylact wel nye a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
yeares. These men broke the yce
to them that followed: but pearsed not

resolued as vpon all occasions to sing
one song. They disse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted in many things
from them that followed, and in sundry
thinges from themselues. At this tyme
and before this monster grew to a head
the Lord raised vp one Ioannes Scotus
besome tearmed Erigena paedagoge to
the worthye Emperour Charles the
great, a man of great learning, and well
red both in Greeke and Latine. This
man wrote a learned work, against this
erroure, and in the beginning of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to descry the firste conception and
whole genealogie of this mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ster. Soone
efter followed an other called Bertram
a preist, or as some thinkes a monke of
Corsbie in saxonie, where Pascasius al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
was bred. This booke is yet extant,
wherein hee learnedly cites the fathers,
mightely vrges the scriptures, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently
preuents the whole matter of
transubstantiation. This worke and the

in the flames whereof the booke
of Ioannes Scotus was quite consumed.
Yet there was an other prouided for it be
the Doctors of Louan, &amp; be the counsel
of Trent called <hi>index expurgatorius,</hi> not to
consume all (for that would haue beene
a discredit to the holye Church) but to

for the moste parte, swaied that waye.
Heere Maister William Reinolds in his
booke against Maister Robert Bruce
seemeth to leaue his reader to thinke
that these two men, are either theirs, or
neuters. They wrote darkely (saith hee)
of the truth of this Sacrament, and so

them see if it maye not better be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode
of the Church of Rome. Which
at that time began to persue their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
with fire and fagott: and made
Lawes, to compell all men to beleeue
vnder paine of both deaths temporall,
and eternall, that a rounde wafer, with
the picture of Christe in it, was the very
essential body of Christ, that was borne
of the virgine Marye. This was more
like to haue beene the loose deuill and
the lying deuil to, which euer since hath
raged in these partes, then that of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarius,
which was soone bounde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and vnder paine of burning com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled

was fell fleed for a fire that woulde
haue beene done in one day. But if these
books were not plaine with vs, I would
aske of Maister Reinolds, why the pope
burned the one, &amp; the <hi>index expurgatori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
mangled the other. But wee are
much beholden to him, how-be-it
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18760:28"/>
he denieth vs this antiquitie: yet hee
would faine haue it beleeued, that our
doctrine was condemned of heresie, in
the very daies of the Apostles. To proue
this,<note place="margin">Dial3 cap 19</note> he quotes Ignatius out of Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,
who saith, that some acknowledged
not the eucharist to be the flesh of christ
that suffered for our sinnes. These some
heritiekes he woulde haue taken to bee
men of our minde, that in those times
denyed transubstantiation of the bodie
of Christ. Yet if he had marked with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
iudgmente the drift of Theodoret
(for out of him the meaning of Ignatius
is to be gathered) hee might haue seene
that Ignatius spake of such heritickes
as Theodoret alledges him againste: or
else the allegation of Ignatius had been
impertinent. But Theodoret alleadged
him against Valentinian, Marcion, and
Manes, who denied Christ, to haue suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
reall paines in a reall bodie. Ergo
Ignatius spake of heritikes, who denied
Christ to haue suffered reall paines in a
reall bodie. For as odious as wee are in
Maister Reinolds eies, it will be as hard
for him to conuince vs of this erroure, as
to make the place of Ignatius other
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18760:28"/>
wayes to bee spoken of vs. This argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meut
of Ignatius was common amongst
the fathers againste that heresie: that if
Christ had not a true body, and suffered
not reall paines for our sinnes, the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
could not bee a figure thereof.
As Tertullia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reasons before, because me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
vse not to make figures of phantasies.
And heare it will be harde for Maister
Reinolds, to clenge his hart, and hands
of falshoode, and forgerie, for alledging
Ignatius out of Theodoret against that

about this question, which is a proofe
that a hundreth and fiftie yeares after
the debate in France, which Bertram
maketh mention of, that the right side
was then also a partie, and that, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Archbishope of Canterburie garded
with a greate armie of rascall ignorante
preists, who woone their dayly drink by
a disceatfull market of breade, for flesh.
On the other side, was the rest, &amp; better

so armed with multitude, that <hi>maior pars

aboute the yeare one thousand and fifty
Berengarius deacon of Sainte Maurice
in Angieres, wrote a letter to Lanfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
abbat of Bec-heloin in Normandy,
declaring the abuses of the Sacrament,
and commending vnto him Ioannes
Scotus his learned work vpon that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
It fell out that Lanfrancus himself
was then absent, and his conuent ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the letter sent it to the pope. There
the Pope summoned a counsel and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demned
the man being absent of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
and commanded Lanfrancus at that
tyme being his freind, to answere him
vnder no lesse paine then to be as great

was, satisfied them &amp; Hildebrand also,
prouing his doctrine be the Scriptures,

pope Nicolas the second, not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:18760:30"/>
with this summoned him to
Rome againe, to a counsell helde in the

him thither with faire promises, gaue it
him to his choise, whether he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
or burne. Where the cowardlie
man, now in his oulde age, for feare of
that, which was moste spent, made that
beastly recantation, which is yet extant
in Gratian, a perpetuall argumente
of his dasterdlye courage, and the
brutishe ignorance of that counsell, of
which the fyner papistes since hath
beene ashamed, and their owne glosse
saith in the decreits, that if it be not wel
taken, it is a fouler erroure, then was
that of Berengarius. Thus was that sillie
man counted before (as recordeth
Fuldebert bishop of Cenomanum) both
for life and learning, the flowre of his
age, compelled againste his conscience
bee a hersel of ignorant mules to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne

               </gap>reife, and terroure in the houre of his
death. After this the truthe beganne to
sinke, and ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ouerwhelmed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

of tongues decayed and he was counted

the greatest clarke that coulde speake
most barbarous Latine: and teare out of
whole peces, such distinctions as would
haue troubled all the schooles in Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to vnderstand. Notwithstanding this
cruell dealing with Berengarius Benno
Cardinall of Hostia recordes, that Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorte
the seauenth, before called Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand,
who at the commandement of
Victor the second, had hard Berengari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us

so vnresolued heereof, that hee
sent to Anastatius, to praye, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his Colledge to fast, to get
some secret reuelation from heauen, of
this mysterie. By which doubt of the
pope himself, it should seeme, that the
reasons of Berengarius were not lighte,
that sunke so deep into his heart (as hard
as it was) that the hole sea of rome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were impious inhumanitie. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the scripture, that must induce the
faith to beleeue a thinge so contrarie to
faith should be single, simple, pregnant,
and vncontrouleable. And now to their
arguments.</p>
            <p>The first is, that all sacraments shuld
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18760:34"/>
consist of simple,<note place="margin">M, Iohn hammilto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> con,</note> and plaine wordes

wordes, are not plaine and simple with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itie. Ergo, Sacraments shuld
not consist of figuratiue wordes. Firste
this argumente destroyeth vtterly the
na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ure of a Sacramente. For as August.
teacheth, all Sacramentes are visible
signes, of vnvisible graces, that is seene
figures of graces, which are not seene.
As for plainesse, figuratiue speeches are
many tymes playner then they, which
are without all figure. As for the wordes
whereon we stand, there is no speeche
more vsuall, when men presentes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
be lots, then this is I, and that is
thou. Mistake me not, I haue proued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redie
sufficiently, that the sacrament is
not a naked figure. As for ambiguitie,
will these men set the eternall worde of
GOD to the schoole, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>each him to
speake? What if the spirite of God will
haue his word so tempered, that it may
be the sauoure of life, to them that liue,
and the sauoure of death to them that
dye. Doubtlesse his sheepe knowes his
voice, and hee goeth in and out before
them. He maketh them rest in greene
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18760:35"/>
pastores, and leadeth them to the still
waters As for his enemies, he hath tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
their cuppe with galle, and mad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
the worde of life to bee a block in their
way. He hath left ambiguities for heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes
to waken his Church out of the
dreame of securitie. It is good (saith he,)
that offences be: but woe to them bee
whome they come. And in this poynte
it is a wonder, to see how God hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ense of these men, to seeke
a knot in a rushe, and to force a sens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
sense on his worde against sense.</p>
            <p>Secondly out of the same words they
make this argument. That which Christ
divyded amongst his disciples, was his
bodie broken for them. But his essential
bodie was broken for them. Ergo,
that which he deuided among his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
was his essential bodie. All this
we confesse to be most true, as our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
spake it, that is sacramentallie. That
which he deuided amongst his desciples
was sacramentally or figuratiuelye his
bodie, which was broken for them, that
is his reall and essentiall bodie in a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
but not bee transubstantiation or
mutation of the bread into his bodie.</p>

comparing the efficacie of Christes

bodie. This argument, for as weake as it
is, it will passe the cunning of all the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites
in Rome, and Remes to answere
without an instance in the question,
that the naturall bodie of Christe in the
sacrament, is neither visible, nor palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Which assertion is contrarie to
sense, damned bee reason, and without
warrant of the word, except an ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
place which I haue proued the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for 500. yeares to haue taken
figuratiuelye. If any amongst them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth
the fable of Gyges his ringe
which hee there alledges let them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
lyes, that wil. We admitt no such
proofe in maters theologicall.</p>
            <p>After this Maister Robert alledges
the articles of the Beleefe, not as an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
argument, then that of Peter in
the thirde of the Actes, as this wrangler
pretendeth: but as an other testimonye
againste their monstruous presence.
The argumente is the same that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
That Christ seeing he is in heauen,
is not in the Sacrament. To eleuat
this place, this wrangler alledges Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
interpretation of sitting at the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:18760:51"/>
right hand of God: and supposeth Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Robert to gather his conclusion
thereupon, that therefore, because hee
hath all power giuen him in heauen, &amp;
earth, he is not in the sacrament. But
this is wrong libelled, hee leaueth out
the tongue of the trumpe, and then
scorneth, because it will not playe. Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Roberts argument is, that Christ is
in heauen, at the right hande of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as it is in the beleefe. Ergo he is
not chowed, and champed amongst the
teethe of men in the Sacrament. The
force of the argumente is not from his
sitting, at the right hande of his father:
but from his being in heauen. And there
fore Caluins interpretation of his fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at the right hand of his father, is an
vntimely birthe. The same waye he mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shapeth
the argument of the Actes but
of that alredie.</p>

maye meane that: but that hee meaneth
that onely, is as vntrue. For hee left the
worlde, as hee went to his father: so the
text speaketh plainlye. But hee went to
his father body, and soule. Ergo hee left
the worlde, and as hee speaketh in the
second place, he is no more in the world
bodie and soule. The last place yealdeth
an other argument, which how-be-it he
is answered sufficientlye, yet I can not
omitt. Christ going to his father, did not
that in his humanitie, which hee sent the
other comforter to doe. But hee sent the
other comforter to abide with them for

bideth not with them, that is with

            <p>The 19. cap. he beginneth with a great
contempt of the arguments which he is

some derogatorie to Christs glorie, and
all without pith or power. The peeuish
ignorance whereof (as hee speaketh in

for the arguments, which hee in spyte

meaning) But the effect of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
is spiritual: Ergo the effect of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can not flowe from an vnseene, &amp;
vnheard corporall presence. This argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is <hi>in festino</hi> in the second figure. so
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:18760:52"/>
the <hi>maior</hi> and the <hi>minor</hi> this Priest lyke
a Doctour of the Popes divinity makes
no answere. The conclusion he condem
neth of Iudaisme, as making as strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
against the incarnation, death, and
passion of our Sauiour. I would rather
there were neither Pope, nor Cardinal
in the world, then that were true. Christ
came in the flesh to doe a bodely work,
not onely a spirituall. To performe the
law, to plant the gospell, to suffer death,
and at a worde, to offer sacrifice after
the order of melchisedech were works
to be performed in our flesh. And so it
was of necessitie that he tooke our flesh
subiect to iniuries, sicknesse, death,
and all the illes that hell, and deathe
coulde inflict. But Christe in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath no bodelie work to doe: and
therefore needeth no bodie in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
to effect the whole worke of
the Sacrament. This argument for as
peuish and pithlesse as it pleased Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Rainoldes to call it, let him doe
what hee can will leaue noe roume
in the Sacrament for Christs reall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</p>
            <p>The second is that if the breade and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:18760:53"/>
wine are changed into the bodie, and
bloode of Christe: there remaineth noe
signe of feeding, and nourishing, which
is a thing necessarie to the essence of a
Sacrament. This argument hee calleth
false in euerie pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te, and parcell thereof
and flat repugnante to the firste. And
why for-soothe? because if Christs cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
presence can not worke a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
effect, what neede we a signe of it?
See the wit of a sophist. Is this the sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
that some commendeth? bee the
cleane contrarie, if he were present bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
wee neede noe signe of his bodie.
But now that he is absent in bodie, the
signe is giuen vs, to minde vs of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and the greate worke of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
which hee accomplished in
his bodie. And so the deepe contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of that bodie, and that worke,

And therefore accidentes are
the signe in the sacrament more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlye
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18760:53"/>
then the substance. And this hee
proueth be the brasen serpent. This is
like the rest of it, his collection is quite
contrarye to his text. The brasen ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
is a figure of Christe. Ergo acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
is a figure of Christe without a
subiect. Howe so? is a brasen serpent an
accident? No, but it hath no thing of a
serpent, but the externall figure, which
is an accident. Well libelled Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam.
Did God ordaine that shape one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to be the figure of Christ? The texte
saith, Moses made a serpent of brasse,
and set it vp for a signe: not the shape of
a serpent. And because it hath no thing
of a verie serpent, but an accident, will
it follow that it is no thing but a bare
accident? Be such Logicke ye may well

that is doubtfull: and if it were certaine
yet that reason can sounde to no sense,
but such as haue prostituted their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

we beleeue with the Centurion, that he

breade of stones because he coulde. As
for this question, when Maister Iohn

his will was to create him selfe a new<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondlye he argues. It is blasphemy
to saye that Christes blessing worketh
no thing in the breade: and if it worke
anyething, it is no thing but transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation.
To this it maye be replyed,
that Christ hath not left vs in the worde

whether in the consecration hee keeped

That Christ said Masse thus he reasons.
The Masse is no other thing hut the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
