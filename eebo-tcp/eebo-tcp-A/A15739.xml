            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE CHRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STIAN READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T ſtandeth not either with my occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or my liking, to make a long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to that diſcourſe, which of it ſelfe ſeemeth to me ouerlong. Onely giue me leaue to informe the vnlearned of ſome few things, which may further him in the vnderſtanding of it. The manner of my anſwer is ſuch, as I haue vſed in my former writings. Firſt I ſet downe the Papiſts Treatiſe word forword: then I draw it into a right forme of reaſoning, that the truth may more euidently appeare: Laſtly, I frame as direct and plaine an anſwer to it, as conueniently I can with ſhortneſſe. If thou deſire fully to conceiue the whole courſe of this kind of anſwering, I muſt intreate thee to haue recourſe to the Preface, which I ſet before my anſwer to the 12 Articles; where the matter is deliuered largely and plainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. For the vnderſtanding of this preſent anſwer, it may ſuffice thee to know what is the meaning of certaine words of Art, as we call them, which I am inforced to vſe very often. Firſt then, a Syllogiſme is a certaine forme of reaſoning, which conſiſteth of three ſentences, whereof the ſecond is drawne out of the firſt, and the third ariſeth as a concluſion
<pb facs="tcp:21012:3"/>
from them both. The firſt of theſe three, is called the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition or Maior: the ſecond the Aſſumption or Minor; both of them ioyntly together are named the Antecedent: the third is termed the Conſequent or Concluſion. Therefore if I denie the Antecedent of a Syllogiſme, I meane to ſignifie that both the Propoſition and the Aſſumption are falſe: ſo must you conceiue ſeuerally, that which ſoeuer of the three ſentences I deny, that I take to be falſe. The conſequence is the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of one vpon another: ſo that when I ſay, I deny the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, my meaning is, that the latter part doth not follow vpon the former: for example, pag. 47. you haue this Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme:
<list>
                  <item>
                     <label>Antecedent.</label> 
                     <hi>Propoſ.</hi> If faith cannot be one vnleſſe it be entire, then it muſt be entire.</item>
                  <item>
                     <label>Antecedent.</label> 
                     <hi>Aſsu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p.</hi> But faith cannot be one, vnleſſe it be entire.</item>
                  <item>
                     <label>Conſequent.</label> 
                     <hi>Concl.</hi> Therefore it muſt be entire.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>My anſwer to this Syllogiſme is, I deny the conſequence of your Propoſition, that is, I ſay, it doth not follow that faith muſt be entire, if it cannot be one, vnleſſe it be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.</p>
            <p>There is alſo another forme of reaſoning, called an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymeme, which indeed is nothing elſe but an vnperfect Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme, conſiſting of either part of the Antecedent, and of the Conſequent. To this I anſwer, by denying either the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent or the Conſequence. For example, pag. <hi>177.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>Our Sauiour himſelfe citeth ſome words out of that Chapter, and expoundeth them to be fulfilled in himſelfe.</item>
                  <item>Therefore that Chapter is to be vnderſtood of our Sauiour Chriſt and his Church.</item>
               </list>
To this Enthymeme I anſwer thus: this Conſequent doth not follow vpon that Antecedent, which is all one, as if I ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:21012:3"/>
haue ſaid, I deny the Conſequence, that is, I ſay, that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not therefore to be vnderſtood of our Sauiour Chriſt and his Church, becauſe our Sauiour citeth ſome words out of it, and expoundeth them to be fulfilled in himſelfe. An example where the Antecedent is denied, though the Enthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meme be not plainly ſet downe, you haue pag. 327.
<list>
                  <item>The Pope is Peters ſucceſſor:</item>
                  <item>Therefore he cannot erre.</item>
               </list>
Here I deny the Antecedent, that is, I ſay it is falſe, that the Pope is Peters ſucceſſor. And this may ſerue for ſufficient inſtruction to the vnlearned, that they may be able to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and iudge both of the reaſons and the anſwers to them. It remaineth that I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend thee Chriſtian Reader, whoſoeuer thou art, that vnfainedly deſireſt the aduancing of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie by thine owne ſaluation, to the gracious direction of the holy Spirit, that he may teach thee to vnderſtand and beleeue to the praiſe of his name, and thy preſent and euerlasting comfort, through Ieſus Chriſt our onely Lord and Sauiour. Amen.</p>

                     <hi>BEing moued by ſome friends, to conferre with one of indifferent good iudgement, and of no ill diſpoſition of nature; though verie earneſt in thaet religion which he did profeſſe: I was deſirous to do my beſt endeuors, to let him plainely ſee, that the Catholique Romane faith was the onely right.</hi>

In the former, I firſt conſider his drift and ſcope: then how he proues that which he intends. His drift is to ſhew, <hi>That the Catholique Romane faith is the onely right:</hi> wherein he craftily begs that which is in queſtion; <hi>That the Romane faith is the Catholique faith;</hi> &amp; which himſelfe propounds, as the ſecond thing to be proued by him: <hi>That thoſe onely which profeſſe the Romane faith, are the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church.</hi> Neither can it be auouched by the authority of anie ancient writer, or by any good reaſon, that it is lawfull or fit to ioyne the terme Catholique (as Papiſts take it) to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church whatſoeuer.

Let the Papiſts ſhew, if they can, that in this whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie, the Catholique Church was euer reſtrained or coupled to anie one Citie, Dioces, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, or Nation, as it is now by them to Rome.

We ſee now what his drift is; how he proues that he intends: and by what reaſon he confirmes his proofe. It remaines that we conſider in general, to what part of his proofe, or confirmation thereof, euery Chapter in his Diſcourſe appertaineth.</p>
                  <p>In the 4. firſt Chapters he layeth certaine grounds concerning faith: in the 13. following he diſputeth the matter propounded.</p>
                  <p>Firſt he ſhewes the neceſſitie of faith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. then he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth three properties required to true faith. <hi>That it is one, Ch.</hi> 2. <hi>That it is infallible, Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>That it is entire, Chap.</hi> 4. In his diſpute, the twelue former Chapters, from the beginning of the fifth to the end of the ſixteenth, containe the antecedent, or firſt part of his reaſon, and the proofes thereof. The ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth addeth and enforceth the maine concluſion.</p>
                  <p>The aſſumption of the ſecond ſyllogiſme: <hi>That it is neceſſary to admit, &amp;c.</hi> is handled from the fourth Chapter to the tenth.</p>
                  <p>The propoſition of the firſt ſyllogiſme: <hi>That the faith which the authoritie of the true Catholique Church commendeth to vs, ought, without doubt, to be holden for the true faith:</hi> is proued by another reaſon, from the ninth Chapter to the thirteenth.</p>
                  <p>The aſſumption of the third ſyllogiſme: <hi>That thoſe onely which profeſſe the Romane faith; are the true Catholique Church:</hi> is debated from the twelfth Chapter to the ſeuenteenth.</p>
                  <p>This is the generall frame of the whole Treatiſe, as farre as I am able to conceiue of it. Now let vs examine the truth therof. Wherein that I may proceed the more orderly and plainely, I wil firſt ſpeake a word or 2. of ſome matters that ſeeme fit to be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21012:7"/>
vnderſtood, ere I anſwer particularly to the ſeueral propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</p>
                  <p>What the diuerſe ſignifications of this word <hi>faith</hi> are, and how many ſorts of <hi>faith</hi> there be, I will inquire (as farre as it is needfull for this Treatiſe) in my anſwer to the firſt Chapter: onely we are now to know, that by <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>beliefe,</hi> this Papiſt vnderſtands the <hi>matter</hi> or <hi>doctrine</hi> which is to be beleeued. This appeares in the reſt of this Preface, and namely at theſe words: <hi>Fourthly becauſe theſe few plaine points, &amp;c,</hi> as alſo euery where in his Treatiſe; though ſometimes (as I will ſhew in due place) he take it otherwiſe. The like I ſay of the word <hi>Church:</hi> which being diuerſly taken in Scripture, is here to be reſtrained to <hi>a certaine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of men vpon earth,</hi> as this Author himſelf ſhewes in this Preface, at the place aforenamed.</p>
                  <p>Now then to anſwer directly to his principall ſyllogiſme; I deny the whole antecedent therof. Becauſe it takes ſome things <note place="margin">To the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme.</note> for a knowne truth, which are either falſe, or, at leaſt, full of doubt. As for example, that <hi>the true Catholique Church is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men vpon earth:</hi> whereas who knowes not, that the ſaints, that haue bene, are, and ſhalbe in all ages, are members of the true Catholique Church, which conſiſts of them all ioyntly? That <hi>all the ſeuerall congregations, which hold the true doctrine of the Goſpell, are one and the ſame Church.</hi> A doctrine (in his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) without anie warrant of Scripture, as it ſhall be ſhewed hereafter. That <hi>there is authoritie in a certaine company of men vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth, to require, that whatſoeuer they deliuer, be held for an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth, vnder paine of damnation to all that wil not ſo beleeue them:</hi> whereas God vſeth not <hi>the authoritie</hi> of men, but <hi>their miniſterie,</hi> to the begetting of faith in them that ſhall be ſaued.</p>
                  <p>In particular I denie the propoſition; becauſe all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <note place="margin">To the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> in the world may erre, either in ſome one point not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall; or ſome in one, ſome in another. And therefore ſome things may be propounded by the true Church of Chriſt, which notwithſtanding are not, vpon any authoritie of theirs, to be held for true.</p>
                  <p>To the proofe of the propoſition ſet downe in the ſecond ſyllogiſme I anſwer, by denying the aſſumption: <hi>That it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">To the proof of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</note> 
                     <hi>to admit ſuch authoritie in the Church.</hi> The reaſons of my
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21012:7"/>
deniall are: 1: That God hath giuen no ſuch authoritie to anie companie of men, ſince the Apoſtles, or beſides them; who had it ſeuerally, euery one in his owne perſon. 2. That there is no neceſſitie of anie ſuch authoritie, for the ſaluation of the elect, or damnation of the reprobate. 3. That the Scriptures are left vnto vs for an abſolute rule, whereby all things that are to be beleeued muſt be tried.</p>
                  <p>I denie alſo the aſſumption of the firſt principall ſyllogiſme; <note place="margin">To the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and the proofe thereof.</note> and to the proofe of it, contained in the third ſyllogiſme, I ſay further, that they which profeſſe the doctrine that the Church of Rome now teacheth in many points, are members of the Church of Antichriſt, vnder the Pope the head thereof. But if, as you ſay, <hi>Thoſe that profeſſe the Romane faith, are the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church,</hi> how ignorantly and abſurdly do your Monkes <note place="margin">
                        <hi>In fidei profeſſ. anno</hi> 1585. <hi>art.</hi> 60.</note> of Bourdeaux write, in their ſolemne profeſſion of religion; where they ſay, that <hi>the holy, viſible, catholique, and Apostolike Church diſperſed ouer the whole world, hath communion in faith &amp; manners with the Church of Rome?</hi> If the Catholique Church haue communion with the Church of Rome, ſure the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church and the Church of Rome are not all one.</p>

Can he be ſaid truly to loue his father, that neuer cares to ſee what his fathers loue to him is; but contents himſelfe with ſo much knowledge of it, as men liſt to impart to him; yea that knowes not whether he had ſuch a father or no, but onely, as other men haue told him? We ſay not, that euery man is bound vpon hazzard of his ſaluation, to know euery point of difference betwixt you and vs, or to vnderſtand the ſenſe of euery place of Scripture; but that all true Chriſtians muſt labour for as much knowledge, as, by diligent hearing, reading and meditating of the Scirptures, they can attaine to. Neither ſhall they, by this ſtudy and endeuour, either abate their loue to God, or depriue themſelues of the ſenſe of his loue to them.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21012:17"/>
when a man ſhall feele the work of Gods ſpirit in his heart, kindling in him a deſire to vnderſtand the myſtery of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Ieſus Chriſt, to comprehend the infiniteneſſe of the loue of God the Father, and enlightning him to conceiue that, which, by his owne skill, he neuer were able to diſcerne. But they that follow your reſolution, neuer come rightly to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtant what the loue of God to them is: but if they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider things aduiſedly, muſt needes thinke God hath dealt hardly with them, as with ſeruants, not with ſonnes; whom he ſhuts out from the knowledge of his will, and view of his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome &amp; maieſtie, manifeſted in the writings of the old and new Teſtament; affoording them no more of that heauenly Manna, but ſuch chippings and parings, as their idle and prowd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates will vouchſafe to caſt them. He, that finds the loue of God toward him, in opening to him the true ſenſe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in matters concerning his euerlaſting ſaluation, doth beare more true loue to God for it, then any Papiſt can do, that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth in his blind obedience to men, &amp; maketh the end of his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God the deſeruing of euerlaſting life, by his ignorance of the Scriptures. As for true holineſſe of life, whence doth it ariſe, but from the feeling of Gods loue to vs; whereby the ſpirit of God which dwels in vs, inflames our hearts with the affections of kind children to ſo louing a father? Can you imagine, that he, who hath at moſt, but a kind of perſwaſion, of I know not what holy inſpirations &amp; bleſſings of Gods ſpirit, vpon ſome Prieſts or Ieſuits word, can loue God as truely, and feruently, as he, that knowes by the truth of God in the Scripture, <note n="d" place="margin">

                  <p>This interpretation of the Scriptures meaning, in requiring faith as a thing abſolutely neceſſary to ſaluation, is altogether vnneceſſary. For who knowes not, that there can be no ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without that which is abſolutely neceſſary therunto? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was more then enough to name <hi>the common tradition of Councels and Fathers.</hi> But ſuch gay termes make a goodly ſhew in the eies of the ſimple. But I pray tel me, what haue you got by this learned interpretation? Is there any Chriſtian man ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, as to deny, that ſome kind of faith <hi>is ordained as a neceſſary meanes, without which men cannot attaine to ſaluation in any caſe?</hi> Sure, this can neither hurt vs, who acknowledge faith to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and (if you ſpeake of iuſtifying faith) altogether ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to iuſtification: nor helpe you, who allow no faith, but that which depends vpon the authoritie of the Church. But the Councels and Fathers ſay, that kind of faith is neceſſary. What of that? Do they therefore hold it neceſſary to ſaluation for a man to beleeue whatſoeuer the Church ſhall teach, though without the warrant of Scripture? Can a man in no caſe attaine to ſaluation, without this faith? May not the very reading of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21012:20"/>
Scripture, without any miniſtery of man, be a meanes, by the worke of Gods ſpirit in his heart, to breed true faith to iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and ſaluation? The neceſſitie of faith is double.

Secondly, faith is neceſſary to ſaluation, becauſe no man can be ſaued that doth not beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt: that is, that doth not wholy renounce himſelfe, and reſt vpon Ieſus Chriſt to be iuſtified by his obedience and ſacrifice.

                     <hi>This one faith, without which we cannot be ſaued, muſt be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, and moſt certaine. This is cleare, becauſe faith is that credit or inward aſſents of minde, which we giue to that which God (who is the prime or firſt veritie, which neither can deceiue, nor be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) hath reuealed vnto vs by meanes of the preaching or teaching of the true Church: as we may gather out of S.

                  <p>That faith which ſome Diuines call hiſtoricall, is indeed ſuch an aſſent, &amp; goeth alwaies before iuſtifying faith; at the leaſt, for the beleeuing of ſo much, as is neceſſarie to iuſtification. Which I note by the way, that no man may be deceiued with an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that <hi>iuſtifying faith is an aſſent to the truth of Gods word:</hi> whereas it is quite of another nature, and hath place in the will, rather then in the vnderſtanding.

But how the true Church, or any Church at all, ſhould be ſaid to preach, I profeſſe, I vnderſtand not.

                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14.</note> Saint Paule, who ſpeakes not a word of the Church, true or falſe. And to ſay the truth, what a ſtrange kind of ſpeech is it to ſay, <hi>The Church is ſent to preach,</hi> when as onely the Miniſters preach, and not the Church: vnleſſe perhaps Iohn Baptiſt only for a time, was the Church: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he preached alone, before our Sauiour was baptiſed. But this ſame Church is a goodly faire word, and couers a great many foule errours, with the very name of it: The Apoſtles who were they that God employed at the firſt beginning of the Goſpell, both in preaching and writing, were vndoubtedly of the true Church, both in reſpect of their election to euerlaſting life, and of the truth of the doctrine they held. It is alſo true that God ordinarily
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21012:24"/>
begetteth faith in the hearts of men, by the miniſters of the true Church. But it is not true that ſuch an aſſent as you ſpeake of, cannot be wrought in a man by the miniſtery of Schiſmaticks or Hereticks, though they be perhaps, in neither reſpect, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny members of the true Church. Did not Arius, Macedonius, Eutyches, Neſtorius, and many other wretched hereticks aſſent in generall, to the truth of God in Scriptures, becauſe they held it to be the very true word of God? And might not men by their preaching be brought to the ſame faith? For our parts, we make no doubt, but that, in the middeſt of ignorance and ſuperſtition, many came to this faith by the preaching of your Antichriſtian Prieſts, and ſo do at this day; yea we adde further, that we doubt not, many haue (wee are ſure they might and may) attaine to the ſame faith (what if I ſay to iuſtifying faith too) without any preaching, by the reading of the Scriptures. For ſince it is partly the matter, that muſt argue the Scripture to be the word of God, partly the maieſty which any man may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne in the manner of writing: vnleſſe it can be poooued out of the Scripture, that the holy Ghoſt will not worke by theſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the heart of him that readeth, but only of him, that heareth a man expound this word vnto him, I ſee no ſufficient reaſon, why faith may not be had by reading, where Gods ordinance of preaching is onely wanting, and not wilfully neglected.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, the Apoſtle tyeth faith to hearing. Firſt, this is little aduantage for you Papiſts, amongſt whom (til ſhame &amp; emulation draue you to it, within theſe laſt fiftie or threeſcore yeares) no man could ordinarily heare the word of God in any tongue, that he vnderſtood; and ſo all your hearing was to no purpoſe. Secondly, if hearing be ſufficient, where there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but reading, without any expoſition of that, which is read; giue me ſome reaſon, why reading ſhould not be more ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; ſince he that readeth, may eaſier vnderſtand, and better weigh that, he readeth, then he that doth onely heare an other reade.

                  <head>A. W.</head>
                  <p>There are two things to be conſidered in your propounding of this queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, concerning the entireneſſe of faith: <hi>in what ſenſe all points muſt be beleeued,</hi> and <hi>what it is to miſbeleeue, or obſtinately not to beleeue.</hi> Whatſoeuer is deliuered in Scriptures, is a matter of faith, becauſe it is the word of God, who can neither deceiue, nor be deceiued, and hath propounded it to men for a truth to be beleeued. But yet there is a great difference betwixt things ſet downe in Scripture: and that difference is in 2. reſpects. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are all points therein true, in the like ſenſe, <note n="m" place="margin">
                        <hi>Thom. opuſ.</hi> 3. <hi>in compend. Theol. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Holcot. in</hi> 1. <hi>q.</hi> 1. <hi>ad</hi> 6. <hi>argum. princip. et in</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 1. <hi>art.</hi> 6. <hi>prim.</hi>
                     </note> neither is there like neceſſitie of beleeuing euery particular. Concerning the former, the generall reaſon why all things in the Scriptures are true, is this, becauſe all things therein are recorded, &amp; deliuered by God for true; therfore queſtionles they are true: yet (as once before I noted) onely ſo farre forth true, as they are intended to be held for true by the holy Ghoſt, the author of the Scripture. Whatſoeuer is regiſtred therein by vvay of report, as a ſtory, is to be taken as true, onely in reſpect of ſtory, that we may not doubt whether ſuch or ſuch things were done and ſaid, or no. There is no doubt to be made, but that the fiue bookes of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the bookes of Ioſua, Iudges, Ruth, Samuel, Kings, Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, &amp;c. containe a true and certaine ſtory of thoſe things whereof they intreate. But in theſe bookes we haue ſome wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and holy ſpeeches of godly men: ſome leud and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous words of profane wretches. The former are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged for the truth of God euery way. As for example, it is true that <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 1. 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> Iacob vttered thoſe propheſies of the twelue Patriarks his ſonnes; and it is alſo true, that thoſe propheſies of his, were the very truth of God. It is as true, that <note n="n" place="margin">2. <hi>Reg.</hi> 18. 30 <hi>&amp;</hi> 19. 4. 6.</note> Rabſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth deliuered thoſe blaſphemous threanings againſt the Lord and his people; but it is not true, that thoſe words came from God, as Iacobs did: ſo Iacobs were to be taken as euery way true; Rabſhakeths onely as truly reported from his mouth.</p>
                  <p>Now that all points are not alike neceſſary to ſaluation, no man can make any queſtion, if he remember that a man may be ſaued, though he haue neuer heard of many things that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Scripture: which is the caſe generally of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part both of Proteſtants and Papiſts, and hath alwayes bene
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21012:26"/>
the caſe of Chriſtians in all ages. As for <hi>miſbeleeuing, or not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing obſtinately,</hi> one of theſe differs a great deale from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the latter of the two was needleſſe, if the former can be proued. For if miſtaking ſome point of doctrine be damnable, it is out of doubt that obſtinate refuſing to beleeue the ſame point, muſt needs make a man much more liable to damnation.</p>
                  <p>But indeed <hi>miſbeleeuing</hi> is not in all points ſo dangerous, though of it ſelfe as a ſinne, it is ſubiect to be puniſhed <note n="o" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23.</note> with the eternall wrath of God in hell fire. To make plaine that I ſay, A man may miſunderſtand diuers places of Scripture, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon hold that to be true which is falſe, and yet be ſaued for all this error. For example, that I may giue inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in a matter of no ſmall importance. How many Chriſtians, yea how many great Diuines haue bin deceiued, in the vnderſtanding of <note n="p" place="margin">

                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. 17. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 44.</note> propheſies of the old teſtament, concerning the Meſſiahs kingdome? yet were they out of danger of damnation, and in the ſtate of grace all that time, becauſe <note n="x" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioan.</hi> 1. 29. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. 68. 69.</note> they reſted on our Sauiour Chriſt, as the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Sauiour of their ſoules, that ſhould tak away their ſinnes, and bring them to euerlaſting life in heauen, though they erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly hoped for a temporall kingdome alſo. The other branch of this diſtribution, which concernes <hi>obſtinately not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing,</hi> though it be a farre greater ſinne, then the former: yet it is not ſuch, that it doth abſolutely cut a man off from ſaluation.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21012:27"/>
This obſtinate refuſall to beleeue, is either of ignorance, or of wilfulneſſe: if a Chriſtian ſtand ſtifly in ſome falſe opinion, which he certainly holdeth to be true, in his error; the fault of his iudgement may continue, without the damnation of his ſoule. If wilfully he refuſe to beleeue that truth of God, which he diſcerneth, no man can promiſe him any hope of ſaluation, without true repentance. This I ſpeake vpon a ſuppoſition, that it is poſſible for a man not to beleeue that, which he perceiueth to be true, though indeed there is a contradiction implied herein. For to beleeue is to aſſent to the truth; which a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuſe but do, that ſees it: that is, no man can think the ſame thing, in the ſame reſpects, true and falſe. But this not beleeuing in ſuch a caſe, is a frowardneſſe of the heart, not yeelding to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that he knowes, rather then a falſe opinion in the braine, by which a man is miſled. We are further to obſerue, that there is a ſecond difference in this point, in regard of the matter, which is not beleeued. If a man in his ignorance deny to beleeue, that <hi>there is but one God,</hi> that <hi>there are three perſons,</hi> that <hi>Ieſus is the Meſſiah,</hi> that <hi>we are redeemed by him,</hi> that <hi>we are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by faith without workes,</hi> or any other fundamentall point of religion; he doth thereby ſhut himſelfe out from all poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of ſaluation, as long as he continues in theſe errors, or any of them. But other points there are, and thoſe many more in <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Thomas opuſc. comp. Theol. c.</hi> 1</note> number, which a man, by reaſon of his ignorance, may obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately refuſe to beleeue, and yet not be excluded out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for ſuch his error. Let the former examples ſerue for breui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſake: I haue bene longer then I would or meant to be; but I was deſirous to ſpeake plaine, in a matter of ſuch weight. The concluſion is, that howſoeuer it is indeed a ſinne, and ſo (in it ſelfe) damnable, <hi>to miſbeleeue,</hi> or <hi>not beleeue</hi> all and euery thing which God hath reuealed; yet a man may be in the ſtate of grace and ſaluation, though he misbeleeue, or (through ignorance) obſtinately not beleeue ſomething ſo reuealed. In a word, <hi>Not right beleeuing</hi> is neuer able to depriue a man of ſaluation, but when that we beleeue amiſſe, is a maine point of ſaluation: <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately not beleeuing</hi> onely then ſhuts vp heauen againſt vs, when either the points we will not beleeue, are fundamentall,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21012:27"/>
or our refuſing to beleeue, is againſt our owne iudgement and conſcience. If you had no further reach in this Chapter, we were of the ſame mind with you: but in propounding the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of your aſſertion, you bewray a further matter, then at the firſt a man would imagine.</p>

                  <p>The concluſion of this Syllogiſme is acknowledged by vs for a certaine truth, <hi>Faith muſt be entire:</hi> but the premiſſes ſeeme liable to iuſt exception. For firſt, the antecedent and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <note place="margin">To the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> of the propoſition are all one; and ſo the proofe, and that which is proued, differ not.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21012:28"/>
but as the obiect or things beleeued make a difference, which reacheth not to the faith it ſelfe within the ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Secondly the Aſſumption, though it be true, yet doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſomething that had need to be warily conſidered.

                  <p>This is a proofe of your Aſſumption; wherein for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence <note place="margin">To the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> of your propoſition, I would haue all men vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that although you craftily imply therein a compariſon of equalitie, betwixt the charge of beleeuing the Apoſtles, and all other Miniſters allowed by you, whom you call by the name of <hi>the Church,</hi> to deceiue ſimple people with ſo glorious a title: yet the truth of that propoſition depends not thereupon, but onely vpon the neceſſitie of beleeuing that which God hath reuealed. It is a certaine truth, that God is to be beleeued in all things he hath reuealed, by whom ſoeuer he propound it: &amp; in this reſpect the conſequence of your propoſition is true: That if it were damnable not to beleeue the Apoſtles deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that which God had reuealed, it is alſo damnable not to giue credit to Miniſters now, when they propound that to be beleeued, which God hath reuealed; becauſe the reaſon of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing is, that God hath reuealed the things that are deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But yet here are two differences to be obſerued: firſt, that it is leſſe ſinne to doubt of that, which any man, beſides the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, deliuers, though it be the word of God, then to make queſtion of the ſame matter vttered by the Apoſtles: becauſe they ſpake immediatly by the direction of the ſpirit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not poſſibly erre in any point; whereas all other men are ſubiect to error, and their doctrine to examination, ere it need be credited. Secondly, we muſt remember, it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that if our Sauiour ſaid, whoſoeuer beleeued not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ſhould be damned; then he that beleeues not the Miniſters now, in all they propound to be beleeued, ſhould be therefore
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21012:29"/>
liable to condemnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I haue ſtood the more vpon this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, becauſe the conſequence being true, may breed an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in the conceit of many, if the reaſon of it be not truly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>
                  <p>Your Aſſumption or minor is thus to be limited, according <note place="margin">To the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note> to that which I before deliuered, He that beleeues the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſpake immediatly by the inſpiration of the ſpirit of God, and yet doubts of the truth of ſome things they prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, cannot without reforming this error be ſaued; becauſe he holds that the holy Ghoſt may inſpire an vntruth. No more can he that doth not beleeue they ſpake by ſuch inſpiration. For of them our Sauiour hath abſolutely ſaid, <note n="c" place="margin">

Therefore though our Sauiour except no point, nor diſtinguiſh betwixt matters of doctrine, yet the not beleeuing of ſome, is no farther damnable, then a man doth wilfully refuſe to beleeue that, which he confeſſeth to be truth in his heart; or at the leaſt, in which he thinkes the Apoſtles were deceiued, or which he deſpiſeth as needleſſe, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes the wiſedome of God, in propounding it to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued.</p>

                        <item>Therefore miſbeleeuing or obſtinately not beleeuing any one point reuealed by God, and propounded by his Church to be beleeued, is damnable.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>To let paſſe this craftie conueyance, whereby you ſtill ſhuffle in the Church, whereas without it, the matter is as true, and <note place="margin">To the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note> the propoſition as perfect: I anſwer to your aſſumption; that all <hi>miſbeleeuing,</hi> or <hi>obſtinately not beleeuing</hi> is not a notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie to Gods truth, nor a great diſobedience to his will: where it proceeds ſimply of ignorance, and not of wilfulneſſe; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in ſuch caſes as I ſhewed in the end of the laſt ſection: which I ſpeake, not to excuſe any man, as if he did not ſinne, in misbeleeuing, or as if there were ſome ſinne not deadly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your erroneous conceit: but onely to diſtinguiſh notable iniuries, and great diſobedience from ſome kinde of misbeleeuing.</p>
                  <p>The concluſion is thus to be conceiued: That <hi>miſbeleeuing is in it ſelfe damnable,</hi> not, that <hi>no man can be ſaued, which miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeueth.</hi>

                  <p>This diſtinction of beleeuing <hi>expreſly,</hi> and <hi>implicitly,</hi> as you terme it, confirmes part of that, which I haue hitherto ſaid: for by your confeſſion, there are ſome points, to the beleefe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a general faith will not ſerue the turne, but a man muſt know the particulars, and aſſent actually to the truth of them. For example, it is not enough for a man to beleeue in groſſe, that <hi>he muſt be ſaued by ſuch meanes onely, as God hath reuealed; and</hi>

                     <hi>the Church hath propounded to be beleeued;</hi> but it is abſolutely neceſſarie to ſaluation, that he know what the Church holdeth in this caſe, concerning redemption by our Sauiour Chriſt; and in his heart acknowledge the truth thereof. Againe, there are many other points, which, ſo a man neglect not the meanes to know them, may be vnknowne, and beleeued onely in generall, without danger of damnation, by reaſon of ſuch ignorance. Now this generall beleefe, is not (as you falſely ſay) to be folded vp in the faith of the Church; but to be tied to the Scripture; all things wherein I acknowledge to be moſt true, and beleeue all points whatſoeuer, as they are eyther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, or contained in Scripture: howſoeuer I be ignorant what is true, touching, (perhaps) very many particulars.</p>
                  <p>To the authoritie of the Church, I willingly ſubmit my ſelfe thus farre, as that I hold it a ſinfull preſumption for me, or any man, eyther to compare my priuate opinion, with the generall iudgement of other Chriſtians, eſpecially Miniſters, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, or ſuſpect that of falſhood, which they deliuer, vnleſſe I haue apparent proofe for the one, and great likelihood for the other.

There is indeed an abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, that all men ſhould agree in the beleefe of certaine points, without the beleefe whereof, there can poſſibly be no ſaluation.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:21012:31"/>
Gods truth is in euery particular to be beleeued; yet it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired as a meanes, without which a man cannot be ſaued, as I haue already ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>I grant the aſſumption in that ſenſe you vnderſtand <hi>being one;</hi> otherwiſe I denie it. <hi>Faith may be one in all points neceſſary to</hi>

                  <p>Neither is your proofe ſufficient, if we grant your expoſition.

                     <note n="m" place="margin">Sect. 1.</note> before in generall concerning this point, about liableneſſe to damnation. There is no hereſie nor error in matter of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but it is a ſinne: and being ſo, makes the partie that doth erre, liable to damnation. But yet many errors and hereſies are of ſo ſmall moment in compariſon of other, that hee which hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them, may, notwithſtanding ſuch his error or hereſie, be ſaued.

Chap. 1. ſect. 5.</note> A man may be excuſed, in your iudgement, by ignorance, concerning any poſitiue commaundement of God: but out of doubt, there are many points of truth reuealed by God, onely as poſitiue, not as ſuch meanes to ſaluation, that without the beleefe of them a man cannot be ſaued. Adde hereunto, that a Chriſtian may be ignorant of many points held by the Church, and that by negatiue ignorance, becauſe he could neuer come where he might heare, that the Church beleeued ſuch and ſuch things. It is therefore an vnreaſonable thing, to condemne all ignorance for hereſie: and a moſt vncharitable conceit to caſt all into hell fire that beleeue not in euery point, as the Church generally doth, yea though they know what the Church main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teines, &amp; be of a contrarie mind. Your proofe, which is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of likeneſſe or equality betwixt <hi>infidelitie</hi> in denying all Chriſtian religion, and <hi>hereſie</hi> in not beleeuing ſome points of it, is a great deale too weake.

But to let that paſſe, becauſe it is of no great moment; I am now earneſtly to requeſt all men, Proteſtants and Papiſts, who will vouchſafe to reade my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that they would giue me leaue to examine this treatiſe by the light of true reaſon, and themſelues take a little paines, more then ordinary in the vnderſtanding of it. We are then firſt of all to remember, that the ſumme of this treatiſe was propounded by the author himſelfe in his preface, to this effect: <hi>That the faith which the authoritie of the true Catholick Church commendeth to vs, is, without doubt, to be holden for the true faith: and that the faith which the authoritie of the Church of Rome commendeth to vs, is that faith.</hi> Now then theſe two points being proued, that which was intended, is diſpatched; and either of theſe failing, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ſtill in queſtion. For proofe of the former propoſition or ſentence, he diſputeth on this maner: <hi>That we muſt needs admit an infallible authoritie in the Catholicke Church, by reaſon whereof euery one muſt learne of it onely what is the true faith.</hi> Now he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſeth himſelfe to the proofe of this laſt propoſition, which, as I ſhewed in my anſwer to the Preface, is the aſſumption of his ſecond Syllogiſme: and thus he reaſoneth:
<list>
                        <item>If God haue not prouided ſome rule or means, whereby euery man learned and vnlearned, may ſufficiently in all points, queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or doubts of faith, be infallibly inſtructed, what is to be holden for the true faith, vnleſſe we admit ſuch an authority, then we muſt needs admit it.</item>
                        <item>But God hath not prouided any rule or meanes, vnleſſe we admit ſuch an authoritie.</item>

                  </p>

I will be as plaine as I can, that euery one may vnderſtand me. If his meaning be, that we muſt admit ſuch an authoritie in the Catholicke Church, becauſe without it there are no ſufficient meanes of ſaluation for euery particular learned and vnlearned man.

For neither is it neceſſary to ſaluation, that a man ſhould be infallibly inſtructed in all points, queſtions, &amp; doubts of faith, and God neuer had any purpoſe, that euery particular man ſhould be affoorded that meanes of ſaluation. I will not ſpend time nor labor in this point: it may be proued ſufficiently by this his argument. For theſe means, he imagineth of a viſible Church alwayes continuing, are not ſuch, but that before the comming of our Sauiour, and ſince alſo, many thouſands haue liued and died, which could neuer haue any ſuſpition or thought of ſuch a Church. Till it pleaſed our Sauiour <note n="z" place="margin">

<list>
                        <item>If neither the Scripture alone, nor naturall wit or learning, nor a priuate ſpirit, can be ſuch a rule, then God hath prouided no ſuch rule, vnleſſe we admit an infallible authority in the Catholicke Church.</item>

                  <p>This propoſition is not ſet downe by you in plaine termes, but neceſſarily and certainly gathered out of the courſe you hold in the fiue next chapters: wherein the aſſumption and concluſion are manifeſtly contained; that in the foure former; this in the tenth.</p>
                  <p>The conſequence of your propoſition is verie weake: For, <note place="margin">To the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> what if none of theſe (ſeuerally) be ſuch a rule? may not all theſe together be?

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:21012:39"/>
rule, though there be no companie of men, that hath any ſuch authoritie as you ſpeake of.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, your conſequence is but feeble in an other reſpect. For it preſumeth, that if there be ſuch an authoritie, there is ſuch a rule. Whereas many thouſands in the world may be vtterly without meanes of knowing that there is ſuch an authoritie, and ſo the meanes, as in regard of them, inſufficient. Adde hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that although it were poſſible, and eaſie for euery man to know and ſee the Church: yet the meanes might be inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: becauſe there is no certaine reaſon to perſwade them, that they muſt beleeue this Church in all things: ſo that ſtill, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your doctrine, the Lord muſt needs haue failed much in his prouidence, though he haue giuen this authority to the Church: becauſe he hath prouided no meanes whereby euery man may certainly be perſwaded, that the Church hath ſuch authoritie. Will you ſay, <hi>He hath appointed that all men ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the Church?</hi> What can that helpe, when he hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided meanes, for all men to know, that they muſt beleeue her? Muſt we not come now to a priuate ſpirit, that is, to the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Gods ſpirit in the hearts of particular men? And if this muſt needs be in this one caſe, how prooue you, it may not be ſo in other? To anſwer, <hi>we muſt beleeue the Church,</hi> is to beg the queſtion, againſt all reaſon.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>Ere I come to anſwer your Syllogiſme, giue me leaue to ſhew how obſcurely and doubtfully theſe properties are deliuered by you. Firſt <hi>infallible</hi> is taken in two diuers ſenſes. <hi>Faith muſt be infallible. The rule muſt be infallible.</hi> In the former we muſt needs expound <hi>infallible,</hi> not being deceiued by holding any errour, or nor doubting of that which it beleeueth. In the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what can <hi>infallible</hi> ſignifie, but either that, which is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, or that, which may not be doubted of? Is it plaine dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſpeake ſo doubtfully? Or is it a good kinde of reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to runne the ring, and to diſpute in a circle, as they ſpeake in the Schooles? <note n="x" place="margin">Chap. 3. Sect. 3.</note> Before, you would prooue <hi>the infallibility</hi> of faith, <hi>by the infallibility</hi> of the word of God, which it muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue: now you conclude <hi>the infallibility</hi> of the rule, from <hi>the infallibility</hi> of faith. Is not this to trifle, rather then to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? Would you not laugh at vs, if we ſhould diſpute thus? The elect cannot fall away, becauſe the holy Ghoſt, that vpholds them, is true God. The holy Ghoſt is true God, becauſe the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, whom he vpholds, cannot fall away. View your ſelfe in this glaſſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, what would a reaſonable man conceiue by theſe words, <hi>The rule muſt be certainly and plainly knowen:</hi> but that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:21012:40"/>
euerie man muſt be able to perceiue that this, or that is the rule? What is your meaning? That <note n="y" place="margin">Chap. 7. Sect. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>the rule muſt not be hard to be vnderſtood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, your terme of <hi>vniuerſalitie</hi> is not ſo plaine, as it might haue bene; becauſe it is commonly, I thinke euery where in this Treatiſe, ſaue in this one chapter, taken for that which belongs to all perſons, times and places: no where for all points of doctrine, no not there, <note n="z" place="margin">Chap. 4.</note> where you ſpeake of the entireneſſe of faith. And I pray you tell me, why, as you apply <hi>infallibilitie</hi> to faith and the rule, you do not in like ſort deale with entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſay that <hi>the rule muſt be entire, becauſe faith muſt be entire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I come now to your propoſition, which I denie: becauſe it <note place="margin">To the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> is not neceſſarie, that the rule of faith ſhould be ſuch, as may be certainly and plainly knowen, that is vnderſtood in euery point. It is ſufficient, if it may be vnderſtood in thoſe points, that are neceſſarie to ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                     <hi>Out of theſe former grounds foure concluſions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> The firſt concluſion <hi>is, that Scripture alone, eſpecially as it is by Proteſtants tranſlated into the Engliſh tongue; cannot be this rule of faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This I prooue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, for that theſe tranſlations faile in the firſt condition; that is to ſay, they are not infallible (as the rule of faith muſt be); for neither were the Scriptures written in this language, immediately by the holy Ghoſt: neither were the tranſlators aſſiſted by the ſame holy Ghoſt infallibly. Infallibly (I ſay) that is, in ſuch ſort, as it were vnpoſſible that they ſhould erre in any point. Sith, therefore, the tranſlators, as being but men, may erre. (To ſay nothing of that which by</hi> Gregory Martin <hi>is prooued: and by the often changes of new and variable tranſlations is ſhewed that ſome haue erred) how can a man, (and eſpecially an vnlearned man, who hath not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent meanes, learning, nor leiſure to compare the tranſlations with the prime authenticall originall) how can (I ſay) ſuch a man be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly ſure, that this particular tranſlation, which he hath, doth not erre? And if in ſome places it erre; how can he be infallibly ſure, that in thoſe places, which do ſeeme to fauour that ſect, which he followeth, it doth not erre? vnleſſe he wil admit an vnfallible autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in the Church, to aſſure vs, that ſuch, or ſuch a tranſlation doth not erre, in any point; of which authoritie, I ſhall ſpeake more hereafter.</hi>
                  </p>
               </div>
               <div type="commentary">
                  <head>A. W.</head>
                  <p>The Scripture is, in it ſelfe, ſuch a rule or meanes, and (no doubt) ſo made effectuall to ſome by reading, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther outward helpe of man: but this is not the ordinarie courſe, that God hath appointed, for the inſtruction of the people, in the knowledge of his truth. Therefore, if at any time we ſay, that <hi>the Scripture alone,</hi> is the rule of faith, by <hi>Alone,</hi> we ſeuer it from the traditions and authoritie of men, not from their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie: and aſcribe vnto it ſufficiencie in reſpect of the matter to be beleeued, not ſimply of the meanes to bring men to beleefe.</p>
                  <p>The aſſumption, which you ſhould prooue (as alſo the title of your chapter profeſſeth) is this, <hi>That the ſcripture alone, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the rule of faith.</hi> By what reaſon do you prooue it? Truly
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:21012:41"/>
by none at all: but leauing the queſtion, you diſpute againſt the Engliſh tranſlation. Wherefore I take it for granted, that, in your conſcience, you acknowledge the ſufficiency of the Scripture, to direct vs in all matters and queſtions of faith. And thereupon I inferre, that the infallible authoritie, which you would tie to the Church, is needleſſe; becauſe, without it, there is a ſufficient rule of faith prouided by Almightie God, whereby euerie man, learned and vnlearned, may be inſtructed in all points of faith, what is to be holden for true. Hence it followeth, that the firſt of your maine points, ſet downe in the preface is falſe, and ſo your whole Treatiſe void &amp; vntrue. You tell vs indeed afterward, that <hi>ſome of your reaſons againſt the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh tranſlation haue alſo force to prooue, that the Scripture alone, in what language ſoeuer, is no ſufficient meanes:</hi> but you neither ſhew vs, which thoſe reaſons are, nor are there any of ſufficient weight to that purpoſe. Let them iudge, that will read my anſwer. But firſt I will propound certaine teſtimonies of the Fathers concerning the infallibility &amp; ſufficiency of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>VVhen hereſie</hi> (ſaith <note n="a" place="margin">

Now to your concluſion.</p>
                  <p>The firſt part of this firſt concluſion is falſe, in regard of the infallibilitie of Scripture: which it ſhould ſeeme you ſaw well enough, and therefore balkt that matter, and deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed an other point, concerning our tranſlation, to play with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. For what is it but trifling, when a man leaues the thing in queſtion, and buſies him ſelfe about the refuting of that, which beſides himſelfe, no man euer dreamed of? What Engliſh proteſtant euer affirmed, that our tranſlation was <hi>infallible,</hi> that is, ſuch as had no error in it, or might not be doubted of? Or who euer tooke it for the rule of faith? You make babies, which you beate as you liſt. Againſt <hi>the Scriptures being the rule of faith,</hi> which we affirme, you ſay nothing. Againſt
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:21012:42"/>
the infallibilitie of our tranſlation, which we grant not to be the rule of faith, you diſcourſe at large; wherein I intreate the Reader to conſider theſe few things with me. That which he ſpeakes in diſgrace of our tranſlation, makes no more againſt it, then againſt all other whatſoeuer. For neither is any tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the language in which the Scripture was written; and no tranſlators euer had any ſuch infallible aſſiſtance by the holy Ghoſt. <note n="m" place="margin">Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the 8000. places Chap. 4. ſect. 10.</note> Sure the author of the vulgar Latin tranſlation had not ſuch help as the Hebrew and Greek originals, which the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations of all the learned Papiſts themſelues declare; <note n="n" place="margin">Pegnm, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablus, Iſidorus, Clarius.</note> Pagnin, Vatablus, Iſidorus, Clarius, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>As for <note n="o" place="margin">Martin was ſet out 1582. Fulks anſwer 1583.</note> Gregory Martins cauils, they were anſwered long ſince by D. Fulke: and I maruell that you can name them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bluſhing, ſeeing neuer a one of you durſt vndertake the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of them, for the ſpace of theſe 23. yeares. Nay, which is worſe, you were not aſhamed, in <note n="p" place="margin">Printed at Antwerp. 1600.</note> the ſecond edition of your Rhemiſh Teſtament, to bleare your blind followers eyes, with a table of hereticall corruptions in tranſlating the Scriptures, as if you had propounded ſome new matter, whereas they were all taken out of that booke of Martins, and had long before bene iuſtified by D. Fulke, without any reply on your parts.</p>
                  <p>You demaund, how <hi>any vnlearned man can be infallibly ſure, that in thoſe places which do ſeeme to fauour our ſect, our tranſlation doth not erre.</hi> I anſwer, that there are better meanes of aſſurance for vnlearned Proteſtants, concerning the truth of our tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then any Papiſt can haue by your imagined authoritie, for your vulgar Latin. Firſt, it is no ſlender perſwaſion to any reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable man, that thoſe places you ſpeake of, if not wholy, yet for the moſt part are tranſlated with the ſame ſenſe in other toungs which they haue in ours; as in Spaniſh, French, Italian, Flemiſh, Dutch. Secondly, it is a great confirmation of the truth, that many of thoſe texts which ſeeme moſt to fauor vs, are the ſame in your vulgar and Rhemiſh editions, that they are in ours. Thirdly, the truth of ours is yet more cleare, becauſe euery man may ſee, that in bookes of controuerſie betwixt vs, our tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſeldome denied by the learned of your ſide, though you condemne our expoſitions. Fourthly, who may not eaſily
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:21012:43"/>
diſcerne how much more faithfull our tranſlation of thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; all others is, then yours; ſeeing we are readie to make tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of it by the originals, the learned on your ſides being iudges: you are afraid of nothing more, then to haue yours examined by the Hebrew and Greeke? Fiftly, in the places you ſpeake of, our tranſlations deſerue the more credit, becauſe we labour to make them plaine for euery mans vnderſtanding, and ſhew how they agree with the reſt of the booke and chapter: wheras your Rhemiſh Teſtament is ſo handled, that an Engliſh man of good vnderſtanding can hardly tell what to make of it, for the very words themſelues in many places, as if you auoided nothing more then plainneſſe. Sixtly, we perſwade all men, as much as we can, to labour for the knowledge of the originall tongues, that ſo they may be able to iudge of our tranſlation: you do all you can to keepe men in the miſt of ignorance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are afraid to haue your corruptions diſcouered. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenthly, though we allow not our miniſters ſuch an infinite au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie as you giue your Cleargie: yet we teach, that it becoms Chriſtian charitie and modeſtie, neither to ſuſpect a tranſlation where the analogie of faith is kept, and the plaine meaning of the holy Ghoſt not manifeſtly altered; nor to reſt vpon priuate conceit, againſt the generall iudgement of the learned, without very euident proofe of error. Theſe, amongſt other, are reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble grounds for a Chriſtian to build vpon, that he may haue ſome good aſſurance of the truth of our tranſlation. Now let vs examine yours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We muſt</hi> (ſay you) <hi>admit an infallible authoritie in the Church, to aſſure vs that ſuch or ſuch a tranſlation doth not erre in any point.</hi> Firſt, this is more then neeeds. For if that authoritie can aſſure vs, that the tranſlation erreth not in any point needfull to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in regard of the ſenſe, it may be a ſufficient ground for vs to build our faith vpon, though it ſhould miſtake ſome words in many points, and the ſenſe too, in matters of leſſe importance. Secondly, though we do admit ſuch an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in the Church, yet may we be farre enough from any ſuch aſſurance. For how ſhall I be ſure, that the Church hath ſo affirmed of this, or that tranſlation? How ſhal I know, what the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:21012:43"/>
Church is? <hi>A company</hi> (you ſay) <hi>of men vpon earth, infallibly taught by the holy Ghoſt, what is the true faith in al points.</hi> Is this teaching co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to euery one of this company ſeuerally, or only annexed to them all ioyntly when they are together? What if all, what if the greater part aſſemble not? Is this companie <hi>of Clergie men</hi> onely, or <hi>of Lay men</hi> alſo? If of them, then belike theſe are none of the Church. But let vs grant that, which (as it ſhal appeare in due place) is neither true nor probable, that the Clergie onely is the church, howſoeuer they may be ſo repreſentatiuely. What aſſurance can any man haue, who liueth not in the time of this aſſembly (I might ſay, in the place too, where it is) that there was any ſuch aſſembly? that the greateſt part agreed to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proouing of ſuch a tranſlation? that this is the tranſlation they agreed to? Eſpecially ſeeing two <note n="q" place="margin">Bellu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Papate</note> Popes, ſince the laſt Conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Trent, haue ſet out your authentical tranſlation diuerſly. Whether of theſe two was agreed on? How ſhall I be infallibly aſſured, that theſe Popes altered nothing in the tranſlation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Councel? Shall I ſay more? What if this Councell vſed not the meanes of examining this tranſlation by the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals? What if moſt of them (as it is moſt certaine) had no skil in the originals? and ſo did but leape after ſome few, like ſheepe, not vnderſtanding what they did? yet the ſhoot Anchor holds: <hi>the Pope allowed of their iudgement.</hi> What if his skil were but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different? <hi>He could not erre,</hi> you will ſay. What was the reaſon, why he allowed that tranſlation? becauſe the Councel examined and approued it. But without him, al they might erre, eſpecially if they did not vſe all good meanes to find out the truth. VVho aſſured him they did? Shall we haue the holy Ghoſt like Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets doue, to come and certifie the Pope of this doubt? This is a matter of fact; and in things of ſuch nature the Pope may erre, euen iudicially. Well, I will deale bountifully with you. Put caſe all this be true. How ſhal I attaine to infallible aſſurance hereof? Forſooth ſome Prieſt or Frier, Ieſuite or other, telleth me, that things ſo paſſed, and therefore I am bound to beleeue it. Then my faith reſteth not vpon the authority of the Church, but vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the credit of him that ſaith, he is ſent by the Church to make ſuch report. Thus it cometh to paſſe, that the beleefe of vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:21012:44"/>
Papiſts is nothing elſe but a perſwaſion they haue, that ſuch a prieſt knoweth what is true, and will not deceiue them with any falſe informations. Tell me not of other Prieſts and Ieſuits conſenting with him, that was thy ſpirituall father: for all theſe together, if there were ten times as many of them, are not the Church, in which onely this infallible authoritie is to be found. And ſo there can be no ſuch aſſurance in any vnlearned Papiſt of the truth of your vulgar, or any other tranſlation. I confeſſe it is againſt both <hi>Charitie</hi> and <hi>Ciuilitie</hi> to ſuſpect a man of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, without iuſt cauſe of ſuſpition: but ſuch fruites grow vpon ſuch rootes of Poperie, that a man muſt needs be either vnciuill in giuing credit to nothing, though vpon neuer ſo good reaſon; or elſe ridiculouſly credulous in beleeuing euery thing that ſhal be told him, though neuer ſo much againſt reaſon. But <hi>the ſpirit of God teacheth and perſwadeth men to beleeue the Church.</hi> Are you they that mocke at priuate ſpirits, and yet are glad to flie to that helpe? Is it not as likely the ſpirit ſhould teach men which is the Scripture, as which is the Church? And aſſure them of a tranſlation, as of this or that mans ordination and prieſthood? If ſuch proofes, as I haue ſpoken of before, will ſerue, wee are nothing inferiour to you, but as well for weight as number, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour. If you ſay, <hi>the Scriptures enioyne vs to beleeue the church:</hi> How ſhall I be aſſured that they are not in thoſe places that ſeeme to enioyne ſuch a beleefe falſly tranſlated? Becauſe <hi>the Church ſaith, they are true in all points.</hi> What if the Church be deceiued? <hi>It cannot be.</hi> Who ſaith ſo? <hi>The Scripture.</hi> Who tels you the Scripture ſaith ſo? <hi>The Church.</hi> What is to be ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, if this be not? It might ſeeme exceeding ſtrange, that euer any reaſonable man ſhould be ledde away with ſuch fopperies: if the holy Ghoſt had not foretold vs of it, that <note n="r" place="margin">2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 11, 12.</note> 
                     <hi>God would ſend men ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould beleeue lies, that all they might be damned vvhich beleeued not the truth, but had pleaſure in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe.</hi> Theſe deluſions poore ignorant Papiſts truſt to, and to none more then to thoſe which are the mayneſt of all, <hi>the authoritie of the Church, and impoſſibilitie of the Popes erring:</hi> to which whoſoeuer firmely cleaueth, can neuer be good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian or faithfull ſubiect in any Church or ſtate whatſoeuer.</p>

                     <hi>Secondly, they faile in the ſecond condition or propertie, which the rule of faith ſhould haue. For the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues alone, in what language ſoeuer, be obſcure, and hard to be vnderstood, at least to vnlearned men, who cannot reade them; and therefore the Scriptures alone cannot be vnto vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned men, a ſufficient rule to instruct them in all points of faith; as is plaine. For locke vp an vnlettered man, and an Engliſh Bible, for a time in a ſtudie, and hee will come forth (I warrant you) as ignorant in matters of faith as he went in, if wee adde no other meanes to instruct him but the bare writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word, which hee cannot reade. And yet vnlearned men may be ſaued; and ſaued they cannot be, without an entire and vnfallible faith: and this they cannot haue, vnleſſe there be ſome certaine rule and vnfallible meanes prouided by Almightie God, meet for their capacitie, to teach them this faith: and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alone (as is now proued) is not a rule meete for the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie of vnlearned men, or apt to instruct them ſufficiently in all points of faith. But what ſpeake I onely of vnlearned men? ſith alſo learned men cannot by onely reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, be vnfallibly ſure, that they doe rightly vnderstand them. For while they vnderſtand one way, perhaps they ought to vnderstand another way: that which they vnderstand plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and literally, ought perhaps to be vnderſtood figuratiuely and myſtically; and contrarie, that which they vnderſtand figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, ought perhaps to be vnderſtood properly. And ſeeing that it is most certaine, that all doe not expound right, ſith the expoſition of one, is contrarie to the expoſition of another; (as right is neuer contrarie to right) how ſhould one be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly ſure, that hee onely expoundeth right; hauing nothing to aſſure him, but the ſeeming of his owne ſenſe and reaſon, which is as vncertaine and fallible, as the iudgements and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of other men, who ſeeme to themſelues to haue attained as wel as he, the right interpretation or ſenſe. Moreouer there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things required to the perfect vnderſtanding of Scripture, which are found but in very few: and thoſe alſo in whom thoſe gifts are, are not vnfallibly ſure, that they are ſo guided by thoſe gifts, but that both they and others may prudently doubt, lest ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>As in the former propertie, hauing propounded your matter againſt the Scripture, you reaſon only againſt the Engliſh tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; ſo in this, that one may be ſome what ſutable to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being to ſpeake of the obſcuritie of the Scripture, you ſhew that it is hard to one kinde onely, <hi>viz</hi> vnlearned men: though you helpe the matter a little, afterward, by auouching the hardneſſe of it, euen to the learned alſo. <hi>The Scriptures</hi> (ſay you) <hi>are not the rule of faith.</hi> Why ſo? Becauſe <hi>they are hard to be vnderſtood of thoſe vnlearned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that cannot reade them.</hi> Is not the teaching of the Church, whereto you aſcribe ſo much, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be vnderſtood by them, that cannot heare? Is it therefore no ſufficient rule? But the Scripture is not ſo hard, as you imagine: no not to them that cannot reade, as long as they may heare it read, and haue care to vnderſtand, and remember what they heare. Yea there are many in England, that know neuer a letter on the booke, who notwithſtanding are able to giue a better ſenſe of many places of Scripture, then ſome of your Maſſe-prieſts, that can read their whole Portuiſe &amp; Seruice booke. Idle therefore and ridiculous is your example of a man lockt vp with a Bible: ſince by hearing it read, though himſelfe cannot read, he may attaine to more knowledge, then many of your blinde guides haue: who for all their skill in reading, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand neuer a word of their Epiſtles &amp; Goſpels, which they daily ſay at Maſſe, like prating parrots.</p>
                  <p>Now for your concluſions inferred hereupon; the firſt, as I haue ſhewed, is falſe, that <hi>any ſuch entire and infallible faith is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, ſo that without it a man cannot be ſaued:</hi> the ſecond, <hi>of the meanes without which, ſuch a faith cannot be had,</hi> is ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true; the third, which denies <hi>the Scripture alone to be ſuch a meanes,</hi> is either falſe, and not prooued by you, or nothing to the purpoſe. Can any man truely ſay, that God hath not prouided ſufficient meanes for euerie mans ſaluation, becauſe ſome men are vnable to reade the Scriptures, which are thoſe meanes? Hath not God done his part, in making all men ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:21012:47"/>
to reade, though many neglect to learne? Therefore if the Scripture be ſufficient for all mens inſtruction, as I haue prooued it to be, for all your ſuppoſed obſcurity: God cannot be charged with want of care, becauſe men are careleſſe to vſe the meanes of their owne ſaluation. But if by Scripture alone, you meane Scripture without any helpe of man; all you ſay is beſides the matter. For no man euer was ſo fooliſh, as to make Scripture alone, in that ſenſe, either the rule of faith, or a meanes of any good whatſoeuer: vnleſſe perhaps you Papiſts, according to the reſt of your ſuperſtition <hi>in Agnus Deis, hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Granes,</hi> and ſuch like, may haue a conceit, as thoſe prieſts (of whom <note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Opus imperf. in Math. hom.</hi> 43.</note> an ancient writer ſpeaketh) had, that <hi>a part of the Goſpell hung about ones necke, may be a preſeruatiue againſt I know not what bodily or ghoſtly danger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You haue vndertaken to prooue, that <hi>the ſcriptures are not the rule of faith, becauſe they are hard to be vnderſtood.</hi> Their hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in reſpect of the ignorant, was auowed by you onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe, that cannot reade. Now for the learned you tel vs, that <hi>they cannot, by onely reading the Scriptures, be infallibly ſure, that they rightly vnderſtand them.</hi> What then? Therefore can they not at all be ſure? Becauſe reading onely will not aſſure them: therefore is there no meanes, whereby they may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured? Call to minde what I alledged before, out of <hi>Ambroſe, Origen, Chryſoſtome, and Auſtin:</hi> who doubt not to aſſure men, that <hi>they may come to the vnderſtanding of the Scripture, if they will vſe the meanes of praier and diligence.</hi> Whom ſhall we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue? Theſe worthies of the Church, ſpeaking alſo vpon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold experience; or you, whom we know not ſo much as by ſight or name? If you can ſo farre bewitch any of your owne poore ignorant ſoules, yet ſure ther is no man of any <hi>indifferent good iudgment,</hi> that will be carried away with this your ſimple authoritie, againſt the ioynt conſent of thoſe famous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines.</p>
                  <p>But you will adde reaſon to your authoritie: let vs heare it. <hi>It may be</hi> (ſay you) <hi>they ought to be vnderſtood otherwiſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot be ſure, they rightly vnderſtand.</hi> Tell me, I pray you, for my better inſtruction, whether you make this doubt of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:21012:47"/>
all places of ſcripture, or of ſome onely. It will not ſinke into my head, that you doe ſo much condemne the ſcripture of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuritie, that you thinke no one place of it, can be certainely vnderſtood. Nay it is vnpoſſible you ſhould ſo deſpiſe the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe, I named er while, or condemne your owne ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie, as to denie, that <note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>Canus loc. Thcol. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 2</note> many texts of ſcripture are ſo euident, that a childe cannot miſtake the meaning of them. Then, that antecedent, <hi>It may be they ought to vnderſtand otherwiſe,</hi> in ſome places of ſcripture can haue no place. Let vs limit it, that the truth may appeare. <hi>Some places of ſcripture are ſo hard, that a man may vnderſtand them otherwiſe, then, in truth, they are to be vnderſtood.</hi> This propoſition is out of all queſtion: what wil you conclude hereupon? That <hi>men cannot be ſure they rightly vnderſtand theſe places.</hi> I grant this too. Therefore theſe doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full places are not to be made the foundation of our faith: but (as <note n="g" place="margin">Auguſt. ad Marcel. de Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſ. paruulo.</note> Auſtin ſaith) <hi>We muſt reſt vpon thoſe places of ſcripture, which are verie manifeſt, that by them the harder may be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi> But admit there were diuers texts of ſcripture, which can by no meanes be certainly vnderſtood (which yet for my part, ſauing other mens better iudgement, I do not thinke to be true, becauſe God hath appointed euerie ſyllable of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for our inſtruction in this life) but admit (I ſay) there were ſuch places; yet would it not follow hereupon, that becauſe thoſe texts cannot be vnderſtood, therefore the ſcripture is ſo obſcure, that it cannot be the rule of faith. For there may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient means of ſaluation plainly diſcouered in the ſcriptures, though theſe places be not vnderſtood: yea it may be, and it is verie likely, that the verie ſame things which in theſe places are ſignified, are otherwhere in ſcripture apparently ſet downe. You will ſay, this prooueth that <hi>the ſcripture is obſcure in ſome places.</hi> VVho euer denied it? But this doth not prooue, that <hi>it is hard to be vnderſtood in thoſe points; that are neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</hi> Remember, I denied that ſecond property of your rule, when I anſwered to your propoſition. A man may be ſaued, though he vnderſtand not the true ſenſe of euery verſe in the Bible; ſo he do not acknowledge it to be the word of God, and withall denie it to be true. But if it be ſo hard to vnderſtand
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:21012:48"/>
the Scripture aright, is it good dealing in you to vrge the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of men, with ſuch pere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ptorineſſe, as if it were an hainous ſinne not to giue credit to euery interpretation of the Fathers? We <note n="h" place="margin">See my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to 12. art. part 1. art. 5.</note> acknowledge their learning and pietie: but we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber they are men, and therefore may be deceiued. Where they bring reaſon for their expoſitions, we conſider of it with reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to them: where they bring none, we trie whether we can bring any proofe of their interpretation. If we finde none, we labour to expound the text ſo, as true reaſon (ſo farre as we can iudge) ſhewes that we ought to doe. Where our weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe affoords no proofe for our interpretation, nor againſt theirs, we are willing and readie to giue more credit to them, then to our ſelues. But it is no diſgrace to them, that proceſſe of time, by Gods bleſſing vpon mens endeauours, ſhould bring ſomewhat to light now, which in former ages hath not bene vnderſtood. <hi>It cannot be hidden from any man</hi> (ſaith your <note n="i" place="margin">

I pray you anſwer me, in good earneſt: Are you perſwaded of your ſelfe (I ſpeake to a Scholler) that you vnderſtand not the true meaning of any one place in Ariſtotles Phyſicks, with the commentaries vpon
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:21012:48"/>
him expounding diuerſly? Surely if your ignorance had bene ſo great, I preſume neither Rome, Rhemes, Doway, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vniuerſitie or Colledge would haue vouchſafed you the degree of a Batcheler in Arts. And yet <note n="n" place="margin">Ariſt. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. ad Alexan.</note> Ariſtotle himſelfe profeſſeth of that booke, that <hi>he ſet it out, as if he had not ſet it out; becauſe no bodie</hi> (for ſooth) <hi>could vnderſtand it, but he, that had, or ſhould heare him teach by word of mouth;</hi> as you ſpeake of the preaching of the Church. If then it be poſſible to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Ariſtotles meaning, and that certainly, for all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers interpretations of his expoſitors, and his owne intended obſcuritie: giue vs leaue to thinke, that the Lord God purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to reueale his will by the ſcriptures, hath written in ſuch ſort, that man his creature, <hi>to whom</hi> (as <note n="o" place="margin">

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is there no meanes to diſcerne, which interpretation is true, which falſe? Doth not this doubt accompanie the writings of the Philoſophers, as well as the ſcriptures? Neuer go about to perſwade vs to ſuch an iniurious and vnthankfull conceit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, as to imagine, that he hath vouchſafed vs the vſe of reaſon, and the treaſure of his word, to ſo little purpoſe. If it be vnpoſſible to know, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue the true ſenſe of the ſcripture it had bene farre better, that no ſcripture had bene written, but all left to the direction of your Pope, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time. Such blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, as I haue ſhewed, ſome of your ſide vtter: but a true Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is ſo throughly perſwaded of Gods wiſdom, that by his giuing the ſcripture, he ſeeth al theſe your cauils &amp; ſhifts refuted.</p>
                  <p>Now in the laſt place you tell vs, that <hi>there be many things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the perfect vnderſtanding of ſcripture, which are found in very few;</hi> If by <hi>perfect vnderſtanding</hi> you meane an exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all places: that you ſay is true, but not much to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For there is no ſuch knowledge neceſſary, but that the ſcripture may be the rule of faith, though euery text in it cannot be certainly vnderſtood. But conſider a little, that if there be means of attaining to a perfect vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of ſcripture, thogh

they be many, yet by your confeſſion they may be had: elſe are they in vaine, if neither any man, nor all men can attaine vnto them: ſome to one, ſome to more, as it pleaſeth God to beſtow his gifts ſeuerally. If you meane, that many things are required to a perfect vnderſtanding of points neceſſarie to ſaluation: ſee how much you differ from the iudgement of the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>The truth is not hid</hi> (ſaith <note n="q" place="margin">

Are youe afraid, leſt it ſhould come to paſſe hereby, that many matters of faith ſhould be vnknowen? The ignorance of theſe things, cannot hinder a mans ſaluation, and this inconuenience followeth the preaching of your Church, as well as the reading of the ſcripture: For how many points of doctrine are there, not yet decreed of by your Church? How many thouſand places of ſcripture, not yet expounded by it? If then it be no hindrance to ſaluation, for a man to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the truth, in many points and places of ſcripture, <hi>may not the written word of God be the rule of faith, though diuers things in it be not certainly vnderſtood?</hi>

For there be diuers queſtions or doubts moued now a dayes, and thoſe alſo touching very ſubſtantiall matters, which are not expreſly ſet downe, nor determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by onely Scripture. For where haue we any expreſſe Scripture, to proue, that all thoſe, and onely thoſe bookes which Catholickes or Proteſtants hold for Scripture, are indeed Gods word, and true Scripure? This we ſhall not find expreſly ſet downe in a part of Scripture. This point therefore, whereupon dependeth the certaintie of euery point, proued out of Scripture, cannot be made certaine to our knowledge or beliefe, vnleſſe we admit ſome other infallible rule or authoritie, wherupon we may ground an vnfallible beleefe: which infallible rule if we admit, to aſſure vs, that there is at all any Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and that thoſe bookes and no other be Canonicall Scripture; why ſhould we not admit the ſame to aſſure vs vnfallibly, which is the true ſenſe and meaning of the ſame Scripture?

                  <p>Ere I anſwer directly to your ſyllogiſme, I muſt note two <note place="margin">To the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> things in the propounding of it. Firſt, by whom the queſtions you ſpeake of, are moued. If by Papiſts, it is the ſhame and ſinne of your Church, to ſuffer idle and needleſſe queſtions to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, of which there can be no determination but by a Councel, to be held, no man knoweth how many yeares hence, euer or neuer. If you ſay, theſe queſtions are ſet on foote by vs; all the world may diſcerne your vntruth. For we are certainly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that it is not lawfull to accept any doctrine, as a point of faith, which cannot be proued by the Scriptures. But you will ſay, <hi>We thinke they are determinable by Scripture, though indeed they be not.</hi> At the leaſt then, anſwer the proofes we bring out of Scripture, and on our part the controuerſie is ended. You wil reply, that <hi>we will not be anſwered, but interprete Scripture as we</hi>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:21012:52"/>
                     <hi>liſt.</hi> Who ſees not that this is a meere ſlander, ſince we ſtand not vpon any priuate reuelations, but on thoſe rules of interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the fathers, according to the light of true reaſon, haue left vs, as it were by legacy? But this reply is alſo otherwiſe inſufficient. For whereas you yeeld, as appeares by this reaſon, that ſome things may be determined by Scripture; this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection denies that any point of doctrine whatſoeuer can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued of by it; becauſe if that you ſay, be true, we wil in all caſes interprete Scripture as we pleaſe. Secondly, I obſerue another point, in reſpect of <hi>the time.</hi> If the queſtions you meane be ſuch, as were neuer moued till now, and the Scripture neuer failed in any former doubts, which ſeems to be implied in that ſpeech <hi>Now a dayes:</hi> me thinkes there is no ſhew of reaſon to imagine, that ſo many and ſo capitall hereſies, for the ſpace of 1500 years ſhould be refuted and ouerthrowne by Scriptures; and now at the laſt, matters of leſſe importance, and yet as you ſay, very ſubſtantiall, ſhould haue no meanes of ſatisfaction by the like courſe. Doubtleſſe if the Scripture hath hitherto bene ſufficient, it is no ſmall wrong to ſuſpect and accuſe it now of inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, eſpecially <hi>in very ſubſtantiall matters, neceſſary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now concerning your ſyllogiſme, I denie the conſequence <note place="margin">To the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> of your propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What? is the Scripture ſo poore and weake, that it can determine nothing which is not expreſly ſet downe therein? What art, what writing of any man is ſo bare? Are the Scriptures onely, that come immediatly from the author of true reaſon, to be barred of that priuiledge, which all other writings iuſtly challenge? Is not a neceſſary conſequence, according to the rules of logicke and reaſon, to be allowed of in Diuinitie as well as in the Mathematicks, where conſectaries are as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true, as the <hi>theoremes,</hi> out of which they are drawne? Is it not as certaine by Scripture, that there are three perſons di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct each from other, and all three but one God, as if theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie words had bin expreſly ſet downe? But we muſt beare with you in this matter, who learned this ſhift of your great Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Bellarmine. <hi>We ſay</hi> (quoth <note n="m" place="margin">

                     <hi>manners, is not expreſly contained in the Scriptures. Expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained?</hi> To be expreſſed, and to be contained, are (at the leaſt) diuers, if not contrary. But I pray you, who ſaith otherwiſe? Not the Proteſtants doubtleſſe: whoſe opinion he propoundeth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, after this ſort. <hi>They preach</hi> (ſaith <note n="n" place="margin">Vbiſuprae.</note> Bellarmine, ſpeaking of vs) <hi>that all things neceſſary to faith and manners, are contained in the Scriptures.</hi> What is become now of <hi>expreſly?</hi> For pure ſhame he was glad to leaue out that word, though he had craftily ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len it in before. Well, this may ſerue to make good my deniall of your propoſition. <hi>A thing may be determinable by Scripture, though the determination be not expreſly ſet downe therein.</hi> Take not aduantage of my words, becauſe I ſay <hi>determinable,</hi> and you <hi>determined.</hi> For the queſtion is not what is determined, that is, ſet downe in plaine words; but it is ſufficient if the Scripture affoord vs the determination of matters by certain conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, vpon truth therein deliuered. Therefore whereas you adde, <hi>by onely expreſſe Scripture: onely</hi> and <hi>expreſſe</hi> are but meere ſhifts, nothing at all againſt that we affirme: who require beſides <hi>onely expreſſe</hi> words of Scripture, the miniſtery and induſtry of man, to gather and conclude points of doctrine out of that which is written in the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Your aſſumption is true, that <hi>there are diuers queſtions not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">To the proof of the aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</note> 
                     <hi>by expreſſe Scripture,</hi> and yet (as I haue ſhewed) the Scripture is ſufficient for the determining of all points of faith neceſſary to ſaluation. Concerning the particular queſtion, you bring for the proofe of your aſſumption. Firſt you ſeeme to grant (and that grant is as much as we require) that it may be gathered out of the Scripture by conſequence, that thoſe books which we and you acknowledge to be the word of God, are ſo indeed: otherwiſe, why ſay you, that <hi>we ſhall not find it expreſly ſet downe in a part of Scripture?</hi> Secondly, I demaund, as before, who moueth this queſtion? Not the Proteſtants, who account it a kind of blaſphemie to denie it, and of infidelitie to doubt of it. Your holy Church of Rome is ſhe that hath buzzed this matter into Chriſtian mens eares, ſo that religion is thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſcorne to Atheiſts, while you make no conſcience of diſcrediting the word of God, ſo you may by any meanes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21012:53"/>
the reputation of your Apoſtaticall ſea. The truth is, that this opinion is not a matter now a dayes firſt ſet abroach: for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts (ſuch as <note n="o" place="margin">
                        <hi>Auguſt. cont.

But it is new and ſtrange, yea almoſt incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that Chriſtians, and thoſe Diuines, yea ſuch as thinke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion reſteth on their ſhoulders, as the Poets faine heauen doth vpon Atlas, ſhould make a queſtion whether the Scriptures be the word of God or no, and ſo giue men occaſion to doubt thereof.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if this matter cannot be reſolued of by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we ſhall be little the nearer for <hi>the infallible authoritie</hi> you haue deuiſed. Chriſtians need it not, who are already perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the bookes of the old and new Teſtament are the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted word of God: and with Chriſtians onely, to ſpeake truly and properly, hath the Church to do, ordinarily. But it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out ſometimes, that amongſt thoſe which make profeſſion of Chriſtianitie, there are ſome found who are in doubt of this point. If this doubt ariſe in the heart of a man that maketh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of religion, he is to be taught, that it is but a tentation of Satan, and therefore not to be hearkened to. Further, we muſt demaund the reaſons of his doubting, <note n="p" place="margin">

His argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if he bring any, muſt be anſwered, and the Scriptures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uowed by the matter and manner of writing; which is ſuch, as will certainly, if not conuert, yet <note n="q" place="margin">

                  <p>Now at the laſt, you remember your ſelfe againe, and returne to your old ſhift of <hi>Scripture alone.</hi> Which you deuiſed of your owne head, that you might haue ſomewhat to confute. <hi>It is not all one</hi> (ſay you) <hi>to be profitable, and to be of it ſelfe alone ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</hi> And you tel vs, <hi>This is certaine.</hi> Who euer denied it?

                     <hi>This I prooue. Becauſe all this wit and learning, be it neuer ſo exquiſite or rare, is humane, naturall, and fallible: and therefore it cannot be a ſufficient foundation, whereupon to build a diuine, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall, and infallible faith.</hi>

                     <hi>This reaſon I confirme. Becauſe whatſoeuer a man, neuer ſo wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and learned propoundeth to others, to be beleeued, vpon the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly credit of his word, wit, or humane ſtudie and learning: it can haue no more certaintie, then is this his word, wit, and learning. But theſe being all naturall and humane, are ſubiect to errour, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. For</hi> Omnis homo mendax, <hi>there is no man, but he may,</hi>

                     <hi>both deceiue, and be deceiued: and may (if he haue no other helpe, but of nature, and induſtrie) both be deceiued, in thinking that to be Gods word, which is not: or that to be the true meaning, and ſenſe of Gods word, which is not: and may alſo deceiue others, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt being too confident of his wit and learning, he preſumeth to teach others, theſe his erroneous opinions. Therefore the beleefe which ſhall be built vpon ſuch a mans word, and teaching, is, or may be a falſe beleefe: and alwaies is vncertaine and fallible: and therefore can neuer be a true Diuine and Chriſtian faith, which alwaies is moſt certaine and infallible. And this which I haue ſaid of the wit and learning of one particular man: may alſo be applied, to prooue againſt the wit and learning of any companie of men, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no aſſiſtance, but their owne naturall gifts, and induſtrie of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die or reading.</hi>

                  <p>I grant this reaſon and concluſion to be ſound and true: onely in the confirmation of it, I finde ſome occaſion to note one thing for the better vnderſtanding of the matter, we haue in hand. If any man would ſpeake for naturall wit, and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:21012:58"/>
learning in this queſtion, he would not ſay, as the matter is here propounded, that any mans wit or learning were the rule of faith, but that the wit and learning of man might finde out ſomewhat at leaſt in the Scripture, whereupon faith might ſafely be grounded. For example (as I ſaid once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) though it be not written any where in the Scripture, that there are three perſons diſtinct each from other, and all theſe three but one God: yet may a man by naturall wit and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning gather this out of the Scripture, and confirme it thence ſo plainely, and certainly, that any Chriſtian may holde thoſe points as Articles of faith. Not that they are to be taken for ſuch, vpon <hi>the onely credit of his word,</hi> (which is a ſecond thing, wherein you miſtake the matter) but becauſe, though <hi>euerie man be a lier;</hi> yet a man may ſee and ſhew a truth, which can<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>not, nor may be ſuſpected of falſhood or errour. And a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, builded vpon Doctrine ſo taught, ſhall be free from poſſibilitie of erring, and as you ſpeake, <hi>infallible.</hi> This I thought good to obſerue by occaſion of your confirmation, where you ſuppoſe, that a man deliuereth matters to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, vpon the bare credit of his word, by reaſon of his wit and learning. In this ſenſe it is out of all queſtion, that no naturall wit or learning of any, many, or all the men in the world, can be the rule of faith, but that, which a man dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth by neceſſarie and certaine conſequence, through his wit and learning, out of the Scriptures, is as ſtrong and ſure a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of faith, as that, which is expreſſed there in plaine termes. VVe may ſee by this, it was not for nothing, that <note n="f" place="margin">

                  <p>
                     <hi>This ſame reaſon I confirme yet againe more ſtrongly. For the rule of faith muſt be able to propoſe to vs vnfallibly, not onely the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and ſeeming ſenſe, but the true ſenſe of Gods word, and the ſenſe intended by the holy Spirit of God, the author of this word; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it cannot be a ſufficient meanes to breed in vs an infallible Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian faith and beleefe, which is onely grounded vpon the true ſenſe</hi>

                     <hi>intended by Almightie God, the prime or firſt veritie, the ſpeaker of this word. But no man, nor no companie of men can by their natural wit and learning tel vnfallibly what (eſpecially in all points of faith) is the true intended ſenſe of Gods word. For as S. Paul ſaith,</hi> Quis cognouit ſenſum Domini? <hi>Who hath knowne (to wit, by nature, art or learning) the ſenſe of our Lord?</hi> Quae Dei ſunt <hi>(ſaith the ſame S. Paul)</hi> nemo cognouit niſi ſpiritus Dei: <hi>thoſe things which are of God, no man hath knowne, but the ſpirit of God. And therefore that knowledge which himſelfe had of diuine matters, came not from any naturall wit of man, but (as he plainly affirmeth) from the ſpirit of God:</hi> Nobis reuelauit Deus per Spiritum ſuum: <hi>God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed vnto vs (ſaith he) by his Spirit. Therefore we may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,</hi> That no one man, nor no companie of men (without the aſſiſtance of Gods ſpirit) can either by interpreting Scripture, or otherwiſe be the rule of faith.</p>

                  <p>I haue made bold to alter your propoſition or maior a little, <note place="margin">To the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> as I perſwade my ſelfe not without reaſon. You make a kind of difference betwixt the true ſenſe of Gods word, and the ſenſe intended by the holy Ghoſt. Theſe two in my poore opinion are all one: for there is no ſenſe of any peece of Scripture to be accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted true, but that vvhich deliuereth the holy Ghoſts mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in that place. The reaſon is, for that the vſe of interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is nothing elſe but to make vs vnderſtand what the Lord meant to teach vs, or to ſay to vs by thoſe words. I deny not, that a man may deliuer true and ſound diuinitie, though he miſconceiue &amp; miſinterprete a text of Scriptures but this is that I ſay, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he teach true doctrine by his expoſition, yet he doth not giue vs the true ſenſe of that word of God, if he propound nor the ſenſe which was there intended by the holy Ghoſt; euerie
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:21012:59"/>
truth of God, is not the true ſenſe of euery place of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>I will not except againſt your Syllogiſme, though you put ſomewhat more into the Aſſumption, then you propounded in <note place="margin">To the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note> the maior: yet let me put you in mind, that both naturall wit and learning can ſhew the true ſenſe of Gods word in very many places; and alſo that by your confeſſion this may be done. Whence it will follow, that in all likelihood of reaſon, many points of faith are ſo deliuered in Scripture, that there needeth no infallible authoritie of the Church to teach vs what is true in thoſe points, what falſe. To anſwer more directly to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; I ſee no ſufficient reaſon, why a man by wit and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning may not be able to vnderſtand, and that infallibly, what is true according to the letter of the Scripture, in matters neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſaluation. I think I may truly ſay, that many a man attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to this knowledge, without any infallible aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt, whoſe principall office it is, ſo to ſanctifie, direct, and preſerue the children of God, that they neuer fall away by any ſuch opinion as ſhal make them loſe their intereſt they haue to the kingdome of heauen.</p>
                  <p>Your proofe, if it be ſufficient, ſheweth your exception, <hi>eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in all points,</hi> to haue bin altogether needleſſe. For if the <note n="t" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16.</note> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in the place alledged, ſpeake of vnderſtanding the true ſenſe of the Scripture, no one place can be vnderſtood by any natural wit or learning. <hi>Who hath knowne the ſenſe of our Lord?</hi> Is not this ſpeech generall, as well of one place as of another? But it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh not of vnderſtanding any or all places of Scripture. For the ſpirituall man he ſpeaketh of, attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not to that height of knowledge, no not in your owne iudgement, vnleſſe perhaps no man be ſpirituall but your Pope. And yet a man may well doubt, whether he be able to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the meaning of the holy Ghoſt in euery place or no, though it be granted he cannot erre iudicially. But Saint Paul thinketh not in that place of interpreting ſcripture. Of what then? Surely of acknowledging or aſſenting to the truth of the Goſpell, concerning ſaluation by Ieſus Chriſt. <note n="u" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Hugo Cardin. ad</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.</note>

                  <p>As before I granted your concluſion, that <hi>naturall wit and learning cannot be the rule of faith:</hi> ſo I now acknowledge the truth of your illation, which you bring in thereupon, that <hi>he which relieth wholly vpon his owne priuate opinion, or any other mans iudgement, can haue no true faith.</hi> Yet muſt I again remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that to rely vpon ſuch opinion or iudgement, is to take that for truth, which is taught barely vpon the credit of the teacher. For otherwiſe, a man may haue a true faith, that is a certain and infallible aſſent to the truth, though he beleeue vpon euident reaſon thoſe points &amp; interpretations, which are proued to him by men, without any infallible authoritie of the Church. But whereas you charge many, or rather all Proteſtants to rely ſo vpon the iudgement of men, I hope you do it without the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of your Church that cannot erre; for I am ſure you do it without any ſhew of truth. No Proteſtant of any diſcretion (not onely not all) beleeueth the doctrine of the Goſpell in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, or any one particular interpretation as a matter of faith, vpon any mans credit whatſoeuer. This reuerence indeed we giue to our teachers, that we rather truſt their iudgement then our owne, and dare not diſſent from them, but where we haue great likelihood of reaſon, at leaſt to the contrary.

For although the doctrine he teacheth be true, yet is it not the rule of faith (much leſſe is he himſelfe) becauſe of his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; but either as you ſay, by reaſon of the authoritie of the Church, or indeed, as we truly affirme, for that it is agreeable to the word of God in the Scripture, called canonical, becauſe it is <note n="z" place="margin">

                     <hi>Secondly, the rule of faith muſt be infallible, plainly knowne to all ſorts of men, and vniuerſall; that is to ſay, ſuch as may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently inſtruct all men in all points of faith, without danger of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: (as hath bene proued before.) But this priuate ſpirit is not ſuch. For first, that man himſelfe cannot be vnfallibly ſure, that he in particular is taught by the holy ſpirit. For neither is there any promiſe in Scripture, to aſſure him infallibly that he in particular is thus taught: neither is there any other ſufficient reaſon to perſwade the ſame. For ſuppoſe he haue ſuch extraordinarie motions, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings or illuſtrations, which he thinketh cannot come of himſelfe, but from ſome ſpirit; yet he cannot in reaſon ſtraightwayes conclude, that he is thus moued and taught by the ſpirit of God. For ſure it is, that euery ſpirit is not the Spirit of God. As there is the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of truth: ſo there is a ſpirit of errour.

                     <hi>Doe not beleeue euerie ſpirit, but prooue and trie them, whether they be of God or no. Neither doth it ſeeme ſufficient, that a priuate man trie them, onely by his owne iudgement; or by thoſe motions, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings or illuminations, which in his priuate conceit, are conformable to Scripture; becauſe all this triall is verie vncertaine, and ſubiect to errour; by reaſon that our owne iudgement (eſpecially in our own matters) is verie eaſily deceiued: and that Sathan can ſo cunningly couer himſelfe vnder the ſhape of a good Angell; and ſo colour his wicked deſignements with pretenſe of good; and ſo gild his darke and groſſe errours, with the gliſtering light of the words, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſenſe of ſcripture, that hardly, or not at all, he ſhall be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.

For ſince the matter deliuered in true preaching, and reading the ſcripture, is all one, vnleſſe it be verie apparent that the holy Ghoſt wil not giue a bleſſing to him that readeth, hauing not opportunitie to heare; out of queſtion faith may come by reading. <hi>Faith</hi> (ſaith <note n="k" place="margin">

                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, I note two things in the propounding of this reaſon: the one that you adde an exception, according to your cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, the other that you ſeeme to giue ouer great force to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.

                  <p>But it is worth the marking, that you preferre miracles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the authoritie of the Church. For <hi>by them, a man</hi> (in your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion) <hi>may haue aſſurance to others, that he is taught by the holy Ghoſt, though he teach quite contrarie to the Catholicke Church.</hi> But <note n="r" place="margin">

For mine owne part (vnder correction I ſpeake it) I am not perſwaded, that euer any true miracle was, or ſhall be wrought, for confirmation of falſe doctrine, how ſoeuer the Diuel may ſerue his turne, by a ſhew of ſuch matters. But it is all one to the moouing of a man, whether the thing done, be in truth a miracle, or onely ſuch in his opinion. Be it neuer ſo true, it may bring no credit to any point of doctrine contrarie to the word of God, in the ſcripture. Yet ſince falſe ſhewes will worke the ſame effect in their hearts, whom God hath giuen ouer to the beleeuing of lies, that true miracles will, me thinkes I ſee no ſufficient cauſe to imagine, that God will employ his infinite power to the countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cing of any vntruth, where no ſuch thing is needfull.</p>

But in thoſe points, wherein the Church ſhall faile of her dutie, the expoſition of the word may giue aſſurance of truth ſpoken by him, that deliuereth the contrarie. But this I ſpeake by way of explication, not of refutation. For I grant your propoſition: So reuelation be excepted, as before. <note place="margin">To the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note>

The doctrine of the Church, is that which the Church propoundeth to be beleeued, whether by word of mouth, or in writing. <hi>Teaching,</hi> if we make it differ from doctrine, is that onely which is deliuered by voice to the eare. If we vnderſtand you in the former ſenſe for teaching by writing, as well as by word of mouth, the latter word was needleſſe; if in the latter of writing onely, then the ſame doctrine written, is not the rule of faith, which vttered by a teacher will become ſuch a rule; not becauſe it is true, but becauſe it is taught by authoritie.</p>

                     <hi>This I proue by this reaſon. If our Sauiour Christ hath promiſed to any company of men, the preſence of himſelfe, and the aſſiſtance of his holy ſpirit, of purpoſe to inſtruct and teach them all truth: giuing withall peculiar charge and commiſſion to them, to teach all nations, and to preach to euery creature: giuing alſo warrant to all, that they may ſafely heare them: giuing alſo commandement, whereby he bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all, to do in all things according to their ſaying: and threatning greatly thoſe who will not heare and beleeue them: then certainly the doctrine and teaching of theſe men, is in all points most true and infallible; and ſuch, as (if the other conditions required in the rule of faith be not, as they are not, wanting) may well be propoſed to all ſorts as an aſſured ground, whereupon they may ſafely build an infallible Christian faith. For looke what our Sauiour Chriſt hath promiſed, muſt needs be performed; and whatſoeuer he warranteth or comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, may ſafely and without danger of error be done, nay muſt of neceſſitie be done, eſpecially when he threatneth thoſe that will not do it: and conſequently if he haue promiſed to ſend his holy Spirit to teach any companie of men all truth; it is not to be doubted, but that he ſendeth this his holy Spirit, and by it teacheth them all truth: and fith the teaching of his Spirit is vnfallible, we are not to doubt but that this companie is in all points infallibly taught the truth. If alſo the ſame our Sauiour gaue warrant and commandement, that they ſhould teach vs, and that we ſhould heare them, and do in all things according to their ſaying: we may not likewiſe doubt, but that they ſhall be able to teach all ſorts of men, in all points, the infallible truth; and that all ſorts of men may, if they will, learne of that companie, what in all points is the infallible truth.

                  <p>Therefore the doctrine and teaching of the true Church is the rule that all men ought to follow.</p>
                  <p>I haue propounded this Syllogiſme, as your ſelfe haue ſet it <note place="margin">Of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> downe, ſaue onely that I haue endeuored to make it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſhorter, keeping your ſenſe whole and full.

                  <p>1 <hi>If our Sauiour haue promiſed his preſence and aſſistance of his ſpirit, of purpoſe to teach a certaine companie of men all truth, then the doctrine of the Church is the rule of faith.</hi>

Do not you affirme <note n="h" place="margin">Chap. 5.</note> in this Treatiſe, that God hath appointed meanes of ſaluation for all men, with a

true will to haue them ſaued; and yet verie many, yea the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part are not ſaued?</p>

                        <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 20.</note> thoſe things, that our Sauiour himſelfe commaunded, and therefore their doctrine can be no farther the rule of faith, then they preach according to their commiſſion. <hi>If I, or an Angell from heauen</hi> (ſaith <note n="k" place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame may be obiected againſt the third, and the fifth points: It doth not follow that their doctrine is the rule of faith, becauſe <hi>all men haue warrant to heare them ſafely:</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, <hi>they are threatned, who will not heare and beleeue them.</hi> For firſt, they may be free from danger of erring, and yet not know all points of faith, <note n="l" place="margin">
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.</note> which is made by you one condition of the rule. Secondly, vnleſſe you enlarge the warrant, as farre as the commaundement, in the fourth point, (which is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to confound them) ſo that <hi>they may ſafely heare them in all things,</hi> your conſequence will ſtill be naught.

                  <p>But theſe feeble conſequences might all haue bene omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by you, and your matter as fully prooued, if you had ſet downe none, but the fourth and ſixth points thus.</p>

Firſt I anſwer, that your concluſion proueth not the point in queſtion; becauſe this companie, to which the promiſe is made, is not <hi>the Church</hi> from time to time, but that promiſe belongeth to the Apoſtles, either onely, or at the leaſt principally, in ſuch a meaſure of being taught. The former may thus appeare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Sauiour ſpeaketh of <hi>another comforter,</hi> in reſpect of his owne bodily departure from them, which cannot belong to the Church now, with which Chriſt was neuer preſent in that ſort. Secondly, this ſpirit promiſed, was <hi>to bring all things that Chriſt had taught, to their remembrance,</hi> whom he ſhould teach. But this cannot belong to the preſent <hi>Church,</hi> nor to any <hi>Church</hi> ſince the Apoſtles. Thirdly, this ſending of the ſpirit was performed <note n="d" place="margin">

They that apply theſe promiſes to all the elect alſo (for to any viſible companie of men, I thinke beſides you Papiſts, no man doth) neither make for your opinion; becauſe they tie them not to any companie, but giue euery true Chriſtian his like part in the priuiledge of this ſpirit, and (as we heard ere while out of your <note n="o" place="margin">Gloſs. ordin. vti ſupra.</note> ordinary Gloſſe) leaue ſome truth to be reuealed in the life to come. <hi>I do not thinke</hi> (ſaith <note n="p" place="margin">

Out of which words we may gather, that we are bound in all points to do according to the doctrine of the Prelates of the Catholicke Church, yea, although it ſhould happen that their liues were not laudable but bad. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our Sauiour in this place doth onely in expreſſe words make mention of the chaire of Moſes, in which the Prieſts of the old Law did ſit: yet he is to be vnderſtood to ſpeake alſo of the chaire of S.

                  <p>Firſt I ſay of this ſyllogiſme as of the two laſt points, that if it giue any authoritie to your Church, it giueth the ſame to euery particular teacher. For the Scribes and Phariſes did expound the law of Moſes, not in Councels onely, but euery one ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in the ſynagogues where they were appointed to teach. Therefore if it be abſurd to conclude vpon this text, that euery Scribe and Phariſey was then, and euery Preacher lawfully called is now to be heard, whatſoeuer he teach, ſure no ſuch matter can be wrung out of this place for the Church.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this reaſon maketh the Scribes and Phariſes <hi>the Church,</hi> ſhutting out the high Prieſt himſelfe, and all other prieſts that were not either Scribes or Phariſes: yea it preſumeth (which is vtterly falſe) that the Scribes and Phariſes were ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors to Moſes in an ordinarie courſe of authoritie, as you ſay your Church, that is your Pope and Bb. ſucceed Peter and the reſt of the Apoſtles. Can ſuch an argument proue a matter of ſuch importance and doubt?</p>
                  <p>Your propoſition implieth, that our Sauiour intended to giue rules concerning Saint Peters authoritie, whom you call <note place="margin">Of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> his Vicegerent. Who wold trifle ſo, in a queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſuch weight? Firſt proue his office, and your Popes right to it; and then frame ſuch arguments: otherwiſe any man of neuer ſo little iudgment may find more cauſe to pity or diſdaine your proofe or preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, then to ſtagger at the force of your reaſon. All things in the Scripture were indeed writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for our learning, and therfore belong to vs ſo far as the general doctrine reacheth, &amp; the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular circumſtances are alike. Wherefore I grant your propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, not becauſe of any ſucceſſion, which could not be in thoſe Scribes and Phariſes, being of diuers tribes, and (as your <note n="x" place="margin">
                        <hi>Genebrard. chron. lib.</hi> 2.</note> Genebrard ſaith) <hi>hauing thruſt themſelues into the chaire of Moſes being empty:</hi> but becauſe they expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the law of Moſes

I denie your Minor: and will anſwer to the ſeuerall proofes <note place="margin">To the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſumption.</note> of it. To <note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>Luc.</hi> 10. 16.</note> the firſt whereof I ſhall need to ſay little, becauſe I ſpake ſufficiently of the former part of that text, at the third point. The ſumme is, that this threatning (as the warrant) is not vttered, in reſpect of any Church, or companie, but of ſeuerall teachers, and preachers; and therefore, if we may not conclude from hence, that he, which heareth not euery miniſter, and doth in all things according to his ſaying, is guiltie of theſe crimes; no more is he, that performeth not the like dutie to a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of Paſtors or biſhops aſſembled together. Secondly, if it were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church, yet were not any man to be held faulty in ſuch a meaſure, but he onely, that refuſeth the miniſterie of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and embraceth not the doctrine thereof, as the onely way of ſaluation. Therefore ſaid our Sauiour in the ſame chapter and matter: <note n="t" place="margin">

This may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and doth ordinarily, from an error of iudgement; that commeth alwaies from a reſolute determination of the will. Thirdly, as hearing, ſo deſpiſing muſt be vnderſtood, not ſimply but when the parties to be heard or deſpiſed, preach the truth of Ieſus Chriſt, according to his word. For there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, as I ſhewed in handling of the laſt point, that bindeth vs any farther to obedience, or makes vs liable to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, then the things deliuered are agreeable to the word of God: vnleſſe we do againſt our conſcience. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your ſpeech of <hi>your Catholicke Church,</hi> is but idle, there being no ſpeech, nor thought of it in this place, but onely a charge to heare the Apoſtles ſimply, becauſe they could not erre: other teachers iointly, or ſeuerally, though the latter be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly intended, ſo farre forth, as they ſpeake agreeably to the

Secondly, I anſwer, that Auſtine ſpeaketh here of thoſe points onely which are not determinable by Scripture, ſuch as he taketh the queſtion of rebaptizing heretickes to be, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the words immediatly before thoſe you alledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo a peece of the ſentence by you omitted. <hi>Although</hi> (ſaith Auſtin) <hi>there be no example to be brought out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures concerning this matter, yet the truth of the ſame Scriptures is (euen in this matter) alſo held by vs, when we do that which hath now alreadie pleaſed the whole Church, &amp;c.</hi> Now in ſuch caſes as cannot by Scripture be decided, who would or may be ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, as to withſtand or miſlike the practiſe of the church in all places? Surely <note n="t" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 16.</note> the authoritie of the church is ſo far com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the Scriptures, that it ought in all things of ſuch na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ouerweigh our iudgement, and incline our affection to the liking of that which is agreed on by ſo generall a conſent of ſo many churches in all nations. Therefore that which you gather out of Auſtins words, of following the iudgement of the church in an obſcure queſtion, is to be reſtrained to ſuch queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as cannot be determined by the Scriptures (and thoſe are few or none of any importance, of neceſſitie to ſaluation none at all) or elſe your conſequence will be nothing worth. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin ſaith, that in queſtions not determinable by Scripture,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:21012:87"/>
we muſt follow the iudgement of the church. Therefore we muſt follow it in all obſcure queſtions whatſoeuer. Auſtins foundation will not beare your building.

                  <p>It is not enough for you to teach vs new diuinitie, but you will driue vs to learne new Latin too: Caeſar could make men free of Rome, but not words. <hi>Credere Eccleſiam Catholicam,</hi> to beleeue the Catholicke Church, in ordinary Latin, is to beleeue that <hi>there is a Catholicke Church.

                  <p>Firſt in general for your whole ſyllogiſme, if the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion you <note place="margin">To the ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme.</note> intend, were no other, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that you prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that <hi>the Church is the pillar &amp; grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of truth,</hi> as S. Paul ſaith, there would be no queſtion in this matter betwixt vs. For we haue learned
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:21012:90"/>
to acknowledge the truth of all and euerie part of the ſcripture. But the beginning of this Chapter ſheweth, that you meane, by <hi>the Churches being the pillar and ground of truth,</hi> that we may ſafely build our beleefe vpon the Churches authority: which, as <hi>I</hi> prooued in my anſwer to that Chapter, is no part of the Apoſtles meaning. In this ſenſe muſt we take your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in particular, I denie your Maior; becauſe your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction <note place="margin">To the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> is naught: preſuming a neceſſitie, where there is none: For neither we need to denie that our Sauiour hath ſo promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, charged, warranted, commanded, threatned; neither is there any cauſe why we ſhould falſely interprete the Scriptures: and yet we haue no reaſon to grant, that our faith may ſafely be built vpon the authoritie of the Church. No ſuch thing (as I haue ſhewed) can follow vpon the words of ſcripture al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by you. Therefore we need not denie the promiſes, charge, warrant, commandement, or threatning of our Sauiour, or elſe grant the Church, ſuch an vnlimited authority. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will the true ſenſe of thoſe Scriptures, either enforce or beare any ſuch illation or concluſion, touching the infallible authoritie of the Church.</p>
                  <p>And whereas you thinke to face out the matter, with naming <hi>the common ſenſe and vnderſtanding, either of all, or the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and almoſt of the vnlearned alſo of the whole Chriſtian world:</hi> my anſwer propounding the iudgement of many excellently learned, and ancient writers of thoſe places, prooueth that to be but a vaine popiſh brag, without all likelihood of truth, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſince you, that <note n="k" place="margin">Chap. 1.</note> ſpare not to heape vp teſtimonies of Fathers, when they are needleſſe, and <note n="l" place="margin">Chap. 14.</note> to quote their bookes and chapters, ſometimes for a bare phraſe, alledge not ſo much as the name of any one author, for the proofe of your interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of twelue ſeuerall places of ſcripture.</p>
                  <p>Your proffered ſeruice, in helping vs with this diſtinction, hath more ſhew of kindneſſe, then good meaning. For it is not brought in, to confirme our anſwer, but to giue your ſelfe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of vttering that, which you are taught to vrge for proofe of this queſtion. But we neither need your aide, and haue good
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:21012:90"/>
cauſe to ſuſpect your fauours. In a word, your diſtinction is ſuch as none of vs euer brought, or would bring to anſwer thoſe places of ſcripture. We confeſſe, that whatſoeuer was promiſed to the Church in thoſe texts, was promiſed for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance to the end of the world: but we ſay, that the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was not concerning the Churches not erring, the three laſt are particular to the Apoſtles, at leaſt for ſuch a meaſure of teaching. But what ſhould I repeat that, which was deliuered in the verie laſt Chapter? The thing you harpe vpon, though vntunably, is, that your Romiſh church, or rather the Church of the Eaſt &amp; Weſt, were indeed the pillar and ground of truth, for the ſpace of ſome 600. yeares after Chriſt, but afterwards fell away from that ſoundneſſe of doctrine, which before it had cleaued vnto. Such a matter there is acknowledged by our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines; yet no man ſaith, either that the Church erred not, in any point, during that time (for all men know it erred in diuers though not fundamentall, if we may geſſe by the writings of the learned in thoſe ages) or that the Church hath, or ſhall want the performance of Chriſts promiſe, at any time, for a moment. But what is all this to the matter we haue in hand? Well: Let vs ſee yet, what you ſay.</p>

The true Church of Chriſt (which the forenamed teſtimonies of Scripture do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend) was, and is to continue, without interruption, till the worlds end. This I prooue: Firſt, out of the verie words of thoſe promiſes which I cited out of Saint</hi> Matthew, <hi>and Saint</hi> Iohn. <hi>For how can Chriſt our Sauiour, or his holy Spirit, be with his Church, in ſuch ſort, as there is promiſed; to wit till the worlds end, and for euer: and eſpecially, as is ſaid in Saint</hi> Matthew: Omnibus diebus vſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ad conſummationem ſeculi: <hi>All the daies, euen to the end of the</hi>

For if the Church for any time, daies, monthes, or years doe ceaſe to be: Chriſt cannot for theſe yeares, moneths, and daies, be truly ſaid, to be with his Church (ſith he cannot be with that which is not) and conſequently he cannot be ſaid, to haue fulfilled his promiſe, wherein he ſaid, he would be with his Church, all the daies, vntill the end of the world.</hi>

                  <p>The truth of your Aſſertion needeth no proofe, and the weakneſſe of your proofe is a diſgrace to your Aſſertion.

This is but a looſe conſequence: I grant the concluſion, or conſequent, that <hi>there ſhall be a Church alwaies:</hi> but I denie that therefore there ſhall alwaies be one, becauſe our Sauiour promiſeth to be with it, whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it is. Put caſe our Sauiour had thus ſpoken; I will be with you, in your perſecution, all the daies, euen to the end of the world: might a man reaſonably conclude from hence, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church ſhall be alwaies perſecuted, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, or eaſe one day from perſecution?

                  </list>
                  <p>I denie the conſequence of your maior: firſt becauſe the <note place="margin">To the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> Church in this place doth not ſignifie ſuch a companie of men as you by that name vnderſtand; but the congregation of the elect, who by true faith confeſſe, as Peter did, and being built vpon our Sauiour the rocke, ſhal neuer be remoued and periſh.

For hereby it muſt needs be granted, that the gates of hell do preuaile againſt all ſuch Chriſtians, as by perſecution or any violence are taken out of the world. Yea Peter himſelfe, and his fellow Apoſtles, to whom this promiſe was firſt made, found not the true performance of it in their owne perſons, but were ouercome by the gates of hell. Do you magnifie our Sauiours promiſes, that make them faile ſo notoriouſly, euen to the

Apoſtles themſelues? <hi>The gates of hell</hi> (ſaith <note n="b" place="margin">

                     <note n="e" place="margin">Luc Brugenſ. ibi.</note> Brugenſis ſpeaketh yet more plainly: <hi>The gates of hell ſhal not preuaile</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſo that the Church ſhal be ouerthrowne, that is, ſeparated from Chriſt, or</hi>

to thinke it continueth not, vnleſſe it be vpon the earth? May I not certainly conclude, that it ſhall continue after this world, becauſe it is eſtabliſhed for euer?

But that I may anſwer the place to the full, I grant that the prophecie belongeth to the kingdome of Chriſt, euen in reſpect of this world alſo; as it is plaine by the time the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaketh of, namely the deſtroying of the kingdomes of Syria and Aegypt, the remaines of Alexanders conqueſt. And ſo Theodoret is anſwered, who grounded his expoſition concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſts ſecond coming, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a miſtaking of Daniels image, as if that belonged to the Empire of Rome, which was prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of the Syrian and Egyptian kingdomes.

How then ſhould the outward kingdom of Chriſt be ſaid to continue (ſimply) without interruption? Some ſubiects of the kingdome might liue ſcattered here and there, but out of queſtion the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:21012:95"/>
kingdome was not in thoſe times to be found, if we meaſure it by any outward ſtate. I ſay therefore ſecondly, that by the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt in Daniel and Luke, the ſpirituall gouernment of our Sauiour is ſignified, whereby he ruleth in the hearts of his choſen; ſo that no force of Satan or his inſtruments can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſe him of this kingdome, but that it ſhall alwaies continue in diſpight of the gates of hell.

For who would not thinke, by your words, that one part of the controuerſie betwixt you and vs, is, whether the men, the companie of whom is the church, may at all times be ſeene or no; as if we were ſo voide of ſenſe as to imagine, that men could be at any time (except by miracle) inuiſible? Do not your words imply thus much? I pray you conſider them
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:21012:97"/>
a little with me. <hi>The queſtion is</hi> (ſay you) <hi>whether the Church be alwaies a companie of men, that may be ſeene.</hi> If you anſwer, that I muſt adde that, which followeth, <hi>And in ſome ſort plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowen to be that companie:</hi> I replie, that your ſelfe afterward make thoſe two diſtinct parts of the queſtion, when you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound what is meant by <hi>Inuiſible, that no man</hi> (ſay you) <hi>can ſee thoſe men, nor know them to be that companie;</hi> wherein you may reaſonably be thought, firſt to ſpeake of thoſe mens being ſeene, and ſecondly of their being knowen to be ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie.</p>
                  <p>But to make ſhort, and to ſpeake plaine withall; the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of the Churches inuiſibleneſſe is double. Firſt whether a man by his bodily ſight can diſcerne, who they are, that be members of Chriſts myſticall bodie or no? that is, who be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and who be not. This we ſay (&amp; herein you agree with vs) is vnpoſſible: becauſe God doth not reueale this point to men, neither are they able to iudge, who are truly iuſtified and ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and who are not. Secondly the queſtion is, whether the catholicke Church, ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> off in the Creed, can be diſcerned by the ſame bodily ſight, or no: we ſay <hi>it cannot,</hi> becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth none but the elect; you ſay <hi>it can,</hi>

The onely true meanes to make a full end of this controuerſie, is to ſhew what the Church is, of which the Creed &amp; the Scriptures ſpeak ſo many, and ſo glorious matters. This point you haue not once touched, but either ignorantly, or craftily concealed that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt vs, and alledge that for the definition of the Church, which if it were true, as it is euidently falſe, yet is but one priuiledge of the Church, and <hi>expreſſeth not the nature of it.</hi> But let vs leaue theſe matters, and conſider what it is, that according to your former diſcourſe, you are to prooue. Now, that is (ſay I), that <hi>there alwaies hath bene, ſince our Sauiours comming, is, and ſhall be, to the end of the world, a companie of men famous, and viſible in the world, ſo that all men, at all times, may diſcerne, that they are the true Church of Ieſus Christ.</hi> For (that I may, in part, vſe your owne words, as they follow in this

chapter) <hi>if at any time it could not be knowen, then the men, that liued in that time, wanted neceſſarie meanes, whereby they might attaine to the knowledge of true faith, and conſequently, whereby they might come to ſaluation.</hi> Giue me leaue to apply that to <hi>all men,</hi> which you ſpeake of <hi>all times. If there euer were, are, or ſhall be any men, to whoſe ſight the Church was not ſo viſible, that they might diſcerne and know it; then thoſe men wanted neceſſary means whereby they might attaine to ſaluation: which if it were ſo</hi> (ſay you) <hi>how is it vniuerſally true, which is vniuerſally ſaid in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, God would haue all men to be ſaued, and to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth?</hi> Do you not perceiue that your reaſon neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily requireth to haue it prooued, that the Church is viſible, as <hi>at all times,</hi> ſo <hi>to all men?</hi> For if it faile in either of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, your conſequence will follow, that <hi>ſome men haue wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted neceſſarie meanes of ſaluation, and ſo God would not haue all men ſaued.</hi> Therefore you propound the queſtion verie inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, when you ſay, <hi>We inquire, whether the Church at any time be inuiſible, ſo that no man can ſee thoſe men &amp;c.</hi> For though at <hi>all times ſome men</hi> may ſee and know it; yet vnleſſe <hi>all men,</hi> at <hi>all times may,</hi> you haue prooued nothing to purpoſe in this whole Treatiſe.</p>

God to them, whom he hath appointed to euerlaſting life, by faith in Chriſt. For if we ſtrictly preſſe the words, who ſeeth not, that this promiſe hath failed, ſince there haue bene ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in all ages, yea in our Sauiours owne daies, who for all his powerfull miracles, diuine doctrine, and vnſpotted conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, acknowledged neither his Church nor himſelfe?

And <note n="h" place="margin">Lyra, operibus miraculoſis, &amp; virtuoſis.</note> Lyra more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſheweth what works are meant. They (ſaith Lyra) that ſhal ſee them diſtinguiſhed from other men, by their miraculous and powerfull works, wherein the Apoſtles, and other their ſucceſſors ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled the common people, and yet excell them in many things. Now the Apoſtles themſelues, for all their many, and ſtrange mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, might haue bene, and had bene vnknowen, I will not ſay to many men, but to many nations, and the farre greateſt part of the world, if they had not, <note n="i" place="margin">Math. 28. 19.</note> according to their commiſſion, trauelled from place to place, and ſo into diuers countries brought the firſt tidings of themſelues.

                  <p>Secondly our Sauiour hath ordained this his Church to be the light of the world; according as he ſaith, Vos eſtis lux mundi, <note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> you are the light of the world: and to be a rule or meanes, by which all men, at all times, may come to the knowledge of that One, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, entire faith, which is neceſſarie to ſaluation, as hath bene prooued. But how can it be the light of the world, if it ſelfe
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:21012:100"/>
be inuiſible? (Nemo accendit lucernam, &amp; ponit eam ſub mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio. No man lighteth a candle, and when he hath done, ſetteth it vnder a buſhell, where it cannot be ſeene.) And how can it be a meanes, by which, at all times the infallible truth may be made knowen, to all ſorts of men; if it ſelfe at any time, could not be knowen of men? Or if you ſay, that ſometimes it could neither be knowen it ſelfe, nor be a meanes, by which the true faith might be made knowen; then, ſith that I prooued that it is a neceſſarie meanes, and ſo neceſſarie, that without it, according to the ordinarie courſe, there is not ſufficient meanes prouided by Almightie God to inſtruct all men infallibly in all points of faith: Then (I ſay) men, that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at that time, wanted neceſſarie meanes, whereby they might attaine to the knowledge of true faith, and conſequenly, whereby they might come to ſaluation. Which if it were ſo, how is it vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſally true, which is vniuerſally ſaid in Scripture? Deus vult omnes homines ſaluos fieri, &amp; ad agnitionem veritatis venire. God would haue men to be ſaued, and to come to the knowledge of <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.</note> the truth. For how can he be ſaid, to haue a true will to ſaue all men, If he haue not, at all times, prouided meanes ſufficient, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, all men may come to the knowledge of true faith, and thereby, by degrees, to ſaluation? Sith eſpecially, he hath power to prouide theſe meanes: and knoweth, that without theſe means prouided, it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for men to attaine true faith, and eternall ſaluation. For knowing it vnpoſſible, he cannot be ſaid to will it; ſith no wiſe man willeth that, which he knoweth perfectly to be altogether vnpoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and much leſſe may Almightie God be ſaid, to will any thing, which is abſolutely vnpoſſible, conſidering that his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is infinite, and that his will is alwaies ioyned with ſome worke or effect, by which worke or effect, that which he willeth, at leaſt, is made poſſible to be done. VVherefore to verifie that Almightie God would haue all men ſaued, we muſt needs ſay, that he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, for all men, theſe meanes, which be neceſſarie, and without which, it is vnpoſſible for them, to come to the knowledge of true faith, and thereby to ſaluation: One of which meanes, is a viſible Church, of which they muſt heare and learne the true faith; which is the firſt, and a neceſſarie ſtep to ſaluation.

What though our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour call his Apoſtles <hi>the light of the world?</hi> doth he meaue, that they all ioyntly together conſidered, as a companie, are ſo; or that euery one of them (ſeuerally) is the light of the world? If you will haue it ſpoken of them as the Church (and elſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſerue your turne to proue the perpetuall viſibleneſſe of the Church) I doubt how you will be able to ſhew, that they were the light of the world. For they did not enlighten the world by any ioynt act of them all together, but by their ſeuerall prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in ſeuerall places. Neither did they perſwade men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, becauſe they were ſuch, or ſuch a company; but euery one of them taught the doctrine of the Goſpell, and was of himſelfe without relation to all, or any of the reſt, the light of the world in that part, where it pleaſed God to bleſſe his labours, to the begetting of faith. If you ſay, that euery one of them was the light of the world (as doubtleſſe euery one was) then will it not follow, that becauſe the Church is the light of the world, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be at all times viſible to all men. For neuer any one of the Apoſtles was ſo; no nor all of them, as I ſaid before, many

thouſands being taken out of the world, after the Apoſtles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to preach, ere they could poſſibly haue any glimpſe of ſuch a light. To conclude, the Apoſtles were, and the Miniſters (in ſome ſort) now are the light of the world, becauſe by their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, it pleaſeth Almightie God to open the eyes of worldly men, that <note n="a" place="margin">

                     <hi>they may turne from darknes to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receiue forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance among them which are ſanctified by faith in Chriſt:</hi> not as if any, or all theſe muſt at all times be viſible to all men; but that there may be meanes for the ſaluation of thoſe whom the Lord (of his infinite loue) hath choſen out of the world, to be heires of his endleſſe glory.</p>

Was any of theſe a viſible Church? or did the people to whom they preached, either ſeeke to them, as to a viſible Church, or beleeue that they deliuered, becauſe they were ſent by a viſible Church? It is true, that no man (ordinarily) can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, vnleſſe he heare; no man can heare, vnleſſe there be one to preach to him: no man can preach, vnleſſe he be ſent.

                  <p>For the better clearing whereof, we muſt a little examine what it is, for a thing to be neceſſary to ſaluation; then, what profeſſion may be counted neceſſary. For the former: that is neceſſary to the ſaluation of a man, without which he cannot poſſibly be ſaued. Now theſe things are either ſimply neceſſarie, ſo that the abſence of them ſhuts a man out of heauen; or neceſſarie onely in ſome ſort. Simply neceſſarie, on mans part (for in that ſenſe we ſpeake now of things neceſſarie) are, <hi>acknowledgement of ſinne, faith in Ieſus Christ, and repentance:</hi> whereſoeuer any of theſe is wanting, there is no poſſibilitie of ſaluation, ſo long as they are wanting. Other things there are onely ſo far neceſſarie, as that the contempt or neglect of them, ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s a man of ſaluation. Such are the Sacraments and outward profeſſion: both in generall, by becoming a member of ſome true viſible Church, and in particular, by witneſſing the truth, as oft as the Lord ſhall miniſter iuſt occaſion. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this latter kinde of things neceſſarie, we are to know that if we truly repent our contempt and neglect of theſe duties,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:21012:104"/>
and beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt, there is mercie for vs with God, though for want of oportunitie we can neuer come to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of them.</p>
                  <p>Touching the latter point of outward profeſſion, it is (as I ſignified ere while) of two ſorts: either a ioyning of our ſelues to ſome Church profeſſing true Religion, or a bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the truth of God, which we profeſſe. To this latter eſpecially belong the two former places of Scripture alledged by you. To the former, that text which you ſet in the laſt place, as it ſhal appeare by and by. You will aske me perchance, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe two, is the profeſſion you ſpeake of. Surely to ſpeake plainly and properly, neither of them. For it is a conceit of your owne deuiſing, without any authoritie or warrant of Scripture; and namely of thoſe places you bring for proofe of it: yet may it in ſome ſort be referred to the latter, as being a meanes whereby we may auouch the truth of God, whereof we are profeſſors. So then the anſwer is, firſt, that no kinde of outward profeſſion is ſimply neceſſary to ſaluation, as if the abſence of it, were in it ſelfe damnable, though the contempt or neglect of the dutie, not repented of, brings certaine dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Secondly, that it is not neceſſary to ſaluation, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſimply, or in any ſort, that a whole Church ſhould at all times make open profeſſion to the world of that Religion which they hold, and ſecretly practiſe. This is that outward profeſſion, which is meant in your minor: by which conceit you ſhut out of heauen all Churches, that is, all aſſemblies of the faithfull, which at any time haue for borne to caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues wilfully into the mouthes of the bloud-thirſtie and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uening perſecutors, by proclaiming openly their faith in Chriſt. It is too true, that an ouer-great zeale of martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome caried <note n="n" place="margin">

But it is as true, that our Sauiour, his Apoſtles, and the Churches, from time to time, haue beene carefull to hide themſelues from the ſight of Tyrants, when the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell was perſecuted, as farre as their callings, and o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther occaſions would giue them leaue. Indeede they
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:21012:105"/>
they neuer would (neither is it lawfull) denie the truth of God, or themſelues to be profeſſors of it, if they were called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion for it: yet did they conceale, as much as they could, from the perſecutors, their times and places of meeting, and alſo the ſeuerall members of their Churches. To denie Chriſt, or the truth of his religion is alwaies damnable, and without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, bringeth damnation vnauoideably; not to make publicke profeſſion of religion is not alwaies ſo; but then onely, when the Lord, by ſome ſpeciall occaſion, according to the generall dutie of a Chriſtian, or a mans particular calling, thruſteth or draweth him foorth to giue teſtimonie to the truth, by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it, or ſuffering for it. Which your ſelfe alſo after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acknowledge, by the iudgement of the learned, who teach that profeſſion of faith is <hi>ſometimes</hi> neceſſarie to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
                  <p>Now for anſwer to your proofes, I ſay (as before) that the two former concerne eſpecially, the denying either of religion in generall, or ſome ſpeciall truth in queſtion, when the Lord, as it were, calleth vs out to profeſſe and auouch it: as he did the Apoſtles <note n="o" place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 5.</note> in that place, by ſending them abroad to preach the Goſpell. If you (ſaith our Sauiour in effect) or any other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſhall forbeare to diſcharge your duties, by preaching my truth, and maintaining it, if you be called in queſtion for it, I will neuer acknowledge you for mine, in the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. <note n="p" place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 42.</note> The Apoſtles calling neceſſarily required preaching of the word, and for them to haue failed in that dutie, for feare or ſhame, or otherwiſe, had bene to denie their Lord and maſter. Yet were they not ſo tied to this dutie, that they muſt needs continue their publicke preaching, in thoſe places, where per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution was raiſed againſt them, but <note n="q" place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 23.</note> they might flee from one Citie to another: and yet not be counted to denie the Lord Ieſus. As for the Churches, that were gathered by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles preaching, there is neither charge, nor reaſon to be ſhewed why they ſhould bewray themſelues to their perſecutors, by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen practiſe of religion in the eies of the world. Indeed the worſhip of God is not to be neglected, though we cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it without manifeſt daunger of our liues; but there is no
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:21012:105"/>

to their meetings and profeſſion?

the former ſenſe, I denie the conſequence of your Maior. We muſt fulfill that commaundement of our Sauiour, though the whole companie of the faithfull be not at all viſible.

                     <hi>If laſtly it were needfull to be viſible then, that thoſe, which were out of it, might ioyne themſelues vnto it, and become members of it; thereby to participate the graces and benedictions, which Chriſt our Lord communicated onely to it; and to eſcape the deluge of eternall damnation, wherewith all was ſure to be drowned, that were found out of it, as it were, out of another</hi> Noe <hi>his</hi> Arke: <hi>this reaſon alſo requireth and vrgeth, that the Church muſt be viſible now, and at all other times. For if, at any time, it were not viſible; how could men, that were out of it, come vnto it? Or how could they attaine ſaluation, if they did not enter into it? Sith at all times, the merits and fruits of Chriſts paſſion are incloſed in it: and the means of ſaluation, and to eſcape eternall damnation, are onely found in it. The Church therefore is viſible at all times.

Who denies this concluſion? or what do you get by it? The <note place="margin">To the Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme.</note> queſtion is, <hi>whether the Church of Chriſt be alwayes viſible to all men,</hi> or no. You conclude, that it is now viſible, ſpeaking nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all men, nor of all times; in which two points the whole controuerſie betwixt vs lieth: ſaue that we alſo denie that there is any ſuch one Church, as you fondly ſuppoſe, without any ſhew of proofe. But that I may let nothing paſſe which is worth the anſwering, I will apply this argument of yours, as directly to the queſtion as I can. To ſpeake plaine to euery mans vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: the doubt is, whether <hi>there be not at all times ſome one companie of Chriſtians or other, that maketh publicke profeſſion of religion, ſo that all men whatſoeuer and whereſoeuer, may take notice of them, as the true Church of Chriſt,</hi> or no. In this queſtion we differ from you in two points. Firſt we ſay, that there neuer was any ſuch companie in the world, that could be knowne to all men. Secondly we adde farther, that euery true Church may be ſo oppreſt and driuen into a corner, that it can be diſcerned by none but the members of it; and yet may continue in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of religion by the miniſtery of the word, ſacraments and cenſures. Now then, I thus frame your reaſon, for proofe of the queſtion.</p>

                     <item>If at any time there were a company of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> viſible to all the world, and no reaſon can be ſhewed why there ſhould at that time be ſuch a companie, and not at all other times alſo; then there hath bene alwayes, is now, and ſhall be for euer ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie viſible to all men.</item>
                     <item>But there was once ſuch a companie viſible to all men, and no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be ſhewed, why there ſhould be at any time, and not at all times.</item>

The ground of my deniall, is, that God hath not reuealed to men the reaſon of all
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:21012:109"/>
his decrees and actions. Your Pope himſelfe (as preſumptuous as he is) I thinke, dares not vndertake to declare or determine, why many things fall out, which we ſee dayly come to paſſe. I preſume all this while, that you denie this poſſibilitie of giuing a reaſon, to men onely, not to God alſo: for elſe your minor wil want little of blaſphemie.</p>
                  <p>Your minor hath two parts, and it is falſe in both. For neither <note place="margin">To the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note> was the Church (as you ſpeake) in the Apoſtles time viſible to all men; and there may be ſome reaſon, why though it had bin ſo then, yet it ſhould not continue ſo alwayes. Of the former I haue ſaid enough heretofore; and it is a conceit without truth or likelihood, that all the world might take knowledge of the Church, when it began in Ieruſalem. For the other point, though I might ſtand vpon it, and put you to proue, that there can no reaſon be giuen; yet will I endeuour for your better ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, if it may be, to ſhew ſome reaſons why it muſt needs be viſible in the beginning (yet was it not then viſible to all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) and need not be ſo at all times. But firſt let vs examine your proofe. I will propound your reaſon in a ſyllogiſme, and then anſwer to it.</p>

                  <p>I do purpoſely omit the former part of the Aſſumption, that the Church was viſible to all men, becauſe I ſpake ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently of it before, and it wil but hinder the examining of this ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme. To which that I may anſwer orderly and plainly, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">To the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> the conſequence of the maior. Although theſe three had bin ſome of the reaſons (whether they be or no, we will conſider in the Aſſumption) why the Church at the firſt muſt needs be
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:21012:109"/>
viſible: and theſe reaſons ſtill continue: yet would it not follow, that then no reaſon can be ſhewed, why it ſhould be viſible then, and not ſo alwayes. For there may and ſhall be other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons giuen of the neceſſitie of viſibilitie in thoſe times.</p>
                  <p>Your minor alſo is falſe. Neuer a one of the three alledged <note place="margin">To the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note> by you, is any neceſſary reaſon of the Churches viſibilitie in the Apoſtles times; as ſhal appeare in the handling of them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in firſt I muſt ſpeake a word or two of the definition of the Church, as it is propounded in this place. In the whole courſe of your treatiſe, as I haue noted in my anſwer here and there, you meane by <hi>the Church</hi> nothing elſe but <hi>your Clergie,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>your Bb. aſſembled together in a generall Councell.</hi> Here (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like vpon better aduice) you are content to allow the people alſo for parts of the Church. But to let that paſſe: the firſt fault in your definition is, that you fancie to your ſelfe one viſible v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall Church, conſiſting of all ſuch as you account true Chriſtians throughout the world: whereas you are not able to bring any place of Scripture, in which the holy Ghoſt ſo ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the church. I deny not, that all Chriſtians agreeing in one profeſſion, may in ſome ſort be ſaid to be of one church: but that <hi>the Church</hi> whereof the Scripture ſpeaks, and of which we therefore muſt ſpeake, if we will ſpeake to any purpoſe, is to be conceiued as <hi>any one ſuch ſocietie.</hi> The ſame word, the ſame ſacraments, the ſame kind of gouerners may be in diuers chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and yet not all theſe be one ſocietie. We may imagine the like in common wealths or kingdomes, that ſeuerall ſtates may haue the ſame kind of lawes, cuſtomes and magiſtrates, and yet not be all one kingdome or common wealth. Your ſecond fault is, that vndertaking to define the true church, you content your ſelfe with <hi>the ſame faith, and the ſame ſacraments:</hi> whereas no company nor man can be of that church, but they that hold the true faith of Chriſt, and the right vſe of the ſacraments. The third thing I will obſerue, is rather by way of explication, then of refutation: you require the gouernment of lawfull paſtors, as a thing eſſentiall to the church. If you ſpeake of that church, to which our Sauiour makes thoſe goodly promiſes <note n="ſ" place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 28. 20.</note> in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, it may be for a time without ſuch gouerners: the promiſes
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:21012:110"/>
themſelues not concerning the whole bodie, in reſpect of their lawfull Paſtors, but euery particular, in regard of his faith in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. And indeed, howſoeuer it be true, that to the being of a Church, as it is commonly taken, it is neceſſary that there be both a paſtor and a people: yet a people depriued of their paſtors by what meanes ſoeuer, and hauing no dependance vpon any other congregation, doth not ceaſe to be ſuch a Church as our Sauiour promiſeth to protect from ſpiritual and bodily enemies: yea a people ſo deſtitute, hath power to chuſe a paſtor for themſelues, and therefore are ſtill in ſome ſort a Church, becauſe that power is no where out of a Church, but is appropriated to the companies of beleeuers, who make ſeueral Churches, though not properly and fully Churches, for want of lawfull gouerners. In the laſt place, I may not omit to note your craft, in adding to your definition of the Church, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of lawfull Paſtors; as if you would haue the ignorant imagine, that there were certaine Paſtors who had ſome ioynt gouernment of the Church: for example, perhaps your Pope, and his Councell of Cardinals, or a Councel of Biſhops aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by his authoritie, and gouerned by his direction. In this ſenſe we vtterly denie, that any gouernment of Paſtors is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the being of a Church; though we gladly embrace the helpes of Synodall, prouinciall, nationall and generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels. All true Churches properly ſo called, are gouerned by their ſeuerall Paſtors: but this makes them not one church, as long as there are not more, or at the leaſt one, gouerner co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al.

                     </note> the learned of your ſide diſcerning (though you cannot or wil not ſee it) neuer define the Church without relation to one generall paſtor, the Pope of Rome. As for the ſeuerall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, be they neuer ſo lawful, they do no more make their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations one Church, in reſpect of their gouernment, then the Companies of London, becauſe they are gouerned by their Maiſter and Wardens, (ſeuerally) make one bodie, without reſpect of their common ſubiection to the Lord Mayor of that citie. You wil then perhaps demand of me, whether <hi>the Church</hi> be not a meere ſound onely, hauing nothing truly anſwerable thereunto indeed? I anſwer to this queſtion, that <hi>the Church</hi>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:21012:110"/>
is more then a meere ſound, and hath a thing in nature truly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the name, and that in two reſpects. For <hi>the Church</hi> may be taken for the whole multitude of them, that in all places of the world profeſſe the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt: and in this ſenſe it containes all, ſaue the Iewes and the heathen. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Church truly and properly is the companie of the elect, that are called to true faith in Ieſus Chriſt. More particularly it ſignifieth ſuch of the elect beleeuers, as are liuing in the world. And this is that Church, to which thoſe glorious and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table promiſes of our Sauiour do appertaine: though there be alſo ſome promiſes of outward bleſſings, which are common to all Churches and profeſſors of Chriſtian Religion. Now theſe elect thus called, are truly <hi>a Church, becauſe they are a companie linked together in the ſound profeſſion of the ſame true faith, and members of the ſame mysticall bodie of Ieſus Chriſt, vnder the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the holy Ghoſt his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>icegerent.</hi> I do not take vpon me exactly to define the Church, but onely to ſhew in groſſe, what is neceſſary to the being of it; nor perhaps all that, but the eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall point, where in you haue failed, which is ſubiection to one and the ſame Lieutenant and Soueraigne, not to diuers of the like kind ſeuerally, as your definition ſeemeth to require. But of this matter enough.</p>
                  <p>Now I anſwer to your minor, that there was no neceſſitie of the Churches viſibilitie, that it might be ſuch a ſocietie as you imagine. For there haue bin, and eaſily may be ſuch ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which may be, and haue bin hid from all the world, ſaue thoſe of their owne companie. Conſider I pray, what ſhould hinder this. Is it not poſſible for a companie of men to profeſſe the ſame religion, but other men muſt needs be priue to that their profeſſion? It is like enough, that ſuch a company grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a great multitude, and ordinarily. holding the exerciſes of their Religion, will in time be diſcouered: as it fell out with the true Chriſtians in the late perſecution vnder Queene Marie. But this proueth not, that therefore there cannot be any ſuch ſocietie, but the world muſt needs take knowledge of it. Could your deteſtable traitors band them ſelues together in that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous plot of treaſon and murder by gunpowder, yea and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:21012:111"/>
ſo often, and worke ſo hard in the diuels ſeruice, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being deſcried: and cannot God by his prouidence keepe his ſeruants, meeting together for his worſhip, but that Satan ſhall certainly diſcouer them? It is more then manifeſt (how long or ſhort a while ſoeuer they may keepe themſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne) that they may be ſuch a companie, and not by and by be knowne.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond point in the firſt part of your minor is this, and thus concluded.</p>

                  <p>I may graunt you the whole Syllogiſme, in the termes it is <note place="margin">To the Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme.</note> propounded by you, and yet neither I loſe, nor you get any thing. For there is no more concluded by it, but that the church muſt be viſible to the members of it: the Paſtor muſt know the ſheepe, and the ſheepe the Paſtor: Which of vs euer denied this viſibilitie? or what is this to proue, that the Church in the beginning of the Goſpell was to be famouſly viſible in the eies of all the world?</p>
                  <p>In a word then to your propoſitions ſeuerally: you muſt adde <note place="margin">To the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> to your maior, one of theſe two clauſes, either <hi>to the members of it,</hi> ſignifying that the Paſtors and ſheepe could not know one another, vnleſſe the Church were then viſible to the members of it; or <hi>to all men,</hi> meaning that there could not be ſuch mutuall knowledge betwixt the Paſtor and the ſheepe, vnles the church were viſible to all men. In the former ſenſe your propoſition is true, but altogether wide from the marke you ayme at. In the latter you ſhoote right, but a great deale ouer. For though your conſequence by this meanes wil proue true, and to the purpoſe; yet your minor wil be ouerlarge, and your queſtion ſtil remaine vnproued. For it is ridiculous to imagine, not onely to affirme, <note place="margin">To the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note> that the Paſtor and flocke cannot know each other, except all
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:21012:111"/>
the world know them too. Why may not the like be ſaid of the husband and the wife, the father and the children, the maiſter and the ſeruants? May there not be gouerning and obeying, but where all men ſee theſe actions performed? But I dwell too long vpon ſo cleare a matter. Onely I was deſirous to ſuite my anſwer ſomewhat like to your argument, for the length of it, leſt ſhortneſſe might make your followers thinke it not well anſwered.</p>
                  <p>We are now come to the third point of the former part, which you conclude thus.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>If men, that were out of the church, were to come into it for ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this could not be vnles it were viſible, then was this one reaſon of the viſibilitie thereof.</item>
                     <item>But men out of it, were to come into it for ſaluation, and this could not be, vnleſſe it were viſible.</item>
                     <item>Therefore this is one reaſon of the Churches viſibilitie.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>This is the onely argument of the three, that hath any ſhew <note place="margin">To the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note> of reaſon in it: and yet this alſo is far from any neceſſary proofe. For if in your minor you meane, that all and euery man was to come into the Church for ſaluation, as if God had intended the ſaluation of euery particular man by the publiſhing of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell: your ſaid minor is in that reſpect falſe. For our Sauiour himſelfe <note n="u" place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>giueth his Father thankes, that he had hid the myſteries of the Goſpell,</hi> euen there where it was publikly preached, <hi>from the wiſe and men of vnderſtanding, and reuealed it to babes or ſimple men.</hi> Yea he profeſſeth, that there was an eſpeciall act of God his Father required <note n="x" place="margin">

Therefore <note n="y" place="margin">

                     <hi>this ſtone aboue, and that below, each of them hauing a like fitneſſe to each place.</hi> But if by <hi>men,</hi> you vnderſtand thoſe men that were choſen of God to euerlaſting life, <note n="z" place="margin">

For there was no neceſſitie of the viſibilitie of the Church to that purpoſe, as if God could not otherwiſe haue procured that they ſhould beleeue and be ſaued: I adde farther, that the meanes which it pleaſed God to vſe, for the conuerting of thoſe that were then to be ſaued, and ordinarily for publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the glad tidings of the Goſpell, was not the viſibleneſſe of the Church, but the preaching of his Apoſtles. So that (as I ſignified before) the greateſt natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the world embraced the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, not becauſe they ſaw ſome viſible Church, to which they might adioyne themſelues, but for the euidence of the truth which ſome one man or other preached to them, without any reference or reſpect to any viſible Church whatſoeuer. <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <p>Hauing thus examined your ſeuerall proofes, I returne now to your principal aſſumption; for the farther confuting wherof, I muſt ſhew, that there may be ſome reaſon giuen, why it might pleaſe God to haue the Churches viſible in the beginning, and not alwayes. To which purpoſe I muſt firſt intreate all men to vnderſtand, that I do not vndertake preciſely to ſet downe the reaſons why God wil haue his churches ſomtimes famouſly knowen, ſometimes hidden from the knowledge of the world. For his counſels are vnſearchable, and his wayes paſt finding out. Farther, I acknowledge in all truth and humbleneſſe, that I hold the reuealed will of God for a ſufficient reaſon of any thing which he doth will, though I could in my ignorance obiect ſomthing againſt it, which might affoord ſome cauſe of doubting. With this proteſtation I ſay, theſe might be ſome reaſons. Firſt, wheras the means of ſaluation had bin, for a long time, ſhut vp in the land of Iurie, and in a manner, made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Iewes; now the partition wall being broken downe,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:21012:112"/>
the Gentiles alſo were to be receiued into the Couenant; which (to our reaſon at leaſt) could not conueniently haue bene done, vnleſſe the profeſſion of the truth had bene famous and viſible. But when once by this meanes the ſound of it was gone ouer the world, there was no ſuch neceſſitie of continuing vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Churches. Secondly, this viſibilitie was at the firſt the more neceſſarie, becauſe otherwiſe the Iewes, <note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38.</note> to whom firſt the Goſpel appertained, being diſperſed in many nations, could not ſo eaſily take knowledge of it: now <note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>&amp;</hi> 13. 46.</note> they haue iudged themſelues vnworthie of it, and the Lord hath giuen it to vs Gentiles. Thirdly, it was no ſmall proofe of the truth of the Goſpell, and the power of God working by the miniſtery of the word, that ſo great multitudes ſhould ſo ſpeedily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted by ſo weake meanes: there is not alwaies the like vſe of the Churches viſibleneſſe. Fourthly, though the Lord in his mercie, would haue the Goſpell publiſhed to the world, yet when it became generally abuſed to wantonneſſe, that mens eares itched after new doctrines, and eſteemed more of their owne deuiſes, then of the true worſhip of God, appointed by himſelfe; it pleaſed his maieſtie to leaue men to their owne blindneſſe, and preſumption, reſeruing to himſelfe a ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie here and there, whom he kept, as the 7000 in Elias time. Laſtly it was requiſite that the prophecies in <note n="d" place="margin">2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 10.</note> Paul and <note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Reuel.</hi> 17. 1.</note> Iohn, concerning Antichriſt, and his tyrannie, and vniuerſall Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacie, ſhould be fulfilled; which could not haue come to the iuſt height of extremitie, if any Churches, at leaſt in thoſe parts where Antichriſt preuailed, had continued viſible. Theſe are a few of thoſe reaſons, which in the blind iudgement of man, not able to ſound the depth of Gods ſecrets, might be an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of making the Churches of Chriſt ceaſe to be famous, and of keeping the true profeſſors <note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>Reuel.</hi> 12. 6.</note> ſhut vp in the wilderneſſe; till the time appointed by God for Antichriſts decay and ruine approached. Yet did not the Lord all this time, leaue himſelfe and his truth without witneſſe, but from time to time, ſtirred vp the ſpirits of his children, to make the world ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and diſcerne, if they would, that your Church of Rome ſo famous &amp; viſible, was corrupted with many errors, and become
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:21012:113"/>
the verie ſeat of Antichriſt. Thus I haue anſwered your fift rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in the concluſion whereof you adde a teſtimonie of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to confirme the neceſſitie of the Churches perpetuall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleneſſe to all men.</p>

                  <p>Though you ordinarily leaue out that clauſe of the Churches <note place="margin">To the ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme.</note> viſibleneſſe <hi>to all men,</hi> yet I make bold to ſupply it; becauſe I am deſirous to perſwade my ſelfe, that you doe ſo, rather for ſhortneſſe ſake, then in a craftie purpoſe to deceiue the Reader.</p>
                  <p>I denie the conſequence of your Maior: firſt, becauſe that prophecy may be alwaies true, and yet the Church not alwaies <note place="margin">To the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> viſible. For all prophecies in Scripture are alwaies true, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God, and yet doth it not follow hereupon, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatſoeuer is prophecied muſt alwaies be true. It was prophecied by God himſelfe, that <note n="h" place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>the children of Iſraell ſhould be ſeruants in Aegypt:</hi> May I then ſay as you do If this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie muſt alwaies be true, they muſt alwaies be ſeruants in <hi>Aegypt?</hi> I trow not. Prophecies are alwaies true; but true onely, according to the meaning of them: that ſuch or ſuch things muſt be, at the time, and in the manner ſignified by them. If you ſay, your meaning is no more, but that if that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie be true, then the Church is alwaies viſible to all men; I anſwer, that <hi>At all times</hi> was put in without cauſe, and might as you ſee, breed a queſtion in your propoſition.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, taking your Maior in that ſenſe, I ſtill denie the conſequence of it. For <hi>the gates of the Church may be open at all times,</hi> &amp; yet all men neither ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alwaies open, nor know that there are any ſuch gates, or Church. Might not the gates of Mexico, or ſome Citie in the Eaſt Indies, China, or America be alwaies open, and yet none in theſe weſterne parts euer heare of any ſuch Citie? You will ſay perhaps, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet by the gates being open, ſignifieth the viſibilitie of the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:21012:113"/>
Church. It is not enough to ſay ſo, vnleſſe you prooue it too. But that I may yeeld ſomewhat of my right in this caſe, and not put you to your proofes in ſo hard a matter: I anſwer with <note n="i" place="margin">
                        <hi>Auguſt. de ciuit. dei lib.</hi> 20 <hi>cap.</hi> 68.</note> Auſtin ſpeaking of ſuch prophecies and promiſes, that this place belongeth properly <hi>to the Church of the elect, into which, without any restraint, many of the Gentiles do enter continually from day to day,</hi> by their actuall beleeuing truly in Ieſus Chriſt. Which anſwer may the better appeare to be true, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that this promiſe is made to the Iewes, whoſe Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates muſt alwaies ſtand ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to entertain the Gentiles coming vnto it. But this can no way be true of the outward Church of the Iewes, which then floriſhed in Ieruſalem, &amp; was vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed ſome fortie yeares after our Sauiours aſcenſion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt belong to that remnant of Iſrael, <note n="k" place="margin">

                     <hi>which is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the election of grace.</hi> Do not replie to this anſwer, that the gates of this Church were alwaies open, euen before our Sauiours coming. For this Church, in reſpect of the Gentiles, had not a gate then, but a little wicket, which ſtood not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies open, but was opened now and then, vpon occaſion, when it pleaſed God, to bring ſome one or other of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, extraordinarily to ſaluation, by the acknowledging of the Meſſiah to come. Theſe gates are now, &amp; haue bene this 1500 yeares and vpward ſhut vp againſt the Iewes: as <note n="l" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10</note> the Apoſtle lamentably coplaines, not, as ſome imagine, becauſe the viſible Church was tranſlated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Iewes to the Gentils, which Paul would neuer ſo ambitiouſly haue affected, as in reſpect of that <note n="m" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>To be contented to become Anathema, that his countrimen might enioy the glorious ſmoke of ſuch an outward priuiledge</hi> (I ſpeake in compariſon of election to euerlaſting life:) but for that the Lord would giue ouer his people the Iewes, and not chooſe (ordinarily) out of them, heires of his heauenly kingdome, as before he had done. We ſee, and reioyce at the ſight, that the Lord of his great mercie, calleth out ſome few from amongſt that deſperate multitude of the Iewes, as before he did out of the Gentiles, but the gates are now ſet open, for the Gentiles, and a ſmall poſterne for the Iewes.</p>
                  <p>But what if I ſhould grant you, that this prophecie may alſo
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:21012:114"/>
be expounded of the outward profeſſion of Religion, muſt the Church then needs be viſible at all times to all men? The maine reaſon of <hi>the gates continuall ſtanding open,</hi> is ſignified by the Prophet to be this: <hi>That the ſtrength of the nations, and their kings may come into the Church.</hi> But this was long ago fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, by the iudgement of your owne writers. <hi>The ſtrength of the nations, that is the moſt warlike nations</hi> ſaith Vatablus: <hi>which</hi> (ſaith <note n="n" place="margin">
                        <hi>Vatabl. ad Eſay.</hi> 60. 11.</note> he) <hi>was fulfilled; when the Romanes were added to the Church.</hi> The opening of the gates, <note n="o" place="margin">Lyra. ibi.</note> Lyra referreth to Conſtantines time, and therefore in his iudgement, they were ſhut more then 300. yeares after Chriſt. And ſo farre is he from once thinking on the viſibilitie of the Church, prophecied of in this place, that he brings three other interpretations, and not mentions your conceit. <hi>The gates ſhall be open: becauſe</hi> (ſaith Lyra) <hi>Conſtantine commaunded, that the Church gates ſhould be opened, which before were ſhut, and that new Churches ſhould be built. This alſo may be expounded</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of ſpirituall ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, becauſe the Church is alwaies open, to receiue them, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. And becauſe, ſince Constantines time, men began to flocke to the Church of Chriſt without feare. The ſtrength of the nations was brought, becauſe</hi> (ſaith the ſame Author) <hi>by the example of Constantine, many Potentates and kings came to the faith of Chriſt.

Concerning the former, we denie the viſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the Church, as it is vnderſtood in thoſe places, where our Sauiour promiſeth ſpirituall graces to it, and as it is taken in the Creed; becauſe that Church is the myſticall bodie of Chriſt, and therefore can conſiſt of none but thoſe, that are truly iuſtified and ſanctified, as none but the elect are. But we farther denie the ſame viſibilitie, becauſe you would haue vs beleeue that <hi>the Catholicke Church is viſible.</hi> To which we anſwer, that this <hi>Catholickneſſe</hi> (let the Church be what it will) maketh it inuiſible: becauſe <note place="margin">Ariſtot. &amp; omnes logici.</note> that which is <hi>Catholicke,</hi> is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, conſiſting of many particulars: and we haue learned, that vniuerſals are not ſubiect to ſenſe, but onely to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the minde, as hauing no outward ſhape, which can be ſeene or knowen by any of the fiue ſenſes.

It is true that the word <hi>Church</hi> is ſometimes ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally taken, that it compriſeth all ſuch, as make profeſſion of faith in Chriſt, but this is not <hi>the Church,</hi> of which the Creed ſpeaketh, and to which our Sauiours promiſes apppertaine: yea beſides this Church, there is the true Church of Chriſt, whereof he is head, whoſe bodie hath neuer a rotten or dead member, ſuch as ouer many, perhaps the greateſt part of them, that make profeſſion of beleefe, commonly are. In a word, the whole courſe of your Treatiſe failes in this point, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the word <hi>Church</hi> is diuerſly taken, you apply that to it, in the generall meaning of the word, which was ſpoken of it by our Sauiour, the Prophets and Apoſtles, in that ſpeciall ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, by which it containeth none but the elect.</p>
                  <p>To your proofe I anſwer farther. Firſt that the word <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>Origen. in Mat. hom.</hi> 30.</note> Origens teſtimonie, that he ſpeakes not of the Churches viſibilitie, but affirmes <hi>that the truth</hi> (which is the brightneſſe or light he mentions) <hi>is in the Churches euery where, East and Weſt.</hi> That this is his meaning, it is plaine by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of that homily, and the whole courſe of it, to the very place you alledge. Origen expounds there that place of the Goſpell, <hi>As the lightning cometh out of the Eaſt.</hi> This expoſition begins thus. <hi>We must know</hi> (ſaith Origen) <hi>that the brightneſſe of the truth doth not appeare in one place of Scripture, and cannot be defended by another, but that it may be maintained out of all parts of Scripture, the Law, the Prophets, the Gospels, and the Apoſtles writings. And this truth ariſing from the Eaſt, that is, the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Chriſt, ſhineth to the very time of his paſſion, in which was his ſetting or fall.</hi> A little after: <hi>We may alſo thus vnderſtand it, that Chriſt appeared to be the word, and the truth, and wiſedome, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning of the creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world, to the laſt writing of the Apoſtles, that is from Geneſis to the Apoſtles books; after which there are none of like authoritie or beleef.</hi> Or thus, <hi>that the Law and the Prophets continued till Iohn, in whom the brightneſſe of truth was. The East was the Law: the Weſt, Iohn, the end of the Law. Now onely the Church neither takes away the word and ſenſe of this brightneſſe, nor addes any thing elſe as propheticall.</hi> The place you bring, lieth thus: <hi>Euery doctrine profeſſing it ſelfe to be truth, when it is not truth, either among the Gentiles, or among the Barbarians, is in ſome ſort Antichrist, going about to ſeduce, as truth, and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer</hi>

A citie ſtanding on a hill, is the eaſier and the farther to be ſeene; but there is no hill high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be ſeene ouer the whole world.

Yea farther, though we do not vndertake to affirme, that there hath not bin at all times ſome one companie or other of true Chriſtians knowne to them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom they liued, to be profeſſors of the Goſpell: yet we doubt not to ſay, that there can be no ſufficient proofe brought out of the Scriptures, that there muſt of neceſſitie be alwayes ſuch a company: as if our Sauior Chriſts promiſes to his church were not performed, vnleſſe the world might at all times per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue where ſuch a companie were to be found.</p>

                  <p>Your propoſition or maior is in the two next Chapters; your aſſumption or minor in the ſixteenth. In handling the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, firſt you labour to diſproue the markes of a true church, which we aſſigne: and that in Chapt. 14. then you aſſay to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and confirme other of your owne; as we ſhall ſee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, if God will, when we come to Chap. 15.</p>
                  <p>Whereas you expound what you meane by <hi>a viſible Church,</hi> viz. <hi>ſuch a one as may be found out and knowne:</hi> you ſtraighten the queſtion, and auow that which no man denieth.

                     <hi>there muſt alwayes be a knowne Church, the doctrine whereof euery must rest vpon in all matters of faith, becauſe otherwiſe it cannot be vniuerſally true, that God will haue all men to be ſaued?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is indeed a matter worth the enquiring, which companies of them that profeſſe Chriſtian Religion, are the true Churches of Chriſt. For that all are not, it is apparent by your Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Synagogue: and that all true Chriſtians are bound (as much as lieth in them) to become members of ſome true church of Chriſt, it is manifeſt, becauſe elſe they cannot ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily performe the duties of his true outward worſhip, which
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:21012:120"/>
are no where done but in his true churches.</p>
                  <p>If the choiſe of any doctrine not receiued from Chriſt, be ſufficient to make men heretickes, and churches hereticall; what may the world thinke of your ſynagogue, which is not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med openly to profeſſe, that ſhe holdeth many points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which haue not proofe out of the written word of God?

What auailes it, to know, that all doctrine is hereſie, which comes not from our Sauiour Chriſt, if we muſt beleeue that all came from him, which your Pope and his Councell tell vs, they haue receiued by tradition? why ſhould we not rather hearken to <note n="r" place="margin">

                     <hi>The way therefore to diſcerne which is the true Church, is irſt to ſet downe, which be the certaine markes, by which all men may eaſily know the Church: and then to examine to whom theſe markes doe agree. The which, that I may the better performe in the Chapter following, here I thinke good, firſt briefly to note what belongeth to the nature of a good and ſufficient marke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note therefore that two things are required in euery ſufficient marke. The firſt is, that it be not common to many, but proper, and onely agreeing to the thing, whereof it is a marke. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, it is no good marke whereby to know any particular man, to ſay he hath two hands or two eares, becauſe this is common to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and therefore no ſufficient note or marke whereby one may be diſtinguiſhed or knowne from all other. But a marke, whereby we may diſcerne one ſpeciall man from all other, muſt be ſome one thing, or moe, which hee hath, and others haue not. As if hee</hi>
                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:21012:120"/>
                     <hi>were</hi> longer, larger, <hi>or fairer then the reſt; or if ſome others were</hi>

                     <hi>as</hi> long, <hi>and other ſome as faire, yet none were</hi> long, <hi>and faire both, but onely he. The ſecond thing, required in a good marke, is, that it be more apparent, and eaſie to be knowen, then the thing. For example, If I were to deſcribe and make knowen a certaine man, who were otherwiſe vnknowen. I muſt not thinke it ſufficient to giue the definition of his eſſence, or to aſſigne the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret diſpoſition of his heart, liuer, and other inward parts, which are commonly harder to be knowen, then the man himſelfe. But I must declare ſome apparent thing in his face, hands, or ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part of his bodie: or in his voice, apparell, behauiour, or ſuch like; which agreeing onely to that man; and being eaſie to be knowen, may be a meanes to make vs know the man we ſeeke for.</hi>

But let vs take a view of theſe two things, that you require, in euerie ſufficient marke; the former whereof is, that it <hi>be proper to the thing, of which it is a marke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This, you ſay is true, but not ſufficient: For ſome marke may caſually be proper to a thing at this time, which an other time may neither be proper to it, nor belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to it at all.

Perſecution was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a marke, whereby the true Church might be diſcerned: for it was proper to it; no men but Chriſtians being killed or puniſhed for religion.

Therefore euerie ſufficient marke of the Church muſt be ſuch, as is alwaies to be had in the Church, not now preſent, an other time abſent. Generally, to make a marke truly proper to a thing, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired: firſt that it alwaies agree to the thing: Secondly, that it neuer agree to any other thing whatſoeuer.</p>
                  <p>This ſecond property of a marke, that <hi>it muſt be more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and eaſier to be knowen then the thing,</hi> I acknowledge to be true: ſo you tie not this alwaies to outward ſenſe, whereof you bring example. For that greater apperancie to ſenſe, is there onely required, where the thing we ſeeke for, is to be iudged by ſenſe: but it is not requiſite, that in matters which we can not know by any outward token, the marke, whereby they are to be knowen, ſhould be outwardly more apparent: it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, if by ſearch, and diſcourſe it may more eaſily be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>

                     <hi>This I prooue. Firſt, for that by the true doctrine of faith (which they aſſigne for a marke of the Church) either they meane, true doctrine in ſome points onely, or in all. True doctrine in ſome points onely, is no good marke, becauſe the heretickes teach the truth in ſome points. This therefore being not proper to the Church, but agreeing rather to heretickes, can be no good marke of the true Church: becauſe it wanteth the firſt condition of a marke, which is, to be proper, and agreeing onely to the thing, whereof it is a marke. True doctrine alſo in all points, although it be proper (if we ioyne to it the right vſe of Sacraments, with obedience to lawfull Paſtors) and agree onely to the true Church, yet it is no good marke: becauſe it faileth in the ſecond condition, which is requred in a good marke, that is to ſay, it is not apparent or eaſie to be knowen of all thoſe, who ſhould ſeeke out the true Church.

But to know, firſt, which companie is the true Church: and then, by giuing credit to it, to learne which is the true faith, and which vſe of Sacraments is right, there are not ſo many things required, nor any great difficultie, as ſhall be declared.

                  <p>Theſe are the two onely marks, whereby the true Church may be knowen, or to ſpeake more plainely, whereby we may iudge of any companie of men profeſſing Chriſtian Religion, whether they be a true Church of Chriſt or no. For the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnderſtanding whereof, we muſt know, that howſoeuer we ioyne the Sacraments with the word, in this matter: yet we do not thinke them to be abſolutely of equall neceſſitie with it, to the being of a true Church. The true preaching of the word is ſo ſimply neceſſarie, that wherſoeuer it is, it maketh the Church, in which it is, a true Church of Chriſt: and wherſoeuer it is not, there is no true viſible Church. We denie not, that in time of perſecution, many true Chriſtians may be without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie of meeting together, for the true worſhip of God in hearing his word, and calling vpon his name, which alwaies accompanieth true preaching, and yet ſtill continue true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſts myſticall bodie the Church. But we ſay, that theſe men cannot be truly called ſuch a viſible Church of Chriſt
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:21012:123"/>
as we now ſeeke for. Yet if theſe men ſhall ordinarily aſſemble themſelues together, to offer vp praier to God, and by mutuall conference to edifie each other in knowledge and obedience: thogh they haue no certaine miniſter appointed for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of theſe duties: there can no reaſon be alledgd, why they ſhould not be held for a true Church, though not perfect &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete; or why men ſhould not ioine with them, hauing no means to become members of any complete congregation, properly being a Church. The word then, in our opinion, is ſimply ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie: and <hi>of it ſelfe ſufficient,</hi> (as <note n="a" place="margin">Luther. de Concil. &amp; eccl.</note> Luther truly ſaith) <hi>where no other ſigne of a Church can be diſcerned, to conuince a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that there is a true Church, where he findeth the word tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preached.</hi> Now the adminiſtration of the Sacraments is not ſo neceſſarie, but that there may be a true Church without it, vpon occaſion: as <note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioſ.</hi> 5. 5.</note> the Iewes had no circumciſion amongſt them, all the fortie yeares, when they trauelled through the wilderneſſe. The reaſon of this difference is aſſigned to be this: that the word is as it were, the cauſe efficient of the Church, ſo that without it, there can be no Church: but the Sacraments are only ſeals of Gods mercies, and helps for the increaſing of thoſe graces, which are receiued by the miniſterie of the word. Now theſe ſeales and helpes are not requiſite ſimply, to the being of that they ſeale &amp; helpe vs in, but onely to the better being, and increaſe of them. But if I may be bold, with reuerence of other mens iudgement, to ſpeake my poore opinion, I think this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſheweth the different neceſſitie of the word, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, rather to the making of particular men true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the giuing of this or that companie the true being of a viſible Church. And therefore (vnder correction) I would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay, that the truth of doctrine deliuered in the miniſtery of the word, and praier are abſolutely neceſſary, &amp; the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments not ſo altogether: becauſe the former are ſuch parts of Gods ſeruice, as may and muſt alwaies be performed, when the Church is aſſembled, but the Sacraments, neither can alwaies, nor need, at all ſuch meetings, to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred. Which we ſpeake not, as if the true vſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, were not a neceſſarie part of Gods ſeruice, to be done,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:21012:124"/>
vpon all opportunities, with reuerence and willingneſſe; but for that (as before I noted) there cannot be (at all times) ſuch opportunitie. Yea it may fall out, that in ſome true Church of Chriſt, there ſhall be no occaſion to adminiſter the Sacrament of Baptiſme in many yeares. This then is that, which we hold concerning the markes of a true Church: Firſt, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we ſee the word of God truly taught, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments truly adminiſtred, there we may be ſure, there is a true Church of Chriſt: Secondly, that whereſoeuer the former of theſe is wanting, there is no true Church, whatſoeuer ſhew, or marke otherwiſe there be. Thirdly, that whereſoeuer the word of God is truly preached, and accordingly profeſſed, there is a true Church, though the Sacraments vpon occaſion as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, be not there adminiſtred: ſo that they be not neglected, vpon any contempt, or erroneous conceit of their not being neceſſarie.</p>

                  <p>By <hi>true doctrine in ſome points onely,</hi> you may meane that it is not a propertie belonging to the true Church, to beleeue truly ſome points onely, and not all: and this indeed is rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to heretickes, then the true Church, becauſe it is the dutie of all true Churches to beleeue all things that the Lord hath taught in the holy Scriptures; whereas hereticks take vp con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of their owne, which they mingle with the truth of God, either ignorantly or deceitfully.

Yea, I will ſay more; ſome of them are ſuch, if not euery one of them, that a man can neuer come to the certaine knowledge of them by any labour whatſoeuer. And therefore if this be a ſufficient exception againſt the doctrine and ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, why they may not be markes, either you muſt deuiſe ſome eaſier and plainer markes then you haue yet propounded, or do propound any where in this treatiſe, or elſe there will be no certaine meanes to know which is a true church of Chriſt, and which is not.</p>
                  <p>The reſt of your long diſcourſe concerning this firſt proofe, <note place="margin">To the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note> is ſpent in prouing that which no man euer denied, viz. in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming your minor, that <hi>true doctrine in all points is not eaſie to be knowne:</hi> which we all grant, and ſo paſſe ouer to the next point of the ſacraments.</p>

For he may eaſily learne with ſmall helpe, the inſtitution of both the Sacraments out of the Scriptures, wherein all things are ſet downe which belong neceſſarily to the right adminiſtration of them. As for matters

of circumſtance, which appertaine not to the being of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, a man ſhall not need to make any ſo great queſtion, whether they be rightly adminiſtred or no, as long as he ſeeth the ſubſtance kept whole &amp; ſound, according to our Sauiors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: as if the ſacraments were not truly ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and ſuch as may be taken, though ſome matters in the adminiſtration of them, be not ſo well ordered as they might and ought to be.

                     <hi>of diuine myſteries, which we beleeue by our faith: neither doth the Spirit of God (who as the principall cauſe, infuſeth this gift of faith into our ſoules) ordinarily inſtruct any man in the knowledge of true faith, immediatly by himſelfe alone, or by an Angell ſent from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: we muſt needs if we will haue true faith, ſeeke firſt for that which it pleaſeth Almightie God to vſe, as the ordinarie inſtrument and as a neceſſary meanes by which men may learne true faith; the which is no other but the preaching and teaching of the true church, according to that ſaying of S.</hi> Paul: Quomodo credent ei quem non audierint? quomodo audient ſine praedicante? quomodo <note place="margin">

The conſequence of your maior is naught. It doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <note place="margin">To the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> that we ſeeke the true Church, to learne of it as a neceſſary and infallible meanes; becauſe we cannot know the myſteries of Religion without faith, which commeth by the teaching of the true Church: For there may well be teaching and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, without any ſuch authoritie in the Church that tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth.</p>
                  <p>Your minor is very doubtfull, as I will ſhew in anſwering ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally <note place="margin">To the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note> to the parts of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, whereas you ſay, that <hi>no man without faith can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ſupernaturall knowledge of diuine myſteries:</hi> if you meane that <hi>a man cannot acknowledge the truth of ſuch myſteries without faith,</hi> your minor in that part is true: but if your meaning be, that <hi>a man cannot vnderſtand what the meanes of ſaluation appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God, are, without faith;</hi> I take your minor to be falſe. For though thoſe meanes be indeed ſuch, as no diſcourſe of man euer could deuiſe or thinke on, being vtterly ſupernaturall, yet it is poſſible for a meere naturall man to learne what they are out of the Scriptures, and that without faith: becauſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may be vnderſtood by ſuch helpes of the tongues and arts as humane learning doth affoord vs; though to the ſauing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof, the eſpeciall grace of God be abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie.</p>
                  <p>The other point, that <hi>faith cannot be found but by the teaching of the true Church,</hi> may alſo haue a double ſenſe. The firſt, that <hi>faith cannot be wrought in any mans heart but by the preaching of ſome man authorized to that purpoſe by the true Church:</hi> and this as I ſhewed before, is not alwayes true: for faith may be, and hath bene begotten in ſome by <note n="l" place="margin">Chap. 3.</note> the reading of the Scriptures, where the miniſtery of the word was not to be had; and by the teaching of ordinarie Chriſtians, not ſet apart to preach the Goſpell. The other meaning is this, that <hi>faith cannot be attained to, but by our hearkning to the voyce of ſuch a Preacher as we alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die know to be ſent by the true Church.</hi> And this indeed ſpecially fits your purpoſe, but hath no likelihood of truth in it. For they that came to faith by the Apoſtles preaching, did not beleeue them as men autorized for their inſtruction by the true church,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:21012:128"/>
but as being conuinced in their conſciences by the euidence of the truth they deliuered, without any regard or knowledge of their being ſent by the true Church.</p>

                  <p>Concerning Auſtins teſtimonie, firſt, it is manifeſt, that he <note place="margin">To the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note> deliuereth not a rule, for all men to follow, as if by <hi>ſhould not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue</hi> he meant, that a man <hi>ought not to beleeue</hi> the Goſpell; nor ſheweth an impoſſibilitie of beleeuing it, vnleſſe a man be moued, by the authoritie of the Church: but at the moſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, that the authoritie of the Church, preuailed with him ſo farre, as to make him acknowledge the Goſpell for true, which elſe he had either not knowne, or doubted of. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is obſerued according to the reſt of his writings, that the Latine word he vſeth, in the African dialect, ſignifieth <hi>Had not beleeued:</hi> ſo that the ſenſe is, <hi>I had not beleeued the Goſpell, as the truth of God, if the authoritie of the Church, had not moued me thereunto.</hi> The firſt motiue was the authoritie, that is, the learning, conſent, holineſſe of ſo many worthie men, as from time to time had held, and did hold the Goſpell, to be the truth of God. Vpon this ground Auſtin gaue himſelfe to the ſtudie of the Scriptures, and by the euidence of truth deliuered in it, diſcerned that it was the word of God, according to the report and reputation commonly held of it. This ſenſe agreeth with Auſtins purpoſe, who to refute the Manichees, that tooke their maſter Manes for the Apoſtle of Chriſt, thus reaſoneth againſt them. <hi>I beleeue not</hi> (ſaith Auſtin) <hi>that he is Chriſts Apoſtle,</hi> and then demaundeth of the Manichee what courſe he would take to prooue it to him. <hi>Perhaps</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you will read the Goſpell to me, and aſſay to prooue Manichaeus perſon out of it: But what</hi>

                     <hi>if you ſhould light vpon one, that doth not yet beleeue the Goſpell?</hi> Then follow the words alledged by you, <hi>I truly had not belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Goſpell, if the authoritie of the Church had not moued me.</hi> This is yet more cleare, by that which Auſtin writeth afterward. <hi>Firſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we beleeue, that which yet we cannot diſcerne, that being made ſtronger in faith, we may attaine to the vnderſtanding of that we do beleeue, not men now, but God himſelfe, confirming &amp; enlightening our minde within.</hi> But howſoeuer we vnderſtand it, Auſtin ſpeaketh not of true doctrine ſhut vp in the Church, ſo that it cannot be knowne to be true, but by giuing credit to the Churches teſtimonie, which is the point in queſtion: but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of acknowledging the Goſpell, to be the word of God.

                  <p>This Minor, as the former in this chapter, conſiſteth of two <note place="margin">To the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. Part. 1.</note> parts, and is falſe in both of them, as I will ſhew particularly. Firſt you ſay, that <hi>without the teſtimonie of the Church, we could not haue bene infallibly ſure, that there is any Goſpell.</hi> Your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that we could not haue knowne this certainely, but by giuing credit to the report of the Church, as a certaine truth. Firſt, for the doctrine of the Goſpell to ſaluation, it hath bene had, and may be had without any teſtimonie of the Church at all: taking the teſtimonie of the Church as you do, for the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of men publickly authoriſed to this dutie, by a companie of men ſo qualified, as you before deſcribe your Church. I ſhall need no better proofe, then to put you in minde againe of thoſe nations, many and great, who attained to faith and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the teaching of the Apoſtles ſeuerally, without any ſuch argument of the Churches abſolute authority. Secondly taking the Goſpell, for the 4. bookes of the Euangeliſts, I anſwer, that there may be true faith &amp; true Churches, without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thoſe bookes, yea without the verie being of them: as it is manifeſt by the former example, many thouſands being conuerted, and many Churches ſetled, without the knowledge, and before the publiſhing, or penning of them. But to come to the verie point, I anſwer further, that it is a groſſe abſurditie to make men beleeue, that there can be no certaine knowledge had, that there is any Goſpell, but by giuing credit to the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:21012:132"/>
Church: whereas no man can know, that there is any ſuch authoritie in the Church, or any Church at all, but by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Scripture. It is more then ridiculous for me to beleeue, that <hi>there is a companie of men infallibly taught of God, which is the truth, with authority to enioyne obedience to all men, in whatſoeuer they will teach,</hi> if I haue no better proofe of it, then their owne word. For ſince God hath indued man with reaſon, it is both ſimpleneſſe and ſinne for him, to beleeue that, which is vtterly againſt the light of reaſon, if he haue no warrant from God ſo to do. But warrant he can haue none, to beleeue ſuch a conceit of any company, but from the ſcriptures; as it is euident by your own <note n="d" place="margin">Chap. 5.</note> courſe, who make a place of ſcripture the ground of your whole diſputation. Therefore whereas you teach men firſt to know the Church, and then by the Church, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; we ſay this courſe is vtterly vnwarrantable, hauing no foundation, either in reaſon or reuelation. Yea contrariwiſe we truly affirme, that the Scripture muſt firſt be knowne, at the leaſt in that point, of the authoritie of the Church; and then the Church by the Scripture. And this is Auſtins iudgement directly. <hi>Let vs not heare</hi> (ſaith <note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Auguſt. de vnit. Eccleſ. cap.</hi> 3.</note> he) <hi>this I ſay, this you ſay, but let vs heare, this ſaith the Lord. There are the Lords bookes, to the authoritie of which both of vs conſent, both of vs giue credit, both of vs yeeld obedience: there let vs ſeek the Church, there let vs diſcuſſe our question.</hi> And afterward, <hi>I will not haue the Church to be ſhewed by mens doctrines, but by the Oracles of God.</hi> And againe, <note n="f" place="margin">Chap. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Let vs ſeeke the Church in the Canonicall Scriptures.</hi> The like ſpeeches are euerie where in that booke. <hi>Whether we be ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, or you</hi> (ſaith the ſame <note n="g" place="margin">

Yet I denie not that the miniſterie of men is neceſſarie to giue notice, that there are certaine bookes, in which it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God, to reueale the meanes of ſaluation to mankinde; though I acknowledge not any authority in the Church, whereby men ſhould be bound to beleeue this their report, when as yet they are ignorant, that there is any ſuch Church.
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:21012:132"/>
You will ſay then, what ſhall we doe? or how ſhall we know that there is any Goſpell? If you will giue me leaue, I will ſhew you what courſe is to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. When you vnderſtand that there hath bin, and is ſtill an opinion, that there are certaine bookes written by Gods authoritie and appointment, to teach men the way to ſaluation, do as any reaſonable man would do, in a matter of ſuch importance. Get the bookes, reade and ſtudie them, with a true deſire to ſee whether they be ſuch as they are reported to be, or no. And becauſe thou knoweſt by nature that there is a God, and that he onely is all-ſufficient to diſcouer the truth of his owne purpoſe, touching the eſtate of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, call vpon him, though in ignorance and weakneſſe, that it would pleaſe him to direct thee in this enquiry after the means of thy ſaluation or happineſſe. This done, thou ſhalt be ſure to find, by the euidence of truth manifeſted in thoſe bookes, that they are ſent from God, and not deuiſed by man. If thou liue in ſuch a place as affoordeth the interpretation of theſe bookes by the miniſtery of men, vſe that ſingular bleſſing of God with reuerence and care to vnderſtand, and thou ſhalt by the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full teaching of God, acknowledge theſe books to be the word of God, ordained for the ſaluation of thy ſelfe and other. This (will ſome man ſay) may perhaps breed a perſwaſion, that theſe bookes are from God, but how ſhall we come to be infallibly ſure of it? How elſe, but by the worke of the ſpirit of God in thy heart? What (ſay you) muſt we runne to reuelations? <note n="h" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Who knowes the ſecrets of God, but the ſpirit of God?</hi> The truth it ſelfe diſcerned by that light which the ſpirit kindleth in our hearts, worketh aſſurance of beleefe; to which the teſtimonie of the ſpirit is added for our further confirmation. Neither is this any other reuelation, then you Papiſts require in this caſe. For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your doctrine, no man can be perſwaded <hi>infallibly</hi> of the truth of the Scripture, either for the text, or the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but by the eſpeciall teaching of the ſpirit: otherwiſe he hath not faith, but opinion of theſe matters. <note n="i" place="margin">See my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to 12. art. part. 1. art. 3.</note> Onely herein ſtands the difference betwixt vs, that you ſay, <hi>the argument whereby the ſpirit perſwades vs to acknowledge the Scripture, is the authoritie of the Church:</hi> we affirme <hi>it is the euidence of truth,</hi>

                     <hi>knowne the Gospels of the foure Euangeliſts to be canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, rather then thoſe of Nicodemus and Thomas, if we had not the teſtimonie of the Church.</hi> Of the falſneſſe of which opinion, I ſhall need to ſay little, becauſe it is refuted in my anſwer to the former part. For this knowledge is not bred in vs by reſting vpon the Churches authoritie, but by yeelding to the euidence of the truth, diſcouered to our hearts by the teaching of the holy Ghoſt. Concerning the authoritie of the Church in this point, it were a preſumptuous and vnreaſonable thing for any man (without very good proof, or great likelihood of reaſon) to deny or doubt of that which hath bin auouched ſo many yeares by the whole Chriſtian world. But to make queſtion of the bookes of Scripture, whether they be the word of God or no, and to denie that there is any meanes to know them for ſuch, but the authoritie of the Church, is the next way to open a gap to Atheiſme, &amp; to lay open Religion to the ſcorne of the world. Can I not know the Scripture to be of God, but by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Church? How ſhal I then know it at all, ſince it is not reaſonable to beleeue there is any Church that hath ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, but by the warrant of the Scripture? They do all they can, to turne reaſonable creatures into beaſts, who teach vs, that we muſt beleeue the Church cannot erre, becauſe the Scripture ſaith ſo: and yet denie that we can know there is any Scripture but by beleeuing it, becauſe the Church ſaith ſo. This is to dance in a circle, as if a man were coniured, that he could not get out of it. How ſhall I know there is a Church? by the Scripture. How ſhall I know there are any Scriptures? by the Church. Would your proud Clergie thus make fooles of Chriſtian men, if they did not deſpiſe them, as voyd of all reaſon? I wonder how your Pope, Cardinals, Biſhops, and the reſt of your Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, can for beare laughing when they looke one vpon another, and remember how they coſen, and (if I may vſe the word in a matter of ſuch importance) gull the world with ſuch palpable

                  <p>Your propoſition is deceitfully propounded, as if we gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Of the ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme.</note> a companie to be the true Church, and yet would take vpon vs to receiue and reiect what we liſt: whereas we hold that we cannot acknowledge any true Church, but we muſt withall yeeld, that it maintaineth all ſubſtantiall points of Religion, from which we may not vary. Secondly, for <hi>a man to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe iudge ouer the Church,</hi> is to take authoritie vpon him to cenſure, reproue and condemne the Church: wheras all that we deſire, is, that it may be free for vs to diſcerne that the doctrine held by this or that Church, is agreeable to the Scriptures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we acknowledge it to be a true Church.</p>
                  <p>It is meere abſurd and vnreaſonable, to prefer any priuate <note place="margin">To the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note> mans iudgement before the definitiue ſentence of the church of God. But it is agreeable both to reaſon and Religion, that euery priuate man, whoſe ſaluation lieth vpon his true or falſe beleeuing, ſhould conſider whether that which he is enioyned by men to beleeue, be warrantable by the word of God or no. <note n="n" place="margin">

I ſay farther, it is againſt reaſon and Religion, to prefer any one mans iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before the definitiue ſentence of many wiſe, vertuous and learned men; ſuch as the Church hath vſually ſome amongſt the members thereof.

This is that which we teach concerning this matter: Firſt, that no man is bound to take any thing for a matter of faith, but that which is proued to him by the Scriptures, the rule of faith. Secondly, that no man is to condemne any thing held by the Church, vnleſſe he haue euident proofe on his ſide out of the Scriptures. Thirdly, that euery man, in matters not determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by Scripture (none of which are neceſſarie to ſaluation) ſhould yeeld to the iudgement of the Church, whereof he is a member; and euery Church to the iudgement of the Chriſtian Churches other where, vnleſſe there be ſome good reaſon to the contrary.

Now it is moſt certaine, that the ſpirit of the true viſible Church, is of God, as out of holy Scripture hath bene moſt euidently prooued.

                     <hi>whether they are of God.</hi> To this our proofe, you anſwer two wayes: Firſt concerning <hi>the ſpirits to be tried;</hi> then concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>them that are to make triall.</hi> Of the former, your anſwer is, that <hi>this trying of ſpirits is onely meant of thoſe ſpirits, of which men may well doubt whether they be of God or no.</hi> Firſt, this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer cannot be warranted by the text, which is generall: <hi>Trie the ſpirits,</hi> that is, <hi>all ſpirits that come to preach vnto you,</hi> if we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it to the teachers, rather then to the doctrine they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. And ſurely if the Apoſtle had meant as you expound him, he would not haue ſaid, <hi>Trie the ſpirits,</hi> but <hi>trie ſome of them. Beleeue not euery ſpirit, but trie thoſe of which you may well doubt:</hi> but he ſaith generally <hi>the ſpirits.</hi> Secondly, what may we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to be a cauſe of doubting? If <hi>want of lawfull ſending,</hi> which is the great point you alwayes vrge; either we muſt know the ſpirits we may doubt of, to be vnlawfully ſent, and then (by your doctrine) we muſt vtterly reiect them without any farther triall: or elſe the triall we are to make, if we doubt, is whether they be lawfully ſent or no: for till that appeare, we may not heare them. But our Apoſtle appointeth vs to make triall by their doctrine. Thirdly, the reaſon and end of this exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, is, that we might take heede of falſe Prophets and falſe Apoſtles, which were crept into the Church. Many falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were ſtirred vp by the diuell, faining that they had Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall doctrine to deliuer. <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith <note n="r" place="margin">
                        <hi>Didym. Alex. ad</hi> 1. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 4.</note> Didymus) <hi>the gift of diſcerning ſpirits is neceſſary.</hi> Now theſe falſe apoſtles were not ſuch as came without any calling; for the diuell muſt needs haue knowne, if he had bene then acquainted with your doctrine, that it was not poſſible for him to preuaile by men not authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Church; but as the Apoſtle teacheth vs, they were ſuch, as had gone fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amongſt the true Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, not by ſchiſme, in refuſing communion with them, ſo much as by hereſie, in departing from the truth of doctrine, in maine points of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Fourthly, falſe teachers do ſo nearely reſemble true, and <note n="ſ" place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 15.</note> come (many times) with ſuch ſhew of holineſſe, that a man cannot tell whom he ſhould truſt or ſuſpect, but as he findes his doctrine to be ſutable, or contrarie to the word of God. Therefore Ferus a writer of your owne, and one of no

                        <hi>Ferus ad</hi> 1. <hi>Ioan</hi> 4. 1.</note> Ferus) <hi>that we beleeue not euery ſpirit, that is, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery doctrine and perſwaſion.</hi> To which purpoſe he alledgeth alſo that of Saint Paul, <note n="u" place="margin">1. <hi>Theſs</hi> 5. 21</note>

                        <hi>Thomas ad</hi> 1. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 4.</note> Thomas, in the ſame matter. To make this your anſwer the more likely, you tell vs, that when it is certaine that the ſpirit is of God, we neither need, nor ought doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to examine, or preſumptuouſly to iudge of it: as if we thought any ſuch doubtfull or preſumptuous courſe lawfull. Yet in this caſe there is a difference to be obſerued: If we know the preacher to be ſent of God, in ſuch ſort, as the Apoſtles were, that he cannot erre, then euery leaſt doubt of that which he deliuereth, is preſumption and ſinne. But otherwiſe, though it appeare to vs, that he be authoriſed by God, we may ſafely take liberty to examine whatſoeuer he teacheth, without any preſumption to iudge, or needleſſe doubting of that he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth. In a word, if we heare ſuch a man, it is our dutie not to ſuſpect his doctrine, but where we haue ſome good apparence of Scripture for our ſuſpicion. In which caſe we are to ſearch the word of God, and to open our doubts to him, that we may be ſatisfied. If the matter be ſuch, as we cannot clearely prooue to be falſe by Scripture, we are with all reuerence and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to ſuſpect our owne iudgement, rather then his, whom God hath appointed and authoriſed to be our teacher: ſo farre muſt we be from preſumption.</p>
                  <p>Your ſecond exception is againſt <hi>them, that are to trie the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, who are not</hi> (ſay you) <hi>euerie ſimple or priuate man, but the Paſtors of the Church, to whom the office of trying ſpirits doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine; as being put by God in his Church of purpoſe, that we may not be carried away with euerie winde of doctrine.</hi> That this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation belongeth to all Chriſtians, it may appeare by theſe reaſons.

Firſt you alledge breuitie: wherof if you had beene ſo deſirous, you would not ſo often haue repeated the ſame matters. You adde <hi>the ſufficiencie of theſe, their being mentioned in the Scripture, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by Councels, and generally admitted by all ſorts, both Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes and Proteſtants.</hi> All which, taking them in your ſenſe, are generally falſe, as ſhall appeare in the particular handling of them. But indeed the true cauſe is, though you will not be knowne of it, that Bellarmine out of whom you haue patched vp your whole diſcourſe, though he bring fifteene: yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that they may all after a ſort, be reduced to theſe foure.</p>
                  <p>There are two faults in this proofe, whereby you labour to perſwade vs, that <hi>theſe properties are generally admitted, both by Proteſtants and Papiſts.</hi> Firſt, though both admit them, yet in diuers ſenſes; we according to the true meaning of thoſe Councels; you according to thoſe phantaſies you haue deuiſed, for the eſtabliſhing of your Apoſtaticall Synagogue. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we admit them not all as markes of the, or a viſible Church, but as hidden properties of the Catholicke Church, the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call bodie of Ieſus Chriſt, which are not to be diſcerned by the eye of the bodie, but by the light of faith, as all other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles in the ſame Creed are. What though there be no more properties, but thoſe foure there ſet downe? will it follow thence, that <hi>therefore they are named, as though by thoſe onely;</hi>
                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:21012:140"/>
                     <hi>euerie man might ſufficiently know the Church?</hi> Is that the vſe of thoſe points which are deliuered concerning the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt? Or rather, are they not ſet before vs, as principall matters to be beleeued, of them? So are alſo theſe properties of the Church.</p>
                  <p>If any man be ſo ſimple, as to take your former proofe for good, whereas it faileth in the chiefe point you would, prooue by it, as I haue ſhewed; he is fitter to be pittied then inſtructed. But, is it a note of preciſeneſſe, to deſire proofe, for matters of faith out of the ſcripture? Doubtleſſe it was then no leſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeneſſe, to appoint the ſcripture for a rule of our faith; and as great, for our Sauiour Chriſt and the Apoſtles to confirme their doctrine out of the ſcripture. For this courſe of theirs makes vs the bolder to require the like of you, whoſe authoritie we more doubt of: whereas if they had ſtood vpon their priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and neuer troubled themſelues with proouing that they deliuered, or leauing their doctrine in writing, we ſhould eaſily haue perſwaded our ſelues to reſt vpon mens authoritie, and not to looke for any proofe by ſcripture. But giue me leaue a little to conſider of this courſe of yours. The queſtion is, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the true Church be with you or with vs.</hi> You tell vs we ſhall know that, by ſeeing whether you or we haue the markes of the true Church: we accept of this triall. How ſhall we informe our ſelues what theſe markes are? Tuſh (ſay you) for that matter you muſt be ruled by the Councels. Why? but the Councels, as you would make vs beleeue, were wholly for you, and conſiſted of Popiſh Biſhops: what reaſon haue we then to ſtand to their iudgment, in a controuerſie betwixt you &amp; vs? You will anſwer that we ſay, they were not Popiſh. We ſay ſo indeed, and haue prooued it in diuers points, as occaſion hath bene offered. But we adde further, that theſe Councels might erre, you denie it. How will you perſwade vs the contrarie? When all is done, we muſt come to triall by the Scriptures, or elſe take your word for it. And is it for all this, preciſeneſſe to require proofe out of the Scriptures, of thoſe marks you would prooue your Church by? I haue ſhewed before, that there is no means to know certainly there is any Church of Chriſt, or any Chriſt, but by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:21012:140"/>
Are not the Scriptures then the fitteſt meanes to teach vs by what marks this Church may be knowne? The Councels tell vs, what they are. Who told them? the holy Ghoſt. Let it be ſo. But how did he tell them? by ſome reuelation, vtterly beſide the Scriptures, or by truth in the Scriptures? If the former; we aske how we may be ſo perſwaded? The church tels you ſo. Yet again the church? How knows the church that they had ſuch reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? What help now, but about again to the ſcriptures? Thinke not much then, if in this queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the marks of the church, we deſire to be taught by the Scriptures what thoſe markes are; eſpecially ſince (as you profeſſe) you may do it ſo eaſily: but I am afraid you will do it with more eaſe then truth.</p>

If we ſtretch it farther, the chiefe cauſe why the church is <hi>one bodie,</hi> is aſſigned by Cardinal <note n="k" place="margin">Caietan. ibi.</note> Caietan to be <hi>the ſpirit of Christ.

Now in concluſion of this firſt marke, I muſt obſerue a few points for the Readers inſtruction. Firſt I deſire it may be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that whereas <hi>vnitie</hi> is made a principal marke by your wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; they vnderſtand as well vnitie of loue as of faith: you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire but the one of them, and ſo giue vs but halfe a marke. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, let it be obſerued, that this marke is either no marke at all, or all one with ours; ſo that whereas you trouble vs with more then this, you make it much harder then we do, to find out the true Church. In the third place it would be conſidered what you meane <hi>by one and the ſame faith:</hi> I preſſe you with your owne argument, <note n="q" place="margin">Chap. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Continuing in one and the ſame faith, in regard of ſome points only, is no good marke, becauſe heretickes continue in ſome points of truth.</hi> Continuing in all points can be no good mark: for it is not only hard, but vnpoſſible for a ſimple vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man to be aſſured that any church hath alwayes continued in profeſſion of one and the ſame faith, in euery point: yea this is infinitely harder, then to diſcerne of all truth, becauſe the one is to be learned out of the Scriptures: the other cannot be known, but by ſearching the records of the church from time to time. Of the one there is certaine knowledge to be had, becauſe the Scriptures are the word of God: of the other, the beſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance we can haue, is but the teſtimonie of men, that might erre by ignorance or partialitie. Whatſoeuer doubts or difficulties you can imagine concerning the falſe tranſlation or miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Scriptures, the ſame wil accompanie all the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of men, touching the doctrine of the Church in all ages. Then let any reaſonable man iudge, whether you or we ſhew them a better marke to know the true Church by.</p>

Wherefore although euery one that is in the Church, be not holy, yet no doubt, alwayes ſome are: the which their holineſſe, it pleaſeth Almightie God to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie and make knowne ſometime by miracle; and ordinarily he vſeth to make it apparent enough by the light of their vertuous actions, which at all times in many members of the true Church, do ſo ſhine before men, that by it men are moued to glorifie God, and ſometimes to imitate in their owne life that, which in others they admire.

By which place, and diuers others, he ſheweth plainly, that the true Church of Christ cannot be contained in a corner of the world, but muſt be vniuerſall, that is, diffuſed and ſpread throughout the whole world: as the ſame S.

                     <hi>But we must note here, that when we ſay the true Church is Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick or diffuſed throughout the whole world, it is meant, that at least by ſucceſſion of time it hath bene, or ſhall be dilated more and more in euery nation, till it haue gone throughout the whole world.

                     <hi>On the contrary ſide, the congregation of hereticks is not</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, <hi>neither in time nor place. And firſt for time, it is euident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe true doctrine was firſt preached and beleeued, as the good ſeed was firſt ſowne in the field, and afterward the cockle, that is falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, was ouer ſowed. Saint Paul did for three yeares ſpace teach the Epheſians the true doctrine of faith, and had conuerſed among them like a lambe,</hi> ſeruiens Domino cum omni humilitate, <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing our Lord with all humilitie: but after his departure, he ſaid,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 20.</note> 
                     <hi>he knew that rauenous wolues would enter in among them, not spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the flocke; and that euen out of their owne company, there would ariſe</hi> viriloquentes peruerſa, vt abducant diſcipulos poſt ſe, <hi>men ſpeaking peruerſe things, that they may leade away diſciples after</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                     <hi>themſelues. And as this happened at Epheſus, ſo doubtleſſe in all other places, where there hath bin any alteration of Chriſtian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; firſt the true faith was planted by ſome Apoſtle or Apoſtolicke man, and afterward the contrary was brought in by ſome ſpeaking peruerſe things, thereby leading away diſciples after themſelues. So that it is certaine, that no hereſie is ſo auncient as the true faith: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is any one of them of ſo long continuance for the time to come, as S. Paul ſignified, when hauing deſcribed heretickes of the latter dayes, he addeth,</hi> ſed vltra non proficient, inſipientia enim eoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> manifeſta erit omnibus: <hi>but they ſhall proſper no further, for their</hi>

Many hereſies are now already dead, &amp;c. Now if we will haue reſpect of place, it is certaine that no hereſie is by proceſſe of time to ſpread it ſelfe abſolutely ouer the whole world, as I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that the true Church ſhall do, and the reaſon hereof may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, becauſe as S.

So that of hereticks we may wel ſay, as S. Auſtin doth, that they are thoſe which ſay,</hi> Ecce hic eſt Chriſtus, ecce illic, <hi>Behold Chriſt is here, behold</hi>

Wherefore ſith there is this difference betwixt hereſie and true Chriſtian religion, that as the ſame Saint Auſtin ſaith,</hi> Singulae haereſes in multis gentibus vbi Eccleſia eſt, non inueniuntur: Eccleſia autem, quae vbique eſt, etiam vbi illae ſunt, <note place="margin">

inuenitur: <hi>Hereſies are not found in many nations where the church is: but the Church, which is euery where, is found in thoſe nations where hereſies are. This difference (I ſay) being betwixt hereſie and the true religion, we need not doubt, but that to be</hi> Catholicke, <hi>or vniuerſally receiued in the Christian world, especially at all times, is a note of the truth: And that therfore the companie which profeſſeth the faith, which at all times, and in a ſort, in all places, hath bin recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of Chriſtians, is vndoubtedly the true Church of Chriſt.</hi>

But what was the reaſon
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:21012:152"/>
why this title was added to the church? In all likelihood it was firſt deuiſed and applied to the Church, to ſignifie the breach of the partition wall, which ſometimes ſtood betwixt the Iewes and Gentils, till by our Sauiours death it was caſt downe. This I ſpeake vpon this ſuppoſition, that the word <hi>Catholicke</hi> was as ancient in the Church, as the time of the Apoſtles. But if it were brought in afterward (as I could eaſily perſwade my ſelf, but for reuerence of other mens iudgments) we may verie wel aſſent to <note n="q" place="margin">Pacian. vbi ſupra.</note> Pacianus, who writes of it in this maner. <hi>When after the Apoſtles times, hereſies ſprung vp, and men we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t about to pul in peeces the doue of God, that ſame Queen the Church, by diuerſity of names</hi> (as euery ſeueral hereſie had a proper name:) <hi>did not the Apoſtolicke people</hi> (they that followed the doctrine of the Apoſtles) <hi>require a ſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name for themſelues, whereby they might make difference of ſuch as remained vncorrupted</hi> (with hereſie,) <hi>leſt the error of ſome ſhould rent in peeces the vnſpotted virgin of God? Was it not meet that the principall head</hi> (the true Church) <hi>ſhould haue a proper name to be knowne by?</hi> It appeareth by theſe words, that the reaſon of the name <hi>Catholick</hi> was, at the firſt, that there might be a title, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh ſound Chriſtians, and true Churches, from hereticks, &amp; hereticall aſſemblies. To which purpoſe, that he might auow the vſe of this name, he ſignifieth, that it had before bene vſed by Cyprian. And afterward he affirmeth directly, that <hi>the true Chriſtian people are diuided from the hereticall, when they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Catholicke.</hi> But you will perhaps demaund, why <hi>Catholicke</hi> ſhould be applied to make this diſtinction. The reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (as I thinke) is this. The Goſpell by the preaching of the Apoſtles, was ſpred farre &amp; neere ouer the face of the earth, &amp; accordingly diuers Churches in diuers places eſtabliſhed: all which agreed in the vnitie of the ſame faith and doctrine.

                  <p>Now to your proofe, as it lieth, not by way of refutation, but of explication. We grant (as I haue ſaid often) that the Church is common to all people, and places, not ſhut vp any longer within the land of Iewry, nor appropriated to the Iews; and we condemne them of error, who teach (as ſometimes the Donatiſts &amp; Rogatians did) that it is encloſed in Affrick or Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, or Aſia, or America, or any of theſe, and not common to euerie one of them, aſwell as to any of them.

Auſtin willeth them to prooue their ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, when all other Churches failed, by the ſame Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which were to beare witneſſe of thoſe, whom they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. He goeth forward to refute other arguments of theirs in the chapter following, ſtill preſſing them with this, that they ſhould ſhew out of the Scriptures, that the Church founded by the Apoſtles was to vaniſh away, and their facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely to remaine ſincere. This was his courſe, and indeed, what other courſe could he haue taken? The hereticks, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue noted, did not accuſe the Catholicks of any error, againſt the foundation, whereby they might prooue, they had ceaſed to be of the Church: but onely vrged verie abſurdly a dreame of their owne, that all, but they of Donatus part, were
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:21012:155"/>
fallen away. What is this to the queſtion betwixt you and vs? We ſhew euidence of Scripture, to prooue that <note n="k" place="margin">2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 3. See D Abbot and D. Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt.</note> there was to be a defection, that Antichriſt, the head of that defection, is to be the chiefe gouernour of the Eccleſiaſticall ſtate, that his ſeat is to be at Rome: yea we manifeſtly conuince your Apoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Church of many and groſſe hereſies: ſome of them direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouerthrowing the foundation of our Sauiour Chriſts media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip, for the whole puniſhment of all our ſinnes, and the loue of God in chooſing vs to euerlaſting life, without reſpect of any thing on our part, wherby we, &amp; not he, make difference of our ſelues from other: that is, we prooue that the doctrine of your Church is vtterly falſe, in the maine points of predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; iuſtification, without the true beleefe whereof, there can hardly be any true religion: becauſe the greateſt part of Gods glory, which is the end of all religion, is ouerthrowne, or hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by ſuch errors, as your Church maintaines in theſe matters of iuſtification and predeſtination. But to the matter. This generall ground of Auſtins diſputation we acknowledge to be good and ſound: as for that which he addeth, and you eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally vrge, I anſwer with Auſtins good leaue, that the place he brings, prooues not a continuall increaſe of the Church, from <note place="margin">

Our Sauiour doth not ſay, that the Church ſhall grow greater and greater till the end of the world, but that the Goſpell ſhall be preached in all places, before the world haue an end: ſo may it be, though after it is once preached for ſome few yeares, it be out of the world for many yeares together, and afterward be againe begun: and this may befall it oftentimes for all that prophecie.

it is a matter of no ſmall ſtudie, nor ſhort time, to examine what Churches were firſt founded by the Apoſtles, and haue had an orderly ſucceſſion without interruption from time to time: yea when a man hath made the beſt ſearch he can, what hath he to reſt himſelfe vpon, but the report of men, who might deceiue, and be deceiued?

You will aske, what courſe we take for a mans direction in this caſe? Surely the very ſame which the Scriptures teſtify we ought to follow.

I would make no queſtion of any part of your Syllogiſme, if <note place="margin">To the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note> by <hi>foundation from the Apoſtles,</hi> you vnderſtood nothing but A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall doctrine, which is indeed the maine foundation of all true Churches: but you afterward expound your meaning, and acknowledge no foundation from the Apoſtles, but by the miniſtery of ſuch as can deriue their ſucceſſion from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, without any interruption. In this ſenſe therefore I denie your minor, becauſe the former part of it is falſe. For euery true Church hath not, nor need haue, to make it a true Church, ſuch foundation as the Church of the Epheſians had. Yea though we doubt not, but that the Epheſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were conuerted to the faith by ſome of the Apoſtles, and perhaps by the <note n="h" place="margin">

This may appeare, becauſe the Apoſtle makes <hi>the Prophets</hi> their foundation, as wel as the Apoſtles.

                  <p>Wherefore if your minor intend no more, but that euery true Church is builded vpon the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles, in reſpect of their doctrine, no exception could be taken againſt it. For <note n="ſ" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor</hi> 3. 11.</note>

                  <p>To ſupply your want of proofe from the Scriptures, that <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery true Church must haue her foundation from ſome Apoſtle, or ſome man who can fetch his pedegree, without interruption, from the Apoſtles:</hi> you ſeeke to draw in Tertullian for a witneſſe of your error.

your tranſlation: let the skilfull Reader iudge whether I haue cauſe or no. But what of all theſe?

As for your argument of ſucceſſion, you ſhall heare Tertullians iudgment of it. <hi>Let hereticks</hi> (ſaith <note n="z" place="margin">

Firſt, Tertullian ſhewes that it is in vaine for them to pleade ſucceſſion in place, if their doctrine be found contrary to that which the Apoſtles deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: I ſet downe the ſentence before. Secondly, he doubts not to ſay, that by the hereticks diſagreeing from the Apoſtles in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, thoſe Churches which cannot proue themſelues to be
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:21012:160"/>
Apoſtolicke, by naming any Apoſtle, or Apoſtolicke man, as the firſt founder of them, may yet conuince them not to be Apoſtolicke; and are themſelues to be counted Apoſtolicke, becauſe of their conſent in doctrine, with the Apoſtles. This is the ſumme of Tertullians words: the words themſelues run thus. <hi>To this triall</hi> (namely by doctrine, as the next ſentence before ſheweth) <hi>ſhall the hereticks be called by thoſe Churches; which though they cannot alledge any Apostle or Apoſtolicke man for their founder, as being of late, and now daily planted: yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing in the ſame doctrine are neuertheleſſe counted Apoſtolicke, by reaſon of their</hi>

                     <hi>agreement in doctrine.</hi> Do you not ſee, that Tertullian diſputeth for vs, againſt your pretended ſucceſſion? That he confeſſeth, heretickes may alledge perſonall ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? That he acknowledgeth thoſe Churches for true, which cannot deriue their pedegree from the Apoſtles, or any Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicke man? That he maketh the truth of doctrine agreeing with the Apoſtles, a certaine and neceſſarie marke of the true Church? And are you not aſhamed, for all this, to bring Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian for an author of ſo groſſe an error? VVere you ſo blinde that you diſcerned not this your ſelfe, or did you ſo deſpiſe your Readers, that you preſumed, they would neuer haue the wit to ſee your ignorance or craft? It is now diſcouered ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, and yet this one point more muſt be added: that Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian requireth this ſhew of their Churches beginning, not of all heretickes, as you deceitfully alledge him (if you read him your ſelfe, and tooke him not vpon credit, at ſome other mans hands) but onely of thoſe, who pleade their continuance from the time of the Apoſtles. <hi>If any hereſies</hi> (ſaith Tertullian) <hi>dare fetch their continuance from the Apoſtles time, that therefore they may ſeeme Apoſtolicke, becauſe they were, while the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles liued; we may ſay, let them ſhew the beginning of their Churches, let them vnfould the ſucceſſion of their Biſhops, &amp;c.</hi> With ſuch learning and conſcience doe you Papiſts alledge the Fathers, that he muſt needes be honeſter, and wiſer then you, that will not beleeue you, vpon your bare word.

                     <hi>Now it will be good to ſee, if we can by theſe generall grounds conclude, which particular company of men is the true Church of Chriſt: a concluſion of exceeding great conſequence, as touching all matters in controuerſie concerning the doctrine of faith, as may appeare, by the drift of all my former diſcourſe. For the framing of which concluſion, we ſhall not need to bring in compariſon, all the companies or ſects of diuers religions, that haue bene and are in the world: becauſe euerie one can eaſily diſcerne of themſelues, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the helpe of that which hath bene ſaid, that neither</hi> Turks, <hi>nor</hi> Iewes, <hi>nor whatſoeuer other infidels, can be the true Church of Chriſt; becauſe theſe neither haue the name of Chriſtians, neither do they profeſſe to haue the name of Chriſt.

But to ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, there is no compariſon intended therein. For our que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not, whether <hi>your Synagogue, or our congregations, come nearer the ſtate of true Churches</hi> (which ſeemeth to be implied in making a compariſon betwixt them) but <hi>whether of them are indeed true Churches?</hi> If I ſhould compare your Church of Rome, with the Synagogues of the Iewes, the profeſſion of <hi>the Mahometans,</hi> or the companies <hi>of Anabaptiſts,</hi> or other <hi>Hereticks,</hi> I might finde that your doctrine came nearer to the truth, in many points, and ſo were more likely to ſhew me the true Church, or that theſe foure properties agreed better to you then to them. But this compariſon would not ſettle me in the knowledge of a true Church. The point is, as before I ſhewed, the proofe of your Minor, that <hi>the Church of Rome is ſhe, to whom thoſe properties belong.</hi> For the further confirmation whereof, you vndertake to prooue, that our congregations haue no intereſt to theſe titles, and this you do, not by way of compariſon, but by an argument of contraries.

                  <p>In propounding theſe matters againſt vs (of your proofe I will ſpeake afterward) there are a few things worthy obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, that your dealing may be manifeſt to all men. Firſt, you talke of the Proteſtants Church, as if we (like you) fancied to our ſelues ſome one church, beſide which there ſhould be none in the whole world: whereas we acknowledge ſeuerall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in diuers countries to be entire in themſelues, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance of any one vpon any other. Yet do we not denie, that there is a certaine communion betwixt and among all true Churches, which conſiſts in their agreement in doctrine, about all matters of the foundation, and the mutuall helpes of prayer, and of other Chriſtians duties to be performed by one congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to and for another. In this reſpect there is one Church of Proteſtants; and whatſoeuer company holdeth not the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, is no true Church, nor to be counted a member of the Proteſtants Church.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I would know why you require that our Church ſhould be <hi>perfectly one:</hi> ſince you mentioned no ſuch matter, in ſetting downe &amp; expounding the firſt propertie of the Church. If you anſwer, that to be <hi>one,</hi> and to be <hi>perfectly one,</hi> is all one: I pray you remember, that this terme <hi>perfectly</hi> ſhould either haue bin put in before, or bin left out now. Otherwiſe, ſeeing you neuer tell vs, that it is all one, whether <hi>a Church be one,</hi> or <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly one,</hi> why ſhold we not make our aduantage of your words, and preſume that our Church is held by you to be one, though it want ſomwhat of I know not what <hi>perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> imagined by you: which yet you forget, when you come to ſhew that your church is one.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, how doth this ſtrange ſpeech, <hi>vniforme in dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi>

                     <hi>points of faith,</hi> agree with that plainneſſe which you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, for inſtructing of the ſimple? But in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, what meane you by <hi>dogmaticall points?</hi> It had bin very fit you ſhould haue vſed other termes, or atleaſt haue expounded theſe for the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of the ignorant. But this dark ſpeech makes more for you, becauſe it may perhaps affoord you ſome ſtarting hole, if you be hard driuen. Yet a man may geſſe at your meaning, becauſe when you come to proue that the Church of Rome is one, you ſeeme to interprete <hi>dogmaticall points to be matters of faith defined by the Church.</hi> If we take it in this ſenſe, I maruel how you can charge our Churches with variableneſſe in this reſpect? What one point was euer defined by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conſent of our Churches, which hath bin ſince altered by like conſent? If you can ſhew none, as I may well preſume you cannot; till you do, then are our Churches in dogmatical points of faith, as perfectly one, as yours ſo much bragged of.</p>

                        <item>That Church which is variable, according to the varietie of times and perſons, &amp;c. the learned men whereof are at iarre among themſelues in matters of faith, &amp;c. and haue no means to end their controuerſies, is not one.</item>
                        <item>But ſuch is the Proteſtants Church.</item>

                     <hi>men, without meanes to end their controuerſies, do not proue any Church, not to be one,</hi> vnleſſe the matters, about which they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, be of the foundation: ſo that the ignorance of them, or error in them, be in it ſelfe damnable. To make my anſwer plaine, I wil handle as ſhortly as I can, the ſeuerall points of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.

                        <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 15.</note> they held it vnlawfull to impart the Goſpell to the Gentiles. Put caſe now, that ſome of thoſe who followed our Sauiour, had continued in theſe opinions, and that you had bin to giue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, whether they &amp; their companie had bin the true church, or the Apoſtles and people that claue to them: ſurely you muſt needs, according to this firſt part of your reaſon, haue condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the innocent, and iuſtified the wicked. For the Apoſtles Church was not one, becauſe it had varied from ſome opinions formerly held by it, which the other companie ſtill retained. As for your odious manner of propounding the point, <hi>according to the varietie of times and perſons,</hi> it is but a froth of words, and might in regard of the change, haue bin charged in like ſort vpon the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>As for the diſſent of learned men one from another, neither was the Church euer ſo happie as to be without it, and you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it among your owne writers, though not <hi>in matters of faith;</hi> the contrary whereof I will ſhew when I come to that place. But if by matters of faith, you meant ſuch points as are fundamental, I could ſomewhat the rather hearken to you. And yet what ſhall it hinder a Church from being <hi>one,</hi> that the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men of it make queſtion of ſuch maine matters, as long as the Church is not tainted with their priuate errors? Did the Churches of Corinth or Galatia ceaſe to be true Churches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome among them (and as it ſhould ſeeme no ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) <note n="u" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 11</note> in the former denied the reſurrection of the fleſh; <note n="x" place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 4. 5.</note> in the other ioyned the workes of the law with faith to iuſtification? yet were both theſe fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall errors, the continuance wherin without repentance, muſt needs bring certaine damnation. But your matters of faith are all points, though neuer ſo friuolous or falſe, that your Church hath determined by her lawleſſe ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie: whereas many matters of farre greater importance, not ſo decreed, are left free for euery man to erre in, or to be ignorant of, without any danger of damnation, or breach of vnitie.</p>

This laſt point (as you ſay) is <hi>the principall matter appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to vnitie, that there be meanes in the Church to end contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies.</hi> But why, or how ſhould this be ſo principall, when as the Church may agree in the ſame points of doctrine, though priuate men diſſent from each other? Indeed to the procuring of an outward peace, it is very requiſite that particular men be not ſuffered to preach or write one againſt another. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this peace ſo much worth, as that for it the Church ſhould be corrupted with errors: and the chiefe power for the remedying of this inconuenience, is in the hands of the chiefe Magiſtrate, whoſe dutie it is to prouide that his ſubiects <note n="y" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>may leade a quiet and a peaceable life, in all godlineſſe and honeſtie.</hi> Therefore neither doth this diſagreement among the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, make the Church ceaſe to be <hi>one,</hi> though there be no meanes to end it; which yet are not wanting in the true Churches.</p>
                  <p>Your minor alſo is falſe in euery part of it. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ariableneſſe in points of faith according to the variety of times and perſons,</hi> is when <note place="margin">To the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note> (in regard of theſe two) the doctrine of the Church is altered. Now who is ſo ſhameleſſe as to charge vs with hauing altered, and dayly altering our iudgements in reſpect of either of theſe? What neceſſitie or occaſion can varietie of time bring for the change of doctrine? But for perſons, what ſect, profeſſion, church or companie in the world, euer was or could be freer from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on any mans perſon, then we are, who abſolutely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime all mens authority ouer our faith? Are not you they, that <note n="z" place="margin">12. <hi>Art.

And yet you are not aſhamed, to accuſe vs for <hi>varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe in our doctrine, according to the varietie of perſons.</hi> If ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice were not blind, it were vnpoſſible you ſhould ſlaunder vs, with ſo manifeſt contrarieties. You are the men, whoſe faith dependeth vpon the perſons of your Popes, whom you follow blindfold, whither ſoeuer any of them leadeth you. We attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to our teachers no impoſſibilitie of erring, though we haue a reuerend opinion of their knowledge and faithfulneſſe; in regard whereof we do not lightly reiect any doctrine, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition

deliuered by them, vnleſſe it be apparently falſe. Yet doe we not tie our ſelues to take whatſoeuer they teach, as a matter of faith, though we are readie to yeeld to any thing which is plainly prooued to vs out of the word of God, how contrary ſoeuer it be to our former opinions. For we know, that men are ſubiect to error, and that God doth not miraculouſly reueale all truth at once to any man; but as it ſeemes good to his gracious wiſedom, peece by peece enlighteneth the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his ſeruants with the knowledge of his will and word, according to their ſinceritie in depending on him, faith in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon him, &amp; diligence in ſearching the Scriptures, the only ſufficient meanes of inſtruction. The ſecond part of your ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is, that <hi>our learned men ſo iarre in matters of faith, that it is hard to find three in all points of one opinion.</hi> Remember what you call matters of faith, <hi>points of doctrine defined by the Church:</hi> and forbeare bluſhing if you can, when you reade this your accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation againſt vs. What other refutation ſhal I need to vſe, then the bare naming of the harmonie of our confeſſions, wherein the moſt partial Reader of your ſide may diſcerne your ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <hi>hyperbole,</hi> that I may giue it a cleanlier terme then it deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth. To requite your kindneſſe, I challenge you to name me (if you can) any one of your ſchoole-men, that hath not refuted ſome of his owne fellowes in ſome points, or bene refuted by them. I confeſſe there are many of them, that I haue not read: but I am ſo well acquainted with their courſes, and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of one another, that I may venture without aduenture, to make this challenge.</p>

                     <hi>our learned men haue no meanes to end their controuerſies.</hi> If you ſpeake of the euent, that our meanes are not ſufficient <hi>de facto,</hi> to make them that ſtriue, to agree in one opinion, or to make all men to be of one mind: I graunt that you ſay to be true; but I adde withall, that we may haue, when we will, as good meanes to this purpoſe, as your Church hath. For it is no more but to appoint ſome man, to whoſe iudgement we will ſtand in all matters of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. What hereticall Church may not haue the ſame meanes of vnitie, if it pleaſe? But if you denie that, <hi>de iure,</hi> wee haue

meanes ſufficient for the ending of all queſtions: I ſay your minor is vtterly falſe, becauſe we haue the Scriptures appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and bleſſed to that end by God himſelfe. Now as the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie of the word is moſt ſufficient for the begetting of faith, and ſauing of men, though it haue not this excellent effect in all: ſo the Scriptures are of abſolute ſufficiencie to cut off all controuerſies, howſoeuer men will not alwayes be ruled by them.</p>
                  <p>Your minor (as we haue ſeene) containes a grieuous accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of vs in three points of no ſmall importance.

but it was a great vertue to hang vpon Cephas the head. How forgetfull was the Apoſtle Paul both of his dutie to Peter his head, and of ſo readie a meanes to end that ſchiſme, that would not tell them that <hi>Peter was appointed head, to the end all occaſion of ſchiſme might be taken away?</hi> Thirdly, we are not ſo to vnderſtand Ierome, as if he had ſaid, that there was <hi>one head</hi> appointed ouer the whole world, but that in all places where there were multitudes of Presbyters, order was taken that ſome one choſen from among the reſt, ſhould be chiefe and principall in that Dioceſſe, as I may ſpeake, and ouer all them which were in ſome ſort accounted to be but one bodie.

                  <p>We are now come to the principall point of your Minor, wherein it ſtands you vpon to play the man, and to make good thoſe foure properties on the behalfe of your Church of Rome.

But yet if you quit your ſelfe well in this, your Church ſhall be more beholding to you, then it was euer yet to any of your fellowes, in this queſtion.

are to that end reuealed by God; but yet the ſimple ignorance of them, ſo it be without contempt or careleſneſſe, doth not depriue a man of ſaluation by Chriſt. The former of theſe two kindes are more properly matters of faith, being abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſarie to ſaluation. You ſpeake of matters of faith, as though not the points in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, but the determination of the Church ſhould make a neceſſitie of them to ſaluation. So that the not beleeuing of the leaſt matter of ceremonie enioyned by the Church, ſhall be more damnable then the ignorance of the greateſt point of Diuinitie, being not ſo determined. But I would faine know of you, how I ſhall vnderſtand what is to be accounted <hi>determined by the Church?</hi> You confeſſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that it is queſtionable whether <hi>the chiefe Paſtor, that is the Pope alone, or he with a generall Councel, be the Church which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre.</hi> Doubtleſſe, if it be (as you <note n="n" place="margin">Chap. 4.</note> taught vs before) of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie to ſaluation, that <hi>we beleeue entirely all points of faith, without miſbeleeuing any one;</hi> what hope of ſaluation ſhall be left to any Papiſt, who cannot by any meanes know what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the Church, and what is not? Or if he may be ſure that matters defined by the Pope and a Councell, are decided by the Church; yet ſince it is not ſo determined, whether the Pope alone be ſufficient to determine of points in controuerſie, he may refuſe to obey ſome conſtitutions of the Pope, or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue ſome queſtions decided by him; and thereby ſhut him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe out of heauen, for not giuing credit to the determination of the Church, if that authoritie of determining be in the Pope, and he commaund men ſo to beleeue. But if this determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church be ioyntly in the Pope and Councels, and that nothing is a matter of faith, but that which is ſo determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be, then was there almoſt no matter of faith at all in the Church, till within theſe laſt 800 yeares. For it is more then euident to any man, that will not be wilfully contentious, that the Pope neuer bare any extraordinarie ſway in Councels, till he had proclaimed himſelfe vniuerſall Biſhop, which was by the grant of the murtherer Phocas, ſix hundred yeares after the beginning of the Goſpell.

Either ſhew ſome good reaſon, why matters of faith were not, at this time of the Apoſtles liuing, to be tied to generall Councels and the Pope, &amp; yet now muſt be; or confeſſe the truth to the glorie of God, that matters of faith haue their authoritie, to be matters of faith, from the word of God, and not from the determination of Pope or Councell, or both.

You will ſay, the charge of feeding was common to all the Apoſtles; but here the Lord ſpeaketh particularly to Peter. He doth indeed. And do you not ſee the reaſon of it?

                  <p>It is needleſſe therefore to make many words concerning any ſucceſſor of S.

Hereupon Baſil complaines of vnkind dealing. The other to excuſe himſelfe, vndertakes to ſhew that he had not onely not hurt him, but alſo done him a pleaſure, becauſe he had thereby giuen him occaſion and oportunitie to manifeſt his loue to Chriſt, by feeding of his flocke, which he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Peter and his ſucceſſors.

Finally their doctrine of predeſtination is able to make men careleſſe or deſperate in all actions and conſultations, ſith ſome of them hold all things ſo to proceeds of Gods eternall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, that man (in matters of Religion at the leaſt) hath no free-will to do well, or to auoid ill, but that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is author, and moueth them effectually and forcibly, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to good works, but in the ſame ſort vnto the act of ſinne.

Whereas on the contrarie ſide, it hath pleaſed God to giue teſtimonie by miracles of the faith and holineſſe of life of diuers, which profeſſed the Romane faith; of which ſort I might bring in many examples, but I will at this time onely name Saint</hi> Bernard, <hi>Saint</hi> Dominicke, <hi>Saint</hi> Francis, <hi>who on the one ſide, were certainly knowne to haue bene profeſſors of that religion, which was then, and is now profeſſed at Rome; as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, both by that which is left written of their liues, and alſo by this, that they were chiefe fathers and founders of certaine Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous orders of Monkes and Friers, which yet continue there: and on the other ſide, they are certainly knowne to be holy men, partly by</hi>

                     <hi>theſe, muſt needs inferre the like confeſſion of the ſanctitie of mante other, who were alſo profeſſors of the ſame Romane faith, whoſe names we may finde regiſtred in the Calender, euen in bookes ſet out by Protestants, and whoſe vertuous life, holie death, and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous deeds, we may finde in good Authors.

Now this being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that diuers whom we know to haue bene members of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church, are Saints: we may well inferre that at leaſt, ſome part of this Church is holy, and that therefore of this part</hi> (per ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necdochen) <hi>the whole may be tearmed Holy: eſpeciallie conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the faith of this part, (which was a principall roote, out of which their holineſſe did ſpring) is all one in ſubſtance with the faith which we all profeſſe: and therefore we may ſay that our faith and profeſſion inclineth &amp; leadeth to the ſame holineſſe of life that theirs did. And therefore though manie, through their owne fault, faile in the practiſe of vertue and holineſſe, yet our profeſſion (being all one with the profeſſion of theſe holy men) is to be tearmed holy, as theirs was. Of which holy profeſſion in ſome ſort, all our whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie may be called Holy, as of the art of painting or anie other art, all that profeſſe them are commonlie tearmed by a name proper to their profeſſion, though it happen that diuers of them, be not verie skilfull, nor do not much exerciſe his art.</hi>

                     <hi>And from hence riſeth the ſecond difference betwixt Proteſtants and vs, to wit, that the verie doctrine it ſelfe, which Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants teach, doth (as I ſhewed before) induce men to libertie, and conſequently to lewde life: whereas the Romane faith, which we profeſſe, both expreſlie for biddeth all vice, &amp; preſcribeth lawes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to libertie and looſeneſſe of life; and containeth moſt ſoueraigne meanes, to incite and mooue a man to all perfect vertue, and holineſſe of life. As for example.

It teacheth alſo that Gods commaundements be not vnpoſſible to be obſerued; nay nor hard (through helpe of grace, which is alwaies at hand) to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued of one, which hath but a good will; according as Saint</hi> Iohn <note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.</note>

The which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a man to conceiue great hope of eſchewing euill and liuing well, which hope, (and conſequently heart) to do well, a man cannot haue, who perſwadeth himſelfe, that Gods commaundements be vnpoſſible to be obſerued, as I ſhewed before. Againe it teacheth, that as a man may by grace auoid ſinne, and eaſily keepe Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and by doing good works, liue well: ſo this good life is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and acceptable vnto God, and theſe good workes (as proceeding from grace, and receiuing vertue from the merits of Chriſt, of which this grace doth depend) are meritorious, &amp; ſuch, for reward wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, God will giue to them that perſeuerantly do them, euerlaſting bliſſe in the kingdome of heauen. The which doctrine will, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe if it be duly conſidered, breed in a mans mind great loue and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to do well; as the contrarie muſt needs breed, at leaſt a coldneſſe in deuotion, if not a contempt and loathing of good deeds, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of thoſe good deeds, which haue any difficultie annexed to them. It teacheth alſo that for ſinners are prepared exceeding great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments in the next life; and that though there be meanes in the Church to get remiſſion of ſinne, and pardon of the paine, yet it tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth that a man cannot ordinarily be abſolutely certaine, that he hath ſo vſed thoſe meanes, as that he hath thereby gotten that remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or pardon; which is a great motiue to make men warie not to fall into ſinne, and to mooue them,</hi> Cum metu &amp; tremore operari ſalutem, <hi>with feare &amp; trembling to worke their ſaluation: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>

Furthermore it preſcribeth wholeſome lawes and cuſtomes of fasting and praier, and of other exerciſes of vertue and pietie, whereby the fleſh may be ſubiect to the ſpirit, and the ſpirit to God. It maintaineth alſo ſecret confeſſion of ſinnes to a Prieſt; as being a thing neceſſarie, and commaunded by our Sauiour himſelfe, the which both is a great bridle to hold men backe from ſinne (as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teacheth) and is a ſpeciall meanes, whereby the Paſtours of the Church, knowing the inward conſcience of their flock, may better apply fit remedies to their ſpirituall diſeaſes, and preſcribe to euery one fit exerciſes, for their practiſe and progreſſe in vertue. Finally the profeſſion of this Church is ſuch, that euen ſimple Proteſtants, when they ſee any Catholicke do a thing amiſſe, will ordinarily ſay,</hi> You ſhould not do thus, or, a man of your profeſſion ſhould do otherwiſe. <hi>So that thoſe which be ſinfull in the Roman Church, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in any ſort, aſcribe their ſinnes to any defect, or peruerſitie of the doctrine of the Church, but muſt needs acknowledge them to proceed from their owne frailtie or malice, contrarie to the teaching of the Church, and ſometimes euen contrarie to their owne conſcience, and actuall knowledge.</hi>

                     <hi>Wherefore I may conclude, that although there be ſome ſinfull men in the Romane Church, yet it may well be called Holy; becauſe the doctrine which it beleeueth and profeſſeth, of it owne nature, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth and directeth a man to the true holineſſe, and conſequently is of it ſelfe Holy: and alſo becauſe there be many holy perſons in it, ſome of which are certainely knowne in particular to be ſuch, by proofe of miracle. Others are onely knowne by this probable reaſon, to wit, that they hold the ſame faith, which was holden by thoſe, who haue bene certainly knowne be holy men; and holding the ſame faith (which muſt needs be the true faith, ſith none are truely holy, or can poſſibly pleaſe God, without the right faith, which is but one,) they haue in them a roote, out of which true holineſſe is apt to ſpring. And therefore, when we ſee no apparent euill fruit, whereby we may diſcouer ſome euill roote, but onely good, which is apt to ſpring of this good roote; and eſpecially when we ſee the fruite of their good works, to be conformable, and like to the works of thoſe, which are knowne Saints; we haue great cauſe to iudge, that they alſo are iuſt men, and in ſome ſorte holy, if not perfectly Saintes.</hi>

                     <hi>Sith therefore many men which haue bene and are members of the Romane Church, haue bene &amp; are knowne, either by abſolute proofe of miracle, or at leaſt in this other manner to be holy; of theſe as of the better, more worthie and principall part, the whole may be (as I ſaid before) tearmed Holy; as a tree that hauing a roote apt to giue life to the branches, ſome of which being dead, others haue life, is abſolutely ſaid to be aliue; which if we ſhould ſee to haue a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted roote, and could not perceiue it to haue any liuing branches, we ſhould haue cauſe to affirme abſolutely, that it were dead, and not aliue.</hi>

For the preſent, I ſay no more, but that you ſpeake craftily to deceiue vs, in comparing moſt of our men, with I know not what men, that haue liued in the Roman Church. There is no queſtion, but that (generally) the moſt are the worſt, euerie where: becauſe all men are naturally euill, and none good, but by the eſpeciall grace of God working in them. But if you would haue dealt plainely, you ſhould haue ſhewed, that moſt men in our Churches are more wicked, then moſt men that haue liued in your Romiſh Church, ſince it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the bodie of Antichriſt reuealed. For we acknowledge, that the Church of Rome was ſomtimes a true Church of Chriſt, yeelding many worthie martyrs, confeſſors, and other holy men and women, to the honour of the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt; yea we denie not, but that euen at this day, there are ſome true Chriſtians in your Churches: and that the generall ſort of Proteſtants, are inferiour to ſome amongeſt you, in
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:21012:179"/>
regard of outward holineſſe: as for true inward ſanctitie, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one, nor the other, haue any part of it; I meane neither ordinarie Proteſtants, nor the beſt of your ſide, who continue in the whole doctrine of your Church.</p>
                  <p>To prooue that you ſay againſt our Church, you bring vs in two kinde of witneſſes: firſt generally thoſe men, that haue ſeene the conuerſation of your Papiſts, and our Proteſtants, then particularly Luther &amp; Smidelin: In the former, conſider how vaine a floriſh it was for you to compare our men now with Papiſts that liued in old time, and to appeale for proofe to them that haue ſeene both: as if you were able to ſhew vs ſome men of 700, or 800. yeares old, or of 300. or 400, who haue knowne and conſidered the behauiour of your men and ours. As for them, that by trafficke or trauaile otherwiſe, haue had ſight and experience of both, I dare ſtand to their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in comparing our liues with yours, for all parts of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cariage. In which matter, I haue bene credibly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by them, whoſe credit I haue no cauſe to ſuſpect, that the abhomination of your Clergies, and peoples liues, hath part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bred, &amp; ſetled in them a reſolute abhorring of your religion, to which otherwiſe they were indifferently affected.</p>
                  <p>But you preſſe vs with Luther and Smidelin, who in their earneſt exhortations and reproofes, accuſe our men for increaſe of ſinne, after the preaching of the Goſpell. Is this ſtrange? Doth not <note n="o" place="margin">

which we alledge for our ſelues againſt this ſlander?

To al this you reply not ſo much as one word; but tell them that will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue you, that there neuer was any Saint or holy man of our Church. I cannot greatly blame you, though you bind your fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to giue credit to you, without looking for proofe of that you deliuer. For if you ſhould be put to that, all were marred. But I wil render you a reaſon, why we lay challenge to all thoſe men, as members of our Church, and not of yours. They agree (ſay we, diſproue vs if you can) with vs in the ſubſtance of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, concerning ſaluation by Ieſus Chriſt, and other points of the foundation. If you were able to ſhew the like (which is vnpoſſible) yet would it not follow that they were of your Church: becauſe no man is, in your account a member of your Church, but he that agrees with you in all matters defined by your Church; wherein I confidently anow (and am readie to iuſtifie it) there is no auncient writer in the firſt thouſand years, that is of your opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; though in ſome one point or other they may agree with your doctrin. But indeed we haue no ſaints canonized by our Church, and made mediators betwixt God and vs, to rob Ieſus Chriſt of his office, and God the Father <note place="margin">a See my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to 12. art. part. 1. art. 4.</note> of thanks due to him for granting our requeſts. And if this want make our Church vnholy, the Church in the time of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himſelfe and of his Apoſtles was moſt vnholy, in which there neuer was any ſuch practiſe or doctrine. Indeed this is the maine holineſſe, whereby <note n="z" place="margin">

                  <p>And what ſay you againſt our doctrine in this behalfe? Forſooth, that <hi>it cannot of it ſelfe leade the moſt preciſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruers of it to holineſſe.</hi> The particulars of our doctrine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed by you, ſhall be defended in their ſeuerall places: now a word or two onely in generall. How doth any doctrine leade
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:21012:181"/>
to holineſſe, but by propounding the rules of true obedience to God, wherein all holineſſe conſiſts? How doe the arts of <hi>Grammer, Logicke, Arithmeticke</hi> and <hi>Geometry</hi> leade a man to <hi>ſpeake, reaſon, number,</hi> and <hi>meaſure well,</hi> but by deliuering the true rules to theſe purpoſes, which in themſelues direct to perfection in euery one of theſe profeſſions? And can our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be ſaid to be inſufficient, which acknowledgeth the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God to be the rule of all righteouſneſſe, and all men bound to liue in obedience to the will of God, contained and reuealed in them? Do not we teach men, that vpon paine of damnation they muſt labour to keepe all Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whatſoeuer? Are not our expoſitions of the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as large in duties preſcribed, and ſins forbidden, as yours are?

                  <p>It is vtterly vntrue, that our doctrine inclines any man <hi>to breake faſting dayes:</hi> nay rather we enioyne all men to obſerue dayes lawfully ſet apart for faſting, with all care and good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, both for preparation to, and cariage in the action. As for your dayes of abſtaining from fleſh, we hold the inſtitution of them to be voyd of Religion, and vnlawfull, as making them in themſelues a part of Gods ſeruice: whereas a man, for all your faſting, may glut and gorge himſelfe with wine and all dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſo he eate no fleſh, and yet keepe your Popiſh faſt, without danger of any cenſure for tranſgreſſing your law of faſting.</p>

It is ſo far from being a remedie of ſinne, as it is vſed by your church, that it rather prouokes men to ſinne, becauſe they haue ſo readie and eaſie a meanes to disburden their conſciences (as

                  <p>There is no one point, wherein you more bewray your ſelues to be ſeruants, and not ſons of God, then this confeſſion againſt your owne ſoules, that you would neglect the doing of good workes, but that you looke to merite euerlaſting life by them. This motiue to good workes is ſo baſe, that no man of a free nature would yeeld vnto it. The very Philoſophers could teach you, that <hi>vertue is to be loued for vertue,</hi> and not for any outward reſpect or conſequent that may follow thereupon: and God is more diſhonored by your opinion of meriting, then honored by any your ſuppoſed good workes whatſoeuer. If you had euer felt, what a ſharpe ſpurre to holineſſe of life the aſſurance of forgiueneſſe of ſinnes is, you would neuer thinke that the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of good workes is lightly eſteemed, where the mercie of God hath brought peace to the damned conſcience. And yet we want not that other helpe, expectation of reward, which we are ſure ſhal be giuen to the leaſt of our good works, though not vpon their deſert, but of the meere mercie of God in Ieſus Chriſt. That wicked opinion of merit, either before or after grace, doth puffe vp the pride of mans nature, and diminiſh the glorie of Gods mercie in Ieſus Chriſt. Wages vpon deſert, is the hire of ſeruants; reward beſtowed in loue, is the gift of a kind father to a gracious ſonne, who hath ſhewed himſelf wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to performe duties of obedience.</p>
                  <p>What men doth it make careleſſe, but thoſe proud Phariſes that ſtand at the ſtaues end with God, and thinke ſcorne to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in keeping the commandements, vnleſſe they may ſo keep them, as to claime heauen vpon deſert by keeping of them?

There is no man, vnleſſe he be more deſirous of his owne glorie then Gods, but wil be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and glad to confeſſe his vnabilitie to performe the whole will of God perfectly, and yet ſtriue from time to time to doe as much as his corruption will giue way to. It ſeemes, that not diuinitie onely, but alſo common reaſon failes you. Shall I be careleſſe in bearing my horſe head, and holding him vp from falling, becauſe I am ſure he treads neuer a ſure ſtep, but will ſtumble or trip continually, do the beſt I can? Put caſe we ſaid, as you ſlaunder vs, that whatſoeuer we do is ſin: are there there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no degrees in ſinne? or is it all one, to ſin by infirmitie and wilfulneſſe? What if a ſicke man cannot by any meanes recouer his perfect health againe? ſhall he therefore refuſe to keepe a good diet, and grow to as much ſtrength as for his weakneſſe he can attaine to? But what Proteſtant euer ſaid, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer we do is ſinne? It is one thing to ſay (as we do) <note n="c" place="margin">Anſwer to 12. art. part 2. art. 2.</note> that ſinne by our corruption cleaues faſt to our beſt works, another thing to auouch (as you falſly charge vs) that all we do is ſinne.

Beſides I bring you the ſame proofe, that Bellarmine bringeth for himſelfe, that is, I ſay they were all of our Church. If it be abſurd to do ſo, let your Cardinall learne to diſpute better. It were long to enter into particulars, yet if I had brought the argument, I would for ſhame haue ſaid ſome what in proofe of it: but let it paſſe as it comes for this once. Againſt whom make you all this diſcourſe, to prooue that it is not poſſible to know certainly, who are holy, and who are not? Surely not againſt the Proteſtants, who confeſſe as much.

As long as God hath giuen teſtimonie of the holineſſe of theſe worthies, our Church cannot be ſaid to haue had none certainly knowne to be holy. But though we builde not vpon any ſuch ground, tel me what it wanted of amiracle, that a poore Frier ſhould ſet himſelfe againſt the Pope, and the whole ſtate of your Church: and for all the malice &amp; perſecution of the Pope, the Emperor, and generally all the eſtates of theſe weſterne parts, as well ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, as Eccleſiaſticall, except a Prince or two in Germany con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted by him, continue and grow ſo many yeares, and leaue behind him, (after a peaceable and godly death) ſo many heires of his doctrine, daily increaſing and multiplying? It is enough that the word of God beareth witneſſe to the truth of his doctrine, though we haue neither miracle, nor reuelation of his holineſſe. But you would make the world beleeue, that he and Caluin attempted to worke miracles. If it had bene ſo, it was not to breed an opinion of their holineſſe, but to auow the truth of their doctrine. But to whom can it ſeeme like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they which denied, that any miracles were to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for, and taught that Antichriſt ſhould come with ſignes and wonders, would go about ſuch a needleſſe, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full peece of worke? What tell you vs of the Apoſtata Bolſec, or Staphylus, who ſolde themſelues to lie for the Popes aduantage?

Who would not rather name the Sunne, then any ſtarre of the firſt magnitude, or the Moone her ſelfe, to prooue that there is light in the skie? But you knew how filthie that fountaine of your holineſſe is. Well, let them go as they are: you haue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vs three: the ancienteſt of whom is not yet ſix hundred yeares old. What ſay you of them? Firſt, that they were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knowne to haue bene profeſſors of that ſame Religion, which was then, and is now profeſſed at Rome. To whom is this certainly knowne? How many of our men haue ſhewed that the Religion of the Church of Rome is altered in diuers points, ſince Bernards time? The Councell of Trent is the pit, out of which the religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your preſent Church is digged.

To proue that theſe three were of your Church, as it is now, you alledge that which is left written of their liues, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious orders of Monkes and Friers founded by them. What is written of them, and by whom? Doth any man in penning their liues, affirme, that they held the ſame things in all points that your Church now holds? I trow not. But if he do, who told him ſo? If he liued in their times, he was no prophet to foreſee what would be maintained in your Church ſome hundreds of yeares after his death. If he be a late writer, what reaſon haue we to giue credit to him in ſuch a matter, farther then he is able to make good that he ſaith, by ſhewing ſuch an agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt their doctrine, and that which now you teach? That they haue left certaine orders behind them, we denie not; which may ſerue to proue, that they thought it needfull to haue people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the knowledge of the Goſpell by preaching, and ſome trained vp of purpoſe to performe that dutie, which was the firſt end of monaſteries. But it is no eaſie matter to ſhew that your Monkes and Friers are now gouerned according to the rules appointed by them, nor any inconuenience for vs to graunt that they were of your opinion touching Frieries and monaſteries, which are matters far from the foundation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as long as there is no opinion of merit or perfection an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed thereunto.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing you affirme of them, is, that they were holy men, certainly knowne to be ſo.

But this our iudgment is not of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie, vnleſſe we may haue better proofe for it then this you bring. Their liues (you ſay) and miracles teſtifie as much. But firſt, who ſhall aſſure vs that they liued ſo holily, and wrought ſuch miracles? Wee muſt haue certaine knowledge that they were holy men, who writ and reported theſe things, ere we can vpon their credit beleeue, that they ſo behaued themſelues.

                  <p>But Luther and other of our men confeſſed them to haue bene ſaints. It had bene plaine dealing to haue ſaid <hi>holy men:</hi> whereas you craftily ſay <hi>ſaints,</hi> as if Luther had giuen ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of your ſaints canonized. But do Luther and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanckthon hold them for ſaints, becauſe of their miracles, or as a thing certainly knowne to them? How could they vnderſtand what they were, but by report? They iudged charitably of them, according to the opinion that was of them in the world. And for my part, I am perſwaded of Bernard, that he was a man of a ſincere heart, and true ſanctification. But for Francis, if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his fiue wounds be true, I will not doubt to affirme, that he was either a wretched hypocrite in faining that miracle, or a ſilly ideot to be ſo abuſed by the diuell. The tale lies thus: that this ſame Saint Francis forſooth ſhould haue in his ſide, hands and feete, ſuch wounds as our Sauiour had, which continued always green, and were made in his bodie by I know not what ſtreames that iſſued from the Crucifixe, from the ſide, hands and feete thereof, to his ſide, hands and feete. This matter being cunningly caried by this Pope-holy ſaint, a woman ſaint, one Katharine of Sene counterfetted the like, and with like ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. Afterward <note n="e" place="margin">Relacion de la ſantidad y<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>llagas de la &amp;c en Seuilla 1589.</note> euen of late yeares there was the like pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe by one Marie a Prioreſſe in Portugall, of Saint Dominicks order: who caried the matter very cleanly for a time, till it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to diſcouer her couſinage by meanes of certaine of the Nunnes, who thought ſcorne that ſhe ſhould be a ſaint ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they; and therefore watched her ſo narrowly, and
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:21012:189"/>
gaue out ſuch ſuſpicious ſpeeches of her, that at laſt the whole packe of her diſſembling was opened, and ſhe enioyned fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable penance of faſting and praying, &amp;c. There is extant a moſt abhominable treatiſe of Saint Francis conformitie to Chriſt, <note place="margin">Barthol dePiſts conform. S. Franciſci.</note> wherein hee is at the leaſt equalled, if not preferred before him. But becauſe this was none of Francis owne doing, let it be as it is, the blaſphemous ſinne of your Church. Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke was little better then his fellow Francis, as his Legend ſheweth.</p>
                  <p>Vpon theſe premiſſes thus weakly proued, you bring in two concluſions: the former, that <hi>this holineſſe being confeſſed of thoſe three, muſt needs inferre the like confeſſion of the ſanctitie of many other, who were alſo profeſſors of the ſame Romane faith.</hi> If their profeſſion had bene the cauſe of their holineſſe, then you had not gathered much amiſſe. But their holineſſe (if the two latter had any) aroſe from their true faith in Chriſt, wrought in them by the holy Ghoſt, the author of that faith. But there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in their times, as reſolute maintainers of the Romiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as they, who neuer attained to any ſuch opinion of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and the faith you Romaniſts now profeſſe, is in maine points of iuſtification and free-will, other then that which Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard taught. For though I haue followed you in ſaying <hi>their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,</hi> yet I acknowledge none of the three to haue bene holy, but onely Bernard. Neither are our Kalenders any euidence to proue the holines of the reſt of your Saints, though their names are continued by Almanacke writers; becauſe many old deeds and euidences are dated by their names, and not by the dayes of the moneth. The Saints Athanaſius and Bernard write of, were none of your Church, and yet (by your iudgement) both of them might be deceiued in determining who were Saints. As for Antoninus and Surius, two of your Popes vaſſailes, their teſtimonie is little worth, in any indifferent mans opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                  <p>Your latter concluſion is, that <hi>ſome part of your Church is holy,</hi> and that therefore <hi>the whole may be termed holy.</hi> But, as I haue ſaid, whatſoeuer holineſſe was in any of the profeſſed members of your Church, it ſprung from another roote then growes
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:21012:190"/>
in your church. Neither is there any reaſon to terme your whole companie <hi>holy,</hi> becauſe a few among them are holy; who in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their holineſſe, are indeed none of your company. That which they haue common with the reſt of you, makes them not holy, but rather vnholy; namely their profeſſion of ſubiection to your ſea of Rome, and their erring with you in diuers points of doctrine: their holineſſe growes from a true acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſaluation by faith onely, and a reſting vpon Ieſus Chriſt accordingly, without any opinion of merit in their owne acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, either before or after grace; together with a beleefe and feeling, that not they themſelues by their free will enlightened, but God by his mercy and grace made difference betwixt them and other, vouchſafing them the gift of faith, and not beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it vpon other. Your ſimilitude of painting, painteth out the fondneſſe of your conceit. For <hi>being a Christian,</hi> anſwers to <hi>being a painter,</hi> in this ſimilitude, and <hi>being holy,</hi> to <hi>being skilfull.</hi> Now as euery man that is free of that Companie, is by his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome a painter, but not thereby skilfull: ſo all that profeſſe Chriſtian Religion, are thereby Chriſtians, but not therefore holy. Neither if one or two, or a few of theſe painters were skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, would any diſcreet man ſay, that the whole company might be termed skilfull, becauſe all make profeſſion of the ſame art of painting, wherein ſome of them are skilfull.</p>
                  <p>How falſly our doctrine was ſlaundered by you, with indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing men to libertie, I ſhewed in my anſwer to your accuſation: now let vs ſee wherein yours is better. Firſt you propound two general points, that <hi>it forbids expreſly all vice, and preſcribes lawes contrary to libertie.</hi> And are you able to charge vs with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary? Doe we not more ſtrictly interprete the lawes of God then you do? Are we not further from idolatry, allowing no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious <note place="margin">Homily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt perill of idolatrie. par. 3. pag. 94.</note> vſe of any image? Do we not more abhorre ſwearing, and expound the third commandement againſt your prophane othes of Maſſe, Marie, Ladie, and all your Saints, which you account matters of ſmal moment? Who teach men to keepe the whole Sabbath, you or we? Who make a maine point of Gods law, <hi>the loue of our enemies,</hi> a counſell, and not a commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; we or you? Who maintaine aequiuocation &amp; officious lies,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:21012:190"/>
but you? Are not you they that hold murdering of Princes, yea euen of your owne Soueraignes, to be meritorious workes? What ſhould I name particulars? You are the men that make the corruption of our nature to be nothing elſe but the want of righteouſneſſe, that ought to be in vs. You are the men who teach vs, that originall ſinne in the regenerate, is not properly ſinne; that vncleane, vnnaturall, vnruly, ambitious, couetous, murderous, and ſuch like thoughts and motions are no ſinnes, vnleſſe we yeeld to them, or delight in them. Doe not you perſwade men, that many ſinnes are not mortall, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall; and ſo make men ruſh into them, without feare or ſhame?</p>
                  <p>Your ſecond point is, that <hi>your religion containes moſt ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne meanes to incite men to perfit vertue and holineſſe of life.</hi> What, more ſoueraigne, then God hath appointed in his word? You will not dare to ſay ſo, for very ſhame of the world. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines then, that you ſhew what meanes we neglect of al them that God hath commaunded vs to vſe. Do we not miniſter the ſacraments to our people? Do we not offer vp prayers, ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and interceſſions to God for them? But, that I may not runne through all particulars at once: let vs ſee what you bring peece by peece.</p>
                  <p>This firſt point giueth a taſt of that maine difference, which may be obſerued betwixt your Religion and ours. You ſo carie the matter, that you alwayes prouide for the freedome of mans will, whatſoeuer become of the glorie of God. We make it our chiefe care to aduance Gods glorie, though thereby we take ſomewhat from the pride of man. Let vs make this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the particular queſtion we haue in hand. Wherein firſt wee graunt as much as you affirme: that Gods predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation doth not take away mans free will. But herein lies the difference betwixt you and vs: you teach that <hi>God doth onely giue a man abilitie to beleeue, and doe good workes, leauing it to himſelfe, to beleeue or not to beleeue, to do good, or not to do good.</hi> We contrariwiſe auouch, that <hi>God, beſides this abilitie, doth alſo incline our hearts to beleeue, and do, according to his owne holy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:</hi> yet doe we not any way imagine, that a man is forced
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:21012:191"/>
to beleeue; but onely teach, that whereas any man beleeueth it was fore appointed by God, that hee ſhould beleeue: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could it in the euent otherwiſe fall out, though he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue willingly, and by his owne choiſe. <note n="f" place="margin">See my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to 12. art part. 2. art. 4.</note> Your doctrine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man more beholding to himſelfe then to God, for his faith and good workes: becauſe God did no more for him, then he doth ordinarily for many other men, who are yet vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly caſt away. God indeede gaue him abilitie to beleeue, if he would; but for all that, he might haue refuſed to beleeue, and ſo haue bene damned. Therefore whereas he doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, and is ſaued, he may thanke himſelfe, and not God. Thus you prouide for mans free will, with the impeachment of Gods glorie. We on the other ſide acknowledge, that as we haue power to beleeue, from the grace of God, ſo it is he that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth our hearts to beleeue, and certainly and <hi>neceſſarily</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the euent, though freely in reſpect of our will, brings vs to beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt. So that you by this opinion, giue man the glorie of his ſaluation: wee leaue it wholly to God.</p>
                  <p>Now for the deſpaire of ſhunning euill, and doing well, which (in your conceit) enſueth vpon our opinion: there is no ſuch matter. Who ſhall be in deſpaire of ſhunning ſinne, by this doctrine? No man that hath grace. For with him the ſpirit of God is alwayes preſent, to prouoke and incline him to well doing. And this muſt needs encourage him thereto much more, becauſe he is the abler to performe any good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. As for him that is ſtill in his naturall eſtate, I hope you graunt, that there is no good to be looked for at his hands: I meane ſuch good, as may further him to euerlaſting life. But (ſay you) <hi>he can haue no hope to obtaine faith and grace, becauſe it is not within the compaſſe of mans free will to make choiſe of it, when it is offered.</hi> What though it be not? Do not we teach withall, that euerie man, to whom God affoordeth the meanes of faith, that is the miniſterie of the word, may and ought to aſſure himſelfe, that the ſpirit of God will be get faith in him, if he will ſhew himſelfe willing to be inſtructed and inclined, as he may doe, if he will aduiſedly conſider what his eſtate is
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:21012:191"/>
by nature, and what offer is made him by God? onely he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not feede his naturall pride with a conceipt of being the chiefe procurer of his owne felicitie.</p>
                  <p>It is not vnpoſſible to obſerue the law, but to keepe it <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,</hi> ſo that a man cannot be charged with the breach of it in any point. Why doth <note n="g" place="margin">

The commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God indeed are not grieuous to anie man regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate by Gods ſpirit, becauſe (as <note n="k" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 21.</note> the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>he deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the law of God:</hi> and by reaſon of his loue to God, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothing too heauie or too hard: as <note n="l" place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>What? cannot a man haue any heart to do well, vnleſſe hee puffe vp himſelfe with a proud conceit of being able perfectly to fulfill the whole law? How did Dauid and Daniel? Theſe are the Phariſaicall thoughts of you Papiſts, who thinke ſcorne to be beholding to God for his mercie, in forgiuing your ſinnes after baptiſme, without your owne ſatisfaction: and who will haue all of deſert, in the rigour of iuſtice. Is it not enough for a poore ſoule, who is priuie to his owne grieuous infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, many ſlips and great corruptions, that the Lord vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth to accept of his weake endeuours, and will crowne them with reward of glorie, for all their imperfections; but that he muſt alſo preſume of his power to keepe the whole law? You are the men that valew the pride of your corrupt nature, at an higher rate, then the glorious riches of Gods mercy in Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Here you manifeſtly bewray the pride of your hearts,

We acknowledge, that our vnperfect obedience is acceptable to God, and that he will certainly reward euery leaſt good worke of any of his children, with a great meaſure of glorie in heauen. Only the doctrine of the ſcriptures, the knowledge of our owne imperfections, and our deſire to giue all glory to God, makes vs to renounce all opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of merit, &amp; to appeale to Gods gracious promiſe onely for our reward. If theſe reſpects be not of ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent force with any man (as with none of you that are grounded Papiſts, they are) but that he can contemne or loathe doing of good, for all them; what ſhould I ſay, but that he ſhewes himſelf to be a ſeruant, and not a ſon: and therefore can haue no claime to the kingdome of heauen, which is the inheritance of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? <note place="margin">

                  <p>VVhereas, to deceiue your owne hearts with an opinion of deſert, you aſcribe the merite of your workes to the merits of Chriſt, and teach that they are meritorious, by being dipped in his bloud: you ſhew either your ignorance or your dallying. If you thinke as you ſpeake, you bewray your ignorance: if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, you dally with our Sauiour and his bloud. Are you able indeed to keepe the commaundements perfectly? what need haue you then of Chriſts bloud, to dip your workes in? For the perfect obſeruation of the law, brings of it ſelfe euerlaſting life, without any merit of Chriſt. Let it be from his merits, that you haue this abilitie to performe the law. Vpon the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it, the hire of eternall happines is abſolutely due vnto you. VVhy do you then trifle thus with our Sauiour, as if you would make him beleeue, that you thinke your ſelues more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to him, then indeed you can do? If you need Chriſts bloud, your works are vnperfit: if they be perfit, you need it not. Leaue this halting betwixt Chriſt and your ſelues, leſt he be auenged of your dallying.</p>
                  <p>To what purpoſe do you mention this your teaching, that exceeding puniſhment is due to ſinne in the next life? Doe not we teach this more effectually then you? We make the leaſt ſinne liable to euerlaſting condemnation: you teach,

We teach the contrarie, that as many, as in the ſight of their ſinnes, with true ſorrow for them, caſt themſelues vpon Chriſt by faith to be iuſtified by him, both obtaine pardon of all their tranſgreſſions, and alſo receiue euerie one in their meaſure, and time, aſſurance that they are pardoned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Your doctrine</hi> (you ſay) <hi>maketh men warie, not to fall into ſinne.</hi> It reſtraineth mortall ſinne onely. For veniall ſinne cannot be puniſhed but in Purgatorie, vnleſſe a man be guiltie of mortall alſo: and if a man can make friends to the Pope, as it is no hard matter to do, eſpecially if he be well monied, he may eaſily auoid all thoſe exceeding great puniſhments. Or if he can but haue a Prieſt to ſing maſſe for him euerie <note place="margin">Vide ſpeculum exemplar. paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſim.</note> day (and maſſes are not verie high rated) he ſhall be ſure to be deliuered, within a ſhort ſpace. If the worſt come to the worſt, Purgatorie cannot out laſt the world, and then he goeth vp to heauen, without any more ado. But yet men are kept in awe from committing of deadly ſinnes. Neuer a whit. For it is generally preached by your Friers and Prieſtes, that confeſſion purgeth all ſins: and your people (ordinarily) are not ſo skilfull (no not one among a thouſand) as to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betwixt ſinnes in this ſort: but they beleeue, that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their confeſſion, and abſolution (if they doe the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce appoynted by their ghoſtly Father) they are as free from all their ſinnes, as when they were newly bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning our doctrine, though we teach men, that aſſurance is to be had; yet we withall inſtruct them, that it is neuer in this life abſolutely without doubting, at all times: and <note place="margin">ſ See my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to 12.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly I finde that the Proteſtants companie is not Catholicke, that is to ſay vniuerſall, neither in time, nor in place; for it came vp of late, and is but in few places of Chriſtendome: neither in points of doctrine; for their doctrine conſiſteth chiefely of negatiues, that is to ſay in denying diuers points, which haue bene generally held in former ages: as appeareth by the Chronicles of the</hi> Magdebur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes <hi>their owne Doctors, who confeſſe that the ancient Fathers held this and that, which they now denie. And there is no learned Protestant (vnleſſe he be too too impudent) but he will confeſſe, that there cannot be aſſigned a viſible companie of men (profeſſing the ſame faith, which they do) euer ſince Chriſt his time, continuing without interruption till now. And therefore, will he, nill he, he muſt confeſſe, that the Proteſtants Church is not vniuerſall, and therefore not Catholicke, as out of Scripture, I ſhewed Chriſts true Church muſt be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the Romane Church is Catholicke. For firſt, it hath bene continually without ceaſing ſince Chriſt and his Apoſtles time, ſtill viſibly (though ſometimes in perſecution) profeſſing the ſame faith which is receiued from the Apoſtles, without change till this day. It is therefore Catholicke or vniuerſall in time. It hath alſo had, and hath at this day, ſome in euerie countrey, where there are any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, (which is almoſt, if not abſolutely euerie where) that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth and agreeth with it, in profeſſion of faith. Therefore</hi>
                     <pb n="368" facs="tcp:21012:194"/>
                     <hi>it is alſo Catholicke or vniuerſall in place. It teacheth alſo an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall and moſt ample vniforme doctrine of God, of Angels, of all other creatures, and ſpecially of man, of mans firſt framing, of his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall end, of things pertaining to his nature, of his fall by ſinne, of his reparation by grace, of lawes preſcribed vnto him, of vertues which he ought to embrace, of vices which he ought to eſchew, of Chriſt our Redeemer, his Incarnation, life, death, reſurrection, aſcenſion, and comming againe to iudgement, of Sacraments, and all other things, that any way pertaine to Chriſtian religion. Neither doth it at this day denie any one point of doctrine of faith, which in former times was vniuerſally receiued, for a veritie of the Catholicke Church. The which if any man will take vpon him to gaineſay, let him ſhew and prooue if he can, what point of doctrine the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church doth denie, or holde contrarie to that, which by the Church was vniuerſally held before: as we can ſhew diuers points that the Proteſtants ſo hold or denie. Let him (I ſay) ſhew and prooue by ſetting downe the point of doctrine, the author, the time, the place, and what companie did oppoſe themſelues againſt it, and who they were that did continue (as the true Church muſt ſtill continue) in the profeſſion of the former faith, lineally, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, till theſe our daies: as we can ſhew and prooue against them. Let him alſo ſhew what countrey there is, or hath bene, where Chriſtian faith either was firſt planted, or afterwards continued, where ſome, at leaſt haue not holden the Romane faith: as we can ſhew euen at this day, diuers places where their religion is ſcarce heard of, eſpecially in the</hi> Indian, Iaponian, <hi>and</hi> China <hi>countries, which were not long ſince, firſt conuerted to the Chriſtian faith, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by thoſe, who were members of the Romane Church, and chiefly by Ieſuites ſent thither by the authoritie of the Pope. And to go no further then our deare countrie England: we ſhall finde in the Chronicles that it was conuerted by Augustine a Monke, ſent by Saint Gregorie the Pope, and that it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued in that faith, without knowledge of the Proteſtants religion, which then, and for diuers</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">See the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Saint Bede, lib. 1. cap. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>hundred yeares after, was neuer heard off, as being then vnhatched. The like record of other countries conuerted by meanes of thoſe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who either were directly ſent by the Pope or Biſhop of Rome, or at leaſt, communicated and agreed in profeſſion of faith, with him,</hi>

                     <hi>we may finde in other Hiſtories. Laſtly let him ſhew ſome ſpace of time, in which the Romane Church was not ſince Chriſt and his Apoſtles time, or in which it was not viſible &amp; knowne: as we can ſhew them many hundred yeares, in which theirs was not at all. Let him (I ſay) therefore ſhew and prooue, (which neuer any yet did or can prooue) that euer the Romane Church did either faile to be, or to be viſible: or being ſtill viſible, when the profeſſion of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent faith, which it receiued from the Apoſtles, did faile in it, and when, and by whom the profeſſion of a new faith began in it. As we can ſhew whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where, &amp; by whom, this new (no) faith of theirs began.</hi>

                     <hi>Certainly it is not poſſible, if ſuch a thing as this had happened, but that it ſhould haue bene reſisted, or at leaſt recorded by ſome. For ſuppoſe it were true, (which the Proteſtantes imagine)</hi>

                     <hi>that ſome points of the faith and religion which Rome profeſſeth at this day, were as contrarie to that which was in it, when Saint Paule commended the Romane faith, as black to white, darkneſſe to light; or ſo abſurd, as were now</hi> Iudaiſme, <hi>or</hi> Paganiſme <hi>(as one of their</hi>

Then I would demaund, if it were poſſible, that any Prince in any Chriſtian Citie, and much more that the Pope in Rome the mother Citie, could at this day bring in any notable abſurd rite of Iewiſh or Paganiſh reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; for example, to offer vp an Oxe in ſacrifice, or to worſhip a Cow as God: and not onely to practiſe it priuately in his owne Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, but to get it publickely practiſed and preached in all Churches, not onely of that Citie, but alſo in all the reſt of the Chriſtian world: and that none ſhould in Chriſtian zeale, continually oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that no Biſhop ſhould preach, no Doctor write againſt this horrible innouation of faith, and the author thereof; that none ſhould haue conſtancie to ſuffer martyrdome, which Chriſtians haue bene alwaies moſt readie to endure, rather then to yeeld to a profeſſion and practiſe, ſo contrarie to their ancient faith; that there ſhould be no true hearted Chriſtians, who would ſpeake of it, or at leaſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it, nor no Hiſtoriographer that would ſo much as make ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure mention of it. Could all be ſo aſleepe, that they could not note, or ſo cold and negligent in matters concerning their ſoules good, as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, without any care to yeeld vnto it? No certainly, though there were no promiſe of Chriſt his owne continual preſence; no aſſurance of the infallible aſſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his holy ſpirit: yet it is not poſſible that ſuch a groſſe error ſhould ariſe among Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; ouerwhelme the whole world, without ſome reſiſtance. The Biſhops and Paſtors could not be ſo ſimple, or ſo vnmindfull of their duetie, but they would firſt note ſuch an euident contrarietie, to the ancient and vniuerſally receiued faith; and noting it, they would, doubtleſſe with common conſent, reſiſt, contradict, and finally, according to Saint Paule his</hi>

                     <hi>rule, accurſe it. If therefore this could not happen now, nor euer heretofore was heard, that any ſuch abſurd errour or hereſie did or could ariſe, without noting or reſiſting; what reaſon can any man</hi>
                     <pb n="371" facs="tcp:21012:195"/>
                     <hi>haue, to ſay, that this hath happened at Rome? Not being able to alledge any writer, that did note the thing, the perſon, the time, and what oppoſition was made and continued againſt it, as in all he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies that haue ſprung vp of new, we can do. If there could not a little ceremonie be added to the Maſſe, but that it was ſet downe in hiſtorie, when and by whom; how could the whole ſubſtance of the Maſſe, (which conſisteth in conſecration, oblation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the ſacred Hoaſt) be newly inuented, and no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made, when or by whom, or that euer there was was any ſuch new inuention at all? If alſo Hiſtoriographers were not afraid to note perſonall and priuate vices of the Popes themſelues; which they might well thinke Popes would not willingly haue made open to the world: why ſhould they haue feared to haue recorded any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in religion? Which if it had bene, had bene a thing done publikely in the view of the whole world; or if there were any feare or flatterie, which might tie the tongues and pennes of thoſe, that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led neare hand, that they durſt not or would not mention ſuch a matter: yet doubtleſſe others, which liued in places further off, ſhould not haue had thoſe cauſes, and conſequently would not haue kept ſecret ſuch an open and important a thing as this. If laſtly the hiſtories which make mention of theſe priuate vices of Popes, and other Chriſtian Princes, could not onely firſt come out, but alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue without touch, till theſe latter times: what reaſon can any haue to doubt or dreame, but that the like would haue bene ſet out about the alteration of religion, if it had happened? And that, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch Hiſtorie reporting any true accident of alteration or change of religion, had come out; it ſhould partly by Gods prouidence, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by humane diligence, haue bene preſerued till theſe our daies: eſpecially conſidering, that ſuch records had bene ſo requiſite, for diſcerning the ancient, vnchanged, true Chriſtian Religion, from vpſtart noueltie, which muſt needs be falſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So that we may well conclude; that if Chriſtian Religion had, ſince the Apoſtles time, altered in Rome; it would haue bene recorded in hiſtories, as other things, and eſpecially ſuch notable alterations are recorded: and thoſe hiſtories would haue bene preſerued till this day, as other Christian monuments haue bene preſerued, euen in time of perſecution, yea euen then, when the perſecutors made</hi>
                     <pb n="372" facs="tcp:21012:196"/>
                     <hi>particular enquirie for Chriſtian bookes, to burne or conſume them. But in thoſe ancient Hiſtories, there is no mention made of any ſuch alteration of Religion in Rome. Wherefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that there was no ſuch alteration or change at all. No ſuch alteration being made, it is euident that the ſame faith and Religion, which was in Saint</hi> Paules <hi>time, hath alwaies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, and is there now. That which was there then, was the true faith and Religion, as appeareth by that high commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which Saint</hi> Paule <hi>hath left written of it. Therefore that which is there now, muſt needs be the</hi> onely <hi>true</hi> holy <hi>and</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke <hi>faith; and that companie which profeſſeth it, muſt needs be the</hi> Onely <hi>true</hi> Holy <hi>and</hi> Catholicke Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Neither can I ſee what anſwere can, with any probabilitie, be forged againſt this reaſon. For to ſay, that the errours of the Church of Rome crept in by little and little, and ſo, for the little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the thing, or for negligence of the Paſtours, were not eſpied; is an idle fiction alreadie refuted. For firſt thoſe matters, which the</hi> Proteſtants <hi>call errours in the Romane Church, be not ſo little matters, but that leſſe, euen in the like kinde, are ordinarily recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in ſtories. Nay, ſome of them are in the Proteſtants conceits, (and conſequently if men of old time had bene Proteſtants, they would haue bene alſo in their conceits) as groſſe ſuperſtition as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſme it ſelfe, namely to adore Chriſt our Sauiour, as being really and ſubſtantially preſent in the</hi> Bleſſed Sacrament; <hi>the which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament Protestants hold to be, (really and ſubstantially) but a bare peece of bread. Alſo the Protestants account the vſe of the Images to be Idolatrie, and ſay (verie ignorantly or maliciouſly) that we adore ſtockes and ſtones, as the</hi> Paynims <hi>did. The which things could not ſo haue crept in by little and little, but they muſt needs be eſpied: Neither could the Pastours of the Church, at any time, be ſo ſimple and ignorant, ſo ſleepie and negligent, but they must needes haue ſeene: and ſeeing must needes in ſome ſort haue reſisted, as before I haue ſaid. For to imagine all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, of any one age, to haue bene in ſuch a deepe</hi> Lethargicall <hi>and deadly ſleepe, that they could not onely not perceiue, when the enemie ſhould ouer ſow</hi> Cockle <hi>in the hearts of ſome; but alſo when this</hi> Cockle <hi>of falſe beleefe ſhould grow to outward</hi>

                     <hi>action, and eſpecially to publicke practiſe, the which could not be but moſt apparent: to imagine (I ſay) all the Paſtors to be ſo ſimple and ſleepie, not then to marke, or not to reſist, is rather the dreame of a proud man in his ſleepe, who is apt to thinke all men fooles beſide himſelfe, then a iudictall conceit of a waking man of any vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; who ought to thinke of things paſt, either according to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie recorded in ſtories, or when this faileth, by comparing the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood of that which hee thinketh was done by men of that time, with that which moſt men of their qualitie would do in like caſe.

But if you leaue this out, and affirme that Church to be Catholicke which is vniuerſall in doctrine, and thinke it not needfull, that the doctrine profeſſed be the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: I denie your maior. The reaſons of my deniall, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered in the former Chapter, when I ſhewed, that truth
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:21012:197"/>
of doctrine was the moſt proper and true marke of the Church.</p>
                  <p>But whatſoeuer your maior be, your minor is euidently falſe <note place="margin">To the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note> in euery part of it. The very foundations of the doctrine of the Apoſtles, are ouerthrowne by your Church, in the hereſies you hold concerning <hi>predeſtination, iuſtification, free will, the inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie of the Scriptures,</hi> and <hi>the headſhip of Antichriſt your Pope.</hi> Neither do you onely faile in the doctrine of the Apoſtles, but in your vniuerſalitie of time. For how can that doctrine be ſaid to haue bin always, which was not taught by our Sauiour and his Apoſtles? As for vniuerſalitie in regard of the ample vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of your doctrine; if you ſpeake of your Churches deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, many points of great moment are not as yet defined by it: for example take thoſe maine queſtions, whether <hi>the Pope be aboue the Councell or no:</hi> whether <hi>he haue without a Councell priuiledge of not erring or no:</hi> whether <hi>there be any merit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruitie or no,</hi> and ſuch like. Yea your Church denieth the chiefe point of all, which in the Apoſtles time was held by all true Chriſtians, that <hi>iuſtification is by faith, without the workes of the law.</hi> I forbeare to ſhew the reaſons of that I affirme, becauſe any man may ſetch them out of my former anſwer in this and the laſt Chapter.</p>
                  <p>I looked for proofe of your minor: but you were too wiſe to vndertake a matter ſo vnpoſſible: and therefore in ſtead of that, you challenge vs to ſhew and proue the contrarie, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that it is the repliers part to proue, and not the anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. But I pray you tell me in earneſt, did you neuer heare of any particulars, whereby we except againſt your doctrine as none of the Apoſtles? What a vaine flouriſh is this then, to demaund new proofes of vs, and neuer once aſſay to anſwer thoſe we haue alreadie brought? But I haue made anſwer to your chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge in my refutation of your proofe, that your Church is <hi>one.</hi> Yea our mens bookes are full of theſe points and proofes, both out of Scriptures and Fathers. As for your brag, of being able <hi>to ſhew diuers points that we hold or denie, otherwiſe then the true Church did in the time of the Apoſtles:</hi> it is well knowne, that in moſt controuerſies betwixt vs, you are faine to flie from the
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:21012:198"/>
Scriptures of God, to the writings of men, and deuiſe interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to ſerue your turne. In ſome points we denie not, but that we diſſent from the opinion of ſome writers of former a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; but that we go againſt the iudgement of the whole Church before it became Antichriſtian, neither we graunt, nor you can proue. And euen for thoſe times of error, we want not the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of learned men to auouch our doctrine againſt your he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies. But you call vpon vs <hi>to ſet downe the point of doctrine, the author, the time, the place, what companie did oppoſe themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, and who they were that did continue in the profeſſion of the former faith.</hi> What needs all this ado? Wil it not ſerue the turne, if we make it manifeſt, that your doctrine is contrary to that the Apoſtles taught, vnleſſe we can ſhew you when euery one of your errors was firſt hatched? What if the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes had demaunded the like queſtions of our Sauiour Chriſt, touching their errors reproued by him? There is no doubt, but that as he was God, he could haue declared euery one of theſe particulars; but do you thinke he would haue fed their fooliſh humor in this caſe, and not haue contented himſelfe with ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it was not ſo from the beginning? <note n="b" place="margin">D. Abbot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt D. B.

Is it a good plea againſt plaine and ſound euidence, whereby I proue that ſuch a Lordſhip ought to be mine, that I cannot ſhew when and how I loſt the poſſeſſion of euery ſeuerall cloſe and meadow, farme and cottage? But to take away all iuſt excuſe from you, our writers haue ſhewed the firſt beginnings of many of your errors, and might haue done of more, if al were extant that hath bin written; and your inquiſitors and cenſurers had not (as you call it) purged, indeed corrupted and maimed the writings of former ages, whereſoeuer they made againſt you, if you could light on them before they were too well knowne in the world.</p>

This challenge hath as much reaſon as the former.

Surely the Greeke Church euen till this day, diſſenteth from you in many, and ſome no ſmall matters, as your Popes ſupremacie; that I may not name thoſe Chriſtians who are in precious Iohns countrey, in Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, <note place="margin">Jean.

                     <hi>If there could not a little ceremonie be added to the Maſſe, but that it was ſet downe in historie; how could the whole ſubſtance of the Maſſe be newly inuented, and no mention made of it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This conſequence is weake. For thoſe additions to the Maſſe were matters enioyned by your Popes, and recorded by your writers of Hiſtories, not as errours, but as vertues, to the commendation of the Authors thereof, the world growing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie day more and more ſuperſtitious, and yet there are ſome ceremonies, &amp; other patches of your Maſſe, about the Author
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:21012:202"/>
wherof there is no great agreement to be found in your writers of hiſtories. But the ſubſtance of your Maſſe was long comming in, and the words themſelues in it, hauing bene deuiſed to no ill purpoſe, were at at laſt occaſion of errour vpon errour; as it is worthily declared, by <note n="g" place="margin">Lord Pleſſy of the Maſſe.</note> the Lord Pleſſy in his booke of the Maſſe, to which I referre all men, that deſire to be ſatisfied in this matter, and where (I dare vndertake) they may finde good ſatisfaction. The learned know of themſelues, how to haue it alſo otherwhere, in the writings of our diuines, <note n="h" place="margin">D. Sutliu. de Miſſa.</note> Doctor Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliffe, and diuers other.</p>
                  <p>Your latter obiection carrieth ſome more ſhew of likelihood with it, in this ſort.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If Hiſtoriographers were not afraid to note perſonall and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate vices of the Popes themſelues, why ſhould they feare to record any alteration in religion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Do you not know why? Or can you not diſcerne the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in this caſe? Of whom ſhould they be afraid? Your Popes for the moſt part, were ſo notoriouſly lewd, that all, your Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers write of them, was well knowne to the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they writ, ſo that they could not for ſhame, but ſay in a manner, as much as they did. But the chiefe matter was, that the latter Popes had quarrels to their predeceſſors, which was verie ordinarie: and then it was not onely ſafe, but as it were meritorious, to diſplay their villany to the world; or at the leaſt, they might imagine that the vices of their predeceſſors would ſerue for a foile to their vertues. Sometimes alſo it fell out, that the Pope in verie ciuill honeſtie, had a deteſtation of ſuch bad courſes as other before him had taken; &amp; that gaue men ſome liberty to write more freely. But your change of doctrine nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could eaſily, nor might at all be diſcouered, becauſe it was a priuitie of your eſtate, and a principle of your religion, with <note place="margin">Arcanum rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicae.</note> your Pope and Prelates, that <hi>Saint Peters vicar could not erre in doctrine.</hi> As for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in other countries, who knoweth not, how few monuments of antiquitie remaine? Or who ſuſpecteth not iuſtly, that they haue come through huckſters handling, as in diuers it is more then apparent? Yet are there alſo diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords in the writings of learned men, wherein any man may ſee
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:21012:202"/>
direct oppoſition to many points, held at this day in your Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church.</p>
                  <p>After many idle repetitions, turnings and windings, at the laſt you are lighted vpon a part of our anſwer, that thoſe errors and abuſes, crept in by little and little vnperceiued. For replie whereto you ſay, <hi>it is an idle fiction already refuted.</hi> How idle then is this new diſcourſe of yours, againſt a point, which you haue ouerthrowne before? But you knew well enough, for all your ſaying, that it asked further help, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you could yet affoord it. Well, what ſay you at the laſt? iuſt nothing at all to purpoſe. For what though the matters be of great moment, and leſſe points noted by ſome writers? We ſpeake not of that, but of the ſmal difference from the truth, which at the firſt appeared in the bringing in, and beginning of your hereſies. A matter of ſmall importance, being apparently contrary to that, which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally held to be true, ſhall find more to note and reſiſt it, then an errour in the very foundation of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo cloſely carried that it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not at the firſt be perceiued. You giue vs two exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of very important matters, the Maſſe and Images. But you offer not to ſhew, that they brake out all at once, to the height of impietie: No, no, they came in by degrees, vnder a colour of reuerence, and helpe to further men in deuotion. I wittingly for beare to enter into diſcourſe of theſe points, becauſe I ſhould be too long, and the matter is already performed very excellently by that honorable perſonage the Lord Pleſſy: <note n="i" place="margin">Pleſſy of the Maſſe. lib. 1. chap. 6. 7. 8.</note> for the Maſſe in his firſt booke, <note n="k" place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 2. 3. 4.</note> and for Images in his ſecond. <note n="l" place="margin">See our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the perill of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I may not forget to anſwer the imputations you charge vs withal. Firſt concerning the Sacrament, you confidently auouch that <hi>we hold it to be (really and ſubſtantially) but a bare peece of bread.</hi> Wherein you ſhew that, wherewith afterward you charge vs about Images, either <hi>your ignorance,</hi> or <hi>your malice.</hi> By <hi>Sacrament</hi> we vnderſtand, according to the truth, the whole action of bleſſing, giuing, receiuing the bread and wine. The bread which you call <hi>the Sacrament,</hi> is but part of the matter of <hi>the Sacrament.</hi> But what? Do we make this bread, to <hi>be really and ſubstantially bare bread?</hi> Surely, for the nature of it, we ſay and are ſure, that it neuer ceaſeth to be bread, till
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:21012:203"/>
it be digeſted in the ſtomacke. But for the vſe, we acknowledge it, ſo farre as it is vſed, to be <hi>holy bread,</hi> and not <hi>bare bread, bread appointed, bleſſed, and made effectuall by God,</hi> to ſeale vp in our hearts the aſſurance of his loue, in giuing his ſonne for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, reſting vpon him by faith for pardon. Indeed we do not, as you do, blaſphemouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call the bread our Creator, or God; vpon a conceit, that (forſooth) the ſubſtance of the bread, is either vaniſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, or elſe turned into the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt, to be torne in peeces with our teeth, or ſwallowed downe into our bellies, and from thence beſtowed in a worſe place. This ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and monſtrous opinion hath bene, and is amongſt you, the cauſe of the moſt groſſe and barbarous idolatrie, that euer was committed in the world.</p>
                  <p>It is neither ignorantly nor malitiouſly done of vs, to charge you, for adoring ſtocks and ſtones, as the Paynims did. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the things, and the worſhip, and then ſhew me a true diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Are not your Images of wood, gold, ſtone, as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles were? Haue they not the ſhape and proportion of men and women, as theirs had? Do not you worſhip them, as diuers of the Heathen were wont to do? You <note n="m" place="margin">

<pb n="387" facs="tcp:21012:203"/>
this maketh no difference in worſhip. The heathen, at leaſt the learned and wiſer ſort of them, did not hold their Idols to be Gods, but repreſentations of their Gods. And you Papiſts, in making them mediators of interceſſion, and ſo acknowledging but one God, do little better then the Pagans: for they had but one ſoueraigne God Iupiter, who commaunded all the reſt. Not onely <hi>Dij minorum gentium,</hi> their Gods of the third and fourth forme, but alſo thoſe of the ſecond and firſt, as <hi>Hercules, Apollo, Venus,</hi> yea and <note n="q" place="margin">Virgil Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neid. lib. 12.</note> Iuno her ſelfe too, who was both wife and ſiſter to Iupiter, depended vpon him, and were glad to be mediators of interceſſion to him for their fauorites: as is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie where to be ſeene in <hi>Homer,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgil.</hi> All the difference of any moment, that I perceiue, is, that ſome of the heathen Gods, were imagined to be ſuch by nature; and all your Diui or Saints, pety-gods, haue both their places and offices by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour. But I am wearie of theſe abhominations and fooleries of yours.</p>
                  <p>The Paſtors of the Church being imployed in withſtanding manifeſt and dangerous hereſies, neither did nor could, though they ſlept not, perceiue and reprooue euery errour; yea it is more then likely, that they were content to beare with many things, as long as the maine points were held ſoundly: leaſt by ſtriuing for matters of leſſe weight, greater things ſhould be neglected, and they that erred in ſmall things, vpon reſiſtance, quite fall away to ioyne with the heretickes. This in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, for ſome fiue hundred yeares, was the eſtate of the Church. And afterward plentie bred pride and idleneſſe: the chalices were turned into gold, and Prieſts into wood or lead, that partly ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; partly ſlothfulneſſe gaue the diuell op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie to ſow what errours he would in the middeſt of the Church.

                     <hi>Now to make an end, conſidering all this which I haue ſaid and prooued, to wit, that there is but one, infallible, entire faith, the which is neceſſarie to ſaluation, to all ſorts of men: the which faith euerie one muſt learne by ſome knowne, infallible, and vniuerſall rule, accommodate to the capacitie of euerie one: the which rule cannot be any other but the doctrine and teaching of the true Church: the which Church is alwaies to continue viſible vntill the worlds end, and is to be knowne by theſe foure markes,</hi> Vna, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta, Catholica, Apoſtolica, One, Holy, Catholicke, Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke: <hi>the which markes agree onely to the Romane Church, (that is to ſay, to that companie, which doth communicate, and agree in profeſſion of faith, with the Church of Rome:) whereupon follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that this Church or companie is the onely true Church, of which euerie one muſt learne that faith which is neceſſarie to ſaluation. Conſidering (I ſay) all this, I would demaund of the Protestants, how they can perſwade themſelues, to haue that faith, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to ſaluation, ſith they will not admit the authoritie and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church, of which onely they ought to learne this faith? Or how they can (as ſome of them do) challenge to themſelues the title of the true Church, ſith their companie hath neuer one of the foure markes, which by common conſent of all, muſt nedes be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged for the true markes of the Church? How can their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation be the true Church, which neither is</hi> One, <hi>becauſe it hath no meanes to keepe vnitie? nor</hi> Holy, <hi>becauſe neither was there euer any man of it, which by miracle or any other euident teſtimony, can be prooued to haue bene truly holy: neither is their doctrine ſuch as thoſe that moſt purely obſerue it, do without faile, thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come holy: nor Catholicke, becauſe it teacheth not all truths, that haue bene held by the vniuerſall Church in former times, but deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth many of them; neither is it ſpred ouer all the Chriſtian world,</hi>

How can they then brag that they haue the true, holy, Catholicke, and Apoſtolicke faith; ſith this is not found in any companie, that differeth in doctrine, from the onely true, holy, Catholicke, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicke Church?

Which bidding when Ozias contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and would not obey, he was preſently ſtricken with a leproſie, and then being terrified, feeling the puniſhment inflicted by our Lord, he haſtened away, as in the ſame place is declared.

For though the prieſthood of the Paſtors of the new law be not Aaronicall; yet it agreeth with the Prieſthood of Aaron, (according to S.

So that we haue not (I ſay) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any to be ſent of God to feed vs, with the food of true doctrine of faith, but ſuch onely, as come in this ordinarie manner; (as it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that Luther and Caluin, when they left their former profeſſion, and tooke vpon them to preach this new faith, did not come viſibly, called, conſecreated and ſent, for this purpoſe, by any lawful authority, according to the ordinary manner:) or if it ſhould pleaſe God to ſend any one in extraordinary manner, it appertaineth to his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to furniſh him with the gift of miracles, as he did his Sonne our Sauiour Chriſt; or with a miraculous conceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; with ſtrange and extraordinary ſanctity of life, as was ſeene in S.

And this ſame may well be obiected to any priuate man, or any few, who leauing the Kings broad ſtreet, or beaten hye way of the Catholicke Church, will ſeeke out a by-path, as being in their conceit, a better, eaſier, &amp; more direct way to heauen.

I muſt needs thinke, that ſith there is but one right way, and that the way of the Catholicke Church is a ſure and approued ſafe way, you are very vnaduiſed, who with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture of the irreparable loſſe of your deareſt and peerleſſe treaſure your ſoule, will leaue this ſafe and ſecure way, to ſeeke out a new vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine and perillous way. I muſt needs think, ſith the Catholick Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church is (as I haue proued) the light of the world, the rule of faith, the pillar &amp; ſure ground of truth: that you leauing it, leaue the light, and therefore walke in darkneſſe; forſaking it, forſake the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect path of true faith, and therefore are miſled in the miſt of incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie, into the wilderneſſe of miſbeleefe: and finally that you hauing thus loſt the ſure ground of truth, do fall into the miry ditch of many abſurdities, and muſt needs be drowned in the pit of innumerable errors; and erring thus from the way, the veritie and the life, which is Chriſt Ieſus reſiding, according to his promiſe in the Catholicke Church, muſt needs (vnleſſe you wil, which I hartily wiſh, returne to the vnitie of the ſame Church) incur your owne perdition, death and damnation of body and ſoule: from which ſweet Ieſus deliuer you, and vs all, to the honor and perpetuall praiſe of his holy name. Amen.</hi>

                  <head>A. W.</head>
                  <p>To theſe idle queſtions of yours, I anſwer firſt in generall, that we may with reaſon enough perſwade our ſelues that we haue the true faith and true Churches; becauſe we ſee, that the very quinteſſence of Bellarmines ſophiſtry diſtilled againe in your limbeck, is of no force to purge out or alter ſuch perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. This appeares in the particulars viewed and examined. To which I anſwer ſeuerally in a word: The doctrine of the true Church we gladly admit and receiue, yet not vpon the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie thereof, but becauſe it is agreeable to the Scriptures. If you ask vs then, why we are perſwaded that we haue true faith; we returne you anſwer, that we are therefore ſo perſwaded, becauſe we finde that which we beleeue auowed in Scripture, and confirmed in our hearts by the witneſſe of the holy Ghoſt. Hereupon we conclude (as well we may) that we are members of the true Church, &amp; our congregations true Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> churches. For wheras you charge ſome of vs, but craftily forbeare to name them, with chalenging to our ſelues the title of the true Church; <note place="margin">See my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to 12. art part. 1. art. 5.</note> it is a ſlaunder of yours, and no challenge of ours; ſaue only thus far, that we affirme there is no true Church, which agreeth not with vs in the fundamentall points of the Goſpell. But we are far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> appropriating the Church to our congregations, as if all true Churches depended vpon vs, according to that you teach of your Romiſh ſynagogue. And whereas you condemne vs for no true Churches, becauſe we want the markes of true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: we ſay that you take thoſe for markes, which are not ſo, as you vnderſtand them; and farther, that euery one of them rightly conceiued, is to be found in our ſeuerall congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</p>
                  <p>It is one, becauſe it holdeth that one meanes of ſaluation preached by the Apoſtles, euen faith in Ieſus Chriſt, without mingling of any workes therewith of the ceremoniall or moral law, before or after grace, to deſerue iuſtification of congruitie, or euerlaſting life of condignitie. The contrary errors held by your ſynagogue, make and proue it to be no true Church. But how fooliſh is the reaſon you bring againſt vs? <hi>The Proteſtants Church is not one, becauſe it hath no meanes to keepe vnitie.</hi> It hath meanes ſufficient, viz. the truth of the Scriptures, and teaching
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:21012:213"/>
of the ſpirit of God. Put caſe it wanted meanes to continue v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie; would it follow thereupon, that it is not One? Surely no more, then that a man is not aliue, becauſe he hath not means to keepe himſelfe aliue.</p>
                  <p>Our Church hath had, and by the bleſſing of God hath many holy men and women, whoſe workes haue giuen, and dayly do giue cleare teſtimonies of their inward graces. Indeed we want vnholy legendaries, to deuiſe and publiſh monſtrous lies for miracles, by which you haue gotten the aduantage of vs, in the conceits of them, <hi>to whom God hath ſent ſtrong deluſions, that they might beleeue lies.</hi> But wiſedome is iuſtified of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, though you proud Phariſes deſpiſe her.</p>
                  <p>Our doctrine teacheth nothing but holineſſe: that <hi>we were</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>choſen to be holy:</hi> that <hi>we are freed from our ſinnes, to the end we might ſinne no more:</hi> that <hi>we are waſhed, iuſtified and ſanctified by the bloud of Chriſt; buried with him in baptiſme, that we might die to ſinne; raiſed from ſinne to righteouſneſſe, by the power of his reſurrection:</hi> that <hi>holines of life is a part of our glorie, without which no man ſhall euer ſee God:</hi> that <hi>he which ſaith he is iuſtified, and ſhewes himſelfe to be vnſanctified, deceiues his owne ſoule, and is in the ſtate of damnation:</hi> Onely we neither giue the glorie of our ſaluation to our ſelues, as if by the power of our freewill, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeciall inclination thereof by the holy Ghoſt, we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued faith, which other men haue refuſed: though they might haue embraced it as well as we, for ought God did for or to vs, more then for or to them; nor looke to merit heauen by the worthineſſe of our workes, as if it were the wages of ſeruants, and not the inheritance of children.</p>
                  <p>The vniuerſal Church (as you ſpeake of it) is a meere name, without any thing anſwerable to it in nature. That which was generally held (while the Churches of Chriſt were not ſubiect to Antichriſt) concerning the ſubſtance of Religion, by which true and falſe Churches are to be iudged, we gladly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly maintaine. The errors which ſome men defended, and corrupted the Churches withall, we refute and reiect. But it is no marke of the true Church, to hold all that hath bene gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally maintained in true Churches; but the dutie of it to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:21012:214"/>
for true, whatſoeuer was taught by the Apoſtles, and is recorded in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>How far our Church is ſpread, it paſſeth your skill truly to affirme: and we may with good reaſon perſwade our ſelues, that it is in all places, where the Goſpell is preached, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures knowne; becauſe dayly experience ſheweth, that it hath ſome members in thoſe countries where your bloudie and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous butchery of Inquiſition doth moſt rule, and vnder the noſe of your grand Antichriſt, in the citie of Rome. But it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make it <hi>Catholicke,</hi> that it acknowledgeth it ſelfe to be common both to Iew and Gentile, not tied to any country, people or perſon whatſoeuer, as yours is to the Pope and Rome.</p>
                  <p>We are not aſhamed of Martin Luther, whom it pleaſed God to vſe admirably, if not miraculouſly, to rake from vnder the aſhes the light of the Goſpell, couered and choked with your errors and ſuperſtitions. Not as if it had bin al that while out of the world, but as <note n="g" place="margin">12. art. part. 1. art. 1.</note> one of your owne fellowes ſpeakes of it, as <hi>being in the eclipſe,</hi> ouerſhadowed and darkned with the thicke miſt of your Popiſh decrees, decretals, and ſchoolmens trickes, and other ſuch leud trumpery. Our Church, that is the true Church of Chriſt was all that time in the world, but not to be ſeene of euery man: though from time to time there were ſtill found ſome who durſt maintaine the truth of Chriſt againſt your Antichriſtian hereſies. Luthers writings, words, deeds, and manner of death, were ſuch as might manifeſt to all men both his true zeale of the glory of God, and Gods eſpeciall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to him, whatſoeuer ſuch lying ſycophants as Prateolus faine.</p>
                  <p>If we would ſtand vpon Apoſtolickneſſe in ſucceſſion, what haue you, that we want; ſaue onely that you continue in ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of error, longer then we do? But it is an idle plea, to auouch perſonall ſucceeding, where there is manifeſt contrarietie in doctrine: by which, as we heard out of <note n="h" place="margin">
                        <hi>Tertul. de praeſc. cap.</hi> 32.</note> Tertullian, howſoeuer you brag of Apoſtolickneſſe, you may be proued not to be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall.</p>
                  <p>We differ not in doctrine, touching the fundamentall points
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:21012:214"/>
of Religion, from any true, holy, Catholicke, and Apoſtolicke Church: neither doth your ſynagogue agree with any ſuch. Therfore wheras you demand, how we can brag that we haue true faith, which is not to be found out of the true Church; we anſwer you, as oft we haue done, that we are ſure the faith we hold is true, becauſe it is agreeable to the Scriptures, and being ſo, we cannot be out of the true Church, as long as we are in the true faith.</p>
                  <p>True faith cannot be had by any light or diſcourſe of nature, but onely by reuelation from God. For <note n="i" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>neither eye hath ſeene, nor eare hath heard, nor the heart of man can imagine, what the meanes are, whereby God decreed in himſelfe to ſaue thoſe whom he hath choſen to glory.</hi> Now it was not the purpoſe of God in theſe latter times, as in the firſt before the law, to reueale his will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly from heauen; but he ſent his Son in the nature of man, and that Sonne his Apoſtles, to giue knowledge of thoſe means of ſaluation; both by preaching for that preſent age wherein they liued, and alſo by writing, for that age, and all that were to ſucceed till the end of the world. This is all that the Apoſtle tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth <note n="k" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 16.</note> in the place alledged by you. Yet we denie not, that the principall ordinary means to bring men to faith, is the miniſtery of man, by word of mouth expounding the word &amp; wil of God according to the Scriptures. Firſt then, all men to whom the Scriptures are vouchſafed, haue meanes of hearing. For in them they may, if they will, heare men appointed by God, ſpeake to their inſtruction and ſaluation. Secondly, the ſame God hath ordained, that beſides the former teaching, there ſhould be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine men ſet apart and deputed for the miniſtery, whoſe dutie it is to preach in their ſeuerall charges the word of truth. This ſetting apart &amp; deputing, is that ſending which is now required; and is to be performed by ſuch as are, &amp; ſhall be authorized to that purpoſe. Thirdly for our particular caſe, we are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that Luther and theſe other worthies, by whoſe miniſtery it pleaſed God to reuiue the knowledge of the Goſpell decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were authorized to preach by your congregation, which was at that time in apparence the true Church of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were they ſent, if your church haue any ſending: and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:21012:215"/>
to their calling, they labored in opening the truth of God, as it is reuealed in the Scriptures. Thus by the gracious mercie of God, it came to paſſe, that they teaching the word of truth, found diuers, both men and women, whoſe hearts the Lord by his ſpirit opened, ſo that they embraced the loue of the truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered by them, and accepted them for their paſtors, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelues to become their flockes. By this meanes they had both a generall authoritie to preach, from that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, which (by profeſſion) was the Church, and alſo a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular charge of thoſe who were now become indeed (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their profeſſed faith) a true Church of God. We haue then in our Churches, for the late reforming of them, firſt, your calling, ſuch as it was, and ſecondly the approbation of true Chriſtians, of which true Churches conſiſt. Therefore by your owne rule, ſince we haue ſome amongſt vs that are ſent, we may alſo haue faith and true faith, though we abhor your Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian hereſies.</p>
                  <p>To what purpoſe is this idle diſcourſe, but to ſhew your owne errors? We neither looke for, nor allow any opinion of extraordinary ſending from God, becauſe we haue no warrant for any ſuch in the Scriptures. But wee ſay, the reſtorers of the Goſpell, in this laſt age, had ordinary allowance of that Church which bare the ſhew of the true Church, and profeſſed the beleeuing of the Goſpell, which is the foundation of the Church.</p>
                  <p>But you require peculiar conſecration, becauſe it pleaſed God to appoint ſuch a courſe for the Prieſthood of the Law. Do you not know, that the conſecrating and annointing of Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, was a part of the ceremoniall law, ſignifying the annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the ſpirit, which our Sauiour was to receiue: to whom, according to thoſe ſhewes, <note n="l" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioan.</hi> 3. 34.</note> the Lord gaue the ſpirit without meaſure? The conſecration that now remaines, is nothing but the ſetting a part of ſome men for the worke of the miniſterie by prayer and laying on of hands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="m" place="margin">2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 26 18.</note> Your example of Oziah, is little to the purpoſe. For it had not bene lawfull for him to offer incenſe, though he had bene conſecrated with all the ceremonies that belong to the office
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:21012:215"/>
of the prieſthood, becauſe the office of offring incenſe was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated by God to the houſe of Aaron, as Azariah ſignifieth in his ſpeech to Vzziah. This appointment of God was their calling: <note n="n" place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4.</note> the outward ceremonies were but to ſhadow forth the excellencie of our Sauiour Chriſts prieſthood. Neither doth the Apoſtle prooue the lawfulneſſe of Chriſts prieſthood, by his conſecration anſwerable to Aarons, as your alledging of the place intends, but onely by the Lords authorizing of him to that office. <note n="o" place="margin">

                  <p>You proceed to heape error vpon error, to the preiudice of Gods truth, and deſtruction of his people.

Neither was the preſeruation of the people, but their owne aduancement the marke they ſhot at. But the true ſhepheard Ieſus Chriſt came to giue his life for his ſheepe, that they might be ſaued. This is the true ſenſe of that worthy ſermon; which if we will apply to miniſters, they muſt be held for true Paſtors, which being authorized thereunto, do preach Chriſt Ieſus truly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mingling any ſuch doctrines as may by any meanes draw vs from the acknowledging or reſting vpon him for ſaluation. He that ſo teacheth and is authorized thereunto, commeth in by Chriſt the doore, eſpecially if he haue withall a true deſire to feed the flock committed to him, in the ſinceritie of his heart.

Many in former times haue bene partakers of the like mercie, and bene made wiſe to ſaluation by the ſame truth we now profeſſe: yea it was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally held many hundred yeares, til your maſter Antichriſt draue it into holes and deſerts. After the reuealing of his pride and tyrannie: the true way to heauen ceaſed not to be found, though not ſo commonly, till it pleaſed God to ſcatter thoſe clowdie miſts of ignorance and idolatrie, by which you had hidden it, that it could very hardly be knowne. Diuers heretofore, and more now adaies finde fauour with God to diſcerne and walke through it, to the certaine, and euerlaſting ſaluation of their ſoules and bodies. So iudge we as it becommeth vs in chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our forefathers: that he which hath looked in compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vpon vs their ſeed, did not faile to ſhew mercy vnto them, who neuer vnderſtood the myſterie of your iniquitie: but in the ſingleneſſe of their hearts embraced the generall doctrine of the Goſpell, concerning ſaluation by faith in Chriſt. This is the onely way, by which all men haue gone, that euer came to heauen, and in this way we trauell with danger of <hi>the liues of our bodies</hi> (as you ſpeake) becauſe we are continually in hazard by reaſon of your conſpiracies, treaſons, maſſacres, vndermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and fier-works; but with aſſurance of the ſaluation of our ſoules: if we hold faſt the ſhoot-Anchor of our hope, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing our owne righteouſneſſe, repoſe our ſelues by faith vpon the gracious mercy of God our Father in Ieſus Chriſt. This doing we haue better certificate, both for the ſecuritie of our way, and the end of our iourney out of the Scriptures, and by the witneſſe of the Spirit of God in our hearts, then that lying Carier the diuel can bring by any ſhew of your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit miracles whatſoeuer.</p>
                  <p>I muſt needs perſwade my ſelfe, ſith that Apoſtolicall Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Synagogue is (as I haue ſhewed) the ſeducer of the world by ſhew of authority, without reaſon, the ouerthrow and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction

of truth, by denying the ſufficiency of the Scripture, and taking the vſe of it from the people of God; that all you which cleaue to it, plunge your ſelues in helliſh darkneſſe, by refuſing to ſee the light of Gods word; and by drinking of the cup of abhomination preſented to you by that ſtrumpet of Rome, looſe the taſte of truth, and runne forward in wilfull ignorance, to moſt certaine damnation. The Lord is my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whom I ſerue weakly as I can, in the Goſpell of his Son Ieſus Chriſt, that if it were poſſible and lawfull for me, I could be content to procure your ſaluation, by pouring out my heart bloud for euerie one of you, that Ieſus Chriſt my maſter might haue the glory of your true conuerſion. To that purpoſe, and for the eſtabliſhing of them, which alreadie beleeue: I firſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke, and haue now at the laſt (by the mercifull aſſiſtance of God) finiſhed my anſwer to this ſubtill Treatiſe. Let me now earneſtly intreat you by the care of your owne ſaluation, by the zeale you haue (in ignorance) to glorifie God, by the infinite loue of Ieſus Chriſt, by the vndeſerued mercy of God the Father, by the continuall gracious motions of the holy Ghoſt, and by whatſoeuer is, or ought to be deare vnto you, that you would vouchſafe ſeriouſly in the ſinceritie of your hearts, without preiudice to conſider; whether it be not more ageeable both to the Scriptures, and the light of reaſon, to giue the whole glorie of our ſaluation to the mercie of God in Ieſus Chriſt, then to aſcribe the enabling of vs to ſaue our ſoules to God, and the vſe or imploying of this abilitie to the choiſe of our owne free-will. If your opinion be true, <note n="n" place="margin">See my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to 12. Art. part. 2. art. 4.</note> euerie man that is ſaued, is more beholding to himſelfe, then to God for his ſaluation. For though he haue power from God, to be ſaued, if he will: yet neither hath he this power, but vpon preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, depending on his free-will; and when he hath it, the vſing of it well is from himſelfe, and not from God. You will ſay, he could not vſe it well, vnleſſe he were aſſiſted continually by the grace of God. I anſwer, that for all this aſſiſtance by that grace to vſe it well, the well or ill vſing of it, when God hath done all, he will do, ariſeth from the choiſe of a mans owne will. That it was poſſible for me to be ſaued, it was Gods doing:
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:21012:218"/>
that this poſſibilitie tooke effect in me, I may thanke my ſelfe, more then God: ſo that by this doctrine, the glorie of euerie particular mans ſaluation is more due to the partie ſaued, then to God the Sauiour. Now on the contrarie ſide; if that we teach be true, the loſſe falles on mans part, and not vpon Gods. Is any man drawne out of the Iawes of hell and damnation? The whole glorie redounds to God. It was he that prouided meanes of ſaluation: it was he that gaue me, in particular, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that meanes. It was he, that when I was as vnto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and vnwilling to be ſaued, as the moſt damned repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, wrought me to beleeue (can I euer be vnmindfull or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull!) by inclining my heart to like, and accept of his grace, and faith in Chriſt. But in the meane while I looſe the commendation, and the glory of vſing the grace of God well, by my free-will. O Adam, Adam, earth and aſhes, how faſt doth that pride of nature, whereby thou waſt deſtroyed in thy ſelfe, though in thee it were not naturall, cleaue to euerie one of thy poſteritie! <note n="o" place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 5. 6.</note> We had rather be thought able to gouerne our ſelues, then be gouerned by God. It is more pleaſing to vs, to hazard our ſaluation vpon the nice choiſe of our owne free-will, then to be aſſured of it, by the mercie of God, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in vs this choiſe to will. O that, as we are all partakers of Adams pride, ſo we might alſo partake with his repentance and faith! Would Adam (trow ye) if it might be put to his choiſe, againe venture vpon his owne free-will, though he were as pure as euer he was, rather then reſt ſecure vpon Gods almightie, and moſt certaine protection? No, no, bleſſed ſoule, he knoweth by wofull experience (though by Gods vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able goodneſſe, to his and our greater glorie) that he, and he only is out of danger, who reſignes himſelfe into Gods hands, to be diſpoſed of at his gracious pleaſure. Why refuſe we to be like to Adam in this? Will we follow him in that onely, of which onely he is aſhamed? Is it not more glorie to ariſe with him, then to haue falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with him? O why do we euery day renew the memorie of his fault, by committing the like! Doth the brightneſſe of the truth in theſe points dazle your eies? Me thinks I ſee many of you offering to preſſe forward, as it were
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:21012:219"/>
to take the kingdome of heauen, the doctrine of the Goſpell, by violence: why recoile you? Why quaile you on a ſodaine? The bare name of <hi>the Church,</hi> not onely ſtayeth you, but bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth you backward. The Romiſh Church cannot erre. VVho telleth you ſo? Surely they, that can erre, your Prieſts and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits. Giue me leaue I pray you, to queſtion with you a little, and for a minute of an hower, be content to make vſe of that reaſon and knowledge, which God hath giuen you, without foreſtalling your iudgements, by preiudice of the authoritie of the Church. Doth it not appeare to you by the light of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reaſon, that the maine end of all religion is the glorie of God? Do not your owne conſciences teſtifie in the ſimplicitie of your hearts, that it maketh more for the glorie of God, that men ſhould be beholding to his Maieſtie for their ſaluation, then that they ſhould procure it to themſelues? Is it not alſo apparent to you in the ſecret of your owne ſoules, that our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by beating downe the pride of mans free-will, aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the glorie of Gods mercie: and yours, by hoyſing vp the conceit of mans good choiſe, preſſeth downe the eſtimation of Gods vnſpeakable goodneſſe? And ſhall an idle ſound weigh more with you, then ſound reaſon? Conſider, I beſeech you, what weake grounds you build this opinion of the Church vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I will point at that, which in my anſwer I haue handled. Can you in any ſort compare the opinion of the Churches au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, with the euidence of thoſe matters, wherewith before I preſſed you? Is it as cleere that there are certaine men, whom I muſt beleeue, whatſoeuer they teach, as it is, that I muſt ſeeke the aduancing of Gods glory, more then of mine owne pride? Are you as ſure, that theſe Prieſts and Ieſuits which are your teachers, be ſent by the true Church, and deliuer nothing, but the doctrine of the true Chruch; as you are, that they, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to reſt wholy vpon God, and not at all vpon your ſelues, ſhew you the right way to procure Gods glory, and your owne ſaluation? Tuſh (ſay you) all is nothing vnleſſe I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it, vpon the credit of the Church. Alaſte, how did the firſt Chriſtians, who neuer thought on the authoritie of the Church, when they heard and beleeued the Apoſtles doctrine?
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:21012:219"/>
Looke ouer all the Hiſtorie of the Actes, peruſe the Sermons of Peter and Paule, and tell me whether you finde, that euer they pleaded the authoritie of the Church, to procure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe of their doctrine. After men are conuerted, the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Church, hath her due place, and muſt beare ſway in matters in different, but for the auowing of truth, her bare word is neuer of ſufficient importance. It was the doctrine of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, that wrought vpon the hearts of men, by the cleare eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it, through the power of the Spirit, wherewith it was accompanied. What that doctrine was, where ſhould we learne but in the ſcriptures, wherein they haue written what they preached? Theſe (you ſay) giue ſuch authoritie to the Church. This were ſomewhat, if you made not their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in reſpect of vs, to depend vpon the Church. <hi>The ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> (ſay <note n="p" place="margin">

The Church muſt be beleeued vpon her word. Why ſo? The Scripture ſaith ſo. How ſhall I know that theſe bookes are ſcripture? The Church ſaith ſo. The Church and the ſcripture prooue each other, by their mutuall teſtimonie, they giue each of other: I beleeue the Church becauſe the ſcripture biddeth me, I beleeue the ſcripture, becauſe the Church biddeth me. If theſe things ſeeme to be abſurd, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are moſt abſurd, blinde not your ſelues any longer with ſuch miſts of errour, but come out of them, to the cleare light of the ſcriptures: reade them diligently, meditate in them carefully, call vpon God for his grace earneſtly, reſigne your ſelues, and your free-will to him ſincerelie: and the Lord that is moſt readie to bleſſe them, that vſe the meanes of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and faith, in humilitie, and ſingleneſſe of heart, will aſſuredly enlighten your vnderſtanding, and incline your affections, that you ſhall diſcerne, like of, and embrace the true doctrine of Iuſtification by faith in Ieſus Chriſt: and ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce your owne righteouſneſſe, and free-will, to the glorie of his grace, and the preſent comfort, and euerlaſting ſaluation
