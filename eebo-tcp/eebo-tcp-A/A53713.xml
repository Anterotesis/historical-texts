            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Reasons of this delay, being not of publicke concernment, I shall not need to mention. Those who have been in expectation of this duty from me, have for the most part been so farre acquainted with my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and employments, as to be able to satisfy themselves, as to the deferring of their desires. That which I have to adde at present is only this; having had many opportunity's, since the time I first delivered any thing in pulicke on this Subject, (which was the meanes of bringing me under the engagements men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) to reassume the consideration of what I had

first fixed on, I have been inabled to give it that improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to make those additions to the main of the designe and matter treated on, that my first debt, it come at length to be only the occasion of what is now tendred to the Saints of God. I shall speak nothing of the subject here handled; it may I hope speak for it selfe, in that spirituall savour and rellish which it will yeild to them, whose hearts are not so filled with other things, as to render the sweet things of the Gospell bitter to them. The designe of the whole Treatise, thou wilt find Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Reader, in the first Chapters of the first part: and I shall not detaine thee here with the perusall of any thing which in its proper place will offer it selfe unto thee: know only, that the whole of it hath been recommended to the Grace of God in many supplications, for its usefull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse unto them that are interested in the Good things mentioned therein.</p>

               <p>It is so also in Reference unto the <hi>Son:</hi> Joh: chap: 14. v: 1. <label type="milestone">

So also John chap. 9. v. 36. yea the distinct affixing of Faith, <hi>affiance</hi> and confidence on the Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God, as the Son of God; is most frequently pressed. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>God</hi> (that is the Father) <hi>so loved the World that whosoever believeth on him</hi> (that is the Sonne) <hi>should not perish.</hi> The <hi>Sonne,</hi> who is given of the <hi>Father</hi> is believed on. <hi>He that believeth on him, is not condemned</hi> v. 18. <hi>He that believeth on the Sonne hath eternall life;</hi> v. 36.

               <p>Further! that <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> acting themselves in all <label type="milestone">

Which yet is set forth with more Glory, chap. 5. v. 8. <hi>The foure living creatures, and the foure and twenty Elders fell down before the Lambe, having every one of them Harpes, and Golden Vials full of Odours, which are the prayers of Saints.</hi> and v. 13, 14. <hi>Every creature which is in Heaven, and on earth, and under the Earth, and such as are in the Sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessings, Honour, Glory, and Power, be unto him that sitteth on the throne, and unto the LAMBE for ever and ever.</hi> The <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Sonne,</hi> He that <hi>sits upon the throne,</hi> and the <hi>Lambe,</hi> are held out joyntly, yet distinctly as the adequate object of all divine <hi>Worship</hi> and Honour, for ever and ever. And therefore <hi>Stephen</hi> in his solemne <hi>dying</hi> Invocation, fixeth his <hi>Faith</hi> and Hope distinctly on him: Acts 7. 59, 60. <hi>Lord Iesus receive my spirit,</hi> and <hi>Lord lay not this sinne to their charge;</hi> for he knew, that the <hi>Sonne of man</hi> had power to forgive sinnes also. And this worship of the Lord Jesus, the Apostle makes the discriminating character of the Saints: 1 Cor. chap. 1. v. 2. <hi>With all</hi> (saith he) <hi>that in every place call upon the name of Iesus Christ</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 56. 7. Rom. 10. 12, 13, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>our Lord, both theirs and ours;</hi> that is, with all the Saints of God. And Invocation generally comprizes the whole <hi>worship</hi> of God. This then is the due of our Mediator, though <hi>as</hi> God, as the Sonne, <hi>not</hi> as Mediator.</p>
               <p>Thus also is it in reference unto the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of Grace. The closing of the great sinne of <hi>unbeliefe,</hi> is still described as an <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>12</label> opposition unto, and a <hi>resisting</hi> of that Holy Spirit. And you <note place="margin">Acts 7. 51.</note> have distinct mention of the <hi>Love of the Spirit</hi> Rom. chap. 15.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60108:9"/>
v. 13. The Apostle also peculiarly directs his supplication to him, in that Solemne benediction, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 14. <hi>The Grace of the Lord Iesus Christ, the Love of God, and the Communion of the Holy Spirit be with you.</hi> All such benedictions are originally supplications. He is likewise entitled unto all <hi>instituted</hi> worship, from the Appointment of the Administration of <hi>Baptisme</hi> in his name Math. 28. 18. Of which things more afterwards.</p>
               <p>Now of the things which have been deliver'd, this is the <hi>Sum:</hi> There is no grace whereby our soules goe <hi>forth</hi> unto God, no <hi>Act</hi> of divine worship yeilded unto him, no duty or obedience performed, but they are <hi>distinctly</hi> directed unto Father, Sonne, and Spirit: Now by these and such like wayes as these, doe we hold Communion with God: and therefore we have that Communion <hi>distinctly,</hi> as hath been described.</p>
               <p>This also may farther appeare, if we consider how <hi>distinctly</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. When the <hi>same</hi> thing is attributed <hi>severally</hi> and singly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to each person.

Instance, which is very comprehensive, and may be thought to comprize all other particulars; and this is <hi>TEACHING.</hi> The <hi>Teaching</hi> of God, is the reall Communication of <hi>all</hi> and every particular Emanation from himselfe unto the Saints, whereof they are made partakers. That promise, <hi>they shall be all taught of God,</hi> enwrapps in it selfe the whole <hi>Mystery</hi> of Grace, as to its <hi>actuall</hi> dispensation unto us, so farre as we may be made reall <hi>possessours</hi> of it.

               </p>

only true, but TRUTH it selfe, is only the holy Spirit of God: so that he teacheth also; being <hi>given unto us, that we may know the things that are freely given to us of God:</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 15. I have chosen this speciall Instance, because as I told you, it is <hi>comprehensive,</hi> and comprizes in it selfe most of the particulars that might be annumerated: <hi>Quickning, preserving,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This then farther drives on the Truth that lyes under De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration; there being such a <hi>distinct Communion of Grace from the severall persons of the Deity,</hi> the Saints must needs have <hi>distinct</hi> Communion with them.</p>
               <p>It remaineth only to intimate in a word, <hi>Wherein</hi> this distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Father</hi> Communicates all Grace by the way of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall Authority. He Quickneth</hi> WHOM HE WILL.

And upon what account he hath the dispensation of that fullnesse to him committed, you may see Phil: 2. 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>When thou shalt make his soule an Offering for sinne, he shall prolong his dayes, and the Pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand, He shall see of the Travaile of his soule and be satisfied, by his knowledge shall my righteous Servant justifye many, for he shall beare their Iniquityes.</hi> Isa. chap. 53. v. 10, 11.

It is bestowed on us by the <hi>Father: It is not of our selves, it is the gift of God:</hi> Eph. chap. 2. v. 8. It is the <hi>Father</hi> that revealeth the Gospell, and Christ therein: Math. chap. 11. v. 25.

of the former Generall Assertion: Otherwise there is no <hi>Grace,</hi> or duty wherein we have not <hi>Communion</hi> with God in the way described.

               <p n="4">4. By asserting this distinct <hi>Communion,</hi> which <hi>merely</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects that order in the dispensation of Grace, which God is <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>5</label> pleased to hold out in the Gospell, I intend not in the least, to shut up all <hi>Communion</hi> with God under these precincts, (his ways being <hi>exceeding broad,</hi> containing a perfection whereof there is no end) nor to prejudice that <hi>holy fellowship</hi> we have with the whole Deity, in our walking before him in <hi>Covenant obedience,</hi> which also (God assisting) I shall handle hereafter.</p>
               <p>These few observations being <hi>premised,</hi> I come now to declare <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>6</label> what it is, wherein peculiarly and eminently the Saints have Communion with the <hi>Father:</hi> And this is <hi>LOVE.

This is the great <hi>discovery</hi> of the Gospell.

Esa. 33. 15, 16. Hab. 1. 13. Psal. 5. 4, 5, 6. Ephes. 2. 3.

Shew us the Father and it shall suffice: Iohn 14. 8. Now this ought to be so farre a way, that his <hi>Love</hi> ought to be looked on as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine from whence all other sweetnesses flow. Thus the Apostle sets it out, Titus chap. 3. v. 4. <hi>After that the kindnesse and Love of God our Saviour toward man appeared.</hi> It is of the <hi>Father</hi> of whom he speakes; for v. 6. he tells us, that he makes out unto us, or <hi>sheds that love upon us abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour.</hi> And this Love he makes the <hi>Hinge,</hi> upon which the great Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and Translation of the Saints doth turne: for (saith he) v. 3. <hi>We our selves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasurs, living in malice, and envy, hatefull, and hating one another.</hi> All naught, all out of Order, and Vile, Whence then is our Recovery? The whole <hi>rise</hi> of it is from this Love of God, flowing out by the wayes there described. For <hi>when the kindnesse and love of God appeared,</hi> that is, in the fruits of it, then did this alteration ensue. To secure us hereof, there is not any thing that hath <hi>a loving</hi> and tender nature in the world, and doth act suitably thereunto, which God hath not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himselfe unto. Separate all <hi>weaknesse</hi> and impefection which is in them, yet great impressions of <hi>love</hi> must abide. He is as a <hi>Father,</hi> a <hi>Mother,</hi> a <hi>Sheaphard,</hi> an <hi>Hen</hi> over <hi>Chickins,</hi> and the like. Psal. 103. 13. Isa. 63. 16. Math: 6. 6. Isa: 66. 13. Psal: 23. 1. Isa. 40. 11. Math: 23. 37.</p>

We are then (I say) to <hi>Eye</hi> it, to <hi>believe</hi> it, to <hi>receive</hi> it, as in him; the Issues and fruits thereof, being made out unto us, through Christ alone. Though there be no <hi>Light</hi> for us, but in the <hi>Beames,</hi> yet we may by the Beames see the <hi>sunne,</hi> which is the Fountaine of it. Though all our Refreshment actually lye in the <hi>streames,</hi> yet by them we are led up unto the <hi>fountaine.</hi> Jesus Christ, in respect of the <hi>love</hi> of the Father, is but the <hi>Beame,</hi> the <hi>Streame,</hi> wherein though <hi>actually</hi> all our Light, our Refreshment lyes, yet by him we are lead to the <hi>Fountaine,</hi> the <hi>Sunne</hi> of Eternall Love it selfe.

               <p>This is that which is aymed at. Many darke and <hi>disturbing</hi> thoughts are apt to arise in this thing. Few can carry up their

hearts and minds to this <hi>height</hi> by faith, as to rest their <hi>soules</hi> in the Love of the Father; they live below it, in the troublesome Region of hopes and feares, stormes and clouds. All here is <hi>serene</hi> and quiet. But how to attain to this <hi>pitch</hi> they know not. This is the will of God, that He may always be <hi>eyed</hi> as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne, Kind, Tender, <hi>Loving,</hi> and unchangeable therein: and that peculiarly as the <hi>Father,</hi> as the great fountaine and spring of all gracious Communications, and fruits of Love. This is that which Christ came to reveale: God as a <hi>Father,</hi> John 1. 18. That <hi>name</hi> which he declares to those who are given him out of the world, John 17. 6. And this is that which he <hi>effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> leads us to by himselfe, as he is the <hi>only way</hi> of going to God, as a Father: <hi>John</hi> 14. 5, 6. that is, as <hi>Love:</hi> And by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, gives us the <hi>rest</hi> which he promiseth: for the Love of the Father is the only rest of the soule. It is true as was said, we doe not this <hi>formally</hi> in the first instant of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. We believe in God through Christ. 1 Pet. 1. 21. Faith seeks out <hi>rest</hi> for the soule. This is presented to it by Christ, the <hi>Mediator,</hi> as the only <hi>procuring</hi> cause. Here it <hi>abides</hi> not, but by Christ it hath an <hi>accesse</hi> to the Father, Ephes. 2. 18. into his Love, finds out that he is Love, as having a designe, a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of Love, a good pleasure towards us from eternity; A <hi>delight,</hi> a <hi>complacency,</hi> a good will in Christ; all cause of <hi>Anger,</hi> and Aversation being taken away. The soule being thus by <hi>Faith</hi> through Christ, &amp; by him brought into the <hi>bosome</hi> of God, into a comfortable <hi>perswasion,</hi> and spirituall <hi>perception</hi> and sense of his love, there reposes and rests it selfe.

John 3. 33. John 5. 21. John 10. 17. Iohn 15. 9. Iohn 17. 24. And we are said through him to <hi>believe in,</hi> and to have <hi>accesse</hi> to God.</p>

                  <hi>of the world;</hi> but in the pursuit of that Love, he <hi>blesseth us with all Spirituall blessings in Heavenly places in Christ.</hi> Ephes. chap. 1: v. 3, 4. From his love, he <hi>sheds, or powers out the Holy Spirit richly upon us, through Jesus Christ our Saviour,</hi> Titus chap. 3. v. 6. In the <hi>powring</hi> out of his love, there is not one <hi>drop</hi> falls besides the Lord Christ. The holy annointing <hi>Oyle,</hi> was all powred on the head of <hi>Aaron:</hi> Psal. 133. v. 2. and thence went down to the <hi>Skirts</hi> of his cloathing. Love is first <hi>powred</hi> out on Christ; &amp; from him, it drops as the <hi>dew of Hermon</hi> upon the Soules of his Saints. The Father will have him to <hi>have the preheminence in all things,</hi> Col. 1. 18. <hi>it pleased him that in him, all fullnesse should dwell,</hi> v. 19. <hi>that of his fullnesse we might receive, and Grace for Grace.</hi> John 1. v. 16. Though the Love of the Fathers purpose and good pleasure, have its <hi>rise</hi> and <hi>Foundation</hi> in his meer Grace and will, yet the designe of its <hi>accomplishment</hi> is only in Christ. All the <hi>fruits</hi> of it, are first given <hi>to</hi> him; and it is <hi>in</hi> him only that they are dispensed to us. So that though the Saints <hi>may,</hi> nay <hi>doe</hi> see an infinite <hi>Ocean</hi> of Love unto them in the Bosome of the Father, yet they are not to look for one <hi>drop</hi> from him, but what comes through Christ. He is the only meanes of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. Love in the Father, is like <hi>Honey</hi> in the <hi>Flower?</hi> it must be in the <hi>Combe,</hi> before it be for our use. Christ must extract and pepare this <hi>Hony</hi> for us. He drawes this water from the <hi>Fountaine,</hi> (through union and dispensation of fullnesse) we (by <hi>Faith)</hi> from the <hi>wells of Salvation</hi> that are in him. This was in part before discovered.</p>

               <p>2. There are sundry things wherein they <hi>differ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>The Love of God is a Love of Bounty, our Love unto him is a Love of Duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Love</hi> of the <hi>Father</hi> is a Love of <hi>Bounty,</hi> a descending Love. Such a Love as carryes him out to doe <hi>good things</hi> to us, <hi>great things</hi> for us. His love lys at the <hi>Bottome</hi> of all dispensations towards us: and we scarse any where find any mention of it, but it is held out as the cause and Fountaine of some <hi>free gift,</hi> flowing from it. <note n="e" place="margin">John 3. 16.

It is the love of a <hi>Spring,</hi> of a <hi>Fountain,</hi> always Communicating. <note n="g" place="margin">Amor Dei est infundens &amp; creans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatem in amatis. <hi>Th: p. p: q:</hi> 20. <hi>A:</hi> 2. <hi>C.</hi>
                  </note> A love from whence proceeds every thing that is <hi>lovely</hi> in its object. It infuseth into, and <hi>creates</hi> Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the persons beloved; and this answers the discription of love given by the Philopher: To love saith he, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="2">2. Our Love unto God, is a <hi>Love of Duty:</hi> the Love of a <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>21</label> Child. His love <hi>descends</hi> upon us in <hi>Bounty</hi> and Fruitfullnesse; <note n="h" place="margin">Amor Dei causat boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, sed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor noster causatur ab ea.</note> our love <hi>ascends unto him,</hi> in <hi>Duty</hi> and Thankfullnesse. He addes to us by his Love, we nothing to him by ours. Our goodnesse extends not unto him. Though our Love be fixed on him <note n="i" place="margin">Dilectio quae est appetativae uirtutis actus, etiam in statum viae tendit in Deum primo &amp; immediate: <hi>Th.</hi> 22. q. 27. a. 4.</note> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, yet no fruit of our love reacheth him immediately,

though he <hi>requires</hi> our Love, he is not <hi>benefited</hi> by it, Job. 35. 5, 6, 7, 8. Rom. 11. 35. Job. 22. 2, 3. It is indeed made up of these four things. 1. <hi>Rest,</hi> 2. <hi>Delight,</hi> 3. <hi>Reverence,</hi> 4. <hi>Obedience.</hi> By these doe we hold Communion with the <hi>Father</hi> in his love. Hence God calls that <hi>Love</hi> which is due to him as a <hi>Father,</hi> honour: <hi>Malac.</hi> chap. 1. v. 6. <hi>If I be a Father, where is mine Honour?</hi> It is a deserved act, of <hi>Duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. They differ in this: <hi>The Love of the Father unto us is an</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>22</label> 
                  <hi>Antecedent love, Our Love unto him is a Consequent Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. The love of the <hi>Father</hi> unto us is an <hi>Antecedent</hi> love, and that in two Respects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is antecedent in Respect of our <hi>love:</hi> 1 John 4. 10. <hi>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us.</hi> His <hi>love</hi> goes before ours. The <hi>Father</hi> loves the <hi>child,</hi> when the <hi>child</hi> knowes not the <hi>Father;</hi> much lesse loves him. Yea we are by nature <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 30. haters of God: He is in his own nature <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; a lover of men: and surely all mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all love between him and us, must begin on his <hi>hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In respect of all other <hi>Causes</hi> of love whatever. It goes not only before our <hi>Love,</hi> but also any thing in us, that is <note n="k" place="margin">Ezek. 16. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. &amp;c. Rom. 9. 11, 12 Tit. 3. 3, 4, 5, 6 Deut. 7, 6, 7, 8 Mat. 11. 25, 26. Joh. 3, 16.</note> lovely. Rom. 5. 8, <hi>God commendeth his love toward us, in that whilest we were yet sinners Christ died for us:</hi> Not only his <hi>Love,</hi> but the eminent fruit thereof, is made out towards us, as <hi>sinners.</hi> Sin holds out all of <hi>unlovelinesse,</hi> and undesirablenesse, that can be in a Creature. The very mention of that, removes all causes, all moving occasions of Love whatever. Yet <hi>as such,</hi> have we the Commendation of the Fathers Love unto us, by a most signall Testimony. Not only when we have done no good, but when we are in our <hi>blood,</hi> doth he love us. Not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are <hi>better</hi> then others; but because himselfe is <hi>infinitely</hi> good. His kindnesse appeares when we are <hi>foolish</hi> and <hi>disobedient.</hi> Hence he is said to <hi>love the world,</hi> that is, those who have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is in, and of the world, whose whole, <hi>lyes in evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Our love is <hi>consequentiall</hi> in both these regardes. 1. In Respect of the <hi>Love of God.</hi> Never did Creature turne his <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>23</label> towards God, if the heart of God were not first set upon him. 2. In Respect of <hi>sufficient</hi> causes of Love. God must be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed</hi> unto us as <hi>lovely</hi> &amp; <hi>desireable,</hi> as a fit &amp; suitable object unto the soule to set up its Rest upon, before we can beare any <hi>love</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:60108:17"/>
unto him. The Saints (in this sense) doe not <hi>love God for nothing,</hi> but for that <hi>Excellency,</hi> Lovelinesse, and desireablenesse that is in him. As the Psalmist says in one particular, Psal. 116. 19. <hi>I love the Lord BECAUSE!</hi> so may we in generall, we love the Lord <hi>BECAUSE!</hi> Or as <hi>David</hi> in another case, <hi>what have I now done, is there not a cause?</hi> If any man <hi>enquire</hi> about our love to God, we may say, what have we now done, is there not a <hi>cause?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. They differ in this also. <hi>The Love of God is like himselfe, equall, constant, not capable of Augmentation, or Diminution: Our love</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>24</label> 
                  <hi>is like our selves, unequall, increasing, waining, growing, declining.</hi> His like the <hi>Sunne,</hi> always the same in its light, though a cloud may sometimes interpose: Ours, as the <hi>Moon,</hi> hath its Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and streightnings.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Love</hi> of the <hi>Father</hi> is <hi>Equall</hi> &amp;c. <note n="m" place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 29 Isa. 46. 70. Jerem. 37. 3. Mal. 1. 6. Jam. 1. 17. 2 Tim. 2. 19.</note> whom he loves he loves unto the end, and he loves, them always alike. <hi>The</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>25</label> 
                  <hi>strength of Israel is not a man that he should repent.</hi> On whom he fixes his love, it is <hi>immutable:</hi> it doth not grow to <hi>Eternity,</hi> it is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished at any time. It is an <hi>eternall love,</hi> that had no <hi>beginning;</hi> that shall have no ending; that cannot be heightned by any act of ours, that cannot be lessened by any thing in us; I say in it self it is thus, otherwise in a two fold regard it may admit of chang.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In respect of its <hi>Fruits;</hi> It is (as I said) a <hi>fruitfull</hi> love, a <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>26</label> love of Bounty. In reference unto those fruits, it may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be <hi>greater,</hi> sometimes <hi>lesse:</hi> Its communications are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Who among the Saints, finds it not? What <hi>Life,</hi> what Light, what strength sometimes? and againe how <hi>dead,</hi> how dark, how weake, as God is pleased to let out, or to restraine the fruits of his Love? All the Graces of the <hi>spirit</hi> in us, all san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified enjoyments whatever, are <hi>fruits</hi> of his love. How vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously these are <hi>dispensed,</hi> how differently at sundry seasons, to the same Persons, experience will abundantly testify.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In respect of its <hi>discoveries</hi> and manifestations. <hi>He sheds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad</hi>

                  <hi>his Love in our Hearts by the Holy Ghost:</hi> Rom: 5 v. 5. gives us a <hi>sense</hi> of it; manifests it unto us.

Our Father will not alwaies <hi>chide,</hi> lest we be cast downe; he doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies <hi>smile,</hi> lest we be full and neglect him: but yet still his Love in its selfe is the same.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There are few <hi>Truths</hi> of Christ, which from some, or other, have not received like entertainment with this. Termes and <hi>Appellations</hi> are at the <hi>Will</hi> of every imposer: things are not at all varied by them. The <hi>Love</hi> of God in it selfe, is the <hi>eternall purpose</hi> and act of his Will. This is no more changeable, then God himselfe. If it were, no <hi>flesh</hi> could be saved: but it <note n="o" place="margin">Mal. 3. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> not, and we are not consumed. What then! loves he his people in their sinning? Yes, his <hi>People,</hi> not their sinning.

He <hi>rebukes</hi> them, he <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stens</hi> them, he <hi>hides his face</hi> from them, he <hi>smites them,</hi> he fills them with a sense of indignation; but <hi>woe, woe</hi> would it be to us, should he change in his love, or take away his <hi>kindnesse</hi> from us: Those very things which seem to be demonstrations of the <hi>change</hi> of his Affections towards his, do at clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Love, as those which seem to be the most genuine Issues thereof. <hi>But will not this encourage to sinne?</hi> He never tasted of the Love of God, that can <hi>seriously</hi> make this objection. The <hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> may be turned into wantonesse, the <hi>Principle</hi> cannot: I shall not wrong the Saints, by giving other answer to this objection. <hi>Detestation</hi> of sinne in any may well consist, with the <hi>Acceptation</hi> of their persons, and their <hi>designation</hi> to life eternall.</p>
               <p>But now, our <hi>Love</hi> to God, is <hi>ebbing</hi> and flowing, <hi>waining</hi> and <note place="margin">§. 28. <hi>g</hi> Revel. 2. 5, &amp; 3 2. Ephes. 3. 16, 17, 18, 19.</note> increasing. We <hi>lose</hi> our first Love, and we grow again in Love. Scarse a day at a stand. What poore creatures are we? how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the <hi>Lord</hi> and his Love? <hi>unstable as Water, we cannot excell:</hi> now it is! <hi>though all men for sake thee, I will not:</hi> anon, <hi>I know not the man.</hi> One day, I shall <hi>never be moved,</hi> my hill is so strong; the next, <hi>all men are lyers,</hi> I shall perish.

Assure thy selfe then, there is nothing more acceptable unto the <hi>Father,</hi> then for us to keep up our <hi>hearts</hi> unto him, as the <hi>eternall</hi> fountaine of all that rich Grace, which flowes out to sinners in the blood of Jesus. and,</p>

neglect of this Duty, even of holding Communion with the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> in Love? So much as we see of the Love of God, so much shall we delight in him, and no more.

                  <hi>Eminency and Priviledge of the Saints of God.</hi> What low thoughts soever the <hi>Sons</hi> of men may have of them, it will appeare that they have <hi>meat to eate that the World knowesnot of:</hi> they have <hi>close communion</hi> and <hi>fellowship</hi> with the Father, They deale with him in the <hi>enterchange</hi> of love. Men are generally esteemed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>company</hi> they keep. It is an <hi>Honour</hi> to stand in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Princes, though but as Servants. What Honour then
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60108:22"/>
have all the Saints, to stand with boldnesse in the presence of the <hi>Father,</hi> and there to enjoy his Bosome love. What a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing did the <hi>Queen of Sheba</hi> pronounce on the Servants of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> who stood before him, and heard his Wisdome. How much more blessed then are they, who stand continually before the <hi>God</hi> of Solomon, hearing his <hi>Wisdome,</hi> enjoying his love? Whilest others have their fellowship with <hi>Sathan,</hi> and their own <hi>Lusts,</hi> making provision for them, and receiving <hi>perishing</hi> refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from them, (whose end is destruction, whose God is their <hi>Belly,</hi> and <hi>whose Glory is in their shame,</hi> who <hi>mind earthly things;)</hi> they have this sweet Communion with the Father.</p>
               <p>Moreover; what a safe and <hi>sweet retreat</hi> is here for the Saints, <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>censures,</hi> and <hi>tongue-persecutions</hi> which the Saints meet withall in the streets of the World, they may runne with their moanings unto their <hi>Father,</hi> and be comforted. <hi>As one whom his Mother comforteth, so will I comfort you,</hi> (saith the Lord) Isa: 66. v. 13. So that the Soule may say, if I have <hi>hatred</hi> in the World, I will goe where I am sure of Love: though all <hi>others</hi> are hard to me, yet my <hi>Father</hi> is tender, and full of compassion: I will goe to him, and satisfy my selfe in him: Here I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>vile,</hi> frowned on, and rejected, but I have <hi>honour</hi> and Love with him, whose <hi>kindnesse is better then Life it selfe.</hi> There I shall have all things in the <hi>Fountaine,</hi> which others have but in the dropps: there is in my Fathers Love, every thing desirea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: there is the <hi>sweetnesse</hi> of all mercies in the abstract it selfe, and that fully, and durably.</p>
               <p>Evidently then, the <hi>Saints</hi> are the most <hi>mistaken</hi> men in the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>18</label> world. If they say, <note n="n" place="margin">Joh. 1. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>come</hi> &amp; have <hi>Fellowship</hi> with us; are not men ready to say; why, what are you? a sorry company of <note n="*" place="margin">Act: 17. 6. 28. 22.</note>

But alasse! how are men mistaken? <hi>truely, their Fellowship is with the Father:</hi> let men think of it as they please, they have close, spirituall, Heavenly Refreshings in the <hi>mutuall</hi> Communication of Love
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60108:22"/>
with the Father himselfe; How they are generally <hi>misconceived,</hi> the Apostle declares 2 Cor. chap. 6. v. 8, 9, 10. <hi>As deceivers, and yet true, as unknown, yet well known, as dying and behold we live, as chastened, and not killed, as sorrowfull, yet always rejoysing, as poore yet making many rich, as having nothing, yet possessing all things:</hi> And as it is thus <hi>in Generall,</hi> so in no one thing more then this, that they are looked on as <hi>poore, low, despicable</hi> persons, when indeed they are the only <hi>great</hi> and <hi>noble</hi> Personages in the world. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Company they keep, it is with the <hi>Father,</hi> who so glorious? the Merchandise they trade in, it is <hi>Love,</hi> what so precious? doubtlesse they are the <hi>excellent</hi> on the Earth. Psal. 16. v. 3.</p>
               <p>Further; this will discover a maine difference between <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>19</label> the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>empty Professors.</hi> as to the Performance of <hi>Dutyes,</hi> and so the Enjoyment of outward Priviledges, <hi>fruitlesse Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors,</hi> often walk hand in hand with them: but now come to their secret <hi>retirements,</hi> and what a difference is there? there the Saints hold <hi>Communion</hi> with God; Hypocryts for the most part, with the <hi>world</hi> and their own Lusts, with them they converse, and Communicate: they hearken what they will say to them, and make <hi>provision</hi> for them: when the Saints are sweetly wrapt up in the <hi>Bosome</hi> of their Fathers Love. It is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes even almost impossible that <hi>Believers</hi> should in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>appearance</hi> goe beyond them who have very <hi>rotten</hi> hearts: but this <hi>meat</hi> they have which others know not of? this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment in the <hi>Banqueting</hi> house wherein others have noe share; in the multitude of their thoughts, the Comforts of God their Father refresh their Soules.</p>
               <p>Now then (to draw towards a close of this Discourse) if <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>20</label> these things be so, what manner of men ought we to be, in all <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>holy</hi> conversation? even <hi>our</hi> God is a consuming fire. What Communion is there between <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darknesse?</hi> Shall sinne and lust dwell in those <hi>thoughts</hi> which receive in, and carry out <hi>Love,</hi> from and unto the Father? Holinesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh his <hi>presence</hi> for ever. An unclean <hi>Spirit</hi> cannot draw nigh unto him; an <hi>unholy</hi> Heart can make no abode with him. A <hi>lewd</hi> Person will not desire to hold fellowship with a <hi>Sober</hi> man: and will a man of vaine and foolish <hi>Imaginations,</hi> hold communion and dwell with the most holy God? There is not
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60108:23"/>
any Consideration of this <hi>Love</hi> but is a powerfull motive unto <hi>Holinesse</hi> and leads thereunto. <hi>Ephraim</hi> says, what have I to doe any more with <hi>Idols,</hi> when in God he finds Salvation. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the <hi>Father</hi> is wholly inconsistent with loose wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. If we say that we have <hi>followship</hi> with him, and walke in <hi>darkenesse,</hi> we lye, and doe not the truth, 1 Joh. 1. 6. He that saith I <hi>know him</hi> (I have Communion with him) and <hi>keepeth not his Commandements, is a liar and the truth is not in him,</hi> chap. 1. v. 4. The most specious, and glorious <hi>pretence</hi> made to an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Father, without <hi>holinesse</hi> and Obedience to his Cammandements, serves only to prove the <hi>pretenders</hi> to be lyars. The love of the <hi>world</hi> and of the <hi>Father,</hi> dwell not toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>And if this be so, (to shut up all) how many that goe under the name of <hi>Christians</hi> come short of the Truth of it? How <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>unacquainted</hi> are the Generaliy of Professors, with the <hi>Mystery</hi> of this Communion, and the fruits of it? Doe not many very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently hold Communion with their <hi>lusts</hi> and with the world, and yet would be thought to have a Portion and Inheritance among them that are Sanctifyed? They have neither <hi>new name</hi> nor <hi>white stone,</hi> and yet would be called the people of the most High. May it not be said of many of them, rather that <hi>God is</hi> not in all their thoughts, then that they have <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> with him? The Lord open the Eyes of men that they may see and know that walking with God is a matter not of forme, but power.

The Lord Christ is excedingly delighted in <hi>tasting</hi> of

the sweet <hi>fruits</hi> of the Spirit in the Saints. Hence is that prayer of the <hi>Spouse</hi> that shee may have something for his <hi>Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> when he commeth to her. Cant. 4. 16, <hi>Awake O North-Wind, and come thou South, blow upon my Garden, that the Spices thereof may flow out, let my beloved come into his Garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.</hi> The Soules of the Saints are the <hi>Garden</hi> of Jesus Christ, the good ground Heb. 6. 7, 8. A <hi>Garden</hi> for <hi>delight:</hi> he rejoyces in them, his delights are with the Sons of Men: Prov. 8. 31. and he rejoyces over them: Zeph 3. 17. And a Garden for <hi>fruit,</hi> yea pleasant fruit, So he describes it: Cant. 4. 12, 13. 14. <hi>A Garden inclosed is my sister my Spouse, a spring shut up, a Fountaine sealed; thy Plants are an Orchard of Pomgranates with pleasant fruits, Camphire with Spicknard, Spicknard and Saffron, Calamus, and Cyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, with all trees of Frankincense, Mirrbe, and Aloes; with all chiefe fruits.</hi> Whatever is sweet and delicious for <hi>tast,</hi> whatever sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury and <hi>odoriferous,</hi> whatever is usefull and <hi>medicinall,</hi> is in this Garden. There is all manner of <hi>Spirituall refreshments</hi> of all kinds whatever, in the <hi>Soules</hi> of the Saints for the Lord Jesus. On this account is the <hi>Spouse</hi> so earnest in the prayer mentioned for an <hi>increase</hi> of these things, that her beloved may <hi>sup</hi> with her as he hath promised.

All other <hi>sons,</hi> either Angells, the Sons of God by Creation Job. 1. 6. 38. 7. or the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> the best of his off-spring, the Leaders of those companys, which <hi>v.</hi> 2. are called <hi>Daughters;</hi> or Sons of the old Creation, the toppe <hi>branches</hi> of all its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable things, are to an <hi>hungry, weary</hi> soule, (such alone seek for shade and fruit) but as the fruitlesse, leafelesse trees of the Forrest, which will yeild them neither <hi>food</hi> nor Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In Christ, saith shee, there is <hi>fruit,</hi> fruit sweet to the Tast. Yea his <hi>flesh</hi> is meat indeed, and his <hi>blood</hi> is drink indeed Joh. 6. 55. Moreover he hath brought forth that everlasting <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,</hi> which will abundantly satisfy any hungry, soule after it hath gone to many a <hi>barren Tree</hi> for food, and hath found

                  <hi>Drinketh</hi> of, shall thirst no more. Oh how sweet are the fruits of Christ's mediation to the faith of his Saints.

               <p>The Lord Christ, the Eternall Wisdome of the Father, and who of God is made unto us Wisdome, erects a <hi>spirituall-house,</hi> wherein he makes provision for the entertainment of those <hi>Guests</hi> whom he so freely invites.

               <p>THe next thing that comes under <hi>consideration,</hi> is, the <hi>Way</hi> whereby we hold <hi>communion</hi> with the Lord Christ, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>1</label> in respect of that <hi>personall</hi> Grace whereof we have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Now this the <hi>Scripture</hi> manifests to be by the <hi>way</hi> of a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugall Relation:</hi> He is <hi>married</hi> unto us, and we unto him; which spirituall Relation is attended with suitable <hi>conjugall</hi> affections. And this gives us <hi>fellowship</hi> with him, as to his personall excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies.</p>
               <p>This the <hi>Spouse</hi> expresseth Cant: 2. v. 16. <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his.</hi> He is <hi>mine,</hi> I possesse him, I have interest in him, as <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>my Head,</hi> and <hi>my Husband:</hi> and I am his, <hi>possessed</hi> of him, <hi>owned</hi> by him, given <hi>up</hi> unto him, and that as to my beloved in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugall Relation.</p>
               <p>So Isa: 54. v. 5. <hi>Thy maker is thine Husband (the Lord of hosts is his name) and thy Redeemer the holy one of Israel, the God of the whole Earth shall he be called</hi> This is yeelded as the Reason, why the <hi>Church</hi> shall not be <hi>ashamed</hi> nor confounded, in the middest of her <hi>Troubles</hi> and Trialls, shee is <hi>married</hi> unto her Maker, and her Redeemer is her <hi>Husband.</hi> And Isa. ch: 61. 10. setting out the mutuall <hi>Glory</hi> of Christ and his Church in their walking toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he saith it is, as a <hi>Bridegroome decketh himselfe with ornaments, and as a Bride adorneth her selfe with Jewells:</hi> such is their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because such is their Relation: which he also farther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth ch. 62. v. 5 <hi>As the Bridegroome rejoyceth over the Bride, so shall thy God rejoyce over thee.</hi> As it is with <hi>such persons</hi> in the day of their <hi>Espousalls,</hi> in the day of the <hi>Gladnesse</hi> of their hearts, so is it with Christ and his <hi>Saints</hi> in this Relation: He is a <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> to them, providing that it may be with them, according to the state and condition whereinto he hath taken them.</p>
               <p>To this purpose we have his faithfull engagement Hos. ch. <label type="milestone">

2. v. 19, 20. <hi>I will (saith he) betroth thee unto me for ever, yea I will betroth thee unto mee in Righteousnesse, and in Judgement, and in loving kindnesse, and in mercies, I will even betroth thee unto me in faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> And it is the main designe of the Ministry of the Gospell to prevaile with men to <hi>give up themselves unto the Lord Christ,</hi> as he reveales his kindnesse in this engagement. Hence Paul tells the Corinthians, 1 Epist. ch. 11. v. 2. that he had <hi>espoused them unto one Husband,</hi> that he might present them as a <hi>Chast virgin unto Christ.</hi> This he had prevailed upon them for, by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospell, that they should give up themselves as a <hi>Virgin,</hi> unto him who had <hi>betrothed</hi> them to himselfe, as an <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is a <hi>Relation</hi> wherein the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> is exceedingly <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>delighted;</hi> and inviteth others to <hi>behold</hi> him in this his Glory. Cant. 3. 11. <hi>Go forth</hi> (saith he) <hi>O ye Daughters of Ierusalem, and behold King Solomon with the Crowne wherewith his Mother Crowned him, in the day of his Espousalls, and in the day of the Gladnesse of his heart.</hi> Hee calls forth the <hi>daughters of Jerusalem,</hi> all sorts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors to consider him in the <hi>condition</hi> of <hi>betrothing</hi> and espousing his <hi>Church</hi> unto himselfe: moreover he tels them that they shall <hi>find on him</hi> two things eminently upon this account.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Honour;</hi> it is the day of his <hi>Corenation,</hi> and his spouse is the <hi>Crowne,</hi> wherewith he is <hi>crowned.</hi> For as Christ is a <hi>Diademe</hi> of beauty, and a Crowne of Glory unto <hi>Syon,</hi> Isaiah, ch. 18. v. 5. So <hi>Syon</hi> also is a <hi>Diadem,</hi> and a <hi>Crowne</hi> unto him, Isa. ch. 62. v. 3. Christ makes this <hi>Relation</hi> with his Saints to be his <hi>Glory</hi> and his <hi>Honour.</hi> 2. <hi>Delight:</hi> The day of his <hi>Espousalls,</hi> of taking poore sinfull soules into his bosome, is the day of the <hi>gladnesse</hi> of his heart. <hi>John</hi> was but the friend of the <hi>Bridegroome,</hi> that stood and heard his <hi>voyce,</hi> when he was taking his <hi>Bride</hi> unto himselfe, and he rejoyced greatly, Ioh: ch. 3. v. 29. how much more then must be the <hi>joy</hi> and gladnesse of the <hi>Bridegroome</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, even that which is <hi>expressed</hi> Zeph. ch. 3. v. 14. He <hi>rejoyceth with Ioy, he joys with singing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the <hi>gladnesse</hi> of the heart of Christ, the joy of his soule, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>5</label> to take poor sinners into this <hi>Relation</hi> with himselfe. He rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the <hi>thoughts</hi> of it from Eternity, Prov. 8. 31. And alwaies expresseth the greatest <hi>willingnesse</hi> to undergoe the hard task re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired thereunto, Psal. 40. 7, 8. Heb. 10. 7, 8. yea he was
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60108:33"/>
pained as a <hi>Woman in travaile,</hi> untill he had accomplished it, Luk. 12. 5. because he <hi>loved his Church</hi> he gave himselfe for it, Ephes, 5. 26. <hi>despising</hi> the shame, and <hi>enduring the Crosse,</hi> Heb. 12. 2. that he might enjoy his Bride; that he might be for her, and shee for him, and not <hi>for another:</hi> Hos. 3. 3. This is his joy, when he is <hi>thus crowned by his Mother.</hi> It is <hi>believers</hi> that are <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and <hi>brother</hi> of this <hi>Solomon:</hi> Math: 12. 49. 50. They <hi>crowne</hi> him in the day of his <hi>espousalls,</hi> giving themselves <hi>to him,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming his <hi>glory:</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 23.</p>
               <p>Thus he sets out <hi>his whole Communion</hi> with his Church under <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>5</label> this Allusion: and that most frequently. The time of his <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> unto himselfe, is the day of his <hi>marriage,</hi> and the Church is his <hi>bride,</hi> his <hi>Wife,</hi> Revel. chap. 19. v. 7, 8. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment he makes for his Saints, is a <hi>Wedding</hi> Supper. Math. ch. 22. v. 3. The Graces of his Church, are the <hi>Ornaments of his Queene,</hi> Psal. 45. v. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. And the Fellowship he hath with his Saints, is as that which those who are <hi>mutually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved in a Conjugall Relation do hold.</hi> Cant. 1. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing these two, makes suddain and insensible <hi>Transitions</hi> from one to the other: Ephes. chap. 5. from v. 22. unto v. 32. concluding the <hi>whole</hi> with an Application unto Christ and the Church.</p>
               <p>It is now to be enquired in the next place, how it is that we <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>6</label> hold communion with the <hi>person</hi> of Christ, in respect of <hi>Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Relations</hi> and affections, and wherein this doth <hi>consist.</hi> Now herein there are some things that are <hi>common</hi> unto Christ and the <hi>Saints,</hi> and some things that are <hi>peculiar</hi> to each of them, as the Nature of this Relation doth require. The whole may be reduced unto these two heads.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>A Mutuall Resignation of themselves one to the other.</hi>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. There is a <hi>mutual Resignation</hi> or making over of their <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> one to another. This is the <hi>first</hi> Act of <hi>Communion,</hi> as to the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>7</label> personall Grace of Christ. Christ makes himselfe over to the Soule to be <hi>his,</hi> as to all the love, care, and tendernesse of an <hi>husband;</hi> and the <hi>soule</hi> gives up it selfe wholly unto the Lord Christ, to be <hi>his,</hi> as to all loving, tender obedience. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is the main of <hi>Christs</hi> &amp; the <hi>Saints Espousals.</hi> This in the <hi>Prophet</hi> is set out under a <hi>parable</hi> of himselfe and an <hi>Harlot,</hi> Hos. 3. 3.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60108:33"/>
                  <hi>Thou shalt abide for me</hi> (saith he unto her) <hi>thou shalt not be for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and I will be for thee.</hi> Poor Harlot saith the Lord Christ, I have bought thee unto my selfe with the <hi>price</hi> of mine <hi>own Blood,</hi> and now this is that which we will consent unto, I WILL BE FOR THEE, and THOU SHALT BE FOR MEE, and not for another.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Christ gives himselfe to the <hi>Soule</hi> with all his <hi>Excellencys,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">

                  </note> he addes that Patheticall wish of the Enjoyment of this his spouse: chap. 2. 14. <hi>O my dove</hi> (saith he) <hi>that art in the clefis of the Rocke, in the secret places of the staires, let me heare thy voyce, let me see thy countenance, for sweet is thy voice and thy Countenance is comely.</hi> Do not hide thy selfe as one that <hi>flies</hi> to the clefts of the Rocks, be not <hi>dejected</hi> as one that <hi>hides</hi> her selfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the <hi>staires,</hi> &amp; is afraid to come forth to the Company that enquires for her? let not thy spirit be <hi>cast down</hi> at the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of thy supplications, let me yet heare thy <hi>sighs</hi> and <hi>groanes,</hi> thy breathings and pantings to me, they are very sweet, very delightfull: and thy spirituall <hi>countenance,</hi> thy appearance in heavenly things, is <hi>comely</hi> and delightfull unto me. Neither doth he <hi>leave</hi> her thus, but chap. 4. 8. <hi>presseth</hi> her hard to a closer with him in this conjugall bond. <hi>Come with me from Lebanon (my spouse) with me from Lebanon, look from the top of Amana, from the the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the Lyons dens, and the mountaines of the Leopards.</hi> Thou art in a <hi>wandring condition,</hi> (as the <hi>Israelites</hi> of old) among <hi>Lyons</hi> and <hi>Leopards,</hi> sins and troubles? come from thence unto me, and I will give thee <hi>refreshment</hi> Math. 11. 27. upon this Invitation the spouse <hi>boldly</hi> concludes, chap. 7. 10. that the <hi>desire of Christ is towards her:</hi> that he doth indeed <hi>love</hi>

her, and ayme at taking her unto this <hi>fellowship</hi> with himselfee So in carrying on this union, Christ freely besto weth <hi>himself. upon the Soule.</hi> Precious and excellent as he is, he becometh ours. He makes <hi>himselfe</hi> to be so, and with him, all his Graces. Hence saith the spouse my <hi>Beloved is mine:</hi> in all that he is, he is mine. Because he is <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> 
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Is. 45. 24, 25</note> he is the Lord <hi>Our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:</hi> Jer. ch. 23. v. 6. Because he is the <hi>Wisedome</hi> of God, and the power of God, he is made unto us <hi>Wisedome &amp;c.</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30. Thus the <hi>Branch of the Lord is beautifull and glorious, and the fruite of the Earth is excellent, and comely to them</hi> that are escaped of Israel. Isa. 4. v. 2. This is the first thing on the part of Christ, the <hi>free donation</hi> and bestowing of himselfe upon us to be our <hi>Christ,</hi> our beloved, as to all the Ends and Purposes of Love, <hi>Mercy,</hi> Grace, and Glory, whereunto in his <hi>Mediation</hi> he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, in a marriage Covenant, never to be broken.

               <p n="2">2. On the part of the <hi>Saints?</hi> It is their <hi>free, willing consent</hi>

               <p>Now this in the soule, is either <hi>initiall,</hi> or the Solemne <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> at the first entrance of <hi>Union,</hi> or <hi>Consequentiall,</hi> in renewed Acts of Consent all our dayes.

               <p>There are two things that compleat this <hi>selfe Resignation</hi> of the soule.</p>

There was a <hi>Fullnesse</hi> of Grace in the Humane Nature of Christ: He received not the <hi>Spirit by Measure.</hi> Joh. chap. 3. v. 34. <hi>A fullnesse like that of Light,</hi> in the Sun, or of <hi>Water in the Sea;</hi> I speak not in respect of <hi>Communication,</hi> but <hi>sufficiency.</hi> A <hi>fullnesse</hi> incomparably above the <hi>measure</hi> of Angells, Yet it was not properly an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Fullnesse;</hi> it was a <hi>created,</hi> and therefore a <hi>limited</hi> fullnesse. If it could be conceived as separated from the <hi>Deity,</hi> surely so many <hi>thirsty</hi> guilty soules, as every day drink <hi>deep</hi> and large draughts of <hi>Grace</hi> and Mercy from him, would (if I may so speak)! <hi>sink</hi> him to the very bottome: nay, it could afford no <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi> at all, but only in a <hi>morall</hi> way.

If now there be <hi>Grace</hi> enough for sinners in an <hi>All-sufficient God,</hi> it is in Christ And indeed in any <hi>other</hi> there cannot be enough.

This <hi>Infinitenesse</hi> of Grace in respect of its spring and Fountaine will answer all objections that might hinder our soules from drawing nigh to <hi>Communion</hi> with him, and from a free embracing of him.

this is yet in much darknesse, being the exurgency of mens <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings</hi> from their <hi>observations;</hi> yea the mannagement of it hath been such, as that it hath proved a <hi>snare</hi> allmost <hi>universally</hi> unto them towards whom it hath been exercised: Eccles. 8. 11. as well as a Temptation to them who have looked on, Job. 21 7. Psal: 73. 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. Jerem. 12. 1. Hab. 1. 13. The <hi>discovery</hi> of it in Christ, is utterly of another nature. In him the very <hi>Nature</hi> of God is discovered to be <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>kindnesse,</hi> and that he will <hi>exercise</hi> the same to sinners, he hath <hi>promised, sworne,</hi> and solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ingaged himselfe by Covenant. And that we may not <hi>hesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi> about the <hi>ayme</hi> which he hath herein, there is a stable <hi>bottome</hi> and foundation of <hi>acting</hi> sutably to those gracious properties of his nature, held forth: <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Reconciliation</hi> and <hi>Attonement</hi> that is made in the blood of Christ. What ever discovery were made of the <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>Lenity</hi> of God unto us, yet if it were not withall revealed, that the other <hi>Properties</hi> of God, as his <hi>Justice</hi> and Revenge for sinne, had their <hi>actings</hi> also assigned to them to the full, there could be little consolation gathered from the former. And therefore though God may teach men his Goodnesse and forbearance, by <hi>sending them raine and fruitfull seasons,</hi> yet withall at the same time upon all occasions <hi>revealing his wrath from Heaven against the ungodlinesse of men,</hi> (Rom. 1. 18.) It is impossible that they should doe any thing, but miserably <hi>fluctuate</hi> and tremble at the event of these dispensations: And yet this is the <hi>best</hi> that men can have out of Christ, the utmost they can <hi>attaine</hi> unto: With the present possession of good things administred in this patience, men <hi>might</hi> and did for a season take up their thoughts, and satiate themselves; but yet they were not in the least delivered from the <note n="o" place="margin">

But now, as was said, with that Revelation of <hi>forbearance</hi> which we have in Christ, there is also a discovery of the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of his <hi>Justice</hi> and wrath against sinne, so that we need not feare any actings from them, to enterfere with the <hi>workes</hi> of his Patience, which are so sweet unto us. Hence <hi>God</hi> is said to be in <hi>Christ reconciling the world to himselfe:</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19. Manifesting himselfe in him, as

                     <hi>one</hi> that hath now no more to doe, for the manifestation of all his <hi>Attributes,</hi> that is, for the glorifying of himselfe, but only to <hi>forbeare, reconcile,</hi> and <hi>pardon sinne</hi> in him.</p>

And of the Love of Christ to his Church, and his Union with it, to carry on this businesse, <hi>this is a great Mystery,</hi> Eph. 5. 32. says the Apostle, great <hi>Wisdome</hi> lyes herein.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>then;</hi> this also is hid in Christ, the <hi>great</hi> and unspeakable <hi>Riches</hi> of the <hi>Wisdome</hi> of God, in <hi>pardoning</hi> sinne, <hi>saving</hi> sinners, satisfying <hi>Iustice,</hi> fulfilling the <hi>Law,</hi> repairing his own <hi>Honour,</hi> and providing for us a more exceeding weight of Glory: and all this out of such a <hi>condition</hi> as wherein it was impossible that it should enter into the hearts of <hi>Angells</hi> or men, how ever the

                     <hi>Glory</hi> of God should be repaired, and one <hi>sinning</hi> creature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from everlasting ruine. Hence it is said, that at the last day, <hi>God shall be glorified in his Saints, and admired in all them that believe,</hi> 2 Thess. 1. 10. it shall be an <hi>admirable</hi> thing, and God shall be for ever Glorious in it, even in the bringing of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to himselfe. To save <hi>Sinners</hi> through <hi>believing</hi> shall be found to be a farre more admirable worke, then to create the <hi>World of nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. His <hi>Allsufficiency</hi> is the last of this sort that I shall name <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Gods <hi>Allsufficiency</hi> in himselfe, is his Absolute and Universall Perfection; whereby nothing is <hi>wanting in him,</hi> nothing <hi>to</hi> him: no accession can be made to his <hi>fullnesse,</hi> no decrease or wasting can <hi>happen</hi> thereunto. There is also in him an <hi>Allsufficiency</hi> for others: Which is his power to <hi>impart</hi> and communicate his <hi>goodnesse,</hi> and Himselfe, so to them, as to <hi>satisfie</hi> and fill them in their utmost capacity, with whatever is good and desireable to them. For the first of these, his Allsufficiency for the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication</hi> of his <hi>goodnesse,</hi> that is in the outward Effect of it, God abundantly manifested in the Creation; in that he made all things <hi>good,</hi> all things <hi>perfect,</hi> that is to whom nothing was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in their own kind; he put a <hi>stampe</hi> of his own <hi>goodnesse</hi> upon them all. But now for the <hi>latter,</hi> his giving himselfe as an All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient God, to be <hi>enjoyed</hi> by the Creatures, to hold out all that is in <hi>him</hi> for the <hi>satiating</hi> and making them <hi>blessed,</hi> that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone discover'd by and in Christ. In him he is a <hi>Father,</hi> a <hi>God</hi> in Covenant, wherein he hath promised to <hi>lay out</hi> himselfe for them, in him hath he promised to give <hi>himselfe</hi> into their <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting</hi> fruition as their <hi>exceeding great reward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And so I have insisted on the second sort of <hi>Properties</hi> in God, whereof, though we have some obscure glimpse in other things, yet the cleare <hi>knowledge</hi> of them, and Acquaintance with them, is only to be had in the Lord Christ.</p>
                  <p>That which remaineth is briefely to declare, that not <hi>any</hi> of the <hi>propertys</hi> of God whatever, can be known <hi>savingly</hi> and to <hi>Consolation,</hi> but only <hi>in him,</hi> and so consequently all the <hi>Wisdome</hi> of the Knowledge of God is hid in him, alone; and from him to be obtained.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is no <hi>saving knowledge of any property of God,</hi> nor such as brings <hi>Consolation,</hi> but what alone is to be had in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, <label type="milestone">

being <hi>laid up in him,</hi> and manifested by him. Some eye the <hi>Iustice</hi> of God, and know that this is his Righteousnesse, <hi>that they which doe such things, as sinne, are worthy of Death,</hi> Rom. 1. 32. But this is to no other end but to make them cry, <hi>who amongst us shall dwell with that devouring fire?</hi> Isa. 33. 14. Others fixe upon his <hi>Patience, Goodnesse, Mercy, Forbearance,</hi> but it doth not at all lead them to Repentance; <hi>But they despise the Riches of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and after their hardnesse and impenitent hearts, treasure up unto themselves wrath against the day of wrath,</hi> Rom. 2. 3, 4. Others by the very <hi>workes of Creation and Providence</hi> come to know his <hi>Eternall power and Godhead, but they Glorify him not as God, nor are thankefull, but become vaine in their imagination and their foolish hearts are darkned,</hi> Rom. 1. 20. Whatever discovery men have of <hi>truth out of Christ,</hi> they <hi>hold it captive under unrighteousnesse,</hi> v. 18 Hence Jude tells us v. 10. <hi>that in what they know naturally, as bruit beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That we may have a <hi>saving</hi> knowledge of the Propertyes of God attended with Consolation, these <hi>three</hi> things are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

sinners. To manifest this, is the great designe of the Gospell, as <hi>Paul</hi> admirably sets it out Eph. 1. 5, 6, 7, 8. There must our soules come to an acquaintance with them, or for ever live in darknesse.</p>
                  <p>Now this is a <hi>Saving knowledge</hi> and full of Consolation; when we can see all the <hi>Propertys</hi> of God made <hi>Glorious</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in a way of doing us <hi>good.</hi> And this wisdome is hid only in Jesus Christ: hence when he desired his Father to <hi>Glorifie his name,</hi> Joh. 12. 24. to make in him his <hi>name,</hi> that is, his <hi>Nature,</hi> his <hi>Propertys,</hi> his <hi>Will,</hi> all glorious in that worke of Redemption he had in hand; he was instantly answered from Heaven, <hi>I have hoth glorified it, and will glorify it againe.</hi> He will giue it its <hi>utmost glory</hi> in him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That God will yet <hi>exercise</hi> and lay out those Properties of his to the <hi>utmost</hi> in our behalfe. Though he hath made them <label type="milestone">

And so the discovery of <hi>sinne,</hi> may also be said to be by Christ, to be part of the Wisdome that is <hi>hid</hi> in him. But yet there is a twofold regard besides this, of his sending his Spirit to convince us, wherein this <hi>wisdome</hi> appears to be hid in him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because there are some neere <hi>concernments</hi> of sinne, which are more clearly held out in the <hi>Lord Christs</hi> being made <hi>sinne for us,</hi> then any other way.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that there is no <hi>knowledge</hi> to be had of sinne, so as to give it a <hi>spirituall</hi> and saving <hi>improvement,</hi> but only in him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the First. There are <hi>Fower</hi> things in sinne, that clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>25</label> shine out in the <hi>Crosse</hi> of Christ. 1. The <hi>Desert</hi> of it. 2. Mans <hi>Impotency</hi> by reason of it. 3. The <hi>Death</hi> of it. 4. A <hi>new end</hi> put to it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>desert</hi> of sinne doth clearly shine in the Crosse of Christ, upon a twofold account. 1. Of the <hi>Person</hi> suffering for it. 2. Of the <hi>Penalty</hi> he underwent.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of the <hi>person</hi> suffering for it: This the Scripture often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very <hi>emphatically</hi> sets forth, and layes great weight upon: Joh. 3. 16. <hi>God so loved the World, as that he sent his only begotten sonne:</hi> It was his <hi>only sonne</hi> that God sent into the World to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for sinne, Rom. 8 32. he <hi>spared not his only sonne, but gave him up to death for us all.</hi> To see a <hi>Slave</hi> beaten and corrected, it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues a <hi>fault</hi> committed, but yet perhaps the demerit of it was not very great. The correction of a <hi>Sonne</hi> argues a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation; that of an <hi>only sonne,</hi> the greatest imaginable. Never was sinne seen to be more abominably <hi>sinfull</hi> and full of provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, then when the burthen of it was upon the shoulders of the <hi>son of God.</hi> God having made his <hi>sonne,</hi> the sonne of his <hi>Love,</hi> his <hi>only</hi> begotten, full of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Truth, sinne for us,</hi> to manifest <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:60108:56"/>
his indignation against it, and how utterly <hi>impossible</hi> it is, that he should let the least sinne goe unpunished, he lays hand on him, and <hi>spares</hi> him not. If <note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 10. 7. Isa. 53. 6.</note> sinne be imputed to the <hi>deare sonne</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Zach. 13. 7.</note> of his bosome, as upon his own voluntary assumption of it, it was, (for he said to his Father, <hi>Lo I come to doe thy will,</hi> and all our iniquities <hi>did meet on him,)</hi> he will not <hi>spare</hi> him any thing of the due <hi>desert</hi> of it; Is it not most cleare from hence, even from the <hi>blood</hi> of the <hi>Crosse</hi> of Christ, that such is the <hi>demerit</hi> of sinne, that it is altogether <hi>impossible</hi> that God should passe by any, the least, unpunished; if he would have done it for <hi>any,</hi> he would have done it in reference to his <hi>only Sonne;</hi> but he <hi>spared</hi> him not.</p>
                  <p>Moreover! God is not at all delighted <hi>with,</hi> nor desirous of the <hi>blood,</hi> the <hi>teares,</hi> the cryes, the unexpressible torments and sufferings of the <hi>sonne of his Love,</hi> (for he delights not in the anguish of any <hi>(he doth not <hi rend="sup">i</hi> afflict willingly, nor grieve the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men)</hi> much lesse the sonne of his bosome) only he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired <note place="margin">

If the <hi>debt</hi> of sinne might have been <hi>compounded</hi> for, at a cheaper rate, it had never been held up at the <hi>price</hi> of the blood of Christ. Here then <hi>Soule,</hi> take a view of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert of sinne;- behold it farre more evident, then in all the <hi>threatnings</hi> and <hi>curses</hi> of the Law.

                  <p>It pleased God to <note n="p" place="margin">Is. 53. 5, 6.</note> 
                     <hi>bruise</hi> him, to put him <hi>to griefe,</hi> to make <hi>his soule an offering</hi> for sinne, and to powre out his life unto death. He <note n="q" place="margin">Psal. 22. 1.</note>

                     <hi>sinne,</hi> is wrapped up in him. By our <hi>impotency</hi> I understand two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our <hi>disability</hi> to make any <hi>Attonement</hi> with God for sinne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our <hi>disability</hi> to answer his <hi>mind and will,</hi> in all or any of the <hi>Obedience,</hi> that he requireth by Reason of sinne.</p>
                  <p>For the First, that alone is <hi>discovered</hi> in Christ. Many enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have the sonnes of men made after an <hi>Attonement,</hi> many wayes have they entered into, to accomplish it. After this they enquire, Mich 6. 6, 7. will any <hi>manner of Sacrifices, though</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God, as <hi>burnt offerings</hi> and <hi>Calves of a year old;</hi> though very costly, <hi>thousands of rams,</hi> and ten thousands <hi>Rivers</hi> of oyle; though <hi>dreadfull and tremendous,</hi> offering violence to nature, as to give my <hi>Children</hi> to the fire; will any of these things make an <hi>attonement? David</hi> doth positively indeed determine this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60108:57"/>
Psal 49. 7, 8. <hi>none of them,</hi> of the best or richest of men, can by any meanes redeeme his <hi>Brother,</hi> nor give to God a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some for him, for the Redemption of their <hi>soules is precious,</hi> and it ceaseth for ever. It cannot be done, no attonement can be made. Yet men would still be <hi>doeing,</hi> still <hi>attempting;</hi> hence did they heap up <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Diatr. Just. Divin. cap.</hi> 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> some <hi>costly,</hi> some <hi>bloody</hi> and inhumane. The <hi>Jews</hi> to this day, think that God was atton'd for sinne, by the sacrifices of Bulls and Goats, and the like: and the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> acknowledge no <hi>Attonement,</hi> but what consists in mens <hi>Repentance</hi> and new obedience. In the crosse of Christ, are the mouthes of all stopped as to this thing. For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God hath there discovered that no <hi>Sacrifices for sinne,</hi> though of his own <hi>appointment,</hi> could ever make them perfect that offered them, Heb. 10. 11. Those Sacrifices could never take <hi>away sinne;</hi> those services could never make them <hi>perfect</hi> that performed them, as to the Conscience, Heb. 9. 9. as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <note place="margin">Ps. 40. 6, 7.</note> proves Chap. 10. 1. and thence the Lord rejects all <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and offerings whatever,</hi> as to any such end and purpose, v. 6, 7, 8. Christ in their stead saying, <hi>Lo I come,</hi> and by him we are justified, <hi>from all, from which we could not be justified by the Law,</hi> Act. 13 34. God I say in Christ, hath condemned all <hi>Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> as wholly insufficient in the least to make an attonement for sinne. And how great a thing it was, to instruct the Sons of man in this <hi>Wisdome,</hi> the event hath manifested.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He hath also written <hi>vanity</hi> on all other endeavours whatever that have been undertaken for that purpose, (Rom. 3. 24, 25, 26.) by setting forth his only <hi>Sonne to be a propitiation,</hi> he leaves no doubt upon the spirits of men, that in themselves they could make no attonement. For <hi>if Righteousnesse were by the Law, then were Christ dead in vaine?</hi> To what purpose should he be made a <hi>propitiation,</hi> were not we our selves weake and without <hi>strength</hi> to any such purpose? so the Apostle argues Rom. 6. 6. when we had no <hi>power,</hi> then did he by death make an Attonement, as v 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Wisdome</hi> then is also hid in Christ: men may see by other helpes perhaps farr enough to fill them with <hi>dread</hi> and Asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, as those in Isa. 33. 14. But such a <hi>sight</hi> and <hi>view</hi> of it, as may lead a soule to any comfortable settlement about it;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60108:58"/>
that only is discovered in this <hi>treasury</hi> of heaven, the Lord Jesus.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

For what the Law could not doe, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Sonne, in the likenesse of sinfull flesh, and for sinne condemned sinne in the flesh: that the righteousnesse of the Law might be fulfilled in us:</hi> The Law can bring forth no <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> no obedience, it is <hi>weake</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such purpose, by reason of the flesh, &amp; that corruption that is <hi>come</hi> on us: these two things are done in Christ, and by him. First sinne is <hi>condemned</hi> as to its guilt, and we set free from that, the Righteousnesse of the Law by his <hi>Obedience,</hi> is fulfilled in us, who could never do it our selves: and Secondly, that <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi> which is required of us, his <hi>Spirit works it in</hi> us; so that that <hi>perfection</hi> of <hi>Obedience</hi> which we have in him, is imputed to us, and the <hi>sincerity</hi> that we have in Obedience, is from his <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> bestowed on us.

3. The <hi>Death</hi> of sinne; sinne <hi>dying</hi> in us, now in some <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>29</label> measure whilst we are alive. This is a third <hi>Concernment</hi> of sinne, which it is our <hi>wisedome</hi> to be acquainted with, and it is hid only in Christ. There is a two fold <hi>dying of sinne.</hi> 1. As to the <hi>exercise</hi> of it in our <hi>mortall</hi> members. 2. As to the <hi>root, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> and power of it in <hi>our soules.</hi> The first indeed may be <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> in part, out of Christ. <hi>Christlesse men,</hi> may have sinne dying in them, as to the outward <hi>exercise of it.</hi> Mens bodys may be <hi>disabled</hi> for the service of their lusts, or the <hi>practice</hi> of them may not consist with their interest. Sinne is never <hi>more alive,</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">See Treatise of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> then when it is thus dying. But there is a <hi>dying</hi> of it as to the <hi>root,</hi> the <hi>principle</hi> of it, the dayly decaying of the <hi>strength,</hi> power and life of it, and this is to be had alone in Christ. Sinne is a thing that of it selfe, is not apt to <hi>dye,</hi> or to decay, but to get <hi>ground,</hi> and strength, and life in the <hi>subject</hi> wherein it is, to eternity: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all its actuall eruptions, yet its <hi>Originall</hi> enmity against God will still grow. In Believers it is still <hi>dying</hi> and decaying, untill it be utterly abolished. The opening of this <hi>treasury</hi> you have Rom. 6. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. &amp;c <hi>Know you not, that as many of us, as were baptized in Iesus Christ, were baptized into his death? therefore we are buried with him by baptisme into death, that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the Glory of the Father, even so we also should walke in newnesse of life; for if we have been planted together in the likenesse of his death, we shall be also in the likenesse of his Resurrection; knowing this that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sinne might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, that hence forth we should not serve sin.</hi> This is the designe of the Apostle in the beginning of that Chap. not only to <hi>manifest</hi> whence is the principle &amp; rise of our <hi>Mortification</hi> &amp; the death of sin, even from the <hi>death &amp; blood</hi> of Christ, but also the manner of sins <hi>continuance &amp; dying</hi> in us, from the manner of Christs <hi>dying</hi> for sin: he was crucifyed <hi>for us,</hi> &amp; thereby sin was crucifyed <hi>in us:</hi> he dyed for us, and the <hi>body</hi> of sin is destroyed that we should not serve sin: that as he was <hi>raised from the dead</hi> that death should not have dominion over him, so also are we raised from sinne, that it should not have dominion over us. This wisedome is hid in Christ only. <hi>Moses</hi> at his dying day had all his <hi>strength and vigour,</hi> so have sinne and the Law to all out of Jesus; at their dying day, sinne is no way decayed. Now next to the receiving of the Righteousnesse prepared for us, to know this, is the cheifest
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60108:59"/>
part of our wisdome: to be truely acquainted with the <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> of the <hi>dying</hi> of sinne, to feele <hi>vertue</hi> and power flowing from the Crosse of Christ to that purpose, to find sinne crucifyed in us, as Christ was crucifyed for us, this is wisedome indeed, that is in him alone.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is a <hi>glorious end</hi> whereunto sinne is appointed, and ordained, and discovered in Christ, that others are unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <label type="milestone">

                  <p>In the Knowledge of our selves in reference to our eternall condition, doth much of our <hi>wesedome</hi> consist. There is not any thing wherein (in this depraved condition of nature) we are more concerned, then sinne: without a knowledge of <hi>that,</hi> we know not our selves, <hi>Fooles make a mocke of sinne.</hi> A true saving knowledge of sinne is to be had only in the Lord Christ: in him may we see the <hi>desert</hi> of our iniquities, and their <hi>pollution</hi> which could not be <hi>borne,</hi> or expiated but by his blood, neither is there any wholsome view of these but in Christ, in him and his <hi>Crosse</hi> is discovered our <hi>universall impotency</hi> either of <hi>attoning Gods Justice</hi> or <hi>living</hi> up to his <hi>will;</hi> the death of sinne is <hi>procured by,</hi> and <hi>discovered in</hi> the death of Christ; as also the manifestation of the <hi>riches of Gods Grace</hi> in the pardoning thereof, a reall and experimentall acquaintance as to our selves, with all which, is our <hi>wisedome;</hi> and it is that which is of more value, then all the Wisedome of the World.</p>

2. Righteousnesse is a second thing whereof the Spirit of Christ convinces the World, and the maine thing that it is our <hi>wisedome</hi> to be acquainted withall. This all men are perswaded of; that God is a most <hi>Righteous</hi> God; (That is a naturall notion of God which <hi>Abraham</hi> insisted on Gen, 18. 35. <hi>Shall not the Iudge of all the world do right?)</hi> They <hi>know that this is the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, that they who commit such things are worthy of death,</hi> Rom. 1. 32. <hi>that it is a Righteous thing with him to recompense tribulation unto offendors,</hi> 2. Thess. 1. 6. <hi>he is a God of purer eyes then to behold iniquity</hi> Hab. 1. 13. and therefore the <hi>ungodly cannot stand in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> Psal. 1. 5. Hence the great inquiry of every one, (who lies in any measure under the power of it,) convinced of <hi>Immortality,</hi> and the Judgement to come, is, concerning the <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> wherewith to appeare in the presence of this <hi>Righteous God:</hi> This more or lesse they are <hi>solicirous</hi> about all their days; and so as the Apostle speakes Heb. 2. 15. <hi>through the feare of death they are subject to bondage all their life.</hi> They are perplexed with <hi>feares</hi> about the Issue of their <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> least it should end in <hi>death</hi> and destruction.</p>
                  <p>Unto men set upon this <hi>Inquiry,</hi> that which first and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally presents it selfe, for their <hi>direction</hi> and assistance, assuredly promising them a <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> that will abide the triall of <hi>God,</hi> provided they will follow its direction, is the <hi>Law.</hi> The Law hath many faire <hi>pleas</hi> to prevaile with a <hi>Soule</hi> to close with it for a Righteousnesse before God. It was given out from God <hi>himselfe</hi> for that end and purpose; it contains the whole obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that God requireth of any of the sonnes of men; it hath the promise of <hi>life</hi> annexed to it; <hi>doe this and live; the doers of the Law are justified;</hi> and <hi>if thou wilt enter into life keep the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> yea it is most <hi>certaine</hi> that it must be wholly <hi>fullfilled,</hi> if we ever think to stand with boldnesse before God. This being some part of the <hi>plea</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> there is no man that seeks after <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> but doth one time or another attend to it, and attempt its direction: many do it every day, who yet will not own that so they doe. This then they set themselves about; labouring to <hi>correct</hi> their lives, <hi>amend</hi> their ways, <hi>performe</hi> the dutys required, and so follow after a Righteousnesse accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>prescript</hi> of the Law. And in this course doe many men continue long with much <hi>perplexity;</hi> sometimes <hi>hopeing,</hi>

3. The matter comes at length to this <hi>Issue:</hi> they look upon themselves under this twofold <hi>qualification:</hi> as</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Sinners;</hi> obnoxious to the Law of God, and the curse thereof: so that unlesse that be <hi>satisfied,</hi> that nothing from thence shall ever be laied to their charge, it is altogether in vaine, once to seek after an <hi>appearance</hi> in the presence of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As <hi>Creatures,</hi> made to a <hi>supernaturall</hi> and Eternall End, and therefore bound to Answer the <hi>whole mind</hi> and will of God in the Obedience required at their hands Now it being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>discovered</hi> to them, that both these are beyond the <hi>compasse</hi> of their own endeavours, and the <hi>Assistance</hi> which they have formerly rested on, if their Eternall condition be of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to them, their <hi>Wisdome</hi> is, to find out a <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> that may Answer both these to the utmost.</p>
                  <p>Now both these are to be had only in the Lord Christ, who is our <hi>Righteousnesse;</hi> This Wisdome, and all the Treasures of it, are hid in him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He <hi>Expiates</hi> former iniquities, he <hi>satisfies</hi> for <hi>sinne,</hi> and procures Remission of it: Rom. 3. 24, 25. <hi>Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ: Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his bloud, to declare his Righteousnesse for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God. All we like sheep</hi> &amp;c. Isa. 53. 5, 6. <hi>In his bloud we have Redemption, the forgivenesse of sinnes,</hi> Ephes. 1. 7. <hi>God spared not him, but gave him</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 8. 32. This, even <hi>this alone</hi> is our <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,</hi> as to that first part of it which consists in the <hi>removall</hi> of the whole guilt of sinne, whereby we are come short of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God. On this Account it is, that we are assured, that none shall ever lay any thing to our <hi>charge,</hi> or <hi>condemne</hi> us: Rom. 8. 31, 34. there being <hi>no condemnation to them that are in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus:</hi> v. 1. we are purged by the Sacrifice of Christ, so as to have <hi>no more Conscience of sinne,</hi> Heb. 10. 2. that is, <hi>troubles</hi> in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence about it. This <hi>Wisdome</hi> is hid only in the Lord <hi>Jesus;</hi> in him alone is there an <hi>Attonement</hi> discovered: and give me the <hi>Wisdome</hi> which shall cut all <hi>scores</hi> concerning sinne, and let the <hi>world</hi> take what remaines.

2. There is yet something more <hi>required:</hi> it is not enough that we are not <hi>guilty.</hi> We must also be <hi>Actually Righteous:</hi> not only <hi>all sinne</hi> is to be answered for, but all <hi>Righteousnesse is to be fulfilled;</hi> by taking away the guilt of sinne, we are as persons <hi>innocent,</hi> but somthing more is required to make us to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as persons <hi>obedient.</hi> I know nothing to teach me that an <hi>innocent</hi> person shall goe to heaven, be rewarded, if he be no more but so. <hi>Adam</hi> was <hi>innocent</hi> at his first <hi>Creation,</hi> but he was to <hi>doe this,</hi> to keep the <hi>Commandements</hi> before he entred into life, he had no Title to Life by Innocency. This then moreover is required, that the <hi>whole Law be fulfilled,</hi> and all the Obedience performed that God requires at our hands. This is the Soules second inquiry, and it finds a resolution only in the Lord Christ; <hi>for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son; much more being reconciled, we shall be saved by his Life.</hi> Rom. 5. 10. his <hi>Death</hi> reconciled us, then are we saved by his <hi>life.</hi> The Actuall Obedience which he yeelded to the whole Law of God, is that Righteousnesse whereby we are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; <hi>If so be we are found in him, not having on our own Righteousnesse which is of the Law, but the Righteousnesse which is of God by Faith,</hi> Phil 3. 9. This I shall have occasion to handle more at large hereafter.</p>
                  <p>To returne then. It is not I suppose any difficult taske, to perswade men convinced of <hi>Immortality</hi> and judgement to come, that the <hi>maine</hi> of their <hi>Wisdome</hi> lyes in this, even to find out such a <hi>Righteousnes</hi> as will accompany them for ever, and abide the <hi>severe triall</hi> of God himself. Now all the <hi>Wisdome</hi> of the world is but <hi>folly,</hi> as to the discovery of this thing. The utmost that mans <hi>Wisdome</hi> can doe, is but to find out most <hi>wretched, burthensome,</hi> and <hi>vexatious</hi> wayes of perishing eternally. All the treasures of <hi>this Wisdome</hi> are <hi>hid</hi> in Christ, He <hi>of God is made unto us Wisdome, and Righteousnes,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30.</p>

All the discovery that God makes of <hi>himselfe</hi> unto us, is, that he is unexpressibly <hi>provoked,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preparing wrath against the <hi>day of wrath,</hi> and the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Righteous Judgements; the <hi>Day</hi> of his and sinners meeting, is called the <hi>day of wrath:</hi> Rom. 2. 5, 6. Neither doe we come short in our <hi>enmity</hi> against him, yea we <hi>first</hi> began it, <note place="margin">Ephes. 7. 29</note> and we continue longest in it. To expresse this Enmity, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle tells us, that our very <hi>minds,</hi> the <hi>best part</hi> of us, are <hi>Enmity against God,</hi> Rom. 8. 7, 8 and that we neither <hi>are,</hi> nor <hi>will,</hi> nor <hi>can</hi> be subject to him, our <hi>Enmity</hi> manifesting it selfe by Universall Rebellion against him, what ever we doe that seems otherwise, is but <hi>hypocrisy</hi> or <hi>flattery,</hi> yea it is a part of this <hi>Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to lessen it.

                  <p n="1">1. He takes out of the way the <hi>cause</hi> of the <hi>enmity</hi> that was between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>us; Sinne</hi> and the curse of the Law: Dan. 9. 24. He makes an <hi>end of sinne;</hi> and that by making <hi>Attonen ent</hi> for <hi>iniquity;</hi> and he blotteth out the hand writing of <hi>Ordinances,</hi> Col. 2. 24. redeeming us <hi>from the Curse by being made a Curse for us,</hi> Gal. 3. 13.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. He made <hi>Reconciliation</hi> for the sinnes of the People, Heb. 2. 17. he made by his blood an <hi>Attonement</hi> with God, to <hi>turne away</hi> that wrath which was <hi>due to us,</hi> so making <hi>peace:</hi> hereupon God is said to be in Christ, <hi>reconciling the world unto himselfe,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19. being reconciled himselfe v 18. he lays down the enmity on his part and proceeds to what remaines, to slay the <hi>enmity on our part,</hi> that we also may be reconciled: and this also</p>

So that <hi>through him we have an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse unto the Father</hi> Ephes. 2. 18. Now the whole wisdome of this Agreement, without which, there is no walking with God, is hid in Christ: out of him <hi>God on his part</hi> is a <hi>consuming fire:</hi> we are as <hi>stubble fully dry,</hi> yet setting our selves in battell array against that <hi>fire;</hi> if we are brought together we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd.

                  <p n="2">2. There is required <hi>Acquaintance</hi> also to walking together. Two may <hi>meet together</hi> in the same way, and have no quarrell <label type="milestone">

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60108:63"/>
doth not suffice that the <hi>Enmity</hi> betwixt God and us be taken away, we must also have <hi>acquaintance</hi> given us with him: Our not knowing of him is a <hi>great cause</hi> &amp; a <hi>great part</hi> of our enmity. Our understandings are <hi>darkned, and we are alienated from the life of God, &amp;c</hi> Ephes. 4. 18. This also then must be added, if we ever come to <hi>walke with God,</hi> which is our Wisdome. And this also is <hi>hid</hi> in the Lord Christ, and comes forth from him. It is true there are <hi>sundry</hi> other meanes, as his <hi>Word,</hi> and his <hi>Workes,</hi> that God hath given the Sonnes of men, to make a <hi>discovery</hi> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe unto them, and to give them some acquaintance with him, that as the Apostle speakes Act. 17. 27. <hi>They should seek the Lord, if haply they might find;</hi> but yet as that knowledge of God, <hi>which we have</hi> by his <hi>workes,</hi> is but very weak &amp; imperfect, so that which we have by the <hi>Word,</hi> the letter of it, by reason of our <hi>blindnesse,</hi> is not saving to us if we have no other helpe: for though that be light as the Sun in the firmament, yet if we have no <hi>eyes</hi> in our heads, what can it availe us? No saving acquaintance with him, that may direct us to walke with him can be obtained. This also is hid in the Lord Jesus, and comes forth from him: 1 Joh. 5. 20. <hi>He hath given us this understanding, that we should know him that is true:</hi> all other <hi>light</hi> whatever with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his giving us an understanding, will not doe it. He is the <hi>true light,</hi> which <hi>lighteth</hi> every one that is enlightened Joh. 15. Luk. 24. 45. he <hi>opens our understandings</hi> that we may understand the Scriptures; none hath known God at any time, <hi>but he hath revealed him.</hi> 1 Joh. 18. God dwells in that <hi>light which no man can approach unto,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 26. None hath ever had any such <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance</hi> with him, as to be said to have <hi>seen him,</hi> but by the <hi>Revelation</hi> of Jesus Christ. Hence he tells the Pharisees, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all their great knowledge which they pretended, indeed they had <hi>neither heard the voyce of God at any time, nor seen his shape</hi> Ioh. 5. 37. they had no manner of <hi>spirituall acquaintance with God,</hi> but he was unto them as a <hi>man whom they had never heard, nor seen.</hi> There is no acquaintance with God, as love, and full of Kindnesse, Patience, Grace and pardoning Mercy, on which knowledge of him alone we can walke with him, but only in Christ; but of this fully before. This then also is hid in him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There must moreover be a <hi>way</hi> wherein we must walke with God: God did at the beginning assigned us a <hi>path</hi> to <hi>walke</hi>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:60108:64"/>
in with him: even the path of <hi>Innocency</hi> and exact <hi>Holinesse</hi> in a Covenant of workes. This path by sinne, is so <hi>filled</hi> with <hi>thornes</hi> and <hi>briers,</hi> so stopped up by curses and wrath, that no flesh living can take one step in that path: a <hi>new way</hi> for us to walke in, must be found out, if ever we think to hold <hi>communion</hi> with God. And this also lys upon the former account. It is hid in Christ: All the world cannot, but <hi>by</hi> and <hi>in</hi> him, discover a path, that a man may walke one step with God in. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holy Ghost tells us, that Christ hath <hi>consecrated,</hi> dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and set apart for that purpose, a <hi>new and living way</hi> into the holyest of all, Heb. 10. 20. a <hi>new</hi> one, for the first <hi>old</hi> one was uselesse, a <hi>living</hi> one, for the other is <hi>dead:</hi> therefore saith he <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>let us draw neer;</hi> having a way to walke in, let us draw neere. And this way that he hath prepared is no other but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, Ioh. 14. 5. in answer to them, who would goe to the <hi>Father,</hi> and hold <hi>Communion</hi> with him, he tells them, <hi>I am the way and no man cometh to the Father, but by me.</hi> He is the <hi>medium</hi> of all Communication between God and us: In him we <hi>meet,</hi> in him we <hi>walke:</hi> all influences of <hi>Love, Kindesse, Mercy,</hi> from God to us, are through him; all our returnes of <hi>Love, Delight, Faith,</hi> Obedience unto God, are all through him. He being that <hi>one way,</hi> God so often promiseth his people: and it is a glorious way, Isa. 35. 8. an <hi>high way,</hi> a way of <hi>Holinesse,</hi> a way that none can <hi>erre</hi> in, that once enter it; which is further set out Isa. 42. 16. All other <hi>ways,</hi> all paths but this, go down to the <hi>chambers</hi> of death: they all lead to <hi>walke contrary</hi> to God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But suppose all this, that <hi>Agreement</hi> be made, <hi>Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> given, and a <hi>way</hi> provided, yet if we have no <hi>Strength</hi>

Neither can all the creatures; in Heaven &amp; Earth yeild us the least assistance.

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60108:64"/>
with God, is <hi>from</hi> him; <hi>I can doe all things through Christ that strengthneth me,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 4. 12. who denys that of our selves we have any <hi>sufficiency</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 5. We that can doe <hi>nothing</hi> in our selves, we are such weaklings, can doe <hi>all things</hi> in Jesus Christ, as <hi>Giants;</hi> and therefore in <hi>him,</hi> we are, against all oppositions in our way, <hi>more than Conquerours,</hi> Rom. 8. 37. and that because <hi>from his fullnesse, we receive Grace for Grace,</hi> Joh. 1. 16. From him have we the <hi>Spirit</hi> of life and power, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, he beares us, as on <hi>Eagles</hi> wings <hi>swiftly, safely,</hi> in the paths of walking with God. Any <hi>step</hi> that is taken in any way, by strength that is not immediately from Christ, is one step to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Hell.

Hath it not been so with the <hi>choisest of his Saints,</hi> Heb. 3. 16. Isa. 6. 5. Job. 42. 5, 6. whence then, should we take to our selves this <hi>boldnesse</hi> to walke with God? This the Apostle will informe us in Heb. 10 19. it is <hi>by the blood of Jesus;</hi> so Ephes. 3 12. <hi>in him we have boldnesse; and accesse with confidence,</hi> not standing a farre off, like the <hi>people</hi> at the giving of the <hi>Law,</hi> but <hi>drawing nigh</hi> to God with <hi>boldnesse,</hi> and that upon this account.

Now the Lord Jesus by the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and the <hi>Attonement</hi> that he hath made, hath taken away this <hi>Conscience of sinne;</hi> that is, a dread of revenge from God, upon the account of the <hi>guilt</hi> thereof. He hath removed the <hi>slaying</hi> sword of the Law, and on that account gives us <hi>great boldnesse</hi> with God; discovering him unto us now, no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger as a <hi>revenging Judge,</hi> but as a <hi>tender,</hi> mercifull, and <hi>reconciled Father,</hi> Moreover, wherereas there is on us by nature a <hi>Spirit of Bondage,</hi> filling us with innumerable tormenting feares, he takes it a way, and gives us the <hi>Spirit of Adoption,</hi> whereby we cry <hi>Abba Father,</hi> &amp; behave our selves with Confidence and gracious boldnesse as Children: for where the <hi>Spirit of God is, there is Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 17.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>41</label> intended unto a close, and manifested that all <hi>true wisdome and knowledge</hi> is laid up in, and <hi>laid out by</hi> the Lord Jesus; and this by an <hi>Induction</hi> of the chiefe <hi>particular heads</hi> of those things wherein <hi>confessedly</hi> our Wisdome doth consist: I have but one more to adde, and therein I shall be briefe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly then I say, this Truth will be further manifested by the consideration of the <hi>insufficiency</hi> and vanity of any thing else, that may lay <hi>claime,</hi> or pretend to a title to <hi>Wisdome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There be <hi>two</hi> things in the World, that doe passe under this account, The one is <hi>Learning</hi> or <hi>Literature;</hi> 1. <hi>Skill</hi> and <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>Arts, Sciences, Tongues,</hi> with the knowledge of the things that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60108:65"/>
are <hi>past.</hi> 2. <hi>Prudence</hi> and skill for the mannagement of our selves in reference to others, in <hi>civill</hi> affaires, for publique good, which is much the <hi>fairest</hi> flower, within the border of <hi>Natures</hi> garden. Now concerning both these, I shall briefly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That they are utterly <hi>insufficient</hi> for the compassing and obtaining of those <hi>particular Ends,</hi> whereunto they are designed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That both of them in <hi>conjunction,</hi> with their utmost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, cannot reach the true <hi>generall</hi> end of Wisdome; both which considerations will set the crowne in the issue up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>head</hi> of Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>Begin we with the First of these, and that as to the <hi>First</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>Learning</hi> it selfe, if it were all in one man, is not able to compasse the <hi>particular end</hi> whereto it is designed, which writes <hi>vanity</hi> and vexation upon the forehead thereof.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>particular</hi> end of <hi>Literature,</hi> (though not observed by many, mens eyes being fixed on false ends, which compells them in their progresse <hi>aberrare a scopo</hi> is none other, but to <hi>remove</hi> some part of that <hi>curse</hi> which is come upon us by sinne. Learning, is the product of the Soules strugling with the curse for sin. <hi>Adam</hi> at his first Creation, was compleatly furnished with all that <hi>knowledge</hi> (excepting only things not then in <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> neither in <hi>themselves,</hi> nor any <hi>naturall</hi> causes, as that which we now call <hi>tongues,</hi> and those things that are the Subject of <hi>story)</hi> as farr as it lyes in a needfull tendency to the utmost end of man, which we now <hi>presse</hi> after.

Generall collection of all the <hi>Wise men</hi> in the world, to make an <hi>Experiment</hi> of their skill and learning, in giving <hi>names</hi> to all living creatures suitable to their natures, and expressive of their qualitys, they would quickly perceive the losse they have incurred. <hi>Adam</hi> was made <hi>perfect,</hi> for the whole end of ruling the Creatures, and living to God for which he was made; which, without the knowledge of the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>one,</hi> and the <hi>will</hi> of the <hi>other,</hi> he could not be. All this being lost by sinne, a multiplication of <hi>tongues</hi> also being brought in as a <hi>curse</hi> for an after Rebellion, the whole design of <hi>Learning</hi> is but to <hi>disintangle</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 10. 3. &amp;c.</note> the soule from this <hi>Issue</hi> of sinne. Ignorance, darknesse and blindnesse is come upon the understanding; acquaintance with the workes of God, <hi>Spirituall</hi> and naturall, is lost; strangnesse of communication is given by <hi>multiplication</hi> of tongues. <hi>Tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating</hi> of Passions and Affections, with innumerable darkning prejudices, are also come upon us. To <hi>remove</hi> and take this <hi>away,</hi> to disintangle the minde in its reasonings, to recover an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the <hi>workes of God,</hi> to subduct the soule from under the <hi>Effects</hi> of the Curse of <hi>division</hi> of tongues, is the aime and tendance of Literature.

To this purpose, I desire to observe these two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the <hi>knowledge</hi> aymed at to be recovered, was given unto man in order to his <hi>walking</hi> with God, unto that <hi>supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi>

                     <hi>end</hi> whereunto he was appointed. For after he was <hi>furnished</hi> with all his Endowments, the <hi>Law</hi> of life and <hi>death</hi> was given to him, that he might know wherefore he received them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore knowledge in him was <hi>spiritualized,</hi> and sanctified, even that knowledge which he had by <hi>nature,</hi> in respect of its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and end, was <hi>spirituall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the <hi>losse</hi> of it, is part of that <hi>curse</hi> which was infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>on us</hi> for sinne. What ever we come short in of the state of the first man in <hi>innocency,</hi> whether in losse of good, or <hi>addition</hi> of evill, it is all of the <hi>curse</hi> for sinne. Besides! that blindnesse, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60108:66"/>
darknesse, deadnesse, which is every where ascribed to us in the state of nature, doth fully comprize that also whereof we speake.</p>
                  <p>On these two considerations it is most apparent, that <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> can no way of it selfe attaine the end it aymeth at. For <label type="milestone">

                  <p n="1">1. First is, That through the <hi>Righteous Judgement</hi> of God lopping off the top, flowers of the <hi>pride of men,</hi> it frequently comes to passe, that those who are furnished with the greatest
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60108:68"/>
                     <hi>Abilities</hi> in this kind, do lay them out to a direct contrary <hi>End,</hi> unto that which is their proper naturall tendency and ayme, From whom (for the most part) are all the <hi>commotions,</hi> in the world; the breaking up of bounds, setting the whole frame of nature on fire; is it not from such men as these? Were not men so <hi>wise,</hi> the world perhaps would be <hi>more quiet,</hi> when the end of <hi>wisedome</hi> is to keep it in quietnesse. This seems to be a <hi>curse</hi> that God hath spread upon the wisedome of the World in the most in whom it is, that it shall be employed in <hi>direct opposition</hi> to its proper end.</p>

So also Job. 5. 12, 13, 14. They meet with <hi>darkenesse</hi> in the day time: when all things seem <hi>cleare</hi> about them, and a man would wonder how men should <note place="margin">Isa. 29. 14. 47. 10. Jerem. 49. 7. Obad. 8.</note> misse their way, then will God make it darkenesse to such as these; so Psal. 33. 10. Hence God as it were sets them at worke, and undertakes their disappointment, Isa 8. 9, 10. <hi>Goe about your Councells</hi> saith the Lord, and I will take order that it shall come to nought. And Psal. 2. 3, 4; When men are deep at their <hi>plots</hi> and contrivances, God is said to have them in <hi>derision, to laugh them to scorne;</hi> seeing the poor wormes industriously working out their own ruine.

                  <p n="3">3. That this <hi>wisedome</hi> which should tend to <hi>universall quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> hath allmost constantly given <hi>universall disquietnesse</hi> unto

                     </note> of this <hi>wisdome.</hi> The great men of the world carry away the reputation of it: really it is found in few of them. They are for the most part common events, whereunto they contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute not the least mite, which are ascribed to their care, vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy and foresight. Mean men that have learned to adore what is above them, reverence the <hi>meetings</hi> and conferences of those who are in Greatnesse and esteem. Their weaknesse and folly is little known; where this <hi>wisedome</hi> hath been most eminent, it hath dwelt so close upon the borders of <hi>Atheisme,</hi> been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with such falsenesse and injustice, that it hath made its possessors: <hi>wicked</hi> and infamous.</p>
                  <p>I shall not need to give any more instances to manifest the <hi>insufficiency</hi> of this wisedome for the attainning of its own peculiar, and immediate End.

                  <p>And this is the first Reason why true wisedome cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in either of these, because they come short even of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and <hi>immediate ends</hi> they ayme at. But</p>

                  <p>To draw then unto a close; If true and <hi>solid wisedome</hi> is not in the least to be found amongst these, if the <hi>pearle</hi> be not bid in this <hi>feild,</hi> if these <hi>two</hi> are but vanity &amp; disappointment, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be to no purpose to seek for it in any thing else below,

these being amongst them <hi>incomparably</hi> the most excellent, and therefore with one accord let us set the crown of this Wisedom on the head of the Lord Jesus.</p>
                  <p>Let the <hi>Reader</hi> then in a few words take a view of the <hi>Tendency</hi> of this whole <hi>Digression.</hi> To draw our hearts to the more <hi>cheerfull</hi> entertainment of, and delight in the Lord Jesus, is the ayme thereof.

The <hi>Delight</hi> of the <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome</hi> in the day of his espousalls is the height of what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of <hi>delight</hi> can be carried unto. This is in Christ answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the <hi>Relation</hi> he takes us into. His heart <hi>is glad</hi> in us, without <hi>sorrow.</hi> And every day whilst we live is his <hi>wedding</hi> day. It is said of him. Zeph. 3. 17. <hi>The Lord thy God in the midst of thee</hi> (that is dwelling amongst us taking our nature Joh. 1. 14.) <hi>is mighty, he will save, he will rejoyce over thee with joy, he will rest in his Love, he will joy over thee with singing:</hi> which is a full descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of delight in all the parts of it; <hi>joy;</hi> and <hi>exaltation, rest</hi> and <hi>complacence. I rejoyced</hi> (said he) <hi>in the habitable parts of the earth, and my delights were with the Sons of men.</hi> Prov. 8. 31. The thoughts of Communion with the Saints, were the joy of his heart from <hi>Eternity.</hi> On the <hi>Compact</hi> and agreement that was between his <hi>Father</hi> and him, that he should divide a portion with the <hi>Strong,</hi> and save a <hi>remnant</hi> for his inheritance, his soule <hi>rejoyced</hi> in the thoughts of that pleasure and <hi>delight,</hi> which he would take in them, when he should <hi>actually</hi> take them into <hi>Communion</hi> with himselfe. Therefore in the preceding verse it is said he was by him as <gap reason="foreign">

disposeth of things for his <hi>advantage:</hi> so did Christ take us then into his care, and rejoyced in the thoughts of the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his trust. Concerning them he saith, <hi>here will I dwell,</hi> and here will I <hi>make my habitation for ever</hi> For, them hath he chosen for his <hi>Temple</hi> and his <hi>dwelling place,</hi> because he <hi>delighteth</hi> in them. This makes him take them so nigh himselfe in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. As he is God, they are his <hi>Temple.</hi> As he is a King, they are his Subjects; he is the King of Saints; as he is a head, they are his <hi>Body,</hi> he is the <hi>Head</hi> of the Church; as he is a first <hi>borne</hi> he makes them his <hi>Brethren, He is not ashamed to call them brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall choose out one particular from among many as an Instance for the proof of this thing: And that is this, Christ <label type="milestone">

And therefore have I chose this instance from amongst a <hi>thousand</hi> that might be given of this delight of Christ in his Saints.</p>
               <p>He then communicates his minde unto his Saints, and unto them <hi>only:</hi> his <hi>minde,</hi> the <hi>Councell</hi> of his <hi>love,</hi> the <hi>thoughts</hi> of his <label type="milestone">

               <p n="2">2. Having driven this to some <hi>issue,</hi> the soule applyeth it <hi>selfe</hi> to the <hi>promises</hi> of the Covenant wherein Christ is most gratiously <hi>exhibited</hi> unto it: Considers <hi>one,</hi> ponders <hi>another,</hi> to find a tast of him. It considers dilligently if it can see the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull Countenance</hi> &amp; favour of Christ in them or no: but now, if (as it often falls out,) the soule finds nothing but the <hi>carkasse,</hi> but the bare <hi>letter</hi> in the promise: if it come to it as to the <hi>grave</hi> of Christ, of which it may be sayd, (not in it self, but in respect of the seeking soule) he is <hi>risen he is not here,</hi> this <hi>amazes</hi> the soule and it knows not what to do.

               <p>This is the condition of a <hi>Soule</hi> that finds not the <hi>wonted</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of <hi>Christ</hi> in its <hi>private</hi> and more retired inquiries. <hi>Dull</hi> in prayer, wandring in <hi>Meditations, rare</hi> in thoughts of him!

               <p n="2">2. Then, the way she puts her self upon, is to <hi>goe about the City.</hi> Not to insist upon particulars, nor to <hi>strain</hi> the parts of the <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> too far, the <hi>City</hi> here intended is the <hi>City</hi> of God; the <hi>Church:</hi> and the passing through the <hi>broad</hi> and <hi>narrow streets,</hi> is the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <hi>enquiry,</hi> that the Spouse makes in all the paths and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances given unto it. This then is the next thing the <hi>Soule</hi> addresses it selfe unto, in the want of Christ; when it finds him not in any private indeavours, it makes vigorous applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of <hi>publique</hi> worship; in <hi>prayer,</hi> in <hi>preaching,</hi> in <hi>Administration</hi> of the <hi>seales</hi> doth it look after Christ.

kindnesse. The <hi>Solicitousnesse</hi> of a Believer in his <hi>inquest</hi> after Christ, when he finds not his <hi>presence,</hi> either for Grace or <hi>Consolation</hi> as in former days, is indeed inexpressible.

Thus being disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at home the Spouse proceeds.</p>
               <p>But yet see the <hi>Event</hi> of this also; she <hi>sought</hi> him but <hi>found him not.</hi> It doth sometimes so fall out; all <hi>will not</hi> doe, <hi>they shall seek him and not find him;</hi> they shall not <hi>come nigh him:</hi> let them that enjoy any thing of the <hi>presence of Christ,</hi> take heed what they doe; if they <hi>provoke</hi> him to depart, if they <hi>loose</hi> him, it may cost them many a <hi>bitter enquiry</hi> before they finde him againe.

               <p>What now follows in this estate? v. 3. <hi>The watchmen found</hi>

                  <hi>me &amp;c.</hi> That these <hi>watchmen</hi> of the <hi>City of God</hi> are the <hi>Watchmen</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> of the Church, is <hi>confessed:</hi> and it is of sad consider ration that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> doth sometimes in this Book take notice of them on no good <hi>account plainly</hi> chap. 5. 7. they turn <hi>persecutors.</hi> It was <hi>Luther</hi>'s saying, <hi>nunquam periclitatur religio nise inter reverendissimos.</hi> Here they are of a more <hi>Gentle temper</hi> and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the poore <hi>disconsolate</hi> soule, they seem to take notice of her Condition.</p>
               <p>It is the duty indeed of <hi>faithfull watchmen</hi> to take <hi>notice</hi> of poor, troubled, <hi>deserted</hi> soules: not to keep at a distance, but to be <hi>willing</hi> to assist. And a <hi>truely pressed</hi> soule on the account of Christs <hi>Absence</hi> cannot cover its love, but must be enquiring after him; <hi>saw you him whom my soul loveth?</hi> This is my Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! I have had sweet enjoyment of my blessed <hi>Jesus,</hi> he is now <hi>withdrawen</hi> from me; can you helpe me? can you guide me to my Consolation? what acquaintance have you with him? when <hi>saw</hi> you him? how did he <hi>manifest</hi> himselfe to you, &amp; wherein? All these labourings in his <hi>Absence</hi> sufficiently discover the souls delight in the <hi>presence</hi> of Christ. Goe one step farther to the <hi>discovery</hi> that it made of him once againe, and it will yet be more evident, v. 4, 5. <hi>It was but a little while that I passed from them,</hi>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:60108:77"/>

It often so falls out in our Communion with Christ; when <hi>private</hi> and <hi>publique</hi> meanes faile, and the soule hath nothing left but <hi>wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting silently</hi> &amp; walking humbly, Christ <hi>appeares,</hi> that his so doing may be evidently of Grace. Let us not at any time give over in this condition. When all <hi>ways</hi> are past, the <hi>summer</hi> and harvest are gone without reliefe, when neither bed nor watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men can assist; let us waite a little, and we shall see the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of God. Christ honours his immediate absolute actings sometimes; though ordinarily he crowns his ordinances. Christ often manifests himselfe immediately, and out of <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> to them that <hi>wayte</hi> for him in them. That he will do so to them that <hi>despise</hi> them, I know not. Though he will meet men unexpectedly in his way; yet he will not <hi>meet</hi> them at all out of it. Let us <hi>waite</hi> as he hath <hi>appointed;</hi> let him <hi>appeare</hi> as he <hi>pleaseth.</hi> How she deales with him when found; is nextly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.

The <hi>summe</hi> is, having at length come <hi>once</hi> more to an <hi>enjoyment</hi> of sweet Communion with <hi>Christ,</hi> the soule lays <hi>fast hold</hi> on him by faith, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Should I pursue all the <hi>Instances</hi> and Testimonies that are given hereunto in that one booke of the <hi>Song of Solomon,</hi> I must enter upon an exposition of the <hi>greatest part</hi> of it, which is not my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent businesse. Let the hearts of the <hi>Saints</hi> that <hi>are acquainted</hi> with these things; be allowed to make the <hi>close.</hi> What is it they long for? they rejoyce in? What is it that <hi>satisfies</hi> them to the utmost, and gives sweet complacency to their spirits in every <hi>condition?</hi> what is it whose <hi>losse</hi> they feare, whose <hi>absence</hi> they cannot

beare? is it not this their <hi>beloved,</hi> and He alone?</p>
               <p>This also they further manifest by their <hi>delight</hi> in <hi>every thing</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>16</label> that peculiarly belongs to Christ, as his, in this world. This is an Evidence of delight, when for his <hi>sake</hi> whom we <hi>delight</hi> in, we also delight in every thing that <hi>belongs</hi> to him. Christs great interest in this world, lys in his <hi>people,</hi> and his Ordinances; his <hi>houshold,</hi> and their <hi>provision:</hi> now in both these, doe the Saints exceedingly <hi>delight</hi> for his <hi>sake.</hi> Take an instance in both kinds in one man <hi>viz. David</hi> Psal. 16. 3. <hi>in the Saints and the excellent,</hi> or the noble <hi>of the Earth,</hi> is all my delight; <hi>my delight in them.</hi> Christ saies of his Church, that she is <hi>Hephzibah.</hi> Isa. 62. my <hi>delight in her:</hi> here says <hi>David</hi> of the same, <hi>Hephzibam my delight in them.</hi> As Christ delights in his Saints, so doe they in one another on his account. Here says <hi>David</hi> is all my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. Whatever contentment he tooke in any other persons, it was nothing in comparison of the delight he tooke in <hi>them.</hi> Hence mention is made, of <hi>laying down our lives for the Brethren,</hi> or any common cause wherein the interest of the Community of the Brethren does lye.</p>
               <p n="2">2 For the ordinances, consider the same person; <hi>Ps.</hi> 42. and 84. and 48. are such <hi>plentifull</hi> Testimonies throughout, as we need no farther enquiring; nor shall I goe forth to a new discourse on this particular.</p>
               <p>And this is the first <hi>mutuall consequentiall</hi> Act of <hi>Conjugall</hi> Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in this Communion between Christ and Believers.

that they might never tast of it. A man would not for tenne thousand worlds be willing to undergoe, that which Christ underwent for us in that one thing of <hi>desertion</hi> from God, were it attended with no more distresse, but what a <hi>meer Creature</hi> might possibly <hi>emerge</hi> from under. And what thoughts we should have of this, himselfe tells us, Joh. 15. 13. <hi>Greater love hath none then this, that one lay down his life for his friends.</hi> It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible there should be any greater demonstration or evidence of love then this; what can any one doe more?

               <p>For one to part with his <hi>Glory,</hi> his <hi>Riches,</hi> his <hi>Ease,</hi> his <hi>Life,</hi> his <hi>Love</hi> from God, to undergoe <hi>losse, shame, wrath, curse, death</hi> for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, is an evidence of a deare <hi>valuation,</hi> and that it was all on this account we are informed. Heb. 12. 2. Certainely Christ had a deare esteem of them, that rather than they should <hi>perish</hi> that they should not be his, and be made partakers of his <hi>Glory,</hi> he would part with all he had for their sakes, Ephes. 5. v. 25, 26.</p>
               <p>There would be no end should I goe through all the <hi>instances</hi> of Christ's valuation of <hi>Believers</hi> in all their deliverances, Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, in all conditions of <hi>sinning &amp; suffering,</hi> what he <hi>hath</hi> done, what he <hi>doth</hi> in his Intercession, what he <hi>delivers</hi> them from, what he <hi>procures</hi> for them; all telling out this one thing, they are the <hi>apple of his eye,</hi> his <hi>Jewell,</hi> his <hi>Diadem,</hi> his <hi>Crowne.</hi>

Indeed he disposeth of all Nations and their <hi>interest</hi> according as is for the good of Believers. <hi>Amos</hi> 9. 9. in all the <hi>siftings</hi> of the <hi>nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> the eye of God is upon the house of <hi>Israell,</hi> not a graine of them shall perish.

The Saints in the course of their lives, by the <hi>Company, Society, businesse</hi> they are cast upon, are liable and exposed to <hi>Temptations,</hi> great and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; some in one kind some in another. Herein is Christ ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly kind and tender to them in fortifying their hearts with abundance of Grace, as to that sinne unto <hi>temptations</hi> whereunto they are most exposed; When perhaps in other things they are very weake and are often surprized.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Christ sometimes, by some strong <hi>impulse</hi> of actuall grace <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>18</label> recovers the soule from the very <hi>borders of Sin.</hi> So it was in the case of <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 24. 4, 5, 6. He was almost <hi>gone</hi> as he speakes himselfe, his feet had well nigh <hi>slipt.</hi> The temptation was at the door of <hi>prevalency</hi> when a mighty <hi>impulse</hi> of Grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers him. To shew his Saints what they are, their own <hi>weakenesse</hi> and <hi>infirmity,</hi> he sometimes suffers them to goe to the <hi>very edge</hi> and brow of the hill, and then causeth them to here a word behind them saying this is <hi>the right way</hi> walk in it, and that with power and efficacy, and so recovers them to himselfe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By taking away the <hi>Temptation</hi> it selfe, when it grows so <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>violent</hi> that the poor soule knows not what to doe. This is called <hi>delivering the Godly out of temptation</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 9. As a man is pluckt out of the <hi>snare,</hi> and the <hi>snare</hi> left behind to hold another. This have I known to be the case of many in sundry <hi>perplexing</hi> Temptations. When they have been <hi>quite weary,</hi> have tryed all meanes of helpe and assistance, and have not been able to come to a comfortable issue, on a <hi>suddaine, unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly</hi> the Lord Christ in his <hi>tendernesse</hi> and compassion, rebukes <hi>Sathan,</hi> that they heare not one word more of him as to their temptation, Christ comes in, in the storme and saith <hi>peace,</hi> be <hi>still.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. By giving in <hi>fresh supplys of Grace, according as Temptations do grow or increase.</hi> So was it in the case of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 9. <hi>My Grace is sufficient for thee.</hi> The Temptation whatever it were, <hi>grew</hi> high; <hi>Paul</hi> was earnest for it's <hi>removall;</hi> and receives only this Answer of the <hi>sufficiency</hi> of the grace of God, for his <hi>support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:60108:84"/>
notwithstanding all the <hi>growth</hi> and <hi>increase</hi> of the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By giving them <hi>wisedome,</hi> to make a <hi>right, holy,</hi> and <hi>spirituall improvement</hi> of all temptations. <hi>James</hi> bids us count it all <hi>joy when we fall into manyfold Temptations</hi> Ja. 1. 2. which could not be done, were there not an <hi>holy &amp; Sprituall</hi> use to be made of them, which also himselfe manifests in the words following. There are manifold uses of Temptations, which experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced <hi>Christians</hi> with assistance suitable from Christ, may make of them. This is not the least that by them we are brought to know our selves. So <hi>Hezechiah</hi> was <hi>left,</hi> to be try'd to <hi>know what was in him.</hi> By temptation, some <hi>bosome,</hi> hidden corruption is oftentimes discovered that the soul knew not of before. As it was with <hi>Hazel</hi> in respect of enormous crimes; so in lesser things with the Saints. They would never have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved there had been such <hi>lusts</hi> and <hi>corruptions</hi> in them as they <note place="margin">2 King. 8. 13.</note> have discovered upon their <hi>temptations.</hi> Yea divers having been tempted to one sin, have discovered another that they thought not of. As some being tempted to <hi>pride,</hi> or <hi>worldlinesse,</hi> or <hi>loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> of conversation, have been startled by it &amp; lead to a disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of a neglect of many <hi>dutys,</hi> and much <hi>communion</hi> with God, which before they thought not of. And this is from the <hi>tender care</hi> of Jesus Christ, giving them in <hi>suitable helpe,</hi> without which no man can possibly make use of, or improve a <hi>Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And this is a <hi>suitable helpe</hi> indeed, whereby a temptation which otherwise, or to other persons might be a <hi>deadly wound,</hi> proves the lancing of a <hi>fester'd sore,</hi> and the letting out of <hi>corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> that otherwise might have endangered the life it selfe. So 1 Pet. 1. 6. <hi>If need be ye are in heavinesse through manifold temptations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>When the soul is at any time, more or lesse overcome by temptations Christ in his tendernesse relieves it with mercy and pardon.</hi> So that his shall not sink <hi>utterly</hi> under their burden 1 Joh. 2. 1, 2. By <hi>one more,</hi> or <hi>all</hi> of these ways doth the <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> manifest his <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugall tendernesse,</hi> and compassion towards his Saints, in &amp; under their <hi>Temptations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Christ is compassionate towards them in their Afflictions; <hi>in all their Afflictions he is Afflicted,</hi> Is. 63. 9. yea it <hi>seems</hi> that all <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>19</label> our afflictions (at least those of <hi>one</hi> sort, namely which consist in Persecutions) are <hi>his</hi> in the first place, <hi>ours only</hi> by participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <hi>We fill up the measure of the Afflictions of Christ.</hi> Two things evidently manifest this <hi>compassionatenesse</hi> in Christ.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>His interceding with his Father for their releife,</hi> Zech 1. 12. Christ intercedeth on our behalfe not only in <hi>respect</hi> of our <hi>sinnes,</hi> but also our <hi>sufferings;</hi> and when the worke of our <hi>Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> is accomplished, we shall have the <hi>reliefe</hi> he interceds for. <hi>The Father always heares him</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 7. 25.</note>. And we have not a <hi>deliverance</hi> from trouble, a <hi>recovering</hi> of <hi>health,</hi> ease of <hi>paine,</hi> freedome from any <hi>evill</hi> that ever laid hold upon us, but it is given us, on the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession</hi> of Jesus Christ. Believers are unacquainted with their own <hi>condition,</hi> if they looke upon their mercys as dispensed in a way of <hi>common providence.</hi> And this may indeed be a <hi>cause</hi> why we <hi>esteem</hi> them no more, are no more <hi>thankefull</hi> for them, nor <hi>fruitfull</hi> in the enjoyment of them; we see not how, by what <hi>meanes,</hi> nor on what account they are dispensed to us. The Generation of the people of God in the world are at this day <hi>alive, undevour'd,</hi> meerly on the account of the <hi>Intercession</hi> of the Lord Jesus. His Compassionatenesse hath been the <hi>fountaine</hi> of their deliverances. Hence often times he <hi>rebukes</hi> their sufferings and <hi>Afflictions,</hi> that they shall not act to the utmost upon them, when they are under them. He is with them when they passe through fire and water. Isa. 43. 2, 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In that that he doth and will, in the winding up of the <hi>matter,</hi> so <hi>sorely revenge</hi> the quarrell of their sufferings upon their enemies. He avenges his <hi>Elect</hi> that cry unto him, yea he doth it <hi>speedily.</hi> The <hi>controversy of Sion,</hi> leads on the day of his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, Isa. 34. 4. He lookes upon them sometimes in <hi>distresse</hi> and considers what is the state of the <hi>world</hi> in reference to them Zach. 1. 11. <hi>We have walked to and fro through the earth, and behold all the earth sitteth still and is at rest;</hi> Say his Messengers to him, whom he sent to consider the world and its condition, <hi>during</hi> the affliction of his people. This commonly is the condition of the world in such a season, they are at <hi>rest</hi> and <hi>quiet,</hi> their hearts are abundantly <hi>satiated;</hi> they <hi>drinke wine</hi> in bowles, and <note place="margin">Amos 6. v. 3, 4, 5, 6. Revel. 11. 10.</note> send gifts one to another. Then Christ lookes to see who will come in for their <hi>succour.</hi> Isa. 59. 16, 17, and finding none engaging himselfe for their reliefe, by the destruction of their adversaries, himselfe undertakes it. Now this <hi>vengeance</hi> he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishes two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:60108:85"/>
1. Temporally upon <hi>Persons, Kingdomes, Nations</hi> and <hi>Countrys,</hi> A type whereof you have. Is. 63. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. As he did it upon the old Roman world, Revel. 6. 16. and this also he doth two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By <hi>calling</hi> out here and there an eminent <hi>opposer,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him an example to all the world, so he dealt with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> for this cause have I raised thee up: Exod. 9. 16. So he doth to this day, he lays his hand upon eminent Adversaries; fills one with <hi>fury,</hi> another with <hi>folly,</hi> blasts a <hi>third,</hi> and makes another <hi>wither,</hi> or destroys them utterly and terribly. As a provoked lyon, he lys not down without his prey.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In generall, in the <hi>viols of his wrath</hi> which he will in these latter days poure out upon the <hi>Antichristian</hi> world, and all that partake with them in their thoughts of vengeance and persecution. He will miserably destroy them, and make such worke with them in the issue, that whosoever heares, both his eares shall <hi>tingle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 In eternall vengeance will he plead with the adversarys of his <hi>Beloved.</hi> Mat. 25. 41, 42, 43, 44. 2 Thess. 1. 6. Jud. 15. It is hence evident, that Christ abounds in pitty and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion towards his beloved. Instances might be <hi>multipyed,</hi> but these things are <hi>obvious</hi> and occurre to the thoughts of all.</p>
               <p>In answer to this, I place in the Saints, Chastity unto Christ <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>02</label> in every state and condition. That this might be the state of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the Apostle made it his endeavour</p>
               <p n="2">2 Cor. 11. 2, 3. <hi>I have espoused you to one husband, that I may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent you as a chast Virgin to Christ: And I feare least by any meanes as the Serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.</hi> And so is it said of the followers of the <hi>Lambe,</hi> on mount <hi>Sion.</hi> Revel. 14. 4. <hi>These are they that are not defiled with women for they are Virgins:</hi> what desile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was they were free from, shall be afterward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
               <p>Now there are three things wherein this <hi>Chastity</hi> consists.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The not taking any thing into their <hi>Affections</hi> and esteem for those ends and purposes for which they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> Here the <hi>Galatians</hi> failed in their conjugall <hi>Affection</hi> to Christ: they preserved not themselves <hi>Chast</hi> to him: They had received <hi>Christ</hi> for <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Justification</hi> and him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60108:86"/>
but being after a while <hi>overcome</hi> with <note n="y" place="margin">Gal. 3. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>charmes,</hi> or <hi>bewitched,</hi> they tooke into the same place with him the <hi>righteousnesse</hi> of the Law. How <hi>Paul</hi> deals with them hereupon is known; How sore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how <hi>pathetically</hi> doth he admonish them, how severely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them, how cleerly convince them of their madnesse and folly? This then is the first <hi>chast Affection</hi> Believers beare in their heart to Christ; having received him for their <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> and Salvation before God, for the <hi>fountaine,</hi> spring, and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of all their <hi>supply's,</hi> they will not now <hi>receive</hi> any other thing into his roome and in his stead. As to instance in one particular. We receive him for our <note n="2" place="margin">Cor. 1. 30.</note> Acceptance with God! all that here can stand in <hi>competition</hi> with him for our Affections, must be our own endeavours for a <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 10. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> to commend us to God. Now this must be either before we receive him, or <hi>after:</hi> for all dutys and <hi>endeavours</hi> of what sort soever for the pleasing of God before our receiving of Christ, you know what was the Apostles frame. Phil. 3. 8, 9, 10. all <hi>endeavours,</hi> all <hi>advantages,</hi> all <hi>priviledges</hi> he rejects with <hi>Indignation</hi> as losse, with <hi>Abomination</hi> as dung; and winds up all his aymes and desires in Christ alone and his Righteousnesse for those ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses. But the workes we doe after we have received Christ, are of another consideration. Indeed they are, <hi>acceptable</hi> to God; it pleaseth him that we should walke in them. But as to that end for which we receive Christ, of no other account then the former, Eph. 2. 8, 9, 10. Even the workes we do after <hi>believing,</hi> those which we are <hi>created</hi> unto in <hi>Christ</hi> Jesus, those that God hath ordained that <hi>believers</hi> should walk in them, as to Justification and acceptance with God here called Salvation, are excluded. It will one day appeare that Christ abhorrs the janglings of men, about the place of their own <hi>workes</hi> and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, in the businesse of their acceptation with God. Nor will the Saints find any peace in <hi>adulterous</hi> thoughts of that kind. The <hi>Chastity</hi> we owe unto him, requires another frame. The necessity, usefullnesse, and Excellency of Gospell obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence shall be afterward declared. It is marvellous to see, how <note place="margin">Perfice hoc precibus, pretio, ut hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ream in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te aliqua tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem &amp;c.</note> hard it is to keep some Professors to any <hi>faithfullnesse</hi> with Christ in this thing. How many <hi>disputes</hi> have been mannaged, how many distinctions invented, how many shifts and evasions studyed, to keep up <hi>something</hi> in some place or other, to some
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60108:86"/>
purpose or other, that they may <hi>dally</hi> withall. Those that love him indeed, are otherwise minded.</p>
               <p>Herein then of all things, doe the Saints endeavour to keep <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>21</label> their Affections <hi>chast</hi> and <hi>loyall</hi> to Jesus Christ. He is made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them of God <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> and they will <hi>own</hi> nothing els to that purpose: yea sometimes they know not whether they have any <hi>interest</hi> in him or no; he <hi>absents</hi> and <hi>withdrawes</hi> himselfe, they still continue <hi>solitary</hi> in a state of <hi>widdowhood,</hi> refusing to be comforted, though many things offer themselves to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, because he is not. When Christ is at any time <hi>absent</hi> from the <hi>soul,</hi> when it cannot see that it hath any interest in him, many lovers offer themselves to it, many <hi>wooe</hi> it's <hi>Affections</hi> to get it to <hi>rest</hi> on <hi>this</hi> or that thing for <hi>reliefe</hi> and succour; but though it goe <hi>mourning</hi> never so long it will have <hi>nothing</hi> but <hi>Christ</hi> to leane upon. When ever the soule is in the <hi>wildernesse,</hi> in the saddest condition, there it will <hi>stay</hi> untill Christ come for to take it up; untill it can come forth <hi>leaning upon him,</hi> Cant. 8. 5. The many instances of this that the book of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> affords us, we have in part spoken of before.</p>
               <p>This doth he who hath communion with Christ; he <hi>watcheth</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>22</label> diligently over his <hi>own heart,</hi> that nothing creep into it's <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> to give it any <hi>peace</hi> or <hi>establishment</hi> before God, but Christ only. When ever that question is to be answered, wherewith shall <hi>I come before the Lord,</hi> and appeare before the <hi>high God?</hi> he doth not gather up, <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> I will doe, or <hi>here</hi> and <hi>there</hi> I will <hi>watch</hi> and <hi>amend</hi> my ways; but instantly he crys in the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> have I <note n="b" place="margin">Isa. 45. 24. Phil. 3. 9. Hab. 2. 1, 4.</note> Righteousnesse? all my desire is to be found in him, not having on my own Righteousnesse.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In cherishing that <hi>Spirit,</hi> that <hi>Holy Comforter</hi> which Christ <hi>sends</hi> to us; to abide <hi>with us</hi> in his <hi>roome,</hi> and stead: He tells us that he sends him to that purpose Joh. 16. 7. he gives him to us, <hi>Vicariam navare operam,</hi> saith <hi>Tertullian,</hi> to abide with us for ever, for all those <hi>ends</hi> and purposes which he hath to <hi>fullfill</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and upon us; He gives <hi>him</hi> to dwell <hi>in us,</hi> to keepe <hi>us</hi> and preserve us blamelesse for himselfe; his name is <hi>in</hi> him, and <hi>with</hi> him; and it is upon his account that whatever is <hi>done</hi> to any of Christs, is done to him, because it is done to <hi>them</hi> in whom he <hi>is</hi> and <hi>dwells</hi> by his spirit. Now herein do the Saints <hi>preserve</hi> their conjugall affections entire to Christ, that they
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60108:87"/>
labour by all meanes not to <hi>grieve</hi> his Holy Spirit, which he hath sent in his <hi>stead</hi> to abide with them. This the Apostle puts them in minde of. Eph. 4. 30. <hi>Grieve not the Holy Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There be two <hi>maine</hi> ends for which Christ sends his <hi>Spirit</hi> to Believers. <label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For their Sanctification. 2. For their Consolation: to which two all the <hi>particular</hi> acts of <hi>purging, teaching, annoynting,</hi> and the rest that are ascribed to him may be referr'd. So there be two way's whereby we may <hi>grieve him.</hi> 1. In respect of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</hi> 2. In respect of <hi>Consolation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1.

So the connexion of the words in the place before mentioned <hi>manifests</hi> Eph. 4. 28, 29, 0, 31. and thence doth <hi>Paul</hi> bottome his <hi>powerfull</hi> and most effectuall perswasion unto <hi>holinesse,</hi> even from the <hi>abode</hi> and <hi>indwelling</hi> of this holy Spirit with us, 1 Cor. 3. 16, 17. indeed what can grieve a <hi>loving</hi> &amp; ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der friend more then to oppose him and slight him, when he is most <hi>intent</hi> about our good; and that a good of the greatest <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence</hi> to us? In this then Believers make it their businesse to keep their hearts <hi>loyall</hi> and their Affections <hi>chast</hi> to Jesus Christ. They labour instantly not to <hi>grieve</hi> the Holy Spirit by <hi>loose</hi> and <hi>foolish,</hi> by <hi>carelesse</hi> and <hi>negligent</hi> walking, which he hath sent to dwell and abide with them. Therefore shall no <hi>anger, wrath, malice, envy dwell</hi> in their hearts, because they are contrary to the Holy meek spirit of <hi>Christ,</hi> which he hath given to dwell with them.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>24</label> Christ <hi>gives</hi> and sends his Spirit to us, who from thence by the way of eminency is called the <hi>Comforter:</hi> to this end he <hi>seales</hi> us, <hi>anoynts</hi> us, <hi>establishes</hi> us, and gives us peace and joy: of all which
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60108:87"/>
I shall afterwards speake at large. Now there be two ways, whereby he may be grieved as to this end of his <hi>mission,</hi> and our chastity to Jesus Christ thereby violated.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By <hi>placeing</hi> our <hi>comforts</hi> &amp; joys in <hi>other things,</hi> and not being filled with <hi>joy</hi> in the holy Ghost. When we make creatures or <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>25</label> creature <hi>comforts,</hi> any thing whatever, but what we receive by the Spirit of Christ, to be <hi>our joy</hi> &amp; <hi>our delight,</hi> we are <hi>false</hi> with Christ. So was it with <hi>Demas</hi> who loved the <hi>present world.</hi> When the ways of the Spirit of God are <hi>grievous</hi> and <hi>burdensome</hi> to us, when <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 10.</note> we say when will the <hi>Sabbath</hi> be <hi>past</hi> that we may <hi>exact all our labours?</hi> when our <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>refreshment</hi> lyes in <hi>earthly things,</hi> we are unsuitable to Christ. May not his <hi>Spirit</hi> say, why doe I still <hi>abide</hi> with these <hi>poore soules?</hi> I provide them <hi>joyes unspeakeable</hi> and glorious, but they <hi>refuse</hi> them for perishing things; I <hi>provide</hi> them <hi>spirituall, eternall, abiding consolations,</hi> and it is all rejected for a thing of nought. This Christ cannot beare! wherefore Believers are exceeding <hi>carefull</hi> in this, not to place their joy and Consolation in any thing but what is administred by the Spirit. Their daily worke is to get their <hi>hearts</hi> crucifyed to the <hi>world</hi> and the things of it; and the world to their hearts, that they may not have <hi>living affections</hi> to <hi>dying</hi> things; they would faine look on the world as a <hi>crucifyed</hi> dead thing, that hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>forme</hi> nor <hi>beauty;</hi> &amp; if at any times they have been <hi>intangled</hi> with <hi>creatures</hi> and inferiour contentments, and have lost their <hi>better joys,</hi> they cry out to Christ, <hi>O</hi> restore to us the joys of thy Spirit!</p>
               <p n="2">2. He is grieved when through <hi>darkenesse,</hi> and <hi>unbeliefe</hi> we <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>26</label> will not, doe not <hi>receive</hi> those <hi>Consolations</hi> which he tenders to us, and which he is <hi>abundantly</hi> willing that we should receive; but of this I shall have occasion to speake <hi>afterward</hi> in handling our <hi>Communion</hi> with the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In his <hi>institutions</hi> or <hi>matter</hi> and manner of his worship, Christ marrying his <hi>Church</hi> to himselfe, taking it to that <hi>Relation,</hi> still <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>27</label> expresseth the <hi>maine</hi> of their <hi>chast</hi> &amp; <hi>choyce</hi> Affections to him, to lye in their keeping his <hi>Institutions</hi> &amp; his worship according to his <hi>appointment.</hi> The breach of this he calls <hi>Adultery</hi> every where, and <hi>whoredome;</hi> He is a <hi>jealous</hi> God, and he gives himselfe that title only in respect of his <hi>institutions.</hi> And the whole Apostacy of the Christian Church unto false <hi>worship</hi> is called <note n="c" place="margin">Revel. 17. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>fornication,</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:60108:88"/>
and the Church that lead the others to false <hi>worship,</hi> the <hi>Mother of Harlots.</hi> On this account those <hi>Believers</hi> who really attend to <hi>Communion</hi> with Jesus Christ, do labour to keep their hearts <hi>chast</hi> to him in his Ordinances, <hi>institutions</hi> and <hi>worship,</hi> and that two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They will <hi>receive</hi> nothing, <hi>practice</hi> nothing, <hi>owne</hi> nothing in his <hi>worship,</hi> but what is of his <hi>Appointment.</hi> They know that from the <hi>foundation</hi> of the <hi>world</hi> he never did allow, nor ever <hi>will,</hi> that in any thing the <hi>will</hi> of the creatures should be the measure of <hi>his honour,</hi> or the <hi>principle</hi> of his worship, either as to <hi>matter</hi> or manner. It was a <hi>witty</hi> and true sence that one gave of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandement; <hi>Non imago, non simulachrum prohibetur; sed, non facies tibi:</hi> it is a <hi>making to our selves,</hi> an <hi>inventing,</hi> a finding out ways of worship or <hi>meanes</hi> of honouring God, not by him appointed, that is so severely forbidden. Believers know what entertainement all <hi>will worship</hi> finds with God. <hi>Who hath required those things at your hands?</hi> and, <hi>in vaine doe you worship me, teaching for doctrines the traditions of men,</hi> is the best it meets with: I shall take leave to say what is upon my Heart, and what (the Lord <hi>assisting,)</hi> I shall willingly endeavour to make good <hi>against all the world;</hi> namely, that that <hi>principle,</hi> that the <hi>Church</hi> hath <hi>power</hi> to <hi>institute</hi> &amp; <hi>appoint</hi> any <hi>thing,</hi> or <hi>ceremony</hi> belonging to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, either as to <hi>matter</hi> or to <hi>manner</hi> beyond the <hi>orderly observance</hi> of such <hi>circumstances</hi> as necessarily <hi>attend</hi> such <hi>ordinances</hi> as Christ himself hath instituted, lyes at the bottome of all the <hi>horrible superstition</hi> and <hi>idolatry,</hi> of all the confusion, <hi>blood, persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>warres</hi> that have for so long a season spread themselves over the face of the Christian world; and that it is the <hi>designe</hi> of a great part of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> to make a discovery of this Truth. And I doubt not but that the great <hi>controversy</hi> which God hath had with this <hi>Nation</hi> for so many yeares, &amp; which he hath <hi>pursued</hi> with so much Anger and Indignation, was upon this account! that <hi>contrary to that</hi> glorious light of the <hi>Gospell</hi> which shone among us, the <hi>wills</hi> and fancys of men, under the name of <hi>order, decency,</hi> and the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Church (a <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maera</hi> that none knew what it was, nor wherein the power of it did consist, nor in whome reside) were imposed on men, in the <hi>ways</hi> and <hi>worship</hi> of God. Neither was all that pretence of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60108:88"/>
                  <hi>Glory, beauty, comlinesse,</hi> and <hi>conformity,</hi> that then was pleaded, any thing <hi>more</hi> or <hi>lesse,</hi> then what God doth so describe in the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> Ezek. 16. v. 25, and forwards. Hence was the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> in prayer derided, hence was the <hi>powerfull preaching of the Gospell</hi> despised, hence was the <hi>Sabbath decryed,</hi> hence was <hi>holinesse</hi> stigmatized and persecuted; to what end? that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> might be deposed from the sole priviledge and power of <hi>Law-making</hi> in his Chruch; that the <hi>true husband</hi> might be <hi>thrust</hi> aside, and <hi>adulterers</hi> of his Spouse Embraced! that <hi>taske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters</hi> might be appointed in and over his <hi>house,</hi> which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>gave to his Church.</hi> Ephes. 4. 12. that a ceremonious <hi>pompous,</hi> outward <hi>shew worship,</hi> drawne from <hi>Pagan, Judaicall</hi> and <hi>Antichristian</hi> observations might be introduc'd; of all which there is not <hi>one word,</hi> tittle or <hi>iota</hi> in the whole booke of God: This then they who hold <hi>Communion</hi> with Christ are carefull of; They will <hi>admit</hi> of <hi>nothing, practice nothing</hi> in the worship of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>private</hi> or <hi>publicke,</hi> but what they have his <hi>warrant</hi> for; unlesse it comes in <hi>his name,</hi> with <hi>thus saith the Lord Jesus,</hi> they will not <hi>heare</hi> an <hi>Angel</hi> from Heaven. They know the Apostles <hi>themselves</hi> were to teach the Saints only what Christ <hi>commanded</hi> them: Math. 28. 20. You know how many in this very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the days not long since passed, yea how many <hi>thousands</hi> left their <hi>native soyle,</hi> and went into a <hi>vast</hi> and <hi>Howling</hi> wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the utmost parts of the world, to keep their soules un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled and <hi>chast</hi> to their deare Lord Jesus, as to this of his worship and institutions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They readily <hi>embrace, receive,</hi> and <hi>practise</hi> every thing that <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>28</label> the <hi>Lord Christ</hi> hath appointed. They enquire diligently into his minde and will, that they may know it. They goe to him for directions, and <hi>begge</hi> of him to <hi>lead them</hi> in the way they have not <hi>known.</hi> The 119. Psalme may be a patterne for this. How doth the <hi>good holy soule</hi> breath after instruction in the ways and <hi>ordinances,</hi> the <hi>statutes</hi> and <hi>judgements</hi> of God? This I say they are <hi>tender</hi> in. What ever is of <hi>Christ,</hi> they willingly submit <hi>unto, accept</hi> of and <hi>give up</hi> themselves to the constant practice hereof. What ever comes on any other account they refuse.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Christ manifests and evidences his love to his Saints in a <hi>way of bounty,</hi> in that <hi>rich plentifull provision</hi> he makes for them. It hath pleased the Father that in him all <hi>fullnesse should dwell,</hi> Col.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60108:89"/>
1. 19. and that for this end, that of his <hi>fullnesse we might all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Grace for Grace,</hi> Joh. 1. 16. I shall not insist upon the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of that <hi>provision</hi> which Christ makes for his <hi>Saints,</hi> with all those <hi>influences</hi> of the Spirit of life and grace that dayly they receive from him, that bread that he gives them to the <hi>full,</hi> the refreshment they have from him: I shall only observe this, that the Scripture affirmes him to doe all things for them in an <hi>abundant manner,</hi> or to doe it <hi>richly</hi> in a way of bounty. Whatever he gives us, his <hi>grace</hi> to assist us, his <hi>presence</hi> to <hi>comfort</hi> us, he doth it <hi>abundantly.</hi> You have the Generall assertion of it Rom. 5. 20. <hi>Where sin abounded, Grace did abound much more.</hi> If grace <hi>abound much more</hi> in comparison of sin, it is <hi>abundant</hi> grace indeed, as will easily be granted by any that shall consider how <hi>sin</hi> hath abounded &amp; doth in every soule. Hence he is said to be <hi>able,</hi> &amp; we are bid to expect that he should do for us excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>abundantly above what we can aske or think</hi> Eph 3. 20, Is it <hi>pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning mercy</hi> we receive of him? why he doth <hi>abundantly</hi> pardon, Is. 55. 7. he will <hi>multiply</hi> or <hi>add</hi> to pardon, he will <hi>add pardon to pardon,</hi> that grace &amp; mercy shall abound above all our sins &amp; iniquities. Is it the <hi>Spirit</hi> he gives us? he <hi>sheds him</hi> upon us <hi>richly</hi> or <hi>abundantly</hi> Tit. 3. 6. not only bidding us drink of the waters of life <hi>freely,</hi> but also <hi>bestowing</hi> him in such a plentifull measure that rivers of water shall <hi>flow from them that receive him,</hi> Joh. 7. 38, 39. that they shall never <hi>thirst</hi> any more who have <hi>drank</hi> of him. Is it <hi>Grace</hi> that we receive of him? he gives that also in a way of <hi>bounty.</hi> We receive <hi>abundance of Grace</hi> Rom. 5. 17. he <hi>abounds</hi> towards us in all <hi>wisedome</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> Ephes. 1. 18. Hence is that invitation Can. 5 1. If in any thing then we are straitned, it is in <hi>our selves,</hi> Christ deals <hi>bountifully</hi> with us. Indeed the great <hi>sinne</hi> of believers is, that they make not <hi>use</hi> of Christ's <hi>Bounty</hi> as they ought to do; that we do not <hi>every</hi> day take of him <hi>mercy</hi> in <hi>Abundance.</hi> The <hi>oyle</hi> never ceaseth, till the <hi>vessels cease;</hi> supplys fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ <hi>faile</hi> not but only when our <hi>faith failes</hi> in receiving them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Then our returne to <hi>Christ</hi> is in a way of duty; unto this two things are required. <label type="milestone">

All <hi>Gospell-obedience</hi> is called, <hi>whatsoever Christ commands us,</hi> Mat. 28. 20. And saith he, Joh. 15. 14. <hi>ye are my friends if you do what</hi>

                  <hi>I command you:</hi> and it is required of us that we <hi>live to him</hi> who <hi>dyed for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 15. <hi>live to him in all holy obedience; live to him</hi> as our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>King.</hi> Not that I suppose there are peculiar <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi> and a peculiar <hi>law</hi> of Jesus Christ, in the <hi>observance</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are <hi>justifyed,</hi> as the <hi>Socinians</hi> fancy: for surely the Gospell requires of us no more, <hi>but to love the Lord our God with all ourhearts, and all our soules,</hi> which the <hi>Law</hi> also required: but that the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> having brought us into a condition of <hi>acceptance</hi> with God, wherein our <hi>obedince</hi> is well pleasing to him, &amp; we being to <hi>honour</hi> him as we <hi>honour</hi> the Father, that we have a respect &amp; peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to him in <hi>all</hi> our <hi>Obedience</hi> so Tit. 2. 14. <hi>he hath purchased us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himself:</hi> &amp; thus <hi>Believers</hi> do in their <hi>obedience,</hi> they <hi>eye</hi> Jesus <hi>Christ.</hi>

                  <p>1. <hi>Of Communion with Christ in purchased Grace: Purchased Grace considered in respect of its rise and fountaine. The first rise of it, in the Obedience of Christ: Obedience Properly ascribed to Christ: Two ways considered: what it was, and wherin it did consist. Of his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law in Generall: Of the Law of the Mediator: His habituall Righteousnesse how necessary, as also his obedience to the Law of the Mediatour. Of his actuall obedience or active Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. All Christs obedience performed as he was mediatour. His active obedience for us. This proved at large: Gal.</hi> 4. 4, 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. 3, 4, 5. <hi>One Objection removed. Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Christs active Righteousnesse closed. Of the Death of Christ, and its influence into our Acceptation with God: A price: Redemption what it is. A Sacrifice: Attonement made thereby: A punishment: satisfaction thereby. The intercession of Christ: with its influence into our Acceptation with God.</hi>

                  <hi>Grace,</hi> is evident on this single consideration; that there is almost nothing that Christ hath <hi>done,</hi> which is a spring of that <hi>Grace</hi> whereof we speake, but we are said to doe it with him. We are <hi>Crucifyed</hi> with him Gal. 2. 20. we are <hi>dead</hi> with him: 2 Tim. 2. 11. Col. 3. 3. and <hi>buried</hi> with him: Rom. 6. 4. Col. 2. 12. we are <hi>quickned together</hi> with him: Col. 2. 13. <hi>risen</hi> with him: Col. 3. 1. <hi>He hath quickned us together with Christ and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in Heavenly places,</hi> Ephes. 2. 5, 6. In the actings of Christ, there is by vertue of the <hi>compact</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him as Mediatour and the Father, such an assured foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation laid of the <hi>communication</hi> of the <hi>fruites</hi> of those actings, unto those in whose stead he performed them, that they are said, in the participation of those <hi>fruites,</hi> to have done the same things with him. The life and power of which truth, we may have occasion hereafter to inquire into.</p>
               <p>The first fountaine and spring of this <hi>Grace</hi> wherein we have <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>4</label> our Communion with Christ, is first to be considered: and that is the <hi>Obedience</hi> of his life co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning which it must be declared,</p>

               <p>To the handling of this, I shall only premise this Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: namely; that in the order of <hi>procurement,</hi> the Life of Christ, (as was <hi>necessary:)</hi> precedeth his death, and therefore we shall handle it in the first place: But in the order of Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the <hi>Benefits</hi> of his death are bestowed on us, <hi>antecedently</hi>

               <p>That <hi>Obedience</hi> is properly ascribed unto Jesus Christ, as <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>6</label> Mediatour, the Scripture is witnesse, both as to <hi>name</hi> and <hi>thing.</hi> Heb. 5. 8. <hi>Though he were a Son yet learned he obedience &amp;c.</hi> yea he was <hi>obedient</hi> in his sufferings, and it was that which gave <hi>life</hi> to his <hi>death:</hi> Phil. 2. 8. He was obedient to death; for therein, He did <hi>make his soule an offering for sinne.</hi> Isa. 53. 10. or <hi>His soule made an offering for sinne</hi> as it is interpreted v. 12. He <hi>powred out</hi> his soule to death, or his soule poured out its selfe unto death. And He not only <hi>Sanctifyed himselfe</hi> to be an offering, Joh. 17. 9. But he also <hi>offered up himselfe,</hi> Heb. 9. 14. an <hi>offering of a sweet sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to God:</hi> Ephes. 5. 2. Hence as to the <hi>whole</hi> of his worke, He is called the <hi>Father's Servant,</hi> Isa. 42. 1. and v. 19. And He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses of himselfe that he <hi>came into the world, to doe the will of God, the will of him that sent him;</hi> for which he manifests <hi>his great readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> Heb. 10. 7. all which evince his obedience. But I suppose I need not insist on the <hi>proofe</hi> of this, that Christ in the <hi>worke</hi>

                  <hi>of mediation,</hi> and as Mediatour, was obedient and did what He did, <hi>willingly</hi> and <hi>cheerfully</hi> in obedience to God.</p>
               <p>Now this obedience of Christ may be considered two ways, <label type="milestone">

               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Habituall Righteousnesse</hi> of Christ: as Mediator in his humane nature, was the <hi>absolute, compleat, exact conformity</hi> of the <hi>Soule</hi> of Christ, to the <hi>will,</hi> minde or Law of God; or his perfect <note place="margin">De Angelis loquitur, qui si cum Deo conferantur, aut si eos se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum Deus conferat, non habens ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem eorum quae in illis posuit, &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium ac do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum quae in illos con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulit, &amp; qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus eos ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ornavit &amp; illustravit, inveniat eos stolidos.

                  <hi>habitually</hi> inherent Righteousnesse. This he had <hi>necessarily</hi> from the Grace of Union, from whence it is, that, that which was borne of the <hi>Uirgin</hi> was an <hi>Holy thing,</hi> Luk. 1. 35. It was I say necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>consequentially</hi> that it should be so; though the effecting of it were by the free operations of the Spirit. Luk. 2. 52. He had an All-fullnesse of Grace on all accounts. This the Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes Heb. 7. 26. <hi>Such an high Priest became us, Holy, harmelesse, undefiled, separate from sinners.</hi> Every way separate and distant from sinne and sinners he was to be. Whence he is called the <hi>Lambe of God without spot or blemish,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 19. This habituall Holinesse of Christ was <hi>inconceivably</hi> above that of the Angells. He who <hi>chargeth</hi> his Angells with <hi>folly</hi> Job. 4. 18. who <hi>putteth no trust in his Saints,</hi> and in whose sight the <hi>Heavens</hi> (or their inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants) <hi>are not cleane,</hi> ch. 15. 15. allways <hi>embraceth</hi> him in his <hi>bosome,</hi> and is allways well pleased with him, Math. 3. 17. And the reason of this is, because every other <hi>creature</hi> though never so holy, hath the spirit of God by <hi>measure;</hi> but he was not <hi>given to Christ by measure,</hi> Joh. 3. 34. and that because it pleased him, that in him <hi>all fullnesse should dwell.</hi> Col. 1. 19. This habituall grace of Christ, though not absolutely <hi>infinite,</hi> yet in respect of any other creature, it is as the <hi>water</hi> of the <hi>Sea,</hi> to the <hi>water</hi> of a <hi>pond</hi> or <hi>poole.</hi> All other creatures are <hi>depressed</hi> from perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by this, that they subsist in a <hi>created, dependent</hi> being, and so have the <hi>fountaine</hi> of what is communicated to them, without them. But the <hi>humane nature</hi> of Christ subsists in the <hi>person</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of God, and so hath the bottome and <hi>fountaine</hi> of its ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, in the stricktest unity with it selfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Actuall</hi> Obedience of Christ, (as was said) was <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>8</label> his <hi>willing, cheerfull, obedientiall</hi> performance of every <hi>thing, duty,</hi> or <hi>command,</hi> that God by vertue of any <hi>Law,</hi> whereto we were <hi>subject</hi> and obnoxious, did require; and moreover to the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar

                  <hi>Law of the Mediatour:</hi> Hereof then are two parts,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That whatever was <hi>required</hi> of us by vertue of any <hi>Law,</hi> that he <hi>did</hi> and fullfiled. Whatever was required of us, by the <label type="milestone">

                  </gap>, all manner of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse whatever; that is every thing that <hi>God required,</hi> as is evident from the application of that generall <hi>axiome</hi> to the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme of <hi>John.</hi> I shall not need for this to goe to particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, in the duties of the <hi>Law of nature,</hi> to God and his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: of <hi>morally positive</hi> in the Sabath, and other acts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; of the <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> Law, in <hi>Circumcision,</hi> and observation of all the rites of the <hi>Judaicall</hi> Church; of the <hi>Judiciall,</hi> in paying <hi>tribute</hi> to Governours. It will suffice I presume that on the one hand He <hi>did no sinne, neither was guile found in his mouth,</hi> and on the <hi>other,</hi> that <hi>He fullfilled all Righteousnesse,</hi> and thereupon the Father was <hi>allways well pleased with him:</hi> This was that which he <hi>owned</hi> of himselfe, that <hi>He came to doe the will of God,</hi> and he did it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There was a <hi>peculiar Law of the Mediator,</hi> which respected himselfe <hi>meerely,</hi> and contained all those <hi>acts</hi> and <hi>duties</hi> of his, <note place="margin">§. 10.

Joh, 5. 30.</note> which are not for our <hi>imitation.</hi> So that obedience which He shewed in <hi>dying,</hi> was peculiarly to this Law: Joh. 10. 18. I have power to lay down my life. <hi>This commandement have I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of my Father.</hi> As Mediator, He received this peculiar <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> of his Father, that he should lay downe his life, and take it againe, and He was obedient thereunto. Hence we say, He, who is Mediator, did some things meerely as a man subject to the <hi>Law of God</hi> in generall, so He pray'd for his <hi>persecutors,</hi> those that put him to death, Luk. 23. 24. some things <hi>as</hi> Mediator; so He pray'd for his Elect only, Joh. 17. 9. There were not <hi>worse</hi> in the world <hi>really</hi> and evidently, then many of them that crucified him; yet as a <hi>man subject</hi> to the Law, he <hi>forgave them</hi> and prayed for them. When he prayed <hi>as Mediator,</hi> his Father allwaies heard him and answered him, Joh. 11. 41. and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60108:93"/>
in the other <hi>Prayers,</hi> He was accepted as one exactly perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his duty.</p>
               <p>This then is the <hi>Obedience</hi> of Christ, which was the first thing <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>11</label> proposed to be considered. The next is, that it hath an <hi>influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> into the <hi>Grace</hi> of which we speake, wherein we hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, namely our <hi>free Acceptation</hi> with God: what that influence is, must also follow in its order.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For his <hi>habituall Righteousnesse,</hi> I shall only propose it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these two considerations:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That upon this supposition, that it was <hi>needfull</hi> that we should have a <hi>Mediator</hi> that was <hi>God and Man</hi> in one person, as it could not <hi>otherwise</hi> be, it must needs be, that He must be <hi>so holy.</hi> For all though there be but one <hi>primary</hi> necessary effect of the <hi>Hypostaticall union,</hi> which is the subsistence of the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the person of the Sonne of God, yet that He that was so <hi>united</hi> to him, should be an <hi>holy thing,</hi> compleatly holy; was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary also; of which before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the <hi>Relation</hi> which this <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> of Christ hath to the <hi>Grace</hi> we receive from him, is only this, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, he was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>fit</hi> to doe all that He <hi>had</hi> to doe for us. This is the intendment of the Apostle, Heb. 7. 26. such an one <hi>became us:</hi> it was needfull He should be <hi>such an one,</hi> that he might doe what he had to doe. And the Reasons hereof are two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Had he not been compleatly furnished with <hi>habituall Grace,</hi> He could never have <hi>actually</hi> fullfilled the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which was required at his hands. It was therein that he was <hi>able</hi> to doe all that he did. So himselfe lays down the presence of the <hi>Spirit</hi> with him as the <hi>bottome</hi> and foundation of his going foth to his worke: Isa. 61, 1. <note place="margin">Praecipitur <hi>Levit.</hi> 22. 20. ne offeratur pecus in quo sit. <gap reason="foreign">

He could not have been a <hi>compleat</hi> and perfect <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> nor have answered all the <hi>'types</hi> &amp; figures of him, that were compleat and without blemish: but now Christ having this <hi>Habituall Righteousnesse,</hi> if he had never yeilded any <hi>continued</hi>

                  <hi>obedience</hi> to the Law actively, but had suffered as soon after his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> as <hi>Adam</hi> sinned after his <hi>Creation,</hi> He had been a <hi>fit Sacrifice</hi> and Offering, and therefore doubtlesse his <hi>following Obedience,</hi> hath another use besides to fit him for an <hi>Oblation,</hi> for which he was most fit without it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For Christs obedience to the <hi>Law of Mediation,</hi> wherein it is not <hi>coincident</hi> with his <hi>passive obedience</hi> as they speake (for I <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>12</label> know that expression is improper) it was that which was <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite</hi> for the <hi>discharging</hi> of his Office, and is not <hi>imputed</hi> unto us, as though we had done it, though the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> and fruits of it are; but is of the nature of his <hi>Intercession;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by He <hi>provides</hi> the good things we stand in need of, at least sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviently to his <hi>Oblation</hi> and Intercession: of which more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>
               <p n="3">3. About his <hi>Actuall fulfilling of the Law,</hi> or doing all things that of us are required, there is some doubt and question: and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>13</label> about it there are <hi>three</hi> severall opinions.</p>

That this <hi>Active Obedience</hi> of Christ, hath no farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence into our <hi>Justification</hi> and Acceptation with God, but as it was <hi>preparatory</hi> to his blood shedding and oblation, which is the sole cause of our <hi>Justification,</hi> the whole Righteousnesse which is <hi>imputed</hi> to us, arising from thence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it may be considered <hi>two</hi> waies, 1. As it is <hi>purely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,</hi> &amp; so it hath no other state, but that before mentioned. 2. As it was accomplished with suffering, and joyn'd with it, as it was part of his humiliation, so it is <hi>imputed</hi> to us, or is part of that, upon the account whereof, we are justified.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this <hi>obedience</hi> of Christ being <hi>done</hi> for us, is recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned graciously of God, <hi>unto</hi> us, and upon the account thereof, are we accepted as <hi>Righteous</hi> before him.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Obedience that Christ yeelded to the Law in <label type="milestone">

what ever He <hi>did</hi> or <hi>suffered</hi> in this world.

               <p n="2">2. That what ever <hi>Christ did as Mediator,</hi> He did it for them <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>whose Mediator</hi> He was, or in whose stead, and for whose good, He executed the <hi>Office</hi> of a Mediator before God: This the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost witnesseth, Rom. 8. 3. <hi>What the Law could not doe, in that it was weake through the flesh, God sending his own Son, in the likenesse of sinfull flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Law might be fulfilled in us.</hi> because that we <hi>could</hi> not in that condition of weaknesse, whereinto we are cast by sinne, come to God and be freed from <hi>condemnation</hi> by the Law; God sent Christ, as a <hi>Mediator</hi> to doc and suffer whatever the <hi>Law</hi> required at our hands, for that end and purpose, that we might not be <hi>condemned</hi> but accepted of God. It was all to this end, that the <hi>Righteousnesse of the Law</hi> might be fulfilled in us: that is, which the Law <hi>required</hi> of us, consisting in duties of obedience, this Christ performed for us. This expression of the Apostle, <hi>God sending his own Sonne, in the likenesse of sinfull flesh, and for sinne condemning sinne in the flesh:</hi> if you will adde to it, that of Gal: 4. 4. that he was so sent forth, as that he was <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="3">3. That the end of this <hi>Active Obedience</hi> of Christ, cannot be assigned to be, that He might be <hi>fitted</hi> for his <hi>death</hi> and <hi>Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. That, had not the <hi>Obedience</hi> of Christ been for us, (in <label type="milestone">

And yet to this Law also was his subjection <hi>voluntary;</hi> &amp; that not only consequentially, because he was borne upon his own <hi>choyse,</hi> not by any naturall course, but also because as <hi>Mediator</hi> God and Man, he was not by the <hi>institution</hi> of that Law obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged unto it, being as it were exempted, and lifted above that Law by the <hi>Hypostaticall</hi> Union: yet when I say his subjection hereunto was <hi>voluntary,</hi> I do not intend that it was meerely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary and at choyse, whither he would yeeld <hi>obedience</hi> unto it or no; but on supposition of his undertaking to be a <hi>Mediator,</hi>

But now moreover <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> yeelded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience to <hi>all those</hi> Lawes, which came upon us by the <hi>occasion</hi> of sinne; as the <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> Law: yea those very <hi>instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> that signified the washing away of sinne, and Repentance from sinne, as the <hi>Baptisme of John,</hi> which He had no need of himselfe. This therefore must needs be for us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That the <hi>Obedience</hi> of Christ cannot be reckoned amongst <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>18</label> his <hi>sufferings,</hi> but is clearly <hi>distinct</hi> from it: as to all <hi>formalityes, Doing</hi> is one thing, <hi>suffering</hi> another; they are in diverse <hi>predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and cannot be coincident.</p>
               <p>See then briefely what we have <hi>obtained</hi> by those considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and then I shall <hi>intimate</hi> what is the <hi>streame</hi> issuing from this first <hi>spring</hi> or Fountaine of purchased <hi>Grace,</hi> with what <hi>influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> it hath thereinto.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the Obedience of the Life of Christ, you see what is intended: his willing submission <hi>unto,</hi> and perfect <hi>compleat ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling</hi>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:60108:95"/>
of every Law of <hi>God,</hi> that any of the <hi>Saints</hi> of God were obliged unto. It is true, every <hi>Act</hi> almost of Christs obedience, from the <hi>blood</hi> of his <hi>Circumcision,</hi> to the <hi>blood of his Crosse,</hi> was <hi>attended</hi> with suffering; so that his whole <hi>life</hi> might in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard be called a <hi>death:</hi> But yet looking upon his <hi>willingnesse</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">In vita passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam hahuit actionem; in morte passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam sustinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it; dum sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutem opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in medio terrae: <hi>Bern-Ser.</hi> 4.</note> and <hi>obedience</hi> in it, it is distinguished from his <hi>sufferings</hi> peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so called, and termed his <hi>Active Righteousnesse.</hi> This is then I say, as was shewed, that compleat <hi>obsolutely</hi> perfect Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole <hi>Law</hi> of God by Christ, our Mediator; whereby He not only did no <hi>sinne,</hi> neither was there guile found in his mouth, but also most <hi>perfectly</hi> fulfilled all Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, as He affirmed it became him to doe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this obedience was performed by Christ, not for himselfe, but for us: and in our stead: it is true! It must needs be, that whilest he had his <hi>conversation</hi> in the flesh, He must be most <hi>perfectly</hi> and absolutely holy. But yet the <hi>prime intendment</hi> of his <hi>accomplishing</hi> of holinesse, which consists in the compleat obedience of his <hi>whole life</hi> to <hi>any</hi> Law of God, that was no lesse for us, then his <hi>suffering</hi> death: That this is so, the Apostle tells us, Gal. 4. 4, 5. God sent forth his Sonne made of a Woman, made <hi>under the Law,</hi> to redeeme them that were <hi>under the Law:</hi> this Scripture formerly named, must be a little farther insisted on. He was both <hi>made of a Woman,</hi> and made <hi>under the Law,</hi> that is, obedient to it for us. The end here both of the <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> and Obedience of Christ to the Law, (for that must needs be understood here by the phrase <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, disposed of in such a condition, as that he must yeeld subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and obedience to the Law) was all to redeeme us. In those two expressions <hi>made of a Woman,</hi> made under the Law, the Apostle doth not knit his Incarnation and death together, with an exclusion of the obedience of his <hi>life.</hi> And he was so made <hi>under the Law,</hi> as those were <hi>under the Law</hi> whom he was to redeeme. Now we were <hi>under the Law,</hi> not only as obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to its <hi>penalties,</hi> but as bound to all the <hi>duties</hi> of it. That this is our being <hi>under the Law,</hi> the Apostle informes us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 21. Tell me, yee that <hi>desire to be under the Law.</hi> It was not the <hi>penalty</hi> of the Law they desired to be under; but to be under it, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of obedience. Take away then the end and you destroy the meanes: if Christ were not <hi>incarnate,</hi> nor made <hi>under the</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:60108:95"/>
                  <hi>Law</hi> for himselfe, He did not yeeld <hi>obedience</hi> for himselfe: it was all for us, for <hi>our good:</hi> let us now look forward and see what influence this hath into our acceptation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Then I say, this perfect <hi>compleat Obedience</hi> of Christ to the Law is <hi>reckoned</hi> unto us. As there is a <hi>truth</hi> in that, <hi>the day thou</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>eatest thou shalt dye;</hi> death is the reward of sinne, and so we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>freed</hi> from death, but by the <hi>death of Christ:</hi> Heb. 2. 13, 14. So also is that no lesse true, <hi>do this and live,</hi> that <hi>life is not to be obtained,</hi> unlesse <hi>all be done,</hi> that the Law requires. That is still true, <hi>if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandements,</hi> Math. 19. 17. they must then be <hi>kept</hi> by us, or our surety. Neither is it of any <hi>value</hi> which by some is <hi>objected,</hi> that if Christ yeelded <hi>perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> to the Law for us, then are we <hi>no more</hi> bound to yeeld o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: for by his <hi>undergoing</hi> death the <hi>penalty of the Law,</hi> we are freed from it. I Answer; How did Christ <hi>undergoe death,</hi> meerely as it was <hi>penall:</hi> how then are we delivered from <hi>death,</hi> meerely as it is <hi>penall:</hi> yet we must <hi>dye</hi> still, yea as the last <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict</hi> with the effects of sinne, as a passage to our Father we must dye. Well then, Christ yeelded <hi>perfect obedience</hi> to the Law, but how did he doe it? purely as it stood in that <hi>conditionall,</hi> do this and live: He did it in the <hi>strength of the Grace</hi> he had received: He did it as a <hi>meanes of life,</hi> to procure <hi>life</hi> by it, as the tenour of a covenant. Are we then freed from this <hi>obedience?</hi> yes, but how farre? from doing it <hi>in our own strength,</hi> from <hi>doing it for this end,</hi> that we may obtaine <hi>life everlasting.</hi> It is vaine that some say confidently, that <hi>we must yet work for life,</hi> It is all one, as to say, <hi>we are yet under the old covenant, hoc fac &amp; vives:</hi> we are not <hi>freed from obedience,</hi> as a way of walking with God, but we are, as a way of <hi>working</hi> to come to him, of which at large afterwards.</p>
               <p>Rom. 5. 18, 19. <hi>By the Righteousnesse of one, the free gift came upon all men unto Justification of Life, By the Obedience of one many</hi>

                  <hi>shall be made Righteous,</hi> saith the Holy Ghost. By his <hi>Obedience to the Law,</hi> are we made Righteous, it is reckoned to us for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse. That the <hi>passive Obedience</hi> of Christ is here only inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is false.</p>
               <p>First it is opposed to the <hi>disobedience of Adam</hi> which was <hi>active.</hi> The <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60108:96"/>
the <hi>fault.</hi> The fault was an active transgression of the Law; and the Obedience opposed to it must be an active accomplishment of it. Besides obedience placed singly in its own nature denotes an <hi>Action,</hi> or Actions conformable to the Law; and therein came Christ, not to destroy but to fullfill the Law; <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 17. that was the designe of his coming; and so for us; he came to <hi>fullfill</hi> the Law for us, Isa. 9. 6. and borne to us; Luk. 2. 11. This also was in that will of the Father, which out of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Love he came to accomplish. 2. It cannot cleerly be evinced that there is any such thing in propriety of speech, as <hi>passive Obedience: obeying is doing;</hi> to which passion or suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cannot belong: I know it is commonly called so, when men <hi>obey</hi> untill they suffer; but properly it is not so.</p>
               <p>So also Phil. 3. 9. <hi>And be found in him not having my own</hi>

                  <hi>Righteousnesse which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the Righteousnesse which is of God by faith.</hi> The Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse we receive is opposed to our own obedience to the Law: opposed to it, not as something in <hi>another kind,</hi> but as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the <hi>same kind,</hi> excluding that from such an end which the other obtaines. Now this is the obedience of Christ to the Law. Himselfe thereby being <hi>made to us Righteousnesse:</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30.</p>
               <p>Rom. 5. 10. the issue of the death of Christ is placed upon <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> that is a slaying of the <hi>Enmity</hi> and restoring us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that <hi>Condition</hi> of Peace and Friendship wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was before his fall. But is there no more to be done? notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that there was <hi>no wrath</hi> due to <hi>Adam,</hi> yet he was to <hi>obey</hi> if he would <hi>enjoy eternall life.</hi> Something there is moreover to be done in respect of us, if after the <hi>slaying</hi> of the enmity and Reconciliation made we shall enjoy life; <hi>being reconciled by his death:</hi> we are saved by that <hi>perfect Obedience</hi> which in his life he yeilded to the Law of God. There is distinct mention made of <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> through a <hi>non-imputation</hi> of sinne: as Psal 321. Luk. 1. 77. Rom. 3. 25. 2 Cor. 5. 19. and <hi>Justification</hi> through an imputation of Righteousnesse: Jerem, 23. 6. Rom. 4. 5. 1 Cor. 1. 30. although these things are so farre from being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, that they are <hi>reciprocally</hi> affirmed of one another; which as it doth not evince an <hi>Identity,</hi> so it doth an eminent <hi>Conjunction:</hi> and this last we have by the life of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:60108:96"/>
This is fully <hi>expressed</hi> in that <hi>Typicall</hi> Representation of our <hi>Justification</hi> before the Lord, Zech. 3. 3, 4, 5. two things are <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>23</label> there expressed, to belong to our free Acceptation before God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>taking away of the guilt of our sinne,</hi> our filthy robes: this is done by the <hi>death</hi> of Christ. Remission of sinne is the proper <hi>fruite thereof;</hi> but there is more also required, even a <hi>collation</hi> of Righteousnesse, and thereby a right to life eternall: this is here called <hi>fine change</hi> of raiment: so the Holy Ghost expresses it againe, Isa. 61. 10. where he calls it plainely the <hi>garment of Salvation,</hi> and the <hi>robe of Righteousnesse:</hi> now this is only made ours by the <hi>obedience</hi> of Christ, as the other by his death.</p>
               <p>Obj. But if this be so, then are we as <hi>Righteous</hi> as Christ <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,</hi> being Righteous with his Righteousnesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> But first here is a great difference if it were no more then that this <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> was <hi>inherent</hi> in Christ, &amp; properly his owne, it is only <hi>reckoned</hi> or imputed to us: or freely bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on us: and we are made <hi>Righteous</hi> with that which is not ours. But secondly the <hi>truth is,</hi> that Christ was not <hi>Righteous</hi> with that Righteousnesse for <hi>himselfe,</hi> but for us: So that here can be no <hi>comparison;</hi> only this we may say, we are Righteous with his Righteousnesse which he <hi>wrought</hi> for us, and that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleately.</p>
               <p>And this now is the rise of the purchased Grace whereof we speake, the obedience of Christ. And this is the influence of it into our <hi>Acceptation</hi> with God. Whereas the <hi>guilt of sinne,</hi> and our obnoxiousnesse to <hi>punnishment</hi> on that account, is removed and taken away, as shall farther be declared, by the Death of Christ; &amp; whereas besides the <hi>taking away of sin,</hi> we have need of a <hi>compleat righteousnesse</hi> upon the account whereof we may be <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted</hi> with God, this obedience of Christ, through the free Grace of God is imputed unto us for that end and purpose.</p>
               <p>This is all I shall for the present insist on to this purpose; that the <hi>passive Righteousnesse</hi> of Christ only, is imputed to us, in the non-imputation of sinne, and that on the Condition of our <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>new obedience,</hi> so exalting them into the roome of the Righteousnesse of Christ, is a thing which in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Lord Jesus, I have as yet no acquaintance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: what may be said in the way of Argument on the one side or other, must be elsewhere considered.</p>

The second spring of our Communion with Christ in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased Grace, is his death and <hi>Oblation.</hi> He <hi>lived</hi> for us; he <hi>dyed</hi> for us. He was ours in all he did, in all he suffered. <note place="margin">

               <p>Now the Death of Christ as it is a spring of that <hi>purchased Grace</hi> wherein we have Communion with him, is in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proposed under a threefold Consideration.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Of a <hi>Price.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Of a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>In the first regard its proper effect is <hi>Redemption,</hi> in the second <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>26</label> 
                  <hi>Reconciliation</hi> or <hi>Attonement,</hi> in the third <hi>Satisfaction;</hi> which are the great ingredients of that <hi>Purchased Grace</hi> whereby in the first place we have Communion with Christ. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>27</label>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a <hi>Price: we are bought with a price,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 20. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nil quidom emitur nisi interveniente pretio; sed hoc tamen addit u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> magnam em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phasin habet.</hi> Bez.</note> 
                  <hi>being not redeemed with Silver and Gold, and corruptible things but with the pretious bloud of Christ,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 17, 18. which therein answers those things in other contracts: <hi>He came to lay down his life a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some for many.</hi> Math. 20. 28. <hi>A price of Redemption:</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 6. The proper use and <hi>energie</hi> of this expression in the Scripture, I have elsewhere declared.</p>
               <p>Now the proper effect and issue of the <hi>death of Christ</hi> as a <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>28</label> price or Ransome, is as I said, <hi>Redemption.</hi> Now Redemption is the <hi>deliverance</hi> of any one from <hi>bondage,</hi> or captivity, and the miseries attending that condition, by the <hi>intervention</hi> or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of a price or Ransome pay'd by the Redeemer to him by whose <hi>Authority</hi> the Captive was detained.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In Generall it is a deliverance: Hence Christ is called the <hi>deliverer,</hi> Rom. 11. 26. giving himselfe to <hi>deliver us;</hi> Gal, 1. 4. He is Jesus who <hi>delivers us from the wrath to come,</hi> 1 Thess. 1. 10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is the delivery of one from <hi>bondage or captivity;</hi> we are without him, all prisoners and captives: <hi>bound in prison</hi> Isa. 61. 1. <hi>sitting in darkenesse, in the prison house</hi> Isa. 42. 7. Chap.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60108:97"/>
49. 9. <hi>Prisoners in the pit wherein there is no water</hi> Zech. 9. 11. <hi>the captives of the Mighty and the prey of the terrible</hi> Isa. 49. 25. under a Captivity that must be <hi>lead captive:</hi> Psal. 68. 18. this puts us in <hi>bondage,</hi> Heb. 2. 14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The person committing thus to <hi>prison</hi> and into <hi>bondage,</hi> is <hi>God</hi> himselfe. To him we <hi>owe our debts</hi> Math. 6. 12. chap. 18. 27. 28, 29. <hi>against him are our offences</hi> Psal. 51. 5. He is the Judge and <hi>Law-giver</hi> James 4. 12. to sinne is to <hi>rebell</hi> against him. He shuts up men under disobedience. Rom. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 32. And he shall cast both <hi>body and soul of the impenitent into Hell fire:</hi> Math. 10. 28. To his wrath are men obnoxious, Joh. 3. 36. and lye under it by the sentence of the Law, which is their prison.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>miseryes</hi> that attend this condition are innumerable, Bondage to <hi>Sathan, Sin,</hi> and the world, comprizes the summe of them, from all which we are delivered by the death of Christ as a <hi>Price</hi> or <hi>Ransome. God hath delivered us from the power of darknesse,</hi> and hath translated us into the <hi>Kingdome of his deare Son, in whom we have Redemption through his blood:</hi> Col. 1. 13. 14. And he <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deems us from all iniquity</hi> Tit. 2. 14. from our <hi>vaine Conversation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 18, <hi rend="sup">F</hi> 19. even from the guilt &amp; power of our sin, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasing us to himselfe a peculiar people <hi>zealous of Good workes:</hi> Tit. 2. 14. so dying for the <hi>Redemption of transgressours</hi> Heb. 9. 15. Redeeming us also from the world, Gal 4. 5.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And all this is by the <hi>payment of the price mentioned into the hand of God,</hi> by whose supreame Authority, we were detained captives under the sentence of the Law. The <hi>debt</hi> is due to the great <hi>housholder,</hi> Math. 18. 23, 24. And the penalty, his curse, and wrath from which by it we are delivered, Rev. 2. 5.</p>
               <p>This the Holy Ghost frequently insists on, Rom. 3. 24, 25. <hi>Being justified freely by his grace, through the Redemption that is in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ. whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousnesse for the remission of sinnes:</hi> so also 1 Cor. 6. 20. 1 Pet. 1. 18. Math. 20. 28. 1 Tim. 2. 6. Ephes. 1. 7. Col. 1. 13. Gal 3. 13. And this is the first consideration of the death of Christ, as it hath an influence into the procurement of that Grace wherein we hold communion with him.</p>
               <p>Secondly it was a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> also. He had a <hi>body prepared</hi> him, Heb. 10. 5. wherein he was to accomplish what by the typicall <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>29</label> oblations and burnt offerings of the Law was prefigured. And
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60108:98"/>
that <hi>body</hi> he offered, Heb. 10. 10. that is his whole <hi>humane nature,</hi> for <hi>his Soule also was made an offering for sinne,</hi> Isa. 53. 10. on which account he is said to offer himselfe, Ephes. 5. 2. Heb. 1. 3. Heb. 9. 24. He gave him selfe a <hi>sacrifice</hi> to God of a <hi>sweet smelling sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Observatum est a Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantibus, ut si hostia quae ad aras duce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur, fuisset vehementer reluctata, ostendisset<expan>

The Law of this obedience being <hi>written in his heart:</hi> Psal. 40. v. 9. that is, he had a readinesse, willingnesse, desire for its performance.</p>
               <p>Now the end of <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> such as his was, <hi>bloody and for sinne,</hi> Rom. 4. 3. Heb. 2. 17. was <hi>Attonement</hi> and Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. This is every where ascribed to them, that they were to make <hi>attonement,</hi> that is in a way suitable to their nature. And this is the tendency of the <hi>death</hi> of Christ, as a Sacrifice, <hi>Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Reconciliation</hi> with God. Sin had broken <hi>friendship</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us, Isa. 63. 10. whence his <hi>wrath</hi> was on us, Ioh. 3. 36. and we are by <hi>nature</hi> obnoxious to it: Ephes. 2. 3. This is taken away by the death of Christ, as it was a sacrifice: Dan. 9. 24. <hi>when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Sonne</hi> Rom. 5. 10. And thereby doe we <hi>receive the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement:</hi> v. 11. For God was in Christ <hi>reconciling the world to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, not imputing to them their sinnes, and their iniquities</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19, 20, 21. So also Eph. 2. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. and in sundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places: And this is the second <hi>consideration</hi> of the death of Christ, which I do but name, having at large insisted on these things elsewhere.</p>
               <p>Thirdly it was also a <hi>punishment.</hi> A punishment in <hi>our stead.</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>30</label> 
                  <hi>He was wounded for our sinnes, and bruised for our iniquities, the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement of our Peace was on him,</hi> Isa. 53. v. 5. God made all our iniquities (that is the punishment of them) <hi>to meet upon him</hi> v. 6. <hi>he bare the sinnes of many.</hi> v. 12. <hi>His own selfe bare our sins in his body on the Tree,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 24, 25. And therein he <hi>who knew no sinne, was made sinne for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21. what it is in the Scripture to <hi>beare sinne,</hi> see Deut. 19. 5. 20, 17, Numb. 14. 33. Ephes. 18. 20.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60108:98"/>
The nature, kind, matter, and manner of this <hi>punishment</hi> I have, as I said before elsewhere <hi>discussed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now bearing of <hi>Punishment</hi> tends directly to the giving <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> to him who was offended, and on that account inflicted the <hi>punishment.</hi> Justice can desire no more then a proportion all <hi>punishment</hi> due to the offence. And this on his own voluntary <hi>taking</hi> of our persons, <hi>undertaking</hi> to be our Mediatour, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on our deare Lord Jesus. His substituting himselfe in our <hi>Roome,</hi> being allowed of by the Righteous judge, satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to him doth thence properly ensue.</p>
               <p>And this is the threefold consideration of the death of Christ, as it is a <hi>principall spring</hi> and fountain of that <hi>Grace</hi> wherein we have communion with him: for, as will appeare in our processe, the single and most eminent part of <hi>purchased grace,</hi> is nothing but the naturall exurgency of the threefold effects of the death of Christ, intimated to flow from it, on the account of the threefold consideration insisted on. This then is the Second <hi>rise</hi> of <hi>purchased Grace,</hi> which we are to <hi>eye,</hi> if we will hold <hi>communion</hi> with Christ in it, his death and bloodshed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, under this threefold notion, of a price, an offering, and punishment.</p>
               <p>But Thirdly this is not <hi>all;</hi> the Lord Christ goes <hi>farther</hi> yet: <hi>He</hi> doth not leave us so: but followes on the work to the <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most:</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>31</label> 
                  <hi>He dyed for our sinnes, and rose again for our justification;</hi> He <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 35.</note> rose again to carry on the compleat work of <hi>purchased Grace;</hi> that is, by his <hi>Intercession;</hi> which is the <hi>Third</hi> rise of it. In respect of this he is said to be <hi>able to save to the uttermost them that come to God by him, seeing he liveth ever to make intercession for them,</hi> Heb. 7. 27.</p>
               <p>Now the Intercession of Christ, in respect of its influence into <hi>purchased Grace,</hi> is considered two waies: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>32</label>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. As a <hi>continuance</hi> and carrying on of his <hi>Oblation,</hi> for the making <hi>out</hi> of all the fruits and effects thereof unto us. This is called his <hi>oppearing in the presence of God for us,</hi> Heb. 9. 24. that is, as the High Priest having <hi>offered</hi> the great offering for <hi>expiation</hi> of sinne, carryed in the <hi>blood</hi> thereof into the <hi>most holy place,</hi> where was the <hi>Representation</hi> of the presence of God, so to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the <hi>Attonement</hi> He had made for himselfe and the <hi>people:</hi> So the Lord Christ having <hi>offered himselfe</hi> as a sweet <hi>smelling Sacrifice</hi>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:60108:99"/>
to God, being <hi>sprinkled</hi> with his own blood, appeares in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, as it were to <hi>mind him</hi> of the ingagement <hi>made to him,</hi> or the Redemption of sinners by <hi>his blood,</hi> and the making out the <hi>good things</hi> to them which were procured thereby; and so this appearance of his hath an <hi>influence</hi> into <hi>Purchased</hi> Grace, in as much as thereby he puts in his <hi>claime</hi> for it, in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He procureth the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> for us, effectually to <hi>collate</hi> and bestow all this <hi>purchased</hi> Grace upon us: That he would doe <hi>this,</hi> and doth it for us, we have his Ingagement, Ioh. 14. 16. This is purchased Grace, in respect of its fountain and spring; of which I shall not speake farther at present, seeing I must handle it at large, in the matter of the <hi>Communion we have with the Holy Ghost.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Of <hi>Acceptation</hi> with God; out of Christ, we are in a state of <hi>Alienation</hi> from God: accepted neither in <hi>our Persons,</hi> nor our <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>accepted.</hi> Not only all causes of quarrell were to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, that so we shouldnot be under <hi>displeasure;</hi> but also that was to be given untous, that makes us the <hi>objects</hi> of God's <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi> and <hi>pleasure:</hi> on the account of the want whereof we are <hi>distanced</hi> from God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It gives a Removeall of that for which we are refused. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>3</label> This is <hi>sinne</hi> in the <hi>guilt,</hi> and all the <hi>attendencies</hi> thereof.

               </p>
               <p>How this is <hi>accomplished</hi> and brought about by Christ, was <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videnced</hi> in the close of the foregoing Chapter. It is the fruit <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>4</label> and effect of his <hi>death</hi> for us. <hi>Guilt</hi> of sinne was the only cause of our separation and <hi>distance</hi> from God, as hath been said. This made us obnoxious to <hi>wrath, punishment,</hi> and the whole <hi>displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> of God. On the account hereof, were we <hi>imprisoned</hi> under the curse of the Law, and given up to the <hi>power</hi> of Sathan. This is the state of our <hi>unacceptation.</hi> By his death, Christ, bearing the <hi>Curse,</hi> undergoing the <hi>punishment</hi> that was due to us, paying the <hi>ransome</hi> that was due for us, delivers us from this <hi>condition.</hi> And thus farre, the death of Christ, is the <hi>sole</hi> cause of our <hi>Acceptation</hi> with God; that all cause of <hi>quarrell</hi> and rejection of us, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by taken away: and to that end, are his <hi>sufferings</hi> reckoned to us: For being <hi>made sinne for us,</hi> 2 Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. 21. He is made <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse unto us,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 31.</p>
               <p>But yet farther, This will not <hi>compleat</hi> our Acceptation with God. The old <hi>quarrell</hi> may be laid aside, and yet, no new <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>friendship</hi> begun. We may be <hi>not sinners,</hi> and yet not be so farre <hi>Righteous,</hi> as to have a right to the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of Heaven. <hi>Adam</hi> had no <hi>right</hi> to life, because he was <hi>innocent,</hi> he must moreover <hi>doe this,</hi> and then he shall live: He must not only have a <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Righteousnesse, he was not guilty of any <hi>thing;</hi> but also a <hi>positive</hi> Righteousnesse, he must doe <hi>all</hi> things.</p>
               <p>This then is required in the second place to our <hi>compleat ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation,</hi> that we have not only the <hi>not imputation</hi> of <hi>sinne,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a <hi>reckoning of Righteousnesse.</hi> Now this we have, in the <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> of the life of <hi>Christ.</hi> This also was discovered in the last Chapter. The obedience of the life of Christ was for us, is imputed to us and is our righteousnesse before God: <hi>by his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>

are we <hi>made righteous,</hi> Rom. 5. 18. On what score the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of Faith</hi> takes place, shall be afterwards declared.</p>

So hath Christ dealt with that which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us; and not only so; but also he puts that upon us, for which we are <hi>received</hi> into favour: He makes us <hi>comely</hi> through his <hi>beauty:</hi> gives us white <hi>rayment</hi> to stand before the Lord. This is the first part of <hi>purchased Grace</hi> wherein the Saints have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Jesus Christ. In remission of sin, and imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Righteousnesse doth it consist: from the <hi>death</hi> of Christ, as a <hi>price, sacrifice,</hi> and a <hi>punishment;</hi> from the <hi>life</hi> of Christ spent in obedience to the Law doth it arise. The great product it is of the Fathers <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> Wisedome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Love and Grace; the great and astonishable <hi>fruit</hi> of the Love and condescension of the <hi>Son:</hi> The great <hi>discovery</hi> of the Holy Ghost, in the Revelation of the mystery of the Gospell.</p>
               <p>The second is Grace of <hi>Sanctification;</hi> He makes us not only <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>7</label> 
                  <hi>accepted,</hi> but also <hi>acceptable.</hi> He doth not only <hi>purchase Love,</hi> for his Saints but also makes them <hi>lovely.</hi> He came not by <hi>blood only,</hi> but by <hi>water,</hi> and <hi>blood.</hi> He doth not only <hi>Justify</hi> his Saints from the <hi>guilt</hi> of sinne, but also <hi>sanctify</hi> and wash them from the <hi>filth of sinne:</hi> the first is from his <hi>life</hi> and <hi>death</hi> as a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of Propitiaton, this from his <hi>death</hi> as a purchase, and his <hi>life</hi> as an example. So the Apostle Heb. 9. 14. as also Eph. 5. 26, 27. Two things are eminent in this <hi>Issue</hi> of Purchased Grace; 1. The <hi>removall of defilement;</hi> 2. The bestowing of <hi>cleannesse,</hi> in Actuall Grace.</p>
               <p>For the first, it is also <hi>threefold;</hi> 1. The <hi>habituall</hi> cleansing of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>8</label> our nature. We are <hi>naturally uncleane,</hi> defiled; <hi>habitually</hi> so. For <hi>who can bring a cleane thing, from that which is uncleane,</hi> Job. 14. 4. <hi>That which is borne of the flesh is flesh</hi> Joh. 3. 6. It is in the pollution of our blood that we are borne, Ezek. 16. wholly defiled and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60108:100"/>
polluted. The Grace of <hi>Sanctification</hi> purchased by the <hi>blood</hi> of Christ removes this defilement of our nature. 1 Cor. 6. 11. <hi>Such were some of you, but ye are washed, ye are Sanctifyed.</hi> So also Tit. 3. 3, 4, 5. He <hi>hath saved us by the washing of Regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost.</hi> How far this originall, habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall pollution is <hi>removed,</hi> need not be disputed. It is certaine the soule is made <hi>faire</hi> and <hi>beautifull</hi> in the sight of God. Though the sinne that doth <hi>defile</hi> remaines; yet its habituall <hi>defilement,</hi> is taken away. But the handling of this lys not in my ayme.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Taking away the <hi>Pollutions</hi> of all our <hi>actuall transgressions:</hi> There is a <hi>defilement</hi> attending every actuall sinne. Our own <hi>cloaths</hi> make us to be <hi>abhorred</hi> Job. 9. 31. A spot, a staine, rust, wrinkle, filth, blood attends every sinne. Now 1 Joh. 1. 7. <hi>the blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all sinne.</hi> Besides the defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our natures which he purgeth, Tit. 1. 15. he takes away the <hi>defilement of our Persons</hi> by actuall follies: by one <hi>offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring He Pefected for ever them that are Sanctifyed:</hi> By himselfe He <hi>purged our sinnes</hi> before He sate down at the right hand of <hi>Majesty on high</hi> Heb. 1. 3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In our best dutys we have defilement: Isa. 64 6. Selfe, Unbeliefe, Forme, <hi>drop</hi> themselves into all that we doe We may be ashamed of our <hi>choysest performances:</hi> God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that the Saints good workes shall <hi>follow them;</hi> truely were they to be measured by the <hi>Rule</hi> as they come from us, and weighed in the <hi>ballance</hi> of the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> it might be well for us that they might be buried for ever: but the Lord Christ, first as our <hi>High Priest</hi> beares the <hi>iniquity,</hi> the guilt and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which in severe Justice doth attend them: Exod. 28. 37. 38. and not only so but he washes away all their <hi>filth</hi> and <hi>defilements.</hi> He is as a Refiners fire, to purge both the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Levi</hi> and their <hi>offerings:</hi> adding moreover <hi>sweet incense</hi> to them that they may be accepted. Whatever is of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> of <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> that remaines; whatever is of <hi>selfe, flesh, unbeliefe</hi> that is hay and stubble, that he <hi>consumes, wasts, takes away.</hi> So that the Saints good workes shall <hi>meet</hi> them one day, with a <hi>changed countenance,</hi> that they shall scarce <hi>know them;</hi> that which seemed to them to be <hi>black, deformed, defiled,</hi> shall appeare <hi>beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:60108:101"/>
and <hi>glorious:</hi> they shall not be <hi>affraid</hi> of them, but <hi>rejoyce</hi> to see them follow them.</p>
               <p>And this cleansing of our <hi>Natures, Persons,</hi> and <hi>dutys,</hi> hath its <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>9</label> 
                  <hi>whole</hi> foundation in the <hi>death</hi> of Christ. Hence our <hi>washing</hi> and <hi>purifying,</hi> our <hi>cleansing</hi> and <hi>purging</hi> is ascribed to his blood and the sprinkling thereof. Meritoriously this worke is done by the <hi>shedding</hi> of the blood of Christ; efficiently by its <hi>sprinkling.</hi> The sprinkling of the blood of Christ <hi>proceedeth</hi> from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the Holy Ghost; which he <hi>promiseth</hi> to us, as purchased by him for us. He is the pure water, wherewith we are <hi>sprinkled</hi> from all our sins. That spirit of <hi>Judgement</hi> and <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> that takes away the <hi>filth and blood of the daughters of Syon.</hi> And this is the first <hi>thing</hi> in the Grace of <hi>Sanctification.</hi> Of which more afterwards.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By bestowing <hi>cleanesse,</hi> as to actuall Grace. The blood <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>10</label> of Christ in this purchased Grace doth not only take away <hi>defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but also it gives <hi>purity:</hi> &amp; that also in a threefold gradation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It gives the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Holinesse to <hi>dwell</hi> in us; He is made unto us Sanctification 2 Cor. 1. 31. by procuring for us the <hi>Spirit of Sanctification:</hi> our <hi>renewing</hi> is of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> who is <hi>shed on</hi> us through Christ alone Tit. 3. 6. this the Apostle mainly insists on. Rom. 8. to wit, that the <hi>prime</hi> and <hi>principall</hi> guift of <hi>Sanctification</hi> that we receive from Christ, is the <hi>indwelling</hi> of the Spirit, and our following after the <hi>guidance thereof.</hi> But what concernes the <hi>Spirit</hi> in any kind, must be referred to that which I have to offer concerning our <hi>Communion</hi> with him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He gives us <hi>Habituall Grace:</hi> a <hi>principle</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> opposed to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>11</label> the principle of lust that is in us by nature. This is the Grace that dwells in us; makes its <hi>abode</hi> with us, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the distinct <hi>faculties</hi> of our soules wherein it is, or the distinct <hi>objects</hi> about which it is exercised, receiveth various <hi>Appellations,</hi> being indeed all but one <hi>new</hi> principle of life. In the understanding it is <hi>light,</hi> in the will <hi>obedience,</hi> in the Affections <hi>love,</hi> in all <hi>Faith.</hi> So also it is differenced in respect of its <hi>operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> when it carries out the soule to rest on Christ, it is <hi>Faith;</hi> when to delight in him, it is Love; but still one and the same <hi>habit</hi> of Grace. And this is the second thing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Actuall influence</hi> for the <hi>performance</hi> of every spirituall <hi>duty</hi> whatever. After the Saints have both the <hi>former,</hi> yet Christ <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>12</label>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:60108:101"/>
tels them that without him <hi>they can doe nothing,</hi> Joh. 15. 5. They are still in dependance upon him, for new <hi>influences of Grace,</hi> or supplys of the spirit, they cannot <hi>live</hi> and spend upon the <hi>old stock:</hi> for every new act they must have <hi>new</hi> Grace: He must worke in us to <hi>will and to doe of his good pleasure,</hi> Phil. 2. 13. And in these three thus briefely named consists that purchased Grace in the point of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> as to the collating of purity and cleannesse wherein we have Communion with Christ.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this purchased Grace consists, in <hi>priviledges to stand before</hi> God, and these are of two sorts: 1. <hi>Primary.</hi> 2. <hi>Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall:</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>13</label> Primary is <hi>Adoption:</hi> The Spirit of Adoption: Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentiall, are all the favours of the Gospell, which the Saints alone have right unto. But of this I shall speake when I come to the last branch of Communion with the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>These are the things wherein we have <hi>Communion</hi> with Christ, as to <hi>purchased Grace</hi> in this life. Drive them up to <hi>perfection,</hi> and you have that which we call <hi>everlasting</hi> Glory; perfect <hi>Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> perfect Holinesse, perfect <hi>Adoption,</hi> or inheritance of <hi>Sonnes,</hi> that's Glory.</p>
               <p>Our processe now in the <hi>next</hi> place is to what I mainely in tend, even the manner how we hold <hi>Communion</hi> with Christ in <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>14</label> these things: and that in the order laid down, as</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How the Saints hold Communion with Christ as to their Acceptation with God. What is required on the part of Christ, hereunto: in his Intention: In the declaration thereof. The summe of our acceptation with God wherein it consists. What is required on the part of Believers to this Communion: and how they hold it with Christ. Some objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons proposed to consideration: why the Elect are not accepted imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately on the undertaking, and death of Christ: in what sense they are so: Christ a Common or publique person. How he came to be so: The way of our acceptation with God on that account: The second objection. The necessity of our obedience stated: Ephes. 2. 8, 9, 10. The Grounds, Causes and Ends of it manifested. Its proper place in the new Covenant. How the Saints in particular hold Communion with Christ in this purchased Grace.

               </argument>
               <p>COmmunion with Christ, in purchased Grace, as unto <hi>Acceptation</hi> with God, from the Obedience of his <hi>Life,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>1</label> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of his <hi>death,</hi> is the first thing we enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. The discovery of what on the part of Christ, and what on our part is required thereunto (for our mutuall actings, even his and ours are necessary, that we may have fellowship and Communion together herein,) is that which herein I intend.</p>
               <p n="1">1. On the part of Christ there is no more required but these <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>2</label> two things 1. That what he did, He did not for himselfe but for us, 2. What he suffered, he suffered not for himselfe but for us. That is, that his intention from Eternity, &amp; when he was in the World, was that all that he <hi>did</hi> and <hi>suffered,</hi> was &amp; should be for us, and our <hi>advantage</hi> as to our <hi>Acceptance</hi> with God: That he still continueth <hi>making</hi> use of what he so did and suffered, for that end and purpose, and that only. Now this is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p>What he did, he did for us, and not for himselfe: <hi>He was made</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>3</label> 
                  <hi>under the Law, that we might receive the Adoption of Sonnes</hi> Gal. 4. 4, 5. He was made <hi>under the Law,</hi> that is, in that condition that
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:60108:102"/>
he was obnoxious to the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>commands</hi> of it: and why was this? to what <hi>end?</hi> for himself? no, but to <hi>redeem</hi> us, is the ayme of all that He did, of all his obedience: &amp; that he did. This very intention in what he <hi>did,</hi> he acquaints us with Joh. 17. 19. <hi>for their sakes I sanctify my self, that they may be sanctifyed through the truth; I san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify my selfe, dedicate</hi> &amp; set my selfe apart to all that work I have to do. I came not to doe my <hi>own will,</hi> I came to save that which <hi>was lost,</hi> to minister, not to be ministred unto, and to give my <hi>life a ransome,</hi> It was the Testimony he <hi>bare</hi> to all he did in the world. This Intendment of his is especially to be eyed. From Eternity he had thoughts of what he would doe for us, and <hi>delighted</hi> himselfe therein. And when he was in the world, in all He went about, he had still this thought, this is for them, and and this is for them, my beloved: When he went to be <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,</hi> says <hi>John, I have need to come to thee, and comest thou to me?</hi> Math. 3. 14, 15. as if he had said, thou hast no need at all of it. But says <hi>Christ, suffer us now for so it becometh us to fullfill all Righteousnesse,</hi> I doe it for them who have none at all, and stand obliged unto all, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>4</label>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In what He <hi>suffered,</hi> this is more cleare. Dan. 9. 21. <hi>Messias shall be cut off,</hi> and not for himselfe: and the Apostle lays down this as a main difference between <hi>him,</hi> and the <hi>High priest</hi> of the Jewes that when they made their <hi>solemne offerings,</hi> they offer'd <hi>first for themselves</hi> and then for the <hi>People:</hi> But Jesus Christ offereth only for <hi>others:</hi> He had no sinne and could make no Sacrifice for his own sinne, which he had not, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for others. He tasted death <hi>for all</hi> Heb. 2. 9. <hi>gave his life a ransome for many</hi> Math. 20. 10. The iniquity of us all was <hi>made to meet on him</hi> Isa. 53. 6. he bare our sinne, <hi>in his body on the tree</hi> 1 Pet. 1. loved his Church and gave himselfe for it: Ephes. 5. 26. Gal. 2. 20. Rom. 4. 25. Revel. 1. 5, 6. Tit. 2. 14. 1 Tim. 2. 6. Isa. 53, 12. Joh. 17. 19. But this is exceeding cleare and confessed, that Christ in his <hi>suffering</hi> and oblation, had his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention only upon the <hi>good</hi> of his <hi>Elect,</hi> and their Acceptation with God; suffering for us, the just for the <hi>unjust that he might bring us to God.</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>5</label>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly to compleat this <hi>Communion</hi> on the part of Christ, it is required first that there he added to what he hath done, the Gospell <hi>tenders</hi> of that compleat Righteousnesse and <hi>Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:60108:103"/>
with God, which ariseth from his <hi>perfect Obedience</hi> and suffe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rings. Now they are twofold.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Declaratory,</hi> in the conditionall <hi>Promises</hi> of the Gospell. Joh. 7. 37. Math. 11. 28. <hi>He that believeth shall be saved:</hi> come to <hi>me and you shall have life:</hi> as the <hi>Serpent was lifted up &amp;c. Christ is the end of the Law of Righteousnesse to them that believe,</hi> Rom. 10. 4. and innumerable others. Now <hi>declaratory tenders</hi> are very preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; there is much <hi>kindnesse</hi> in them, and if they be rejected, they will be the <hi>savour of death unto death:</hi> but the Lord Christ knows that the outward letter though never so <hi>effectually</hi> held out, will not enable any of his for that reception of his <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,</hi> which is necessary to interest them therein; wherefore 2. In this tender of Acceptation with God, on the account of what he hath done and suffered, a Law is <hi>established,</hi> that whosoever <hi>receives</hi> it, shall be so accepted. But Christ knows the condition and <hi>state</hi> of his in this World. This will not <hi>doe.</hi> If he do not effectually <hi>invest</hi> them with it, all is lost. Therefore</p>
               <p n="2">2 He sends them his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to <hi>quicken</hi> them, Ioh. 6. 63. to cause them that are <hi>dead to heare his voyce,</hi> Ioh. 5. And to work in them, what ever is required of them, to make them partakers of his righteousnesse, and <hi>accepted with God.</hi> Thus doth Christ <hi>deale</hi> with his; He <hi>lives</hi> and <hi>dyes</hi> with an intention to work out, and <hi>compleat righteousnesse</hi> for them: their enjoying of it, to a perfect <hi>Acceptation</hi> before God, is all that in the one and other he aymed at. Then he <hi>tenders</hi> it unto them, declares the <hi>usefullnesse</hi> and <hi>pretiousnesse</hi> of it to their Soules, stirring them up to a <hi>desire</hi> and valuation of it; and lastly <hi>effectually</hi> bestowes it upon them, <hi>reckons</hi> it unto them as theirs; that they should <hi>by</hi> it, <hi>for</hi> it, <hi>with</hi> it, be perfectly accepted with his Father.</p>
               <p>Thus for our Acceptation with God, two things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>9</label>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Satisfaction</hi> be made for our <hi>disobedience,</hi> for whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we had <hi>done</hi> which might dammage the justice and Honour of God, and that God be <hi>attoned</hi> towards us, which could no otherwise be, but by undergoing the penalty of the Law. This, I have shewed <hi>abundantly</hi> is done by the death of Christ: God made him to be <hi>sinne</hi> for us, 2 Cor. 5. 21. a <hi>Curse,</hi> Gal: 3. 13. On this account we have our Absolution, our Acquitment from the guilt of sinne: the sentence of the Law, the <hi>wrath</hi> of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60108:103"/>
God, Rom. 8. 33. 38. We are <hi>justified, acquitted freed</hi> from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, because it was Christ that dyed; He bare our sins in his body on the tree, 1 Pet. 2. 24.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> of the Law be fulfilled: and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience performed that is required at our hands; and this is <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>7</label> done by the <hi>life</hi> of Christ; Rom. 5. 18, 19. So that answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hereunto, according to our <hi>state</hi> and condition, of our <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation</hi> with God, there are two parts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our <hi>Absolution</hi> from the guilt of sinne: that our <hi>Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>

               <p n="2">2. Imputation of <hi>Righteousnesse;</hi> that we may be accounted perfectly <hi>Righteous</hi> before God: and this we have by the <hi>life</hi> of Christ. His Righteousnesse in yeelding obedience to the Law, is imputed to us. And thus is our <hi>Acceptation</hi> with God <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated.</hi> Being discharged from the <hi>guilt</hi> of our disobedience by the death of Christ, and having the Righteousnesse of the <hi>Life</hi> of Christ imputed to us, we have <hi>Friendship and Peace</hi> with God. And this is that which I call our Grace of <hi>Acceptation</hi> with God, wherein we have communion with Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>That which remaines for me to doe, is, to shew how Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers hold <hi>distinct communion with Christ,</hi> in this <hi>Grace</hi> of Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>9</label> and how thereby they keep <hi>alive</hi> a sense of it, the <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>life</hi> of it being to be renewed every day. Without this, life is an Hell; no <hi>Peace,</hi> no <hi>Joy</hi> can we be made partakers of, but what hath its <hi>rise</hi> from hence. Look what grounded perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we have of our <hi>Acceptation</hi> with God, that He is at peace with us, thereunto is the <hi>revenue</hi> of our Peace, Comfort, Joy, yea and <hi>Holinesse</hi> it selfe proportioned.</p>
               <p>But yet before I come in <hi>particular</hi> to handle our <hi>practicall</hi> communion with the <hi>Lord Jesus,</hi> in this thing; I must remove <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>10</label> 
                  <hi>two considerable objections,</hi> the <hi>one</hi> of them lying against the <hi>first part</hi> of our Acceptation with God, the <hi>other</hi> against the <hi>latter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob</hi> 1. For our <hi>Absolution</hi> by, &amp; <hi>upon</hi> the death of Christ, it may be said; that if the Elect have their <hi>Absolution,</hi> Reconciliation and <hi>Freedome,</hi> by the Death, Blood and Crosse of Christ, whence is it then, that they are not all <hi>Actually absolved,</hi> at the <hi>death</hi> of Christ, or at least so soon as they are <hi>borne,</hi> but that
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60108:104"/>
many of them <hi>live</hi> a long while under the <hi>wrath</hi> of God in this world, as being <hi>Unbelievers,</hi> under the sentence and <hi>condemning</hi> power of the Law: why are they not immediately <hi>freed,</hi> upon <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 36.</note> the <hi>payment</hi> of the price, and making Reconciliation for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> 2. If the Obedience of the <hi>Life</hi> of Christ be imputed unto us, and that is <hi>our Righteousnesse</hi> before God, then what need we yeeld any <hi>Obedience</hi> our selves? is not all our <hi>praying, labouring,</hi> watching, fasting, giving almes, are not all <hi>fruits</hi> of Holinesse, in purity of heart, and usefulnesse of conversation? all in <hi>vaine,</hi> and to no purpose; and who then will or need take <hi>care</hi> to be <hi>holy, humble, righteous,</hi> meeke, temperate, patient, good, peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or to abound in good works in the World?</p>
               <p>I shall, God assisting, briefely remove these <hi>two Objections,</hi> and then proceed, to carry on <hi>the designe</hi> in hand, about our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Christ.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Jesus Christ in his <hi>undertaking</hi> of the work of our <hi>Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation</hi> with God, for which cause he came into the world, and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>11</label> the Accomplishment of it by his <hi>death,</hi> was constituted and considered as a <hi>Common publick person,</hi> in the stead of them for whose <hi>Reconciliation</hi> to God He suffered. Hence He is the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour between God and Man,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 5. that is, one who <hi>undertook</hi> to God for us, as the next words manifest, v. 6. and gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a <hi>Ransome</hi> for all: And the <hi>Surety of the new Covenant,</hi> Heb. 7. 22. undertaking for, and on the behalfe of them with whom that <hi>Covenant</hi> was made; Hence he is said to be given for a <hi>Covenant</hi> to the people, Isa. 42. 6. and a leader, 49. 8. He was the second <hi>Adam,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 45, 47. to all Ends and purposes of Righteousnesse to his <hi>spirituall</hi> seed; as the first <hi>Adam was of sin to his naturall seed,</hi> Rom. 5. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His being thus a <hi>Common Person,</hi> arose chiefely from these things: 1. In generall, from the Covenant entred into, by <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>12</label> himselfe with his Father to this purpose. The Termes of this covenant are at large insisted on, Isa. 53. summed up, Psal. 40. 7, 8. Heb: 10. 8, 9, 10. Hence the Father became to be <hi>his God</hi> which is a Covenant expression, Psal. 89. 26. Heb: 1. 5. Psal. 22. 1. Psal. 40. 8. Psal. 45. 7. Revel. 3. 12. Mich. 5. 4. So was he by his Father, on this account designed to this work, Isa. 42. 1. ch. 6. 1. ch. 49. 9. Mal. 3. 1. Zech. 13. 7. Joh. 3. 16. 1 Tim. 1. 15. Thus the <hi>Counsell of peace became to be between them both,</hi>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:60108:104"/>
Zech. 6. 13. that is the Father, and Son. And the Son rejoyces from Eternity in the thought of this undertaking, Prov. 8. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. The <hi>command</hi> given him to this purpose; the <hi>Promises</hi> made to him thereon, the assistance affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him, I have elsewhere handled.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the <hi>Soveraigne Grant,</hi> Appointment, and Designe of the Father, giving and delivering the <hi>Elect</hi> to Jesus Christ in this <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>13</label> Covenant, to be <hi>redeemed</hi> and reonciled to himselfe, Joh. 17. 6. <hi>thine they were, and thou gavest them to me.</hi> They were Gods by <hi>Eternall Designation</hi> and Election, and He gave them to Christ to be redeemed: Hence before their <hi>calling</hi> or believing, He calls them <hi>his sheep,</hi> Joh. 10. 15, 16. laying downe his life for them <hi>as such;</hi> And hence are we said to be <hi>chosen</hi> in Christ, Eph. 1. 4. or <hi>designed</hi> to obtain all the fruits of the <hi>Love</hi> of God by Christ, and committed into his hand, for that end and purpose.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In his <hi>undertaking</hi> to suffer what was <hi>due</hi> to them, and to doe what was to be <hi>done</hi> by them, that they might be <hi>delivered,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>14</label> 
                  <hi>reconciled,</hi> and <hi>accepted</hi> with God. And he undertakes to give in to the Father, without losse or miscarriage, what he had so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Father as above, Joh. 17. 2. 12. ch. 6. 37, 39. As <hi>Jacob</hi> did the cattell he received of <hi>Laban,</hi> Gen. 31. 39, 40. Of both these I have treated somewhat at large elsewhere, in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the <hi>Covenant</hi> between the Father and the Son, so that I shall not need to take it up here againe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They being <hi>given</hi> unto him, He <hi>undertaking</hi> for them, to <hi>doe</hi> and <hi>suffer,</hi> what was on their <hi>part</hi> required, He received on <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>15</label> their <hi>behalfe</hi> and for <hi>them,</hi> all the <hi>promises</hi> of all the Mercies, Grace, good things and <hi>Priviledges,</hi> which they were to receive, upon the account of his undertaking for them. On this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, Eternall life is said to be <hi>promised</hi> of God before the world began, Titus 1. 2. That is to the Son of God <hi>for us,</hi> on his <hi>undertaking</hi> on our behalfe. And <hi>Grace</hi> also is said to be <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto us</hi> before the World was, 2 Tim. 1. 9. that is in Christ our appointed <hi>head, Mediatour,</hi> and <hi>Representative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Christ being thus a <hi>Common Person,</hi> a Mediatour, <hi>Surely,</hi> and Representative of his Church, upon his <hi>undertaking,</hi> as to <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>16</label> and merit, and upon his <hi>Actuall</hi> performance as to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne <hi>declaration,</hi> was, <hi>as such, acquitted, absolved, justified</hi> and freed, from all and every thing, that on the <hi>behalfe</hi> of the Elect, as
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60108:105"/>
due to them, was charged upon him, or could so be: I say as to all the <hi>Efficacy</hi> and merit of his undertakings, He was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately <hi>absolved</hi> upon his <hi>faithfulnesse,</hi> in his first engagement: and thereby all the <hi>Saints</hi> of the Old Testament, were saved by his <hi>blood</hi> no lesse then we. As to <hi>solemne declaration,</hi> He was so absolved, when the <hi>paines of Death being loosed, He was declared to be the Sonne of God with power,</hi> Rom. 1. 4. By the Resurrection from the dead; God saying to him, <hi>thou art my Sonne, this day have I begotten thee,</hi> Psal. 15. 33. And this his <hi>Absolution</hi> doth Christ expresse his confidence of, Isa. 50. 6, 7, 8, 9. And he was justified, 1 Tim. 3. 16. That which I intend by this <hi>Absolution of Christ as a publick person, is this;</hi> God having made him <hi>under the Law</hi> for them who were so, Gal. 4. 4. in their <hi>stead,</hi> obnoxious to the <hi>punishment</hi> due to sinne, made him sinne, 2 Cor, 5. 21. and so gave <hi>Justice,</hi> and <hi>Law,</hi> and all the consequents of the <hi>Curse</hi> thereof, power against him, Isa. 53. 6. upon his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going of <hi>that</hi> which was required of <hi>him,</hi> Isa. 53. 12. God loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the <hi>paines</hi> and power of death, <hi>accepts</hi> him, and is well <hi>pleased</hi> with him, as to the performance and discharge of his <hi>work,</hi> Ioh. 17. 3, 4, 5, 6. pronounceth him <hi>free</hi> from the obligation that was <hi>on him,</hi> Act. 13. and gave him a <hi>promise</hi> of all the good things He aymed at, and which his soule desired. Hereon are all the <hi>Promises</hi> of God made to Christ, and their accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, all the incouragements given him to <hi>aske</hi> and make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the things originally <hi>ingaged</hi> for to him, Psal. 2. 8. which he did accordingly, Ioh. 17. founded, and built. And here lies the certain stable foundation, of our <hi>Absolution,</hi> and acceptation with God. Christ in our stead, acting for us as our <hi>surety,</hi> being acquitted, absolved, solemnely declared to have answered the whole debt that was incumbent on him to pay, and made satisfaction for all the injury we had done, a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Pardon</hi> is sealed for us all, to be <hi>sued</hi> out particularly in the way to be appointed. For,</p>
               <p>Christ as a <hi>publick</hi> person being thus <hi>absolved,</hi> it became <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> with God, a Righteous thing, from the <hi>Covenant,</hi> compact, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>17</label> and convention, that was between him and the Mediatour, that <hi>those</hi> in whose stead he was, should <hi>obtaine,</hi> and have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on them, all the <hi>fruits</hi> of his death, in <hi>Reconciliation</hi> with God, Rom. 5. 8, 9, 10, 11. That as Christ received the <hi>Generall</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:60108:105"/>
                  <hi>acquittance</hi> for them all, so that they should <hi>every one of them,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it respectively. This is every where manifested in those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, which expresse a <hi>Commutation</hi> designed by God, in this matter, as 2 Cor. 5. 21. Gal. 3. 13. 1. Pet. 2. 21, 24. of which afterwards.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Being thus acquitted in the Covenant of the Mediatour, (whence they are said to be <hi>circumcised</hi> with him, to <hi>dye</hi> with <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>18</label> him, to be <hi>buried</hi> with him, to <hi>rise</hi> with him, to sit with him in heavenly places, namely in the Covenant of the Mediatour,) and it being Righteous, that they should be acquitted <hi>Personal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> in the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace, it was determined by Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghost, that the way of their Actuall Personall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from the <hi>sentence</hi> and curse of the Law, should be <hi>in</hi> and <hi>by</hi> such a <hi>way</hi> and dispensation, as might lead to the <hi>praise of the Glorious Grace of God,</hi> Ehpes. 1. 5, 6, 7. The Appointment of God is that we shall have the <hi>Adoption of Children.</hi> The <hi>meanes</hi> of it is by Jesus Christ: the peculiar way of bringing it about, is by the <hi>Redemption</hi> that is in his blood, the end is the <hi>praise of his glorious Grace.</hi> And thence it is, that</p>
               <p n="8">8. Untill the full time of their <hi>Actuall deliverance,</hi> determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">9. 19.</note> and appointed to them in their severall generations, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, they are <hi>Personally</hi> under the curse of the Law, and on that account are <hi>Legally</hi> obnoxious to the wrath of God, from which they shall certainly be <hi>delivered.</hi> I say, they are thus personally obnoxious to the <hi>Law</hi> and the Curse thereof, but not at all with its primitive intention of <hi>execution</hi> upon them, but as it is a meanes appointed to help forward their <hi>acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> with Christ and acceptance with God, on his account; when this is accomplished, that whole obligation ceases; being <hi>continued</hi> on them in a designe of Love; their last condition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such, as that they cannot without it, be brought to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of Christ, to the prayse of the Glorious Grace of God.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The End of the <hi>dispensation</hi> of Grace, being to glorify the whole <hi>Trinity,</hi> the order fixed on, and appointed, wherein this <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>20</label> is to be done, is, by <hi>ascending</hi> to the Fathers Love, through the <hi>workes</hi> of the Spirit, and <hi>blood</hi> of the Sonne. The emanation of Divine Love to us, begins with the <hi>Father,</hi> is carried on by the <hi>Sonne,</hi> and then communicated by the <hi>Spirit:</hi> the Father <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing,</hi>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:60108:106"/>
the Son <hi>Purchasing,</hi> the Spirit effectually <hi>working,</hi> which is their order. Our participation, is first by the <hi>work</hi> of the Spirit, to an actuall interest in the <hi>blood</hi> of the Sonne, whence we have <hi>Acceptation</hi> with the Father.</p>
               <p>This then is the <hi>Order,</hi> whereby we are brought to Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Father, for the <hi>Glory</hi> of God through Christ. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>21</label>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Spirit</hi> may be glorified, He is given unto us, to <hi>quicken</hi> us, convert us, work <hi>Faith</hi> in us, Rom. 8, 11. Ephes. 1. 19, 20. according to all the <hi>promises</hi> of the Covenant, Isa. 4. 4, 5. Ezek. 19. 11. Ezek. 36. 26.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This being wrought in us, for the <hi>Glory</hi> of the Sonne, we are actually interested according to the <hi>tenour</hi> of the Covenant, at the same instant of time, in the <hi>blood</hi> of Christ, as to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits which he hath procured for us thereby. Yea this very work of the <hi>Spirit it selfe,</hi> is a fruit, and part of the <hi>purchase</hi> of Christ: but we speak of our <hi>sense</hi> of this thing, whereunto the communication of the spirit is <hi>antecedent.</hi> And</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the <hi>Glory of the Father,</hi> we are accepted with him, <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, freed</hi> from <hi>guilt, pardoned,</hi> and have peace with God, Rom. 5. 1. Thus, <hi>through Christ we have Accesse by one spirit unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> 2 Ephes. 2. 18. And thus are both Father and Sonne, and the Holy Spirit, <hi>Glorified</hi> in our justification, and acceptation with God: the Father in his <hi>Free Love,</hi> the Sonne in his <hi>Full purchase,</hi> and the Holy Spirit in his <hi>effectuall working.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. All <hi>this,</hi> in all the <hi>parts</hi> of it, is no lesse fully <hi>procured</hi> for us, nor lesse <hi>freely</hi> bestowed on us, for Christs sake and on his <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>22</label> account, as part of his purchase and <hi>merits;</hi> then if all of us <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly</hi> upon his death, had been translated into Heaven; only this <hi>way</hi> of our deliverance and freedome, is fixed on, that the whole <hi>Trinity</hi> may be glorified thereby. And this may suffice in answer to the first Objection. Though our <hi>Reconciliation</hi> with God be fully and compleatly <hi>procured</hi> by the death of Christ, and all the <hi>ways</hi> and meanes whereby it is <hi>accomplished,</hi> yet we are brought unto an <hi>Actuall</hi> enjoyment thereof, by the <hi>way</hi> and in the <hi>order</hi> mentioned, for the praise of the <hi>Glorious Grace of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second Objection is, <hi>that if the Righteousnesse and Obedience of Christ to the Law, be imputed unto us, then what need we yeild Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>23</label> 
                  <hi>our selves.</hi> To this also I shall returne answer as briefely as I can, in the ensuing Observations: Then</p>

                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:60108:106"/>
1. The placeing of our <hi>Gospell Obedience,</hi> on the right foot of account, that it may neither be <hi>exalted</hi> into a state, <hi>condition,</hi> Use, nor End, not given it of God, nor any <hi>Reason,</hi> Cause, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, end, necessity of it on the other hand, taken away, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kned or impaired, is a matter of Great importance. Some make our <hi>Obedience,</hi> the workes of Faith, our <hi>workes,</hi> the matter or cause of our <hi>Justification;</hi> Some the <hi>condition</hi> of the Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> of Christ, some the qualification of the Person justifyed, on the one hand; some exclude all the <hi>necessity</hi> of them, and turne the <hi>Grace of God into lasciviousnesse</hi> on the other. To debate these <hi>differences,</hi> is not my present businesse: only I say, on this and other accounts, the right stating of our <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> is of great importance as to our walking with God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We doe by no meanes, assigne the <hi>same place, condition,</hi> state and use, to the <hi>Obedience</hi> of Christ, imputed to us, and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>24</label> our Obedience <hi>performed</hi> to God. If we did, they were really inconsistent. And therefore those, who affirme that our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is the <hi>Condition</hi> or <hi>Cause</hi> of our Justification, doe all of them deny, the <hi>Imputation</hi> of the Obedience of Christ unto us. The Righteousnesse of Christ is imputed to us, as that on the account whereof we are <hi>accepted,</hi> and esteemed Righteous before God, and are <hi>really</hi> so, though not inherently. We are as <hi>truly</hi> Righteous with the <hi>Obedience</hi> of Christ, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us, as <hi>Adam</hi> was or could have been, by a <hi>compleat</hi> Righteousnesse of his own performance. So Rom. 5. 18. by his <hi>Obedience we are made Righteous;</hi> made so truely, and so <hi>accepted,</hi> as by the disobedience of <hi>Adam</hi> we are truely made <hi>Trespassours</hi> and so <hi>accounted.</hi> And this is that which the Apostle desires to be found in, in opposition to his <hi>Own Righteousnesse</hi> Phil. 3 9. But our <hi>own Obedience</hi> is not the <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> whereupon we are <hi>accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> and justifyed before God; although it be <hi>acceptable</hi> to God, that we should abound therein. And this distinction the Apostle doth evidently deliver and <hi>confirme,</hi> so as nothing can be more cleerly <hi>revealed,</hi> Eph. 2. 8, 9, 10. <hi>For by Grace we are Saved through Faith. and this not of our selves. It is the guift of God. Not of workes, least any man should boast. For we are his workes manship, created in Christ Jesus unto good workes which God hath prepared that we should walke in them. We are saved,</hi> or <hi>justifyed</hi> (for that it is whereof the Apostle treats) <hi>by Grace through Faith,</hi> which receives Jesus Christ and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60108:107"/>
his Obedience: <hi>not of workes least any man should boast:</hi> but what workes are they that the Apostle intends? The <hi>workes of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> as in the very beginning of the next words, is manifest; for <hi>we are;</hi> we <hi>Believers,</hi> with our Obedience and our workes, of whom I speake: yea but what need then of workes; need still there is, <hi>we are the workmanship &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things the Apostle intimates in these words:</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Reason why we cannot be saved by workes: namely because we doe them not in, or by our own <hi>strength,</hi> which is necessary we should doe if we will be <hi>saved</hi> by them, or <hi>justifyed</hi> by them: but this is not so saith the Apostle, for <hi>we are the workemanship of God &amp;c.</hi> all our <hi>workes</hi> are <hi>wrought</hi> in us, by full and Effectuall undeserved Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An Assertion of the necessity of good workes, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that we are not saved by them, and that is, that God <hi>has ordained</hi> that we shall walke in them: which is a sufficient ground of our <hi>Obedience</hi> what ever be the use of it.</p>
               <p>If you will say then, what are the true and proper <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>25</label> Grounds, <hi>Reasons,</hi> Uses, and Motives of our Obedience, whence the necessity thereof may be <hi>demonstrated,</hi> and our soules be <hi>stirred</hi> up, to abound and be fruitfull therein? I say they are so many &amp; lye so deep in the <hi>Mystery of the Gospell,</hi> and Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Grace, spread themselves so throughout the <hi>whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> of the will of God unto us, that to handle them <hi>fully</hi> and distinctly, and to give them their <hi>due weight,</hi> is a thing that I cannot engage in, least I should be turned aside from what I principally intend. I shall only give you some briefe heads of what might at large be insisted on.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our universall Obedience, and good workes, are indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensably necessary from the soveraigne appointment and <hi>will</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>26</label> of God: Father. Son, and Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In Generall: <hi>this is the will of God, even our Sanctification,</hi> or Holinesse 1 Thess. 4. 3. this is that which God <hi>wills,</hi> which he <hi>requires</hi> of us, that we be <hi>holy,</hi> that we be obedient. That we do his will as the <hi>Angells</hi> doe in Heaven: The Equity, <hi>necessity profit</hi> and advantage of this ground of our Obedience, might at large be insisted on. And were there no more, this might suffice alone. If it be the will of God, it is our <hi>duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Father</hi> hath <hi>ordeined</hi> or appointed it: it is the will
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:60108:107"/>
of the <hi>Father</hi> Ephes. 2. 10. the <hi>Father</hi> is spoken of personally; Christ being mentioned as Mediator.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Sonne hath ordained and appointed it as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Joh. 15, 16. <hi>I have ordained you that you should bring forth fruite,</hi> (of Obedience) and that it should <hi>remaine.</hi> And</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> appoints and Ordaines <hi>Believers</hi> to workes of Obedience and Holinesse, and to <hi>worke holinesse</hi> in others: So in particular, Act. 13. 2. He appoints and designes men to the great worke of <hi>Obedience</hi> in preaching the <hi>Gospell,</hi> and in sinning, men sinne against him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our <hi>Holinesse,</hi> our Obedience, worke of <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> is <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>27</label> one eminent and especiall end of the peculiar dispensation of <hi>Father, Sonne,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> in the businesse of <hi>exalting</hi> the Glory of God in our <hi>Salvation:</hi> of the Electing <hi>love</hi> of the Father: the Purchasing <hi>love</hi> of the Sonne: And the <hi>Operative love</hi> of the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a peculiar end of the <hi>Electing love</hi> of the Father: Ephes. 1. 4. <hi>He hath chosen us that we should be holy and unblameable.</hi> So Isa. 4. 3, 4. His aime and designe in <hi>choosing</hi> of us was, that we should be <hi>Holy,</hi> and <hi>unblameable before him in love.</hi> This he is to accomplish and will bring about in them that are his. <hi>He chooses us to Salvation, through the sanctification of the Spirit, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of the truth:</hi> 2 Thess. 2. 12. This the Father designed as the first and immediate end of Electing love: And proposes the Consideration of that <hi>Love,</hi> as a <hi>motive</hi> to Holinesse. 1 Joh. 4. 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is so also of the exceeding love of the Son, whereof the Testimonys are innumerable. I shall give but <hi>one</hi> or two: Tit. 2. 14. <hi>Who gave himselfe for us, that he might redeem us from all inquity, and purify to himselfe a peculiar people zealous of good workes.</hi> This was his aime his designe in giving himselfe for us: as Ephes. 5. 26, 27. <hi>Christ loved the Church and gave himselfe for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word: that he might present it to himselfe a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish.</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 15. Rom. 6. 5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is the very worke of the <hi>Love</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost:</hi> his whole worke upon us, <hi>in</hi> us, <hi>for</hi> us consists in <hi>preparing</hi> of us for Obedience, <hi>enabling</hi> of us thereunto, and <hi>bringing</hi> forth the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60108:108"/>
fruits of it, in us: and this he doth in opposition to a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of our own, either before <hi>it,</hi> or to be made up by it: Tit. 3. 5. I need not insist on this: The fruits of the Spirit in us are known Gal. 5. 22.</p>
               <p>And thus have we a twofold <hi>bottome</hi> of the necessity of our Obedience, and personall Holinesse: <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>appointed</hi> it. He requires it. And it is an eminent immediate <hi>End</hi> of the distinct dispensation of <hi>Father, Sonne,</hi> and <hi>Hoy Ghost,</hi> in the worke of our Salvation. If Gods <hi>Soveraignty</hi> over us is to be owned; If his <hi>Love</hi> towards us be to be <hi>regarded,</hi> if the whole worke of the ever blessed <hi>Trinity,</hi> for us, in us, be of any <hi>moment,</hi> our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is <hi>necessary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is necessary in respect of the <hi>end</hi> thereof: and that <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>28</label> whether you Consider God, our selves, or the world.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The end of our <hi>Obedience</hi> in respect of God, is his Glory and Honour, Mal. 1. 6. This is Gods <hi>honour,</hi> all that we give him. It is true, he will take his honour from the <hi>stoutest</hi> and proudest Rebell in the world: but all we <hi>give</hi> him, is in our Obedience. The Glorifying of God by our Obedience, is all that we are or can be. Particularly,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is the Glory of the <hi>Father:</hi> Mat. 5. 16. <hi>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your Good workes, and Glorify your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven.</hi> By our walking in the <hi>light of Faith,</hi> doth Glory arise to the Father. The fruits of his <hi>Love,</hi> of his <hi>Grace,</hi> of his <hi>Kindnesse.</hi> are seen upon us; and God is glorifyed in our behalfe: And</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Sonne is <hi>Glorifyed</hi> thereby. It is the will of God, that as all men <hi>honour the Father,</hi> so should they <hi>honour the Sonne:</hi> Joh. 5. 23. and how is this done, by <hi>believing</hi> in him, Joh. 14. 1. <hi>obeying</hi> of him. Hence, Joh. 17. 10. He says, He is <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed in Believers:</hi> and prays for an increase of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> for them, that he may yet be more <hi>Glorifyed,</hi> and all might know that as <hi>Mediator</hi> he was sent of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Spirit is Glorifyed also by it: He is grieved by our <hi>Disobedience</hi> Ephes. 4. 30. and therefore his Glory is in our bringing forth fruit. He dwells in us as in his <hi>Temple:</hi> which is not to be defiled; Holinesse becometh his <hi>Habitation</hi> for ever.</p>
               <p>Now if this that hath been said, be not sufficient to evince a
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60108:108"/>
necessity of our <hi>Obedience,</hi> we must suppose our selves to speake with a sort of men, who regard neither the <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> nor Love, nor <hi>Glory</hi> of God, <hi>Father, Son,</hi> or <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> Let men say what they please, though our Obedience should be all <hi>lost,</hi> and never <hi>regarded,</hi> which is impossible, (for God is not unjust to forget our labour of love) yet here is a sufficient bottome, ground and Reason of yeilding more <hi>Obedience</hi> unto God, then ever we shall <hi>doe,</hi> whilst we live in this world. I speake also only of <hi>Gospell</hi> Grounds of Obedience, and not of those that are <hi>Naturall</hi> and <hi>Legall,</hi> which are indispensable to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The end in respect of our selves immediately, is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>29</label> 1. Honour. 2. Peace. 3. Usefullnesse.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Honour:</hi> It is by <hi>Holinesse</hi> that we are made <hi>like unto God,</hi> and his Image is renewed <hi>againe</hi> in us. This was our <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> at our Creation; this exalted us above all our <hi>fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> here below; we were made in the Image of God. This we lost by <hi>sinne,</hi> and became like the <hi>beasts</hi> that perish. To this <hi>honour</hi> of conformity to God, of <hi>bearing his Image,</hi> are we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted againe by Holinesse alone. <hi>Be ye holy,</hi> says God, <hi>because I am Holy:</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 16. And <hi>be you perfect,</hi> that is, in doing good, <hi>as your Heavenly Father is perfect,</hi> Math. 5. 48. in a <hi>like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> and conformity to him. and herein is the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed: Ephes. 4. 23, 24. Therein we put on the <hi>new man which after God is created in Righteousnesse, and Holinesse of truth.</hi> This was that which originally was attended with <hi>power</hi> and <hi>domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> is still all that is beautifull or comely in the world; How it makes men <hi>honourable</hi> and <hi>precious</hi> in the sight of <hi>God,</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells,</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> how alone it is that which is not <hi>despised,</hi> which is of <hi>price</hi> before the Lord; what <hi>contempt</hi> and scorne he hath of them in whom it is not, in what Abomination he hath them and all their ways, might easily be evinced;</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Peace,</hi> by it we have <hi>Communion</hi> with God, wherein <hi>Peace</hi> alone is to be enjoyed. The <hi>Wicked are like a troubled Sea, that</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>30</label> 
                  <hi>cannot rest,</hi> and there is <hi>no peace to them saith my God:</hi> Isa. 48. 21. There is no peace, rest, or quietnesse, in a <hi>distance, separation,</hi> or alienation from God. He is the <hi>rest of our soules:</hi> In the light of his Countenance is <hi>life</hi> &amp; <hi>peace:</hi> Now if we walk in the light, as He is light, we have <hi>fellowship one with another,</hi> 1 Ioh 1. 7. and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:60108:109"/>
verily <hi>our fellowship is with the Father, and with the Sonne Jesus Christ:</hi> v. 3. He that walkes in the light <hi>of new obedience,</hi> he hath <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God,</hi> and in his <hi>presence is fullnesse of joy</hi> for ever: without it there is nothing but <hi>darknesse,</hi> and wandring and confusion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Usefullnesse,</hi> A man without <hi>Holinesse</hi> is good for nothing: <hi>Ephraim,</hi> saies the Prophet, <hi>is an empty vine, that brings forth fruit to it selfe.</hi> And what is such a <hi>vine</hi> good for? nothing, saith ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophet, a man cannot make a <hi>pin of it,</hi> so much as to <hi>hang a vessell on:</hi> A barren tree is <hi>good for nothing,</hi> but to be cut downe for the fire. Notwithstanding the seeming <hi>usefullnesse</hi> of men, who serve the <hi>providence</hi> of God in their Generations, I could easily manifest that the <hi>World</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> might want them, and that indeed in themselves they are <hi>good for nothing:</hi> only the <hi>holy</hi> man is <hi>commune bonum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The end of it in <hi>respect of others,</hi> in the world is manifold. 1. It serves to the <hi>Conviction,</hi> and stopping the mouthes of <label type="milestone">

have been overcome by the <hi>constant holy</hi> walking of Professours, and when their day of visitation hath <hi>come,</hi> have <hi>Glorified</hi> God on that account, 1 Pet. 3. 1, 2.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Their cleare and full <hi>conviction</hi> of the necessity of a <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,</hi> wherewith to <hi>appeare</hi> before God. This is alwaies in their thoughts. This in their whole lives they take for <hi>granted.</hi> Many men spend their daies in <hi>obstinacy</hi> and hardnesse, adding <hi>drunkennesse unto thirst,</hi> never once enquiring what their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall be, when they enter into Eternity. Others <hi>trifle</hi> away their <hi>times</hi> and their <hi>soules,</hi> sowing the <hi>wind</hi> of empty hopes, and preparing to reap a <hi>whirlewind</hi> of wrath. But this lies at the bottome of all the <hi>Saints communion</hi> with Christ. A deep fixed, resolved <hi>perswasion,</hi> of an absolute and <hi>indispensable</hi> necessity of a <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> wherewith to <hi>appeare</hi> before God. The <hi>Holinesse</hi> of Gods nature, the <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> of his Goverment, the <hi>severity</hi> of his Law, the <hi>Terrour</hi> of his wrath, are alwaies <hi>before</hi> them. They have been all <hi>convinced</hi> of sinne, and have <hi>looked</hi> on themselves, as ready to sink under the <hi>vengeance</hi> due to it. They have all cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Men and Brethren, what shall we doe to be saved?</hi> Wherewith shall we appeare before God? And have all concluded, that it is in vaine to <hi>flatter</hi> themselves with hopes of escaping as they are by nature; if God be <hi>Holy,</hi> and Righteous, and of <hi>purer eyes then to</hi>

                  <hi>behold iniquity,</hi> they must have a Righteousnesse to stand before him: and they know what will be the cry one day, of those who now <hi>bear up themselves,</hi> as if they were otherwise minded, Isa. 53. 15. Mich. 7. 6, 7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They weigh their own <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> in the ballance, and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>37</label> find it <hi>wanting.</hi> And this two waies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In <hi>Generall,</hi> and upon the whole of the matter, at their first setting themselves before God. When men are convinced of the <hi>necessity</hi> of a <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> they catch at every thing that presents it selfe to them for reliefe. Like men ready to <hi>sinke</hi> in deepe <hi>waters,</hi> catch at that that is next to save them from drowning, which sometimes proves a <hi>rotten stick,</hi> that sinkes with them. So did the Jewes Rom. 9. 31, 32. they caught hold of the <hi>Law,</hi> and it would not relieve them: and how they <hi>peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed</hi> with it, the Apostle declares, Chap. 10. 14. The Law put them upon <hi>setting up a Righteousnesse</hi> of their own; this kept them <hi>doing,</hi> and in hope, but kept them from submitting to the <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> of God. Here many perish, and never get one <hi>step</hi> neerer God all their daies. This the Saints renounce. They have no <hi>confidence in the flesh:</hi> they know that all they <hi>can doe,</hi> all that the <hi>Law can doe,</hi> which is weake through the Flesh, will not <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile them.</hi> See what judgement <hi>Paul</hi> makes of all a mans <hi>own Righteousnesse,</hi> Phil. 3. 8. 10. This they beare in their <hi>minds</hi> dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this they fill their <hi>thoughts</hi> withall, that upon the account of what they <hi>have</hi> done, <hi>can</hi> doe, ever <hi>shall</hi> doe, they cannot be <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted</hi> with God, or justified thereby. This keepes their soules <hi>humble,</hi> full of a <hi>sense</hi> of their own <hi>vilenesse</hi> all their daies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In particular: they dayly <hi>weigh</hi> all their particular Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>38</label> in the ballance, and find them <hi>wanting,</hi> as to any such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatnesse, as upon their own <hi>account</hi> to be accepted with God. Oh! says a Saint, if I had nothing to <hi>commend</hi> me unto God, but this <hi>prayer,</hi> this <hi>duty,</hi> this <hi>conquest</hi> of a Temptation, wherein I my selfe see so many <hi>failings,</hi> so much <hi>imperfection,</hi> could I appeare with any <hi>boldnesse</hi> before him? Shall I then <hi>piece</hi> up a garment of Righteousnesse out of my best <hi>duties;</hi> ah! it is all as a <hi>defiled</hi> cloath, Isa 64. 6. These thoughts accompany them in all their <hi>duties:</hi> in their <hi>best</hi> and most choice <hi>performances.</hi> Lord what am I in my best <hi>estate?</hi> How little suitablenesse unto thy Holinesse is in my best duties?

                  <hi>best</hi> thing

that ever I did in my life. When a man who <hi>lives</hi> up on <hi>convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> hath got some <hi>enlargements</hi> in duties, some <hi>conquest</hi> over a sinne or temptation, he <hi>Huggs</hi> himselfe, like <hi>Micha</hi> when he had got a <hi>Levite</hi> to be his Priest; now surely it shall be <hi>well with him,</hi> now <hi>God will blesse him,</hi> his <hi>heart</hi> is now at ease; he hath peace in what he hath done. But he who has <hi>Communion with Christ,</hi> when he is highest in <hi>duties</hi> of sanctification and <hi>holinesse,</hi> is clearest in the <hi>Apprehension</hi> of his own <hi>unprofitablenesse,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects every thought that might arise in his heart, of setting <hi>his peace</hi> in them, or upon them. He saies to his soule, doe these things seeme <hi>something</hi> to thee? Alas, thou hast to doe with an <hi>infinitely Righteous God,</hi> who lookes through and through all that vanity, which thou art but little <hi>acquainted withall;</hi> and should he deale with thee, according to thy <hi>best</hi> workes, thou must <hi>perish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. They <hi>approve</hi> of, <hi>value</hi> and <hi>rejoyce</hi> in this Righteousnesse, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>39,</label> for their <hi>Acceptation,</hi> which the Lord Jesus hath <hi>wrought</hi> out, and provided for them: this being discovered to them, they <hi>approve</hi> of it with all their <hi>hearts,</hi> and rest in it, Isa. 45. 24. <hi>Surely shall one say, in the Lord have I righteousnesse and strength.</hi> This is their <hi>voyce</hi> and language, when once the Righteousnesse of God in Christ, is made known to them: Here is Righteousnesse <hi>indeed,</hi> here have I rest for my soule. Like the <hi>Merchant man</hi> in the Gospell, Math. 13. 45, 46. that finds the <hi>pearle of price:</hi> I had been searching up and downe, I looked this and that way for helpe, but it was farre away: I spent my <hi>strength for that which was not bread;</hi> here is that <hi>indeed,</hi> which makes me <hi>rich</hi> for ever. When first the Righteousnesse of Christ, for <hi>Acceptation</hi> with God, is revealed to a poore labouring Soul, that hath <hi>sought</hi> for rest and hath found none, he is <hi>surprized</hi> and amazed, and is not able to containe it selfe: and such an one alwaies in his heart <hi>approves</hi> this Righteousnesse on a fivefold account.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>40</label> They see <hi>infinite Wisdome</hi> in this way of their <hi>Acceptation</hi> with God. In what <hi>darknesse,</hi> saies such an one, in what <hi>streights,</hi> in what <hi>intanglements,</hi> was my poor soule? How little able was I to look through the <hi>clouds and perplexities</hi> wherewith I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed? I looked <hi>inwards,</hi> and there was nothing, but <hi>sinne,</hi>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:60108:111"/>
horror, feare, tremblings; I looked <hi>upwards,</hi> and saw nothing but <hi>wrath,</hi> curses and <hi>vengeance;</hi> I knew that God was an <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Righteous</hi> God, and that no <hi>uncleane</hi> thing should abide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; I knew that I was a <hi>poore, vile, uncleane,</hi> and sinfull creature, and how to bring these <hi>two</hi> together in <hi>Peace,</hi> I knew not: but in the <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> of Christ, doth a world of <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> open it <hi>selfe,</hi> dispelling <hi>all difficulties</hi> and darknesse, and manifesting a <hi>Reconciliation of all this.</hi> O the <hi>depth of the riches of the wisdome and knowledge of God!</hi> Rom. 11. 33. and Col. 2. 3. but of this before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As full of <hi>Grace.</hi> He knows that <hi>sinne</hi> had shut up the <hi>whole</hi> way of Grace <hi>towards</hi> him; and whereas God <hi>aymes</hi> at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>41</label> so much as the <hi>manifestation</hi> of his Grace, he was utterly cut short of it. Now to have a <hi>compleat</hi> Righteousnesse provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and yet <hi>abundance</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> manifested, exceedingly delights the soule: to have Gods dealing with his <hi>person,</hi> all <hi>Grace,</hi> and dealing with his <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> all <hi>Justice,</hi> takes up his thoughts. God every where assures us, that this Righteousnesse is of Grace. It is <hi>by Grace, and no more of Workes,</hi> Rom 11. 6. as the Apostle at large sets it out, Ephes. 2. 7, 8, 9. It is from <hi>riches of Grace</hi> and <hi>kindnesse,</hi> that the provision of this Righteousnesse is made: it is of <hi>meere Grace</hi> that it is bestowed on us, it is not at all of workes: Though it be in its selfe, a Righteousnesse of <hi>workes,</hi> yet to us, it is of <hi>meere</hi> Grace. So Tit. 3. 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>But ofter that the kindnesse and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, Not by workes of righteousnesse which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost, Which he shed on us abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour: That being justified by his grace, we should be made heires according to the hope of eternall life.</hi> The rise of all this <hi>dispensation</hi> is <hi>kindnesse</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> that is <hi>Grace,</hi> v. 4. The way of <hi>Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> negatively is not by <hi>workes of Righteousnesse</hi> that we have done; positively, by the <hi>communication of the Holy Ghost,</hi> v. 5. The meanes of whose procurement, is <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> v. 6. And the work it selfe is <hi>by grace,</hi> v. 7. Here is use made of every <hi>word</hi> allmost, whereby the exceeding <hi>rich Grace,</hi> kindnesse, mercy, and goodnesse of God may be expressed, all concurring in this worke.

And this doe the Saints of God in their <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> with Christ, exceedingly rejoyce in before him, that the way of their <hi>Acceptation</hi> before God, is a way of <hi>Grace,</hi> kindnesse and mercy, that they might not <hi>boast</hi> in themselves, but in the <hi>Lord,</hi> and his goodnesse; crying, how great <hi>is thy goodnesse? how great is thy bounty?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. They approve of it, and rejoyce in it, as a way of <hi>great peace</hi> and <hi>security</hi> to themselves and their own soules. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <label type="milestone">

All is quiet and <hi>serene:</hi> not only that <hi>storme</hi> is over, but they are in the <hi>haven</hi> where they would be. They have abiding <hi>peace</hi> with God.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>47</label> of <hi>Acceptation</hi> as that which brings <hi>Glory</hi> to God as such. When they were <hi>labouring</hi> under the guilt of sinne, that which did most of all perplex their <hi>soules</hi> was, that their <hi>safety</hi> was incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the <hi>Glory</hi> and honour of the great God; with his <hi>Justice, Faithfullnesse,</hi> and truth; all which were engaged for the destruction of sinne; and how to come <hi>off</hi> from ruine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 17. 10. 3, 4.</note> the <hi>losse</hi> of their <hi>honour</hi> he saw not. But now by the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Righteousnesse from <hi>Faith,</hi> to <hi>Faith,</hi> they plainly see, that all the <hi>properties</hi> of God are exceedingly glorifyed, in the pardon, Justification, and Acceptance of poor sinners. As before was manifested.</p>
               <p>And this is the first way whereby the Saints hold <hi>daily commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> with the Lord Jesus, in this <hi>purchased Grace</hi> of <hi>Acceptation</hi> with God. They <hi>consider, approve</hi> of, and <hi>rejoyce</hi> in the <hi>way, meanes,</hi> and <hi>thing</hi> it selfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They make an <hi>Actuall commutation</hi> with the Lord Iesus, as to <hi>their</hi> sins and <hi>his</hi> Righteousnesse: of this there are also sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>48</label> parts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They Continually keep alive upon their hearts a sense of the <hi>guilt</hi> &amp; <hi>evill</hi> of sin, even <hi>then</hi> when they are under some <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable</hi> perswasions of their <hi>personall</hi> Acceptance with God. Sense of <hi>pardon</hi> takes away the <hi>horrour</hi> and <hi>feare,</hi> but not a due <hi>sense</hi> of the guilt of sinne. It is the daily <hi>exercise</hi> of the Saints of God, to consider the great provocation that is in <hi>sinne,</hi> their sinnes; the sin of their <hi>nature</hi> and lives: to render themselves <hi>vile</hi> in their own <hi>hearts</hi> and thoughts on that account: to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with the terrour at the Lord: and to judge themselves continually. This they doe in <hi>Generall,</hi> my sin is ever before me, says <hi>David,</hi> They set sinne before them not to <hi>terrify</hi> and <hi>offright</hi> their soules with it, but that a <hi>due sense</hi> of the evill of it, may be kept alive upon their hearts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They gather up in their thoughts the sins for which they <label type="milestone">

                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:60108:114"/>
have not made a <hi>papticular reckoning</hi> with God in Christ: or if they have begun so to doe, yet they have not made cleare worke of it, nor come to a <hi>cleare</hi> and <hi>comfortable</hi> issue. There is nothing more <hi>dreadfull</hi> then for a man to be able to <hi>digest</hi> his convictions: to have sin looke him in the face, and speak per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps some words of terror to him, and to be able by any <hi>charmes</hi> of diversions or delays, to put it off, without comming to a full tryall as to state and condition in reference thereunto. This the <hi>Saints</hi> doe. They gather up their sinnes, lay them in the <hi>ballance</hi> of the Law; see and consider their <hi>weight</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert. And then</p>
               <p n="3">3. They make this <hi>commutation</hi> I speak of with Jesus Christ: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>50</label> that is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They seriously consider, and by Faith <hi>conquer</hi> all objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the contrary, that Jesus Christ by the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>appointment</hi> of the Father, hath really <hi>undergone</hi> the punishment that was due to <hi>those</hi> sinnes, they laye now under his <hi>eye</hi> and consideration. Isa. 53. 6. 2 Cor. 5. 21. He hath as certainly and really an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the <hi>Justice</hi> of God, for them, as if he <hi>himselfe,</hi> the sinner, should at that instant be <hi>cast</hi> into Hell, he could doe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They hearken to the voyce of Christ calling them to <hi>him</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>51</label> with their burden; <hi>come unto me ye that are weary and heavy laden:</hi> come with your burdens: Come thou (poor soule) with thy <hi>guilt</hi> of sinne: why what to doe? why, this is <hi>mine</hi> saith Christ: this Agreement I made with my Father, that I should <hi>come,</hi> and take <hi>thy sinnes,</hi> and <hi>heare</hi> them away: They were my lot. Give me thy <hi>burden,</hi> give me all thy <hi>sinnes;</hi> thou knowest not what to <hi>doe</hi> with them, I know how to dispose of them well enough, so that God shall be glorifyed and thy soule delivered. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,</p>
               <p n="3">3. They lay downe their <hi>sinnes</hi> at the Crosse of Christ, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>52</label> his shoulders; This is Faiths <hi>great and bold</hi> venture upon the Grace, Faithfulnesse and Truth of God. To stand by the <hi>crosse</hi> and say, ah! He is <hi>bruised</hi> for my sinnes, and <hi>wounded for my trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, and the chastisement of my peace is upon him.</hi> He is thus made <hi>sinne</hi> for me. Here I give up my <hi>sinnes</hi> to him that is <hi>able</hi> to beare them, to undergoe them. He requires it of my hands, that I should be <hi>content</hi> that he should undertake for them, and that I <hi>heartily</hi> consent unto. This is <hi>every days</hi> worke. I know
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:60108:114"/>
not how any <hi>peace</hi> can be maintained with God, without it. If it be the work of soules to <hi>receive</hi> Christ, as made <hi>sinne</hi> for us, we must receive him, as <hi>one</hi> that takes our <hi>sinnes</hi> upon him. Not as though he <hi>dyed</hi> any more, or <hi>suffered</hi> any more: but as the faith of the Saints of <hi>old,</hi> made that present, and done before their eyes (not come to passe, Heb. 11. 1.) So faith now, makes that present, which was accomplished and <hi>past</hi> many genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions agoe. This it is to know Christ Crucified.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Having thus by Faith given up their <hi>sinnes</hi> to Christ, &amp; seen God laying them all on him, they draw <hi>nigh,</hi> and take <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>53</label> from him, that <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> which he hath <hi>wrought</hi> out for them: so fulfilling the whole of that of the Apostle, 2 Cor. 5. 21. <hi>He was made sinne for us, that we might become the righteousnesse of God in him.</hi> They consider him tendering himselfe and his <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> to be their Righteousnesse before God: they take it, and accept of it, and compleat this blessed <hi>bartering</hi> and exchange of Faith. Anger, Curse, Wrath, death, sinne as to its guilt, He took it all, and takes it all away; with <hi>him</hi> we leave what ever of this <hi>nature</hi> belongs to us, and from him we <hi>receive,</hi> Love, Life, Righteousnesse and peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But it may be said, surely this <hi>course</hi> of procedure can <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>54</label> never be acceptable to Jesus Christ: What? shall we daily come to him, with our <hi>Filth,</hi> our <hi>Guilt,</hi> our <hi>Sinnes?</hi> may He not, will He not bid us keep them to <hi>our</hi> selves, they are our own; shall we be allwaies <hi>giving</hi> sinnes, and taking Righteousnesse?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There is not <hi>any thing</hi> that Jesus Christ is more <hi>delighted</hi> with, then that his Saints should allwaies <hi>hold communion</hi> with him, as to this businesse of <hi>giving</hi> and <hi>receiving.</hi> For</p>
               <p n="1">1. This exceedingly <hi>honours</hi> him, and gives him the Glory <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>55</label> that is his due; many indeed cry <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> and make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him, but <hi>honour him</hi> not at all. How so? They take his <hi>worke</hi> out of his hands, and ascribe it unto other things; their <hi>Repentance,</hi> their <hi>Duties,</hi> shall beare their iniquities. They doe not <hi>say</hi> so, but they <hi>doe</hi> so. The commutation they make, if they make <hi>any,</hi> it is with themselves. All their <hi>bartering</hi> about sinne, is in and with their own <hi>soules.</hi> The work that Christ <hi>came</hi> to doe in the world, was to <hi>bear our iniquities,</hi> and lay down his life a Ransome for our sinnes. The Cup He had to drink of, was filled with our sinnes, as to the <hi>punishment</hi> due to
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:60108:115"/>
them. What greater <hi>dishonour</hi> then can be done to the <hi>Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> then to ascribe <hi>this work</hi> to any thing else: to think to get <hi>rid</hi> of our sinnes any other <hi>way,</hi> or meanes. Herein, then I say, is Christ <hi>honoured</hi> indeed, when we goe to him with <hi>our sinnes,</hi> by Faith: and say unto him: Lord this is thy <hi>worke:</hi> this is that for which thou <hi>camest into the World;</hi> this is that thou hast <hi>undertaken</hi> to doe; thou callest for my <hi>burthen,</hi> which is too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy <hi>for me to beare:</hi> take it blessed Redeemer: thou tenderest thy <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> that is my portion. Then is Christ <hi>honoured,</hi> then is the Glory of <hi>Mediation</hi> ascribed to him, when we walke with him in this <hi>Communion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This exceedingly <hi>endeares</hi> the soules of the Saints to him, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>56</label> and constraines them to put a due <hi>valuation</hi> upon him, his <hi>Love,</hi> his Righteousnesse and Grace. When they <hi>find,</hi> and have the <hi>daily</hi> use of it, then they do it. Who would not <hi>love him:</hi> I have been with the <hi>Lord Jesus,</hi> may the <hi>poore soule</hi> say: I have <hi>left</hi> my sins, my by <hi>burthen</hi> with him, and he hath given me his <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> wherewith I am going with <hi>boldnesse</hi> to God. I was <hi>dead,</hi> and am <hi>alive,</hi> for He <hi>dyed</hi> for me; I was <hi>cursed,</hi> and am <hi>blessed,</hi> for He was made a <hi>curse</hi> for me; I was <hi>troubled,</hi> but have <hi>peace,</hi> for the <hi>chastisement of my peace</hi> was upon him; I knew not what to <hi>doe,</hi> nor whither to cause my <hi>sorrow</hi> to goe; by him have I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved joy <hi>unspeakable</hi> and Glorious: if <hi>I</hi> doe not <hi>love</hi> him, <hi>delight</hi> in him, <hi>obey</hi> him, <hi>live</hi> to him, <hi>dye</hi> for him, I am worse then the <hi>Devills</hi> in hell. Now the great ayme of Christ in the world, is, to have an <hi>high place</hi> and esteeme in the <hi>hearts</hi> of his people: to have there, (as He hath in himselfe,) the <hi>preheminence</hi> in all things; not to be justled up and downe <hi>among</hi> other things: to be all, and in all. And thus are the Saints of God prepared to esteeme him, upon the engaging themselves to this <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Yea, but you will say, if this be so, what need we to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I judge no mans <hi>person:</hi> but this I must needs say, that I doe not understand, how a man that <hi>makes this objection in cold blood,</hi> not under a <hi>temptation</hi> or accidentall darknesse, can have any <hi>true</hi> or reall <hi>acquaintance</hi> with Jesus Christ: however this I
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:60108:115"/>
am <hi>certaine</hi> of, that this Communion in <hi>its selfe,</hi> produces quite other effects, then those supposed. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. For Repentance; it is I suppose, a <hi>Gospell Repentance</hi> that <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>58</label> is intended. For a Legall bondage Repentance full of dread, <hi>amazement, terrour,</hi> selfe-love, astonishment at the presence of God, I confesse this <hi>Communion</hi> takes it away, <hi>prevents</hi> it, casts it out, with its <hi>bondage</hi> and feare: But for <hi>Gospell Repentance,</hi> whose nature consists in <hi>Godly sorrow for sinne,</hi> with its <hi>relinquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> proceeding from <hi>Faith, Love,</hi> and <hi>Abhorrency</hi> of sinne, on accounts of <hi>Father, Son, and Spirit,</hi> both <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> that this should be hindered by this Communion, is not possible. I told you that the <hi>Foundation</hi> of this Communion, is <hi>laid in a deep,</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, daily consideration of <hi>sinne,</hi> its guilt, <hi>vilenesse</hi> and <hi>abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> and our own <hi>vilenesse</hi> on that account. That a sense <hi>hereof</hi> is to be kept <hi>alive</hi> in and upon the heart of every <hi>one,</hi> that will enjoy this <hi>Communion</hi> with Christ: without it Christ is of no value, nor esteeme to him. Now is it <hi>possible</hi> that a man should dayly <hi>fill his heart,</hi> with the thoughts of the <hi>vilenesse</hi> of sinne, on all considerations what ever, of <hi>Law, Love, Grace, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell,</hi> life and death, and be filled with selfe abhorrency on this account, and yet be a <hi>stranger to Godly sorrow?</hi> Here is the mistake, the Foundation of this <hi>Communion,</hi> is laid in that, which they suppose it <hi>overthrowes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But what shall we say for <hi>obedience:</hi> if Christ be so <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>59</label> and <hi>honoured</hi> by taking our sinnes, the more we <hi>bring to him</hi> the more will he be glorified. A man could not suppose that this <hi>Objection</hi> would be <hi>made,</hi> but that the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> who knows what is in man, and his heart, hath <hi>made it for them,</hi> and in their name, Rom. 6. 1, 2, 3. The very same <hi>Doctrine</hi> that I have insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted on, being delivered Chap. 5. 18, 19, 20. The same <hi>objection</hi> is made to it; and for those who think it may have any <hi>weight,</hi> I referre them to the Answer given in that Chapter by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, as also to what was said before to the <hi>necessity</hi> of our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, notwithstanding the <hi>Imputation</hi> of the Righteousnes of Christ.</p>
               <p>But you will say: How should we <hi>addresse our selves</hi> to the performance of this duty: what path are we to walk in? <label type="milestone">

He promiseth his Disciples, that he will pursue the <hi>worke</hi> which he hath in hand in their behalfe, and <hi>intercede</hi> with the Father for the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as a fruit of his purchase. Therefore He tells them, <hi>that He will not pray the Father for his Love</hi> unto them,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:60108:117"/>
because the Eternall Love of the Father, is not the <hi>Fruit,</hi> but the <hi>Fountaine</hi> of his Purchase: but the Spirit that is a Fruit, that (saith He) <hi>I will pray the Father for &amp;c.</hi> And what Christ as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Father as Mediator, to bestow on us, that is part of his <hi>Purchase</hi>

And this is the First thing that is to be considered in the Lord Jesus, as to the <hi>communication</hi> of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Sanctification and purification; (the First thing to be considered in this our Communion with him) He <hi>intercedes</hi> with his Father, that he may be bestowed on us, as a Fruit of his Death and Bloodshed in our behalfe. This is the Relation of the <hi>Spirit of Holinesse</hi> as bestowed on us, unto the Mediation of Christ. He is the great <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 3. 15. Isa. 42. 6. 49 8. Dan. 9. 24.</note> foundation of the <hi>covenant of Grace;</hi> being himselfe everlastingly <hi>destinated,</hi> and freely given to make a <hi>purchase</hi> of all the good things thereof. Receiving according to promise the Holy Ghost, Acts 2. 33. he sheds him abroad on his own. This Faith considers, fixes on, dwells upon. For 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> His Prayer being granted <hi>(as the Father allwaies hears him)</hi> He actually sends his <hi>Spirit</hi> into the Hearts of his Saints, there to dwell in his <hi>stead,</hi> and to doe all things <hi>for</hi> them, and <note place="margin">Joh. 11. 42.</note> 
                  <hi>in</hi> them, which He himselfe hath to doe. This Secondly is the Lord Christ by Faith to be Eyed in: and that not only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the first <hi>enduing</hi> of our hearts with his Holy Spirit, but also of the continuall <hi>supplies</hi> of it, drawing forth, and exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">Vicariam na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vare operam. <hi>Tertull.</hi> Prov. 1. 23.</note> more effectuall <hi>Operations</hi> and Actings of that indwelling Spirit. Hence, though Ioh. 14. 16.

So Chapt. 16. 7. <hi>I will send him:</hi> and v. 14 15. He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifests <hi>how</hi> he will send him, He will furnish him with that which <hi>is his,</hi> to bestow upon them: <hi>He shall take of mine</hi> (of that which is properly and peculiarly <hi>so, mine</hi> as <hi>Mediatour,</hi> the fruit of my Life and Death unto Holinesse) <hi>and give it unto you.</hi> but of these things more afterwards. This then is the Second thing
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:60108:117"/>
that the Lord Christ <hi>doth,</hi> and which is to be <hi>eyed</hi> in him, he sends his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> into our Hearts, which is the <hi>efficient</hi> cause <note place="margin">Titus 3. 56.</note> of all Holinesse and Sanctification, quickening, enlightning, purifying the Soules of his Saints. How our <hi>union</hi> with him, with all the benefits thereon depending, floweth from this his communication of the <hi>spirit</hi> unto us, to <hi>abide</hi> with us, and to <hi>dwell</hi> in us, I have at large elsewhere declared: where also this <note place="margin">Saints Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, cap. 8. p. 189.</note> whole matter is more fully opened.

Now it differs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the <hi>Spirit dwelling</hi> in the Saints? for it is a <hi>created Quality.</hi> The Spirit dwells in us as a <hi>Free Agent</hi> in an Holy <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>6</label> Habitation.

                  <hi>Actuall Grace is an Elapse of Divine Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Assistance, working in and by the Soul, any Spirituall Act or Duty whatsoever, without any praeexistence unto that Act or Continuance after it,</hi> God working in us, both to <hi>will</hi> and to <hi>doe.</hi> But this <hi>Habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi> Grace is alwaies <hi>resident</hi> in us, causing the soule to be a <hi>meet principle</hi> for all those holy and Spirituall opperations, which by Actuall Grace are to be performed.

               <p>These things being <hi>premised,</hi> as to the nature of it: Let us <label type="milestone">

               <p n="1">1. As I said of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> so (in the first place) I say of this, it is of the <hi>Purchase</hi> of Christ, and is so to be <hi>looked</hi> on. <hi>It is given unto us, for his sake to believe on him:</hi> Phil. 1. 29.

Oblation and Intercession Iye at the bottome of this dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Were not Grace by them procured, it would never by any one soule be enjoyed. All Grace is from this fountaine. In our receiving it from Christ, we must still consider what it cost him; want of this weakens faith in its proper workings: <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 32.</note> His whole intercession is founded on his <hi>Oblation:</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 1, 2. What he purchased by his Death, that (nor more, nor lesse as hath been often said) He <hi>intercedeth</hi> may be bestowed. And he prays that all his <hi>Saints</hi> may have this Grace whereof we speake, Joh. 17. 17. Did we continually consider all Grace as the fruit of the <hi>Purchase</hi> of Christ, it would be an exceeding <hi>Endearement</hi> on our Spirits. Nor can we without this <hi>considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> according to the tenor of the Gospell, aske or exspect any <hi>Grace.</hi> It is no prejudice to the free Grace of the <hi>Father,</hi> to look on any thing as the purchase of the <hi>Son.</hi> It was from that <hi>Grace,</hi> that he made that Purchase. And in the Receiving of Grace from God, we have not Communion with Christ, who is yet the <hi>treasury</hi> and store house of it; unlesse we look upon it as his <hi>purchase.</hi> He hath obtained that we should be <hi>sanctifyed</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 25, 26, 27. Tit. 2. 14. Rom. 6. 4.</note> through out, have <hi>life</hi> in us, be humble, <hi>holy,</hi> believing, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the spoyle with the mighty, by destroying the workes of the <hi>Divell</hi> in us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord Christ doth <hi>Actually Communicate</hi> this Grace unto his Saints, and bestows it on them. <hi>Of his fullnesse we have all received, and Grace for Grace,</hi> Joh. 1. 16. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Father actually <hi>invests him</hi> with all the Grace, whereof by <hi>Compact</hi> and Agreement, he hath made a <hi>purchase</hi> (as he received the promise of the Spirit) which is all that is of use for the bringing his many Sonnes to Glory. <hi>It pleased the Father, that in him all fullnesse should dwell.</hi> Col. 1. 17. That he should be invested with a Fullnesse of that grace which is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for his People. This himselfe calls the <hi>Power of giving Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Life to his Elect:</hi> John 17. 2. Which power is not only his <hi>Abilitie</hi> to doe it, but also his <hi>Right</hi> to doe it. Hence this Delivering of <hi>all things</hi> unto him by his Father, he lays as the bottome of his inviting sinners unto him for Refreshment. <hi>All things are delivered unto me of my Father</hi> Math. 11. 37. <hi>Come unto me all that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you Rest</hi> v. 28.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:60108:119"/>
This being the Covenant of the Father with him, and his <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise unto him,</hi> that upon the making his soule <hi>an Offering for sinne, He should see his seed, and the pleasure of the Lord should prosper in his hand:</hi> Isa. 53. 10. and in the verses following, the <hi>powring out of his soul vnto death, and bearing the sinnes of many,</hi> is laid as the bottome and procuring cause of these things. 1. of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>by his knowledge he shall justify many.</hi> 2. Of Sanctification; in <hi>destroying</hi> the workes of the Divell: v. 11. 12. Thus comes our mercifull <hi>High Priest</hi> to be the great possessor of all <hi>Grace,</hi> that he may give out to us according to his own pleasure; <hi>quickning</hi> whom he will. He hath it in him really as our <hi>Head,</hi> in that he received not that spirit by <hi>measure</hi> Joh. 3. 34. which is the bond of <hi>Union</hi> between him and us, 1 Cor. 6. 17. whereby holding him the <hi>Head,</hi> we are filled with his <hi>fullnesse</hi> Ephes. 1. 22 23. Col. 2. 19. He hath it as a Common person intrusted with it on our behalfe: Rom. 5. 14, 15, 16, 17. The <hi>last Adam is made unto us a quickning spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 45. He is also a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury of this Grace in a <hi>morall</hi> and law sense; not only as it pleased the Father, that all <hi>fullnesse should dwell in him,</hi> Col. 1. 19. but also because in his <hi>mediation,</hi> as hath been declared, is founded the whole <hi>dispensation</hi> of Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Being thus actually vested with this power and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and fullnesse, He designes the spirit to take of this <hi>full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> and to give it unto us. <hi>He shall take of mine and shew it unto you;</hi> Joh. 16. 15. The Spirit takes of that <hi>Fullnesse</hi> that is in Christ, and in the Name of the Lord Jesus, bestows it <hi>actually</hi> on them, for whose Sanctification He is sent. Concerning the manner and Allmighty efficacy of the Spirit of Grace, whereby this is done (I meane, this actuall Collation of Grace upon his <hi>peculiar</hi> ones) more will be spoken afterwards.</p>

               <p>In the <hi>First sence,</hi> as to the <hi>reall</hi> Communicating of the <hi>Spirit of Grace</hi> unto the Soul, so raising it from <hi>Death</hi> unto <hi>Life,</hi> the Saints have no kind of <hi>Communion</hi> with Christ therein, but only what consists in a <hi>passive Reception</hi> of that life-giving, quickening Spirit and power. They are but as the <hi>dead bones</hi> in the Prophet, the wind blows on them, and they live: as <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> in the Grave, Christ calls and they come forth; the call being accompained with <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>power.</hi> This then is not that whereof particularly I speake.

               <p n="1">1. In the preparation unto the dispensation mentioned, in the <hi>Expiating, Parging, Purifying</hi> Efficacy of his Blood, It was a Sacrifice not only of <hi>Attonement</hi> as <hi>offered,</hi> but also of <hi>purification,</hi> as powred out.

                  </gap> a <hi>sprinkling of blood,</hi> without which there is no actuall <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification.</hi> This the Apostle largely describes: Heb. 9. <hi>When Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> (saith he) <hi>had spoken every precept to the People according to the Law, he tooke the blood of Calves and of Goats, with water, and scarlet wooll, &amp; Hyssop, &amp; sprinkled both the book and all the People, saying, this is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoyned unto you: More over, he sprinkled with blood, both the Tabernacle, &amp; all the Vessells of the Ministry; and allmost all things are by the Law purged with blood: It was therefore necessary that the patternes of the things in the Heavens, should be purifyed with these, but the Heavenly things themselves, with better Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices then these</hi> v. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. He had formerly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Blood of Christ, to the blood of Sacrifices as offered in respect of the <hi>impetration</hi> and the <hi>Purchase</hi> it made; now he doth it unto that <hi>blood</hi> as sprinkled, in respect of its <hi>Aplication</hi> unto purification and holinesse. And he tells us how this <hi>sprinkling</hi> was performed, it was by <hi>dipping Hyssop</hi> in the blood of the Sacrifice, and so dashing it out upon the <hi>things</hi> and persons to be purifyed. As the <hi>Institution</hi> also was with the <hi>Paschall</hi> Lamb: Exod. 12. 12. Hence <hi>David</hi> in a sence of the pollution of sin prays, that he may be <hi>purged with Hyssop:</hi> Ps. 51. 7. For that this peculiarly respected the <hi>Uncleannesse</hi> and Defilement of sin, is evident, because there is no mention made in the <hi>Institution</hi> of any Sacrifice, (after that of the <hi>Lamb</hi> before mentioned,) of sprinkling blood with <hi>Hyssop,</hi> but only in those which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected <hi>purification</hi> of uncleannesse. As in the case of <hi>Leprosy,</hi> Levit. 14. 6. and all other defilements Numb. 19. 18. which latter indeed, is not of blood but of the water of separation, this also being eminently Typpicall of the blood of Christ, which is the <hi>Fountaine for separation for Uncleannesse.</hi> Zech. 13. 1. Now this <hi>branch</hi> of Hyssop wherein the blood of purification was prepared for the sprinkling of the uncleane, is, (unto us) the free promises of Christ. The cleasing vertue of the Blood of Christ lyes in the Promises, as the blood of Sacrifices in the <hi>Hyssop,</hi> ready to passe out unto them that draw <hi>nigh</hi> thereunto. Therefore the Apostle argueth from receiving of the <hi>Promises</hi>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:60108:121"/>
unto Universall <hi>Holinesse</hi> and purity. <hi>Having therefore these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises (Dearely Beloved) let us cleanse our selves from all filthinesse of flesh and Spirit, perfecting Holinesse in the feare of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 1. This then the Saints doe; they eye the Blood of Christ as it is in the Promise, ready to <hi>issue</hi> out upon the <hi>Soule</hi> for the purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation thereof: and thence is purging and cleansing vertue to be communicated unto them, and by the <hi>blood</hi> of Christ are they to be purged from all their sinnes, Joh. 1. 7. Thus farre as it were, this <hi>Purifying blood</hi> thus prepared and made ready is at some distance to the soule. Though it be shed to this <hi>purpose,</hi> that it might purge, cleanse, and Sanctify, though it be taken up with the bunch of Hyssop in the Promises, yet the soul may not partake of it: wherefore</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THe third-thing wherein we have communion with Christ is Grace of <hi>Priviledge</hi> before God: I meane as <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>1</label> the <hi>third head</hi> of purchased Grace. The <hi>priviledges</hi> we enjoy by Christ, are great and innumerable. To insist on them in particular, were work for a mans whole life, not a designe to be wrapped up in a <hi>few sheets.</hi> I shall take a view of them only in the Head, the spring and Fountain whence they all arise and flow. <hi>This is our Adoption.</hi> Beloved, <hi>now we are the Sons of God.</hi> 1 Ioh. 3. 2. This is our great and fountain privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Whence is it that we are so? it is from the Love of the Father, v. 1. <hi>Behold, what love the Father hath given unto us, that we should be called the sons of God.</hi> But by whom immediatly doe we receive this honour? <hi>As many as believe on Christ, he gives them this power to become the Sons of God,</hi> Ioh. 1. 12. Himselfe was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be the <hi>first borne</hi> among many brethren, Rom: 8. 29. and his taking us to be <hi>brethren,</hi> Heb. 2. 11. makes us become <hi>the Children of God.</hi> Now that God is our Father, by being the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of Christ, and we his <hi>children,</hi> by being the brethren of Christ, being the head and summe of all the honour, priviledge, right, and Title we have, let us a little consider the nature of that <hi>act,</hi> whereby we are invested with this state and title; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our Adaption.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now Adoption is the Authorative translation of a Believer by Jesus</hi>

                  <hi>Christ from the family of the world and Satan, into the family of God, with his investiture in all the priviledges, and advantages of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the compleat <hi>Adoption</hi> of any person, these five things rre required. <label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That he be <hi>actually,</hi> and of his own right, of another fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, then that whereunto he is adopted. He must be the <hi>son</hi> of one <hi>family</hi> or other in his own right, as all persons are.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:60108:122"/>
2. That there be a <hi>Family</hi> unto which of himselfe he hath no right, whereinto he is to be grafted. If a man comes into a family upon a <hi>personall right,</hi> though originally at never so great a distance, that man is not adopted. If a man of a most remote consanguinity, doe come into the inheritance of any <hi>family</hi> by the <hi>death</hi> of the neerer heires, though his right before were little better <hi>then nothing,</hi> yet he is a <hi>borne son</hi> of that Family, he is not adopted. He is not to have the plea of the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote <hi>possibility</hi> of succession.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That there be an <hi>Authoritative legall translation</hi> of him, by some that have power thereunto, from one family into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It was not by the <hi>Law</hi> of old, in the power of particular persons, to adopt when, and whom they would. It was to be done by the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Soveraigne power.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the adopted person be freed from all the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that be upon him unto the family, from whence he is translated: otherwise he can be no way usefull, or serviceable unto the <hi>family,</hi> whereinto he is engrafted: He cannot serve two <hi>masters,</hi> much lesse two <hi>Fathers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. That by vertue of his Adoption, he be invested in all the rights, <hi>Priviledges,</hi> Advantages, and <hi>Title</hi> to the whole inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the family into which he is adopted, in as full and ample manner, as if he had been <hi>borne</hi> a son therein.</p>
               <p>Now all these things and Circumstances doe concurre, and are found in the <hi>Adoption</hi> of believers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are by their own <hi>originall right</hi> of another family, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>4</label> then that whereinto they are adopted. They are by Nature the children <hi>of wrath,</hi> Eph. 2. 3. Sons of wrath: of that family whose inheritance is <hi>wrath;</hi> called the power of darknesse, Col. 1. 13. For from thence doth God <hi>translate them into the Kingdome of his deare Son.</hi> This is the family of the world and of Sathan, of which by nature believers are. What ever is to be <hi>inherited</hi> in that family; as wrath, curse, death, Hell, they have a right thereunto. Neither can they <hi>of</hi> themselves, or <hi>by</hi> themselves get free of this family: a strong man armed, keeps them in subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Their naturall estate is a <hi>family condition,</hi> attended with all circumstances of a family; family duties and services; rights and titles; Relations, and observances. They are of the black family of sinne, and Satan.</p>

2. There is <hi>another</hi> family <hi>whereinto</hi> they are to be translated, <label type="milestone">

This is that <hi>family</hi> in heaven and earth, which is called <hi>after the name of Christ.</hi> Eph. 3. v. 15. The great family of God: God hath an <hi>house,</hi> and family for his children, of whom, some he <hi>maintaines</hi> on the riches of his grace, and some he <hi>entertaines</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 6.</note> with the fullnesse of his glory. This is that <hi>house</hi> whereof the Lord Christ is the great dispenser, It having pleased the Father <hi>to gather in one all things in him, both which are in heaven, and which are in earth, even in him</hi> Ephes 1. v. 10. Herein live all the Sons and daughters of God, spending largely on the Riches of his Grace. Unto this family of themselves they have no <hi>right,</hi> nor Title: they are wholly alienated from it. Eph. 2. 12. and can lay no clayme to any thing in it. God driving fallen <hi>Adam</hi> out of the Garden, and shutting up all wayes of <hi>Returne</hi> with a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming sword ready to cut him off, if he should attempt it; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly declares that he, and all in him, had lost all right of approaching unto God, in any family relation. Corrupted, cursed nature is not vested with the least right to any thing of God: therefore</p>
               <p>They have an <hi>Authoritative translation</hi> from one of these fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>6</label> to another. It is not done in a <hi>private</hi> underhand-way, but in the way of Authority. Ioh: 1, 12. to as many as recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, he <hi>gave power to become the sons of God.</hi> Power, or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. This investing them with the power, excellency, and right of the Sons of God, is a <hi>forensicall act,</hi> and hath a legall proceeding in it. It is called the <hi>making us meet</hi> for the <hi>inheritance of the Saints in light,</hi> Col. 1. v. 12. A <hi>Judiciall exalting</hi> us into <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 29.

               <p>Now this <hi>Authoritative translation</hi> of Believers from one fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into another, consisteth of these two parts. <label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. An <hi>effectuall Proclamation</hi> and declaration of such a persons immunity from all Obligations to the former family, to which by Nature he was <hi>related,</hi> And this declaration hath a threefold object.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Angells:</hi> It is declared un to <hi>them,</hi> they are the Sons of

               <p n="1">1. Generally by the doctrine of the Gospell, Eph. 3. 10. <hi>Unto the principalities, and powers in heavenly places is made known by the Church, the manifold wisdome of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. By the Church is this wisdome made known to the Angells: either as the doctrine of the <hi>Gospell</hi> is delivered unto it, or as it is gathered thereby. And what is this Wisdome of God, that is thus made known to principalities and powers? It is that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> should be fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-heirs, and of the same body with us, v. 6. The mystery of Adopting sinners of the Gentiles, taking them from their slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the family of the World, that they might have a right of <hi>heirship,</hi> becoming Sons in the family of God, is this wise. dome thus made known. And how was it primitively made known? It was <hi>revealed by the spirit unto the Prophets and Apostles,</hi> v. 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In Particular by <hi>Immediate Revelation.</hi> When any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar soule is <hi>freed</hi> from the family of this World, it is revealed to the Angells. There <hi>is joy in the presence of the Angells of God</hi> (that is among the Angells, and by them) <hi>over one sinner that Repenteth,</hi> Luke 15. v. 10. Now the Angells cannot of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves absolutely know <hi>the true Repentance</hi> of a sinner in it selfe. It is a <hi>work</hi> wrought in that Cabinet, which none hath a <hi>key</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to but Jesus Christ: by him it is revealed to the <hi>Angells,</hi> when the peculiar care, and charge of such an one is committed to them. These things have their transaction before the Angels, Luk. 12. v. 8, 9. Christ ownes the names of his brethren before the Angells; Revel. 2. 5. when he gives them admittance into the family where they are, Heb. 12. 22. he declares to them that they are <hi>Sons,</hi> that they may discharge their duty towards them; Heb. 1. last.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is denounced in a judiciall way unto <hi>Satan,</hi> the great <label type="milestone">

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:60108:124"/>
the Lord Christ delivers a soule from under the power of <hi>that strong armed one,</hi> he binds him: tyes him from the exercise of that power and dominion which before he had over him. And by this meanes doth he know that such an one is delivered from his family; and all his future attempts upon him, are <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachings</hi> upon the possession, and inheritance of the Lord Christ.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Unto the <hi>Conscience of the Person</hi> adopted. The spirit of Christ testifies to the heart and Conscience of a Believer, that he is freed from all engagements unto the family of Satan, and is become the <hi>Son of God,</hi> Rom. 8. 14, 15. and enables him to cry <hi>Abba Father,</hi> Gal. 4. 6. Of the Particulars of this testificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and of its absolving the soule from its old al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, I shall speak afterward. And herein consists the first thing mentioned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is an <hi>Authoritative engrafting</hi> of a Believer actually <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>9</label> into the family of God, and investing him with the whole right of Sonship. Now this, as unto us, hath sundry acts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The giving a believer a <hi>new name</hi> in a white stone, Revel. 1. 17. they that are <hi>adopted</hi> are to take new names: They change their names they had in their old <hi>families,</hi> to take the names of the families whereinto they are translated. This <hi>new name</hi> is, A Child of God: that is the <hi>new name</hi> given in adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and no man knoweth what is in that name, but only he that doth receive it. And this <hi>new name</hi> is given, and written in a white stone; that is the <hi>Tessera</hi> of our admission into the house of God. It is a stone of judiciall acquitment. Our adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the spirit is bottomed on our <hi>Absolution</hi> in the blood of Jesus: and therefore is the <hi>new name,</hi> in the <hi>white</hi> stone; privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge grounded on discharge. The white <hi>stone</hi> quits the claime of the old family; The new name gives <hi>entrance</hi> to the other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An enrolling of his name in the Catalogue of the <hi>houshold</hi> of God. Admitting him thereby, into <hi>fellowship</hi> therein. This is called the <hi>writing of the house of Israel,</hi> Ezek. 13. 9. that is the <hi>roll,</hi> wherein all the names of the Israel, the family of God are written. God hath a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of his houshold; Christ knows his <hi>sheep</hi> by name. When God writeth up the people, he counts that this man was borne in Sion, Ps. 87. 6. This is an extract of the <hi>Lambs</hi> book of life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:60108:124"/>
3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> Testifying to his Conscience, <hi>his Acceptation</hi> with God, enableing him to behave himselfe as a <hi>child,</hi> Rom. 8. 15. Gal. 4. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>The two <hi>last</hi> things required to Adoption are, that the <hi>adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted person</hi> be freed from all <hi>Obligations</hi> to the family from <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>10</label> whence he is translated, and invested with the <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi> of that whereunto he is translated. Now because these two comprize the whole <hi>issue</hi> of Adoption, wherein the Saints have <hi>Communion</hi> with Christ. I shall handle them together, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the concernments of them unto these foure heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Liberty:</hi> 2. <hi>Title,</hi> or right: 3. <hi>Boldnesse:</hi> 4. <hi>Correction.</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>11</label> These are the four things in reference to the <hi>family</hi> of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted person, that he doth receive by his Adoption, wherein he holds communion with the Lord Jesus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Liberty:</hi> The spirit of the Lord, that was upon the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> did anoint him to proclaime <hi>liberty</hi> to the captive: Esay: 67. 1. And where the <hi>spirit of God is, (that is the spirit of</hi> Christ given to us by him because we are Sons) <hi>there is Liberty:</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 17. All spirituall <hi>liberty</hi> is from the spirit of Adoption. What ever else is pretended, is licentiousnesse. So the Apostle argues, Gal. 4. 6, 7. <hi>he hath sent forth his spirit into their hearts cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Abba Father, wherefore ye are no more Servants,</hi> no more in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, but have the liberty of Sons; And this <hi>Liberty</hi> respects in the first place, the family from whence the adopted person is translated; it is his setting free from all the obligations of that family.</p>
               <p>Now in this sense, the liberty which the Saints have by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>12</label> is either from that which is <hi>reall,</hi> or that which is <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended;</hi> that which is <hi>reall</hi> respects a twofold issue of Law, and Sinne. The morall unchangeable Law of God, and Sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in conjunction, meeting with reference to any persons, hath, and hath had a twofold issue;</p>
               <p n="1">1. An <hi>Oeconomicall</hi> institution of a new Law of Ordinances, keeping in bondage those to whom it was given, Col. 2. 14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Naturall (if I may so call it) pressing off those <hi>persons</hi> with its power and efficacy against sin, whereof there are these parts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Its <hi>rigor,</hi> and terror in commanding.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:60108:125"/>
2. Its <hi>Impossibility</hi> for accomplishment, and so insufficiency for its primitively appointed end.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Issues</hi> of its transgression, which are referred unto two heads: 1. Curse: 2. Death. I shall speak very briefly of these, because they are commonly handled, and granted by all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That which is pretended, is the power of any whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>13</label> over the <hi>conscience,</hi> when once made free by Christ.</p>
               <p>First then, Believers are freed from the <hi>instituted Law of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> which upon the testimony of the Apostles, was a yoke <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>14</label> which <hi>neither we nor our Fathers</hi> (in the faith) could beare, Acts 15. 10. Wherefore Christ blotted out this <hi>hand writing of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> that was against them, which was <hi>contrary to them, and took it out of the way, nayling it to his Crosse:</hi> Col: 2. 14. and thereupon the Apostle after a long dispute concerning the Liberty that we have from that Law, concludes with this instruction, Gal. 5. 1. <hi>stand fast in the Liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In reference to the <hi>Morall</hi> Law! the first thing we have liberty from, is its <hi>rigor,</hi> and terror in commanding, Heb. 12 <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>15</label> 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>We are not come to the Mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, to the whirle-wind, darknesse, and tempest, to the sound of the trumpet, and the voice of words, which they that heard besought that they might heare it no more; But we are come to mount Sion &amp;c.</hi> As to that administration of the Law wherein it was given out with dread, and terror, and so exacted its obedience with rigor, we are <hi>freed</hi> from it, we are not called to that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Its <hi>Impossibility</hi> of accomplishment, and so insufficiency <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>16</label> for its primitive End by reason of sin. Or we are freed from the Law as the instrument of Righteousnesse, since by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility of its fulfilling as to us, it is become insufficient for any such purpose. Rom. 8. 2, 3. Gal. 3. 21, 22, 23. There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>impossibility</hi> of obtaining life by the Law, we are exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from it as to any such end, and that by the righteousnesse of Christ, Rom. 8. 3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From the <hi>Issue of its transgression.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>17</label> 
                  <hi>Curse.</hi> There is a solemne curse enwrapping the whole <hi>wrath</hi> of Cod, annexed to the Law, with reference to the transgression thereof: and from this are we wholly at <hi>liberty,</hi>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:60108:125"/>
Gal: 3. 13. By <hi>being made a curse, he hath delivered us from the curse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Death:</hi> Heb: 2. 14, 15. and therewith from Satan; Heb. 2. 15. Col. 1. 13. and Sin, Rom. 6. 14. 1 Pet. 1. 18. with the World, Gal. 1. 14. with all the attendances, advantages, and claime of them all, Gal. 4 3, 4, 5. Col. 2. 20. without which we could not live one day.</p>
               <p>That which is pretended, and claimed by some, wherein in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>18</label> and in truth we were never in bondage, but are hereby eminently set free, is the power of <hi>binding Conscience</hi> by any Lawes and constitutions, not from God, Col. 2. 20. 21 22.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>Liberty in</hi> the family of God, as well as a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>19</label> 
                  <hi>from</hi> the family of Satan; Sons are free: their obedience is a <hi>free</hi> obedience, They have the spirit of the Lord, and where he is, <hi>there is Liberty:</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18. as a spirit of Adoption he is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the spirit of bondage, Rom: 8. 15. Now this liberty of our fathers family, which we have as <hi>Sons</hi> and children, being adopted by Christ through the spirit, is; a <hi>spirituall large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart, whereby the children of God do freely, willingly, genuinely, without feare, terror, bondage, and constraint go forth unto all holy obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I say this is our Liberty in our Fathers family; what we have liberty from, hath been already declared.</p>
               <p>There be <hi>Gibeonites</hi> outwardly attending the family of God: that doe the <hi>service</hi> of his house, as the <hi>drudgery</hi> of their lives; the principle they yeeld obedience upon, is a <hi>spirit of bondage</hi> unto feare, Rom. 8. 15. the <hi>Rule</hi> they doe it by, is the <hi>Law</hi> in its dread and rigor, exacting it of them to the utmost, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy and mitigation; the <hi>End</hi> they doe it for, is to fly from the wrath to come, to Pacify conscience, and seek righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse as it were by the workes of the Law. Thus servilely, painfully, fruitlessely, they seek to <hi>serve</hi> their own conviction all their daies.</p>
               <p>The Saints, by Adoption have <hi>a largenesse</hi> of heart in all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obedience, saith <hi>David, I will walk at liberty, for I seek thy precepts,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>20</label> Psal. 119. 4, 5. Esay 61. 1 Luke 4 18. Rom 8. 2, 21. Gal. 4. 2. 5. 1, 13. Iames 1. 25. Ioh. 8. 32, 33, 36. Rom. 6. 18. 1 Pet. 2. 16. Now this <hi>Amplitude,</hi> or Son-like freedome of the spirit in obedience, consists in sundry things.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:60108:126"/>
1. In the Principles of all spirituall service, which are <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Love:</hi> The one respecting the <hi>matter</hi> of their obedience, giveing them power, the other respecting the <hi>manner</hi> of their obedience giving them <hi>Joy,</hi> and sweetnesse in it. It is from <hi>Life,</hi> that gives them power as to the matter of obedience, Rom. 8.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Law of the <hi>spirit of Life in Christ Jesus, sets them free from the law of sin and death:</hi> it frees them, it carries them out to all obedience freely. So that they walk after the <hi>Spirit,</hi> v. 1. that being the <hi>Principle</hi> of their workings, G. 2. 20. <hi>Christ lives in me, and the life which I now live in the flesh, is by the faith of the Son of God:</hi> the <hi>life</hi> which I now live in the fiesh, that is the obedience which I yeeld unto God, whilest I am in the <hi>flesh,</hi> it is from a <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> of life, Christ living in me: There is then power for all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unto God, from Christ in them, the spirit of life, from Christ carrying them out thereto. The fruits of a dead root, are but dead excrescencies; living Acts are from a principle of life.</p>
               <p>Hence you may see the difference between the liberty that <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>21</label> 
                  <hi>slaves</hi> assume, and the liberty which is due to <hi>children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Slaves</hi> take liberty <hi>from</hi> duty; children have liberty <hi>in</hi> duty; there is not a greater mistake in the world, then that the liberty of Sons in the house of God, consists in this, they can <hi>performe</hi> duties, or take the freedome to <hi>omit</hi> them; they <hi>can</hi> serve in the <hi>family</hi> of God; that is, they think they <hi>may if they</hi> will, and they can choose whether they will or no. This is a liberty stolne by <hi>Slaves,</hi> not a liberty given by the Spirit unto <hi>Sons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The liberty of <hi>Sons</hi> is in the inward spirituall freedome of their hearts naturally and kindly going out in all the ways and worship of God. When they find themselves straitened, and shut up in them, they wrestle with God for enlargement, and are never contented with the <hi>doing</hi> of a duty, unlesse it be done as in Christ, with free <hi>genuine</hi> and enlarged hearts. The liberty that servants have is <hi>from duty,</hi> the liberty given to Sons is in duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The liberty of <hi>slaves</hi> or servants is from mistaken de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving <hi>conclusions;</hi> The liberty of <hi>Sons</hi> is from the power of the <hi>indwelling Spirit</hi> of Grace; or the liberty of <hi>servants</hi> is from
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:60108:126"/>
outward dead <hi>conclusions,</hi> the liberty of Sons from an inward <hi>living principle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Love,</hi> as to the <hi>manner</hi> of their obedience gives them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and joy: Ioh. 14. 15. <hi>If yee love me</hi> (saies Christ <hi>keep my Commandements:</hi> Love is the bottome of all their dutys: hence our Saviour resolves all obedience into the <hi>love of God, and our Neighbour:</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> upon the same ground tells us, that Love is the <hi>fullfilling of the Law:</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 10. where love is in any duty it is compleate in Christ. How often doth <hi>David</hi> even with admiration expresse this principle of his walking with God: <hi>Oh</hi> (saith he) <hi>how I love thy Commandements.</hi> This gives Saints delight, that the Commandements of Christ are not <hi>grievous</hi> to them: <hi>Jacobs</hi> hard service was not grievous to him, because of his <hi>love to Rachel:</hi> No duty of a Saint is grievous to him, because of his <hi>love to Christ:</hi> They doe from hence all things with delight and Complacency: Hence doe they long for advantages of walking with God, pant after more ability, and this is a great share of their Son-like freedome in obedience. It gives them <hi>joy</hi> in it: 1 John 4. 18. there is <hi>no feare in Love, but perfect love casteth out feare:</hi> when their soule is acted to <hi>obedience</hi> by love; it expells that feare which is the issue of bondage upon the Spirit. Now when there is a concurrence of these two, <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> there is <hi>freedome, liberty, largenesse</hi> of heart, exceedingly distanced from that straight, and bondaged frame, which many walk in all their days, that know not the Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sons.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Object</hi> of their Obedience is represented to them as <hi>desireable,</hi> when to others as 'tis <hi>terrible.</hi> In all their approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>23</label> to God, they eye him as a <hi>Father;</hi> they <hi>call</hi> him Father; Gal. 4. 6. not in a forme of words, but in the spirit of Sons. God in Christ is continually before them not only as one <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving</hi> all the honour and obedience which he requires, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so as one <hi>exceedingly to be delighted in,</hi> as being all sufficient to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie and satiate all the desires of the soule; when others napkin their <hi>tallents,</hi> as having to deale with an <hi>austeer master,</hi> they draw out their strength to the uttermost, as drawing nigh to a <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious rewarder.</hi> They goe from the principle of life, and love to the bosome of a <hi>living</hi> and <hi>loving</hi> Father; they doe but returne
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:60108:127"/>
the strength they doe receive unto the fountaine, unto the Ocean.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Their <hi>Motive</hi> unto obedience is <hi>love</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 15. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>24</label> from an apprehension of <hi>love</hi> they are effectually carryed out by <hi>love,</hi> to give up themselves unto him who is love: What a freedome is this, what a largenesse of spirit is in them who walke according to this rule? Darkenesse, feare, bondage, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, hopes of Righteousnesse, accompany others in their ways: The <hi>Sonns</hi> by the Spirit of Adoption have light, Love with complacency in all their walkings with God; the world is an universall stranger unto the frame of children in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The <hi>Manner</hi> of their obedience is <hi>willingnesse. They yeild</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>themselves</hi> unto God, as those that are alive from the dead. Rom. 6. 13. they <hi>yeild themselves,</hi> give up themselves willingly, cheerfully, freely; with my whole heart (saith <hi>David):</hi> Rom. 12. 1. <hi>they present themselves</hi> a living sacrifice: and a willing sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Rule of their walking with God is the law of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>26</label> liberty, as <hi>divested</hi> of all its terrifying, threatning, killing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning, cursing power, and rendred in the blood of Jesus, sweet, tender, usefull, directing, helpfull as a <hi>rule</hi> of walking <hi>in</hi> the life they have received, not the way of working for the <hi>life</hi> they have not. I might give more instances. These may suffice to manifest that liberty of <hi>Obedience</hi> in the family of God which his <hi>sons,</hi> and <hi>daughters</hi> have, that the poor convinced <hi>Gibeonites</hi> are not acquainted withall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second thing which the Children of God have by <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>27</label> Adoption, is <hi>Title.</hi> They have <hi>Title</hi> &amp; right to all the priviledges and advantages of the <hi>family</hi> whereinto they are translated; This is the <hi>preheminence</hi> of the true sons of any family. The ground on which <hi>Sarah</hi> pleaded the ejection of <hi>Ishmael</hi> was, that he was the son of the <hi>bondwoman:</hi> Gen. 21. 10 and so no genuine Child of the family, and therefore could have no right of heir ship with <hi>Isaak.</hi> The Apostles arguing is, <hi>we are no more servants but Sons, and if Sons then heires</hi> Rom. 8. 14, 16. then have we <hi>right</hi> and <hi>Title,</hi> and being not borne hereunto (for by nature we are the Children of wrath) we have this Right by our Adoption.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:60108:127"/>

               <p n="2">2. They are <hi>heirs of Righteousnesse,</hi> Heb. 11. 7. <hi>Noah</hi> was an <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>35</label> heir of the righteousnesse which is by faith: which <hi>Peter</hi> calls a being <hi>heir of the grace of life,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 9. and <hi>James</hi> puts both these together, Jam. 2. 6. <hi>heirs of the Kingdome which God hath promised:</hi> that is, of the <hi>kingdome of Grace,</hi> and the righteousnesse thereof, and in this respect it is that the Apostle tels us, Eph. 1. 11. that <hi>we have obtained an inheritance;</hi> which he also places with the <hi>righteousnesse of Faith,</hi> Acts 26. 13.

               <p>And this is that which is the <hi>maine</hi> of the Saints <hi>Title</hi> and right which they have by adoption: which in summe is, that the <hi>Lord is their portion,</hi> and inheritance, and they are the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of the Lord; And a large portion it is that they have.

The Lord by his <hi>soveraignty,</hi> had made an originall grant of all things here below for mans use; he had appointed the <hi>residue</hi> of the works of his hands in their severall <hi>stations,</hi> to be serviceable unto his behoofe.

them off from the <hi>end,</hi> to which they were originally appointed, is a part of their vanity, and curse. It is evill to any thing to be <hi>Layed</hi> aside as to the end, to which it was primitively appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: by this meanes the whole Creation is turned loose from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>subordinate ruler;</hi> And man having lost the <hi>whole</hi> Title where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he held his dominion over, and possession of the creatures, hath not the least colour of interest in any of them, nor can lay any claime unto them; but now the Lord intending to take a <hi>portion</hi> to himselfe, out of the <hi>lumpe</hi> of fallen mankind, whom he appointed <hi>heirs of Salvation,</hi> he doth not immediately destroy the works of creation, but reserve them for their use in their pilgrimage. To this end he invests the whole <hi>right</hi> and title of them in the <hi>second Adam,</hi> which the first had lost; he appoints him, <hi>heire of all things.</hi> And thereupon his <hi>adopted ones, being fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low heirs with Christ,</hi> become also to have a <hi>right</hi> and title unto the things of this creation.</p>
               <p>To cleare up this right what it is, I must give some few ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations. <label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Right they have, is not as the right that Christ hath: That is Soveraigne, and supreme, to doe what he will with his own: but theirs subordinate, &amp; such, as that they must be <hi>account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> for the use of those things whereunto they have a right and title. The right of Christ, is the right of the <hi>Lord</hi> of the house, the right of the Saints is the right of <hi>Servants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That the <hi>whole number</hi> of the children of God have a right unto the <hi>whole earth,</hi> which is the Lords and the fullnesse thereof, in these two regards.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He</hi> who is the <hi>Soveraigne Lord</hi> of it, doth preserve it meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their <hi>use,</hi> and upon their account: all others whatever being <hi>malae fidei possessores,</hi> invading a portion of the Lords terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, without grant or leave from him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In that Christ hath promised to give them the Kingdome and dominion of it, in such a way and manner, as in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence he shall dispose; that is, that the government of the <hi>earth</hi> shall be exercised to their advantage.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This right is a <hi>spirituall right,</hi> which doth not give a <hi>civill interest,</hi> but only <hi>sanctifies</hi> the right and interest bestowed God hath <hi>providentially</hi> disposed of the civill <hi>bounds</hi> of the inheritance of men, Acts 17. 26. suffering the men of the <hi>world</hi> to enjoy a

portion here, and that oftentimes very <hi>full,</hi> and plenteous, and that for his childrens sake, that those <hi>beasts</hi> of the forrest, which are made to be destroyed, may not breake loose upon the whole possession. Hence</p>
               <p n="4">4. No <hi>one particular adopted person,</hi> hath any right by vertue thereof, to any portion of earthly things, whereunto he hath not right and Title upon a <hi>civill interest</hi> given him by the Providence of God. But</p>
               <p n="5">5. This they have by their Adoption, that</p>
               <p n="1">1. Look what <hi>portion</hi> soever God is pleased to give them, they have a <hi>right</hi> unto it, as it is <hi>reinvested</hi> in Christ, and not as it lies wholly under the Curse and vanity that is come upon the Creation by sin, and therefore can never be called unto an <hi>account</hi> for usurping that which they have no right unto, as shall all the <hi>sons</hi> of men, who violently graspe those things which God hath set at liberty from under their dominion because of sinne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By this their right, they are <hi>lead</hi> unto a sanctified use of what thereby they doe enjoy: in asmuch as the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are to them <hi>pledges</hi> of the Fathers Love, washed in the blood of Christ, and endearements upon their spirits to live to his <hi>praise,</hi> who gives them all things rithly to enjoy.</p>
               <p>And this is a second thing we have by our Adoption: and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>38</label> hence I dare say of unbelievers: they have no true right unto any thing of what kind soever; that they do possesse.</p>
               <p>They have no true, vnquestionable right I say even unto the <hi>temporall</hi> things they do possesse; it is true they have a <hi>civill right</hi> in respect of others, but they have not a <hi>sanctifyed</hi> right in respect of their own Soules. They have a right and Title that will hold plea in the <hi>Courts of men,</hi> but not a right that will hold in the court of God, and in their own Conscience. It will one day be sad with them when they shall come to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their enjoyments. They shall not only be <hi>reckoned</hi> withall for the abuse of that they have possessed, that they have not used, &amp; laid it out for the glory of him whose it is but also that they have ever <hi>layed</hi> their hands upon the Creatures of God, and kept them from them for whose sakes alone they are <hi>preserved</hi> from destruction. When the <hi>God of Glory</hi> shall come home to any of them, either in their <hi>consciences</hi> here, or in the

                  <hi>Judgement</hi> that is for to come, and speake with the <hi>terror</hi> of a revengefull judge: I have suffered you to enjoy <hi>Corne, Wine,</hi> and <hi>Oyle,</hi> a great portion of my <hi>creatures;</hi> you have rolled your selves in <hi>wealth</hi> and prosperity, when the <hi>right heires</hi> of these things lived <hi>poor,</hi> and <hi>low,</hi> and meane at the next doores; Give in now an answer what, and how you have <hi>used</hi> these things, what have you laid out for the service and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Gospell? what have you given unto them for whom nothing was provided? What contribution have you made for the poor Saints? have you had a ready hand, and willing minde to lay down all for my sake? When they shall be compelled to answer as the truth is, Lord, we had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a <hi>large portion</hi> in the world, but we tooke it to be our own, &amp; thought we might have done what we would with our own, we have eat the fat, and dranke the sweet, and left the rest of our substance for our babes; we have spent somewhat upon our <hi>lusts,</hi> somewhat upon our <hi>friends,</hi> but the truth is we cannot say that we made friends of this unrighteous <hi>mammon,</hi> that we used it to the advancement of the Gospell or for mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string unto thy <hi>poor</hi> Saints, and now behold we must dye, &amp;c. So also when the Lord shall proceed further and question not only the <hi>use</hi> of these things, but also their <hi>Title</hi> to them, and tell them the <hi>Earth is mine and the fullnesse thereof:</hi> I did indeed make an originall grant of these things to <hi>man,</hi> but that is <hi>lost</hi> by sin; I have <hi>restored</hi> it only for my Saints, why have you laid then <hi>your fingers of prey</hi> upon that which was not yours, why have you compelled my <hi>creatures</hi> to serve you, and your lusts, which I had set at loose from under your dominion: Give me my <hi>flax,</hi> my <hi>wine</hi> and <hi>wool,</hi> I'le set you naked as in the day of <hi>your birth,</hi> and revenge upon you your <hi>rapine,</hi> and unjust possession of that which was not yours.

come upon you, which you are to suffer) before hand, least you who (poore soules) have entertained expectations of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther state of affaires, should be <hi>surprized,</hi> so as to be <hi>offended</hi> at me, and my <hi>doctrine,</hi> and fall away from me. You are now <hi>forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> and know what you have to look for. Yea, saith he, v. 2. having acquainted you in <hi>generall,</hi> that you shall be persecuted, I tell you plainly, that there shall be a <hi>combination</hi> of all men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you, and all sorts of men will put forth their power for your ruine. <hi>They shall cast you out of the Synagogue, and the time shall come, that whosoever killes you, will think that he doth God good service.</hi> The <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> power shall <hi>Excommunicate</hi> you, they shall put you out of their <hi>Synagogues;</hi> and that you may not expect reliefe from the power of the <hi>magistrate</hi> against their <hi>perversity,</hi> they will <hi>kill</hi> you; and that you may know that they will doe it to the purpose, without check or <hi>controle,</hi> they will think that in kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, they doe <hi>God</hi> good service, which will cause them to act rigorously, and to the utmost.</p>
               <p>But this is a shaking triall, might they reply: is our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>3</label> such, that men in killing us, will think to approve their Consciences to God? Yea they will saith our Saviour; but yet that you be not mistaken, nor trouble your consciences about their <hi>confidences,</hi> know that their blind and desperate <hi>ignorance</hi> is the cause of their fury and perswasion, v. 3. <hi>These things will they doe unto you, because they have not known the Father nor me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This then was to be the <hi>state</hi> with the <hi>Disciples;</hi> but why did <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>with you:</hi> but now the state of things is altered; <hi>I must leave you,</hi> v. 5.

               <p>There are two things in the words. Christs <hi>departure,</hi> and the <hi>usefulnesse</hi> of it to his Disciples. For his departure, it is known what is intended by it: The withdrawing his <hi>bodily</hi> presence from the <hi>earth</hi> after his Resurrection, the <hi>heavens being to receive him, untill the time of the restitution of all things.</hi> For in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect <note place="margin">Acts 3. 21.</note> of his <hi>Diety,</hi> and the exercise of <hi>Love</hi> and care towards them, he promised to be with them to the end of the world, Mat. 28. last. Of this saith he <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>This is the sum: the presence of the Holy Ghost with Believers as a Comforter sent by Christ for those ends and purposes for which he is promised; is better and more profitable for Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers then any <hi>corporeall</hi> presence of Christ can be, now he hath fullfilled the one <hi>sacrifice</hi> for sinne, which he was to offer.</p>

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:60108:135"/>
Communion with the Father in <hi>Love,</hi> the Son, in <hi>Grace,</hi> and the Holy Ghost in Consolation. This is the door and entrance of that <hi>fellowship</hi> of of the Holy Ghost, whereunto we are called. His <hi>Gracious</hi> and blessed <hi>Will,</hi> his infinite &amp; ineffable <hi>condesension</hi> being <hi>eyed</hi> by Faith, as the foundation of all those Effects, which he workes in us, and <hi>Priviledges</hi> whereof by him we are made partakers, our soules are peculiarly conversant with him, and their Desires, affections, and thankfullnesse, terminated in him: of which more afterwards. This is the first thing consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable is our Communion with the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The manner of his <hi>collaion,</hi> or bestowing; or the manner of his Communication unto us from this fountain is hereinalso <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>15</label> considerable, and it is variously expressed to denote three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>freenesse</hi> of it: thus he is said to be <hi>given</hi> Joh. 14. 16. he shall <hi>give</hi> you another comforter; I need not multiply places to this purpose. The most frequent <hi>Adjunct</hi> of the Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Nehem. 9. 20,</note> of the Spirit is this, that he is <hi>given,</hi> and received as of <hi>Gift,</hi> he will <hi>give</hi> his holy Spirit to them that aske him: that <note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 16. Ioh. 7. 39. 20. 22. Acts 2. 28. 5. 32. 8. 15. 10. 47. 15. 8. 19. 2. Rom. 5. 5. 1 Cor. 2. 11. 6. 19. 12. 7. 1 Thes. 4. 8. 1 Ioh. 4. 14.</note> which is of <hi>gift</hi> is <hi>free,</hi> the Spirit of grace is <hi>given</hi> of grace: And not only the Spirit of Sanctification, or the Spirit to <hi>Sanctifie &amp; convert</hi> us, is a <hi>gift</hi> of <hi>free grace,</hi> but in the sence whereof we speak in respect of <hi>consolation</hi> he is of <hi>gift</hi> also; he is promised to be <hi>given</hi> unto Believers. Hence the <hi>Spirit</hi> is said to be received by the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,</hi> not by the <hi>Law,</hi> Gal. 3. 2 that is of <hi>meer grace</hi> &amp; not of our <hi>own procuring.</hi> And all his workings are called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, free <hi>donations.</hi> He is freely bestowed and <hi>freely</hi> workes: and the different mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures wherein he is received for those ends and purposes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation which we shall consider, by Believers, which are <hi>great, various</hi> and unexpressable, arise from hence that we have him by <hi>donation,</hi> or <hi>freegift.</hi> And this is the <hi>Tenor</hi> whereby we hold and enjoy him: a Tenor of <hi>free donation.</hi> So is he to be <hi>eyed,</hi> so to be <hi>asked,</hi> so to be <hi>received.</hi> And this also faith takes in, and closeth withall, in our Communion with the Comforter. The Conjunction and accord of his <hi>Will,</hi> with the Guift of <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Sonne:</hi> The one respecting the <hi>distinct</hi> operation of the <hi>Deity</hi> in the Person of the Holy Ghost; the other the <hi>oeconomy</hi> of the whole Trinity, in the worke of our Salvation by Jesus Christ. Here the Soul rejoyceth its selfe in the Comforter; that he is
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:60108:135"/>
                  <hi>willing</hi> to <hi>come</hi> to him, that he is willing to be given him. And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all is <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Gift,</hi> Grace is magnifyed on this account.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Authority</hi> of it! thence he is said to be SENT; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>16</label> Chap. 14. 26. the Father will <hi>send</hi> him in my name: and Chap. 15. 26. I will send him unto you from the Father, and him <hi>will I send to you</hi> chap 16. 17. This <hi>mission</hi> of the holy Ghost by the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> as it <hi>answers</hi> the order of the persons <hi>subsistence</hi> in the blessed <hi>Trinity,</hi> and his procession from them both, so the order voluntarily engaged in by them, for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment, (as was said) of the worke of our Salvation. There is in it, in a most speciall manner the <hi>Condescension of the Holy Ghost</hi> in his Love to us, to the <hi>Authoritative</hi> delegation of Father, and Son, in this businesse: which argues not a <hi>disparity dissimilitude,</hi> or <hi>inequality of Essence,</hi> but of <hi>Office,</hi> in this worke: It is the <hi>Office</hi> of the Holy Ghost to be an <hi>Advocate</hi> for us, and a <hi>Comforter</hi> to us; in which respect, not absolutely, he is thus sent <hi>Authoritatively</hi> by Father and Sonne: It is a known <hi>maxime,</hi> that <hi>Inaequalitas officii non tollit aequalitatem naturae:</hi> This subjection (if I may so call it) or <hi>inequality</hi> in respect of <hi>office</hi> doth no way's prejudice the <hi>equality</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> which he hath with <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Sonne,</hi> no more then the <hi>mission</hi> of the Son by the Father doth his. And on this <hi>Authoritative</hi> mission of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> doth the right Apprehensions of many <hi>mysterys</hi> in the Gospell, and the ordering of our hearts in Communion with him depend.</p>
               <p>Hence is the sinne against the Holy Ghost (what it is I doe <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>17</label> not now dispute) <hi>unpardonable;</hi> and hath that <hi>Adjunct</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion put upon it, that no other sin hath: namely because he <hi>comes</hi> not, he <hi>acts</hi> not in his own <hi>name</hi> only, though in his <hi>own also,</hi> but in the name and <hi>Authority</hi> of the Father &amp; Son, <hi>from</hi> and <hi>by</hi> whom he is sent; and therefore to sinne against him, is to sinne against all the <hi>Authority</hi> of God, all the <hi>Love</hi> of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and the utmost <hi>condescension</hi> of each person to the worke of our Salvation. It is I say from the <hi>Authoritative mission</hi> of the Spirit that the sinne against him is peculiarly unpardonable; It is a sin against the <hi>recapitulation</hi> of the love of the Father, Son, and Spirit. And from this consideration, were that our present businesse, might the true nature of the <hi>sin against the Holy Ghost</hi> be investigated. Certainely it must consist in the contempt of some operation of his, as acting in the name and Authority of the whole Trinity, and that in their ineffable <hi>condescension</hi> to
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:60108:136"/>
the worke of Grace. But this is of another Consideration.</p>
               <p n="2">2. On this account, we are to <hi>pray</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>18</label> to give the Spirit to us Luk. 11. 13. <hi>your Heavenly Father will give his holy Spirit to them that aske him:</hi> now the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> being <hi>God,</hi> is no lesse to be <hi>invocated, praied</hi> to, and called on, then the Father and Son, as elsewhere I have proved; how then doe we aske the Father for him, as we doe in all <hi>our Supplications,</hi> seeing that we also pray that he himselfe would come to us visite us, and abide with us? In our prayers that are directed to himselfe, we consider him as <hi>essentially God</hi> over all blessed for evermore; we pray for him from the Father and Sonne, as under this <hi>mission</hi> and delegation from them. And indeed God having most <hi>plentifully</hi> revealed himselfe in the order of this <hi>dispensation</hi> to us, we are (as Christians generally do,) in our Communion to abound in answerable addresses; that is not onely to the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> of the holy Ghost himselfe, but properly to the Father and Son, for him which refers to this dispensation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence is that great weight in particular laid upon our <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>19</label> not <hi>grieving</hi> the spirit, Eph. 4. 30. because he comes to <hi>us</hi> in the <hi>name,</hi> with the <hi>Love,</hi> and upon the condescension of the whole blessed <hi>Trinity.</hi> To doe that which might <hi>grieve him so</hi> sent, on such an account, for that <hi>end</hi> and purpose which shall afterwards be mentioned, is a great <hi>aggravation</hi> of sinne. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects <hi>cheerfull</hi> entertainment with us, and may do so justly upon his own account; and the account of the <hi>work</hi> which he comes about: but when this <hi>also</hi> is added; that he is <hi>sent</hi> of the Father, and the Son, <hi>commissioned</hi> with their <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate them to <hi>their soules,</hi> this is that which is, or ought to be of unspeakable esteeme with Believers. And this is that second thing expressed in the manner of his <hi>communication,</hi> he is sent by Authority.</p>
               <p>He is said to be <hi>powred out, or shed on us,</hi> Titus 3. 6. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>20</label> that holy Ghost which he hath <hi>richly powred</hi> out upon us, or shed on us abundantly: And this was the chiefe <hi>expression</hi> of his communication under the old Testament, the <hi>mystery of the Father and the Son,</hi> and the matter of <hi>commission</hi> and <hi>delegation</hi> being then not so clearly discovered, Isaiah 32. 15. untill the <hi>spirit be powred on us</hi> from on high, and the wildernesse be a fruitfull field, and the fruitfull field be counted for a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest;
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:60108:136"/>
that is, 'till the <hi>Gentiles</hi> be called, and the Jews <hi>rejected:</hi> and chap. 43 3 I will <hi>powre my spirit</hi> upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thy offspring, that eminent place of Zech. 12. 10. is all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in our thoughts. Now this expression, as is known, is taken from the <hi>allusion</hi> of the spirit unto water: and that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to all the <hi>uses</hi> of <hi>water</hi> both <hi>naturall</hi> and Typicall: a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular relation of them, I cannot now insist on: perhaps <hi>effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy</hi> and <hi>plenty</hi> are chiefely intended.</p>
               <p>Now this threefold expression of <hi>giving, sending,</hi> and <hi>powring</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>21</label> out of the spirit, gives us the three great <hi>properties</hi> of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> of grace.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That it is <hi>free,</hi> he is <hi>given.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. That it is orderly, ordered in all <hi>things</hi> and <hi>sure;</hi> from the <hi>love</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> by the <hi>procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the sonne; and thence is that variety of expression, of the Fathers <hi>sending</hi> him, and the Son's <hi>sending</hi> him from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he being the <hi>gift</hi> of the Father's <hi>love,</hi> and the <hi>purchase</hi> of the blood of the sonne;</item>
                  <item>3. The efficacy of it, as was last obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And this is the second thing considerable.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="3">3. The third, which is our <hi>receiving</hi> him, I shall speak more briefly of. That which I first proposed, of the spirit considered <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>22</label> as a spirit of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and a spirit of <hi>consolation,</hi> is here to be minded. Our receiving of him, as a spirit of <hi>sanctification</hi> is a meer <hi>passive reception,</hi> as a vessell receiv's water. He comes as the wind on <hi>Ezechiel's</hi> dead bones, and makes them live. He comes into <hi>dead</hi> hearts, and quickens them, by an act of his <hi>Allmighty</hi> power: but now as he is the spirit of <hi>consolation,</hi> it is otherwise; in this sense our Saviour tells us that the <hi>world cannot receive him,</hi> Ioh. 14 17. the world <hi>receiveth</hi> him not, because it <hi>seeth him</hi> not, <hi>nor knows him: but ye know him, for he dwelleth with you, and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in you.</hi> That it is the spirit of <hi>consolation,</hi> or the spirit for <hi>consolation</hi> that here is promised, is evident from the close of the verse where he is said, <hi>then</hi> to be <hi>in</hi> them, when he is promised to them. He was <hi>in</hi> them as a spirit of <hi>quickning</hi> and <hi>sanctification</hi> when promised to them, as a <hi>spirit of comfort</hi> and consolation, to abide with them for that purpose. Now the <hi>power,</hi> that is here denied to be in the <hi>world,</hi> with the reason of it, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>receive</hi> the spirit, because they <hi>know</hi> him not, is ascribed to <hi>Believers;</hi> they can <hi>receive</hi> him, because they <hi>know</hi> him. So that
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:60108:137"/>
there is an <hi>active</hi> power to be put forth in his <hi>reception</hi> for <hi>conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> though not in his reception for Regeneration and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification. And this is the power of faith, so Gal. 3. 2. they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the spirit by the hearing of the Faith; the <hi>Preaching</hi> of the Gospell begetting faith in them, enabled them to receive the Spirit. Hence <hi>believing</hi> is put as the qualification of all our receiving the holy Ghost, Joh. 7. 39. <hi>this he spake of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive:</hi> it is <hi>Believers</hi> that thus receive the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and they receive him by <hi>Faith:</hi> now there are three speciall acts of Faith, whereby it goes forth in the <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> of the spirit, I shall but name them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It considers the <hi>spirit</hi> in the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> before described, as <hi>promised.</hi> It is <hi>Faith</hi> alone, that makes <hi>profit</hi> of the <hi>benefit</hi> of the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>23</label> promises: Heb. 4. 2. now he is called the <hi>spirit of that promise,</hi> Eph: 2. 13. the spirit that in the <hi>covenant is promised,</hi> and we receive the <hi>promise</hi> of the spirit through Faith, Gal. 3. 14. so that the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the <hi>Spirit</hi> through Faith, is the receiving of him as <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised:</hi> faith eyes the <hi>promise</hi> of God, and of Jesus Christ, of <hi>sending</hi> the spirit for all those ends, that he is desired: thus it depends, waits, <hi>mixing</hi> the <hi>promise</hi> with it selfe, untill it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By <hi>Prayer:</hi> He is given as a <hi>spirit of supplication,</hi> that we may <hi>aske</hi> him as a spirit of <hi>consolation,</hi> Luk. 11. 13. and indeed this <hi>asking of the Spirit</hi> of God, in the <hi>name</hi> of Christ, either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or immediately, or under the name of some fruit and <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> of him, is the chiefest <hi>work</hi> of faith in this World.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It cherisheth him, by <hi>attending</hi> to his <hi>motions, improving</hi> his actings according to his mind and will: which is all I shall say to this third thing, or our <hi>receiving</hi> of the Spirit, which is sent of Jesus Christ; we doe it by faith, looking on him as <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased</hi> by Jesus Christ, and <hi>promised</hi> of the Father, we seek him at the <hi>hands</hi> of God, and doe <hi>receive</hi> him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The next considerable thing, is his <hi>abode</hi> with us; now this is two wayes <hi>expressed</hi> in the Scripture; 1. In <hi>generall,</hi> as to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>24</label> the thing it selfe, it is said he shall <hi>abide</hi> with us; 2. In <hi>particular</hi> as to the <hi>manner</hi> of its abiding, it is by <hi>inhabitation</hi> or indwelling. Of the <hi>inhabitation</hi> of the spirit, I have spoken <note place="margin">Persev. of Saints ch. 8.</note> fully <hi>elsewhere,</hi> nor shall I now insist on it: only whereas the spirit, as hath been <hi>observed,</hi> is considered as a <hi>spirit</hi> of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:60108:137"/>
, or a spirit of <hi>consolation:</hi> He is said to dwell in us <hi>chiefely</hi> or perhaps <hi>solely,</hi> as he is a spirit of <hi>sanctification;</hi> which is evident from the work he doth, as indwelling; <hi>He quickneth and sanctifieth,</hi> Rom. 8. 11. and the manner of his indwelling, as in <hi>a Temple,</hi> which he makes <hi>holy</hi> thereby, 2 Cor. 6. and his <hi>perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency</hi> in his so doing, which, as is <hi>evident,</hi> relates to <hi>sanctification</hi> only: but yet the generall notion of it in <hi>abiding,</hi> is ascribed to him as a <hi>Comforter,</hi> Joh. 14. 16. he shall <hi>abide with you for ever;</hi> now all the difficulty of this promise lies in <hi>this,</hi> that whereas the spirit of <hi>sanctification</hi> dwells in us allwaies, and it is therefore impossible that we should <hi>loose</hi> utterly our <hi>holinesse;</hi> whence is it; that, if the <hi>Comforter</hi> abide with us for <hi>ever,</hi> we may yet utterly loose <hi>our Comfort?</hi> a little to clear this in our passage.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He is <hi>promised</hi> to abide with the Disciples for <hi>ever,</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the <hi>abode</hi> of Christ: Christ in the <hi>flesh,</hi> had been <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>25</label> with them for a little while, and now was <hi>leaving</hi> them, and going to his Father. He had been the <hi>comforter</hi> immediatly him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for a season, but is now upon his <hi>departing;</hi> wherefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising them <hi>another comforter,</hi> they might feare that he would even but <hi>visit</hi> them for a little season also, and then their <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> would be worser then ever. Nay but saith our Saviour feare it not, this is the last <hi>dispensation:</hi> there is to be no <hi>Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> when I am gone, the Comforter is to doe all the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work: there is not <hi>another</hi> to be looked for, and I promise you him; nor shall he <hi>depart</hi> from you, but allwaies abide with you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Comforter</hi> may allwaies abide with us, though not <label type="milestone">

               <p n="4">4. The Spirit often <hi>works</hi> for it, and <hi>tenders</hi> consolation to <label type="milestone">

To insist on the severall ways whereby men <hi>refuse comfort,</hi> and come short of the strong <hi>consolation,</hi> which God is willing that we should receive, is not my purpose at present.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>1</label>; I come in the next place to declare what are his <hi>actings</hi> in us, and towards us, being so bestowed on us, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by us Now here are two generall Heads to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; 1. The manner and kind of his actings in us, which are
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:60108:138"/>
variously expressed: and 2. The <hi>particular products</hi> of his actings in our soules, wherein we have Communion with him. The first is variously expressed: I shall passe through them brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He is said <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to worke effectually, 1 Cor. 12. 11. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>2</label> all these worketh or effecteth <hi>that one and selfe same spirit:</hi> it is spoken there indeed in respect of his <hi>distribution</hi> of gifts: but the way is the same for the Communication of Graces, and <hi>priviledges:</hi> he doth it by working, which as it convinces his <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonality,</hi> especially as considered with the words following, <hi>dividing to every man according to his will,</hi> (for to worke accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to will is the the inseparable property of a person, and is spoken expressely of God, Eph. 1. 11.) so in relation to v. 6. <hi>foregoing,</hi> it makes no lesse evident his <hi>Deity.</hi> What he is here said to doe as the Spirit bestowed on us, and given unto us; there is he said as God himselfe to doe: <hi>there are diversity of operations but it is one God that worketh all in all;</hi> which here in other words is; <hi>all these worketh the selfe same spirit dividing to every man as he will;</hi> What we have then from him, we have by the way of his <hi>ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geticall</hi> working; It is not by <hi>proposing</hi> this or that Argument to us, perswading us by <hi>these or</hi> those <hi>morall motives</hi> or inducements alone, leaving us to make <hi>use of</hi> them as we can; But he workes <hi>effectually</hi> himselfe, what he communicates of <hi>Grace,</hi> or consolation to us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the same <hi>verse</hi> as to the manner of his operation, He is <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>3</label> said <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he <hi>divideth</hi> or distributeth <hi>to every one as he will.</hi> This of <hi>distribution</hi> adds to that of <hi>operation, choise,</hi> judgement, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. He that <hi>distributes</hi> variously doth it with choise and judgement, and freedome of will: such are the proceedings of the Spirit in his dispensations: to one he giveth one thing emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently to another another. To one in one degree, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in another; Thus are the Saints in his <hi>soveraginty</hi> kept in a constant <hi>dependance</hi> on him; He distributs as he will; who should not be content with his portion? what claime can any lay to that which he distributeth as he will? which is farther mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested,</p>
               <p n="3">3. By his being said to <hi>give,</hi> when and what he bestows; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>4</label> they speake with other tongues, as the spirit gave them utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Act. 2. 4. he gave them to them, that is freely; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:60108:139"/>
he bestows npo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> us, is of his gift. And hence it is to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that in the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of our Salvation, the acting of no one person doth prejudice the frreedome and liberty of any other; so the <hi>Love</hi> of the Father in <hi>sending</hi> the Sonne is free, and his sending doth no ways prejudice the <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of the Son, but that he lays <hi>down his life freely</hi> also. So the <hi>Sati-faction</hi> and purchase made by the <hi>Sonne</hi> doth no way prejudice the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Fathers <hi>Grace</hi> in pardoning &amp; accepting us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon: so the <hi>Father's</hi> and <hi>Sonne's</hi> sending of the Spirit doth not derogate from his freedome in his <hi>workings,</hi> but he gives freely what he givts. And the reason of this is, because the <hi>will</hi> of the <hi>Father, Sonne,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is essentially the same; so that in the <hi>acting</hi> of one there is the Counsell of all, and each freely therein.</p>
               <p>Thus in Generall is the manner and kind of his working in <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>5</label> us and towards us, being bestowed upon us, described. Power, choyse, freedome, are evidently denoted in theexpressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons insisted on. It is not any peculiar worke of his towards us, that is hereby declared, but the manner how he doth produce the <hi>Effects,</hi> that shall be insisted on.</p>
               <p>That which remaines in the <hi>last</hi> place for the explanation of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>6</label> the things proposed to be explained as the <hi>foundation</hi> of the <hi>Communion</hi> which we have with the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> is the <hi>Effects</hi> that being thus sent &amp; thus <hi>working</hi> he doth produce; which I shall do, not casting them into any artificiall method, but taking them up as I find them lying scattered up and down in the Scripture, only descending from those which are more <hi>generall,</hi> to those which are more particular, neither aiming nor desiring to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the <hi>severalls,</hi> but insisting on those which do most <hi>obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously</hi> occurre.</p>
               <p>Only as formerly, so now you must observe, that I speake of the spirit, principally, if not only as a <hi>comforter,</hi> and not as a <hi>san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifier:</hi>

               <p>Nor 2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> shall I insist on those things which the <hi>comforter</hi> doth in Believers, effect towards others, in his <hi>testifying</hi> of them, and

               <p n="1">1. The first and most generall is that of Ioh. 14. 26. <hi>He shall</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>2</label> 
                  <hi>teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, that I have spoken to you.</hi> There are two parts of this promise,</p>

                  <item>1. Of <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>

               <p>Of his <hi>Teaching</hi> I shall speak afterwards, when I come to treat of his <hi>anoynting</hi> us.</p>
               <p>His <hi>bringing the things to remembrance</hi> that Christ spake, is the first generall promise of him as a <hi>Comforter.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>3</label> he shall <hi>make you mind</hi> all these things; now this also may be considered two waies:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Meerly in respect of <hi>the things spoken themselves.</hi> So our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour here <hi>promiseth</hi> his Apostles, that the holy Ghost should bring to their minds by an <hi>immediate efficacy,</hi> the things that he had spoken, that by his <hi>inspiration</hi> they might be enabled to <hi>write</hi> and Preach them for the good and benefit of his Church.
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:60108:140"/>
So <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, 1 Ep. 1. 21. <hi>Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost;</hi> that is, in writing the <hi>Scripture.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>borne up by him,</hi> carried beyond themselves, to speak his words, and what he <hi>indited</hi> to them. The Apostles forgot much of what Christ had <hi>said</hi> to them, or might doe so; and what they did retaine in a naturall way of Remembrance, was not a <hi>sufficient foundation</hi> to them to write what they so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, for a <hi>rule</hi> of faith to the Church. For the <hi>word</hi> of Prophesy, is not <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, from any mans proper <hi>impulse;</hi> it comes not from any <hi>private</hi> conception, understanding, or <hi>Remembrance.</hi> Wherefore Christ promises that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> shall doe this work, that they might <hi>infallibly</hi> give out what he had delivered to them. Hence that expression in <hi>Luke</hi> chap. 1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is better rendred, having obtained perfect knowledge of things <hi>from above;</hi> noting the rise and spring of his so understanding things, as to be able infallibly to give them out in a Rule of Faith to the Church, then the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi> of the things themselves spoken of; which the word it selfe, will not easily allow of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In respect of the <hi>Comfort</hi> of what he had spoken; which <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>4</label> seems to be a <hi>great</hi> part of the intendment of this promise. He had been speaking to them things suited for their <hi>consolation;</hi> giving them <hi>pretious</hi> promises of the <hi>supplies</hi> they should have from him in <hi>this life;</hi> of the Love of the <hi>Father,</hi> of the <hi>Glory</hi> he was providing for them; the sense and comfort whereof is unspeakable, and the <hi>joy arising</hi> from them, full of Glory. But, saith he, I know how unable you are to make <hi>use</hi> of these things for your own consolation; The Spirit therefore shall <hi>recover</hi> them upon your minds in their full <hi>strength</hi> and vigour for that end, for which I speake them. And this is one cause why it was expedient for <hi>Believers</hi> that Christ's <hi>bodily</hi> absence, should be supplied by the presence of the Spirit. Whilest he was <hi>with</hi> them, how little <hi>Efficacy</hi> on their hearts had any of the <hi>heavenly promises</hi> he gave them? when the Spirit came, how full <hi>of joy</hi> did he make all things to them? That which was his <hi>peculiar work,</hi> which belonged to him by vertue of his <hi>Office,</hi> that he also might be glorified, was reserved for him. And this is his work to the end of the World, To bring the promises of Christ to <hi>our minds</hi> and hearts, to give us the <hi>comfort</hi> of them, the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:60108:140"/>
joy and sweetnesse of them, much beyond that which the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples found in them, when Christ in person spake them to them; their gratious <hi>influence</hi> being then restrained, that, as was said, the <hi>dispensation</hi> of the spirit might be glorified; so are the <hi>next</hi> words to this promise, v. 27. <hi>My peace I leave with you, peace I give unto you.</hi> The <hi>comforter</hi> being sent to bring what Christ said, to remembrance, the consequent of it is <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>freedome</hi> from trouble of heart: what ever <hi>peace,</hi> reliefe, comfort, joy, supportment, we have at any time received from any work, promise, or thing done by <hi>Christ,</hi> it all belongs to this dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Comforter. In vaine should we apply our <hi>naturall abilities</hi> to <hi>remember,</hi> call to mind, consider the promises of Christ: Without successe would it be; it is so daily: but when the <hi>Comforter</hi> doth undertake the <hi>work,</hi> it is done to the purpose, How we have peculiar <hi>communion</hi> with him herein; in faith and obedience, in the <hi>consolation</hi> received, in and by the promises of him <hi>brought to mind,</hi> shall be afterwards declared. This in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall is obtained. Our Saviour Jesus Christ leaving the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy even of <hi>those</hi> promises, which in <hi>person</hi> he gave to his Apostles in their great distresse, as to their consolation, unto the Holy Ghost, we may see the <hi>immediate spring</hi> of all the spirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort we have in this world, and the fellowship which we have with the Holy Ghost therein.</p>
               <p>Only here, as in all the particulars following the manner <label type="milestone">

to their Advantage, sometimes the Heavens are black over them, and the Earth trembles under them; publick, personall calamities and distresses appeare so full of horror, and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that they are ready to faint with the Apprehensions of them. Hence is their great reliefe, and the retrivement of their Spirits; their consolation nor trouble depend not on any out ward condition, nor inward frame of their own hearts; but on the powerfull and effectuall workings of the Holy Ghost; which by <hi>Faith</hi> they give themselves up unto.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Voluntarily:</hi> distributing to every one as he will: and therefore is this work done in so great <hi>variety,</hi> both as to the <label type="milestone">

And this faith espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially regards in the whole businesse of consolation: it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the soveraigne will of the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> and so is not ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto any <hi>rules,</hi> or course of procedure.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Freely.</hi> Much of the <hi>variety</hi> of the dispensation of Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation by promises, depends on this <hi>freedome</hi> of the <hi>spirits</hi> ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Hence it is that comfort is given <hi>unexpectedly,</hi> when the heart hath all the Reasons in the World to look for <hi>destresse</hi> and sorrow; thus sometimes it is the first meanes of recovering a backsliding soule, who might justly expect to be <hi>utterly</hi> cast off. And these considerations are to be carried on, in all the other <hi>Effects</hi> and fruits of the Comforter; of which afterwards. And in this first generall <hi>Effect</hi> or work of the Holy Ghost towards us, have we <hi>communion</hi> and fellowship with him. The Life and Soule of all our comforts lye treasured up in the <hi>promises</hi> of Christ. They are the <hi>breasts</hi> of all our consolation. Who knows not how <hi>powerlesse</hi> they are in the bare letter, even when improved to the uttermost, by our considerations of them, and meditation on them: as also how unexpectedly they some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:60108:141"/>
break in upon the soule, wth a conquering, endearing <hi>Life</hi> and vigour: Here Faith deales peculiarly with the Holy Ghost: It considers the promises themselves; looks up to him; waites for him, considers his appearances: in the word de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on, ownes him in his work and Efficacy. No sooner doth the soule begin to feele the life of a promise, warming his heart, relieving, cherishing, supporting, delivering from feare, entanglements, or troubles, but it may, it ought to know, that the Holy Ghost is there; which will adde to his joy, and lead him into <hi>fellowship</hi> with him.</p>

And this is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident signe of a <hi>false spirit;</hi> what ever its pretence be, if it <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy</hi> not that Christ, who was now speaking to his Apostles; and such are many that are gone abroad into the World. But what shall this <hi>spirit</hi> doe, that Christ may be glorified, <hi>He shall</hi> (saith he) <hi>take of mine,</hi>

                  </gap>; what these things are, is declared in the next verse; <hi>all things that the Father hath are mine,</hi> therefore <hi>I said, he shall take of mine.</hi> It is not of the <hi>Essence,</hi> and essentiall properties of the Father and Son, that our Saviour speaks; but of the <hi>Grace</hi> which is communicated to us by them. This Christ calls <hi>my things,</hi> being the fruit of his <hi>purchase</hi> and mediation: on which account he saith, all his <hi>Fathers things are his;</hi> that is, the things that the Father in his <hi>Eternall love,</hi> hath provided to be <hi>dispensed</hi> in the blood of his Sonne, all the fruits of Election: these, said he, the <hi>comforter</hi> shall receive: that is they shall be committed unto him, to dispose for your <hi>good,</hi> and advantage, to the end before proposed.

                  </gap>, He shall <hi>shew</hi> or declare, and make them known to you. Thus then is he a <hi>Comforter.</hi> He reveales to the soules of <hi>Believers,</hi> the good things of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace, which the Father hath <hi>provided,</hi> and the Sonne <hi>purchased.</hi> He shews to us

These things, I say, he effectually declares to the <hi>soules</hi> of Believers; and makes them know them for their own good: know them as <hi>originally</hi> the things of the Father, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from eternity in his Love and Good-will; as purchased for them by Christ, and laid up in store in the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace, for theiruse. Then is Christ magnified and <hi>glorified</hi> in their hearts: then they know what a <hi>Saviour</hi> and Redeemer he is.

               <p n="3">3. He <hi>sheds abroad the Love of God in our hearts,</hi> Rom. 5. 5. That <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>8</label> it is the <hi>Love of God</hi> to us, not our <hi>Love</hi> to God, which is here intended, the <hi>context</hi> is so cleare, as nothing can be added there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: now the Love of God is either of <hi>Ordination</hi> or of <hi>Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:</hi> The love of his <hi>purpose</hi> to doe us good, or the Love of Acceptation, and approbation with him, both these are called the <hi>Love of God</hi> frequently in Scripture, as I have declared. Now how can <hi>these</hi> be shed abroad in our hearts? not in <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> but in a <hi>sense</hi> of them; in a spirituall <hi>apprehension</hi> of them; <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, is <hi>shed abroad,</hi> the same word that is used concerning the <hi>Comforter</hi> being given us, Titus 2. 6. God <hi>sheds him</hi> abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, or powers him on us; so He <hi>sheds</hi> abroad, or <hi>powres out</hi> the Love of God in our hearts. Not to insist on the expression, which is <hi>Metaphoricall;</hi> the businesse is, that the <hi>Comforter</hi> gives a <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>plentifull</hi> Evidence and perswasion of the Love of God to us, such as the soule is <hi>taken,</hi> delighted, <hi>satiated</hi> withall. This is his work, and he doth it <hi>effectually.</hi> To give a poore sinfull soule a <hi>comfortable perswasion,</hi> affecting it throughout, in all its faculties and affections, that God in Jesus Christ <hi>loves him,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in him, is well pleased with him, hath thoughts of <hi>tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> and kindnesse towards him; to give, I say, a soule an <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing sence</hi> hereof, is an unexpressible mercy.</p>
               <p>This we have in a <hi>peculiar</hi> manner by the H. Gh: it is his proper work: as all his works, are works of Love and kindnes, so this of <label type="milestone">

Thus is it also in respect of the Sonne; in his taking of <hi>His,</hi> and <hi>showing</hi> of it unto us, as was declared.

                  <hi>bears witnesse with our spirits, that we are the Children of God.</hi> You know whose Children we are by nature; <hi>children of Satan,</hi> and of the curse, or of wrath. By the <hi>Spirit</hi> we are put into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>capacity,</hi> and are <hi>Adopted</hi> to be the children of God, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as by receiving the <hi>spirit</hi> of our <hi>Father,</hi> we become the <hi>children</hi> of our Father. Thence is he called v. 15. the <hi>Spirit of Adoption.</hi> Now sometimes the soule, because it hath somewhat remaining in it, of the <hi>principle</hi> that it had in its old condition, is put to Question, whether it be a child of <hi>God</hi> or no, and thereupon as in a thing of the greatest importance, puts in its claime, with all the <hi>Evidences</hi> that it hath, to make good its Title. The spirit <hi>comes</hi> and beares witnesse in this <hi>case.</hi> An al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion it is to <hi>judiciall proceedings</hi> in point of Titles and Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The <hi>Judge</hi> being set, the <hi>person</hi> concerned layes his <hi>claime,</hi> produceth his <hi>Evidences</hi> and pleads them; his Adversaries en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring all that in them lies, to <hi>invalidate</hi> them, and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null his <hi>plea,</hi> and to cast him in his claime: In the middest of the <hi>triall,</hi> a person of known and approved <hi>integrity</hi> comes into the <hi>Court,</hi> and gives <hi>Testimony</hi> fully and directly on the behalfe of the <hi>claimer,</hi> which stops the mouthes of all his Adversaries, and filles the man that <hi>pleaded,</hi> with joy and satisfaction. So is it in this case. The <hi>soule</hi> by the power of its own <hi>Conscience,</hi> is brought before the <hi>Law</hi> of God: there a man puts in his plea, that He is a <hi>Child</hi> of God, that he belongs to <hi>Gods family,</hi> and for this end produceth all his <hi>Evidences,</hi> every thing, whereby Faith gives him an interest in God. Satan in the mean time <hi>opposeth</hi> with all his might; <hi>sinne</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> assist him: many
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:60108:143"/>
                  <hi>flawes</hi> are found in his Evidences; the Truth of them all is que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned, and the soule <hi>hangs</hi> in suspence as to the <hi>issue.</hi> In the middest of the <hi>plea</hi> and contest, the <hi>Comforter</hi> comes; and by a word of promise; or otherwise, overpowers the <hi>heart</hi> with a comfortable <hi>perswasion,</hi> (and bears downe all <hi>objections)</hi> that his <hi>plea</hi> is good and that he is a child of God. And therefore it is said of him, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: When our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are <hi>pleading</hi> their <hi>Right</hi> and Title, He comes in and <hi>bears witnesse</hi> on our side: at the same time, enabling us to put forth acts of filiall obedience; kind and Child like, which is called <hi>crying Abba father.</hi> Remember still the <hi>manner</hi> of the Spirit's working before mentioned; that he doth it <hi>effectually, voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 6.</note> and <hi>freely.</hi> Hence sometimes the dispute hangs long; the cause is pleading many years: The Law seems sometimes to prevaile; sin and Satan to rejoyce; and the poor soule is filled with dread about its <hi>inheritance,</hi> perhaps its own <hi>witnesse,</hi> from its Faith, Sanctification, former experience, keeps up the plea with some life and comfort; but the work is not done, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest is not fully obtained, untill the <hi>Spirit</hi> who worketh free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and effectually, when and how he will, comes in with his <hi>Testimony</hi> also: cloathing his power with a word of promise, he makes all parties concerned to attend unto him, and puts an end to the Controversy.</p>
               <p>Herein he gives us holy <hi>Communion</hi> with himselfe. The soule knows his voyce when he speaks: <hi>nec hominem sonat.</hi> There is something too great in it, to be the Effect of a created power. When the Lord Jesus Christ, at one word stilled the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Sea and Wind, all that were with him, knew there was <hi>Divine power</hi> at hand: Math. 4. 39. And when the Holy Ghost by one word stills the tumults and stormes that are raised in the Soule, giving it an immediate calme and security, it knows his divine power, and rejoyces in his presence.</p>

               <list>
                  <item>1. The <hi>nature</hi> of it.</item>
                  <item>2. The <hi>use of it.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>The nature of sealing consists in the imparting of the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:60108:143"/>
                  <hi>image</hi> or <hi>character</hi> of the seale to the thing sealed; This is to <hi>seale</hi> a thing; to stampe the character of the <hi>seale</hi> on it. In this sense the effectuall Communication of the image of God unto us, should be our <hi>sealing.</hi> The Spirit on Believers really communicating the <hi>image</hi> of God in Righteousnesse and true Holinesse unto the Soule, sealeth us. To have this <hi>stamp</hi> of the Holy Ghost, so as to be an evidence unto the soul that it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with God, is to be <hi>sealed</hi> by the spirit; taking the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor</hi> from the nature of sealing. And in this sense is our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <note place="margin">Mich. 5. 4.</note> said to be <hi>sealed</hi> of God: Joh. 6. 27. even from that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the power, wisedome and <hi>majesty</hi> of God that he had upon him in the discharge of his Office.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The End of <hi>sealing</hi> is twofold. 1. To <hi>confirme</hi> or <hi>ratify</hi> any grant or conveiance made in writing; In such cases men <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>12</label> set their <hi>seales</hi> to make good and confirme their grants, and when this is done they are irrevocable. Or to confirme the testimony that is given by any one of the truth of any thing. Such was the manner among the Jewes: when any one had given true witnesse unto any thing or matter, and it was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Judges; they instantly set their seales to it, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it in Judgement. Hence is it said, that <hi>he who receives the Testimony of Christ,</hi> sets to his <hi>seale</hi> that God is true Joh 3. 33, The promise is the great grant and <hi>conveiance</hi> of life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in Christ to the soules of Believers. That we may have full assurance of the truth and irrevocablenesse of the promise, God gives us the Spirit to <hi>satisfy</hi> our hearts of it; and thence is he said to <hi>seale</hi> us; by Assuring our <hi>hearts</hi> of those promises, and their <hi>stability.</hi> But though many Expositors goe this way, I doe not see how this can consist with the very meaning of the word: It is not said that the promise is <hi>sealed,</hi> but that we are sealed, and when we seale a <hi>deed</hi> or grant to any one, we doe not say the <hi>man</hi> is sealed, but the <hi>deed</hi> or grant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To <hi>appropriate,</hi> distinguish or keep safe; this is the end of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>13</label> 
                  <hi>fealing;</hi> men set their seales on that, which they <hi>appropriate,</hi> and desire to keep <hi>safe</hi> for themselves: so evidently in this sence, are the servants of God said to be <hi>sealed</hi> Revel. 7. 4. that is, <hi>marked</hi> with Gods marke, as his peculiar ones, for this sealing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to the setting of a <hi>mark</hi> Ezek. 9. Then are Believers <hi>sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> when they are marked for God, to be heires of the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:60108:144"/>
inheritance, and to be preserved to the day of <hi>Redemption.</hi> Now if this be the <hi>sealing</hi> intended, it denotes not an act of sense in the heart but of security to the person: The Father gives the Elect into the hands of Christ to be redeemed: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving redeemed them in due time, they are called by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and marked for God, and so give up themselves to the hands of the Father.</p>
               <p>If you aske now which of these <hi>senses</hi> is chiefly intended in this expression of our being <hi>sealed</hi> by the Holy Ghost; I answer the <hi>first,</hi> not excluding the other; we are sealed to the Day of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> when from the <hi>stamp, image,</hi> and <hi>Character</hi> of the Spirit upon our soules, we have a <hi>fresh</hi> sence of the <hi>love</hi> of God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us with a <hi>comfortable</hi> perswasion of our acceptation with <note place="margin">Pers. of Saints cap.</note> him. But of this whole matter I have treated at large else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
               <p>Thus then the Holy Ghost communicates unto us his own <hi>likenesse,</hi> which is also the image of the Father and the Sonne. <hi>We are changed into this image by the Lord the Spirit:</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18. And herein he brings us into fellowship with himselfe. Our likenesse to him, gives us boldnesse with him: His <hi>worke</hi> we look for, his <hi>fruits</hi> we pray for; and when any effect of Grace, any discovery of the <hi>image</hi> of Christ implanted in us, gives us a perswasion of our being separated and set apart for God, we have a Communion with him therein.</p>

That it be a <hi>confirmation</hi> of a promise and appointment; first the <hi>whole</hi> is promised then the <hi>earnest</hi> is given for the <hi>good</hi> and true perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of that promise.</p>
               <p>Thus the Spirit is this <hi>Earnest</hi> God gives us the promise of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>18</label> 
                  <hi>eternall life.</hi> To confirme this to us, he giveth us his Spirit, which is as the first part of the promise, to secure us of the <hi>whole.</hi> Hence he is said to be the <hi>earnest</hi> of the <hi>inheritance</hi> that is promised, and purchased. And it may be considered how it may, be said to be an <hi>Earnest</hi> on the part of God, who gives him, and on the <hi>part</hi> of <hi>Believers</hi> who receive him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He is an Earnest on the part of God, in that God gives <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>19</label>

him as a <hi>choyce</hi> part of the Inheritance it selfe; and of the <hi>same kind</hi> with the <hi>whole,</hi> as an <hi>Earnest</hi> ought to be. The full <hi>inheritance</hi> promised, is the <hi>fullnesse</hi> of the Spirit in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. When that Spirit which is given us in this world shall have perfectly taken away all <hi>sinne,</hi> and sorrow, and shall have made us <hi>able</hi> to enjoy the <hi>Glory</hi> of God in his presence, that is the <hi>fullinheritance</hi> promised. So that the <hi>Spirit</hi> given us for the fitting of us for enjoyment of God in some measure, whilst we are here, is the earnest of the whole.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God doth it to this <hi>purpose,</hi> to assure us and secure us of the <hi>inheritance;</hi> having given us so many securityes <hi>without</hi> us, his Word, Promises, Covenant, Oath, the Revelation and discovery of his <hi>faithfullnesse,</hi> and immutability in them all: he is pleased also graciously to give us one <hi>within</hi> us; (Isa. 59. 21.) <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 17, 18</note> that we may have all the security, we are capable of: What can more be done? He hath given us of the <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> in him the first fruits of Glory, the utmost pledge of his Love; the Earnest of all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. On the <hi>part of Believers,</hi> He is an earnest, in that he gives them an <hi>Acquaintance</hi> with, 1. The <hi>love of God;</hi> their Acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>20</label> with him makes known to them their <hi>favour</hi> in his sight: that he is their <hi>Father</hi> and will deale with them as with chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and consequently that the inheritance shall be theirs. He sends his Spirit into our hearts <hi>cryinb ba Father.</hi> Gal. 4. 6. and what is the <hi>inference</hi> of Believers from hence, (v. 7) <hi>then we are not servants, but sons, and if sons, then heires of God:</hi> the same Apostle againe Rom. 8. 17) <hi>If children then heires of God and joynt heires with Christ.</hi> On that perswasion of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that we are <hi>children,</hi> the inference is, then <hi>heires, heires</hi> of God, and joynt heires with Christ: We have then a right to an <hi>inheritance</hi> and an eviction of it. This is the <hi>use</hi> then we have of it; even the Spirit perswading us of our <hi>sonship,</hi> and acceptation with God our Father. And what is this <hi>inheritance of Glory?</hi> if we <hi>suffer with him,</hi> we shall be <hi>glorifyed together.</hi> And that the Spirit is given for this <hi>end</hi> is attested 1 Joh. 3. 24.) <hi>Hereby we know, that he abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.</hi> The Apostle is spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of our <hi>Union</hi> with God, which he expresseth in the words foregoing. <hi>He that keepeth his Commandements dwelleth in him, and</hi>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:60108:145"/>
                  <hi>he in him.</hi> Of that <hi>Union</hi> elsewhere: now this we know from <hi>hence,</hi> even by the Spirit which he hath given us. The Spirit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us with it: not that we have such an acquaintance, but that the Argument is good and <hi>conclusive</hi> in it selfe; we <hi>have of the Spirit,</hi> therefore <hi>he dwells in us, and we in him;</hi> because in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his <hi>dwelling in us,</hi> is by that <hi>Spirit,</hi> and our interest in him is from <hi>thence;</hi> a sense of this he giveth as he pleaseth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirit being given as an <hi>Earnest,</hi> acquaints Believers <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>21</label> with their inheritance (1 Cor. 2. 9. 10.) As an <hi>Earnest</hi> being part of the <hi>whole,</hi> gives knowledge of it, so doth the Spirit as in sundry particulars might be demonstrated.</p>
               <p>So is he in all respects compleatly an <hi>Earnest:</hi> Given of God, received by us, as the beginning of our inheritance, and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>22</label> the <hi>Assurance</hi> of it. So much as we have of the spirit, so much we have of Heaven, in perfect enjoyment, and so much evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of its future fullnesse. Under this apprehension of him in the dispensation of Grace, do Believers receive him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in him: Every gracious <hi>selfe evidencing</hi> act of his in their hearts, they rejoyce in, as a <hi>drop</hi> from Heaven; and long for the <hi>Ocean</hi> of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Not to drive every effect of grace to this issue, to neglect the worke of the Holy Ghost in us, and towards us.</p>
               <p>There remaines only that a difference be in a few words assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned between Believers receiving the Spirit, 'as an <hi>Earnest</hi> of the whole inheritance; and <hi>hypocrits, tasting</hi> of the <hi>powers of the world to come</hi> Heb. 5. 6. A <hi>test</hi> of the powers of the world to come, seems to be the same with the <hi>earnest of the inheritance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But (1.) that by the <hi>powers of the world to come</hi> in that place, is intended the <hi>joys of Heaven,</hi> there is indeed no ground to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine: they are nowhere so called; nor doth it suitably <hi>expresse</hi> the glory that shall be revealed, which we shall be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of. It is doubtlesse the <hi>powerfull Ministry</hi> of the Ordinances &amp; dispensations of the times of the <hi>Gospell</hi> (there, called to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> according their own <hi>idiome)</hi> the powers or greate effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall things of the <hi>world to come;</hi> that is intended: but</p>
               <p n="2">2. Suppose that by the <hi>powers of the world to come</hi> the Glory of Heaven is intended; there is a wide difference between ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a <hi>vanishing</hi> tast of it our selves, and receiving an <hi>abiding earnest</hi> from God: To take a <hi>tast</hi> of the things of Heaven, and to

have them <hi>assured</hi> of God, as from his Love differ greatly. An <hi>Hypocrite</hi> may have his thoughts raysed to a great deale of <hi>Joy</hi> and contentment in the consideration of the good things of the Kingdome of God for a season, considering the things in themselves, but the Spirit as he is an <hi>Earnest</hi> gives us a pleadge of them as provided for us in the <hi>Love</hi> of God and purchase of his Sonne Jesus Christ. This by the way.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Spirit <hi>anoynts</hi> Believers. <hi>We are anoynted by the Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. <label type="milestone">

               <p>I shall only therefore fix on <hi>one</hi> place, where the <hi>Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the spirit in this unction of Christ are <hi>enumerated,</hi> of <label type="milestone">

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:60108:146"/>
Principally those of <hi>Wisdome, Councell,</hi> and <hi>Understanding,</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on: on the Account whereof, all the <hi>Treasures of Wisdome and Knowledge are said to be in him,</hi> Col. 2. 3. and though this be but some part of the <hi>furniture</hi> of Jesus Christ, for the discharge of his Office, yet it is such, as where our <hi>anoynting</hi> to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is mentioned, it is said peculiarly on the effecting of such <hi>Qualifications</hi> as these; so John 2. 22, and 27. the work of the <hi>anoynting,</hi> is to <hi>teach</hi> us. The Spirit therein, is a <hi>Spirit of Wisdome</hi> and <hi>understanding</hi> of <hi>Councell,</hi> Knowledge and <hi>quick understanding</hi> in the feare of the Lord. So was the great promise of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter,</hi> that he should <hi>teach us,</hi> Joh. 14. 26. that he should <hi>guide us</hi> into all truth; Chap. 16. 13. This of <hi>teaching us</hi> the mind and will of God, in the manner wherein we are taught it by the Spirit, our <hi>Comforter,</hi> is an eminent part of our <hi>unction</hi> by him, which only I shall instance in. Give me leave to say there is a threefold <hi>teaching</hi> by the spirit.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>teaching</hi> by the Spirit of <hi>Conviction</hi> and illumination; so the Spirit teacheth the <hi>world,</hi> that is, many in it, by the <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the Word, as he is promised to doe, Joh. 16. 8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A teaching by the spirit of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> opening <hi>blind eyes,</hi> giving a new <hi>understanding</hi> shining into our hearts, to give us a knowledge of the <hi>Glory</hi> of God, in the face of Jesus Christ, enableing us to receive <hi>Spirituall</hi> things in a <hi>Spirituall light.</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 8. giving a <hi>saving knowledge</hi> of the <hi>mistery</hi> of the Gospell; and this in severall degrees is <hi>common</hi> to all Believers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A <hi>teaching</hi> by the <hi>Spirit of Consolation,</hi> making <hi>sweet, usefull,</hi> and joyfull to the soule the discoveries that are made of the mind and Will of God in the light of the Spirit of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Here the oyle of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is called the <hi>Oyle of gladnesse</hi> That which beings <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Gladnesse</hi> with it; And the name of Christ hereby discovered, is a <hi>sweet oyntment powred forth,</hi> that causeth Soules to runne after him with joy and delight, Cant. 1. 2. We see it by daily <hi>experience,</hi> that very many have little tast and sweetnesse and relish in their Soules of those <hi>Truths,</hi> which yet they savingly know and believe: But when we are taught by this <hi>unction,</hi> oh how <hi>sweet</hi> is every thing we know of God? As we may see in the place of <hi>Iohn,</hi> where mention is made of the <hi>teaching</hi> of this <hi>unction,</hi> it respects peculiarly, the Spirit teaching of us the <hi>Love</hi> of God in Christ, the <hi>shining of</hi>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:60108:147"/>
                  <hi>his Countenance,</hi> which as <hi>David</hi> speaks, puts Gladnesse into our hearts, Psal. 4. 6, 7.</p>
               <p>We have this then by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> he teacheth us of the <hi>Love</hi> of God in Christ, he makes every <hi>Gospell Truth</hi> as <hi>wine</hi> well refined <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>25</label> to our Soules, and the good things of it, to be a <hi>feast</hi> of <hi>fatt things:</hi> gives us <hi>Joy</hi> and gladnesse of heart with all that wee <hi>know</hi> of God, which is the great preservative of the <hi>Soule</hi> to keep it close to Truth. The Apostle speaks of our teaching by this <hi>unction,</hi> as the meanes whereby we are preserved from <hi>seduction.</hi> Indeed to know any Truth in the Power, <hi>sweetnesse, Joy,</hi> &amp; <hi>Gladnesse</hi> of it, is that great <hi>security</hi> of the soules constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the preservation and retaining of it. They will readily change <hi>Truth</hi> for Error, who find no more <hi>sweetnesse</hi> in the <hi>one</hi> then in the other. I must crave the Readers pardon, for my briefe passing over these great things of the Gospell: my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent designe is rather to <hi>enumerate,</hi> then to <hi>unfold</hi> them. This one work of the Holy Ghost might it be pursued, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a <hi>fuller</hi> discourse then I can allot unto the whole matter in hand. All the <hi>priviledges</hi> we enjoy, all the <hi>Dignity</hi> and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour we are invested withall, our whole dedication unto God, our Nobility and Royalty, our interest in all Church advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and approaches to God in worship, our separation from the world, the <hi>name</hi> whereby we are called, the liberty we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, all flow from this head, are all branches of this effect of the Holy Ghost. I have mentioned only our <hi>teaching</hi> by this unction: a <hi>Teaching</hi> that brings joy and gladnesse with it, by giving the heart a <hi>sense</hi> of the Truth wherein we are instructed. When we find any of the good Truths of the Gospell come home to our soules, with life, vigour, and power; giving us gladnesse of heart, <hi>transforming</hi> us into the image and likenesse of it, the Holy Ghost is then at his work; is powring out of his oyle.</p>
               <p>We have Adoption also by the Spirit, hence he is called the <hi>Spirit of Adoption:</hi> that is either, he who is <hi>given to Adopted ones,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>26</label> to secure them of it, to beget in their hearts a sense and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion</hi> of the Fathers Adopting Love; or else to give them the <hi>priviledge</hi> it selfe, as is intimated Joh. 1. 12. Neither is that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite hereunto which we have, Gal. 4, 6. for God may send the <hi>spirit of supplication</hi> into our hearts, because we are <hi>Sons,</hi> and

yet <hi>Adopted</hi> by his spirit. But of this elsewhere.</p>
               <p>He is also called the <hi>Spirit of Supplication,</hi> under which notion he is promised, Zach. 12. 10. and how he affects that in us, is <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>27</label> declared, Rom. 8. 26. 27. and Gal: 4. 6. and we are thence said <hi>to pray in the Holy Ghost.</hi> Our prayers may be considered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Two waies.</hi> First as a <hi>spirituall Duty</hi> required of us by God; and so they are wrought in us by the <hi>Spirit of Sanctification,</hi> which helps us to <hi>performe</hi> all our duties, by exalting all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Soule for the Spirituall discharge of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective offices in them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As a <hi>meanes of retaining Communion</hi> with God, whereby we sweetly ease our hearts in the bosome of the Father, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in refreshing tasts of his <hi>Love.</hi> The Soule is never more <hi>raysed</hi> with the <hi>Love</hi> of God, then when by the <hi>Spirit</hi> taken into intimate communion with him, in the discharge of this <hi>duty:</hi> and therein it belongs to the <hi>Spirit of Consolation,</hi> to the Spirit promised as a <hi>Comforter.</hi> And this is the next thing to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in our Communion with the Holy Ghost: namely what are the peculiar <hi>Effects</hi> which he worketh in us, and towards us, being so bestowed on us, as was declared, and <hi>working</hi> in the way and manner insisted on. Now these are, His <hi>bringing</hi> the promises of Christ to <hi>remembrance, glorifying</hi> him in our hearts, <hi>shedding</hi> abroad the <hi>love</hi> of God in us, <hi>witnessing</hi> with us, as to our spirituall estate and condition, <hi>sealing</hi> us to the day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; being the <hi>earnest</hi> of our Inheritance, <hi>anoynting</hi> us with priviledges as to their consolation, confirming our <hi>Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and being present with us in our <hi>supplications.</hi> Here is the wisdome of Faith; to find out, and meet with the <hi>Comforter</hi> in all these things: not to loose their sweetnesse, by lying in the dark to their Author; nor coming short of the Returnes which are required of us.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Consolation</hi> is the first of these. The <hi>Disciples walked in the feare of the Lord, and in the Consolation of the Holy Ghost,</hi> Acts 9, 31. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, from his <hi>worke</hi> towards us, and in us, we have <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> and <hi>Consolation.</hi> This is the first generall consequent of his dispensation and work. When ever there is mention made of <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Consolation</hi> in the Scripture given to the Saints, (as there is most frequently,) it is the proper consequent of the work of the Holy Ghost towards them. <hi>Comfort</hi> or <hi>Consolation</hi> in generall, is the setting and composing of the Soule in rest and contentednesse, in the middest <hi>of,</hi> or from troubles, by the consideration, or <hi>presence,</hi> of some good wherein it is interested, outweighing the <hi>Evill, trouble,</hi> or perplexity that it hath to wrestle withall. Where mention is made of <hi>Comfort</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation properly so called, there is relation to <hi>trouble</hi> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity; so the Apostle, 1 Cor. 1. 5, 6. <hi>As the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our Consolation also aboundeth by Christ. Suffering</hi> and <hi>Consolation</hi> are opposed; the <hi>latter</hi> being a reliefe against the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;</hi> so are all the promises of <hi>Comfort,</hi> and all the expressions of it in the Old and New Testament, still proposed as <hi>relieses</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Trouble.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:60108:148"/>
And (as I said) <hi>Consolation</hi> ariseth from the <hi>presence</hi> or consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>3</label> of a <hi>greater Good,</hi> that outballances the <hi>evill,</hi> or <hi>perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> where with we are to contend. Now in the <hi>Effects</hi> or acts of the Holy Ghost before mentioned, lye all the springs of our <hi>consolation.</hi> There is no <hi>comfort</hi> but from them. And there is no <hi>trouble,</hi> that we may not have comfort in, and against, by them. That a man may have <hi>consolation</hi> in any condition, nothing is required, but the <hi>presence</hi> of a good, rendring the evill, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he is <hi>pressed,</hi> inconsiderable to him. Suppose a man under the greatest <hi>calamity</hi> that can possibly <hi>befall</hi> a child of God, or a confluence of all those evills numbred by <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 8. 38, &amp;c. Let this man have the Holy Ghost, performing the works <hi>mentioned</hi> before toward him, and in despight of all his evill, his Consolations will abound. Suppose him to have a sence of the <hi>Love of God</hi> all the while shed abroad in his heart, a cleare witnesse within that he is a <hi>child</hi> of God, accepted with him, that he is <hi>sealed</hi> and <hi>marked</hi> of God for his own, that he is an <hi>heire</hi> of all the promises of God, and the like, it is impossible that man should not <hi>triumph</hi> in all his tribulations.</p>
               <p>From this Rise of all our Consolation, are those descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>4</label> which we have of it in the Scripture, from its properties and adjuncts: As first, it is <hi>abiding,</hi> thence it is called <hi>everlasting consolation,</hi> 2 Thes. 2. 16. God our Father, which hath loved us, &amp; given us <hi>everlasting consolation;</hi> that is, Comfort, that <hi>vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth</hi> not; and that because it riseth from everlasting things. There may be some <hi>perishing Comfort</hi> given for a little season, by <hi>perishing</hi> things: but <hi>abiding consolation,</hi> which we have by the Holy Ghost, is from things <hi>everlasting. Everlasting</hi> Love, <hi>eternall</hi> Redemption, an <hi>everlasting</hi> inheritance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Strong.</hi> Heb. 6. 18. <hi>That the heirs of the Promise should receive strong Consolation.</hi> As <hi>Strong opposition</hi> lies sometimes against us, and trouble, whose <hi>bands</hi> are strong, so is our consolation <hi>strong;</hi> it abounds, and is unconquerable. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: it is such, as will make its way through all <hi>opposition,</hi> it <hi>confirmes, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborates,,</hi> and strengthens the heart under any evill, it fortifies the soule, and makes it able <hi>cheerfully</hi> to undergoe any thing that it is called unto, and that because it is from him who is strong.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is <hi>Precious.</hi> Hence the Apostle makes it the great <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:60108:149"/>
unto obedience, which he exhorts the <hi>Philipians</hi> unto, cap. 2. 1. <hi>If there be any consolation in Christ:</hi> if you set any <hi>esteeme</hi> and <hi>valuation</hi> upon this <hi>precious</hi> mercy of consolation in Christ; by <hi>those comforts,</hi> let it be so with you.</p>
               <p>And this is the first generall <hi>consequent</hi> in the hearts of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, of those great <hi>Effects</hi> of the Holy Ghost before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>5</label> now this is so large and comprehensive, comprizing so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our concernments in our walking with God, that the Holy Ghost receives his <hi>denomination,</hi> as to the whole work he hath to performe for us from hence; He is the <hi>Comforter;</hi> as Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, from the work of <hi>Redemption</hi> and salvation, is the <hi>Redeemer</hi> and <hi>Saviour</hi> of his Church. Now as we have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation but from the Holy Ghost: so all his <hi>Effects</hi> towards us, have certainly this <hi>consequent</hi> more, or lesse, in us. Yea I dare say; whatever we have in the kinds of the things before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that brings not <hi>consolation</hi> with it, in the <hi>root</hi> at least, if not in the ripe fruit, is not of the Holy Ghost. The way whereby comfort issues out from those works of his, belongs to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular cases. The fellowship we have with him, consists, in no small portion of it, in the consolation we receive from him. This gives us a valuation of his Love; teacheth whether to make applications in our distresse; whom to pray for, to pray to, whom to wait upon in perplexities.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Peace</hi> ariseth hence also, Rom. 15. 13. <hi>The God of hope fill</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>you with all peace in believing, that you may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghost.</hi> The power of the Holy Ghost, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extended to <hi>hope,</hi> but to our <hi>peace</hi> also in believing. So is it in the connexion of those promises, Joh. 14. 26, 27. <hi>I will give you the Comforter:</hi> and what then? what followes that grant? <hi>Peace,</hi> saith he, <hi>I leave with you,</hi> my <hi>peace I give unto you.</hi> Nor doth Christ otherwise leave <hi>his peace,</hi> or give <hi>his peace</hi> unto them, but by bestowing the <hi>comforter</hi> on them. The peace of Christ, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the soules sense of its <hi>Acceptation</hi> with God in <hi>friendship.</hi> So is Christ said to be our <hi>Peace,</hi> Eph. 2. 14. by slaying the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity between God and us, and in taking away the <hi>handwriting,</hi> that was against us, Rom. 5. 1. <hi>being justified by Faith, we have Peace with God.</hi> A comfortable perswasion of our Acceptation with God in Christ, is the bottome of this <hi>peace,</hi> it enwrapps
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:60108:149"/>
deliverance from <hi>Eternall</hi> wrath, hatred, curse, condemnation; all sweetly affecting the soule and conscience.</p>
               <p>And this is a <hi>Branch</hi> from the same <hi>Root</hi> with that foregoing. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>7</label> A <hi>consequent</hi> of the Effects of the Holy Ghost before mentioned. Suppose a man chosen in the eternall <hi>Love</hi> of the Father, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by the <hi>blood</hi> of the Son; and justified freely by the <hi>Grace</hi> of God, so that he hath a <hi>right</hi> to all the promises of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell; yet this person can by no reasonings nor arguings of his own heart, by no considerations of the promises themselves, nor of the <hi>Love</hi> of God, or <hi>Grace</hi> of Christ in them, be brought to any establishment in <hi>peace,</hi> untill it be produced in him, as a fruit and consequent of the work of the Holy Ghost in him, and towards him. <hi>Peace</hi> is the fruit of the spirit, Gal. 5. 22. The savour of the spirit is life and <hi>Peace,</hi> Rom. 8. 6. All we have is from him, and by him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Joy</hi> also is of this number. The <hi>Spirit</hi> as was shewed, is <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>8</label> called the <hi>Oyle of Gladnesse,</hi> Heb. 1. 10. his anointing brings <hi>Gladnesse</hi> with it, Isa. 61. 3. the <hi>oyle of joy for mourning.</hi> The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God is <hi>righteousnesse, Peace,</hi> and <hi>joy</hi> in the Holy Ghost, Rom. 14. 17. 1 Thes. 1. 6. Received the <hi>Gospel, with joy in the Holy Ghost. with joy,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> tells believers, <hi>unspeakable, and full of glory.</hi> 1 Pet 1. 8. To give <hi>joy</hi> to the hearts of Believers, is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently the work of the <hi>Comforter,</hi> &amp; this he doth by the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars before instanced in; that <hi>rejoycing</hi> in hope of the Glory of God, mentioned Rom. 5. 2. which carries the Soule through any <hi>Tribulation</hi> even with <hi>glorying,</hi> hath its rise in the Spirits <hi>shedding abroad the love of God in our hearts,</hi> v 5. Now there are <hi>two</hi> wayes, whereby the Spirit worketh this <hi>joy</hi> in the hearts of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He doth it <hi>immediately</hi> by himselfe; without the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any other Acts, or works of his, or the interposition of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>9</label> any <hi>reasonings,</hi> or <hi>deductions,</hi> and <hi>conclusions;</hi> As in <hi>sanctification,</hi> He is a well of water <hi>springing up in the Soule,</hi> immediately exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <hi>efficacy,</hi> and refreshment: so in <hi>Consolation,</hi> He <hi>Immediately</hi> works the <hi>soule,</hi> and <hi>minds</hi> of men to a <hi>joyfull</hi> rejoycing, and <hi>spirituall frame,</hi> filling them with <hi>Exultation</hi> and <hi>gladnesse;</hi> not that this arises from our reflex <hi>consideration</hi> of the <hi>Love</hi> of God; but rather gives <hi>occasion</hi> thereunto: When he so <hi>sheds</hi> abroad the love of God in our hearts, and so <hi>filling</hi> them with gladnesse by
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:60108:150"/>
an <hi>immediate</hi> act and operation (as he caused <hi>John Baptist,</hi> to leap for joy in the womb, upon the approach of the mother of <hi>Jesus.)</hi> Then doth the <hi>Soule</hi> even from hence, raise it selfe to a consideration of the <hi>Love</hi> of God, whence joy and rejoycing doth also flow. Of this <hi>joy</hi> there is no account to be <hi>given,</hi> but that the <hi>spirit</hi> worketh it, when, and how he <hi>will;</hi> he secretly <hi>infuseth,</hi> and <hi>distills</hi> it into the soule, prevailing against all <hi>feares,</hi> and <hi>sorrowes,</hi> filling it with gladnesse, exultations, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with unspeakable raptures of mind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Mediately</hi> by his other workes towards us. He gives a <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>10</label> sense of the love of God, with our <hi>Adoption</hi> and acceptation with him: and on the consideration thereof, enables us to re-receive it. Let what hath been spoken of his operations towards us be considered, what Assurance he gives us of the <hi>Love</hi> of God, what <hi>life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> power,</hi> and security, what pledge of our eternall welfare, and it will be easily perceived, that he lays a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent foundation of this <hi>Joy,</hi> and gladnesse: not that we are able upon any rationall <hi>consideration,</hi> deduction, or conclusion, that we can make from the things mentioned, to affect our hearts with the <hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>gladnesse</hi> intended: it is left no lesse the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per worke of the Spirit to doe it from hence and by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of these considerations, then to doe it <hi>immediately</hi> without them. This processe of producing <hi>joy</hi> in the heart we have. Psal. 23. 5, 6. <hi>Thou annoyntest my head with oyle.</hi> Hence is the conclusion, as in the way of exultation, <hi>surely goodnesse and mercy shall follow me.</hi> Of this effect of the Comforter see Isai. 35. throughout.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Hope</hi> also is an <hi>effect</hi> of those workings of the Holy Ghost in us, and towards us. Rom. 15. 13. These I say are the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <label type="milestone">

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>1</label> how we hold the communion proposed with the Holy Ghost, in the things laid down, and manifested to containe his peculiar worke towards us.

               <p n="1">1. Take a view then of the state and condition of them <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>2</label> who professing to believe the <hi>Gospell</hi> of Jesus Christ, do yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne and despise his spirit as to all its operations, Gifts, Graces and dispensations to his <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Saints.</hi> Whilst Christ was in the <hi>World</hi> with his disciples, he made them no <hi>greater promise,</hi> neither in respect of their <hi>own good,</hi> nor of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the worke which he had committed to them, then <hi>this</hi> of giving them the holy Ghost. <hi>Him,</hi> he instructeth them to pray for of the <hi>Father,</hi> as that which is needfull for them, as <hi>bread</hi> for children Luke 11. 13. Him he promiseth them, as a well of water springing up in them, for their refreshment <hi>strengthning</hi> and consolation, unto everlasting life: John 7. 37, 38, 39. As also to carry on, and accomplish the whole worke of the <hi>ministry</hi> to them committed: John 16. 8. 9, 10. with all those eminent workes and priviledges before mentioned. And upon his <hi>Ascension</hi> this is laid as the bottome of that glorious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of gifts and <hi>Graces</hi> in his plentifull effusion men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Ephes. 4. 8, 11. 12. namely, That he had <hi>received of the Father the Promise of the Holy Ghost:</hi> Act. 2. 33. and that in such an eminent manner, as thereby to make the greatest and most
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:60108:151"/>
glorious difference betwen the <hi>Administration</hi> of the new <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> and <hi>old. Especially</hi> doth the whole worke of the <hi>ministry</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the <hi>Holy</hi> Ghost; though that be not my present busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to evince. He calls men to that worke, and they are <hi>separated</hi> unto him, Act. 13. 2. He <hi>furnisheth</hi> them with gifts, and abilitys for that employment, 1 Cor. 12. 7, 8, 9, 10. Soc that the whole Religion we professe without this Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit, is nothing: nor is there any fruite without it of the Resurrection of Christ from the the dead.</p>
               <p>This being the state of things, that in our worship of, &amp; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God, in our own <hi>consolation,</hi> sanctification, and ministeriall employment, the Spirit being the Principle the <hi>life, soule,</hi> the <hi>all</hi> of the whole; yet so desperate hath been the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi> of Satan, and wickednesse of men; that their great endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour hath been, to shut him quite out of all <hi>Gospell administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First his <hi>Gifts</hi> and Graces were not only decryed, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most <hi>excluded</hi> from the publike worship of the Church, by the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>3</label> imposition of an <hi>operous forme</hi> of <hi>service,</hi> to be read by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster; which to doe, is neither a <hi>peculiar gift</hi> of the Holy Ghost to any; nor of the ministry at all. It is marvellous to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what pleas and pretences were <hi>invented,</hi> and used by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, from its <hi>Antiquity,</hi> its <hi>composure</hi> or approbation by <hi>Martyrs,</hi> the beauty of Uniformity in the worship of <hi>God</hi> esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, and pressed thereby &amp;c. for the defence and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of it. But the maine Argument they insisted on, and the chiefe <hi>field wherein</hi> they expatiated, and layd out all their Eloquence was, the vaine babling repetitions and folly of men <hi>praying</hi> by the <hi>Spirit.</hi> When once this was fallen upon, all (at least as they supposed) was <hi>carryed</hi> away before them, and their <hi>Adversaries</hi> rendred sufficiently ridiculous. So great is the <hi>cunning</hi> of Satan, and so unsearchable are the follys of the hearts of men. The summe of all these reasonings amount to no more but this: Though the Lord Jesus Christ hath promised the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> to be with his Church to the end of the world, to <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>furnish men</hi> with gifts and abilitys, for the carrying on of that worship which he requires, and accepteth at our hands, yet the worke is not done to the <hi>purpose;</hi> the gifts he bestows, are not sufficient to that end neither as to invocation, nor do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:60108:151"/>
&amp; therefore we will not only help men by our directions but exclude them from their <hi>exercise.</hi> This I say was the summe of all, as I could undeniably evidence. Were that my present busines. What innumerable evills ensue on this Principle, in a formall setting a part of men to the ministry, who had never once tasted of the <hi>powers of the world to come,</hi> nor received any gifts from the Holy Ghost to that purpose; of crying up, and growing in, an outside pompous worship, wholly forraign to the power and simplicity of the Gospell; of <hi>silencing,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying, banishing men, whose ministry was accompanyed with the evidence, and demonstration of the Spirit, I shall not need to declare. This is that I ayme at, to point out the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like contempt of the Holy Ghost; his <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>graces</hi> wtih their administration in the Church of God, that hath been found e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven where the <hi>Gospell</hi> hath been professed.</p>
               <p>Again, it is a thing of most sad consideration, once to call to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>4</label> mind, the improvement of that principle of contempt of the Spirit in private men, &amp; their ways. The name of the spirit was grown a terme of reproach. To <hi>plead</hi> for, or pretend to pray by the Spi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rit, was enough to render a man the object of scorne and reproach, from all sorts of men, from the Pulpit to the stage. What? you are <hi>full of the Spirit,</hi> you will pray by the spirit, you have the gift, come let us heare your <hi>non-sence;</hi> And yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps these men would think themselves wronged, not to be accounted Christians. Christians, yea have not some preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themselves to be leaders of the flock; yea, mounted a <hi>story</hi> or two above their <hi>brethren,</hi> and claiming a <hi>Rule</hi> and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over them, made it their businesse to <hi>scoffe</hi> at, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the gifts of the spirit of God. And if this were the <hi>frame</hi> of their Spirit, what might be expected from others of professed prophannesse? It is not imaginable to what height of blasphemy, the processe in this kind amounted. The Lord grant there be nothing of this cursed <hi>leaven</hi> still remaining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us. Some <hi>bleatings</hi> of ill importance are sometimes heard. Is this the <hi>fellowship</hi> of the Holy Ghost that <hi>Believers</hi> are called unto? Is this the due <hi>Entertainment</hi> of him whom our Saviour promised to send for the supply of his Bodily absence, so as we might be no loosers thereby? Is it not enough that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should be contented with such a stupid blindnesse, as being
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:60108:152"/>
called Christians, to looke no farther for this comfort and consolation, then morall considerations common to Heathens, would lead them, when one infinitely holy and blessed person of the Trinity, hath taken this office upon him to be our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, but they must oppose and <hi>despise</hi> him also; nothing more discovers how <hi>few</hi> there are in the world, that have interest in that blessed name whereby we are all called. But this is no place to pursue this discourse. The aime of this discourse is to evince the folly and madnesse of men in generall, who professe to own the Gospell of Chist, and yet contemne and despise his <hi>Spi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rit,</hi> in whomsoever he is manifested. Let us be zealous of the gifts of the Spirit, not envious at them.</p>
               <p>Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what hath bin discoursed we may also <hi>try the spirits</hi> that are <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>5</label> gone abroad in the world; &amp; which have been exercising them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at severall seasons, ever since the <hi>Ascention</hi> of Christ. The <hi>iniquity</hi> of the generation that is past, &amp; passing away, lay in open cursed opposition to the <hi>holy Ghost.</hi> God hath been above them wherein they behaved themselves presumptiously. Satan, whose designe, as he is God of this world, is to be uppermost, not to dwell wholly in any <hi>forme</hi> cast down by the providence of God, hath now tran formed himselfe into an <hi>Angell</hi> of light, and he will pretend the Spirit also, and only. But there are seducing Spirits. 1 Tim. 4. 1. And we have a command not to believe every <hi>Spirit,</hi> but <hi>try the Spirits</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 16. And the reason ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is, because many false Spirits <hi>are gone abroad in the world,</hi> that is, men pretending to the Revelation of new Doctrines by the Spirit, whose deceipts in the first Church <hi>Paul into mateth,</hi> 2 Thess. 2. 2. Calling on men not to be shaken in mind by <hi>Spirit.</hi> The truth is the <hi>Spirits</hi> of these days are so grosse, that a man of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry easy discerning, may find them out: &amp; yet their delusion so <hi>strong</hi> that not a few are deceived. This is one thing that lys evident to every eye; That according to his wounted <hi>course,</hi> Satan with his delusions is runne into an <hi>extreame</hi> to his former actings.</p>
               <p>Not long <hi>since,</hi> his great designe (as I manifested,) was to <hi>try up</hi> Ordinances without the <hi>Spirit</hi> casting all the reproach <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>6</label> that he could upon him: now to cry up a <hi>Spirit without</hi> and against <hi>Ordinances,</hi> casting all reproach, and contempt possible upon them. Then he would have a <hi>ministry</hi> without the Spirit:
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:60108:152"/>
now a <hi>Spirit</hi> without a <hi>ministry.</hi> Then the <hi>reading</hi> of the <hi>word</hi> might suffice without either <hi>preaching,</hi> or <hi>praying</hi> by the Spirit: now the <hi>Spirit</hi> is enough without <hi>reading</hi> or <hi>studying</hi> the word at all. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he allowed a litterall <hi>embracing</hi> of what Christ had don in the flesh, now he talkes of <hi>Christ in the Spirit</hi> only, and denys him to be come in the flesh, the proper <hi>character</hi> of the false Spirit, we are warned of 1 Joh. 1. 3. Now because it is most certaine that the Spirit which we are to heare and <hi>embrace,</hi> is the Spirit promised by Christ, which is so cleare, that <hi>Him</hi> the <hi>Montanists Paraclete,</hi> yea and <hi>Mahomet</hi> pretended himselfe to be, and those of our daies affirme also pretend the same. Let us briefly <hi>try them</hi> by some of the Effects mentioned, which Christ hath promised to give the Holy Ghost for.</p>
               <p>The first generall Effect, as was observed, was this; that he <hi>should bring to remembrance the things that Christ spake for our gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and Consolation.</hi> This was to be the worke of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>7</label> towards the Apostles, who were to be the <hi>pen-men</hi> of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: this is to be his work towards <hi>Believers</hi> to the end of the world. Now the things that Christ hath spoken and did, are written that we might <hi>believe, and believing have life through his name Ioh.</hi> 20. 30. They are written in the Scripture. This then is the worke of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which Christ hath promised, he shall bring to our <hi>remembrances</hi> and give us understanding of the words of Christ in the Scripture for our guidance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation. Is this now the worke of the Spirit, which is abroad in the world, and perverteth many? Nothing lesse. His busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is to <hi>decry</hi> the things that Christ hath spoken which are <hi>written</hi> in the Word; To pretend new <hi>Revelations</hi> of his own; To lead men from the <hi>written</hi> word, wherein the whole worke of God, and all the promises of Christ are recorded.</p>
               <p>Againe, the worke of the Spirit promised by Christ, is to glorify him. <hi>He shall Glorify me, for he shall take of mine and shew it unto you.</hi> John 16. 14. him who was to suffer at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> who <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>8</label> then spake to his Disciples; It was to make him <hi>Glorious, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,</hi> and of high esteem in the hearts of <hi>Believers,</hi> and that by shewing his things, his <hi>Love, Kindnesse, Grace,</hi> and purchase unto them. This is the worke of the Spirit. The worke of the Spirit, that is gone abroad, is to <hi>glorify it selfe;</hi> to decry, and
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:60108:153"/>
render <hi>contemptible</hi> Christ that suffered for us under the name of a Christ <hi>without us;</hi> which it slights and despiseth, and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly. Its own <hi>Glory,</hi> its own <hi>honour</hi> is all that it aymes at: wholly inverting the order of the divine <hi>dispensations.</hi> The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all being, and lying in the <hi>Fathers love,</hi> the Sonne came to glorify the Father. He still says, <hi>I seek not my own glory, but the glory of him that sent me.</hi> The <hi>Sonne</hi> having carryed on the worke of <hi>Redemption,</hi> was now to be <hi>glorifyed</hi> with the Father. So he prays that it might be. John 17. 1. <hi>The hower is come, glorify the Sonne, and that with the glrry which he had before the world,</hi> when his joynt councell was in the carrying on the Fathers Love. Wherefore the Holy Ghost, is sent, and his worke is to <hi>glorify</hi> the Sonne; but now (as I said) we have a Spirit <hi>come forth,</hi> whose whole businesse is to <hi>glorify</hi> himselfe; whereby we may easily know whence he is.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the <hi>Holy Ghost sheds abroad the love of God in our Hearts</hi> (as was declared) and thence fills them with joy; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>9</label> 
                  <hi>Peace,</hi> and hope; quieting and refreshing the <hi>hearts</hi> of them, in whom he dwells, giving them liberty and rest, confidence and the boldnesse of children. This Spirit whereof men now boast is a <hi>Spirit of bondage,</hi> whose utmost worke is to make men <hi>quake,</hi> and tremble, casting them into an unsonlike frame of Spirit driving them up and down with horror and bondage, and drinking up their <hi>very naturall spirits</hi> &amp; making their whole man wither away. There is scarce any one thing that more evidently manifesteth the <hi>Spirit</hi> whereby some are now acted, not to be the <hi>Comforter</hi> promised by Christ then this, That he is a <hi>Spirit of bondage and slavery,</hi> in them in whom he is, and a spirit of <hi>cruelty;</hi> and <hi>reproach</hi> toward others, in a direct opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the holy Ghost in Believers, and all the ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purposes, for which as a Spirit of <hi>Adoption</hi> and <hi>Consolation,</hi> he is bestowed on them.</p>
               <p>To give one instance more; the Holy Ghost bestowed on <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>10</label> Believers, is a Spirit of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Supplication,</hi> as was manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted. The Spirit wherewith we have to doe, pretends the carrying men above such <hi>low</hi> and contemptible meanes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God. In a word it were a very <hi>easy</hi> and <hi>facile</hi> taske to passe through <hi>all</hi> of the <hi>eminent effects</hi> of the Holy Ghost, in and towards Believers; and to manifest, that the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:60108:153"/>
                  <hi>pretending spirit</hi> of our daies comes in a direct opposition, and contradiction to every one of them. Thus hath Satan passed from one <hi>extreame</hi> to another: from a <hi>bitter</hi> wretched <hi>opposition</hi> to the Spirit of Christ, unto a cursed pretending to the Spirit, still to the same end and purpose.</p>
               <p>I might give sundry other instances of the contempt or abuse of the dispensation of the Spirit. Those mentioned are the extreames whereunto all other are, or may be reduced; and I will not farther divert from that which lys directly in my ayme.</p>

               <p>To raise up our hearts to this frame, and fit us for the duty <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>2</label> intended, let us consider these three things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. First, <hi>What it is he comforts us against.</hi>
                  </item>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. There are three things in the whole course of our <hi>pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,</hi> that the consolations of the Holy Ghost are usefull and necessary in</p>
               <p n="1">1. First. In our <hi>Afflictions.</hi> Affliction is part of the <hi>provision</hi> that God hath made in his house for his Children, Heb. 12. 5, 6.
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:60108:154"/>
The great variety of its causes, meanes, uses, and effects, is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally known. There is a measure of them appointed for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one. To be wholly without them is a <hi>temptation,</hi> and so in some measure an Affliction. That which I am to speake unto is, that in all our <hi>afflictions,</hi> we need the <hi>consolations</hi> of the Holy Ghost. It is the nature of man to <hi>relieve</hi> himselfe, when he is entangled, by all waies and meanes. According as mens natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>spirits</hi> are, so do they mannage themselves under <hi>pressures.</hi> The spirit of a man will <hi>beare</hi> his infirmity; at least it will <hi>struggle</hi> with it.</p>
               <p>There are two great <hi>evills,</hi> one of which does generally seise <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>4</label> on men under their <hi>Afflictions,</hi> and keep them from a due ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of them. The Apostle mentioneth them both, Heb. 12. 5. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>despise not the chastisement of the Lord, neither faint when thou art repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> One of these extreames doe men usually fall into; either they <hi>despise</hi> the Lords correction, or <hi>sink</hi> under it.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Men despise it.</hi> They account that which befalls them to be a <hi>light</hi> or <hi>common</hi> thing. They take no notice of <hi>God</hi> in it. They can shift with it <hi>well enough:</hi> they look on <hi>instruments,</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond causes, provide for their own <hi>defence</hi> and vindication, with little regard to God, or his hand in their affliction. And the ground of this is, because they take in <hi>succours</hi> in their trouble, that God will not <hi>mix</hi> his grace withall. They fix on other <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,</hi> then what he hath appointed, and utterly loose all the benefits and advantage of their affliction. And so shall every man doe that <hi>relieves</hi> himselfe from any thing, but the <hi>consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, Men <hi>Faint and sink under</hi> their trialls, and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, Which the Apostle farther reproves, vers. 12. The first despise the <hi>assistance</hi> of the Holy Ghost through <hi>pride</hi> of heart: the latter <hi>refuse</hi> it through <hi>dejectednesse</hi> of spirit, and sink under the weight of their troubles. And who almost is there, that offends not on one of these <hi>hands?</hi> Had we not learned to count light of the <hi>chastisements</hi> of the Lord, and to take little notice of his <hi>dealings</hi> with us; we should find the season of our Afflictions to comprize no small <hi>portion</hi> of our Pilgrimage.</p>
               <p>Now there is no due management of our soules under any <hi>affliction,</hi> so that God may have the glory of it; and our selves <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>5</label>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:60108:154"/>
any spirituall benefit or emprovement thereby; but by the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations</hi> of the H. Ghost. All that our Saviour <hi>promiseth</hi> his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, when he tells them of the great <hi>trialls</hi> and <hi>tribulations</hi> they were to undergoe, is, <hi>I will send you the spirit,</hi> the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, He shall give you <hi>peace</hi> in me, when in the world you shall have trouble. He shall guide, and direct, and keep you in all your <hi>trialls.</hi> And so the Apostle tells us it came to passe, 2 Cor. 1. 4, 5, 6. Yea and this under the <hi>greatest afflictions</hi> will carry the soule to the <hi>highest</hi> joy, peace, rest, and contentment. So the same Apostle, Rom. 5. 3. <hi>We glory in tribulations.</hi> It is a great expression. He had said before, that we <hi>glorted in the hope of the glory of God,</hi> vers. 2. Yea, but what if manifold afflictions, and tribulations befall us? why? even in them also we <hi>glory,</hi> saith he, <hi>We glory in our tribulations;</hi> But whence is it, that our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are so borne up, to a due management of afflictions, as to <hi>glory</hi> in them in the Lord? He tells us, vers. 5. It is from the <hi>shedding abroad of the Love of God in our hearts by the Holy Ghost.</hi> And thence are Believers said to receive <hi>the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost.</hi> 1 Thes. 1 6. And to take <hi>joyfully the spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their goods.</hi> This is that I aime at; There is no manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor improvement of any Affliction, but meerely and solely, by the <hi>Consolations</hi> of the Holy Ghost. Is it then of any esteeme or value unto you, that you loose not all your trialls, temptations, and afflictions, learne to value that whereby alone they are rendred usefull.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Sinne</hi> is the second <hi>burthen</hi> of our lives, and much the <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test;</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>6</label> Unto this, is this Consolation peculiarly suited: So Heb. 6. 17, 18. an Allusion is taken from the <hi>man stayer</hi> under the <hi>Low,</hi> who having killed a man at <hi>unawares,</hi> and brought the guilt of his blood upon him selfe, fled with <hi>speed</hi> for his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance to the Citty of <hi>refuge:</hi> our great and only <hi>refuge</hi> from the guilt of sinne, is the Lord Jesus Christ in our flying to him, doth the spirit administer <hi>consolation</hi> to us. A <hi>sense</hi> of sin fills the heart with troubles and disquietnesse; it is the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> which gives us <hi>peace</hi> in Christ. <hi>That</hi> gives an apprehension of <hi>wrath,</hi> the Holy Ghost sheds abroad the <hi>Love</hi> of God in our hearts. From thence doth <hi>Satan,</hi> and the <hi>Low</hi> accuse us, as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Gods hatred, the spirit beares <hi>witnesse</hi> with our spirits, that we are the <hi>Children</hi> of God. There is not any one engine
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:60108:155"/>
or instrument, that <hi>sin</hi> useth, or sets up against our peace, but one effect or other of the Holy Ghost towards us, is <hi>suited</hi> and <hi>fitted</hi> to the casting of it downe.</p>
               <p>In the whole course of our <hi>obediénce</hi> are his consolations ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary also; That we may goe through with it <hi>cheerfully,</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>7</label> patiently to the end. This will afterwards be more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discovered as to particulars, when I come to give directions for our <hi>communion</hi> with this blessed comforter. In a word, in all the <hi>concernments</hi> of this life, and in our whole expectation of another, we stand in need of the <hi>consolations</hi> of the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>Without them, we shall either <hi>despise</hi> afflictions, or <hi>faint</hi> under <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>8</label> them, and God be neglected, as to his intendments in them.</p>
               <p>Without them, <hi>sin</hi> will either <hi>harden</hi> us to a contempt of it, or <hi>cast</hi> us downe to a neglect of the remedies, gratiously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided against it.</p>
               <p>Without them, <hi>duties</hi> will either <hi>puffe</hi> us up with pride, or <hi>leave</hi> us without that sweetnesse which is in new obedience.</p>
               <p>Without them, <hi>prosperity</hi> will make us <hi>carnall, sensuall,</hi> and to take up our contentment in these things, and utterly weaken us for the trialls of adversity.</p>
               <p>Without them, the <hi>comforts</hi> of our <hi>Relations,</hi> will separate us from God, and the <hi>losse</hi> of them make our hearts as <hi>Nabals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Without them, the <hi>calamity</hi> of the Church will <hi>overwhelme</hi> us; and the <hi>prosperity</hi> of the Church will not <hi>concerne</hi> us.</p>
               <p>Without them, we shall have <hi>wisdome</hi> for no worke, <hi>Peace</hi> in no condition, <hi>strength</hi> for no duty, <hi>successe</hi> in no triall, <hi>joy</hi> in no state, no <hi>comfort</hi> in life, no <hi>light</hi> in death?</p>
               <p>Now our Afflictions, our sins, and our obedience, with the Attendencies of them respectively, are the great <hi>concernments</hi> of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>9</label> our lives; what we are, in reference unto God, is comprized in them, and the due <hi>management</hi> of them, with their contraries, which come under the same rule; Through all these, doth there run a line of consolation from the Holy Ghost, that gives us a joyfull issue throughout: How sad is the condition of of poor, soules destitute of these consolations? What poor <hi>shifts</hi> are they forced to betake themselves unto? what <hi>Giants</hi> have they to encounter in their own strength and wehther they are conquered, or seem to conquer, they have nothing but the misery of their trialls.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:60108:155"/>
2. The second thing considerable, to teach us to put a due <hi>valuation</hi> on the consolations of the Holy Ghost, is, the <hi>matter</hi> of them, or that wherewith he comforts us. Now this may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the <hi>two</hi> heads, that I have formerly treated of: the <hi>Love</hi> of the Father, and the <hi>Grace</hi> of the Son. All the consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Holy Ghost consist in his <hi>acquainting</hi> us with, and <hi>communicating</hi> unto us, the <hi>Love</hi> of the Father, and the <hi>Grace</hi> of the Sonne: nor is there any thing in the <hi>one</hi> or the <hi>other,</hi> but he makes it a matter of consolation to us; so that indeed we have our communion with the <hi>Father</hi> in his <hi>Love,</hi> and the <hi>Sonne</hi> in his <hi>Grace,</hi> by the <hi>operation</hi> of the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p n="1">1. First, He <hi>communicates</hi> to us, and acquaints us with the <hi>Love</hi> of the Father. Having informed his Disciples with that <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>11</label> ground and foundation of their consolation, which by the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter</hi> they should receive; our blessed Saviour, Joh. 16. 27. shuts up all in this, <hi>The Father himselfe loveth you:</hi> This is that which the Comforter is given to acquaint us withall; even that <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>Father,</hi> and that he <hi>loves</hi> us. In particular, that the <hi>Father</hi> the first Person in Trinity, <hi>considered</hi> so distinctly, loves us. On this account is he said so often to <hi>come forth</hi> from the Father, because he comes in pursuit of his <hi>Love,</hi> and to acquaint the <hi>Hearts</hi> of Believers therewith, that they may be <hi>comforted</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished. By perswading us of the <hi>eternall,</hi> and unchangeable <hi>Love</hi> of the Father, he fills us with Consolation. And indeed all the <hi>effects</hi> of the Holy Ghost before mentioned, have their tendency this way. Of this <hi>Love,</hi> and its transcendent excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy you heard at large before. Whatever is desireable in it, is thus <hi>communicated</hi> to us by the Holy Ghost. A sense of this is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not only to <hi>relieve</hi> us, but to make us in every <hi>condition</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with joy unspeakable, and glorious. It is not with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of <hi>Corne, and Wine, and Oyle;</hi> but with the <hi>shining</hi> of the countenance of God upon us, that he <hi>comforts</hi> our soules, Psal. 4. 6. The <hi>world hateth</hi> me, (may such a soule as hath the spirit say,) but my <hi>Father loves</hi> me. Men <hi>despise</hi> me, as an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> but my <hi>Father</hi> loves me, as a <hi>Child.</hi> I am <hi>poore</hi> in this world, but I have a <hi>rich</hi> inheritance in the love of my Father. I am <hi>straitned</hi> in all things but there is <hi>bread</hi> enough in my Fathers house. I <hi>mourne</hi> in secret, under the power of my <hi>lusts,</hi> and sin, where no eye sees me; yea, but the <hi>Father</hi> sees me, and is full of compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:60108:156"/>
With a sense of his kindnesse, which is <hi>better then life,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in tribulation, glory in affliction, triumph as a conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, Though I am <hi>killed all the day long,</hi> All my <hi>sorrowes</hi> have a <hi>bottome</hi> that may be fathomed; my <hi>trialls bounds,</hi> that may be compassed: but the <hi>breadth,</hi> and <hi>depth,</hi> and <hi>height</hi> of the love of the Father, who can expresse? I might render glorious this way of the spirits <hi>comforting</hi> us, with the Love of the Father, by comparing it with all other <hi>causes,</hi> and meanes of joy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation whatever. And so discover their <hi>emptinesse,</hi> its <hi>fullnesse,</hi> their <hi>nothingnesse,</hi> its being <hi>all;</hi> as also by revealing the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it before rehearsed.</p>
               <p>Againe, He doth it by <hi>communicating</hi> to us, and acquainting <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>12</label> us with the <hi>Grace</hi> of Christ. All the <hi>fruits</hi> of his purchase, all the <hi>desireablenesse</hi> of his Person, as we are interested in him. The grace of Christ (as I formerly discoursed of at large) is refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to two heads: The <hi>Grace</hi> of his Person; and of his <hi>Office,</hi> and Worke. By both these doth the Holy Ghost administer Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to us, Joh. 14. 15. He <hi>glorifies</hi> Christ, by revealing his <hi>Excellencies,</hi> and desireablenesse to believers, as the <hi>chiefest of ten thousand, altogether lovely.</hi> And then he shewes them of <hi>the things</hi> of Christ; his <hi>Love, grace,</hi> all the fruits of his Death, <hi>Suffering, Resurrection,</hi> and Intercession, and with these supports their hearts and soules. And here whatever is of refreshment in the <hi>pardon</hi> of sinne, deliverance from the <hi>curse,</hi> and wrath to come, in <hi>justification,</hi> and adoption, with the innumerable <hi>priviledges</hi> attending them in the <hi>hope</hi> of glory given unto us, comes in on this head of account.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Principle,</hi> and fountain of all his actings for our Consolation comes next under consideration to the same <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>13</label> end, and this leads us a little <hi>nearer</hi> to the Communion inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be directed in. Now this is his own great <hi>Love,</hi> and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite condescension. He willingly <hi>proceedeth,</hi> or <hi>comes forth</hi> from the Father to be our comforter. He knew what <hi>we were,</hi> and what we could <hi>doe,</hi> and what would be our <hi>dealings</hi> with him. He knew we would <hi>grieve</hi> him, <hi>provoke</hi> him, <hi>quench</hi> his motions, <hi>defile</hi> his dwelling place; and yet he would come to be our <hi>comforter.</hi> Want of a due <hi>consideration</hi> of the great <hi>Love</hi> of the Holy Ghost, weakens all the <hi>principles</hi> of our obedience. Did this dwell, and abide upon our <hi>hearts,</hi> what a deare <hi>valuation</hi>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:60108:156"/>
must we needs put upon all his <hi>operations</hi> and actings towards us? Nothing indeed is <hi>valuable,</hi> but what comes from <hi>love</hi> and goodwill. This is the way the Scripture takes to raise up our hearts, to a right and due estimation of our <hi>Redemption</hi> by Jesus Christ. It tells us that he did it <hi>freely;</hi> that of his own <hi>Will</hi> he hath laid downe his life, that he did it out of <hi>love. Herein is manifested the love of God, that he laid downe his life for us,</hi> he loved <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 6. Gal 2. 20. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

Hereunto it adds our <hi>state</hi> and <hi>condition,</hi> considered as he undertook for us, <hi>sinners, enemies, dead,</hi> alienated, <hi>then</hi> he <hi>loved</hi> us, and <hi>dyed</hi> for us, and <hi>washed</hi> us with his blood.

Now there are three generall wayes, of the soules deportment in this communion, expressed all negatively in the Scripture, but all including positive duties.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Now these are First. <hi>Not to grieve him.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Secondly, <hi>Not to quench his motions.</hi>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>There are three things considerable in the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. First His <hi>Person,</hi> as <hi>dwelling</hi> in us. <label type="milestone">

                  <item>3. Thirdly His <hi>working</hi> in Ordinances of the word, and the Sacraments; all for the same end and purpose.</item>
               </list>
               <p>To these <hi>three,</hi> are the <hi>three</hi> cautions before suited.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. First, not to <hi>grieve</hi> him, in respect of his <hi>Person</hi> dwelling in us.</item>
                  <item>2. Secondly, Not to <hi>quench</hi> him, in respect of the <hi>actings,</hi> and motions of his grace.</item>
                  <item>3. Thirdly, Not to <hi>resist</hi> him in respect of the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of Christ and his guifts, for their administration.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now because the whole <hi>generall duty</hi> of Believers in their communion with the Holy Ghost, is comprised in these three things; I shall handle them severally.</p>
               <p>The First <hi>Caution</hi> concernes his <hi>Person</hi> immediately, as dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in us. It is given Eph. 4. 30. <hi>Grieve not the holy Spirit of God.</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>4</label> There is a complaint, Isai. 63. 10. of them who <hi>vexed, or grieved the Spirit of God.</hi> And from thence doth this <hi>Caution</hi> seem to be taken. That it is the <hi>Person</hi> of the Holy Ghost which is here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, is evident.</p>
               <p>First, from the <hi>Phrase,</hi> or manner of expression, with a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble article <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>that holy spirit:</hi> And also,</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the <hi>work</hi> assigned to him in the following words, of <hi>Sealing to the day of Redemption.</hi> Which (as hath been manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,) is the work of the Holy Ghost. Now whereas this may be understood of the spirit in <hi>others,</hi> or in <hi>ourselves;</hi> it is evident that the Apostle intends it in the <hi>latter sense,</hi> by his addition of that <hi>signall,</hi> and eminent priviledge which we our selves enjoy by him, he <hi>seales</hi> us to the day of redemption.</p>
               <p>Let us see then the tendency of this expression, as comprizing the first <hi>Generall</hi> rule of our communion with the Holy Ghost. <hi>Grieve not the spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:60108:157"/>
The terme of <hi>grieving,</hi> or <hi>affecting with sorrow,</hi> may be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red either <hi>Actively,</hi> in respect of the Persons <hi>grieving;</hi> or <hi>Passively</hi> in respect of the Persons <hi>grieved.</hi> In the latter sense the expression is <hi>Metaphoricall;</hi> the Spirit cannot be <hi>grieved,</hi> or <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi> with sorrow, which inferrs alteration, disappointment, weakenesse, all incompatible with his infinite perfections: yet men may <hi>actively</hi> do that which is fit and able to grieve any one that stands <hi>affected</hi> towards them, as doth the Holy Ghost. If he be not grieved it is no thanks to us, but to his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable nature. So that there are two things denoted in this expression.</p>
               <p>First, That the Holy Ghost is affected towards us, as one that is loving, carefull, tender, concerned in our good, and <hi>welldoing,</hi> and therefore upon our <hi>miscarriages</hi> is said to be grieved. As a good friend of a kind, and loving nature is apt to be so on the miscarriage of him whom he doth affect. And this is that we are principally to regard in this caution as the ground and foundation of it; the <hi>Love, Kindnesse,</hi> and tendernesse of the Holy Ghost unto us. <hi>Grieve him not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That we may doe those things, that are <hi>proper</hi> to grieve him, though he be not <hi>passively</hi> grieved; our sin being no lesse therein, then if he were grived as we are. Now how this is done, how the Spirit is grieved, the Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth in the contexture of that discourse, verses 21, 22, 23, 24. He <hi>presseth</hi> to a progresse in <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and all the fruits of Regeneration vers. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. He dehorts from sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry particular evills, that were contrary thereto, and then gives the generall enforcement of the <hi>one</hi> and the other; and <hi>grieve not the Holy Spirit of God;</hi> that is by coming short of that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall <hi>Sanctification,</hi> which our planting into Christ doth require. The <hi>positive duty</hi> included in this caution, of not grieving the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> is this; That we <hi>pursue universall Holinesse with regard</hi> unto, and upon the account of the <hi>love, kindnesse,</hi> and <hi>tendernesse</hi> of the Holy Ghost. This is the foundation of our Communion, we have in generall. When the soul considers the love, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and tendernesse of the Holy Ghost unto him, when he considers all the fruits and acts of his love and goodwill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and on that account, and under that consideration,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:60108:158"/>
because he is so <hi>concerned</hi> in our ways, &amp; walkings, to abstaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>evills</hi> &amp; to <hi>walke in all duties</hi> of Holinesse, this is to have <hi>communion</hi> with him. This consideration that the Holy Ghost, who is our <hi>Comforter,</hi> is delighted with our <hi>obedience,</hi> grieved at our <hi>evills,</hi> and follies, being made a continuall motive to, and reason of our close walking with God in all holinesse, is, I say, the first gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall way of our <hi>Communion</hi> with him.</p>
               <p>Here let us fixe a little. We loose both the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>6</label> of our Obedience, for want of this consideration. We see on what account the Holy Ghost undertakes to be our <hi>Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> by what ways and meanes he performes that <hi>Office</hi> towards us: what an unworthy thing it is to <hi>grieve</hi> him, who comes to us on purpose to give us consolation? Let the soule in the whole course of its obedience exercise its selfe by faith to thoughts hereof, and lay due weight upon it. The Holy Ghost in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite love and kindnesse towards me, hath condescended to be my Comforter; He doth it willingly, freely, powerfully; what have I received from him? in the multitude of my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitys how hath he <hi>refreshed</hi> my soule? Can I live one day without his consolations? And shall I be regardlesse of him in that wherein he is concerned? shall I grieve him by negligence, sinne and folly? shall not his love constraine me to walke before him to all well pleasing? So have we in generall, <hi>fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship</hi> with him.</p>
               <p>The second is that of the 1 Thess. 5. 19. <hi>Quench not the Spirit.</hi> There are various thoughts about the sense of these words. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>7</label> The Spirit in others, that is, their spirituall gifts say some. But then it falls in with what follows vers. 20. <hi>despise not Prophesying.</hi> The <hi>Light</hi> that God hath set up in our hearts, say others. But where is that called absolutely <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. It is the Holy Ghost himselfe that is here intended. Not <hi>immediately,</hi> in respect of his <hi>Person,</hi> in which regard he is said to be grieved, which is a Personall affection: but in respect of <note place="margin">Isa. 4. 4.</note> his <hi>motions,</hi> actings, &amp; operations. The Holy Ghost was typified by the fier, that was allways kept alive on the <hi>Altar.</hi> He is also called a Spirit of <hi>burning.</hi> The reasons of that Allusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, not now to be insisted on. Now the oppositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is made to <hi>fier</hi> in its acting, is by <hi>querching.</hi> Hence the opposition made to the <hi>actings</hi> of the Holy Ghost are called <hi>Quenching of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:60108:158"/>
as some kind of wet wood will doe, when it is cast into the the fire. Thence are we said in pursuance of the same meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to stirre up with new <hi>fire</hi> the gifts that are in us. The Holy Ghost is striving with us, acting in us, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving variously for our growth in grace, and bringing forth fruit meet for the principle he hath indued us withall. Take heed (saith the Apostle) least by the power of your <hi>lusts</hi> and <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> you attend not to his workings, but hinder him in his good will towards you; that is what in you lyeth.</p>
               <p>This then is the second <hi>Generall Rule</hi> for our <hi>Communion</hi> with <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>8</label> the Holy Ghost. It respects his gratious <hi>operations</hi> in us, and by us. There are severall and <hi>various ways,</hi> whereby the Holy Ghost is sayd to <hi>act, ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rt,</hi> and <hi>put forth</hi> his power in us: partly by moving upon and stirring up the Grace we have received: partly by new supplys of Grace from Jesus Christ, falling in with ocasions for their <hi>exercise,</hi> raysing good motions imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, or occasionally within us, all tending to our <hi>furtherance</hi> in obedience, and walking with God. All these are we care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to <hi>observe</hi> and take notice of. Consider the <hi>Fountaine,</hi> whence they come &amp; the end which they lead us unto; Hence have we <hi>Communion</hi> with the Holy Ghost, when we can consider him by faith, as the immediate author of all supplys, assistances, and the whole reliefe we have by Grace, of all good <hi>actings, risings,</hi> motions in our hearts, of all strivings and contendings against sinne; When we consider I say all these his actings, and workings in their tendencys to our consolation, and on that account are carefull and watchfull to improve them all to the end aymed at, as coming from him, who is so loving and kind, and tender to us, we have Communion with him.</p>
               <p>This is that which is intended. Every gracious acting of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>9</label> the blessed Spirit in and towards our soules, is constantly by Faith to be considered as <hi>comming</hi> from him in a peculiar manner: His minde, his good will, is to be observed therein. Hence care and diligence for the improvement of every moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his will arise, thence reverence of his presence with us, with due spirituall regard to his Holinesse doth ensue, and our soules are wonted to entercourse with him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third caution concernes <hi>him,</hi> and his <hi>worke,</hi> in the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>10</label> dispensation of that great <hi>ordinance</hi> of the Word. <hi>Stephen</hi> tells
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:60108:159"/>
the <hi>Jewes</hi> Act. 7. 51. that <hi>They resisted the Holy Ghost,</hi> How did they doe it? why as their <hi>Fathers did it.</hi> As <hi>your Fathers did, so do ye.</hi> How did their Fathers resist the Holy Ghost? vers, 52. They <hi>persecuted the Prophets and slew them;</hi> their opposition to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in preaching the Gospell, or their shewing of the coming of the just one, was their <hi>resisting</hi> of the Holy Ghost. Now the Holy Ghost is said to be resisted in the contempt of the <hi>preaching</hi> of the word, because the gift of <hi>preaching</hi> of it is from him. The <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>manifestation of the Spirit is given to profit.</hi> Hence when our Saviour Promiseth the Spirit to his <hi>Disciples,</hi> to be present with them for the conviction of the world; he tells them he will give them a <hi>mouth</hi> and <hi>wisedome,</hi> which their adversaries shall not be able to <hi>gainsay,</hi> nor <hi>resist:</hi> Luk. 20. 16. concerning which in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of it in <hi>Stephen,</hi> it is said that they <hi>were not able to resist the Spirit by which he spake,</hi> Act. 6. 10. The <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> then setting up a <hi>ministry</hi> in the Church, separating men thereto, furnishing them with <hi>gifts</hi> and abilitys for the dispensation of the <hi>Word;</hi> the not <hi>obeying</hi> of that <hi>word,</hi> opposing of it, not <hi>falling</hi> down before it, is called resisting of the Holy Ghost. This in the examples of the <hi>wickednesse</hi> of others are we cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against. And this enwraps the third <hi>generall Rule</hi> of our Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Holy Ghost; in the <hi>despensation</hi> of the Word of the Gospell, the <hi>Authority,</hi> wisdome and goodnesse of the Holy Ghost, in furnishing men with gifts for that end, and purpose, and his presence with them, as to the vertue thereof, is to be <hi>eyed;</hi> and subjection given unto it on that account. On this reason I say, on this <hi>ground,</hi> is obedience to be yeilded to the word, in the <hi>ministeriall</hi> dispensation thereof; because the Holy Ghost and he alone doth furnish with gifts to that end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. When this consideration causeth us to fall <hi>low</hi> before the word, then have we <hi>Commuinon</hi> with the Holy Ghost in that Ordinance. But this is commonly Spoken unto.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Particular Directions for Communion with the Holy Ghost.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BEfore I name Particular Directions for our <hi>Communion</hi> with the Holy Ghost, I must premise some <hi>Cautions,</hi> as <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>1</label> farre as the <hi>directions</hi> to be given concern his worship.</p>
               <p>First, The <hi>Divine Nature</hi> is the Reason, and cause of all wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; so that it is impossible to <hi>worship any one</hi> person, and not worship the <hi>whole</hi> Trinity. It is (and that not without ground) denyed by the <hi>Schoolemen,</hi> that the <hi>formall Reason</hi> and object of divine worship, is in the persons <hi>precisely</hi> considered; that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>formally</hi> constitutive Reason of their personality, which is their <hi>Relation</hi> to each other: But this belongs to the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and Essence, and to their <hi>distinct</hi> persons as they are <hi>identified</hi> with the Essence it selfe. Hence is that way of praying to the <hi>Trinity,</hi> by the repetition of the same Petition, to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall persons (as in the <hi>Letany) groundlesse,</hi> if not impious. It supposeth that one person is <hi>worshipped,</hi> and not <hi>another,</hi> when each person is worshipped as <hi>God,</hi> and each person is so. As though we first should <hi>desire</hi> one thing of the Father, and be <hi>heard</hi> and granted by him, then aske the same thing of the <hi>Son,</hi> and so of the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> And so act as to the <hi>same</hi> thing three distinct <hi>acts</hi> of worship, and expect to be heard, and have the same thing granted <hi>three times</hi> distinctly, when all the workes of the Trinity <hi>ad extra,</hi> are indivisible.</p>
               <p>The proper, and peculiar <hi>object</hi> of divine worship, and invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, is the <hi>Essence</hi> of God in its infinite <hi>Excellency,</hi> dignity, <hi>Majesty,</hi> and its causality as the first soveraigne <hi>cause</hi> of all things: Now this is common to all the <hi>three Persons,</hi> and is <hi>proper</hi> to each of them; not <hi>formally,</hi> as a Person, but as <hi>God</hi> blessed for ever. All adoration respects that which is <hi>common</hi> to all: so that in each Act of <hi>Adoration</hi> and worship, all are <hi>adored,</hi> and worshipped. The Creatures worship their Creator; and <hi>a man</hi> him in whose <hi>image</hi> he was created, <hi>viz.</hi> him from whom <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendeth every good and perfect gift;</hi> all this describing God, as God. Hence,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:60108:160"/>
Secondly, when we begin our <hi>Prayers</hi> to God the Father, and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>2</label> end them in the name of <hi>Jesus Christ:</hi> yet the <hi>Sonne</hi> is no lesse invocated, and worshipped in the beginning then the <hi>Father,</hi> though he be peculiarly mentioned as <hi>mediator</hi> in the close; not as <hi>Sonne</hi> to himselfe, but as <hi>Mediator</hi> to the whole Trinity, or God in Trinity. But in the <hi>invocation</hi> of God the Father, we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate every Person, because we Invocate the <hi>Father</hi> as <hi>God,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Person being so.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. In that heavenly <hi>Directory</hi> which we have, Eph. 2. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>3</label> 18. this whole businesse is declared: our accesse in our <hi>worship</hi> is said to be <hi>to the Father;</hi> and this <hi>through</hi> Christ, or his <hi>mediati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on by</hi> the Spirit, or his assistance. Here is a <hi>distinction</hi> of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as to their operations; but not at all as to their being the <hi>object</hi> of our Worship. For the <hi>Sonne,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> are no lesse worshipped, in our <hi>accesse</hi> to God, then the Father him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Only the <hi>Grace</hi> of the Father, which we obtain by the mediation of the Sonne, and the assistance of the spirit, is that which we draw nigh to God for. So that when by the distinct dispensation of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and every Person, we are lead to worship; that is, to act Faith on, or invocate any Person, we doe herein worship the <hi>whole Trinity,</hi> and every Person, by what name soever, of Father, Sonne, or Holy Ghost, we invocate him. So that this is to be observed in this whole matter; That when any <hi>work</hi> of the Holy Ghost (or any other Person) which is appropriated to him (we never exclude the <hi>concurrence</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Persons) draws us to the <hi>worship</hi> of him; yet he is not <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped exclusively,</hi> but the whole Godhead is worshipped.</p>
               <p>Fourthly. These Cautions being premised, I say, that we <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>4</label> are distinctly to <hi>worship</hi> the Holy Ghost. As it is in the case of Faith, in respect of the <hi>Father</hi> and the Sonne, Joh. 14 1. <hi>Believe in God, believe also in me.</hi> This extends it selfe no lesse to the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost.</hi> Christ called the <hi>Disciples</hi> for the acting of <hi>Faith</hi> on him, he being upon the accomplishment of the great worke of his <hi>Mediation:</hi> and the Holy Ghost now <hi>carrying</hi> on the work of his delegation requireth the same. And to the same purpose are their distinct operations mentioned. My <hi>Father worketh hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, and I worke.</hi> Now as the formall Reason of the worship of the Sonne, is not his mediation, but his being God, his medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation being a powerfull motive thereto; so the <hi>formall Reason</hi>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:60108:160"/>
of our worshipping the Holy Ghost, is not his being our <hi>comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> but his being <hi>God,</hi> yet his being our comforter is a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>motive</hi> thereunto.</p>
               <p>This is the summe of the first Direction. The Grace, actings, <hi>Love,</hi> effects of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> as he is our Comforter, ought to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>5</label> stir us up, and provoke us to <hi>Love, worship, believe</hi> in, and <hi>invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> him: though all this being <hi>directed</hi> to him as God, is no lesse directed on that account, to the other <hi>Persons,</hi> then to him; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the fruits of his Love towards us, are we stirred up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
               <p>These things being presupposed; let the Saints learne to act <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>6</label> faith <hi>distinctly</hi> on the Holy Ghost, as the immediate efficient cause of all the good things mentioned. Faith I say to <hi>believe</hi> in him; and Faith in all things to <hi>believe</hi> him, and to yeeld obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him. Faith, not imagination. The distinction of the Persons in the Trinity, is not to be <hi>fancyed</hi> but believed. So then, the Scripture so fully, frequently, clearly, <hi>distinctly</hi> ascribing the things we have been speaking of, to the <hi>immediate efficiency</hi> of the Holy Ghost, Faith closeth with him, in the truth revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and <hi>peculiarly</hi> regards him, worships, him serves him, waits for him, prayeth to him, prayseth him; All these things, I say, the Saints doe in Faith; The person of the Holy Ghost, <hi>reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> its selfe in these <hi>operations</hi> and effects, is the <hi>peculiar</hi> object of our Worship. Therefore when he ought to be <hi>peculiarly</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and is not, he is peculiarly sinned against. Acts 5. 2 <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias</hi> is said to lye to the Holy Ghost: not to God, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken essentially, would denote the whole Trinity; but <hi>peculiarly</hi> to the Holy Ghost. Him he was to have honoured <hi>peculiarly,</hi> in that especiall gift of his, which he made profession of: not doing it, he sinned peculiarly against him: But this must be a little farther branched into particulars.</p>
               <p>Let us then say weight on every <hi>Effect</hi> of the Holy Ghost, in any of the <hi>Particulars</hi> before mentioned, on this account, that <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>7</label> they are <hi>acts</hi> of his <hi>Love,</hi> and power towards us. This faith will doe that takes notice of his <hi>kindnesie</hi> in all things. Frequently he performes, in sundry particulars, the office of a <hi>Comforter</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and we are not throughly comforted; we take <hi>no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice</hi> at all of what he doth. Then is he <hi>grieved.</hi> Of those who doe <hi>receive</hi> and own the <hi>Consolation</hi> he tenders, and administers;
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:60108:161"/>
how <hi>few</hi> are there that consider him as the <hi>comforter,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in him as they ought. Upon every work of <hi>consolation</hi> that the Believer receives, this ought his Faith to resolve upon. This is from the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> He is the <hi>comforter,</hi> the <hi>God of all Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> I know there is no <hi>joy, peace, hope,</hi> nor comfort but what he <hi>workes,</hi> gives and bestowes; and that he might give me this Consolation, he hath willingly <hi>condescended</hi> to this office of a Comforter, his <hi>Love</hi> was in it, and on that account doth he continue it. Also he is sent by the <hi>Father</hi> and Sonne for that end and purpose. By this meanes come I to be partaker of my <hi>joy;</hi> it is in the Holy Ghost; of <hi>consolation,</hi> he is the <hi>comforter.</hi> What price now shall I set upon his Love. How shall I value the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that I have received?</p>
               <p>This I say, is applicable to every <hi>particular</hi> effect of the Holy Ghost towards us; &amp; herein have we <hi>communion and fellowship</hi> with <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>8</label> him, as was in part <hi>discovered</hi> in our handling the particulars. Doth he <hi>shed abroad the Love of God in our hearts?</hi> doth he witnesse: unto our Adoption? the soule considers his presence, ponders his Love, his condescension, goodnesse, and kindnesse, is filled with reverence of him, and care not to grieve him, and labours to preserve his <hi>Temple,</hi> his <hi>Habitation</hi> pure and holy.</p>
               <p>Againe, our communion with him causeth in us <hi>Returning praise,</hi> and thanks, and honour, and glory, and blessing to him, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>9</label> on the account of the mercies and priviledges which we <hi>receive</hi> from him, which are many: Herein consists our next direction. So do we with the <hi>Sonne of God</hi> on the account of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>To him that loved us, and washed us with his own blood, to him be praise and glory,</hi> Rev. 1. 6, 4, 14. And are not the like <hi>praises</hi> and <hi>blessings</hi> due to him, by whom the work of Redemption is made <hi>effectuall</hi> to us? who with no lesse infinite <hi>love</hi> undertook our <hi>consolation,</hi> then the Sonne our <hi>Redemption?</hi> when we feele our hearts <hi>warmed</hi> with joy, <hi>supported</hi> in peace, <hi>established</hi> in our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, let us ascribe to him the praise that is due to him; blesse his name, and rejoyce in him.</p>
               <p>And this glorifying of the Holy Ghost in thanksgivings, on <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>10</label> a <hi>spirituall</hi> sense of his consolations, is no small part of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him. Considering his free ingagement in this work, his <hi>coming forth</hi> from the <hi>Father</hi> to this purpose, his <hi>mission</hi> by the <hi>Son,</hi> and condescension therein, his Love and kindnesse,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:60108:161"/>
the soule of a believer, is powred out in thankfull <hi>praises</hi> to him, and is sweetly affected with the duty. There is no duty that leaves a more heavenly savour in the soule then this doth.</p>
               <p>Also in our <hi>prayers to</hi> him, for the carrying on the work of our <hi>consolation,</hi> which he hath undertaken ly's our communion <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>11</label> with him. <hi>John</hi> praies for <hi>Grace</hi> and peace from the <hi>seven spirits</hi> that are before the Throne; or the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> whose operations are perfect and compleat. This part of his worship is expresly <hi>mentioned</hi> frequently in Scripture, and all others do necessarily attend it. Let the Saints consider, what need they stand in of these <hi>effects</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> before mentioned, with many such others, as might be insisted on. Weigh all the <hi>priviledges,</hi> which we are made partakers of. Remember that he <hi>distributes</hi> them as he will; that he hath the Soveraigne disposall of them, and they will be <hi>prepared</hi> for this duty.</p>
               <p>How and in what sense it is to be performed, hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared: what is the <hi>formall</hi> reason of this worship, and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>12</label> 
                  <hi>ultimate</hi> object of it, I have also manifested. In the <hi>duty</hi> it selfe is put forth no small part of the <hi>life,</hi> Efficacy, and vigor of Faith: and we come short of that enlargednesse of spirit in dealing with God, and are straightned from walking in the <hi>breadth</hi> of his waies, which we are called unto, if we learne not our selves to meet him with his worship in every way, he is pleased to communicate himselfe unto us. In these things he does so, in the <hi>person</hi> of the Holy Ghost; In that person do we meet him, his Love, Grace, and Authority, by our prayers and supplications.</p>
               <p>Again, Consider him as he <hi>condescends</hi> to this <hi>delegation</hi> of the Father, and the Sonne, to be our <hi>Comforter,</hi> and ask him daily <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>13</label> of the <hi>Father</hi> in the name of Jesus Christ. This is the daily work of Believers. They look upon, and by Faith consider the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> as promised to be sent: In this <hi>promise</hi> they know lies all their Grace, peace, mercy, joy, and hope. For by him so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, and him alone, are these things communicated to them. If therefore our <hi>life</hi> to God, or the <hi>joy</hi> of that life be considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in this we are to abound: to ask him of the Father, as <hi>Children</hi> doe of their <hi>Parents,</hi> daily bread. And as in this asking and receiving of the Holy Ghost, we have communion with the Father, in his <hi>Love,</hi> whence he is sent, and with the <hi>Son</hi>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:60108:162"/>
in his <hi>Grace,</hi> whereby he is obtained for us, so with himselfe, on the account of his <hi>voluntary condescension</hi> to this dispensation. Every <hi>request</hi> for the Holy Ghost, implyes our closing with all these; <hi>Oh the Riches of the Grace of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Humbling our selves for our miscarriages in reference to him, is another part of our communion with him. That we <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>14</label> have <hi>grieved</hi> him, as to his Person, <hi>quenched</hi> him, as to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his grace, or <hi>resisted</hi> him in his Ordinances, is to be mourned for, as hath been declared Let our Soules be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled before him on this account. This one considerable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient of <hi>Godly sorrow,</hi> and the thoughts of it, are as suitable to the affecting of our Hearts with humiliation, and indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against sin, as any other whatever. I might proceed in the like considerations; as also make application of them to the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular effects</hi> of the Holy Ghost enumerated; but my designe is only <hi>to point</hi> out the heads of things, and to leave them to the improvement of others.</p>
               <p>I shall shut up this whole discourse with some considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>15</label> of the sad <hi>estate</hi> and condition of men not interested in this <hi>promise</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> nor made partakers of his Consolation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They have no <hi>true Consolation</hi> or comfort be their Estate &amp; condition what it will. Are they under <hi>affliction</hi> or in trouble? They must beare their own <hi>burden;</hi> and how much to weak they are for it, if God be pleased to lay on his <hi>hand</hi> with more weight then ordinary, is easily known. Men may have stoutnesse of Spirit, and put on great <hi>Resolutions</hi> to wrestle with their <hi>troubles.</hi> But when this is meerly from the naturall spirit of a man,</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the most part it is but an outside. It is done with respect to others, that they may not appeare low spirited, or dejected. Their <hi>hearts</hi> are eaten up and devoured with <hi>troubles</hi> and <hi>anxiety</hi> of minde. Their thoughts are perplexed, and they are still striving, but never come to a conquest, Every new trouble every little alteration in their trialls, puts them to new <hi>vexation.</hi> It is an ungrounded resolution that beares them up and they are easily shaken.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly what is the best of their resolves and enduring? it is but a <hi>contending</hi> with God, who hath entangled them; the strugling of a <hi>flea</hi> under a mountaine. Yea though on out ward <hi>considerations</hi> and principles, they endeavour after <hi>patience</hi> and
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:60108:162"/>
tolerance; yet all is but a contending with God; a striving to be <hi>quiet</hi> under that which God hath sent on purpose to disturbe them: God doth not <hi>afflict men</hi> without the Spirit, to exercise their patience; but to disturbe their peace, and security All their arming themselves with patience and resolution, is but to keep the <hi>hold,</hi> that God will cast them out of; or else make them the <hi>nearer to ruine.</hi> This is the best of their consolation in the time of their trouble.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, if they doe promise to themselves any thing of the care of God towards them, and relieve themselves thereby, as they often doe on one account or another, (especially when they are driven from other holds) all their <hi>reliefe</hi> is but like the dreaming of an hungry man, who supposeth that he <hi>eateth</hi> and drinketh, and is refreshed; but when he awaketh, he is empty, and disappointed. So are they as to all their reliefe, that they promise to receive from God, and the support which they seem to have from him. When they are awaked at the latter day and see all things clearly, they will find that God was their <hi>enemy,</hi> laughing at their <hi>calamity,</hi> and mocking when their feare was on them.</p>
               <p>So is it with them in trouble. Is it any better with them in <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>16</label> their <hi>prosperity?</hi> This indeed is often great and is marvellously described in Scripture, as to their lives and oftentimes quiet peaceable ends. But have they any true <hi>consolation</hi> all their days? They <hi>eate, drink, sleep,</hi> and make merry, and perhaps heap up to themselves: but how little doe these things make them to differ from the beasts that perish? <hi>Solomons</hi> advantage to have the use, and know the utmost of these things much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any of the sons of men of our generation, is commonly taken notice of. The account also that he gives of them is known: They are all vanity, and vexation of Spirit. This is their consolation; a <hi>crackling of thornes</hi> under the pot, a sudden flash, and blaze, that begins but to <hi>perish.</hi> So that both <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity</hi> and <hi>prosperity</hi> slayeth them, and whether they are <hi>laughing</hi> or <hi>crying,</hi> they are still dying.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They have no peace; No peace with God, nor in their own soules. I know that many of them upon false bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>17</label> grounds, and expectations, do make a shift to keep things in some <hi>quietnesse.</hi> Neither is it my businesse at present
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:60108:163"/>
to discover the <hi>falsenesses</hi> and unsoundnesse of it. But this is their <hi>State:</hi> True, and <hi>Solid</hi> peace being an effect of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> in the hearts of Believers (as hath been declared) they who are not made partakers of him, have no such peace. They may cry <hi>Peace, Peace</hi> indeed, when sudden destruction is at hand. The <hi>Principles</hi> of their peace, (as may be easily evidenced) are <hi>darknesse,</hi> or <hi>ignorance,</hi> treachery of Conscience, selfe righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and vaine hope. To these heads may all the principles of their peace be reduced, and what will these availe them in the day when the Lord shall deale with them.</p>
               <p>I might say the same concerning their <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>hope:</hi> they are false and perishing. Let them then consider this, who have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>18</label> themselves with a perswasion of their interest in the good things of the Gospell, and yet have despised the spirit of Christ. I know there are many that may pretend to him, and yet are strangers from his Grace. But if they <hi>perish</hi> who in profession use him kindly, and honour him, if he dwell not in them with power, where shall they appeare who <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> and <hi>affront</hi> him? The Scripture tells us that unlesse the Spirit of Christ be in us, we are dead, we are reprobates, we are none of Christs without him, you can have none of these <hi>glorious effects</hi> of his towards Believers before mentioned; and you are so farre from enquiring whether he be in you or no, as that you are ready to deride them in whom he is. Are there none who professe the Gospell, who have never once <hi>seriously</hi> enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whether they are made partakers of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> or no? you that almost account it a ridiculous thing to be put upon any such <hi>Question;</hi> who looke on all men as vaine pretenders that talke of the Spirit; the Lord awake such men to a sight of their condition, before it be too late. If the <hi>Spirit dwell not in you,</hi> if he be not your Comforter, neither is God your <hi>Father,</hi> nor the <hi>Sonne</hi> your <hi>Advocate,</hi> nor have you any portion in the Gospell. O that God would awake some poor soule to the consideration of this thing; before the neglect and contempt of the Holy Ghost come to that dispising of him, from which there is no recovery? That the Lord would spread before them all the folly of their hearts, that they may be <hi>ashamed,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and do no more Presumptiously.</p>
