         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This was the caſe of our <hi>Mother</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>England</hi> in former times, as was long ſince ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by a <hi>Reverend</hi> Author, when ſhe was
(like <hi>Chriſt</hi> crucified between two Theives)
oppoſed by the ſuperſtitious <hi>Romaniſts</hi> on the
one hand, &amp; by the fiery <hi>Novelliſts</hi> on the other,
the firſt accuſing her of departing too far from
them, the other of coming too neer to them;
which contrary accuſations of men running in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
extreams, were a ſtrong evidence that ſhee
walked in the mean, which is the beſt and ſafeſt;
for, <hi>Medium tenuere beati.</hi> This which was the
condition of the <hi>Mother,</hi> is now become the
lot of ſome of her <hi>Sons</hi> in the late Edition of
the <hi>Biblia Polyglotta:</hi> for whereas the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher
of the ſaid <hi>Bible</hi> hath laboured to aſſert the
<hi>purity, integrity,</hi> and <hi>ſupream authority</hi> of the
<hi>Originall Texts,</hi> againſt thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> on the
one ſide, rejecting ſome <hi>Jewiſh</hi> opinions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily
ſwallowed by ſome amongſt our ſelves
on the other, he hath incurred the diſpleaſure of
both; the one complaining that too much is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
to the <hi>Originall Texts,</hi> the other, too
little: which is a good argument that he hath
kept cloſe to the Truth, from which thoſe that

negligence of the <hi>Greek Church</hi> is now loſt,
was carped and cavil'd at amongſt others by <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi>
as if he had corrupted the pure <hi>Tranſlation</hi>
of the LXX. by the additions which he made out
of <hi>Theodotion:</hi> When as <hi>Origen</hi> to preſerve the

by an <hi>Aſterisk,</hi> which being left out, what
remained was the meer and true <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of
the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> as <hi>Hierome</hi> himſelfe ſometimes
acknowledged, <hi>Epiſt. 11. ad Auguſtin.</hi> The

               <p>III. To come nearer to our owne times,
that <hi>Magnificent</hi> worke of the <hi>King of Spaines
Bible</hi> (by ſome ſtyled <hi>Orbis miraculum)</hi> was
approved by the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelfe to whom it was
preſented, as by his <hi>Breves</hi> prefixed appeares,
yet all could not protect the Publiſher thereof,
<hi>Arias Montanus</hi> (a learned and moderate <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſt)</hi>
though he did nothing without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Univerſity of <hi>Lovaine,</hi> and of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
particular learned men, from the <hi>jealouſies</hi>
and <hi>calumnies</hi> of malignant ſpirits, of his owne
Brethren, againſt whom he was faine to write
<hi>Apologies,</hi> and hardly eſcaped the <hi>Inquiſition.
Eraſmus</hi> his extraordinary paines, in publiſhing
the <hi>Greek Teſtament</hi> by comparing <hi>ancient copies</hi>
and <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> was ſufficiently railed at by
ſome <hi>Friers</hi> and ignorant <hi>Zelots,</hi> as if he took
upon him <hi>to correct the Word of God,</hi> as appears
in his Preface to his <hi>Annotations</hi> of 1535 (whoſe
very words are uſed, as we ſhall ſee hereafter,

though it be not without its defects, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous

its detractors, who envying that others ſhould
have the glory of that which themſelves were
unable to performe, have defamed it what they
could, witneſſe thoſe bitter and virulent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of <hi>Simeon de Muis, Regius</hi> Profeſſor
of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> in his <hi>Epiſtles</hi> publiſht
againſt it. And, to come yet nearer home: The
laſt <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation</hi> made by diverſe learned
men at the command of King <hi>James,</hi> though it
may juſtly contend with any now extant in any
other Language in <hi>Europe,</hi> was yet carped and
cavild at by diverſe among our ſelves, eſpecially
by one, who being paſſed by &amp; not imployed in
the Work, as one (though skild in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi>
yet) of little or no <hi>judgement</hi> in that or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kinde of Learning, was ſo highly offended,
that he would needs undertake to ſhew how

a man envyed of his Neighbour, <hi>as the</hi> Wiſe man

Candidly for the ſake and purſuit of truth, with a

about which all this ſtir is made, are chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115995:10"/>
to two, (though many be pretended)
1. That the</hi> Hebrew <hi>points, (that is, the</hi> modern

which are acknowledged to be coeve with

was never arbitrary, but the ſame before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the punctation) were deviſed and fixed by the</hi>
Maſorites <hi>about five hundred years after</hi> Chriſt.
<hi>2. That there are</hi> various readings <hi>in the Old
and New</hi> Teſtament, <hi>both in the</hi> Hebrew <hi>and</hi>
Greek <hi>(by the caſuall miſtake of tranſcribers,
yet in matters of no moment) which by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring

in ſome caſes out of ancient</hi> tranſlations, <hi>and
when they are diſcovered, the true reading may
be reſtored. Hence is inferred,</hi> the uncertainty
of all Divine truth, that the Scriptures are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
<hi>&amp;c. And hence are thoſe</hi> fears <hi>and</hi> jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies,
<hi>Epiſt. pag. 19. which how juſtly dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible

In the mean time, our Author practiſes what</hi>
Quintilian <hi>ſaid of ſome</hi> Romane <hi>Orators, who
did</hi> cauſarum vacua convitis implere, <hi>and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of</hi> Arguments, <hi>loads his adverſary with
reproaches, like that Souldier in</hi> Darius <hi>his
Army (mentioned by</hi> Plutarch) <hi>who, inſtead
of fighting with his hands, imployed his tongue
in railing upon</hi> Alexander, <hi>whereupon the</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall

                  <hi>VIII. When I firſt read this Pamphlet I
ſtood amazed at the ſtrange boldneſſe of the
Author, charging the</hi> Prolegomena <hi>with ſuch te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
and aſſertions, which they are ſo far from
maintaining, that they do aſſert and prove the
plain contrary, and that not</hi> obiter, <hi>or by the by,
but</hi> ex profeſſo, <hi>in full tracts. As for inſtance the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115995:12"/>
main Charge,</hi> p. 206. That there are corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yea groſſe corruptions befallen the Original
Texts, which men by their critical conjectures
may diſcover and correct, <hi>is ſo far from truth,
That the whole</hi> Prolegom. 7. <hi>is ſpent in proving
that the</hi> Original Texts <hi>are</hi> not corrupted either
by Jews, Chriſtians or others, that they are of
Supream authority in all matters, and the rule to
try all tranſlations by, That the copies we now
have are the true tranſcripts of the firſt <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
written by the ſacred Pen-men. That the ſpeciall
providence of God hath watched over theſe books,
to preſerve them pure and uncorrupt againſt all
attempts of Sectaries, Hereticks and others, and
will ſtill preſerve them to the end of the world, for
that end for which they were at firſt written. That
the errors or miſtakes which may befall by negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
or inadvertency of Tranſcribers or Printers,
are in matters of no concernment (from whence
various readings have riſen) and may by colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of other copies and other means there menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
be rectified and amended. <hi>The arguments
alſo brought by ſome Romaniſts againſt the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
certainty and authority of the</hi> Original
Texts <hi>are clearly anſwered, wherein I doubt
not but the Reader may find more ſatisfaction,
than in all theſe confuſed</hi> Conſiderations. <hi>And for
gathering</hi> various readings <hi>by meer</hi> conjectures,
<hi>the author of the</hi> Prolegom. <hi>is ſo far from appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that way, that he expreſſely rejects it, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115995:12"/>
gives reaſons againſt it.</hi> Prol. 6. ſect. ult. <hi>which
the author of the</hi> Conſiderations, p. 209. 305,
307. <hi>doth alſo acknowledge with thankfulneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IX. The like may be ſeen in moſt of his other
charges, wherein he fights with his own ſhadow,
and like a wanton whelp runs round after his
own ſtern, diſſembling his adverſaries opinion,
and inſtead thereof ſubſtituting any lame confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctary
which came ſuddenly into his diſtempered
fancy; For whatſoever might ſeem odious to
vulgar apprehenſions he aſcribes to the <hi>Prolego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi>
that ſo he might have colour to ſay what
he liſts. Other things are by him wilfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
and miſconſtrued, the controverſie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
truly ſtated, not one argument faithfully
recited, much leſs anſwered, nor the tenth part
of what is ſaid in the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> on the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in queſtion taken notice of, much leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed;
ſo that I was a long time in doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to take notice of theſe <hi>Conſiderations</hi> at all
by way of anſwer, there being nothing in them
which is not in the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> and <hi>Appendix</hi>
already fully anſwered, as thoſe that ſhall pleaſe
to compare both together may eaſily ſee, and
this was the opinion of ſome men of great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and judgement, that I ſhould not trouble
my ſelf with any anſwer. Beſides I have to deal
with one ſo poſſeſſed with <hi>prejudice</hi> and <hi>paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and thereby ſo <hi>pertinacious</hi> in his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that I ſhall but <hi>Aethiopem lavare;</hi> he
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115995:13"/>
may be <hi>convinced,</hi> but not <hi>converted,</hi> and will
hold his <hi>Concluſion</hi> in deſpight of the <hi>Premiſes.</hi>
Neither is his authority of ſuch weight with
judicious and learned men, as that they will
eſteem the <hi>Biblia Polyglotta,</hi> either the better
for his praiſes, or the worſe for his cenſure, ſo
that as his praiſes ſhould not tickle, ſo neither
his diſpraiſes trouble, <hi>Declamationes ambitioſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>
are onely <hi>otioſorum cibi</hi> (as <hi>Scal. exerc. 307)</hi>
nor is it my lot alone to be thus handled by
him, he layes about him on all ſides, and like
<hi>Iſmael,</hi> his hand is againſt every one, ſo that we
may ſay with the <hi>Epigrammatiſt, Omnibus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videas
Livide, nemo tibi,</hi> yea the volume it ſelf
begins already to ſerve for waſt paper in <hi>Grocers

the hands of diverſe, who never ſaw, and
it may be cannot read or underſtand the <hi>Biblia
Polyglotta,</hi> or the <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> and may ſimply
give credit to what he averres (for though he
ſay the opinions may be candidly diſputed
among learned men without danger, yet he hath
thought fit to ſubmit and expoſe them to the
judgement of the unlearned, who cannot judge
but may wreſt what they underſtand, not to
their own hurt, wherein either his prudence

bringing a <hi>Latine</hi> tract upon an <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſtage)

               <argument>
                  <p>I The occaſion and motives of publiſhing the Conſiderations.
II. The adverſary begins with an untruth. III. His ſiniſter
ends, writing in Engliſh againſt a Latine Treatiſe, and yet in
the ſame book writing in Latine againſt the Quakers.
IV. His love of the truth, candid and ſincere dealing.
V. His dangerous aſſertions againſt the miracles wrought
for confirmation of the Doctrine of the Bible, atteſted by the
Catholick Tradition of the Church of Chriſt. His affirming
that the Alcoran may vie miracles and traditions with the
Scripture, rejecting all arguments for the authority of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
ſave its own light. VI, VII. No private or
new opinions in the Prolegomena or Appendix. VIII. The
juſt grounds which the publiſher had to ſpeak of the things
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115995:14"/>
excepted againſt. IX. The groundleſse fears and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
of the adverſary X. His profeſsion of no great skill
in this learning. XI. That he knows not the Authors of
this Edition. XII His commending the Work, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of it. XIII. His conſequences charged upon the
Work, and not upon the Workmen, as he pretends. XIV. The
true cauſe of the quarrel is againſt the Workmen. XV. The
approbation of the Work by forreign Divines, Buxtorſs
teſtimony of it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>I. BEfore we deſcend to particulars, it will be
needfull to take notice Firſt of the</hi> occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>and</hi> motives <hi>of publiſhing theſe</hi> Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>and of their ſcope and end, concerning
which the author tells us.</hi> Cap. 1. ſect. 1, 2, 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
That he had written a Treatiſe of the Divine ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
of the Scriptures, their authority, and ſelf
evidencing light, and of the providence of God in
their preſervation, which being ready for the
Preſſe, the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> and <hi>Appendix</hi> of the
Bible came to his hands, wherein the great bulk
of various readings, and ſome opinions maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> did in his apprehenſion
much weaken the arguments by him inſiſted upon
in that Treatiſe, and therefore a neceſſity was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
upon him, either to deſiſt from publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, or elſe of giving an accompt of thoſe things in
the <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> and <hi>Appendix,</hi> which tended to
the diſadvantage of that great truth which he had
pleaded for. <hi>After he tells us of</hi> his fears and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies
of dangerous conſequences, &amp;c. <hi>and gives
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115995:15"/>
ſome reaſons to free himſelf from</hi> any ſuſpition
of malice or envy againſt the <hi>Biblia Polyglotta,</hi> or
any that had a hand in publiſhing of it, and calls
the ſearcher of all hearts to witneſſe, how clear he
was from any ſiniſter ends, &amp;c. <hi>and profeſſes
how</hi> candidly he will proceed for the ſake, and in
the purſuit of truth, with a mind free from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
and diſquieting affections, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>II. Concerning all which, I ſhall obſerve,
firſt, that it is ominous to <hi>ſtumble at the thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold,</hi>
as our Author here doth, what fair
dealing may we expect in his enſuing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
when he begins with a <hi>palpable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth?</hi>
he ſaith the <hi>Prolegomena and Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix</hi>
came to his hands after he had finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Treatiſe of the Scripture, and was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to give it to the Stationer, which was the
occaſion of theſe additional <hi>Conſiderations,</hi>
when as yet it appears that he had read the
<hi>Prolegomena and Appendix,</hi> before he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the firſt Chapter of his Treatiſe; for in that
Chapter he writes, <hi>p.</hi> 16. that <hi>Capellus his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
opinion about the uncertainty of Scripture,
is ſince approved and taken up by others,</hi> quoting
in the margent <hi>Prolegomena ad Biblia Polyglot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
and <hi>p.</hi> 20. he ſaith that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>is reckoned
amongſt the various Readings, gathered out of</hi>
Grotius, <hi>in the Appendix of the Biblia Polyglot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
by which it is evident that he had ſeen and
read the <hi>Prolegomena and Appendix</hi> before he
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115995:15"/>
wrote that Treatiſe, and therefore that the
publiſhing of the <hi>Prolegomena and Appendix</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Treatiſe was finiſhed, could not be the
cauſe of writing theſe <hi>Conſiderations</hi> in vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of that Treatiſe; here it ſeems his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
failed him, to ſay no worſe, and hereby
it plainly appears, that ſome other motives ſet
him on work, and not the vindication of his
Treatiſe; and though he proteſts the contrary,
yet <hi>proteſtatio contraria facto</hi> is not to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
nor regarded; for it is known that ſuch
<hi>Proteſtations</hi> with men who make no ſcruple of
affirming untruths, ariſes often from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſſe
of the guilt of that againſt which
they proteſt. <hi>Quid verba audiam, cum facta
videam?</hi> What are his <hi>Conſiderations,</hi> but a
cleere confutation of his proteſtation?</p>
               <p>III. If he had no ſiniſter ends, Why are they
written in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the Opinions which he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
being written in that Language wherein
Learned men debate ſuch things, as are not fit
for popular judgements? There could be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end in this, then to expoſe the <hi>Bib. Polyglot.</hi>
and <hi>Publiſhers</hi> of it to popular hatred. If his
<hi>fears</hi> and <hi>jealouſies</hi> were ſo great, that theſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
ſhould gain credit, and be received, why
did he not write againſt them in the ſame Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
which is generally known in <hi>Europe,</hi>
whereby an <hi>Antidote</hi> might have been ready
whereſoever they came; whereas to write in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115995:16"/>
                  <hi>Engliſh,</hi> cannot hinder the ſpreading of them
abroad, nor was there any great cauſe to fear
that his <hi>Engliſh</hi> readers could be infected by
them, when they underſtood them not, till he
informed them. This was not the true motive,
or elſe he took not the right courſe to prevent
the miſchief he ſeemed to fear. But to confute
a <hi>Latine</hi> Treatiſe in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and in the ſame
Book to adde a <hi>Latine</hi> Diſcourſe againſt the
<hi>Quakers,</hi> who abhor all Learning, and account
that Language, the <hi>Language of the Beaſt,</hi> will,
notwithſtanding his weak <hi>Apologie,</hi> be judged
a <hi>Soloeciſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. Beſides, if the truth, and love of the
truth, ſet him on work, why doth he faſten
upon his adverſary, things manifeſtly untrue,
charging him with opinions in one place, which
in another he clears him from. His perverting
his adverſaries tenets, propounding his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Anſwers by halfs, cutting them ſhort,
as <hi>Procruſtes</hi> (in <hi>Plut)</hi> did his priſoners, that
they might be fit for his bed, are proofs of his
<hi>candid and ſincere dealing,</hi> but chiefly his urging
the <hi>Conſequences</hi> of <hi>Papiſts, Atheiſts, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripturiſts,</hi>
&amp;c. whoſe <hi>Advocate</hi> he makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
rather then his Adverſary ſhall eſcape; If
he had not been led by ſome ſiniſter reſpects,
knowing that Pious and Learned men, yea, the
learnedſt <hi>Proteſtant Divines,</hi> and the beſt skilled
in the <hi>Eaſtern Languages,</hi> that are this day, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115995:16"/>
greateſt aſſertors of the <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> of
the <hi>originall Texts,</hi> againſt the <hi>Romiſh</hi> tenets,
have maintained the ſame, with the Author of
the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> about the <hi>Hebrew punctation,</hi>
and the <hi>various readings,</hi> and that himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
the main thing from which perverſe
and wicked men draw their concluſions, <hi>(viz. the
variety of readings in the Hebrew and Greek
Copies)</hi> he would have laboured to free thoſe
Worthies from ſuch <hi>imputations,</hi> and have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that no ſuch <hi>conſectaries</hi> could be logically
and rationally deduced from ſuch <hi>Premiſſes,</hi> as
indeed they cannot, whereas we ſee in him the
clean contrary; for he takes part with <hi>Papiſts,
Atheiſts, Antiſcripturiſts,</hi> &amp;c. and pleads their
cauſe, and labours to prove, even from ſuch <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes</hi>
as himſelf cannot deny, that thoſe wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>conſequences</hi> do neceſſarily follow; which
ſhews plainly, how he was blinded with <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice</hi>
and <hi>Paſſion,</hi> and how far he was from
that <hi>candor</hi> and <hi>freedom from diſquieting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi>
and from the <hi>love of truth,</hi> which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to.</p>
               <p>V. And though it had been the hard hap of
the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> &amp; <hi>Appendix</hi> to come out when
his <hi>Treatiſe</hi> was ready to be printed, which hath
procured all this trouble to himſelf and the
Readers; yet, was there ſuch a neceſſity of the
publiſhing his Treatiſe? Divers perſons of great
Learning and Judgement, think his pains might
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115995:17"/>
very well have been ſpared, and that inſtead of
proving the Divine Authority of the Scripture,
he hath much weakned it, and what in him lies,
ſhaken the very foundation of <hi>Religion;</hi> while
he rejects that main Argument to prove the
Scriptures to be from God, <hi>pag. 103, 104. viz.</hi>
the <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to confirm their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
brought down to us by the <hi>undoubted
teſtimony</hi> and <hi>univerſall tradition</hi> of the <hi>Church
of Chriſt,</hi> the moſt infallible and greateſt of all
humane <hi>teſtimonies,</hi> and next to that which is
immediatly <hi>Divine,</hi> and ſticks not to affirm,
that the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> may, <hi>vie miracles and tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
with the Scipture,</hi> p. 105. <hi>and that there is
no more reaſon to believe thoſe who have received
that tradition, and plead they have it, before and
againſt them who profeſſe they have no ſuch report
delivered them from their forefathers,</hi> p. 108.
<hi>nor have we more inducement to give credit to
their aſſertions, then to a like number of men
holding out a Tradition utterly to the contrary,</hi>
that is, why we ſhould believe the teſtimony of
the whole <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> in this point, before
the teſtimony of <hi>Jews, Pagans,</hi> and <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes,</hi>
to the contrary, p. 110. And whileſt he
grounds all upon the inward <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi>
it ſelf, which though it ſerve to confirm the
faith of believers, yet in the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> how we
come to know the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be from God,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115995:17"/>
we know, is by great and Learned <hi>Proteſtant
Divines,</hi> not allowed as a convincing argument
in this caſe; I ſubmit it to the judgement of all
men of common reaſon and judgment, whether
here be not a <hi>fair pretenſe</hi> for <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticall
Antiſcripturiſts</hi> to reject the <hi>Scripture,</hi>
when they find the argument from the <hi>miracles</hi>
and <hi>univerſall tradition</hi> rejected by ſome, and
that of the <hi>inward light</hi> of the <hi>Scripture</hi> (which
is here ſaid to be <hi>all the Divine evidence that
God is willing to grant us, or can be granted us, or
is any way needfull for us,</hi> p. 34. and <hi>that there
is no need of any further witneſſe or teſtimony)</hi>
p. 56. not admitted as ſufficient by others; and
whether they may not with more colour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
their <hi>concluſions</hi> againſt the <hi>Scriptures</hi> from
<hi>theſe aſſertions</hi> of his, then from any thing in the
<hi>Prolegomena</hi> or <hi>Appendix?</hi> For, where they find
him affirming, <hi>that there is no way to know the
Scriptures to be from God, but its own light,</hi> and
finde this denied by <hi>Learned Divines</hi> of all ſides,
they have ſome colour to conclude, that there
is no way at all to prove their <hi>Divine Originall,</hi>
and ſo to reject them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VI. Again, he writes, p. 159. and 160. That</hi>
in all theſe things (it is known to all men) there
is no new Opinion coyned or maintained by the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facer</hi>
to theſe Bibles, but that all have been main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by ſundry Learned men, <hi>and that,</hi> if they
had been kept in mens private writings, he ſhould
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115995:18"/>
not have thought himſelf, or his diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in them; <hi>but becauſe</hi> they are laid as the
foundation of the uſefulneſſe of the <hi>Bibl. Polygl.</hi>
and becauſe, of the authority which they may gain
thereby; <hi>and becauſe (as p. 152.)</hi> theſe private
Opinions, <hi>(as he calls them)</hi> are impoſed with too
much advantage on the mindes of men, by their
conſtant neighbourhood unto Canonicall truth,
therefore he muſt needs appear againſt them. <hi>Here
he ſpeaks plainly, what was the true cauſe of
theſe</hi> Conſiderations. <hi>The</hi> Biblia Polyglotta <hi>are
the Butt againſt which his Arrows are aimed, and
theſe Opinions about the</hi> Hebrew punctation, <hi>and</hi>
various Readings, <hi>had not been conſidered nor
meddled with, but for that Work to which they
were adjoyned, which, becauſe it was always</hi>
maligned, <hi>by himſelf and ſome others of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
therefore he took occaſion to quarrell with
theſe matters, that ſo he might bring the more
obloquie upon the whole, and make it the more
ſuſpected among the</hi> Vulgar.</p>
               <p>VII. But whereas he makes them <hi>private
Opinions,</hi> which now being joyned with a <hi>publike
Work,</hi> may pretend to <hi>publike Authority,</hi> he is
much deceived; or elſe ſeeks to deceive his <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous</hi>
Reader: for how can they be <hi>private,</hi> or
<hi>new Opinions</hi> which have been <hi>publikely</hi> aſſerted
in <hi>Print,</hi> before either of us were born, and have
been, and are ſtill maintained by the <hi>chiefeſt and
Learnedſt Divines in</hi> Europe, and the beſt skilled
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115995:18"/>
in <hi>Orientall Learning</hi> that have been, or are at
this day in the <hi>Chriſtian World?</hi> Such as we have
already mentioned, <hi>Cap. 1. Sect.</hi> 7. Can theſe
<hi>Opinions</hi> be counted <hi>private,</hi> which have been,
and are <hi>publikely</hi> aſſerted by men of ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
worth? or can their being mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Biblia Polyglotta,</hi> procure them more
credit and eſteem, then the <hi>venerable</hi> Names of
ſuch <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Learned</hi> men, with whom the
<hi>Publiſher</hi> of this <hi>Bible,</hi> and thoſe that aſſiſted
him, do not think themſelves fit to be named.
And if they might by theſe and others be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
in <hi>Print,</hi> and diſputed among <hi>Learned</hi>
men, why might they not be mentioned here?
and why might not the <hi>Publiſher</hi> deliver his <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
in theſe things, as well as others, eſpecially
writing with that moderation he uſes, not <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterially</hi>
impoſing a beliefe upon any, but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
every one to his own liberty, onely ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his reaſons, why he judges one <hi>opinion</hi> more
probable then another?</p>
               <p>VIII. He conceives he had a fit occaſion to
ſpeak of theſe things in the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> to this
Work, for ſeeing the <hi>Hebrew Text</hi> is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the whole <hi>Fabrick,</hi> for the <hi>Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
what was more proper then to ſpeak of
the <hi>Hebrew Tongue,</hi> the antiquity, uſe, excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and preſervation of it; how the Text came
to be <hi>pointed,</hi> what the <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Ketib</hi> are,
which appear in moſt <hi>Hebrew Bibles,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115995:19"/>
there are <hi>various Readings,</hi> both of the <hi>Old</hi>
and <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> noted in moſt <hi>Editions,</hi>
therefore to ſpeak of <hi>various Readings,</hi> whence
they came, out of what Copies, and how to be
gathered, and to adde to what others have done,
out of ſome <hi>ancient</hi> and <hi>choyce</hi> MSS. or <hi>printed
Copies,</hi> and to ſhew that the <hi>certainty</hi> and <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
of <hi>Scripture,</hi> with the <hi>integrity</hi> of the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
Texts,</hi> is not impeached or prejudiced
thereby, which he aſſerts upon ſuch foundations
as will hold, and not upon ſandy grounds, as his
Adverſary doth, which will not ſtand, not <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis
non cogentibus,</hi> by which the truth is more
prejudiced than by confeſſing the invalidity of
them; for when men ſee the weakneſs of them,
they think we have no better to rely upon, and
ſo begin to queſtion and doubt the truth of all.</p>
               <p>IX. As for his <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>jealouſies,</hi> I ſay, that
when they are <hi>groundleſſe,</hi> they are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
and that they are ſo, ſhall hereafter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear;
we have ſad experience of the fruits of
<hi>cauſeleſſe fears and jealouſies,</hi> which the more
unjuſt they are, the more violent uſually they
are, and leſs capable of ſatisfaction. It hath been,
and is uſual with ſome, who that they may create
<hi>fears</hi> in the <hi>credulous ignorant multitude,</hi> and
raiſe clamours againſt others, pretend great <hi>fears</hi>
of that which they themſelves no more fear then
the falling of the skies, and to cry out, <hi>Templum
Domini,</hi> when they ſcarce believe <hi>Dominum
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115995:19"/>
Templi,</hi> nor did the care of the Temple ever
enter into their hearts, onely by this artifice
they drive on their own Deſignes, and expoſe
their adverſaries to popular hatred. Thoſe that
read the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> (as he ſaith he hath done)
without prejudice, may find ſatisfaction enough
to prevent all <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>jealouſies:</hi> As for thoſe
that with the Spider ſuck poyſon out of the
ſweeteſt flowers from which the Bee gets honey,
I ſhall not trouble my ſelf to give them any
more ſatisfaction, they ſhal bear their own guilt;
I know the difference between <hi>Scandalum da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,
&amp; acceptum,</hi> and ſhall ſay of ſuch, as <hi>Chriſt</hi>
did of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> that were offended at his
Doctrine, <hi>Let them alone, they are blinde, leaders
of the blinde.</hi> Truth muſt not be concealed,
though weak men be offended at it, or wicked
men wreſt it to their own hurt.</p>
               <p>X. But he ſaith further, p. 150. <hi>What is there
that could poſſibly infect him with this leaven,</hi> viz.
<hi>of envie or malice;</hi> for, firſt, he <hi>neither profeſſes
any deep skill in the learning uſed in this Work, nor
is ever like to be ingaged in any thing that ſhould
be ſet up in competition with it:</hi> nor ſecondly, <hi>doth
he know the Authors and Contrivers of the Work,
nor did he ever know that there was ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
as the chief Author of this Edition but by it;</hi>
nor, thirdly, <hi>ſhall he fail upon all occaſions, to
commend the uſefulneſſe of the Work. With the
learning, pains, and diligence of thoſe worthy
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115995:20"/>
perſons that brought it forth.</hi> To all which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
Firſt, for his skill in this kinde of Learning,
I ſhall ſay nothing, but leave others to judge to
whom he is better known then to my ſelf, he is
one whom I never ſaw, nor, till of late years,
ever heard of, and till now, he was, <hi>mihi nec
beneficio nec male ficio notus,</hi> but the leſſe his skill
is in this kind of learning, I think the leſſe will
his cenſure be regarded among wiſemen, and I
ſhall have the leſſe cauſe to fear it. The <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi>
taxes ſome who would be <hi>teachers of the
law, not knowing what they ſaid, or whereof
they affirmed: I</hi> will not apply this to our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
but himſelf tells us, <hi>p. 324. that it is the
way of Scioliſts when they have obtained a little
skill in any language or ſcience to perſwade the
world, that all worth lies therein.</hi> Whether this
may agree to himſelf or no, I will not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
but leave every man to judge as he ſees
cauſe, but ſure I am, and experience makes it
good, that thoſe who have attained a little <hi>ſmat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
knowledge</hi> in any Science, eſpecially in
the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> are uſually more puft up with that
little <hi>umbratill knowledge,</hi> though weak men o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
and of little judgement in any reall or
rationall learning, then thoſe who have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a far greater meaſure, and that they are
more apt to cenſure and condemne others. I
have known ſome <hi>Citizens,</hi> yea women in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
who having learned to read <hi>Hebrew,</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:115995:20"/>
were ſo conceited of themſelves, that they have
deſpiſed the ableſt <hi>Divines</hi> about the <hi>City,</hi> and
have almoſt doubted of the ſalvation of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that could not read <hi>Hebrew;</hi> and I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that <hi>Schickard,</hi> a very learned <hi>Hebrician</hi>
tells us, that it is the guiſe of many, as ſoon as
they underſtand three words of <hi>Hebrew,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
they are ſo conceited of their own abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that they betake themſelves to the writing
of <hi>Grammars,</hi> and condemns himſelf for his folly
in that kind when he was but a <hi>novice,</hi> attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that of which he was afterward aſhamed;
He was then alſo as earneſt a <hi>Patron</hi> of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity</hi>
of <hi>Hebrew points,</hi> as our Author can
be, yet afterwards when he came to riper judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>he could not believe that any learned man
could in good earneſt maintain that opinion, but
that ſome did it meerely to ſhew their wit.</hi> This
is therefore no argument of our Adverſaries
freedome from ſiniſter ends and motives, that
his skill is not great in the languages, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proves the contrary, eſpecially when he
knows that men of the greateſt eminency in this
learning that the world ever had or hath at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
have ſaid the ſame with the Author of the
<hi>Prolegomena,</hi> and that the chiefeſt of our own
Nation in that learning have had ſome hand in,
or have at leaſt approved this Edition, and thoſe
things which he ſo much miſlikes. It might
have been fit for him, and no way unbecoming
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115995:21"/>
his greatneſſe to have forborn a while, and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſee what thoſe who are known to be of
great judgement in theſe matters, of which this
Nation hath more then ever heretofore, would
have ſaid, and what their judgement had been,
then for him, I (who <hi>I</hi> think will not think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
fit to be parallel'd with many) preſently to
engage with ſuch violence and to condemn opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
which as appears by his Diſcourſe, he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did not throughly weigh, or doth not fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

underſtand. But he that looks through a <hi>green
glaſſe,</hi> judges every thing <hi>green</hi> which he ſees,
when onely that is <hi>green</hi> through which he
looks.</p>
               <p>XI. As for his <hi>not knowing the authors and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers
of the work.</hi> Though they were not
known to him, yet they were known to be <hi>Sons
of the Church of England,</hi> and ſuch as have not
Apoſtatized from their former profeſſion, either
by <hi>Hereſie</hi> or <hi>Schiſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XII. For his commending the Work, and
the Authors of it, which he promiſes upon all
occaſions; his whole Diſcourſe ſhews what
his commendations are, when he charges the
Work with <hi>ſetting up Atheiſme, Popery, phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Antiſcripturiſme, Mahumetaniſme,</hi> p. 147.
<hi>with bringing in utter uncertainty in and about
all ſacred truth,</hi> Epiſt. p. 25. ſo that nothing
remains, but that we muſt <hi>either turn Papiſts or
Atheiſts.</hi> When he inveighs againſt all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115995:21"/>
tranſlations, <hi>as ſet up in competitions with
the Text,</hi> Epiſt. p. 9. <hi>to correct the word of God,
180. to correct the Scripture,</hi> p. 344. That they
<hi>will be found upon triall to be ſuch as many will
be ready to queſtion the foundation of all.</hi> p. 206.
when he tells us, <hi>of ſuch dreadfull diſtempers as
will prove mortal to the ſacred truth of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi>
p. 314. <hi>of horrible and outragious vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
offered to the ſacred Hebrew verity,</hi> p. 315.
and <hi>rather</hi> wiſhes that <hi>this and all other works
of this nature were out of the world, than one of
theſe ſhould be admitted.</hi> p. 221. Is this to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the worth and uſefulneſſe of it, and the
pains of the contrivers? what more bitter revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
ſpeeches could be uttered againſt the moſt
prophane <hi>Atheiſticall Pamphlets</hi> which this age
hath produced againſt <hi>Hobs</hi> his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> and
the like? What is this but to caſt dirt in ones
face, and yet to perſwade him that he did it not
to diſgrace him. <hi>Bern. in Cant.</hi> 2. ſpeaks of the
<hi>ſlanderer,</hi> that when he intends the moſt <hi>diſgrace</hi>
againſt any, begins firſt to commend him, which
kind of ſlander is ſaith he <hi>tanto plauſibilior,
quanto creditur ab iis qui audiunt, corde invito,
&amp; condolentis affectu proferri,</hi> when it ſerves but
as a foyl to what follows, &amp; as a ſhoeing horn to
draw on ſome diſgracefull aſperſion the better,
and make the crime be thought the greater,
<hi>Saint Cyprian Epiſt.</hi> 2. compares ſuch to <hi>wra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtlers,
qui antagoniſtas luctantes altius tollunt,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115995:22"/>
quo vehementius illidant, who lift their antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt
the higher, that they may give him the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fall.</hi> And therefore S. <hi>Hierome ad Pammach.
&amp; Ocean.</hi> ſaith, that ſuch commendation is <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norifica
contumelia, an honorable reproach.</hi> It
is <hi>callidum nocendi artificium,</hi> as another calls
it, <hi>a crafty kind of artifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e to do miſchief.</hi> In the
mean time it is ſome comfort when <hi>ne inimici
quidem vituperare poſſunt, niſi ſimul laudent,</hi> as
Plin. lib. 3. Ep. 12. <hi>when our very enemies, muſt
make our praiſes a preface to their ſlanders.</hi> If
theſe be his commendations, let him keep them
to himſelf.</p>
               <p>XIII. But he ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 161. that <hi>theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
are not charged upon the Workmen, but
upon the Work.</hi> But I ſay, if upon the Work
then upon the Workmen. The Work and the
Workmen are ſo nearly related, that what is
ſaid againſt the one muſt of neceſſity reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the other. If one ſhould publiſh in Print, that
himſelf in his Treatiſe, by rejecting what is by all
<hi>Chriſtians acknowledged for a main ground of
their believing the Scriptures to be from God,</hi> viz.
<hi>miracles, and the uninterrupted Tradition of the
Church, by equalling the Tradition of the Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,
for their Alcoran, with the tradition of the
Church for the Scriptures, and laying all upon
the light and power of the word it ſelf, doth thereby
make way for Atheiſts, and phanatick perſons, &amp;c.</hi>
and ſhould think to ſalve all with this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115995:22"/>
that he charges not the Author, but the
Book with theſe inferences, would not he think
himſelf concerned in the Charge, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
to be a meer mockery?</p>
               <p>XIV. The truth therefore is, whatſoever is
by him pretended, and ſo it is generally known
&amp; believed by all that know either him or thoſe
that had a hand in publiſhing this Work, That
his quarrel is chiefly with the <hi>perſons,</hi> and with
the <hi>Work</hi> for their ſakes, and that he therefore
ſeeks to depreſſe the worth of the Book, becauſe
ſuch men have had the honour to bring it forth.
Whereas had himſelf and thoſe of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
been the <hi>Publiſhers,</hi> it would have been
free from all theſe imputations, and cryed up as
the greateſt <hi>monument</hi> of <hi>Religion and learning;</hi>
which any age hath produced. Nor is it unlike,
but that there was ſome mixture of <hi>ambition</hi>
with envy, which pricked him forward, he
thought to raiſe his own credit upon the ruine
of this Work, and thereby to gain ſome reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
amongſt his diſciples, that ſo from the lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre
of this Work he might be better known and
admired. Nothing is more evident then that
he hath ſtudiouſly laboured to ſcrape together,
whatſoever might with any colour be objected
againſt it, and when he wanted reall grounds
for his calumnies, to feign whatſoever he
thought might render either it or the Publiſher
obnoxious to popular hatred, ſo that whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115995:23"/>
motives he had, it could not be the <hi>love of
the truth</hi> that ſtirred him up.</p>
               <p>XV. Whatſoever his ends or aims were, the
Work hath had approbation from all ranks of
men both at home and abroad, who are beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to judge of it, ſo that it need not fear his
cenſures, but will remain impregnable againſt
the aſſaults and batteries of all malignant ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
If this tree had not born good fruit, there
had been no ſtones thrown at it, for as <hi>Plut.
ubi nullum lumen, ibi nulla umbra, ubi nulla fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitas
ibi nulla invidia.</hi> I could produce the
judgement of the beſt learned in <hi>Europe,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
by ſeverall letters out of <hi>France, Germany,</hi>
the low Countries, <hi>Flanders, Italy</hi> and other
places concerning this work, that one ſtiles it
<hi>opus pluſquam Regium,</hi> another <hi>opus Divinum,</hi>
another <hi>opus Heroicum,</hi> &amp;c. but I will content
my ſelf at this time with the teſtimony of <hi>D.
Buxtorfe</hi> now <hi>Hebrew Profeſſor at Baſil,</hi> a man
inferior to none for his great skill in <hi>Hebrew</hi>
learning, and one with whom for divers years
I have had intercourſe by letters, and fair cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence,
notwithſtanding our difference in
judgement about the Hebrew punctation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
one whoſe teſtimony our adverſary cannot ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.
Thus he writes in one of his Letters:

This, and more to his purpoſe, writes this great

               <argument>
                  <p>I. The particulars of the Charge many, the principall are
about various Readings, and the Hebrew points. II. The
generall Charge of depreſsing the eſteem of the Hebrew
Copies proved falſe. III. Ten particular Charges in the
Conſiderations, proved to be falſe, the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legomena

the direct contrary to what is charged. The Adverſaries

               </argument>
               <p>I. WE come now to the particular <hi>Charges</hi>
and <hi>Criminations</hi> of the <hi>Conſiderator.</hi>
We find them ſeverall times muſtered up: firſt in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115995:24"/>
the <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> p. 9. then in the <hi>Conſideration,</hi> pag.
157, 158. and again, p. 205, 206. in all which
places, though many particulars are enumerated
to make the greater ſhew, yet in his Diſcourſe,
he chiefly inſiſts upon two things, <hi>viz.</hi> The
<hi>various readings</hi> of the <hi>Original Texts,</hi> and
the <hi>novelty of the Hebrew punctation,</hi> and in
the ſame Epiſt. p. 25. he reduces all to thoſe two
heads from which he deduces the <hi>uncertainty of
the Scriptures,</hi> The <hi>corruption of the Originalls,</hi>
and thoſe other <hi>conſequences</hi> which he would
faſten upon the <hi>Biblia Polyglotta.</hi> For our more
orderly proceeding, we ſhall firſt lay down the
ſeveral particulars charged upon the <hi>Prolegome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
as they are exhibited in the <hi>Conſiderations,</hi>
and then what it is w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is aſſerted or maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> and after we ſhall proceed
to the examination of the particulars.</p>
               <p>II. But before we enter upon the ſeveral heads,
we muſt conſider one <hi>generall Charge,</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>p.</hi> 205 and which includes moſt of the reſt,
<hi>viz. That excepting that figment of the</hi> Jews <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
the</hi> Bible, <hi>out of hatred to the</hi> Chriſtians,
<hi>and the Theſis prefering this or that tranſlation in
generall above the originall, there is no Opinion that
he knows of, that was ever ventilated among</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
<hi>tending to the depreſſion of the Worth, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
the eſteem of the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Copies, which is
not directly, or by juſt conſequence, owned in theſe</hi>
Prolegomina. This will appear to be moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115995:24"/>
in the ſeveralls, by him mentioned, when
we ſhall come to them, where we ſhall make it
appear, that the <hi>Hebrew Copies</hi> are not at all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached
by any thing maintained in the <hi>Prole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomena,</hi>
unleſſe he mean that ſome Cabaliſticall
myſteres, (or rather fopperies) from whence
ſtrange obſervations are drawn, to the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and perverting of the Scripture, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text to ſcorn and contempt are
not owned. Such Rabbinicall fancies taken up
by ſome <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> it is true, are rejected and
condemned, for the Publiſher doth not believe,
that the eſteem and worth of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text
is advanced by any untruth, or by the vain and
groundleſſe conceits of ſuch idle pretenders, but
rather impaired and leſſened; but as for the
<hi>due honour</hi> and <hi>integrity</hi> of the <hi>Originall</hi> Texts,
and preſerving the <hi>true eſteem</hi> of them to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
he doubts not, but that it will be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by all unprejudiced perſons, that he hath
done more then hath been hitherto done by any.</p>
               <p>III. After this <hi>generall Calumny,</hi> our Author

not upon the <hi>Maſorites,</hi> nor is it
therefore true, becauſe it is from

the Holy Ghoſt, which was dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               <argument>
                  <p>I. The firſt and main Charge, That the Originall Text hath
groſse corruptions. II Not any words brought out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legomena
to prove this, but Conſequences of his own. The
Prolegomena maintain expreſsely, That the Originalls are
not corrupt, either by Jews or others, either before or ſince
Chriſt. That caſuall miſtakes may happen by negligence in
matters of no moment, yet there are means to rectifie and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
them when diſcovered. III. The Prolegomena falſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
various Readings acknowledged by all, proved out of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
Uſher, Buxtorf. &amp;c. Granted by the Adverſary often,
yet ſometimes denied in the Hebrew. VI. Wherein the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the Conſiderations, and the Author of the Prolego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena
differ. The Adverſarie calls all various Readings
corruptions, and ſo makes the Originalls to be corrupt. Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Readings, not properly corruptions proved out of Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torf.
VII, VIII. His Arguments againſt various
Readings IX. Anſwered. They prove onely no wilfull
corruptions. X. The Talmud ſometimes, reads otherwiſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115995:28"/>
then in our Copies, proved by Buxtorf. Of our Saviours ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
about theſe things. XI. The care of the Church in
preſerving the Copies of the Bible. XII. XIII. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be no means of rectifying any error crept in, but
onely by revelation. That all Copies in publick uſe, agree in
all ſaving truth revealed, and in all matters hiſtoricall, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall,
&amp;c. of any weight, that other ſmaller differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
may be rectified. XIV. All revealed truth comes
under our care. XV. No one Copy can pretend to be a
ſtandard for all others. No vulgar Copy was in poſſeſsion
over all the world before Printing or ſince. XVI. The
uncertainty of the Adverſaries rule, viz. That every tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of revealed truth, is in one Copy or other. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>npoſsible to
examine all the Copies in the world.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>I. WE ſhall begin firſt with the main
Charge,</hi> viz. <hi>That the</hi> Originall
Texts are corrupted, yea have groſſe corruptions
befallen them. <hi>This he propounds ſometimes</hi>
doubtfully, <hi>p 147. He ſaith,</hi> the various Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
at the firſt view ſeem to intimate that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
have befallen the Originalls, <hi>and p.</hi> 159.
This voluminous bulk of various lections, as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly
exhibited, ſeems ſufficient to beget ſcruples
and doubts about the preſervation of the Scripture
by the care and providence of God. <hi>Now if they
do onely</hi> intimate, <hi>and</hi> ſeem to intimate corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>and onely</hi> ſeem ſufficient <hi>to beget</hi> ſcruples,
<hi>then they do not</hi> certainly <hi>infer any ſuch
Charge, and if they</hi> ſeem <hi>ſo, onely at the</hi> firſt
view, <hi>then upon a</hi> further view, <hi>it may be that
they will not</hi> ſeem to intimate corruptions. <hi>But
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115995:28"/>
though he ſpeak thus modeſtly ſometime, yet in
other places he charges home.</hi> p. 158. It is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
(in the <hi>Prolegomena)</hi> that when groſſe
faults or corruptions are befallen the Originalls,
men may by their faculty of criticall conjectures
amend them and reſtore the native lections that
were loſt. <hi>p.</hi> 206. That where groſſe faults are
crept into the Hebrew Text, men may by their
own conjectures find out various Readings, &amp;c.
<hi>Epiſt. p.</hi> 21. Their Principle is, that there are
ſundry corruptions crept into the Originalls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and this receives countenance from theſe <hi>Prolego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena:
So p. 311. 325. and in many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
he diſputes againſt this Poſition, as aſſerted
in the</hi> Biblia Polyglotta, That the Originall
Texts are corrupted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. But how is this</hi> Charge <hi>proved? Here
we may obſerve, that neither in this nor any
other of his Charges doth he relate any of the
words of the</hi> Prolegomena, <hi>which if he had done,
the falſhood had been diſcovered, but ſuppoſing
that the ordinary Reader would not trouble
himſelf to look into the</hi> Prolegomena, <hi>but take
all upon his word, he</hi> ſubſtitutes <hi>in the place
of his</hi> Adverſaries opinion, <hi>ſome of his own</hi>
conſectaries, <hi>which to him ſeemed to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
upon it, which he falls upon with great
violence, which kind of dealing is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,
to charge an Adverſary with</hi> conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>as his proper tenets, when he denies ſuch
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115995:29"/>
conſequences, eſpecially, when as he directly
and not by conſequence affirms, and maintains
the contrary to what is charged, yet this is our
caſe here. What the</hi> Author <hi>of the</hi> Prolegomena
<hi>delivered concerning the</hi> purity <hi>and</hi> authority <hi>of
the</hi> Originall Texts, <hi>is to be ſeen</hi> Proleg. 7. de
Textuum Originalium integritate &amp; auctorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,
<hi>and</hi> Proleg. 6. de variis lectionibus, <hi>whither
I muſt refer the Reader for full ſatisfaction. The
ſum is this (as hath been touched in part alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy).</hi>
1. That the Hebrew Text is not corrupted
by the Jews either before or after Chriſt. <hi>This is
proved by ſundry Reaſons, and amongſt others
by theſe,</hi> That is were againſt the providence of
God to permit the Scriptures to be corrupted, and
againſt the fidelity of the Church, to whoſe care
the ſacred Oracles are committed. That the Jews
neither did, nor could falſifie the Hebrew Text,
but that the fraud would have been preſently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.
That it is incredible <hi>(as Saint</hi> Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine
ſaith, De Civit. l. 13. c. 13. ipſos voluiſſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicibus
ſuis eripere veritatem, ut nobis eriperent
auctoritatem, vel in totum orbem diſperſos potu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſe
in hoc conſpirare nullo contradicente. <hi>This is
at large proved</hi> Proleg. 6. ſect. 1. 12. <hi>and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to the contrary anſwered.</hi> 2. That
neither the Hebrew nor Greek Texts of the
Old or New Teſtament are corrupted by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
or others, but that they remain pure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
and that they alwayes were and ſtill are the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115995:29"/>
authentick rule in all matters of faith and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that by them all, tranſlations are to be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and examined, <hi>to which end many arguments
are produced, among others, That</hi> God at the firſt
delivered to the Church, not Tranſlations, but
Originall Texts, and thoſe pure and free from all
corruption, and therefore thoſe that ſay they are
corrupt muſt prove them ſo to be, and ſhew when
and how they came to be corrupted, and how they
came to loſe that authority which they once had,
otherwiſe they are to be preſumed to be pure and
authentick, as being in poſſeſſion of their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
Nor can any generall corruption be proved
from a few particular inſtances, but onely the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall
errors of the Tranſcribers, which may well
conſiſt with the purity of the fountains. <hi>Proleg. 7.
Sect.</hi> 15, 16. 18. 22, 23. &amp;c. 3. That though by
the negligence or inadvertency of Tranſcribers
ſome caſuall miſtakes or involuntary errors may
creep into the Text, from whence various Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings

yet the Originall Text romains pure and

of any moment, whereby any point of faith

means wanting whereby ſuch erros may be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and the true Reading eſtabliſhed. That it was
not poſſible that any error ſhould have riſen in
matters of weight, but it would preſently have been
diſcovered, there being ſo many thouſands of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115995:30"/>
diſperſed all the world over, which were dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
read, expounded and conſidered of, and every
word weighed and examined, either in publick or
private by learned men and others in all ages, who
eſteemed theſe books as the Records of their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the grand Charter of their inheritance
in heaven; And for other miſtakes, there are means
to rectifie them when they are diſcovered, as the
Analogy of faith, the Writings and Comments
of the Ancients, Collation of ancient Copies, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting
ancient Tranſlations, eſpecially the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
it ſelf, the Comparing of parallel places, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
Antecedents and conſequents, &amp;c That
theſe various Readings ſeldome change the ſence,
or if they do, yet both are agreeable to the Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
of faith, and if, notwithſtanding theſe means,
both Readings ſeem equally ballanced, there can
be no danger, to follow which we will. <hi>Theſe
things are handled,</hi> Proleg. 6. Sect. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
&amp;c. <hi>and</hi> Proleg. 7. Sect. 15, 16, &amp;c.</p>

of the <hi>Originall Texts.</hi> Now ſeeing he

                  <hi>V. Here we ſee theſe two learned Patrons
of the purity of the Hebrew Text, affirm as
much as is ſaid in the</hi> Prolegomena: <hi>with them
concur all others that handle this Argument, for
though there have been two or three, as</hi> Pola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
<hi>and</hi> Pagnine, <hi>and ſome others that have
thought the Jewiſh Scribes ſo priviledged, as
never to have erred in the leaſt, yet this fancy
is generally now exploded by all. Nor ſhall I

them in the</hi> New Teſtament, <hi>as Epiſt. p.</hi> 27.
Why I pray is this ſo ridiculous? to grant that
there are corruptions and various Readings in the
Greek and Latine Copies of the Scripture, but
deny it as to the Hebrew) it is founded on no leſſe
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>table bottome then this experience, that whereas
we evidently find various lections in the Greek
Copies which we enjoy, and ſo grant that which
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115995:32"/>
ocular inſpection evinces to be true, yet they are
none of them able to ſhew out of any Copies yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
in the world, or that they can make appear
ever to have been extant; that ever there were
any ſuch various lections in the Originalls of the
old Teſtament: <hi>yet in other places (contradicting
himſelf, which is not unuſuall) he frequently
grants various Readings both in the Old and
New, p.</hi> 13. It is no doubt, but that in the Copies
we now enjoy of the old Teſtament there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
Readings. The Keri and Ketib the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
lections of <hi>Ben Aſcher</hi> and <hi>Ben Naphtali,</hi> of
the Eaſtern and Weſtern Jews, which we have
collected at the end of the Bible evince it <hi>p.</hi> 178.
Notwithſtanding we grant that there are, and
have been various lections in the old Teſtament
and the new. The Keri &amp; Ketib, the various
Readings of <hi>Ben Aſcher,</hi> and <hi>Ben Naphtali,</hi> the
Orientall and Occidentall Jews: And if any
other can be gathered, or ſhall hereafter out of

ſome Copies of the New Teſtament, and thoſe ſome

of tranſcribers of</hi> Heathen <hi>Authors,</hi> Homer,

<hi>the</hi> Romane <hi>Pontifices would not do it negligently
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:115995:37"/>
nor treacherouſly,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> It is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
but that the Church of Chriſt had a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
care, that the Copies tranſcribed, for publike
uſe eſpecially, ſhould be free from all errors,
as much as could be, and that far more care was
taken about them, then ever was taken by any
about the writings of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> nor do I
know any who affirm the contrary. It is true,
this argument is uſed by ſome, that the <hi>various
Readings</hi> in ſuch Authors, in matters of leſſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
do not make all their <hi>Philoſophy, Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>uncertain,</hi> and therefore the like <hi>vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Readings</hi> in ſome Copies of the Scripture,
doth not make the Scripture <hi>uncertain,</hi> or prove
it to be <hi>corrupt;</hi> but what is this to the care and
fidelity of the Church in preſerving the Copies
of the Scripture, which all acknowledge to be
more then any had, or could have in preſerving
any humane Writings, the <hi>Sybils</hi> verſes, or any
other of the <hi>Heathens</hi> pretended <hi>Oracles.</hi> But
though their care was great, and therefore no

That the ſaving doctrine of the Scriptures, as to

or any tolerable evidence that ever there were
any other in the leaſt differing from theſe extant

a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Proteſtant Divine.—The
nature of this doctrine is ſuch, that there is
no other principle or means of diſcovery, no other
rule or meaſure of judging and detrmining any
thing about it, but onely the writing from whence
it is taken, it being wholly of Divine revelation,
which is onely expreſſed in Scripture; ſo that
upon ſuppoſall of any corruption, there is no mean
of rectifying it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as there is in correcting a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
in any Probleme of <hi>Euclide,</hi> &amp;c. Nor is i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Word of God muſt come unde our care and

Conſideration. <hi>He provides us therefore better
ſecurity,</hi> p. 198. He tells us of a Copie which
was a ſtandard to try all others by. The Vulgar
Copy we uſe, was the publike poſſeſſion of many
generations, and upon the invention of <hi>Printing,</hi>
it was in actuall poſſeſſion throughout the world.
This muſt paſſe for a ſtandard, which confeſſedly
is its right and due. <hi>But,</hi> p. 173. <hi>we are referred</hi>
to all the Copies that are remaining; In them all
we ſay, is every letter and title of the Word of
God: Theſe Copies are the rule, ſtandard and
touchſtone of all Tranſlations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIII. For anſwer, Firſt, for what <hi>Capellus</hi>
affirms, I am not bound to anſwer, he was able
enough to anſwer for himſelf while he was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and now he is dead, every one will trample
upon a dead Lyon, who durſt not look him in
the face while he was alive. But as for the <hi>Prole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomena,</hi>
I do not onely ſay, that all <hi>ſaving fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
truth</hi> is contained in the Originall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,
but that all revealed truth is ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
entire; or, if any error or miſtake have
crept in, it is in matters of no concernment,
ſo that not onely no matter of faith, but no
conſiderable point in Hiſtoricall truth, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies
or other things, is thereby prejudiced,
and that there are means left for rectifying any
ſuch miſtakes where they are diſcovered, as hath
been often ſaid. Secondly, To ſay, that upon
any corruption in the <hi>ſaving doctrine</hi> ſuppoſed,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115995:38"/>
there is no means of rectifying or reſtoring, is a
very ſtrange aſſertion; may not the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Antecedents</hi> and <hi>Conſequents,</hi> of places <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel,</hi>
of the <hi>analogie of faith,</hi> the <hi>teſtimonies, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions</hi>
&amp; <hi>Tranſlations</hi> of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> &amp;c. help
to rectifie a corruption crept in, and may we
not judge by one part of revealed truth of what
agrees with it, or diſagrees from it, as by any
<hi>Theoreme</hi> of <hi>Euclide,</hi> what is agreeable with it,
or diſagreeable, though the one be by reaſon,
the other by revelation? Is there no uſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in matters of faith? or in judging of Divine
truths? <hi>Vedelius</hi> might have ſpared his labour
of a <hi>Rationale,</hi> if this be ſo. It is confeſſed by
all, that <hi>various Readings</hi> are found in the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
Texts,</hi> which ſeverall readings cannot
both be from the ſacred Pen-men, but the one
muſt needs be <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>erroneous,</hi> and if in ſuch
ſmalleſt things (all being of <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi>
the leaſt as well as the weightieſt) no way can
be found to rectifie any miſtake without a <hi>new
Revelation,</hi> the Scriptures are in an ill condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for by this means, no error once got in,
can ever be amended or corrected.</p>
               <p>XIV. Nor is it any where ſaid in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legomena,</hi>
that there is any corruption in any
fundamentall truth crept into the Originall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,
or in any ſaving doctrine, whereby it may
need rectifying or reſtoring, nay, the contrary
is both maintained and proved; yea, that in no
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115995:39"/>
matter of moment there is any variety in the
Copies, and though we grant leſſer varieties to
appear, (which is confeſſed by all) yet we deny
not, but that every tittle of the Word, though
never ſo ſmall, comes under our care, and ought
not to be neglected; but for all the care we can
uſe, ſuch leſſer varieties will happen, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>involuntary</hi> and of <hi>little</hi> or <hi>no importance</hi> to
the <hi>ſence</hi> or <hi>matter,</hi> neither the <hi>providence</hi> of
God is there prejudiced, nor the <hi>care</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> to be called in queſtion.</p>
               <p>XV. But what better ſecurity gives he againſt
the <hi>uncertainty</hi> ariſing from theſe <hi>varieties?</hi>
To make one Copy a <hi>ſtandard</hi> for all others, in
which no miſtake in the leaſt can be found, he
cannot, no Copy can plead this priviledge ſince
the firſt <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> were in being, ſo it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
by <hi>Buxtorf</hi> and <hi>Bootius,</hi> his beſt Authors;
nor can he tell us where this copy is to be found
to which we muſt have recourſe, and in which
every tittle is entire and perfect; ſome Copies
there have been more correct then others,
which deſerve all due regard, but to finde one
that is free from all miſtakes, even in the leaſt,
he will finde a hard task; yea, <hi>Buxtorf</hi> grants
it impoſſible, as we have ſeen. What that <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Copy</hi> was, which before <hi>Printing</hi> was inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
was in <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> all the <hi>world over</hi> for many
generations, and muſt paſſe for a <hi>ſtandard,</hi> I
would gladly know, and where it is to be found,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115995:39"/>
and ſhould very much eſteem it, if it could be
ſhewed; but this, I doubt, will prove an <hi>Euto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi>
conceit: For, doth our Adverſary think
there was no difference in the Copies that were
in uſe before <hi>Printing;</hi> the collation of all MSS.
<hi>Copies</hi> ſhews this to be falſe, let him produce
any two that are the ſame in every thing: Or
doth he think, that thoſe that firſt Printed the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek Text</hi> had onely one <hi>Copy,</hi>
and did not collate divers of the beſt they could
finde; or, that there is no difference in the
Printed Copies, I mean, not <hi>Typographicall</hi> er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
but ſuch as were in the Copies which they
followed. If any ſuch <hi>ſtandard</hi> were in being,
ſurely we have it printed in ſome <hi>Edition</hi> of the
<hi>Bible:</hi> Is it for the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, the <hi>Venice

<hi>Munſters,</hi> or <hi>Stephanus,</hi> or the <hi>Regia,</hi> or
<hi>Plantines,</hi> or which of theſe? And for the <hi>Greek,</hi>
let him declare whether it be <hi>Eraſmus</hi> his Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or the <hi>Complutenſe,</hi> or <hi>Stephens,</hi> or <hi>Bezaes,</hi>
or which it is, for that there are varieties &amp; dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
among them all, is evident, and cannot
be denied, neither let him ſay, the <hi>differences</hi> be
of no <hi>moment,</hi> for this is ſaid in the <hi>Prolegome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
with which he is not ſatisfied. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which he tells us of a Copy which muſt be
a <hi>ſtandard</hi> for all others in every thing, and was
in <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> all the world over, is a meer <hi>Chimae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi>
a groundleſſe fancie, and a vain imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115995:40"/>
of that which never was ſince the <gap reason="foreign">

were in being.</p>
               <p>XVI. But if he fly to his other refuge, and ſay,
that in all the copies extant, that is in ſome
one or other, every the leaſt <hi>iota</hi> and <hi>tittle</hi> is to
be found, then we are left <hi>more uncertain,</hi> for
then we muſt have all the Copies that are any
where throughout the world, and muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them all together before we can find all
the entire truth of God, for if we want but
one Copy, there may be ſomething in that
which differs from the reſt, and ſo we can have
no certainty in the reſt; Now all men know
this to be impoſſible to get together all Copies
whatſoever, and never to be expected, and
therefore upon this ground, it is impoſſible to
attain any certainty about all and every title of
the word of God, or ſuppoſe we had all the
Copies extant in the world, and could compare
them together, yet where they differ, how ſhall
we by any directions he gives us, know which
Copy is right in this particular, and which in
that. Theſe ways then which he propounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
invalid and inſufficient, I appeal to any whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be not more ſatisfactory, to ſay that we
have all ſaving truth preſerved in the Copies,
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are in <hi>common</hi> and <hi>publick uſe</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that they are free from all errors
in matters of moment, and that in other matters
there are wayes and means to judge of the beſt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115995:40"/>
reading, and what is moſt genuine, wherein
our induſtry is to be uſed, and if there be ſome
places wherein both Readings render the ſence
ſo, that we cannot tell which to prefer, (both
being agreeable to the <hi>Analogy of faith,</hi> and
neither of them repugnant to any other place
of Scripture) that there is no danger to chuſe
which we will, and whether there be any ſuch
danger in this aſſertion as is pretended? Our
Author himſelf confeſſes, <hi>p.</hi> 300. that <hi>in ſome
of the Keries and Ketibs there is a difference in
the ſences, yea that ſome have quite contrary
ſignifications, as</hi>

this, that <hi>neither of them is contrary to the analogy

why may it not be ſo for the reſt? This,
and leſs then this he confeſſes is enough for
<hi>Tranſlations,</hi> and why this, which we have laid
down may not ſerve for the <hi>Originalls</hi> I cannot
ſee, ſeeing the peoples faith is immediately gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> and not one of a thouſand

                  <p>I. The ſecond Charge, that we ſay, That our preſent Copies
are not the ſame with thoſe anciently uſed. II. The
Prolegomena affirm and prove that our Copies are the ſame.
III. Various Readings gathered out of Tranſlations do not
prove the contrary. IV. That all books whatſoever except

                     </gap> are ſubject to various Readings, yet the
ſame books. V. All differences of a Tranſlation from the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall,
are not various Readings. VI. A third Charge. That
the ſame fate hath attended the Scripture with other books,
This a pure Calumny. VII. Archbiſhop Uſher, Buxtorf, and
others, ſay the ſame with the Prolegomena. VIII. The
Prolegomena often acknowledged Gods ſpeciall providence
over theſe books. IX. A fourth Charge, that we may cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
the Originall upon Conjectures, proved a calumny out
of the Adverſaries words. X. The Prolegomena ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsely
maintain the contrary.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>I. WE proceed now to his other</hi> Charges.
<hi>The next is,</hi> That we ſay, that our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Copies are not the ſame with thoſe anciently
uſed. <hi>p.</hi> 206. That the old Tranſlators had other
Copies or differing Copies from them which we now
enjoy. <hi>p.</hi> 311. which did really differ from thoſe
we now enjoy and uſe, <hi>and Epiſt p.</hi> 10. which are
utterly loſt. <hi>This though in a manner coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
with the former, is yet diſtinctly propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and ſo we ſhall diſtinctly handle it. It is
indeed ſo groſſe a calumny, that the Author
of it confeſſes p.</hi> 312. That he doth not remember
that the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> do any where expreſſely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that they of old had other Copies then thoſe
we now enjoy, <hi>and therefore he would gather it
by conſequence for ſome other Poſition main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

<hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> Prolegomena <hi>affirm,</hi> That various Readings
may ſometimes be gathered out of ſome ancient
Tranſlations, <hi>which the Adverſary thus expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
very untruly, as we ſhall ſhew anon,</hi> That
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115995:41"/>
by the help and uſe of Tranſlations conjecturing
how they read in their books, either with other
words or leters, conſonants or points we may col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
various lections, as out of the Originall, which
opinion he ſees not how upon the matter it differs
from that of <hi>Capellus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. I anſwer 1. Not to queſtion how truly
he charges <hi>Capellus,</hi> who no where that I know
affirms this, but rather deprecates it as a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny,</hi>
whereas he ſaith he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> do any where
expreſſely ſay, that they had other Copies
of old, he could not but remember where
they expreſly ſay yea, and prove the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<hi>Proleg. 7. Sect.</hi> 16. (which p. 146. he ſaith
he hath looked through) There, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
noted, it is proved <hi>that the Copies we now
have are the true true Tranſcripts of the</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and the very
ſame,</hi> and therefore here we have another proof
of our Authors <hi>candor</hi> and <hi>ſincerity,</hi> impoſing
upon his Adverſary as his proper tenents, his
own <hi>illogicall conſequences,</hi> when he knew that
his Adverſary directly and not by conſequence
maintains the contrary. But this is familiar
with him, to deduce any odious conſequences
from his Adverſaries aſſertion, which he never
goes about to prove, becauſe it cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
but takes it for granted, and upon that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
againſt his Adverſary, when as indeed he
fights with his own ſhadow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:115995:42"/>
III. What is held in the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> about
gathering <hi>various Readings</hi> ſometimes out of
<hi>Tranſlations</hi> ſhall be diſcuſſed in its due place,
at preſent I do utterly deny his Conſequence,
for whereas all the <hi>various Readings</hi> of any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
are maintained to be onely in matters of <hi>no
weight</hi> or <hi>concernment,</hi> and ſuch as were at firſt
<hi>caſuall</hi> errors or <hi>miſtakes</hi> of <hi>Tranſcribers,</hi> as
is already ſhewed, and that thoſe that may be
gathered out of <hi>Tranſlations</hi> are of the ſame
nature and quality, if this be ſufficient to prove
that our Copies are not the ſame, then thoſe
that are likewiſe gathered out of the <hi>Originalls,</hi>
or have been, as the <hi>Keri and Ketib,</hi> and the
like, (which are admitted by our Author) will
likewiſe prove that we have not the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
of the <hi>Originalls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. Nay, if this Argument be ſufficient, then
it will prove that we have no true Copies of any
books in the world, for there were never any
yet (except the holy <hi>Pen-men)</hi> which have
been ſo priviledged, that the <hi>Tranſcriber</hi> could
not erre, or that <hi>various Readings,</hi> after frequent
<hi>Tranſcriptions,</hi> might not be gathered. Then
farewell not onely Scripture, but all other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents,
either of <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Humane</hi> learning:
Then we have no true Copies of the Writings
of any of the <hi>Fathers, Commentators, Councels,</hi>
nor of any <hi>Authors</hi> of <hi>Philoſophy, Law, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
Mathematicks, Hiſtory, &amp;c.</hi> but all the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115995:42"/>
old and genuine Copies are loſt, and thoſe we
have are <hi>corrupt, ſpurious</hi> and <hi>falſe,</hi> and ſo the
foundation of all <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>humane learning</hi> is
at once quite taken away. <hi>Buxtorf,</hi> as I have
ſhewed, and others the moſt rigid defenders of
the <hi>Hebrew Text,</hi> maintain that our preſent Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
are the ſame with the firſt <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and yet
ſtick not to confeſſe that they agree not in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing, but that there may be ſome variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in ſmaller matters, yea, that they ſhould agree
in every tittle, <hi>Buxtorf.</hi> ſaith it is impoſſible.
I would fain know what it is, that makes a Copy
not to be the ſamewith the <hi>Originall?</hi> muſt there
not be ſome <hi>ſubſtantiall difference,</hi> and that in
matters of weight &amp; importance that muſt make
ſuch a Change? ſhall every difference of a word
or a letter, it may be once in nine or ten pages
work this ſtrange <hi>Metamorphoſis?</hi> Who ever
affirmed ſuch <hi>Paradoxes?</hi> Is not a man the ſame
<hi>individuum,</hi> when his hair is cut or his nails pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that he was before, nay though his skin be
ſcratched or ſome blood drawn? Why then
is not a <hi>Copy</hi> the ſame with the <hi>Originall,</hi> though
there be ſome ſmall difference in things not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the ſumme or ſubſtance of the Book?
are not our Statute-books and Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
now printed, the ſame with the Originall
Copies, though the Writers or Printers be not
infallible, but it may be have in ſome words or
letters of no concernment, by caſuall miſtake, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115995:43"/>
from the Originalls: Beſides this, doth not
our Adverſary grant that errors and caſuall
miſtakes have happened in matters of leſſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
from whence various readings are ſprung,
which by his own Logick ſhould make the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
not to be the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V. Bu. from whence doth he draw this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.
From this,</hi> That by the help and uſe
of Tranſlations conjecturing how they read in their
Books either with other words or letters, Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
or points, we may collect various Readings,
as out of the Originall. <hi>But this is moſt</hi> partially
<hi>and</hi> untruly <hi>by him propounded, and no where
affirmed in the</hi> Prolegomena. <hi>For 1. as we have
already ſaid, all differences of a</hi> Tranſlation <hi>from
the</hi> Originall, <hi>are not to be reckoned among</hi>
various Readings. <hi>Prol. 6. Sect.</hi> 8. 11. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes
of the Tranſlator, his Paraphraſticall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
adding or omitting ſome words which he
judged needful or needleſs to the ſence, the errors of
the ſcribe, &amp;c. muſt be accurately diſtinguiſht from
the various Readings, but when no probable cauſe
can be given why the Tranſlator ſo rendred ſome
places, ſave the ambiguity of ſome words for want
of points, or the affinity of ſome letters in form or
ſound, or transpoſition of a letter, or the like,
(in which caſes a change may eaſily happen) there
we may well gather that the Copies varied, and
that the Tranſlator read he words ſo in his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
as they are by him rendered. <hi>Nor 2. Do we ſay,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115995:43"/>
that they always read with</hi> other letters or words,
conſonants or points; for this might infer that all
differences of Tranſlations are from the difference
of Copies, becauſe all conſiſt in other letters or
words, but when the letters are alike in figure or
ſound, or there is only a Metatheſis of the ſame let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
or ambiguity of a word without points, a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
might eaſily happen in the Copies. <hi>Nor 3. Do
we ſay,</hi> we may gather the various Readings, as
out of the Originalls, for there is an expreſſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
made between thoſe gathered out of the
Originalls, and thoſe out of Tranſlations, and
of theſe its ſaid, <hi>Proleg. 6. Sect.</hi> 8. Non pari cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinis
gradu incedere, they are not of the ſame
certainty with the other: <hi>ſo that we ſee herein is
nothing true either in the premiſſes or in the
Concluſion. I leave therefore this Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

               <p>
                  <hi>VI. In the third place, he charges us with
ſaying,</hi> That the ſame fate hath attended the
Scripture in its tranſcription, as hath done other
Books. <hi>p. 173. and p.</hi> 206. That the Books of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
have had the fate of other books, by paſſing
through the hands of many tranſcribers, <hi>for this he
refers to</hi> Prol. 7. Se. 12. <hi>but never cites the words,
&amp; yet addes p.</hi> 173. This imagination aſſerted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
deliberation ſeems to me to border upon atheiſm,
ſurely the promiſe of God for preſervation of his
Word, with his love &amp; care of his Church, of whoſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115995:44"/>
faith and obedience that word is the rule, requires
other thoughts at our hands? <hi>In this, we finde
the like</hi> truth <hi>and</hi> candor <hi>as in the reſt: For
firſt, He makes us to ſpeak that of the</hi> Scripture
<hi>in generall, which is onely ſpoken of one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
wilfully leaving out that (as he knows
who did of old) which would have proved all
to be a pure calumny. The words are,</hi> Nam in

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VII. The words precedent are,</hi> Et ſi textus

Nam in hiſce ſacra volumina idem fatum cum
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:115995:44"/>
aliis ſubiiſſe, <hi>&amp;c. What is more ſaid here
then was ſaid by all others before, that have
written of</hi> various Readings? Buxtorf Sixtin
Amama, <hi>and others, whoſe words are brought
in the ſame,</hi> Prolegom. 6. de variis lectionibus,

               <p>VIII. As for Gods ſpeciall providence in

have read in the ſame <hi>Prolegomena 6. Sect.

are cited the words of the Learned
<hi>Bochartus</hi> in that admirable Work of his,
<hi>Geogr. Sacr.</hi> Part. 1. lib. 2. c. 13. who, after he
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115995:45"/>
had ſaid the ſame, with the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> of <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Readings</hi> in the Scripture, as in other

ſint.</hi> I appeal to all men, even to the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
himſelf, what could be ſaid more fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Gods admirable preſervation of theſe
Books, and whether he hath not abuſed the
Reader and Publiſher in this crimination. The
Publiſher wrote upon <hi>deliberation,</hi> and need not
retract any thing. I wiſh his Adverſary had as
well conſidered what he hath charged him with,
for then the labour of both might have been
ſpared.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IX. The ninth thing charged upon the</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legomena,
<hi>is</hi> p. 206. That when groſſe faults are
crept into the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text; men may by their
own conjectures, finde out various Readings, and
<hi>p.</hi> 159. It is declared, that where any groſſe
faults or corruptions are befallen the Originalls,
men may by their faculty of criticall conjecturing
amend them, and reſtore the native lections that
are loſt, though, in generall, without the authority
of Copies this be not allowed. <hi>For this he quotes,</hi>
Prolegom. 7. Sect 12. <hi>I ſee our Author is ſtill</hi>
ſemper idem, <hi>a thred of</hi> untruth <hi>and</hi> calumny
<hi>runs through the whole Book; yet in this, of
gathering</hi> various Readings <hi>upon</hi> meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures
<hi>he is leſſe excuſable then in ſome
of the reſt, not onely becauſe this whole
charge is plainly rejected and diſproved in</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legom.
6. Sect. ult. <hi>and reaſons are given why
it cannot be allowed; but alſo becauſe the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
acquits the Author of the</hi> Prolegomena
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115995:46"/>
                  <hi>of it in other places, and acknowledges the
ſame with thanks, for within two leafs he writes,</hi>
p. 209. Indeed, I do not find his <hi>(Capellus)</hi> boldneſs
in conjecturing approved in the <hi>Prolegom. Why
do you then charge them with it? you might
have ſaid, you found it rejected and diſproved.
Again,</hi> p. 305. That they <hi>(Keri</hi> and <hi>Ketib)</hi> are moſt
of them criticall amendments of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> is
not allowed <hi>(by the Prolegomena)</hi> for which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of his determination, we thank the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Author <hi>p.</hi> 307. In the mean time, I cannot
but rejoyce that <hi>Capellus</hi> his fancy about theſe
things <hi>(about conjecturing)</hi> then which I know
nothing more pernicious to the truth of God, is not
allowed. <hi>Thus you ſee we are accuſed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
by the ſame Pen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>X. But yet for proof, he refers us to <hi>Prole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomena
7. Sect.</hi> 12. where I deſire the Reader to
ſee if there be one word, either of groſſe faults,
or of amending by conjectures, unleſſe as I ſaid
before, <hi>errata &amp; mendae leviores</hi> do ſignifie groſs
faults, <hi>&amp; quae ex aliis codicibus aliiſque mediis
de quibus ſupra emendari poſſunt,</hi> do ſignifie <hi>the
amendment of them by mens own conjectures.</hi> Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in that, <hi>p.</hi> 159 now cited, it may be obſerved,
that he confutes his charge in the propounding
of it; for he ſaith, this way of correcting upon
<hi>conjectures,</hi> in generall, without the authority of
<hi>Copies</hi> is not allowed of, which is a plain confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of it ſelf; for none ever denied, but that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115995:46"/>
errors in one Copy might be corrected by other
Copies, and how then are they to be found out
and corrected by mens own conjectures? But
thus he variouſly relates the opinion of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary,
that either he might make his opinion
hatefull to his unwary Reader, who happily
might not read both places, or elſe that he might
have a ſtarting hole, if he ſhould be challenged
for <hi>falſifying,</hi> ſaying, that in another place he
related all truly, and yet that relation is no
leſſe contradictory to it ſelf, then the other is
falſe; for to reſtore a reading by meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures,
and to reſtore it by another Copy, is
a plain contradiction.</p>

ſee, <hi>Prolegom 5. De verſionibus Scripturae,</hi>
where it is proved out of <hi>Theodoret, Hierom,

the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine.</hi> And concerning the uſe

works of God in their own Tongue:
Secondly, the wonderfull conſent of all <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations</hi>
in all things of moment, though made
at ſeverall times, and in ſeverall Nations ſo far
diſtant from one another, joyned together, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the ſame common faith, proves theſe
Books to be of <hi>Divine Originall,</hi> and to have
no other Author but God, who ſo wonderfully
preſerved them among ſo many <hi>changes</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions,</hi>
againſt the fury and malice of <hi>Satan,</hi>
and all his inſtruments, perſecuting <hi>Tyrants</hi>
and ſubtill <hi>Heretikes</hi> and <hi>Sectaries,</hi> who labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
either to corrupt, or aboliſh the ſame:
Thirdly, they bear witneſſe to the <hi>integrity</hi> of
the <hi>Originall Texts,</hi> by their <hi>conſent</hi> and <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
therewith, as is ſhewed in divers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
where ſome would have them to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,

others: as alſo to preſerve them <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire</hi>
to after ages, and to prevent the <hi>corrupting</hi>
of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either by the fraud of <hi>Heretikes,</hi> or

miſtakes could paſſe in all, and ſo many Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlatious,

as it was underſtood in thoſe times, when
they were made, eſpecially as they are exhibited
in this Work, where they may at <hi>one view,</hi> be
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115995:49"/>
all compared together, for if the <hi>Commentaries</hi>
of particular learn'd men deſerve all due regard,
much more thoſe <hi>Tranſlations</hi> (which alſo are
often <hi>paraphraſticall)</hi> which repreſent the ſence
of ſo many <hi>great and famous ancient Churches:</hi>
eſpecially thoſe in the <hi>Eaſtern tongues,</hi> which
becauſe of their nearneſſe and affinity with the

<hi>energy</hi> of divers words and phraſes in Scripture,
and becauſe of their <hi>Antiquity</hi> and generall

<hi>Chriſtians.</hi> This is the ſum of what is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
concerning <hi>Tranſlations</hi> in generall there,
or of any in particular elſewhere, with which
how that agrees with which our Adverſary
charges the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> of correcting the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginalls,
yea of correcting the Word of God
by them, may eaſily appear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IV. Before we come to his Reaſons againſt</hi>

things I ſhall premiſe, by which the Reader
may ſee both the</hi> untruths <hi>in the</hi> Charge, <hi>and
the</hi> invalidity <hi>of his</hi> Reaſons. 1. <hi>Though we
grant, that</hi> various Readings <hi>may be ſometimes
gathered out of Tranſlations, yet we do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
nor doth it preſently follow, that the</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Reading <hi>is</hi> corrupt <hi>or</hi> falſe, <hi>or muſt forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
be corrected by the</hi> Tranſlation. <hi>For
though there were ſome difference in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,
yet it may be, the reading of our preſent
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115995:49"/>
Copies is the better, and therefore is not to be
altered. Nay it is acknowledged and aſſerted
in the</hi> Prolegomena, <hi>that the</hi> preſent Reading
<hi>being in</hi> poſſeſſion <hi>of its</hi> authority <hi>ought not to
be altered, though other Copies have formerly
read otherwiſe, unleſſe it can be</hi> evidently and
clearly proved <hi>that ſome fault is crept into
the</hi> preſent Reading, <hi>and that we ought not to
depart from the</hi> uſuall Reading <hi>upon</hi> meere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures,

in Automato concedere.</p>
               <p>V. By all this it appears, that the <hi>Prolegome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
do not <hi>equall</hi> the <hi>Tranſlations</hi> with the
<hi>Text,</hi> or make this one end of <hi>Tranſlations,</hi>
thereby to <hi>correct</hi> the <hi>Text,</hi> or as is moſt invidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
expreſt, <hi>to correct the Scripture, to correct
the Word of God.</hi> For though it be affirmed,
that in ſome caſes <hi>various Readings</hi> may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
out of Tranſlations, yet there is more to
be conſidered, before any change may be made
of the <hi>preſent reading,</hi> for it muſt firſt be proved
that the <hi>preſent reading</hi> contains ſomething <hi>falſe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115995:50"/>
and abſurd,</hi> and cannot poſſibly ſtand, and then
which other things are to be conſidered, beſides
the bare reading of a <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> the <hi>antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi>

6. Sect. 6. among which, this alſo is one, which
our Adverſary takes notice of, and ſeems to carp

to alter any thing in the received Reading, though
he ſeem to have never ſo ſtrong Reaſons, but the

for no error is part of the <hi>Originall</hi> Text,

thoſe that attend that Work, can it be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaid, that they <hi>correct the Word of God,</hi> when
they correct onely the <hi>miſtakes</hi> of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitor,
and ſo when the ſheet is paſt the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors</hi>
hand, and is Printed off; if ſome by a
more exact view ſhall ſtill find ſome errors,
which need further correction, may this be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to him, that he preſumes <hi>to correct the
Word of God?</hi> who would not think this to be
ridiculous? yet ſuch is the reaſon of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary.
What is known and confeſt to be the
Word of God, it muſt be madneſs and impiety
in any to go about to correct it, but when an
error by negligence of the Tranſcriber or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhall have crept in, and it ſhall be proved to
be an error, muſt not this be amended or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
but preſently we are guilty of <hi>correcting
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115995:51"/>
the Scripture or Word of God?</hi> To correct the
<hi>Originall</hi> by a <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> is to alter what is
the true Reading of the <hi>Originall</hi> by a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation,
that ſo it may agree with the <hi>Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
for ſo our Author would have his Reader
underſtand it, and an ordinary Reader will make
no other ſence of his words; but is this the ſame
with <hi>reſtoring the true and native Reading,</hi> and
to ſay, that not onely other Copies, but even
<hi>Tranſlations</hi> may conduce to this end.</p>
               <p>VII. It is one thing to make uſe of a <hi>Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
about the true Reading of a place, when
any doubt ariſes, another thing to make it <hi>equal</hi>
with the Text; it may be made uſe of, when other
Copies or pregnant &amp; apparent reaſons concur,
but in this caſe it is not made <hi>equall</hi> with, but
<hi>ſubſervient</hi> to the <hi>Text:</hi> To equall it with the
<hi>Text,</hi> or prefer it, is to correct the <hi>Text</hi> by
it in all things wherein they differ, as ſome
<hi>Romaniſts</hi> ſay of the <hi>vulgar Latine</hi> (I ſay ſome,
for the learnedſt among them deny it, and of
thoſe that affirm it, none ever yet attempted it)
But this had been ſenceleſs and abſurd in our
caſe, when there are diverſe <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> and
thoſe in ſome things differing from one another,
for it is impoſſible to conform the <hi>Text</hi> to them
all, aud therefore could never be by us intended.
Here is then no <hi>Altar</hi> ſet up by Gods <hi>Altar,</hi>
nor any preferring of <hi>mans</hi> care and wiſdome
before the care and Wiſdome of <hi>God,</hi> but the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115995:52"/>
preſerving of Gods <hi>Altar,</hi> that it may not be
thruſt by, or any other ſet in its place, and the
uſing of our <hi>care</hi> and <hi>diligence,</hi> with that reaſon
which <hi>God</hi> hath given us, in a ſubſerviencie to
his <hi>care</hi> and <hi>Providence.</hi> Nor is this to <hi>defame</hi>
the <hi>Text,</hi> when we labour to preſerve the <hi>purity</hi>
of it, and to reſtore it to its <hi>Originall integrity,</hi>
when it can appear the <hi>Tranſcribers</hi> have failed,
and ſo to <hi>Tranſmit</hi> it to Poſterity. By this
means we maintain the <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>Text,</hi> and
do what we can to prevent any miſtakes for the
future, wherein whether more be not done in
this <hi>Edition</hi> then hath been done hitherto by
others, I appeal to the judgement of all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall
and judicious Readers.</p>
               <p>VIII. We never ſaid, That all differences of
the Tranſlation from the <hi>Originall,</hi> are to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
for <hi>various Readings;</hi> for it is frequently
acknowledged that ſome variation may be by
the miſtake of the <hi>Tranſlator,</hi> or from Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſticall
<hi>Expoſitions,</hi> where the ſence and not
the words are preciſely expreſſed, where ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
it may be is added to cleer the ſence, and
ſome words left out, as not ſo neceſſary for the
ſence, and ſome errors may be from the <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers</hi>
of the <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> Proleg. 6. Sect. 11.
and <hi>Proleg. 7. 23. Proleg. 9. Sect.</hi> 12. 46. &amp;c.
But when no other <hi>probable cauſe</hi> can be given
of the difference, ſave the <hi>variation</hi> of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie,</hi>
and a <hi>plain reaſon</hi> may be given, why the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115995:52"/>
                  <hi>Tranſlator</hi> ſo rendred it, as becauſe of the <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity</hi>
of words <hi>unpointed,</hi> or the <hi>Change</hi> of
letters alike in <hi>figure</hi> or <hi>ſound,</hi> or <hi>tranſpoſition</hi> of
letters, and the like, in theſe caſes, I ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
why we may not conclude, that the <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator</hi>
read in his Copy, as he hath rendred,
and thence collect a <hi>various Reading</hi> from a
<hi>Tranſlation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IX. We do not ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That theſe <hi>Readings</hi> are
of <hi>equall</hi> authority with thoſe that are gathered
out of <hi>Originall</hi> Copies; nay, it is expreſſed,
<hi>Proleg. 6. Sect.</hi> 8. that they do not, <hi>Pari cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinis
graàu incedere,</hi> and therefore it muſt
needs follow, that the <hi>preſent reading</hi> of the
<hi>Originall</hi> ought not to be altered upon the bare
reading of a <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> but that other pregnant
reaſons and arguments muſt concurre, as we
ſaid before.</p>
               <p>X. To theſe alſo we adde, That theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
readings out of <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> are of the
ſame nature with thoſe gathered out of <hi>Original</hi>
Copies, that is, they are onely in leſſer matters,
not in things of any moment or concernment,
they are ſuch, whereby our faith and ſalvation
are no way indangered, ſuch as the <hi>Keri</hi> and
<hi>Ketib,</hi> &amp;c. Nor do we any where own that rule
of <hi>Capellus,</hi> That that reading, though by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
onely, <hi>ubi ſenſus melior fluit,</hi> where the
ſence and coherence ſeems to be better, is always
to be choſen, for many times we may conceive a
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115995:53"/>
ſence, which would better agree with the words,
in our apprehenſion, which yet the words of the
Text will not bear, and the ſence which the
preſent reading hath may be maintained, and
is followed by more, and better, and ancienter
Copies, and therefore I admit that rule no
otherwiſe, then Reverend <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> Epiſt. ad <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellus,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>XI. Theſe things premiſed, I ſay, that <hi>vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Readings,</hi> many be gathered out of <hi>Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
which may conduce to the true ſence and
reading, and may be taken into conſideration
when queſtion ſhall ariſe about the reading of
ſome place in the <hi>Original Texts.</hi> This is proved
at large, <hi>Proleg. 6. Sect.</hi> 9, 10. both by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of the beſt <hi>Divines,</hi> and men of greateſt
skill in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and greateſt <hi>Patrons</hi> of the
<hi>integrity</hi> of the <hi>Hebrew Text,</hi> and by apparent
reaſon, of all which, our Adverſary takes no
notice, but prudently paſſes over in ſilence (as
in other places) what he could not anſwer. It
is ſhewed out of <hi>Hierom, Beza, Caſaubone, Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,
Schindler, De Dieu, Bochartus, Hottinger,
Salmaſius,</hi> beſides <hi>Bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Muſculus, Mercer,</hi> &amp;c. how common it is
among <hi>Commentators</hi> &amp; others, to gather ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
out of <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> how they read in
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115995:53"/>
their <hi>Copies</hi> differing from the <hi>preſent reading.</hi>
Nor do I remember any Author of note that
generally denied the ſame, before the late quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
of <hi>Bootius</hi> &amp; <hi>Buxtorf</hi> againſt <hi>Capellus,</hi> who
yet, whileſt they grant conjectural <hi>various Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
out of <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> (ſee <hi>Bootius</hi> his <hi>Vind. c.
22.</hi> p. 225.) do in effect ſay as much as their
Adverſary: onely our Author, without any
diſtinction or limitation, abſolutely denies all,
of what kinde or degree ſoever they be, which
for my part, I know not any before him to
have done. Nay, he tells us, <hi>p. 333. That it is
impoſſible to know how any Tranſlator read in his
Copy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he differs from the common reading.</hi>
He might have done well to have given anſwer
to thoſe many inſtances and reaſons to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
mentioned, <hi>Prolegom.</hi> 6. and to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of thoſe great <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>Linguiſts,</hi>
whom he paſſeth by, as not worthy his notice.
Were all theſe, and many others, no better then
<hi>Learned Mountabanks,</hi> as he is pleaſed to call
all of this Opinion, <hi>p.</hi> 315. Surely ſome of
them at leaſt might have deſerved better lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
from him.</p>

exclude the LXX. (how juſtly we have ſhewed,</hi>

various Readings <hi>may be gathered.</hi>

Now, let me appeal to any unbyaſſed man, yea,
to our Adverſary himſelf, whether in theſe
places they do not think in their conſciences,
that the LXX. and the other <hi>Tranſlators</hi> read
in their <hi>Copies</hi> as we have ſhewed, and if they
did, whether it be not evident, that in ſome
caſes, <hi>various Readings</hi> may be gathered out of

               </p>
               <p>XIV. What he further writes in his way of
<hi>declaiming,</hi> I ſhall not need to trouble my ſelf
about, ſeeing nothing is by him brought that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:115995:56"/>
infringes our aſſertion in the leaſt, the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
being rightly ſtated. Onely one thing I
cannot paſſe by, wherein I cannot but admire
his <hi>extreme confidence</hi> in urging a thing ſo palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
untrue, and ſo oft by himſelf contradicted:
p. 317. <hi>Let them prove</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that there was
ever in the world any other Copy of the Bible
differing in any one word, from thoſe that we now
enjoy; Let them produce one teſtimony, one Author
of credit or reputation, that can or doth, or ever
did ſpeak one word to this purpoſe, let them direct us
to any relick, nay monument, any kind of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of them, and not put us off with weak conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
upon the ſignification of one or two words,
and it ſhall be of weight with us:</hi> p. 319. <hi>The care
of God over his truth, and the fidelity of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Church will not permit us to entertain the leaſt
ſuspition that ever there was in the world any
Copy of the Bible, differing in the leaſt from thoſe
we enjoy—The Authors of this inſinuation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
produce the least teſtimony to make it good.</hi>
This is a ſtrange aſſertion, ſuch as I think
never any man maintained before, not any
Copy that ever was, to differ in one word,
nay not in the leaſt, (which extends to ſyllables,
letters and points) That no Teſtimony, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
no Author of credit, no monument of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
not the leaſt teſtimony can be brought
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Do not all the <hi>various Readings</hi> both of
the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament</hi> proclaim the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:115995:56"/>
untruth of this? and doth not himſelf
frequently confeſſe, that there are varieties
amongſt Copies? p. 173. <hi>That in ſome Copies, and
thoſe of good antiquity, there are divers Readings,</hi>
p. 190. <hi>That the Keri and Ketib are various Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,</hi>
p. 296. <hi>That the Tranſcribers have had
failings, and that various Readings have thence
riſen.</hi> p. 165. ſo p. 191. 347. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What thinks he of
thoſe places in the <hi>New Teſtament?</hi> eſpecially
that in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 8. where a verſe is left out in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ancient Copies, and appears ſo to have been
by the Fathers that wrote againſt <hi>Arrius.</hi> Is
there no Author of credit, no monument of
antiquity, that teſtifies that ſome ancient Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
wanted theſe words, which yet all our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Copies have? are not the whole collections
of <hi>diverſe Readings</hi> in <hi>Eraſmus, Stephanus, Beza,
Camerarius,</hi> and others, a reall confutation of
this? He hath looked through the <hi>Prolego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi>

he ſo much oppoſes; he quotes <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. and

In the ſame <hi>Section</hi> is added, that <hi>Junius</hi> beſides

Copies in <hi>Hieromes</hi> time. Much more might be
brought out of <hi>Hierome</hi> and others to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
Theſe places, except onely the laſt, our
Adverſary had read in the <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> and
yet affirms, there never was any Copie in the
world differed in the leaſt from our preſent
Copies, and that no teſtimony nor Author of
credit, nor any relick of antiquity could be
brought to the contrary. Was he in a dream, or
were his wits a wool gathering when he wrote
this? or, having read theſe things in the <hi>Prolego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi>
to which no anſwer could be given, did
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115995:58"/>
he write the contrary to delude the ignorant
Reader? I do not know how to excuſe him. He
tells us elſewhere, <hi>Ep. p.</hi> 17. we muſt grant
(concerning <hi>various Readings</hi> in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
what <hi>ocular inspection</hi> evinces to be
true, but now it ſeems we muſt be hoodwinked,
and not believe what we ſee with our eyes; and
though nothing be more clear, then that there
were of old, and ſtill are differences in the
Hebrew and Greek Copies, yet we muſt believe
there never was any Copy different from our
preſent Copies, not in the leaſt.</p>
               <p>XVI. We have done with this which was
the main Charge. The next is about the <hi>Keri</hi>
and <hi>Ketib,</hi> that is certain <hi>marginall notes</hi> in
the <hi>Hebrew Bibles,</hi> where the <hi>Keri</hi> is the word
that muſt be read, placed in the <hi>Margent,</hi> with
a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> The <hi>Ketib,</hi> or word written in the <hi>Text,</hi>
marked with a little circle or cipher, to which
the points belonging to the <hi>Marginall</hi> word
are put, to intimate, that this word, though
written in the <hi>Text,</hi> ought not to be read, but
that in the <hi>Margent;</hi> concerning which I have
ſpoken at large, <hi>Proleg. 8. Sect. 18, 19. &amp;c. ad
27.</hi> where is ſhewed what they are, <hi>Sect.</hi> 18.
To what heads they may be reduced, <hi>Sect. 9,
20.</hi> That the number is not the ſame, but much
differing, by two or three hundred in the chief
Editions of the <hi>Bible,</hi> Sect. 21. That the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of them were not the Sacred Pen-men,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:115995:58"/>
nor <hi>Eſdras</hi> and his fellows, <hi>Sect.</hi> 22. 23. That
the moſt of them were collected by the <hi>poſt
Talmudicall Rabbins,</hi> out of ſeverall ancient
Copies; and that they left the common reading
in the Text, and put the other which they
judged the better, in the <hi>Margent;</hi> and that
ſome of them were gathered before the <hi>Talmud,
Sect.</hi> 24. That they were not <hi>Criticall Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures</hi>
of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> but <hi>various Readings,</hi>
and ſome few of another nature, <hi>Sect.</hi> 25. After
which are added ſome Obſervations about
them, <hi>Sect.</hi> 26. I ſhall not go over the ſame
things again, but refer the Reader to the <hi>Prole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomena.</hi>
Nor do I know to what purpoſe our
Author goes over them here, I ſhall onely
touch upon what is untruly by him charged on
the <hi>Prolegomena.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XVII. <hi>Page</hi> 206. He reckons this among the
<hi>Paradoxes</hi> in the <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> That the <hi>Keri</hi>
and <hi>Ketib</hi> are <hi>criticall</hi> notes, conſiſting partly
of the <hi>various Readings</hi> of the <hi>Maſorites,</hi> and
late <hi>Rabbins:</hi> and <hi>p.</hi> 157. he ſets it down thus,
That the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of which ſort are above
800 in the <hi>Hebrew Bibles,</hi> are various lections,
partly gathered by ſome <hi>Judaicall Rabbins</hi> out
of ancient Copies, partly their <hi>Criticall amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi>
for which he cites in the <hi>Margent, Proleg.
8. Sect. 23 &amp;c. Anſ.</hi> In both there is nothing tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
related, but untruth and nonſence jumbled
together: for firſt he ſaith, <hi>They are Critical
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115995:59"/>
notes, conſiſting partly of various lections,</hi> which
is a kind of contradiction: for if they be
<hi>Critical notes</hi> they cannot be either in part or in
whole <hi>various lections: Criticall</hi> notes are ſuch
wherein men give their own judgement upon
ſome Reading, whether it be true or falſe, or
which Reading they like beſt; <hi>various Readings</hi>
are the differences of Copies collected and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to the Readers judgement. In the other
place he makes them all to be <hi>various Readings,</hi>
but partly collected by ſome <hi>Rabbins</hi> out of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Copies, and partly their <hi>Criticall amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
that is, ſome of them are gathered out of
Copies others are gathered without authority
of Copies, grounded only upon their Critical fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
in conjecturing. This may be his meaning,
or elſe I cannot make any good ſence of his
words. Howſoever he explain himſelf, the charge
is no leſs void of truth then of ſence, as the place
by him cited will plainly ſhew to any that ſhall
look into it, (for ſtill he never quotes the words)
where it will appear that there is not one word
of <hi>Criticall Conjectures,</hi> or that any part of the
<hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Ketib</hi> are ſuch <hi>conjectures:</hi> nor is there
any mention at all of <hi>conjectures,</hi> ſave that the
Author ſhews his diſlike of them.</p>
               <p>XVIII. That which is affirmed of them in
theſe Sections is, 1. That <hi>Eſdras</hi> and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
were not the Authors of theſe notes, but
that they were gathered long after his time,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:115995:59"/>
partly before and partly after the <hi>Talmund.</hi> That
they could not come from <hi>Eſdras</hi> or the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>
of his times, becauſe theſe <hi>various Readings</hi>
(for ſo they are generally acknowledged, as by
moſt Divines, ſo by our Adverſary himſelf) are
found in the Writings of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Prophets,</hi> as well as in the reſt: and it were
very abſurd to think that they gathered <hi>various
Readings</hi> out of ſeverall Copies of the books
they had written, and to place one Reading in
the Margent, and the other in the Text, as if
they knew not which were the true Reading of
their own Books: and that any of the reſt ſhould
be gathered either by them or any other of the
holy Pen-men is no leſſe abſurd, both for the
ſame reaſon, as alſo becauſe they would have
reſtored the true Reading (if they had found
any difference in Copies) which they being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
guided might have done, and not have
left it doubtfull which Reading was to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
or what was the true ſence of the <hi>Holy
Ghoſt,</hi> by noting both the Readings, and ſo lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all in ſuſpence. This is altogether unbefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the holy Pen-men of Scripture: and our
Adverſary, though he be loth to yield to the
truth, yet confeſſes he is not able to ſatisfie
himſelf in the <hi>Originall</hi> and ſpring of this <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety.</hi>
2. It is proved <hi>Sect.</hi> 24. That ſome of
theſe were obſerved by the <hi>Talmudical Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,</hi>
being mentioned in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> as thoſe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:115995:60"/>
                  <hi>de vocibus ſcriptis &amp; non lectis, &amp; de lectis
&amp; non ſcriptis,</hi> and thoſe which they call <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi>
for which theſe <hi>chaſt Rabbins,</hi> who would
be wiſer then God, and more pure then the
Holy Ghoſt, pur others which they judged
more modeſt in the <hi>Margent</hi> to be read in the
Synagogues, according to that in the <hi>Talmud,
Megil. c. 3. Omnes voces quae in Lege ſunt obſcoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae,
eas legant honeſte.</hi> That all the reſt (of
which there is not a word in the <hi>Talmud)</hi> were
collected by the <hi>Maſorites</hi> after the <hi>Talmud.</hi>
3. That queſtion is handled, whether ſuppoſing
the <hi>Maſorites</hi> to be the Authors, they gathered
them out of various Copies, or made them out
of their own judgements, and <hi>Criticall conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures:</hi>
where it is concluded, that excepting
thoſe which they counted <hi>obſcence,</hi> of which
number are ten, which could not proceed from
the difference of Copies, but from the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and ſuperſtition of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (which have a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
conſideration) that all the reſt came
from variety of Copies, where they noted the
one reading in the Margent, not daring to
change the reading of the Text out of reverence
to the antiquity of their Copies, but left it as it
was, onely they joyned the points of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall</hi>
word, to that in the <hi>Text,</hi> to ſhew that
the word of the <hi>Margent</hi> was to be read, which
they judged the better reading.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:115995:60"/>
XIX. This is the common opinion and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of men learned in theſe matters, ſuch as
<hi>Mercer, Druſius, Bertram, Erpenius, Pagett,
Piſcator, Sixtin Amama,</hi> &amp;c. and of <hi>Buxtorf</hi>
himſelf. And after all, are related the arguments
of <hi>Capellus,</hi> who labours to prove, that the
<hi>Maſorites</hi> gathered them not out of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<hi>Copies,</hi> but by their own <hi>Criticall conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures;</hi>
whoſe opinion is diſliked, and his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
anſwered. By all this it appears moſt
cleerly, that our Adverſary abuſes both his
Reader and the Author of the <hi>Prolegomena,</hi>
with <hi>palpable untruths,</hi> aſcribing that to the
Author of the <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> which he is ſo far
from holding, that he maintains the clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
For he proves, that the <hi>Keri</hi> and
<hi>Ketib</hi> are not <hi>Criticall amendments</hi> of the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,</hi>
but <hi>various Readings</hi> of ancient <hi>Copies,</hi>
(except thoſe before excepted) which he is ſo
far from making <hi>Criticall amendments</hi> of the
<hi>Texts,</hi> that he taxes the <hi>Rabbins</hi> for their bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and ſuperſtition therein:) yea, the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
himſelf, though he thus writes, yet in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
terms elſewhere, (forgetting what he
had formerly ſaid) acquits the Author of the
<hi>Prolegomena</hi> from this calumny, <hi>p. 305. That
they are all or moſt of them,</hi> (Keri <hi>and</hi> Ketib) <hi>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
amendments of the Rabbins is not allowed,
(in the</hi> Prolegomena) <hi>for which latter part of
his determination we thank the Learned Author.</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:115995:61"/>
And <hi>p. 307. In the mean time, I cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
that</hi> Capellus <hi>his fancie, then which I
know nothing more prejudiciall to the truth of
God, is not allowed.</hi> Thus we ſee, we are ſtill
accuſed and acquitted by the ſame pen, as I
have already ſaid.</p>
               <p>XX. After theſe, he tells us, that the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
brought againſt the <hi>divine originall</hi> of
the notes are capable of an eaſie ſolution, which
he is not at leaſure as yet to ſhew, although
he had told us before that he could not ſatisfie
himſelf about the <hi>Originall</hi> of this variety. In
the mean time, let him enjoy his own opinion,
and let me enjoy mine: and if he can bring bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
proofs for the <hi>divine originall</hi> then I have
brought againſt it, I ſhall acknowledge my
error; if not, I expect he will retract his, and
ſome other things he hath about the <hi>Keri</hi> and
<hi>Ketib,</hi> which I ſhall have occaſion to anſwer
in another place, and therefore paſſe them
by here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XXI. Before I conclude this</hi> Chapter, <hi>ſome
thing muſt be added concerning the Notes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
out of</hi> Grotius, <hi>which the Adverſary
ſaith,</hi> are brought as an inſtance of collecting va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Readings upon conjectures, <hi>or rather of</hi>
corrections of the Originall, when any groſſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
have befallen them, <hi>p. 159. 206. 315.
Now, though I might well paſſe over what is
here charged, it being no where acknowledged
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115995:61"/>
in the</hi> Prolegomena, <hi>That the</hi> Originall Texts
<hi>are corrupted, but the contrary maintained; nor
that upon</hi> meer conjectures various Readings <hi>are
to be gathered, (as we have already ſhewed)
and therefore, that theſe Notes out of</hi> Grotius
<hi>could not poſſibly be brought for any ſuch end:
yet, becauſe it is the opinion of ſome Learned
men, that theſe collections out of</hi> Grotius <hi>are
one main cauſe of all this ſtir againſt the</hi> Biblia
Polyglotta, <hi>I ſhall briefly conſider what he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
upon this account. This we finde chiefly,
p. 313. and 348. In the firſt place he ſaith,</hi> That
to make this evident by inſtances, we have a great
number of ſuch various lections gathered by
<hi>Grotius</hi> in the <hi>Appendix.</hi> He wondered at firſt
view, how the Volume ſhould come under that
name. The greateſt part give no various lections
of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, as is pretended, but various
interpretations of others from the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> But
the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> ſalves this ſeeming difficulty.
They are not various lections collected out of any
Copies extant, or ever known to have been extant,
but criticall conjectures of his own, for the
amendment of the Text, or at moſt conjectures
upon the readings of the words by Tranſlators,
eſpecially the <hi>LXX.</hi> and Vulgar Latine. <hi>In the
other place, he ſaith,</hi> he ſhall not much concern
himſelf therein, they are nothing leſſe then va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Readings of that learned mans own obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſetting aſide, firſt the various lectious of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115995:62"/>
the LXX. the Vulgar <hi>Latine, Symmachus,</hi> and
<hi>Theodotion,</hi> wherein we are not concerned. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
the <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Ketib,</hi> which we have often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
over and over in this Volume: Thirdly, the
various Readings of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Occidentall
Jews,</hi> which we have alſo elſewhere: Fourthly,
conjectures how the LXX. or Vulgar <hi>Latine</hi> read
by altring of letters only: Fifthly, conjectures of
his own how the Text may be mended, and a very
little room will take up what remains. By the
curſory view he hath taken of them, he ſees not
one word that can pretend to be a various lecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
unleſſe it belong to the <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Ketib,</hi> or the
difference between the <hi>Orientall</hi> and <hi>Occiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXII. Anſwer, I am not ignorant with
what an envious eye that <hi>incomparably learned</hi>
man, the miracle of our times, is looked upon
by all our Novelliſts; and that his earneſt ſtudy
of the peace of the Church, and endeavour to
cloſe up, rather then to make wider the breaches
and wounds of Chriſtendom, hath expoſed him
to the malice and fury of the turbulent and fiery
ſpirits of all ſides. I ſhall not need to Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gize
for him; what <hi>heighth</hi> of Learning, and
<hi>dephth</hi> of judgement dwelt in him, his Works
proclaim to all learned and moderate men, and
will ſpeak to all Poſterity; others have with
more able Pens vindicated him from thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquies
and aſperſions, which unreaſonable men
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:115995:62"/>
have caſt upon him. A man he was of that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
in all kindes of learning, <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi>
of that <hi>exact judgment, prudence, piety,</hi> and
<hi>moderation,</hi> that I believe he hath left few equals
in the Chriſtian world: In his younger years
he was by <hi>Scaliger</hi> himſelf (whoſe over-weening
conceit of his own great abilities would hardly
permit him to ſpeak well of any) ſtiled <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
in his Epiſtles: I could not therefore but
think that an extract out of his learned <hi>Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi>
might be fit amongſt others to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
into this Work, and the rather, becauſe he
was one that did not <hi>extrema ſectari,</hi> but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
inclining to any party or faction, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to himſelf the ſearch of the naked truth for
it ſelf, and therefore I might hope that this pains
would be thankfully received by learned, wiſe,
and moderate men, wherein I know I have not
failed of my ends; as for thoſe violent and heady
ſpirits, <hi>Turba gravis paci,</hi> &amp;c. I know it is in vain
to think of ſatisfying them, or to hope that any
thing will reliſh with them, ſave what is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itted to
their own diſtempered palate: for as <hi>Eſpenc.</hi> in
Tit. 1. <hi>`Quibus os putet, omnia putida ſunt, non
alimenti, ſed oris vitio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXIII. I ſhall not need therefore to <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logize,</hi>
either for him or for my ſelf, in publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Extract, but ſhall obſerve, that our
Author will proceed in his uſuall way of calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
For firſt, He cannot make it appear by any
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:115995:63"/>
one word in the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> or <hi>Appendix,</hi> that
this was the end of publiſhing his Notes, as an
inſtance of gathering <hi>various Readings</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures,
when the <hi>Text</hi> is corrupt, but meerly
becauſe of his <hi>great</hi> and <hi>generall learning,</hi> which
might make them acceptable to learned and
moderate men; for which cauſe, I conceived,
they might juſtly deſerve a place amongſt the
<hi>collections</hi> of other learned men of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which are here exhibited. Nor ſecondly,
do theſe Notes conſiſt only or chiefly upon ſuch
conjectures, there are ſcarce one or two in the
whole <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> nor doth he go meerly upon
conjectures, but uſually upon ſome ancient
Tranſlations, or Teſtimony of ancient Writers,
and reaſons drawn from the circumſtances of the
<hi>Text:</hi> and ſo for other books of the <hi>Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
the moſt of them are <hi>criticall notes</hi> about
the ſeverall <hi>Tranſlations</hi> of others, and about the
<hi>literall ſence</hi> and <hi>reading</hi> of the <hi>Text,</hi> ſcarce one
or two of the <hi>Keri's</hi> are mentioned in three or
four books, as we ſhall ſhew anon; and therefore
not <hi>ſerved over and over;</hi> yea, our Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<hi>p.</hi> 348. contradicting what he ſaid, <hi>p.</hi> 313.
and elſewhere, after his uſuall manner, ſaith,
<hi>they are nothing leſſe then various Readings of
that learned mans own obſervation,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not ſuch <hi>conjecturall various Readings,</hi> as
he ſaith, are brought for inſtances in the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix.</hi>
Thirdly, that thoſe out of the <hi>New
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115995:63"/>
Teſtament,</hi> which are the far greater part of
that Extract, are <hi>various Readings</hi> out of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
<hi>Copies,</hi> (not bare conjectures) with his
judgement upon them, and the reaſons for it;
and therefore our Author may ceaſe wondering
how theſe few ſheets, (which are nothing leſſe
then a Volume, as he calls them) ſhould come
under the name of <hi>various Readings,</hi> ſeeing the
greateſt part? which may give <hi>denomination</hi> to
the whole, conſiſts of <hi>various Readings</hi> of the
<hi>New Teſtament:</hi> and though there be other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
amongſt them of great uſe and worth,
yet the greater part conſiſting of <hi>divers read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
might well give the name to the whole:
Beſides, it is not ſaid in the <hi>Title,</hi> that they be all
<hi>various Readings</hi> of the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> but <hi>various
Readings</hi> in generall; and though there be few
of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> yet there
are others of the <hi>Greek, Sept. Symmachus, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotion,</hi>
and <hi>Aquila,</hi> the <hi>Vulgar Latine,</hi> and
other <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> beſides thoſe of the <hi>New
Teſtament;</hi> and therefore the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> needs
no ſuch way as is by him ſurmized, to ſalve a
difficulty which is not. Fourthly, the <hi>Publiſher</hi>
did never take upon him to defend whatſoever
is ſaid by any in their Notes which are added to
the <hi>Bible;</hi> he is not bound to maintain all that
<hi>Nobilius, Lucas Brugenſis,</hi> Mr. <hi>Young,</hi> or any
others have ſaid in any of their obſervations,
but thinks it enough that in generall they are of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115995:64"/>
great uſe, and acceptable to learned men, who
know how to make uſe of them; &amp; that to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the deſires of ſuch, he had juſt cauſe to annex
them to this <hi>Edition:</hi> but if any man ſhall meet
with ſome things, which he cannot reliſh, let
him not reject the <hi>Gold,</hi> becauſe of ſome <hi>droſſe,</hi>
or reject the <hi>Wheat,</hi> though there be ſome <hi>chaff.</hi>
The <hi>Publiſher</hi> profeſſes, there are ſome things
which he cannot wholly ſubſcribe to, yet he is
far from rejecting the whole, or thinking it
therefore not fit to be publiſhed, he propoſes
them to all, let every man judge as he thinks
fit, and abound in his own ſence, whether they
approve, or reject, more or fewer, it ſhall be
no offence to him.</p>

things which he findes fault with, in
thoſe</hi> particular Readings <hi>here exhibited in the
laſt Volume, which we muſt conſider, before we
paſſe from this head of</hi> various Readings. <hi>He is

of nothing but <hi>various Readings</hi> of the

conſiſts of above two hundred ſheets, of which
there are not above two ſheets of the <hi>Hebrew
various Readings,</hi> viz. only the <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Ketib,</hi>
with thoſe of <hi>Ben-Aſcher,</hi> and <hi>Ben Naphtali,</hi>

are more perfectly enumerated then in any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Edition, being gathered out of divers chief
Editions of the <hi>Bible</hi> compared together,
amongſt which there is a difference of two or
three hundred in ſome Editions, which confutes
the Opinion of <hi>Ar. Mont.</hi> and ſome others,
(of whom our Author ſeems to be one) that
would have the <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Ketib</hi> to be the ſame

written above three hundred years ago another
more ancient, belonging to <hi>Cajus</hi> Colledge in
<hi>Cambridge,</hi> part of which was collated; of which
becauſe it ſeemed to be negligently written, and
for other reaſons, I did not think fit to mention
the differences. So here we ſee how far from
truth this Charge is concerning the <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. And as far is it from <hi>truth</hi> concerning
the <hi>Greek Text</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament:</hi> for (as
any may ſee) here was not one Printed <hi>Copy</hi>
collated (though there be many differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:115995:67"/>
the <hi>Editions</hi> of <hi>Eraſmus, Beza,</hi> the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plutenſe,</hi>
&amp;c. and others, as all know who have
collated any) and divers <hi>MS.</hi> Copies we had
which were not collated at all, but choſe out
thoſe that are exhibited, leaving out the reſt.
Thoſe <hi>various Readings</hi> obſerved out of the
<hi>Complutenſe,</hi> are indeed, moſt of them, noted
among the reſt, but not by comparing any prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Copie, but as they are in <hi>Stephens various
Readings,</hi> gathered out of his ſixteen <hi>Copies:</hi>
ſo that we ſee how far our Author hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
for the number.</p>
               <p>V. But ſuppoſe that more Copies <hi>MS.</hi> and
<hi>Printed</hi> had been collated and exhibited, was it
ever accounted a crime before now? If to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
and compare <hi>ancient Copies</hi> hath been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
always accounted <hi>good ſervice,</hi> for <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving</hi>
the <hi>Originall Text,</hi> or confirming and
reſtoring the <hi>true reading,</hi> is their diligence to
be condemned that have done more then others
before them in that kinde? If it were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
in ſome, it cannot juſtly be blamed
in others. Thoſe that have heretofore laboured
about any ſpeciall Editions of the <hi>Old</hi> or <hi>New
Teſtaments,</hi> uſed to conſult with all the <hi>ancient
Copies</hi> they could get, or others of <hi>good note.</hi>
Thus did <hi>Origen</hi> in his <hi>Hexapla;</hi> thus did S. <hi>Hier.</hi>
as appears frequently in his Works; ſo did the
<hi>Complutenſe Divines, Montanus, Eraſmus,
Beza, Nobilius, Heintenius, Lucas Brugenſis,</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:115995:67"/>
the <hi>Lovain Divines</hi> and others; thus among the
<hi>Jews</hi> did <hi>Ben-Aſcher, Ben-Naphtali, R. Hillel.
R. Ben-Chajim, R. Menachem, Ben-Louzano,
R. Manaſſeh Ben-Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. they compared
divers <hi>Copies,</hi> noted the differences, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
gave their judgement, pitching upon that
<hi>Reading</hi> which they judged to be beſt; where is
our crime, who do the ſame now? nay not ſo
much, ſeeing we do not preſume to alter any
thing in the received or common reading, but
only propound what we finde, and leave it to
others to judge as they ſhall ſee cauſe.</p>
               <p>VI. Our Author commends <hi>Eraſmus, Beza,
Camerarius, Stephanus,</hi> and others, for the ſame
thing for which we are reproved; It ſeems, if
this had been done by others, all had been well.
<hi>Rob. Stephanus</hi> in his Edition of the <hi>Vulgar
Latine, anno</hi> 1540. names many old <hi>Copies</hi> he
had collated, whoſe <hi>different Readings</hi> he put in
the <hi>Margent,</hi> and in his accurate <hi>Edition</hi> of the
<hi>New Teſtament,</hi> he reckons ſixteen <hi>Greek Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,</hi>
which he collated, and out of them noted
2384. <hi>various Readings,</hi> which he thought fit to
put in the <hi>Margent</hi> of his <hi>Edition;</hi> nor was he
ever blamed by any, but highly approved by all
for his pains and <hi>diligence. Lucas Brugenſis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> a
man of great learning and judgement, and a

<hi>Heintenius</hi> and the <hi>Lovain</hi> Divines, as appears
by their Notes, uſed all the Copies Printed, and
MSS. which they could get, that they might
help forward a <hi>correct</hi> and <hi>perfect Edition</hi> of the
<hi>Vulgar Latine. Eraſmus</hi> in his Preface to his
excellent <hi>Annotations</hi> on the <hi>New Teſtament</hi>
tells us what Copies he compared, and what
pains he took about the ſeverall Readings, that
no error might paſſe, but the genuine Reading
might be eſtabliſhed. But now it ſeems the caſe
is altered; the more Copies we uſe, the more
labour is ſpent to no purpoſe: We are told that
in gathering theſe <hi>various Readings,</hi> we have
the utmoſt of <hi>Satans malice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the negligence

               <p>VII. But could this <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> ſee nothing
uſefull in the variety of Copies? Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
was of another mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he wrote thus of
the variety of <hi>Tranſlations</hi> in his time. <hi>Tantum

all matters of weight, whether of <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>life,</hi>

not left us without means to judge of the beſt

Beſides, ſeeing no one Copy now extant can
pretend to be a ſtandard in every thing for all
others, and our Adverſary flies to this (as we
ſhewed already) that all the revealed truth is
preſerved entire in ſome Copy or other, and
ſeeing it is impoſſible to conſult all Copies in
the world, therefore to have as many as we can,
and thoſe of greateſt antiquity, and of the beſt
note, to conſult with, is the beſt means that can
be uſed, to judge of the true reading, and to
preſerve it to poſterity. Now in theſe various
Readings we have all the beſt and choiceſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
that could be got; which are tendered to
every mans view, and therefore this collection
muſt needs be of great uſe. Thoſe therefore
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115995:69"/>
that have uſed their utmoſt diligence in this
kind for preſerving the truth, are but ill requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

there are ſome differences in the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
Copies, and yet the <hi>Copies</hi> are not <hi>corrupt.</hi>
When <hi>Buxtorfs Bible</hi> comes out, whereof part
is already Printed, this ſuperſtitious conceit of
the Hebrew Copies not varying in any thing
will clearly vaniſh. In the mean time he may

may find diverſe various Readings collected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides

               </p>
               <p>XIV. What he objects about the ſame <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Readings</hi> ſerved twice over, the <hi>Keri</hi> and
<hi>Ketib</hi> over and over, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſtill ſhews his <hi>Candor
and love of truth.</hi> Could he find no reaſon why
the <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Ketib</hi> were twice enumerated, but
to increaſe the bulk, and preſent the more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
to a leſſe attentive Reader? read them
over and bluſh. They are firſt reckoned up ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>order</hi> of the <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Chapters,</hi>
as they ſtand in the <hi>Bible,</hi> as they are in other
<hi>Editions,</hi> that ſo the Reader might know what
is in each <hi>Book</hi> and <hi>Chapter,</hi> yet here they are
with reference to the ſeverall chief <hi>Editions</hi> of
the <hi>Bible,</hi> which differ much in the number,
which was not done before in any <hi>Edition.</hi> And
is there nothing in the ſecond <hi>Catalogue</hi> but a
bare enumeration of the ſame argument? any
eye not blinded with prejudice might have ſeen
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:115995:73"/>
ſome other benefit ariſing to the <hi>Reader:</hi> For
whereas they are of <hi>divers ſorts and natures,</hi>
they are all reduced to their ſeverall <hi>Heads</hi> and
<hi>Claſſes,</hi> and the number of each ſort examined,
and the places quoted together where they are
diſperſedly mentioned throughout the <hi>Bible,</hi> and
withall, how many, and which of each ſort are
acknowledged by each <hi>Edition,</hi> and withall ſome
<hi>judgment</hi> given of moſt of them. Thus for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample:
There are ſome which are <hi>not written</hi> in
the Text, a voyd ſpace being left, or onely the
<hi>points</hi> without the <hi>letters,</hi> which yet are to be
<hi>read</hi> as in the <hi>Marg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> of which ſort are thirteen
which are there mentioned, and the places men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
where they are to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound: ſome again
are <hi>written</hi> in the Text, but <hi>not read,</hi> which
have no <hi>points</hi> affixed, of which ſort are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ive,
which are there mentioned with the places
where they are to be found. Again, ſome are
written <hi>conjunctim</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi> as if they were
one word, which as the <hi>marginall Keri</hi> notes
muſt be read <hi>diviſim,</hi> as two words, of which
ſort are eleven, or as the little <hi>Maſora</hi> ſaith,
fifteen, which are alſo all ſpecified together:
Some again are written <hi>ſeverally,</hi> as if they
were <hi>divers words,</hi> which are to be read <hi>jointly</hi>
as one word, as the <hi>Keri</hi> notes, of which ſort
are eight. Again, ſome words there are which
to thoſe chaſt <hi>Rabbins</hi> ſeemed <hi>obſcene,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they put others <hi>leſſe offenſive</hi> in the <hi>margent</hi>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:115995:74"/>
to be read in their ſtead in the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> of
which ſort are ten, which are all enumerated,
with ſome about <hi>ſervile,</hi> ſome about <hi>radicall let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
ſome by <hi>addition,</hi> ſome by <hi>detraction,</hi> ſome
by <hi>tranſpoſition,</hi> or <hi>change</hi> of a letter, ſome about
<hi>words,</hi> &amp;c. of all which ſorts, how many, and in
what places they are, is diſtinctly ſet down, and
what difference there is about them in the <hi>chief
Editions,</hi> or in the <hi>Maſora,</hi> or <hi>El. Levita.</hi>
Now, can our cavilling Adverſary finde no uſe
of all this, but onely to increaſe the number?
is there not here much <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> to the <hi>Reader</hi>
to know how many there are of <hi>each rank,</hi> and
where to be found. If he finde no benefit, he
may forbear to look upon it, and leave it to
others that can, let him finde out every differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
by the firſt <hi>Catalogue.</hi> Nor was this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of them the work of <hi>Capellus</hi> alone,
though he hath laboured more then any other
therein. The ſame was done long before by <hi>Elias
Lev.</hi> and in the <hi>Maſora,</hi> in many, by <hi>Schindler,
Sixtin. Amama,</hi> whoſe obſervations about
theſe things were publiſhed long before <hi>Capellus</hi>
his <hi>Critica.</hi> That which is added about <hi>Grotius,</hi>
is as void of truth as the reſt. Are they given
a third time in <hi>Grotius</hi> his Notes, where there
are ſcarce <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> mentioned in the whole
<hi>Pentateuch,</hi> though there are above ſeventy?
So in I. and II. of <hi>Sam.</hi> not above <hi>two</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
among an hundred, and ſo for the reſt.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115995:74"/>
How great a bulk do theſe make, how is the
Volume ſwelled by them? Neither had theſe
few been mentioned out of him, but that he
gives his <hi>judgement</hi> of them. The like may be
anſwered to what he ſaith of thoſe of the <hi>New
Teſtament.</hi> In the firſt collection they are barely
named, with the <hi>Copies</hi> they relate to. In <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
and <hi>Lucas Brugenſis,</hi> their <hi>ſeverall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
are given of ſo many as they took notice
of. Now is it no <hi>benefit</hi> to the <hi>Reader,</hi> to have
the <hi>judgement</hi> of ſuch <hi>Learned Men</hi> upon them,
but all muſt be to increaſe the bulk?</p>
               <p>XV. As he findes fault with the <hi>multitude</hi> of
the <hi>various Readings,</hi> ſo he queſtions the <hi>Copies</hi>
out of which they are gathered, and the <hi>fidelity</hi>
of the <hi>Collectors.</hi> The <hi>Copies, few or none are of
any conſiderable antiquity,</hi> pag 195. <hi>any book
though but of yeſterday,</hi> p. 192. <hi>he doubts whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
theſe Readings be tolerably atteſted to for
various Readings or no,</hi> pag. 191. Beza <hi>hath
ſtigmatized his own Copy ſent to</hi> Cambridge, <hi>to
be ſo corrupt in the Goſpel of Saint</hi> Luke, <hi>that he
durſt not publiſh the</hi> various Readings <hi>of it, for
fear of ſcandall,</hi> p. 195. <hi>Beſides, in that MS.
Copy of</hi> Emanuel Colledge, <hi>which is only of the
Epiſtles, many</hi> various Readings <hi>are quoted, as out
of the</hi> Goſpels <hi>and</hi> Acts, <hi>with</hi> Col. Eman <hi>prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
And it may be ſuppoſed that this miſtake goes
not alone; but upon examination of particulars,
they will be found not ſo cleerly atteſted,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115995:75"/>
doubts not, but upon ſearch, ſome of theſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
will be found no better then that</hi> Hebrew
MS. <hi>of the</hi> Pſalms, <hi>rejected by</hi> Arias Montanus,
<hi>and therefore he earneſtly exhorts ſome of his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
to examine theſe</hi> various Readings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Here we may obſerve how little our <hi>Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
conſidered</hi> what he wrote, but that he vented
<hi>Quicquid in buccam venerat;</hi> for how could he
judge of the Copies and MSS. we uſed, which he
never collated, and may be ſcarce ever ſaw any
of them? I am ſure they are the <hi>choiceſt,</hi> and
ſome of them of the <hi>beſt Antiquitie</hi> in <hi>England,</hi>
yea, ſome the <hi>ancienteſt</hi> that are this day <hi>in the
world.</hi> And I can further aver, that <hi>ſome Copies</hi>
I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aid aſide, which ſeemed to be of <hi>no antiquity,</hi>
or <hi>negligently</hi> written, ſo far were we from
taking up all that could be had, though but of
<hi>yeſterday.</hi> The greateſt part of thoſe of the
<hi>New Teſtament</hi> were, as ſaid before, with great
labour and charge, ſought out, and collated by
the moſt Reverend <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> and out of the beſt
<hi>Libraries,</hi> publike or private in <hi>England;</hi> and
I believe, he was as able to judge of a <hi>Copy</hi>
as another. What thinks our Author of the
<hi>Alexandrian MS.</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> in
<hi>Greek,</hi> preſerved in the <hi>Kings Library,</hi> written
in <hi>Capital Letters,</hi> without <hi>accents,</hi> or <hi>diſtinction</hi>
either of <hi>words</hi> or <hi>ſentences,</hi> one of the <hi>Nobleſt
MSS. in the world?</hi> which kind of writing hath
been out of uſe for above a thouſand years, as
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115995:75"/>
our beſt <hi>Antiquaries</hi> conclude, and therefore
this <hi>MS.</hi> muſt needs exceed that age. What
of the <hi>Codex Claromontanus,</hi> and of that
which <hi>Beza</hi> ſent to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> written in the
ſame manner? Moſt of the reſt are of great
<hi>Antiquity.</hi> Not to inſiſt upon that <hi>Greek MS.</hi> of
the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> brought out of <hi>Greece</hi> by <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi>
who was <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Cant.</hi> above a
thouſand years ago, which is now in <hi>Cambridge
Library;</hi> nor of that ancient remnant of Sir
<hi>Robert Cottons Greek MS.</hi> of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> eſteemed
by <hi>Learned <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> the oldeſt <hi>MS. in the world,</hi>
becauſe theſe concern the <hi>Greek</hi> LXX which is
of no account with our Adverſary. But what
atteſtation deſires he of the Copies? the moſt
of them are in <hi>publike Libraries,</hi> and may atteſt
for themſelves, he may exhort whom he will to
examine the <hi>Copies</hi> and the <hi>various Readings,</hi> if
he can finde them unfaithfully collected, let him
publiſh it to the world, &amp; not ſpare us. But how
this will be done, unleſſe they mean to collate
all over again, I know not, and I doubt it will
be found a labour, which neither he, nor any of
his novices will eaſily undergo.</p>
               <p>XVI. But he inſtances in ſome <hi>Copies.</hi> Bezaes
<hi>is ſtigmatized by himſelf:</hi> but where had he this,

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity,</hi>
which he had not known if I had not publiſhed
it? And if I had intended to deceive the Reader,
I might have ſuppreſſed it, whereas I have plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

declared my judgement on that <hi>Copy</hi> about
the <hi>Genealogie</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>Prolegom. 9. 65. that
in that point it is of no credit:</hi> yet why it might
not be uſefull in other matters I know not; and
conſidering the great antiquity of it, why it
might not deſerve to be collated amongſt other
<hi>Copies. Beza</hi> frequently makes uſe of it in his
Notes, and calls it, <hi>Exemplar ſuum venerandae
antiquitatis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

to agree with our <hi>Old Alexandrian MS.</hi> and
other ancient <hi>Copies,</hi> and with the reading of
divers ancient Writers of the Church, where
our later <hi>Copies</hi> do read otherwiſe, ſo that the
concurrence of it with thoſe ancient <hi>Copies,</hi> may
confirm the reading that is found in them, and
ſo it may be of great uſe. And though <hi>Beza</hi>
ſaith, he found ſo great diſcrepance in it from
other <hi>Copies</hi> in Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> that to avoid the
offence of ſome (weak perſons) he thought fit
rather to preſerve it then to publiſh it, (which
is all the <hi>ſtigmatizing</hi> here boaſted of) yet he

               <p>XVII. As for that <hi>MS.</hi> of St. <hi>Pauls Epiſtles
in Emanuel Colledge,</hi> though there was another
<hi>MS.</hi> in the ſame <hi>Colledge,</hi> of the <hi>Goſpels</hi> and
<hi>Acts,</hi> whoſe name was caſually omitted in the
<hi>Catalogue,</hi> yet he can never prove any <hi>falſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
or indirect dealing. Here is no obtruding
of any <hi>various Readings</hi> out of a <hi>MS.</hi> which is
not. Only the name of that <hi>MS.</hi> of the <hi>Goſpels</hi>
and <hi>Acts</hi> was not noted among the reſt, and
what great matter is this? Is the Reader here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
deceived or abuſed with any <hi>forgerie</hi> or <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth?</hi>
The occaſion of the omiſſion was this,
Thoſe <hi>Readings</hi> of that <hi>MS.</hi> came to hand af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the reſt were finiſhed, and after the <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi>
of the <hi>MSS.</hi> was drawn up, ready for
the Preſſe, whereby the name of this <hi>MS.</hi> was
forgotten to be inſerted among the reſt in the
<hi>Catalogue.</hi> Our Author himſelf confeſſeth that
in a Work of this variety, it were a miracle that
many things ſhould not eſcape the eye of the
moſt diligent obſerver, yet he cannot forbear
to inſinuate, that there hath not been fair deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:115995:77"/>
in this collection, nor to raiſe ſuſpicions, as
if other things of the like nature might be found

great, as his miſtake that ſays, that <hi>Morinus</hi> (now
lately dead) was a <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> a <hi>petulant Jeſuite,</hi>
p. 207. an <hi>aſpiring Jeſuite,</hi> p. 299. when any
that reads the Title Page of any of his books,
may ſee he was of the <hi>Oratorian Order,</hi> which
was founded divers years after that of the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites:</hi>
or, that the Oracles of God were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the <hi>Jews</hi> under the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and
all the Writings of the <hi>New,</hi> as we find, <hi>Ep.</hi> p. 3.
and yet no notice taken of in the <hi>Errata;</hi> or to
write, as <hi>p.</hi> 80 that the <hi>various Readings</hi> of the
<hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Weſtern Jews</hi> appeared firſt in the
Edition of the <hi>Bible</hi> by <hi>Bombergus,</hi> under the

Readings, There is no choice made, no judgement
uſed in diſcerning true from ſpurious, but all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
whatſoever, that could be found in any</hi>
Copies, <hi>printed or written, are equally given out:
That the firſt obſervation in</hi> Lucas Brugenſis,
<hi>printed next to this Collection, rejects one of theſe
varieties as a corruption,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer, 1. That is
altogether untrue: for many differences in theſe
<hi>Copies</hi> were left out, becauſe they appeared
plainly to be errors of the <hi>Tranſcriber;</hi> and this
I can certainly affirm, and therefore all differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of <hi>Copies</hi> are not here noted: Secondly,
yet I deny not but that there may be divers <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining</hi>
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> may come into that number, which
I thought fit rather to leave to the <hi>Readers
judgement,</hi> then to leave out every thing which
ſeemed ſo to me; for that may ſeem to be a
miſtake of the <hi>Scribe</hi> to one, which happily may
be thought none in anothers judgment, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in that which he ſaith is noted by <hi>Lucas
Brugenſis</hi> for a <hi>corruption,</hi> which yet he knows
<hi>Robertus Stephanus</hi> reckoned among <hi>various
Readings;</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> thought ſo well of it, that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115995:78"/>
he preferred it before the <hi>common reading:</hi> nor
doth <hi>Lucas Brugenſis</hi> reject it as a <hi>corruption;</hi>
but taxes <hi>Beza</hi> for preferring this <hi>Reading</hi> upon
the authority of <hi>one Copy</hi> before the <hi>common
Reading;</hi> but it ſeems, if <hi>one Reading</hi> have more
reaſon for it then another, the other muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
be a <hi>corruption</hi> in our Adverſaries <hi>Logick,</hi>
and yet it appears, that there are more <hi>Copies</hi>
then one which atteſt this <hi>Reading;</hi> we have
four more which concur in it, as appears in our
<hi>Collection,</hi> and I doubt it would trouble him to
anſwer <hi>Beza's</hi> reaſons for that <hi>Reading.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it is declared more then once in the <hi>Prole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomena,</hi>
that every difference of a <hi>Copy</hi> is not
properly a <hi>various Reading. Vide Prolegom. 6.
Sect. 8. Scribarum errores de quibus certo conſtat,
inter varias lectiones nequaquam reforendi;</hi> and
therefore, (though the major part give the <hi>deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi>
to the whole, and all differences in a
generall ſence may be called <hi>various Readings)</hi>
if any who have leiſure and abilities, ſhall ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
them, and ſhall plainly prove, that ſome of
them are errors of the <hi>Tranſcriber,</hi> it ſhall be
no offence at all to me, ſo it be not done, <hi>animo
calumniandi,</hi> without <hi>magiſteriall</hi> impoſing
their conceits upon others, and ſo that they
leave to others the like liberty which they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to themſelves. Neither were it incumbent
on us, (as our Author cannot but confeſſe, and
therefore anſwers himſelf) to give our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115995:78"/>
upon every <hi>Reading,</hi> which is the beſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we
had work enough beſides: and therefore thoſe
that have ſo much leiſure to <hi>cavill</hi> and <hi>quarrell</hi>
at every thing, may do well to exerciſe their
<hi>Criticall</hi> faculty herein, only I wiſh they may
have better ſucceſſe then our Author hath in

that they would not be too forward in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
ſuch to be <hi>corruptions,</hi> which it may be,
wiſer and learneder men judge otherwiſe of.
Fourthly, to give the ſeverall <hi>Readings</hi> of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Copies</hi> of note, without paſſing any judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of each, is no new thing. In what <hi>Edition</hi>
of the <hi>Hebrew Bibles,</hi> doth he finde any judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon the <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Ketib</hi> in particular, and
thoſe other <hi>Hebrew varieties?</hi> or where doth he
find any thing to this purpoſe, ſave what is done
by <hi>Capellus</hi> in his <hi>Critica,</hi> or by <hi>Buxtorf,</hi> in his
<hi>Bible</hi> now Printing. <hi>Ar. Mont.</hi> brings divers
<hi>Readings</hi> of the <hi>Greek, Chaldee,</hi> and <hi>Syriack,</hi>

gives any judgement of them. And if here the

as ſeemed good to himſelf, he had not left all to
the <hi>Readers</hi> judgement, but ſubjected all to his

alſo the <hi>chief Copies, MS.</hi> or others, of both,
that ſo in this <hi>Edition</hi> the <hi>Reader</hi> might have
all, or moſt other <hi>Editions,</hi> and the beſt <hi>MSS.</hi>
which he might conſult at pleaſure. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

we ſhall briefly conſider the force of
thoſe <hi>Conſequences,</hi> whether they do juſtly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
from any Principle by us acknowledged in
the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> or <hi>Appendix.</hi> Our Author
ſometimes ſeems not to be reſolved of the truth
of his <hi>Conſequence.</hi> p. 147. he ſaith, <hi>theſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Lections do, at the firſt view, ſeem to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
that the Originals are corrupt.</hi> p. 159.
<hi>They ſeem ſufficient to beget ſcruples,</hi> &amp;c. p. 156.
<hi>Theſe</hi> Prolegomena <hi>ſeem to impair the truth.</hi>
&amp;c. p. 147. <hi>Men of perverſe mindes may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly

<hi>That the Prefacer doth not own thoſe wretched

and if they be <hi>wreſted</hi> by men of <hi>perverſe

follow:</hi> no <hi>genuine Conſequence</hi> can be ſaid
to be <hi>wreſted,</hi> nor will he, I hope, joyn with
men of <hi>perverſe mindes.</hi> And if the Author of
the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> do not own them, then they
ought not to be objected againſt him, without
ſufficient proof of the <hi>Conſequences,</hi> which theſe
<hi>Conſiderations</hi> do no where afford. But in other
places he ſpeaks more poſitively: p. 205. <hi>They
are all directed,</hi> or <hi>by juſt conſequence owned in
the</hi> Prolegomena. p. 206. <hi>That no ſufficient ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
againſt the lawfull deriving of them is
tendered.</hi> p. 161. <hi>That they are an engine fitted

for the deſtruction of that important truth by him
pleaded for, and as a fit weapon put into the hands
of Atheiſticall men, to oppoſe the whole evidence
of truth revealed in the Scripture,</hi> &amp;c. p. 207.
<hi>Great and wiſe men,</hi> (of which himſelf is one
without doubt) <hi>do ſuppoſe them naturally, and
neceſſarily to flow from them.</hi> And therefore,
p. 147. he <hi>abſolutely</hi> affirms, <hi>They are in brief,
the foundation of Mahumetaniſme, the chiefeſt
and principall prop of Popery, the onely pretence
of Fanatick Antiſcripturiſts, and the root of

in this kinde, to prove that they do follow from

againſt the</hi> certainty, integrity, <hi>and</hi> ſupreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Scripture, <hi>from any thing affirmed
in the</hi> Prolegomena, <hi>may appear, becauſe, as is
at large ſhewed,</hi> The <hi>Prolegomena</hi> do not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the Originall Texts to be corrupt, but to be
pure and authentick, of ſupreme authority, the
rule of faith and life, and of all Tranſlations.
The various Readings of the Originall Texts do
not infer the corrupting of the Text, but may
well ſtand with the purity and authority thereof.
That our Author affirms the ſame with the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legomena,</hi>
about various Readings, which he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
confeſſeth to be both in the Old Teſtament
and the New. And as for thoſe various Readings
out of Tranſlations which he would not allow, they
are of the ſame nature with thoſe which he allows
out of the original copies: for the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> ſay
they are in matters of no moment, contain nothing
repugnant to the Analogie of ſaith, and ſuch are
by himſelf allowed in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek.</hi>

<hi>Here we ſee the ſame Arguments which
our Adverſary brings about the uncertainty of
Scripture propounded, and the ſame anſwer gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
which we have given already. They ſhew
the inconſequence of his</hi> Argument, <hi>and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the great</hi> uſefulneſſe <hi>of gathering</hi>
various Readings, <hi>and further (which is to be
obſerved) they do not onely allow of</hi> various
Readings <hi>out of the</hi> Originall Texts, <hi>but alſo
out of</hi> Tranſlations, <hi>which they often practiſe
themſelves, and ſometimes prefer before the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115995:83"/>
common Reading, as we have ſhewed</hi> Proleg. 6.

               <p>VI. I will mention one more, <hi>Eraſmus,</hi>
whom our Author names as the firſt and chiefeſt
that laboured in this kind, <hi>p.</hi> 189. and <hi>Epiſt. p.
21.</hi> whoſe pains likewiſe he tells us were <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniated</hi>
by ſome in his time. He wrote indeed
a whole Volume of <hi>Apologies</hi> for his ſeverall
Works, and in this particular he was railed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
moſt by <hi>ignorant Friers,</hi> who uſed the ſame
words, which are now taken up by this Author
againſt us, for the ſame thing. He compared
<hi>divers Copies</hi> of the <hi>new Teſtament,</hi> to make his
<hi>Edition</hi> the more perfect, and ſeverall Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and expoſitions of the Ancients, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

VII. If our Adverſaries rule had been recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that no errors can befall the Text, either
by <hi>malice,</hi> or <hi>negligence,</hi> there had never been
any <hi>correct Edition</hi> made by any: and if it had
been thought <hi>unlawfull,</hi> in any caſe to queſtion
the <hi>common Reading,</hi> men might have ſpared
their labour, who from time to time, by <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
Copies</hi> and other helps above mentioned,
have endevoured to make <hi>Exact Editions,</hi> both
of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> which we ſee yet was
at ſeverall times practiſed both by Jews and
Chriſtians; <hi>Ben Aſcher, Ben Naphtali, R. Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel,
Ben Chajim, Manaſſ. Ben Iſrael, Buxtorf,
Arias Montanus, Eraſmus, Steven, Beza,</hi>
and others, who altered and amended what
they found by <hi>miſtake</hi> had crept into the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
or vulgar Copies;</hi> and whoſe labours, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by <hi>explicite</hi> or <hi>tacite</hi> conſent of the
<hi>Church,</hi> receiving them without gainſaying,
have been <hi>approved and commended:</hi> whereas if
nothing muſt be amended, as nothing muſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Adverſaries ſuppoſall, all errors that
ſhall happen are uncapable of cure, becauſe we
muſt ſuppoſe there can be none, and ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that errors will now and then happen
(notwithſtanding all poſſible diligence) as all
men, even himſelf, do grant, a plain way is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the utter <hi>corruption</hi> and <hi>deprivation</hi> of the
whole Scripture, &amp; ſo the caſe will be the ſame
with the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> or the <hi>Pope,</hi> to whom
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115995:84"/>
the Jeſuites affix <hi>infallibility,</hi> whereby all the
errors are become <hi>incurable,</hi> though never ſo
palpable, becauſe it muſt be ſuppoſed they are
ſubject to none. I conclude this with that ſpeech
of <hi>Heinſius,</hi> a great defender of the Originall
Texts, <hi>Proleg. in Nov. Teſt. ſerio reſponſo haud
digni ſunt, qui aut variaſſe olim in quibuſdam
libros, aut ex iis minus emendatos cum cura reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutos
negant.</hi> And after. <hi>Satis ſit ejuſmodi varieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
eas eſſe, ut vel quae neceſſario credenda ſunt, non
ever tant, vel quae non credenda ſunt, non do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VIII. But now as I have cleared the <hi>Proleg.</hi>
and <hi>Appendix,</hi> from theſe conſequences of the
Adverſary, ſo his Argument, like a piece of
Ordnance overchanged, <hi>recoils</hi> with full ſtrength
upon himſelf; nor can all the <hi>Sophiſtry</hi> in the
world free him from the <hi>Guilt</hi> which he charges
upon us. For he not onely grants the ſame
<hi>Propoſition</hi> which we do, concerning <hi>various
Readings,</hi> but alſo grants, yea urges the <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi>
which <hi>Papiſts, Atheiſts, &amp;c.</hi> would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
thence, and which not we onely, but all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
men utterly deny, onely he denies the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</hi>
For thus the Argument runs, if it be
reduced into Syllogiſticall Forms. If there
be <hi>various Readings</hi> in the <hi>Originall</hi> Texts of
Scripture, then the Scripture is <hi>uncertain,
corrupt</hi> and <hi>doubtfull, and</hi> ſo cannot be of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
authority,</hi> whereby way is made for Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115995:84"/>
Atheiſme, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But there are <hi>various Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi>
in the <hi>Originall Texts</hi> of Scripture: <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi>
the Scripture is uncertain and corrupt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
This <hi>Concluſion</hi> we both deny, as <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious,</hi>
and therefore one or both the <hi>Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
from which it is inferred, muſt needs be falſe.
The <hi>Minor</hi> is granted by the Author of the
<hi>Prolegomena,</hi> as it is alſo by the <hi>Author</hi> of the
<hi>Conſiderations</hi> in the places alledged, and by all
men that will believe their eyes. But the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi>
or the <hi>Conſequence</hi> is denied by the <hi>Prole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomena,</hi>
and by all that have not joyned hands
with <hi>Papiſts, Atheiſts, &amp;c.</hi> who do utterly deny
that any ſuch inference can be made from the
<hi>various Readings,</hi> but that the <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
of the Scripture is ſtill the ſame, which the
Author of the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> not only affirms, but
proves and gives Reaſons for it; and upon this
he layes the weight of the cauſe, which neither
our <hi>Adverſary,</hi> nor all the <hi>Atheiſts, Papiſts,</hi>
or <hi>Antiſcripturiſts</hi> in the world are able to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow.
On the other ſide our Author not
onely grants the <hi>Minor,</hi> becauſe it is evident to
ſence, but grants the <hi>Major</hi> too, yea he urges
the conſequence all along in theſe <hi>Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
with much earneſtneſſe and vehemency,
(which all ſober Chriſtians abhor and deny.)
Now let all men judge, who is guilty of this
wretched Concluſion, he that grants the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,</hi>
which is ſo evident that none can deny
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115995:85"/>
it, but denies the <hi>Conſequence,</hi> and gives Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
againſt it, or he that grants both <hi>Major,</hi>
and <hi>Minor,</hi> denies onely the <hi>Concluſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IX. If it ſhall be ſaid, that the <hi>Conſiderations</hi>
do ſometimes deny, that <hi>various Readings</hi> infer
the uncertainty and corruptions of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
I anſwer, its true, that ſometimes he
ſeems to deny any ſuch inference. But when he
is in hot proſecution of his Adverſary, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
the clean contrary, as appears by his
whole ſecond <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Conſiderations,</hi> and
<hi>Chap. 7. Sect.</hi> 6. where he denies any difference in
Copies, either <hi>wilfully</hi> or by <hi>negligence.</hi> And
the third <hi>Chapter</hi> of his <hi>Conſiderations</hi> is
wholly ſpent againſt the <hi>various Readings</hi> of the
New Teſtament, which are onely out of <hi>Greek</hi>
MSS. and tells us, p. 193. <hi>that they create a
temptation that there is nothing ſound and entire in
the word of God</hi> p. 206. that <hi>the Conſequences are
lawfully derived.</hi> p. 207. that <hi>they do naturally
and neceſſarily flow:</hi> ſo p. 147. 161. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
throughout his Diſcourſe, he inferres from
the <hi>various Readings</hi> in the Appendix of the
<hi>Bible,</hi> (which are all out of the <hi>Originall Texts,</hi>
not any gathered out of <hi>Tranſlations)</hi> that
thereby is introduced <hi>utter uncertainty about all
ſacred truth,</hi> ſo that nothing is more clear then
that he makes the Conſequence of the <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
and <hi>corruption</hi> of the Scripture, to be
the neceſſary <hi>product</hi> of <hi>various Readings,</hi> and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:115995:85"/>
therefore that he hath plainly prevaricated, and
betrayed the cauſe which he ſeemed to contend
for; and his friends, as he makes them, <hi>Papiſts,
Athieſts, and Fanatick perſons,</hi> have cauſe to
thank him, for diſputing ſo doughtily on their
behalf. And ſo I conclude with that of <hi>Seneca
Controv. 3. l 4. Malo eſt in loco, qui habet rei
fortunam, accuſatoris invidiam.</hi> He is in an ill
caſe who accuſes another of what himſelf is
guilty; for <hi>Guilt,</hi> as one obſerves, though it
be the effect of ſome error, yet uſually it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
a kind of moderation in men, ſo a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> not to
be violent, in accuſing others of that which
may reflect upon themſelves, but here we ſee
it is otherwiſe, and from what root it proceeds,
I leave to every mans judgement.</p>
               <p>X. Having ſhewed the no conſequence of the
uncertainty and corruption of the Scripture,
from various Readings, I ſhall not need to
ſtand long upon the Particulars of <hi>Popery,
Atheiſme, fanaticall Antiſcripturiſme</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetaniſme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
mentioned by him, p. 147. For <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
he fears the pretended infallible guide &amp;c. wil
be found to lie at the doore</hi> of the Conſiderations.
p. 161. and p. 202. He doubts not but to hear
<hi>news from</hi> Rome <hi>concerning theſe varieties, there
having been no ſuch collections as yet made in the
world. Enough they are to fright poore unſtable
ſouls, into the arms of an infallible Judge.</hi> And
p. 207. <hi>We went from</hi> Rome <hi>under conduct of the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:115995:86"/>
purity of the Originalls, I wiſh none have a
mind to return thither again, under pretence of
their corruption.</hi> How theſe various Readings
ſhould be any prop, much leſſe the principal
<hi>Pillar</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> I cannot ſee, nor doth our
Author prove. His meaning it may be is, that
<hi>Papiſts</hi> do hence infer the Scripture to be <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
and the <hi>Originall Texts</hi> to be <hi>corrupt,</hi> ſo
that they can be no ſure ground of faith, and
therefore that all muſt flie to an <hi>infallible Judge,</hi>
and rely upon the <hi>vulgar Latine.</hi> But theſe
grounds we have already taken away, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that notwithſtanding ſuch <hi>various Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,</hi>
the Scriptures are ſtill the <hi>certain rule</hi> of
faith, and the <hi>Originall</hi> Texts the <hi>authentick
rule</hi> of all <hi>Tranſlations: v. Proleg.</hi> 7. Beſides,
let our Author ſhew that any of the <hi>various
Readings,</hi> by us collected, contain any thing
againſt either <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>good life,</hi> or make for the
<hi>Romaniſts</hi> in any of the <hi>Controverſies</hi> between
them and us; let him inſtance in any if he
can. In that place of 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 7. are ſome
words left out in many ancient Copies, but there
is nothing contrary to the <hi>Analogy of faith</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted.
That point of the <hi>Trinity</hi> hath ground
enough beſides in <hi>Scripture,</hi> though theſe words
had not been in any <hi>copy;</hi> and whether they were
razed out of ſome Copies by the <hi>Arrians,</hi> as
ſome of the Ancients ſuppoſe, or whether left
out by <hi>caſuall error</hi> of the <hi>Tranſcriber</hi> in ſome
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:115995:86"/>
one Copy from which many others were deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and that error made uſe of by the <hi>Arrians,</hi>
yet here is nothing againſt <hi>faith</hi> affirmed in this
place, onely an <hi>omiſſion</hi> of ſome words in ſome
Copies. Beſides how can it be imagined that
theſe <hi>various Readings</hi> ſhould make way for
<hi>Popery,</hi> when the firſt and chief Collectors of
them were the chief oppoſers of <hi>Popery?</hi> as
this Author affirms, <hi>p.</hi> 189. where he reckons
up <hi>Stephanus, Beza, Camerarius, Draſius,
Heinſius, Grotius, de Dieu, Capellus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XI. If it be ſaid, that <hi>Papiſts</hi> mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Greek</hi> Text, but onely preferred the
<hi>vulgar Latine</hi> before all other <hi>Latine Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and meant onely, that it contained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

and divers others. 2. Doth our Adverſary
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:115995:87"/>
think that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> can juſtly deduce any
ſuch <hi>Concluſions</hi> from the <hi>various Readings?</hi>
If he think ſo, then he pleads their cauſe, and
joyns hands with them againſt the <hi>Originall
Texts;</hi> if no, Why doth he urge their deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
againſt us? 3. Though ſome men pervert
and abuſe the <hi>Truth</hi> to bad ends, muſt the <hi>Truth</hi>
therefore be denied, becauſe a bad uſe is made
of it? There never wanted thoſe who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
the Scripture to their own deſtruction;
but is the Scripture the worſe, or muſt not the
lawfull uſe of it be permitted? All truth is from
God, the Author of <hi>Truth,</hi> he needs not mens
policies to defend it, much leſſe can it be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
by <hi>untruths.</hi> Thoſe <hi>pious frauds,</hi> when diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
have proved <hi>prejudiciall</hi> to the <hi>Truth</hi> for
which they were deviſed.</p>
               <p>XII. He confeſſeth, p. 206. <hi>That the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facer
doth not own theſe wretched Conſequences,
but he knows full well who think them to be juſt.</hi>
It is true, he knows ſome <hi>Romaniſts</hi> and others
think ſo, and it ſeems our <hi>Author</hi> thinks ſo too.
But this <hi>Author</hi> knows alſo, that the <hi>Prefacer</hi>
hath clearly proved, both againſt the <hi>Papiſt</hi> and
himſelf, that the <hi>Conſequence</hi> is falſe and invalid,
and that neither of them have juſt cauſe to think
ſo; and therefore, that this ought not to be by
him objected. It had been a more <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
practice for him to ſhew the <hi>Inconſequence</hi> of
ſuch <hi>Concluſions</hi> from ſuch <hi>Premiſſes</hi> as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:115995:87"/>
by himſelf, then to play faſt and looſe, or
to calumniate them, who granting what cannot
be denied, no not by himſelf, do yet uphold the
<hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and labour to prove
that no ſuch things do follow as are by ſuch
men ſurmized.</p>
               <p>XIII. His uncharitable intimation, as if the
deſign of the <hi>Publiſher</hi> of the <hi>various Readings</hi>
were to return to <hi>Rome</hi> again, to an infallible
Judge, reflects upon the chief defenders of the
<hi>Proteſtant</hi> Profeſſion againſt the Errors of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and the <hi>Suppoſition</hi> is as true as the <hi>Poſition,</hi> in
that flower of his diſcourſe, (twice repeated,
p. 161. and 282. <hi>(Hoc Ithacus velit)</hi> if the
reſt of the verſe, <hi>(magno mercentur Atreidae)</hi>
be added to it. It is well known, that the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
of the <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> when he kept his Act
<hi>pro Gradu,</hi> at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> about twenty years
ago, maintained this <hi>Queſtion; Pontifex Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus
non eſt judex infallibilis in controverſiis

the ſame <hi>Judgement,</hi> and to be rather more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in that perſwaſion, then any way doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of it. And what news can we expect from
<hi>Rome</hi> concerning theſe <hi>various Readings,</hi> when
the ſame thing is not new with them, as appears
by the Notes of <hi>Lucas Brugenſis, Nobilius,</hi> and
others, which far exceed in bulk any thing that
we have done, and wherein more <hi>MSS.</hi> were
uſed: which labours of theirs have ever been of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:115995:88"/>
high eſteem among the Learnedſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi>
as well as thoſe of their own party. And how
can they juſtly object theſe <hi>various Readings</hi>
againſt us, when far more have been obſerved
by themſelves in the <hi>Vulgar Latine,</hi> which yet
they will not have to derogate from its ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme

the affirming that we have no more reaſon to

to believe thoſe who deny they have any ſuch tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

with the Chriſtian Church. <hi>Whether the affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe things gives not more advantage to</hi>
Atheists, <hi>then to affirm that there are</hi> various
Readings <hi>in Scripture, in matters that do not

<hi>This I am ſure gives no advantage in the

Antiſcripturiſts.</hi> The certainty and divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Scripture hath been made good not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
ſuch <hi>various Readings,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no juſt ground can be hence gathered of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
the Scriptures.</hi> He tells us of a Treatiſe
written by ſome body, who upon ſuch Principles
rejects the whole Scriptures as uſeleſſe. I can
ſay nothing of the book which I have not ſeen,
nor known, upon what Principles it proceeds;
if our Author think his Arguments to be
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:115995:89"/>
good, let him produce them, and I doubt not
but they will be quickly anſwered. In the mean
time he may pleaſe to conſider, whether he that
rejects all other proofs for the <hi>Divine Originall</hi>
of Scripture, and relies onely upon its <hi>own light
and ſelf-evidence,</hi> which is denied in this caſe
to be ſufficient by many Learned <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> do
not give greater occaſion to thoſe, who bragg
of their <hi>new Lights,</hi> and daily increaſe amongſt
us, to reject all Scripture as uſeleſſe, then he
that allows ſuch <hi>various Readings</hi> in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
as we have declared? And whether the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
of all diſcipline and order of <hi>Government</hi>
in the Church, and leaving every man to follow
his own fancie, againſt both <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
which tell us, <hi>That they ſhould ſeek the
Law at the Prieſts mouth,</hi> and that they <hi>who
will not hear the Church, are to be accounted as
Publicans and Heathens,</hi> have not made way to
thoſe <hi>Antiſcripturiſts, Familiſts</hi> and other <hi>Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
which ſwarm among us, and like the <hi>Locuſts

               </p>
               <p>XVI. Laſtly, for <hi>Mahumetaniſme;</hi> It is true,
<hi>Mahomet</hi> accuſeth the <hi>Jews</hi> of corrupting the
<hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> for corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>New,</hi> and ſaith, that he was ſent of God
to reform all, <hi>Surat.</hi> 4. 5. 11. and ſome of his
followers pretend that there was ſomething al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
in <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. about the <hi>Comforter</hi> which
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:115995:89"/>
Chriſt promiſed to ſend, as if there had been
ſomething in that place foretold of <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have razed out and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.
But doth our Author believe that any
<hi>various Readings</hi> gathered out of any <hi>MSS.</hi> or
<hi>Printed Copies,</hi> or <hi>ancient Tranſlations</hi> do inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
any ſuch thing of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> or favour any

               </argument>
               <p>I. BEfore we leave this Charge about <hi>various
Readings,</hi> I muſt ſay ſomething of the
<hi>Tranſlations</hi> exhibited in the <hi>Bibia Polyglotta;</hi>
againſt which our Author ſpends his laſt <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
upon pretence, that we aſſign them another
uſe then he allows, <hi>viz. That they are the rules
by which the Originall is to be corrected;</hi> for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this he takes occaſion to inveigh againſt them
all, to ſhew how unfit they are for this end, and
further, how unuſefull for any other end. Now,
though I might well paſſe over all that is ſaid
upon this ſuppoſition, as not concerned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
having already declared for what uſe theſe
<hi>Tranſlations</hi> are here Printed, and that though
we allow <hi>various Readings</hi> to be gathered out of
them in ſome caſes, and with ſome limitations,
as is above declared, yet we neither make them
equall with, much leſſe <hi>prefer</hi> them above the
<hi>Originalls,</hi> but make them <hi>ſubſervient</hi> to them,
yet, becauſe under colour of this, he defames and
aſperſeth all the <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> as of no uſe, nor
deſerving any eſteem, I ſhall take a brief view of
the moſt materiall paſſages in this <hi>invective,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
the <hi>Reader</hi> for full ſatisfaction to the
<hi>Prolegomena,</hi> where the <hi>uſe, antiquity,</hi> and <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
of every <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> and all the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
about any of them, are at large handled.</p>
               <p>II. He prefaces his <hi>Invective</hi> with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:115995:90"/>
of the uſefulneſſe of them in
ſome caſes, and <hi>p.</hi> 206 calls the Work, <hi>a Noble
collection of Tranſlations;</hi> but this is, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
onely as a Shooing-horn to draw on the
better this aſperſion which he caſts upon them
afterwards, and therefore I account his <hi>commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi>
to be only, as I obſerved before out of

reproach.</hi> Firſt, he begins with the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick,</hi>
for the Honour he bears to the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendly
Learned <hi>Publiſher</hi> of it, as he affirms
(meaning Maſter <hi>Pocock)</hi> or rather indeed,
becauſe he thought he might have more colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
pretence to vilifie this <hi>Tranſlation</hi> then
ſome of the other, otherwiſe he ſhould rather

always did, and doth ſtill very much eſteem, and
did foreſee, and ſo declared what uſe might be
made of his words by ſome perſons diſaffected
to the Work, to the defaming of the whole, as
I now finde by experience; yet ſeeing it was
only his particular judgement, and every man
had liberty to judge of his reaſons as he ſaw
cauſe, (ſome things alſo being <hi>mollified</hi> and <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered</hi>
upon the <hi>Publiſhers</hi> Letters, from the firſt

then to take upon him to determine any thing

<hi>Prolegom.</hi> 14. which the <hi>Reader</hi> may conſult,
if he pleaſe.</p>
               <p>III. I ſhall not therefore go about to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe
or determine that <hi>Queſtion,</hi> whether it be

(though it ſeems ſcarcely credible, that

a <hi>Tranſlation</hi> made by a <hi>Jew</hi> in their publike aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies)
yet I cannot but obſerve how our
Adverſary doth miſreport &amp; wrong the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Author of that Preface, in reciting his words
and opinions, whom yet he ſeems to magnifie,
and therefore it is the leſſe to be wondered that
he deals ſo with others, whom he labours what
he can to vilifie: for he makes him to write
things neither true, nor agreeing to common
ſence, but untrue, and contradictory to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:115995:92"/>
For <hi>p.</hi> 322. he ſaith, <hi>That he,</hi> (viz.
Mr <hi>Pocock)</hi> tells us, <hi>This Tranſlation is a</hi> Cento
<hi>made up of many ill ſuited pieces, there being no
Tranſlation in that Language extant of the</hi> Old
Teſtament, which is a plain <hi>contradiction;</hi> for
if there be no <hi>Tranſlation</hi> in the <hi>Arabick</hi> extant,
how came this to be extant, and why doth he
call it an <hi>Arabick Tranſlation,</hi> if there be none
in that Language? and why doth he ſpeak, <hi>pag.
324.</hi> of <hi>other Arabick Tranſlations,</hi> if there be
none at all? Mr. <hi>Pocock</hi> indeed ſaith, That it
is not all made by one <hi>Author,</hi> nor all <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately</hi>
out of the <hi>Hebrew;</hi> but ſome out of the
<hi>Hebrew,</hi> ſome out of the <hi>Syriack,</hi> and part out

ſence, as to ſay there was none at all. I
looked among the <hi>Errata,</hi> but could not finde
any <hi>Error</hi> noted there: nor can he ſay, that there
is no other <hi>Tranſlation</hi> in the <hi>Arabick</hi> but this,
and that this was his meaning, for himſelf tells
us of divers others <hi>Tranſlations:</hi> and he could
not but ſee in the <hi>Prolegom.</hi> 14. mention made
of divers <hi>Tranſlations</hi> made by <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſince

<hi>Pocock</hi> ſaith out of <hi>Abulfeda</hi> is onely, that
there was no <hi>Arabick verſion</hi> out of the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
before his time in <hi>Arabick letters,</hi> not denying
but that there were <hi>Arabick Tranſlations</hi> out of
the LXX. and the <hi>Syriack</hi> long before, and
that there might be alſo ſome out of the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
into <hi>Arabick</hi> but not in <hi>Arabick Characters.</hi>
Again he makes Mr. <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

part of that <hi>Tranſlation</hi> was made about
the year 950. which he doth no where affirm,
but onely ſaith that the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> which he
aſcribes to <hi>Saadias,</hi> was about that time, which
is not denied, if it be his; but when any of the
other parts were tranſlated, he ſaith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>IV. Further, he makes him ſay, <hi>That this
Tranſlation of Saadias was interpreted, and
changed in ſundry things, &amp;c.</hi> which he no where

Pentateuch</hi> (which the <hi>Jews</hi> uſed in their
<hi>Tranſlations) into</hi> Arabick, <hi>by one who might
change ſome words.</hi> But what is this to a <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation</hi>
or <hi>Interpretation?</hi> Was the <hi>Pentateuch
tranſlated</hi> into <hi>Arabick,</hi> when the <hi>Hebrew let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
was changed into <hi>Arabick?</hi> Beſides he no
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:115995:93"/>
where makes the <hi>Interpreter</hi> to have been a
<hi>Mahumetane,</hi> or <hi>Samaritane,</hi> as this Author
miſreports him, but to be <hi>R. Saadias</hi> a <hi>Jew,</hi>
but that he who <hi>tranſcribed,</hi> or put it into <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick
Characters,</hi> might change ſome words, to
<hi>comply</hi> the better with <hi>Mahumetanes,</hi> under
whom thoſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> lived. And laſtly Mr.
<hi>Pocock</hi> tells us, that theſe things he cannot affirm
upon <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>undoubted</hi> grounds, but onely
upon probable reaſons. Thus modeſtly he
writes. whereas this Author ſpeaks confidently
of things which he never underſtood. Now if
any deſire to know what uſe may be of this
<hi>Arabick verſion,</hi> what Copies we uſed? what
<hi>Tranſlations</hi> there are? he may peruſe if he pleaſe
<hi>Proleg.</hi> 14. where he ſhall not find any ſuch uſe,
either of this, or any other <hi>Tranſlation</hi> as our
Adverſary feigns, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Correct the Originalls,</hi>
or as he elſewhere expreſſes it, <hi>to correct the
Word of God.</hi>

                  <hi>V. In the next place he falls upon the</hi> Syriack,
<hi>that noble, ancient,</hi> Oriental <hi>treaſure, made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
out of the</hi> Hebrew, <hi>of which he tells
us, he believes ſome part of it was made out of
the</hi> Hebrew, <hi>as if the</hi> major <hi>part were out of the
LXX. or ſome other</hi> Tranſlation, <hi>which all
that know of it any thing, know to be utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true.
Sometimes it varies in ſome words (of
no importance) from our modern</hi> Hebrew <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,
which ſhews (as learned</hi> Hottinger <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves)
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115995:93"/>
ſome</hi> various <hi>or</hi> different <hi>Reading be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
that Copy and ours, but none ever
doubted that it was out of the</hi> Hebrew. <hi>Then
he queſtions the</hi> Antiquity <hi>of it,</hi> He knows not
when, where, nor by whom it was made, <hi>if he
will be ignorant of theſe things, who can help
it? otherwiſe he might have learned of thoſe
that have ſpent more time in the ſearch of theſe
things then himſelf. That the conſtant</hi> opinion
<hi>and</hi> tradition <hi>of the</hi> Eaſtern Churches <hi>is, that it
was either made in the age the</hi> Apoſtles <hi>lived in,
or not long after, I mean that which they call
the</hi> ſimple Edition <hi>(which is by us followed)
which alone were enough to prove the</hi> antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>of it, as</hi> Bootius <hi>(as great an</hi> aſſertor <hi>of the</hi>

c. 19. p. 183. <hi>proves, when he ſaith,</hi> it were intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
boldneſſe, and no leſſe fooliſh, not to give credit
to them in this buſineſs, then if any Syrian or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,
who never had been in <hi>Europe,</hi> and were
altogether ignorant of the Latine <hi>(as he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
them to be of the</hi> Syriack <hi>tongue who
queſtion the antiquity of the Tranſlation)</hi> and
had never ſeen or read any Latine book, ſhould
queſtion whether the vulgar Latine Tranſlation
of the New Teſtament, of which he had never
heard but by report, were of that antiquity, which
they of the Latine Church aſcribe unto it, and
by conſtant Tradition have alwayes done, and
ſhould affirm it was made many ages after. And
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:115995:94"/>
their raſhneſſe, <hi>as he there addes,</hi> is ſo much the
more deteſtable, becauſe we have moſt ſtrong Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to prove the great antiquity of it, as that
it muſt needs be in the third Century at leaſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Diodorus Tarſenſis, Theodorus Mopſueſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
Polychronius, Procopius, Gazaeus,</hi> and others,
who lived ſome of them in the fourth Century, do
often mention and commend a Greek Tranſlation
then in uſe, which was made out of the Syriack.
<hi>He ſaith further,</hi> That there can be no place for
doubting in this matter, becauſe the Syrians have
many Fathers of their own Nation, ſome ſince,
others long before <hi>Diodorus,</hi> who wrote in their
own <hi>Syriack</hi> language, and quote many places out
of the <hi>Syriack</hi> Tranſlation of the Old Teſtament,
made out of the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> which agree <hi>verbatim</hi>
with that which we have, of which he is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
by thoſe many inſtances which he could give
out of that great <hi>Syriack</hi> MS. called <hi>Catena
Syriaca in Evangelia,</hi> which he had among many
other <hi>Syriack</hi> books, out of the Library <hi>of that
famous and</hi> Reverend <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher.</p>
               <p>VI. The great <hi>antiquity</hi> of this <hi>Verſion</hi> is alſo
proved <hi>Proleg.</hi> 13. out of the <hi>ancient Writers</hi>
which mention it, Saint <hi>Baſil,</hi> Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi>
Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> Saint <hi>Auguſtine, Euſebius,</hi> and
others, mentioned in the ancient <hi>Greek Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaſt,</hi>
beſides <hi>Jacobus Syrus,</hi> (who was preſent at
the <hi>Nicene Councel)</hi> and <hi>Ephraim Magnus,</hi> who
do both mention this <hi>Syriack Tranſlation,</hi> and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:115995:94"/>
commented upon it in <hi>Syriack.</hi> Beſides it muſt
needs be of great antiquity, when that other
and later <hi>Syriack Tranſlation</hi> was made out of
the LXX. above a thouſand years ago, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by <hi>Maſius</hi> in <hi>Joſ.</hi> who had ſome <hi>Syriack</hi>
books of that <hi>Tranſlation</hi> written before that
time, and ſome <hi>Syriack Copies</hi> of the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament</hi>
are now remaining in the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Florences Library</hi> (as I had from one reſiding
there, who peruſed the ſame MSS.) which appear
to have been written above a thouſand years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,
of which with other Arguments, thoſe that
pleaſe may read <hi>Prolegomena</hi> 13. The <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary</hi>
further tells us, <hi>That in many places
it evidently followed another corrupt Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that it paſſed through the hands of men
ignorant and ſuſpicious, againſt whoſe frauds and
folly by reaſon of the paucity of Copies we have no
relief:</hi> but for proof of all we have not a word,
nor any teſtimony, nor any inſtance of any
<hi>Tranſlation</hi> it followed at all, much leſſe of any
corruption, but all this you muſt take upon his
word, againſt the judgement of all learned
men, who have ſome of them ſpent more years
in this <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> then he ever ſpent dayes,
and therefore what credit his bare <hi>ipſe dixit</hi>
may have, let any wiſe man judge.</p>
               <p>VII. Laſtly, having nothing to ſay againſt this
<hi>Tranſlation</hi> in particular, he falls upon the
<hi>Scribe</hi> of that <hi>Cambridge MS.</hi> which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115995:95"/>
with the reſt, for deſiring the prayers of
the Saints for him, and that God would hear
them on his behalf, as if the credit of an <hi>anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Tranſlation</hi> depended upon any addition
made by a <hi>Tranſcriber,</hi> who lived, it may be, a
thouſand years after: by which reaſon he might
reject the <hi>Greek Text</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi>
becauſe in ſome old MSS. ſome ſuch <hi>prayers</hi> and
<hi>ejaculations</hi> may be found added by the <hi>Scribes</hi>
of thoſe Copies.</p>
               <p>VIII. Thirdly, He falls foul upon the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane
Pentateuch</hi> and <hi>Verſion,</hi> p. 327. and 260. He
labours firſt to prove what no body denies, <hi>That
their</hi> Pentateuch <hi>cannot vie with the</hi> Hebrew
<hi>Text,</hi> p. 329. when as he could not but read
<hi>Proleg.</hi> 11. that it is there expreſly affirmed, that
their <hi>Pentateuch</hi> is not <hi>authentick,</hi> and that there
are ſome <hi>wilfull corruptions</hi> in it, as that about
<hi>mount Gerazim,</hi> and that it cannot ſtand in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
with the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> Then he proceeds
and tells us, <hi>that all is uncertain about them and
their</hi> Pentateuch, <hi>that it were no hard task to
manifeſt the uncertainty of what is fixed upon the
Originall of this</hi> Pentateuch <hi>in the</hi> Prolegom.
<hi>or to inforce thoſe conjectures which he oppoſeth,
but it is not in his preſent work, nor that he knows
of ever will be.</hi> In the mean time I hope what
is ſaid in the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> may ſtand firm, till it
be impugned or confuted, which I do not fear
to be done by our Author in haſt. Yet though
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:115995:95"/>
I do not love to ſpend time about frivolous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions;
ſome things there be which I cannot
well paſſe by without notice.</p>
               <p>IX. Pag. 261. He ſaith, <hi>The Samaritanes
had not the Book of the Law from the Prieſt that
was ſent unto them by the King of</hi> Babylon, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they continued in their Idolatry, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
probably they had it when they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
by</hi> Hircanus, after their Temple was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
which had ſtood two hundred years, and
p. 262. 327. 329. <hi>That there are any of them at
this day, or have been theſe thouſand years laſt, is
unknown. That they continued in their Idolatry
till</hi> Hircanus <hi>his time, who ſubdued them: That
their</hi> Pentateuch was not uſed by any ancient
Chriſtians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which <hi>Paradoxes</hi> are <hi>viſible
untruths,</hi> affirmed without any the leaſt proof,
yea, againſt all <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> ancient and modern, and
againſt the <hi>judgement</hi> of all <hi>Learned men</hi> who
have written of this ſubject. <hi>That the</hi> Prieſt
<hi>taught them to fear the Lord,</hi> is expreſſed,
<hi>2 King.</hi> 17. 28. How this could be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> is not imaginable,
when as it is ſaid, that before that time, <hi>they fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not the Lord,</hi> and then it is ſaid, <hi>that they
feared the Lord,</hi> though withall <hi>they worſhipped
their Idols.</hi> That <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> the <hi>High Prieſts</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fled thither in <hi>Eſdras</hi> his time, and built a
<hi>Temple</hi> on <hi>Mount Gerazim,</hi> whither divers
<hi>Prieſts</hi> and other <hi>Jews</hi> alſo came, and there
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:115995:96"/>
worſhipped God, and offered ſacrifices (though
in a <hi>Schiſmaticall way)</hi> is out of doubt: and how
this could be done without the <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi>
is not to be conceived. That they continued in
their <hi>Iodolary</hi> till their <hi>Temple</hi> was deſtroyed by
<hi>Hircanus,</hi> is againſt all ancient <hi>Records,</hi> which
affirm the contrary, <hi>Joſeph. lib. 9. cap. ult.</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Poſtquam Legem, &amp; Dei colendi rationem ab iis,

The ſame is affirmed by ſome <hi>Rabbins,</hi> produced
<hi>Prolegom.</hi> 11. though out of their innate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
they forge many calumnies and untruths
againſt them. But that after their <hi>Temple</hi> was
deſtroyed by <hi>Hircanus,</hi> that they ſhould then,
and not before, receive the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> is ſuch
a groundleſſe fancie, that I could hardly think
our Author hoped that any would believe it.
Can any man imagine, that for two hundred
years they ſhould offer <hi>ſacrifices,</hi> and obſerve
the <hi>Law,</hi> without any <hi>Copy</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and after
their <hi>Temple</hi> was deſtroyed, when they had
no place to worſhip in, that they ſhould then
receive it, and that in a ſtrange <hi>Character,</hi> and
onely the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> when as if <hi>Hircanus</hi> had
forced the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> upon them, he would,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:115995:96"/>
without doubt, have forced all the reſt of the
<hi>Jewiſh Canon</hi> upon them, and that in the <hi>Jews
Character.</hi> Pardon me, good <hi>Reader,</hi> if thy

               <p>X. Of the ſame ſtamp is that which follows:
<hi>That it is unknown that any of them are remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

That their</hi> Pentateuch <hi>was never uſed by any

               <p>XI. That no <hi>ancient Chriſtians made uſe of
their Pentateuch,</hi> is like the reſt. The Author
had read the contrary proved, <hi>Prolegom</hi> 11.

theſe men muſt not be reckoned among ancient

in ſuch an <hi>Adverſary,</hi> that he ſhould ſo boldly
affirm ſuch things, which are ſo eaſily detected,
and ſo plainly confuted. He alſo ſaith, that

no man that hath read <hi>Scaliger</hi> or <hi>Morinus</hi>

the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> and their <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> which
could not be found, either in the <hi>Scripture</hi> or

               <p>
                  <hi>XII. But he is much offended, p.</hi> 331. That
from the occaſionall mention of the <hi>Samaritane</hi>
Liturgie, and the pretended antiquity of it, the
Author of the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> falls, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome bitterneſſe, on thoſe that have laid aſide

<hi>And the</hi> Author <hi>of the</hi> Prolegomena <hi>could have

He tells us of the <hi>bulkie collections of various
Readings</hi> in this <hi>Paraphraſe;</hi> but he might have
obſerved by the Title, that there are not onely
<hi>various Readings,</hi> but alſo <hi>Obſervations,</hi> which
take up the greateſt part of that <hi>collection.</hi> And
as for <hi>Buxtorfs Babylonia,</hi> which he talks of by
hear-ſay, it is true, his Son ſent it me to be
Printed among other things in this <hi>Bible,</hi> with
a ſhort <hi>Preface</hi> of his own, but it came too
late, after our own <hi>Notes</hi> on that ſubject were
begun, and would have riſen to a greater bulk
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:115995:99"/>
then the laſt Volume of the <hi>Bible</hi> would well
bear. Whereupon I forbore to Print it, but ſhall
willingly communicate it to any that ſhal under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take

I conceive, to reſtore that <hi>ancient Tranſlation</hi> to
its <hi>purity,</hi> (though I conceive there is much done
already in our laſt Volume to that purpoſe) And
I think that <hi>Learned Author</hi> would never have

10. Sect.</hi> 12. but what he writes in preferring
it before the reſt, is I doubt, not ſo much out of
his eſteem of the <hi>Vulgar Latine,</hi> but thereby to
depreſſe the worth of the reſt, which the <hi>Vulgar
Reader</hi> muſt needs think to be very bad, when
this, which <hi>Vulgar Divines</hi> ſo cry out againſt, is
preferred before them all. He may enjoy his

               <p>XV. Now comes the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> which he
ſaith, muſt bear the weight of all; the moſt of
the reſt being taken out of it. Of this <hi>Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
we have written at large, <hi>Prolegom.</hi> 9. which
for its <hi>antiquity and hoary hairs,</hi> is moſt oppoſed
by all <hi>Novelliſts,</hi> though it be proved, in the
ſame <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> That it was publikely read in
the <hi>Synagogues</hi> for neer three hundred years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Chriſt;</hi> That our <hi>Saviour</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>
uſed it, and cited it more frequently then the
<hi>Hebrew Text,</hi> and thereby <hi>conſecrated</hi> it to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity:
That by this <hi>Tranſlation</hi> chiefly, (which
was by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> left to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt)</hi>
the <hi>Church,</hi> eſpecially among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> was
firſt gathered, and by it nouriſhed and built up,
and the world <hi>ſubdued</hi> to <hi>Chriſt:</hi> That for many
<hi>Centuries</hi> no other <hi>Tranſlation</hi> but this, and
ſuch as were made out of it, (excepting the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riack)</hi>
was uſed in the <hi>Church,</hi> nor is any other
uſed in the <hi>Greek Church</hi> to this day. That this
was that which the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine Fathers</hi>
expounded, illuſtrated, out of which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
the people, confuted <hi>Hereſies,</hi> and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the <hi>Truth:</hi> That this which we now
have, is the ſame for <hi>ſubſtance</hi> with that ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uſed, (though in ſome things, by the injury
of times, and frequent tranſcriptions vitiated)
which, with all the ſeverall queſtions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
about this <hi>Tranſlation</hi> are at large
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:115995:100"/>
diſcuſſed and handled, to which I muſt refer the

queſtions raiſed by this <hi>Author,</hi> or others, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and all their aſperſions caſt upon it wiped

highly valued it, as is ſhewed out of <hi>Scaliger,

I ſhall not meddle with now; all of them, and a
great deal more, is related and anſwered in the
ſame <hi>Prolegom.</hi> 9. onely I cannot but obſerve
how he overlaſhes ſtill, when he affirms that
moſt of the <hi>Verſions</hi> in the <hi>Biblia Polyglotta</hi> are
evidently taken out of it, which he cannot with
any colour affirm of any but the <hi>Arabick,</hi> of
which yet himſelf formerly told us, the <hi>Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch</hi>
was tranſlated out of the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and
ſome part out of the <hi>Syriack,</hi> as for the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi>
the <hi>Samaritane Verſion,</hi> the <hi>Syriack, Chaldee,</hi> and
the <hi>Vulgar Latine,</hi> they are all out of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi>
except the <hi>Pſalms</hi> in the <hi>Vulgar Latine,</hi>
which ſeem to be out of the <hi>LXX.</hi> Though it
may be here and there in ſome words they may
agree with the <hi>LXX.</hi> yet this gives not the leaſt
colour to affirm that they were taken out of it.</p>

XVI. Beſides we may obſerve upon what weak
grounds he goes, when he ſticks not to inſiſt
upon that Argument againſt the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> that
the <hi>Originall Copy</hi> was burnt in the <hi>Library</hi> of
<hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Caeſars</hi> time, to prove that there
are no true Copies now left, which <hi>childiſh</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
he knew was anſwered <hi>Proleg. 9. Sect.
49.</hi> ſo as might have made any man of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
diſcretion forbear to urge it: for it is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and on all hands confeſt, that there were
<hi>thouſands of Copies</hi> every where extant among
the <hi>Jews,</hi> and read <hi>publickly</hi> in their <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues</hi>
all the world over, and ſo had been for
ſome hundred of years before the burning of <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomies
Library,</hi> ſo that the loſſe of that <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi>
Copy (though it may be juſtly doubted
whether it periſhed in that conflagration or no,
as is there ſhewed) can no more prove that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
ages have not the true Copy of it,
then it can be inferred that we have no <hi>true Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies</hi>
of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek Texts</hi> becauſe
the firſt <hi>Originalls</hi> have been loſt many ages
ſince, as among other things is there ſhewed.</p>
               <p>XVII. The <hi>Aethiopick</hi> and <hi>Perſian Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
which he falls upon in the laſt place, <hi>are
the worſt and moſt corrupt in the world. He can
find no uſe of the Perſian, but onely to ſhew that
there is ſuch an uſeleſſe thing in the world. The
Aethiopick is the Novel endeavour of an illiterate
perſon. He knows not whether ſome of them be
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:115995:101"/>
in uſe now in the world, he is ſure that it were
well that they be not; had he not ſeen them, he
could not have imagined any had been ſo bad. He
thinks ſome Jews had a hand in one for money.</hi>
Thus ſome men ſhoot their bolts at randome.
It is ſufficient that learned men, and ſuch as are
able to judge, do acknowledge the uſe of them,
and thankfully receive the publiſhing of them.
The <hi>antiquity</hi> and <hi>uſe</hi> of both, eſpecially of the
<hi>Aethiopick,</hi> is declared <hi>Proleg.</hi> 14. and 15. What is
there ſaid and proved, will I doubt not <hi>overba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance</hi>
what is by him <hi>barely affirmed</hi> to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
That the <hi>Aethiopick</hi> is now uſed, and
hath been ſince the converſion of that Nation,
among the <hi>Abyſſines,</hi> through thoſe large Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories,
conſiſting of many <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by good authority, and ſundry reaſons, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Scaliger.</hi> Our Author knows not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be any where uſed, but I think there is
ſcarce any beſides himſelf that doubts it, that
doth not ſhut his eyes againſt the clear light.
Concerning the <hi>Perſian,</hi> it is acknowledged in
the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> not to be that <hi>ancient Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
mentioned by <hi>Theodoret</hi> and others of the
Ancients, of which it may be doubted whether
any part of it be extant: as alſo that it was
made out of the <hi>Syriack,</hi> not immediately out
of the <hi>Greek,</hi> yet that it may be uſefull, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſhewed, <hi>Proleg.</hi> 15. in diverſe particulars,
and that this Copy we have Printed, was written
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:115995:101"/>
three hundred years ago, but how long
before the <hi>Tranſlation</hi> it ſelf was made, we
cannot determine. How the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould have a
hand in any of the <hi>Tranſlations</hi> is a fancie which
I think never lodged in any mans breaſt but his
own, nor can he ſhew any ground for it. It
may as well be ſaid, that <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metanes</hi>
made all theſe <hi>Tranſlations</hi> for the
uſe of <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Becauſe the <hi>Tranſcriber</hi> of
the <hi>Aethiopick,</hi> (as it is rendred in <hi>Latine)</hi>
makes Saint <hi>John Biſhop of Conſtantinople</hi> (though
it be doubtfull whether it may be ſo rendred,
as he might have ſeen in the Annotations, and
the <hi>Aethiopick</hi> word is not <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
though the learned Tranſlator of it into <hi>Latine</hi>
conjectured it migh be there meant) therefore
the <hi>Aethiopick Tranſlator</hi> muſt be <hi>illiterate,</hi> and
the <hi>Tranſlation novel,</hi> when as in the <hi>Syriack,</hi>
our Author could diſtinguiſh between the
<hi>Scribe</hi> and the <hi>Tranſlator,</hi> and not impute the
error of the one to the other. And as for the
<hi>antiquity,</hi> it is one thing to ſay, another thing
to prove: let him anſwer the reaſons in the
<hi>Prolegomena,</hi> or bring better of his own, and
we ſhall believe him, otherwiſe his bare autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
will not be ſufficient to command aſſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
reaſon.</p>
               <p>XVIII. By this which we have ſaid it appears,
that as our Author hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eigned to himſelf an
Adverſary when he had none, that ſo he might
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:115995:102"/>
have ſome pretence of depreſſing the ſeverall
<hi>Tranſlations,</hi> ſo that which is ſaid by him, we
might well have paſſed by, but that our ſilence
would have been by him interpreted as an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of the truth of his affirmations.
And although his <hi>invectives</hi> be <hi>groundleſſe</hi> and
<hi>vain,</hi> yet I have good <hi>ground</hi> to believe, that
there is ſomething elſe in the <hi>Tranſlations</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
(which he is not willing to mention)
which hath cauſed all this <hi>bitterneſſe</hi> againſt
them. It appears by theſe <hi>ancient Tranſlations</hi>
that what our <hi>Sectaries</hi> have cried down in the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Popiſh innovations,</hi> viz.
<hi>Epiſcopall Government, ſet forms of Liturgies,
Obſervation of Feſtivalls,</hi> beſides the <hi>Lords
day,</hi> were uſed (as they are ſtill) in thoſe <hi>Eaſtern
Churches</hi> planted by the <hi>Apostles</hi> and their <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors</hi>
in <hi>Aſia and Africk,</hi> from the firſt times
of their converſion, ſo that what theſe men
would exterminate as <hi>Romiſh</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian
Novelties</hi> have been antiently uſed by thoſe <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
and flouriſhing Churches,</hi> which never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
<hi>ſubjection</hi> to the <hi>See of Rome. Hinc illae
lachrymae:</hi> This is that <hi>Cordolium</hi> of our <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velliſts,</hi>
the practice of the <hi>univerſall Church of
Chriſt</hi> all the world over, which condemns their
<hi>innovations;</hi> which Argument is of more force
with conſidering men, then all the acute argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
drawn onely from ſtrength of reaſon.
For to condemn the practice of the <hi>Church</hi> of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:115995:102"/>
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> in all parts of the world, conſtantly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in all ages, is <hi>inſolentiſſima inſania,</hi> as
Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> long ſince. Theſe things with
ſome other ancient rites appear in the <hi>Syriack,
Arabick, Aethiopick,</hi> &amp;c. which I doubt were
as great motes in our <hi>Authors</hi> eye, which made
him ſo willing to quarrel with the <hi>Tranſlations,</hi>
and to cavil without a cauſe: and thus I have
briefly run over his <hi>invective</hi> againſt the <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations,</hi>
intreating the Reader for more full
ſatisfaction to conſult the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and by theſe <hi>Specimina</hi> which we have
given of his <hi>candor</hi> and <hi>love of truth,</hi> to judge
of the reſt of his <hi>Diſcourſe.</hi> And thus we have
done with the <hi>main Charge,</hi> the principal
Subject of his Book, the <hi>Various Readings,</hi>
and the <hi>Corruptions</hi> of the <hi>Originalls,</hi> which
he would thereupon infer. I ſhall proceed
now more briefly to that other <hi>principall
Charge,</hi> concerning the <hi>Punctation</hi> of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Text;</hi> after which we ſhall adde ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
about the <hi>ancient Hebrew Characters,</hi>
and of the uſe of the <hi>Septuagint Tranſlation,</hi>
towards the Knowledge of the <hi>Hebrew Tongue,</hi>
and ſo put an end to the Readers trouble and

the ſolemn Eſpouſall of the opinion of the novelty
of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> punctation in the <hi>Biblia Polyglotta,</hi>
was one chiefe occaſion of this Conſideration. <hi>The
opinion which he oppoſes, is by him in ſeverall
places declared, pag.</hi> 157. That the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
points or vowels, and accents, are a novell inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſome Judaicall Rabbins, about five or ſix
hundred years after the giving out of the Goſpel:
<hi>and p.</hi> 205. That the points or vowels and accents
are a late invention of the <hi>Tiberian Maſorites,</hi>
long after ſundry Tranſlations were extant in the
world. Their arbitrary invention, <hi>p. 208. c. 4.
in the contents, and p. 217, 218. p.</hi> 293. the
arbitrary inventions of ſome <hi>Jews,</hi> and that it is
lawfull for us to change them at pleaſure, <hi>p. 250.
258. 217, 218. Hence he deduces theſe</hi> Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
<hi>pag.</hi> 157. That the agreement of thoſe
Tranſlations before the ſuppoſed invention of
the points, with the Originall, cannot by juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
be tried by the preſent Text, as now
pointed and accented. <hi>And,</hi> that the whole credit
of our reading and interpretation of the Sripture,
as far as regulated by the preſent punctation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
ſolely on the faithfulneſſe and skill of thoſe
<hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe invention this is aſſerted to be. This
is one of thoſe two Principles, which being granted,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:115995:104"/>
there is no other way to be delivered from utter
incertainty in and about all ſacred truth. <hi>Epiſt.
p.</hi> 25. That all things are hereby made doubtfull
in Scripture, ſo that no certain truth can be
learned from the Scriptures: <hi>p.</hi> 211. yea, they
not onely make doubtfull the Authority of the
Scriptures, but wholly pluck it up by the roots:
<hi>pag.</hi> 213. And therefore he had rather that this
Work of the <hi>Biblia Polyglotta,</hi> and all Works of
the like kidne, were out of the world, then that
this one opinion ſhould be received with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
that unavoydably attend it. <hi>Thoſe</hi>

               <p>III. One would think by theſe paſſages, that
the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> had delivered ſome ſtrange and
dangerous opinion, never heard of before, which
overthrows all <hi>certainty,</hi> and by <hi>Conſequence</hi> all
<hi>Authority</hi> of Scripture, whereas it is there
proved, and ſhall now be made appear, that
the ſame doctrine of the <hi>Originall of points</hi> was
delivered by the greateſt Reformers, the moſt
<hi>Eminent Proteſtant Divines,</hi> both at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and ſince, and the beſt
skilled in <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Learning, which then were, or
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:115995:105"/>
at this day are in the <hi>Chriſtian world,</hi> and the
greateſt <hi>Patrons</hi> of the <hi>integrity</hi> of the <hi>Hebrew
Text.</hi> And that as the ſame is by the <hi>Prolego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi>
maintained, there is no <hi>prejudice</hi> at all
ariſing to the <hi>certainty</hi> of the <hi>Hebrew Text.</hi>
For we neither affirm that the <hi>vowels</hi> and <hi>accents</hi>
were invented by the <hi>Maſorites,</hi> but that the
<hi>Hebrew Tongue</hi> did always conſiſt of <hi>vowels</hi> and
<hi>conſonants. Aleph, Vau,</hi> and <hi>Jod,</hi> were the <hi>vowels</hi>
before the <hi>points</hi> were invented, as they were
alſo in the <hi>Syriack, Arabick,</hi> and other <hi>Eaſtern
Tongues:</hi> nor that theſe <hi>points</hi> which are now
uſed for <hi>vowels</hi> and <hi>accents,</hi> were the <hi>arbitrary</hi>
invention of the <hi>Maſorites,</hi> but that they <hi>pointed</hi>
the <hi>Text</hi> according to the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>received
Reading,</hi> and not as they pleaſed; nor that it is
lawfull for any to reject their <hi>Reading</hi> at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
but that all are tyed to it, unleſſe ſome
error, or better reading can be clearly proved;
nor that the Authority of the reading depends
upon the <hi>Maſorites,</hi> but that they <hi>pointed</hi> it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the received <hi>Reading,</hi> which expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the true ſence of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> ſo that the
Controverſie is onely about the preſent <hi>points,</hi>
in regard of their <hi>forms,</hi> not of their <hi>force</hi> and
<hi>ſignification,</hi> which D. <hi>Prideaux</hi> well expreſſes.

characteribus,</hi> &amp;c. In which it is true, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> denyes the <hi>Antiquity</hi>
or <hi>Divine Originall</hi> of the preſent <hi>points;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
as I ſaid, he hath the <hi>concurrent judgement</hi>
of the Learnedſt <hi>Proteſtant Divines,</hi> and ableſt
<hi>Linguiſts;</hi> and maintains that they were long
after the time of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> yea, about five hundred
years after <hi>Chriſt;</hi> yet herein he writes with
that moderation, that he leaves every man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to judge as he pleaſeth, onely propounds
what ſeemed to him moſt probable.</p>
               <p>IV. Firſt then, for the true ſtating of the
<hi>Controverſie,</hi> which our <hi>Author</hi> wholly neglects,
we muſt diſtinguiſh between the <hi>vowels</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents,</hi>
in regard of their <hi>ſound</hi> and <hi>ſignification,</hi>
and the <hi>points</hi> and <hi>figures</hi> whereby they are now
ſignified or expreſſed: for it is frequently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
in the <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> that the <hi>Hebrew,</hi>
as all other <hi>Languages</hi> conſiſts of <hi>conſonants</hi> and
<hi>vowels,</hi> and that it hath its <hi>accents</hi> or <hi>tones,</hi>
though not alwayes noted by <hi>points</hi> in every
word as they are now. Thus <hi>Druſius, de recta

whence he obſerves, <hi>p. 285. that the Hebrews
had the uſe of vowels, or elſe he cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
his words; for if they did it</hi> perraro, <hi>they
did it ſometimes.</hi> He did not, or rather he
would not underſtand his words; for he could
not but know, that by <hi>vowels, Hierome</hi> meant
not the <hi>moderne points,</hi> but the <hi>ancient vowels</hi>
then in uſe. I would gladly know of him how
<hi>ſalim</hi> and <hi>ſalem</hi> are written in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> whether
<hi>ſalim</hi> be not with <hi>Jod,</hi> and <hi>ſalem</hi> without it:
and then whether in that place <hi>Hierome</hi> could
meane any thing but <hi>Jod</hi> by <hi>vocalis media.</hi> For
the vowels which the Hebrewes uſed in St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roms</hi>
time, they uſed <hi>perraro</hi> very ſeldome in
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:115995:108"/>
the middle of words, and moſt frequently in the
beginning and end. And ſo its true, they uſed
thoſe <hi>vocales literae,</hi> which were the <hi>matres le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionis;</hi>
but the <hi>puncta vocalia,</hi> the vowels now
uſed in our Bibles, are uſed more frequently in

for, <hi>conſona ſemper ſyllabam inchoat.</hi> Therefore
not the <hi>puncta vocalia,</hi> but the <hi>literae vocales,</hi>
were the onely vowels in St. <hi>Hieroms</hi> time. And
conſequently our <hi>Conſiderator</hi> by his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion

were the authors of the <hi>points,</hi> that they
affixed them not <hi>pro arbitrio,</hi> as they pleaſed, or
made what reading they thought fit, but that

received as the true ſence and meaning of the

<hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets.</hi> I ſay generally; for as
appears in the precedent <hi>Section,</hi> in the words
cited out of <hi>Origens Hexapla,</hi> which alſo may
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:115995:108"/>
appeare out of the LXX. <hi>Hierome,</hi> and others
that were before the <hi>Maſorites,</hi> they pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
ſome letters and vowels otherwiſe then the

ad <hi>Euagr.</hi> tranſcribing <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 18, 19, 20. into

there want not rules to try which is the beſt

Maſorites</hi> the authors of the <hi>points,</hi> tyes all
as ſtrictly to the reading by <hi>points,</hi> as if they
had been by <hi>Ezra,</hi> and left it not to be altered
at every mans pleaſure. All which is ſaid in
the <hi>Proleg.</hi> which deny that the <hi>Maſorites at
pleaſure pointed the Text,</hi> and which neceſſarily
follows, <hi>that it's lawfull for any whatſoever to
alter the reading at pleaſure;</hi> which as it proves
the charge of our <hi>Author</hi> to be groundleſſe, ſo
it takes away his maine arguments againſt the
<hi>novelty</hi> of the points, <hi>viz.</hi> That the reading
would depend upon the authority of the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,</hi>
and that it would be altogether <hi>uncertaine,</hi>
and ſo the <hi>authority</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> would be
taken away. For both theſe are altogether
<hi>vaine</hi> and <hi>groundleſſe,</hi> ſuppoſing that the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorites</hi>
did not point the words <hi>pro arbitrio,</hi> but
were tyed to the common received reading
which they expreſſed by their <hi>punctation,</hi> for
the Text was generally ſo read by the <hi>Chriſtian
Church</hi> as it is now, as appears both by the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Copies</hi> among them, and by the <hi>Comments</hi>
and <hi>Expoſitions</hi> and <hi>Tranſlations</hi> of the <hi>ancient
Writers of the Church.</hi> The reading and Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
therefore of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are not regulated
by the <hi>Maſorites,</hi> or depend upon their skill and
diligence in <hi>punctation;</hi> for if their <hi>punctation</hi>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:115995:109"/>
had never been, the <hi>reading</hi> had been the ſame
it is: Nor doe theſe rely upon the <hi>Maſorites,</hi>
but upon the <hi>Text</hi> it ſelfe, and the true reading
of it continued and preſerved in the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Chriſt;</hi> which becauſe the <hi>Maſorites</hi> had well
expreſſed by their <hi>points,</hi> the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi>
received their <hi>punctation,</hi> not upon <hi>their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
but as I ſaid, becauſe it expreſſed the <hi>true
ſenſe</hi> received in the <hi>Church of God:</hi> and withal,
becauſe they ſaw it conduced much to the more
eaſie reading of the <hi>Text.</hi>

                  <hi>VII. Againſt this we have a maine objection,</hi>
pag. 292, 293. That while the Hebrew language
was the vulgar tongue of that Nation, and was
ſpoken by every one uniformaly every where, it had
been poſſibly upon a ſuppoſition that there were no
points, that men without infallible guidance &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
might affix notes and figures which might
with ſome exactneſs anſwer the common pronunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of that language, and ſo conſequently exhibit
the true &amp; proper ſence and meaning of the words
themſelves. But when there had beene an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption
of 1000 years in the vulgar uſe of that
language, and being preſerved onely pure in our
books, to ſuppoſe that the true and exact pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
of every letter, tittle and ſyllable was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
alive by orall Tradition, not written any
where, nor commonly ſpoken, is to build Caſtles in
the ayre—<hi>After he ſaith,</hi> that the reliefe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient,
to ſay the <hi>Maſorites</hi> affixed not the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:115995:110"/>
preſent <hi>punctation</hi> arbitrarily, but according to
the tradition they had received. What weight is
to be laid upon ſuch a tradition for neere 1000.
yeares (above, according to <hi>Morinus)</hi> is eaſie to be
imagined? Nor let men pleaſe themſelves with
the pretended facility of learning the Hebrew
Language without points and accents, and not
onely the Language, but the true and proper read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and diſtinction of the Bible, let the points &amp;
accents be wholly removed, and the reſtraint and
diſtinction of the words as now pointed, and then
turne in the drove of the learned Criticks of this
age upon the noted Conſonants, and we ſhall quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſee what wofull worke, yea havock of the ſacred
Truth will be made among them, were they ſhut up
in ſeverall Cells, I ſhould hardly expect that har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
and agreement among them, which is fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
reported to have been among the LXX. in
the like caſe.</p>
               <p>VIII. To this we anſwer. 1. That though
the Language ceaſed to be <hi>Vulgar</hi> for 1000.
yeares, yet there was ſtill a ſucceſſion of <hi>Prieſts</hi>
and <hi>Scribes</hi> and other <hi>learned men,</hi> who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
the knowledge of the <hi>Language,</hi> and the
true <hi>reading</hi> and <hi>pronunciation</hi> of the <hi>Text,</hi>
and do to this day, with whom the <hi>Language</hi>
was the ſame as it was when the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſpoke it, and their ſtudy and profeſſion was
to write out <hi>copies</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and likewiſe to
<hi>read</hi> and <hi>expound</hi> it, or to <hi>teach</hi> the reading
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:115995:110"/>
and true pronnnciation of it to others, which
they did <hi>ſucceſſively</hi> from age to age (as we ſee
in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> which have a long time
ceaſed to be <hi>vulgar,</hi> and yet the knowledge of
the tongues, and the true reading and pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
is the ſame among learned men, as it was
when they were vulgar.) This was a great part
of the <hi>Jewiſh learning,</hi> the true reading of the
Text; and they who were moſt accurate and
exact therein, were honoured moſt among them,
and had their <hi>Schools,</hi> and their <hi>Schollars,</hi> and
<hi>Diſciples,</hi> whom they inſtructed from time to
time, till at length in regard of their many <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions</hi>
and <hi>baniſhments,</hi> that the true reading
might not be loſt with the <hi>language,</hi> they began
to affix <hi>points</hi> to the <hi>Text,</hi> as well to facilitate
the reading, as to preſerve it the better from
any alteration or change. And therefore
it was all one to them who ſtill preſerved the
true reading and ſence of the Scripture to <hi>point</hi>
and <hi>accent</hi> it as it was, whilſt the <hi>common people</hi>
ſpake and underſtood it as well as they; and
therefore upon this <hi>conceſſion,</hi> that whilſt the
Language was <hi>vulgar,</hi> the <hi>points</hi> and <hi>accents</hi>
might have been affixed with <hi>certainty,</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
undeniably, that even in the time of the
<hi>Tiberian Maſorites,</hi> the <hi>Rabbins</hi> and <hi>learned
men</hi> among the <hi>Jewes</hi> might <hi>point</hi> the <hi>Bible</hi> as
well as their Predeceſſors might have done
whilſt the <hi>Language</hi> was <hi>common.</hi> This is a
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:115995:111"/>
cleer truth to any common underſtanding, and
not <hi>to build Caſtles in the ayre.</hi> 2. The true
reading was not continued by <hi>orall</hi> or <hi>unwritten
Tradition</hi> after the tongue ceaſed to be <hi>vulgar,</hi>
but by the <hi>Written Text,</hi> which was alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<hi>entire</hi> among them; and the reading de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
not upon <hi>Tradition</hi> otherwiſe then the
reading of all Books in other <hi>Languages,</hi> which
depends upon the <hi>orall inſtruction</hi> of <hi>Maſters</hi>
and <hi>Teachers,</hi> without which continued from
hand to hand, how could any know that ſuch a
letter or character ſtands for ſuch a ſound, or
that ſuch a word hath ſuch a <hi>ſignification.</hi> The
<hi>Samaritane Pentateuch, Chaldean Paraphraſe</hi> of
the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> and the <hi>Syriack
Tranſlation</hi> of the <hi>Bible,</hi> continued above a
thouſand years before they were pointed (and
the <hi>Samaritan</hi> is not yet pointed, as is certainly
known &amp; confeſt by all) w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſhews plainly how
the <hi>Hebr. Text</hi> might be continued, and the true
reading preſerved without <hi>pointing,</hi> unleſs our
Author can ſhew any difference as to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
between the Languages: For they have the
ſame <hi>letters,</hi> the ſame <hi>vowels, Aleph, Vau, Jod,</hi> with
the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and the reading in every reſpect
ſubject to as much <hi>ambiguity</hi> and <hi>uncertainty</hi> as
is pretented to be in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> unpointed.
And that the true reading might be preſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
a thouſand yeares is not againſt all reaſon,
but very reaſonable to ſuppoſe, ſince we ſee the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:115995:111"/>

                  </gap>ame done in the <hi>Samaritane, Syriack,</hi> and
<hi>Chaldee</hi> for a longer time, and the ſame may be
ſaid of the <hi>Arabick,</hi> though not for ſo long a
time after the <hi>Alcoran</hi> was written.</p>
               <p>IX. 3. The certain <hi>reading</hi> of the <hi>Text</hi> by
diligent practice and uſe may be attained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>points,</hi> though with <hi>more difficulty</hi> then if
it were pointed, as hath been heretofore ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Martinius, Capellus</hi> and others. One
that's wholly ignorant of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue,
having ſome <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> as the LXX. or <hi>vulgar
Latine,</hi> may by labour and induſtry, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the <hi>Tranſlation</hi> with the <hi>Text,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the <hi>Antecedents</hi> and <hi>Conſequents,</hi> find
out the <hi>ſignification</hi> of each word by it ſelfe,
and the proper ſence and meaning in connexion
with others, and may by degrees find out where
the <hi>Tranſlator</hi> varied from the <hi>Text,</hi> and where
he was miſtaken. Thus among others <hi>Clenard</hi>
learned the <hi>Arabick</hi> without any Mr. or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter,
when that Language was ſcarce known in
<hi>Europe,</hi> by the <hi>Nubienſe Pſalter,</hi> where the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabick</hi>
is without any <hi>pointed vowels,</hi> by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
it with other <hi>Tranſlations</hi> in that <hi>Pſalter.</hi>
And ſo <hi>Erpenius,</hi> the great Writer of the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi>
in theſe <hi>parts,</hi> profeſſes of himſelfe, that
<hi>proprio marte,</hi> he firſt got the knowledge of the
<hi>Arabick</hi> tongue without any Teacher, out of
<hi>Arab. books</hi> not pointed, ſuch as the <hi>Arabick
Goſpells</hi> printed at <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Nubienſe Pſalter,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:115995:112"/>
Avicen,</hi> and other Authors; and if they were
done in the <hi>Arab.</hi> I know no reaſon why it may
not be done in the <hi>Hebrew;</hi> In the <hi>Chaldee</hi> and
<hi>Syriack</hi> (which ſeem to be <hi>dialects</hi> of the <hi>Heb.)</hi>
the ſame was done before <hi>points</hi> for them were
deviſed. <hi>Elias Lev. Galatinus, Scaliger,</hi> and
others teſtifie of their knowledge, that children
are taught to read <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Turkiſh</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> books without <hi>points,</hi> and
that they have ſeen them read very readily. It's
true, it is more difficulty to read without <hi>points<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
but yet <hi>attainable;</hi> for our Author is much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
when he ſayes that men may pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with a pretended <hi>facility</hi> of reading the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> without <hi>points,</hi> I know none that thinks
it ſo very eaſie: Nay, it is freely acknowledged
that it was with more <hi>difficulty</hi> attained before
the <hi>points</hi> were deviſed, and thereupon the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of true and diſtinct reading was accounted
no ordinary matter among the <hi>Rabbines,</hi> who
counted it a great part of their learning: Yet
the analogy of Grammar being agreed upon,
and known, it is not difficult for one that is but
reaſonably skilled in the Language (eſpecially
with the helpe of a Tranſlation or the like) to
read without points. Now the Analogy of
Grammar was always the ſame, or elſe not only
the figures of the points, but the ſounds alſo are
of a late invention. And therefore I doubt not
but that if <hi>points</hi> and <hi>accents</hi> were taken away;
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:115995:112"/>
yet by the helpe of ſome <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> and by
diligent <hi>care</hi> and <hi>ſtudy</hi> one might as well attaine
to the true reading of the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as <hi>Clenard</hi>
and <hi>Erpenius</hi> did of the <hi>Arabick:</hi> And that if
diverſe did follow the ſame ſtudy upon the ſame
<hi>Text,</hi> their <hi>harmony</hi> and <hi>agreement</hi> would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
the <hi>poſſibility,</hi> and would be better in
both the <hi>reading</hi> and <hi>ſence</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
then is to be found among ſome <hi>congregations</hi> at
this day, whoſe <hi>Harmony</hi> in expounding the
Scripture, is little better then that of the <hi>build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
of <hi>Babel,</hi> when their Tongues were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</p>
               <p>X. Thirdly, it is to be obſerved, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the reading of divers words <hi>unpointed,</hi>
conſidered by themſelves, might be <hi>dubious</hi> and
ſubject to <hi>diverſe readings,</hi> yet this <hi>ambiguity</hi>
is taken away by the <hi>antecedents</hi> &amp; <hi>conſequents,</hi>
ſo that in the <hi>Context,</hi> as they are parts of a
ſentence, the reading which is in it ſelfe ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous,
is determined to one ſence and meaning;
This is ſhewed at large in <hi>Proleg. 13. Sect. 50,
51.</hi> where an inſtance is given <hi>Sect.</hi> 51. out of
<hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 15. where the words unpointed are
<hi>ambiguous,</hi> and capable of diverſe ſences taken
ſeverally: but in the <hi>Context</hi> all <hi>ambiguity</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away; and this is proved againſt <hi>Morinus</hi>
and other <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> with whom our Author
ſeems to joyne hands, who from the <hi>ambiguity</hi>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:115995:113"/>
of ſome words <hi>unpointed</hi> would prove the Text
to be <hi>ambiguous;</hi> He inſtances in <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which
unpointed is capable of 8. ſignifications, which is
fully anſwered, <hi>Proleg.</hi> 87. Sect. 24. But if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the <hi>antecedents</hi> and <hi>conſequents,</hi>
ſome words doe ſtill remain doubtfull, as it is
in the <hi>Greek,</hi> and in <hi>all languages,</hi> yet the <hi>uſe</hi>
and <hi>cuſtome</hi> received in the <hi>Church</hi> takes away
all further <hi>ambiguity.</hi> The moſt of thoſe that
ſtand for the <hi>antiquity</hi> of the points, aſcribe the
firſt beginning of them to <hi>Eſdras,</hi> as <hi>Buxtorf</hi>
and others. Now if the <hi>Text</hi> might be read
<hi>certainly,</hi> and without <hi>ambiguity,</hi> though
without <hi>points,</hi> from the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras,</hi>
why might it not likewiſe be continued
and preſerved as well after <hi>Eſdras</hi> his time as it
was before? Experience, as I have ſaid, ſhewes
it in other Tongues, as the <hi>Chaldee, Syriack,
Arabick,</hi> &amp;c. which had no <hi>points</hi> at firſt, yet
were read without <hi>ambiguity.</hi> The <hi>Talmuds,</hi>
and other <hi>Rabbinicall</hi> Writings are daily read
both by <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> without <hi>points.
Punctation</hi> facilitates the reading. He that
underſtands not the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> may read it with
<hi>points;</hi> he that is excerciſed in the Tongue may
read it without them. There is no colour
why the <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſe,</hi> the <hi>Syriack
Bible,</hi> the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> might be read, and
the true ſence certainly knowne before they
were pointed, and why the <hi>Hebrew Text</hi>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:115995:113"/>
cannot, but muſt be ſubject to ſuch <hi>uncertainty.</hi>
The <hi>New Teſtament</hi> was not at firſt written
with <hi>accents, notes of aſpiration, diſtinction,</hi> by
<hi>Comma</hi> &amp; <hi>Colon,</hi> &amp;c. as is ſhewed, <hi>Proleg. 3. Sect.

                  </gap> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi>
as the <hi>Authors</hi> of that <hi>Edition</hi> in one of their
<hi>Prefaces</hi> affirm: and it is known that ſome
<hi>Greek</hi> words <hi>unaccented,</hi> are doubtfull, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of diverſe ſences, and that the <hi>diſtinctions</hi>
do ſometimes alter the ſence, and yet none of
the <hi>Ancients</hi> accuſe the <hi>Greek Text</hi> of <hi>ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
but the reading was <hi>certain,</hi> and ſo continued,
till <hi>accents</hi> and <hi>diſtinctions</hi> were invented. If
the want of theſe did not hinder the <hi>certainty</hi> of
the <hi>New Testament,</hi> why ſhould the want of
the <hi>points</hi> hinder the <hi>certainty</hi> of the <hi>Old?</hi>

ſome Learned <hi>Jews,</hi> for the help of thoſe who

they were, how many, one or more, in what

or <hi>Logicall,</hi> yet it had its riſe from a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Theologicall:</hi> For when at the beginning of
the <hi>reformation,</hi> divers queſtions aroſe about
the <hi>Scripture</hi> and the <hi>Church;</hi> The <hi>Romaniſts</hi>
obſerving that the <hi>punctation</hi> of the <hi>Hebrew
Text</hi> was an invention of the <hi>Maſorites,</hi> they
thereupon inferred, that the <hi>Text</hi> without the
<hi>points</hi> might be taken in divers ſences, and that
none was tyed to the reading of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi>
and therefore concluded, that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is
<hi>ambiguous</hi> and <hi>doubtfull</hi> without the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and teſtimony of the <hi>Church,</hi> ſo that all
muſt flie to the <hi>authority</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon her for the true <hi>ſence</hi> and <hi>meaning</hi> of
the <hi>Scripture.</hi> On the other ſide, ſome <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi>
fearing that ſome advantage might be
given to the <hi>Romaniſt</hi> by this <hi>Conceſſion,</hi> and not
conſidering how the <hi>certainty</hi> of the <hi>Scripture</hi>
might well be maintained, though the <hi>Text</hi> were
<hi>pointed,</hi> in ſtead of denying the <hi>Conſequence,</hi>
which they might well have done, thought ſit
rather to deny the <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> and to maintain,
that the <hi>points</hi> were of <hi>Divine Original,</hi> whereby
they involved themſelves in extreme <hi>labyrinths,</hi>
engaging themſelves in defence of that which
might be eaſily proved to be falſe, and thereby
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:115995:115"/>
wronged the cauſe which they ſeemed to defend.
Others therefore of more <hi>learning</hi> &amp; <hi>judgment,</hi>
knowing that this <hi>Poſition</hi> of <hi>the Divine original</hi>
of the <hi>points</hi> could not be made good; and that
the <hi>Truth</hi> needed not the Patronage of an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth,</hi>
would not engage themſelves therein,
but granted it to be true, that the <hi>points</hi> were
invented by the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> yet denyed the <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi>
maintaining, notwithſtanding, that the
reading and ſence of the <hi>Text</hi> might be <hi>certain</hi>
without <hi>punctation,</hi> and that therefore the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi>

XIII. Amongſt thoſe who undertook to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
the <hi>Divine Originall</hi> of the <hi>points,</hi> the chief
was <hi>Buxtorf.</hi> the Father, a man without doubt
of very great skill in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as any in his
time and one whoſe labours conduced much to
the knowledge of that <hi>Tongue.</hi> This man in his
<hi>Hebrew Grammar, Edit.</hi> 1. brought divers ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to prove his opinion, and ſaid more for
it then any others had done before him, whoſe
authority, grounded upon his great skill in the
<hi>Hebrew,</hi> drew divers, who wanted either leiſure
or ability, to weigh all the reaſons on both ſides,
to imbrace his opinion, and to take it for
granted, and the rather, becauſe it ſeemed to
make more againſt the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> then the other.
Afterwards, in the enſuing <hi>Editions</hi> of his <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi>
this Tract about the <hi>points</hi> was left out,
whereupon it was conceived by divers, that he
had changed his <hi>judgement:</hi> and it appears, that
divers men of great Learning did much oppoſe
his opinion, as <hi>Scaliger, Epiſt.</hi> 243. and others,
ſo that it might well be thought he began
to ſtagger in it, and therefore thought fit to
forbear the further publiſhing of it, till he had
better conſidered of the whole matter. After
this, <hi>Lud. Capellus, Hebrew Profeſſor</hi> at <hi>Saumer,</hi>
a man of great Learning and worth, as his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
ſpeak him, publiſhed his <hi>Arcanum puncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis
revelatum,</hi> which was ſet out by <hi>Erpenius</hi>
at <hi>Leyden, an.</hi> 1624. Wherein he largely handles
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:115995:116"/>
the whole <hi>Controverſie,</hi> anſwered all <hi>Buxtorfs</hi>
arguments to the full, and brought ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
reaſons to the contrary, that few who
read this Book without prejudice, but ſubſcribed
to his opinion; as <hi>Erpenius, Ger. Voſſius, Rivet.
Sixt. Amama, Spanhemius, Feſtus Hommius, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terius,</hi>
&amp;c. as appears by ſome of their <hi>Epiſtles,</hi>
Printed in his <hi>Defenſio Criticae;</hi> yea, divers that
formerly were ſtrongly againſt his Opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
convinced by evidence in his reaſons, joyned
with them, as Mr. <hi>Eyres,</hi> late Prebend of <hi>Ely,</hi>
a man of great skill in this kinde of <hi>Learning,
Arnold. Bootius,</hi> a man of great knowledge in
the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and a violent oppoſer of <hi>Capellus</hi>
his <hi>Critica,</hi> yea, it was conceived by ſome, that
<hi>Buxtorf</hi> himſelf was wavering in his opinion,
but that he was loth to retract what he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
in Print affirmed. After his deceaſe, his
Son, <hi>D. Buxtorf,</hi> who ſucceded his Father in the
place of <hi>Hebrew Profeſſor</hi> at <hi>Baſil,</hi> out of piety
to his Father, as is by himſelf in his <hi>Vindic.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly
confeſſed, undertook to anſwer <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellus,</hi>
(who had formery oppoſed and confuted
his opinion about the ancient <hi>Hebrew letters)</hi>
though not without more <hi>ſharpneſſe</hi> and <hi>animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi>
then could have been wiſhed to have been
between <hi>Divines,</hi> and thoſe both <hi>Proteſtants,</hi>
which he hath done in a <hi>full Volume,</hi> wherein
what he hath performed, I leave to every mans
judgement; for my own part, (though he be
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:115995:117"/>
my worthy and much honoured friend, with
whom I have for divers years had friendly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe
by Letters, (notwithſtanding our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of judgement in this and other matters)
yet I cannot aſſent to his opinion; nor do I
finde upon peruſall of his Book, that he hath
clearly anſwered <hi>Capellus</hi> his Arguments, but
that they ſtand firm and unſhaken, nor brought
any argument for his opinion, which is not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
by <hi>Capellus,</hi> though I believe he hath
ſaid as much out of his <hi>Hebrew Learning,</hi>
(wherein I think he hath not many fellows this
day living) as poſſibly can be alledged. I know
that there are ſome <hi>Learned men</hi> of good note,
who partly drawn by <hi>Buxtorfs</hi> authority, and
partly out of fear, leſt the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> ſhould
take advantage by this conceſſion, and partly
by their too much adhering to <hi>Rabbinicall
Tenets,</hi> and parly, becauſe they never <hi>ſeriouſly</hi>
ſtudied the <hi>Controverſie,</hi> nor weighed the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of both ſides in the even ballance of an
unbyaſſed judgement, but taking things upon
truſt, without examining the grounds, as the
generality of men do in all kinde of <hi>Learning,</hi>
have followed <hi>Buxtorfs</hi> opinion; yet upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
it will be found that the moſt of thoſe
of greateſt judgement, both in <hi>Divinity</hi> and
<hi>Eaſtern Learning</hi> which this age hath produced,
are of contrary opinion: And I muſt profeſſe,
that having occaſion by reaſon of this <hi>Work</hi>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:115995:117"/>
of the <hi>Bible,</hi> to be acquainted, or to keep cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
with thoſe that are moſt <hi>eminent</hi> in
this <hi>Learning,</hi> both at home and abroad, I
ſcarce know of any (a few excepted) who are
verſed more then ordinary in theſe matters that
are not of the ſame judgement, which I have
aſſerted in the <hi>Prolegomena.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XIV. This is the true</hi> hiſtory <hi>of the riſe &amp;</hi> Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>of this controverſy, which though it be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the</hi> Prolegomena, <hi>yet our Author takes
no notice of, but tells us another</hi> ſtory <hi>of it, which
we ſhall briefly conſider. He tells us</hi> p. 248. <hi>and
Epiſt. p.</hi> 15. 16. That Elias Levita, the moſt
learned of the Jews of that age, was acquainted
with many of the firſt Reformers, and lived par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
with <hi>P. Phagius.</hi> That in his <hi>Maſora
Hammat.</hi> he broched an opinion not much heard
of before, at leaſt not at all received among the
Jews, nor for ought that yet appears once mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by Chriſtians before, namely that the points or
vowels, and accents, were invented by ſome critical
Jews or Maſorites living at <hi>Tiberias</hi> about five
or ſix hundred years after Chriſt, and that no doubt
the mans aim was to reduce the world of Chriſtians
to a dependance upon the ancient Rabbins for the
whole ſenſe of Scripture. <hi>Hinc prima mali
labes,</hi> Here lies the firſt breach in this matter.
This fraud being not diſcovered, and this opinion
being broched and confirmed by the great and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
onely Maſter of that Language, of that Age,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:115995:118"/>
ſome even of the firſt Reformers embraced this fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
Perhaps <hi>Zuinglius</hi> had ſpoken to it before. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a while the poyſon of this error beginning to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
the Papiſts waiting at the mouth of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
like the ſervants of <hi>Benhadad</hi> on <hi>Ahab</hi> to
catch at every word that might fall from them to
their advantage, began to make uſe of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XV. In this Diſcourſe, as there are ſome
things true, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Elias</hi> was one of the
moſt <hi>learned</hi> Jews of his age, That he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with <hi>Phagius,</hi> That he maintained the
<hi>Tiberian Maſorites</hi> to have been the Authors
of the points, and proved the ſame by diverſe
arguments, That divers of the firſt <hi>Reformers</hi>
were of the ſame opinion with him, ſo for all
the reſt, as it wants all probability of truth, ſo
it may be as eaſily rejected, as it is affirmed.</p>
               <p>XVI. For that <hi>Elias Lev.</hi> was the firſt that held
that opinion, and that it was not mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by any <hi>Christians</hi> for any thing that yet
appears is far from truth, when as there were
ſundry <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Writers (ſome of which he
might have read named <hi>Proleg. 3. Lect. 38.)</hi> who
lived long before <hi>Elias,</hi> ſome 50. ſome 100. ſome
300 years before his name was heard of, who
held the ſame opinion of the points, as <hi>Elias</hi> did,
as <hi>Angelus Politianus, Joh. Picus Mirandula,</hi>
that miracle of his time, <hi>Lyra, Paulus Burgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi>
beſides, <hi>Raimundus,</hi> the Author of <hi>Pugio fidei,</hi>
who lived about 1200 years after <hi>Chriſt. Politian</hi>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:115995:118"/>
thus writes of <hi>Pic. Mirand. Miſcell. cap. 14. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitiae
ſunt iſtae notae, quibus nunc pro vocalibus
utuntur Hebraei, ut idem &amp; comperit, &amp; oſtendit,
Joh. Picus Mirandulanus, unus omnium pror<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus

&amp; admirando, quo Pſalmos à</hi> LXX <hi>verſos, iſto
notarum praecipue argumento, docet Hebraicae ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritati
respondere.</hi> Beſides there lived divers in
the ſame time with <hi>Elias,</hi> who knew nothing
of him, or ſcarce had heard of him, as <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
Veltwicus, Zuinglius, Pellican, Luther,</hi> and
after him many learned men, who held the ſame
opinion, not moved by <hi>Elias</hi> his arguments or
authority, but convinced by the evidence of the
things, as <hi>Calvin, Mercer, Maſius, Boderianus,
Joſ. Scaliger, Caſaubon, Ar. Montanus, Druſius,
&amp;c.</hi> ſo that this is a <hi>vain brag,</hi> that no <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
held the ſame opinion with <hi>Elias</hi> before his
time. Let our Adverſary name ſo many learned
men before <hi>Elias,</hi> or before the <hi>Reformation,</hi>
that held the points to be of <hi>Divine Originall.</hi>
I doubt it would be hard for him to name any
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Writer that did abſolutely affirm the
ſame before that time.</p>
               <p>XVII. Nor was <hi>Elias</hi> the only man among the
<hi>Jews</hi> that held this opinion; for beſides the <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
acknowledgement</hi> of the <hi>whole Nation,</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their practice in their <hi>Synagogues,</hi> uſing

                  </gap> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

confeſſe unpointed, and the Teſtimony
drawn from the ancient <hi>Cabbaliſts,</hi> and <hi>Talmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts,</hi>
who draw none of their <hi>Myſticall Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions</hi>
from any of the <hi>points</hi> or <hi>accents,</hi> which
without doubt they would have done, if they
had then been in uſe, as well as they do from
the <hi>letters,</hi> beſides theſe, ſome of the chief <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins</hi>
before <hi>Elias</hi> have held the ſame, as is elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
ſhewed out of <hi>Kimchi, Cozri, Ab. Ezra,
Jehuda, Chiug.</hi> and others, who expreſly affirm
that the whole punctation was the work of the
<hi>Tiberian Maſorites</hi> and upon any doubt in
punctation fly to them, and give this reaſon of
their Readings, that the <hi>Tiberian Maſorites</hi> did
ſo point and read it.</p>
               <p>XVIII. So that <hi>Elias</hi> broched this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
aiming hereby to reduce the world of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
to a dependence on the <hi>ancient Rabbins,</hi> is
a meer <hi>winter ſtory</hi> without any ground or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
For <hi>Elias</hi> held the points to be part of
the <hi>orall Law,</hi> delivered on <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> and
continued by <hi>Tradition,</hi> till the points were
written and affixed to the <hi>Text</hi> by the <hi>Maſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites:</hi>
and therefore our Author obſerves elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
p. 250. <hi>That Elias tyed all as ſtrictly to
the Reading by points, as if they had been done by</hi>
Ezra. <hi>Elias</hi> therefore did not hold the Reading
and ſence of the Scripture, or the <hi>matter</hi> of
the <hi>Punctation</hi> to depend upon the <hi>Rabbins,</hi>
but onely the preſent <hi>forms</hi> and <hi>figures,</hi> and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:115995:119"/>
how could he imagine to draw <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to a
belief of that which he did not believe himſelf,
or to a <hi>dependence</hi> upon the <hi>Rabbins</hi> for the
whole ſence of the Scripture which himſelf did
not hold? And nothing more ſhews the vanity of
this fancy, then that thoſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that held
the ſame <hi>opinion</hi> with <hi>Elias,</hi> do utterly deny that
they depend upon the <hi>Rabbins</hi> ancient or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
for the ſence of the Scripture. <hi>Luther</hi> was
far from this, who as our Author cites him
within a few lines writes, that the <hi>Jews</hi> had <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted</hi>
the <hi>Bible</hi> by their <hi>points</hi> and <hi>diſtinctions,</hi>
and <hi>Calvin</hi> ſhews how little he eſteemed the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> on <hi>Zach.</hi> 11. 7. Let him
name any place, or one word out of <hi>Elias,</hi> or
any other writer, <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> that inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
in the leaſt that he had any ſuch aim, or
name one <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Writer, <hi>Romaniſt</hi> or <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi>
of this opinion, that profeſt to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Rabbins</hi> for the true ſence and Reading
of the <hi>Scripture.</hi> As groundleſſe is that which
follows, that this fraud of <hi>Elias</hi> was not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by the firſt <hi>Reformers,</hi> but that they were
unawares drawn to embrace his fancy: as though
thoſe wiſe and learned men were ſuch <hi>children</hi>
and <hi>Ideots,</hi> as not to diſcern the conſequence of
this opinion, or of ſuch weak judgements, as
to be led by the authority of a <hi>Jewiſh Rabbin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIX. It remains therefore, that the true
<hi>Originall</hi> of this <hi>Queſtion</hi> was, as I have ſhewed,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:115995:120"/>
the controverſie ariſing in the beginning of the
<hi>Reformation</hi> about the <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>certainty</hi> of
the <hi>Scripture,</hi> in reference to the <hi>Church:</hi> and
hence it was that this Queſtion about the <hi>points</hi>
was not ventilated before the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and
that ſo few make any mention of it, becauſe
the Queſtions about the <hi>Scripture</hi> and the
<hi>Church</hi> were not then raiſed: And that which
begun the quarrel doth ſtill continue it: ſome
out of fear, leſt they ſhould yield any thing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantagious
to the cauſe they maintain, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the points to be of <hi>Divine Originall,</hi>
and among thoſe ſome imbracing that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
not becauſe they knew it to be true,
but becauſe they conceive it makes more
for our cauſe againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> amongſt
which I may juſtly reckon our <hi>Adverſary,</hi>
who Epiſtol. pag. 18. is offended at Doctor
<hi>Prideaux, becauſe though he took notice of the
advantage the Papiſts make of that opinion
of the novelty of points, and of the danger of it,
yet which ſeems moſt admirable, himſelf falls in
with them, and maintains the ſame opinion:</hi> as if
we muſt meaſure the truth of Doctrine, not by
<hi>evidence</hi> of reaſon, but by the <hi>advantage</hi> it
brings to our cauſe; or muſt affirm what we
know to be falſe, becauſe it makes againſt the
<hi>Papiſts.</hi> Others therefore who ſee how <hi>ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe</hi>
thoſe <hi>fears</hi> are, and knowing that the truth
muſt not be denied, though ſome pervert it
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:115995:120"/>
to a wrong end, grant what they ſee cannot be
denied about the <hi>Originall</hi> of the <hi>points,</hi> yet
maintain the ſame <hi>Concluſion</hi> about the <hi>certainty</hi>
and <hi>authority</hi> of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> upon better and
more ſolid grounds, and ſo doth Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi>
in that <hi>Lecture,</hi> where he maintains the <hi>certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
and <hi>authority</hi> of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and ſo yields
nothing to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> though he grants the
<hi>points</hi> to be the invention of the <hi>Maſorites.</hi>

               <p>I. THis <hi>Queſtion</hi> concerning the <hi>Points</hi> is
handled by our Adverſary chiefly, Chap.
4. and 5. of the <hi>Conſiderations,</hi> though alſo by
the by, in ſome other places he hath ſome paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

                  </gap>o which I muſt remit the Reader, I ſhall onely
reply to what he anſwers to the Arguments in
the <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> and briefly examine what he
pretends to be added by himſelf <hi>de novo,</hi> to prove
this <hi>Rabbinicall</hi> fancy. Firſt, let us ſee how
he infringes the <hi>Arguments</hi> in the <hi>Prolegomena,</hi>
wherein I muſt needs ſay, he deals as in the reſt
of his Diſcourſe <hi>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ima fide,</hi> and is far from that
<hi>candor</hi> &amp; <hi>truth</hi> which he profeſſes: for he leaves
out diverſe of the <hi>chief</hi> Arguments, to which
he could give no colourable anſwer, and for the
reſt, he either propounds them by halfs, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
out that wherein the force of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
chiefly conſiſts, or perverts the ſence, and
ſpoils them in his rehearſing of them, ſo
that I may ſay of them, as the Poet did of his

               </q>
               <p>The Arguments are nine which he pretends to
confute; but by his relating them, he makes them
his own; for as he delivers them, I own them
not. I ſhall therefore deſire the <hi>Reader</hi> to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend
his judgement till he have compared them
as they are laid down in the <hi>Conſiderations,</hi> and
as they are delivered in the <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> and
then to judge as he ſhall ſee cauſe: I ſhall at

wholly omitted, and then give a taſte of his <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did

                  <hi>Eyres,</hi>
late Prebend of <hi>Ely,</hi> &amp;c. This Argument,
though inartificiall, yet of great weight, our
<hi>Author</hi> touches not, becauſe he would have it
believed that the Opinion is <hi>ſingular,</hi> and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by a <hi>few,</hi> and that <hi>the generality of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men in theſe matters, are not infected</hi> (as he
ſaith) <hi>with this leaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. As he leaves out the firſt, ſo he wholly
omits the laſt, and yet he would have you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that he propounds and anſwers all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
in the <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> p. 260. Of what
weight it is, and whether it admits any anſwer,
let the <hi>Reader</hi> judge. It is laid down, <hi>Sect.</hi> 48.
And it is taken from the other <hi>Oriental Tongues,</hi>
which have greateſt affinity with the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as
the <hi>Arabick, Chaldee, Syriack, Samaritane,</hi> &amp;c.
none of which at firſt had <hi>points,</hi> nor hath the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:115995:123"/>
                  <hi>Samaritane</hi> any yet. The <hi>Alcoran</hi> was at firſt
written without <hi>points,</hi> as is proved by <hi>Golius,</hi>
and others the chief Profeſſors of that <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</hi>
The like is confeſſed of the <hi>Syriack,
Chaldee Paraphraſe,</hi> and is ſo clear for the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritane,</hi>
that ſcarce any but our <hi>Author</hi> will affirm
the contrary. The <hi>Perſians</hi> have ſcarce got the
uſe of <hi>points</hi> as yet, though ſome of late have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to make rules of <hi>punctation</hi> for that <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</hi>
In all theſe <hi>Languages</hi> they have the ſame
<hi>letters</hi> which of old ſtood for <hi>vowels</hi> in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew;</hi>
nor have they in the <hi>Arabick,</hi> that copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Language,</hi> ſince the invention of <hi>points,</hi> any
more then three, which ſerve for all <hi>vowels. Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,
Damma,</hi> and <hi>Keſra,</hi> by which, with a few
<hi>generall rules,</hi> and <hi>uſe,</hi> they read diſtinctly, and
pronounce all the five <hi>vowels.</hi> By thoſe three
<hi>letters</hi> which anſwer to <hi>Aleph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Jod,</hi> and <hi>Vau,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any points were uſed in any of the <hi>Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
they could diſtinctly read and underſtand
their <hi>Tranſlations</hi> of the <hi>Bible,</hi> and their other
books, and attain the ſence without <hi>ambiguity</hi>
and <hi>uncertainty;</hi> and none ever doubted but
that the <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſe</hi> of <hi>Onkelus</hi> and
<hi>Jonathan,</hi> written about our <hi>Saviours</hi> time, the
ancient <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of the <hi>Syriack,</hi> written in
the firſt or ſecond <hi>Century</hi> after <hi>Chriſt;</hi> as alſo
the <hi>Alcoran</hi> among the <hi>Mahumetanes,</hi> were
read at firſt, as they are now, (though not with
ſo much facility) and yet it is certain that the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:115995:124"/>
                  <hi>points</hi> were added to them all after the <hi>invention</hi>
of the <hi>Hebrew points,</hi> yea, though <hi>points</hi> be
now added to them all, except the <hi>Samaritane,</hi>
yet neither that nor the <hi>Arabick</hi> or <hi>Syriack,</hi>
have yet any notes at all of <hi>accents;</hi> and yet
thoſe that are skilled in thoſe <hi>Languages,</hi> know
where the <hi>accent</hi> ought to be in every word and
ſyllable, though no note be <hi>affixed,</hi> as we ſee
in the <hi>Latine,</hi> and in all other <hi>Vulgar Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Engliſh, Dutch, French,</hi> &amp;c. And in the
<hi>Greek</hi> it is further ſhewed, <hi>Sect.</hi> 45. out of
ancient <hi>MSS.</hi> as alſo out of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi>

That <hi>New Teſtament</hi> of <hi>Beza</hi> in <hi>Cambridge
Library,</hi> that of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> and other old
<hi>MSS.</hi> are without <hi>accents,</hi> and the <hi>Authors</hi> of
the <hi>Complutenſe Edition</hi> give this reaſon why
they <hi>pointed</hi> the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> without <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents,</hi>
becauſe the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was ſo written:
yet we know how uſefull <hi>accents</hi> are to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
words of <hi>Ambiguous</hi> ſence, which differ
onely in the <hi>accents;</hi> From all which we infer,
that if the right reading and pronunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
might be attained and preſerved in thoſe
<hi>Tongues</hi> without any <hi>pointed vowels,</hi> and is now,
though a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> yet they have no <hi>accents,</hi> ſome of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:115995:124"/>
them, then the ſame might be done in the
<hi>Hebrew,</hi> by the help of the ſame Letters, <hi>Aleph,
Jod,</hi> and <hi>Vau,</hi> thoſe <hi>matres lectionis.</hi> I could not
yet finde in any of the Patrons of <hi>points</hi> any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
anſwer to this Argument; and if our
<hi>Author</hi> could have given any, I ſuppoſe he
would not have paſt it over without anſwer
more then the reſt.</p>
               <p>IV. He tells us out of <hi>Poſtellus,</hi> that in <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roms</hi>
time the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> had <hi>points,</hi> becauſe
he ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>That the Samaritane and Hebrew let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
differ only figuris &amp; apicibus,</hi> Prolegom, <hi>in
lib.</hi> Reg. But he might have alſo read in <hi>Poſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> had no <hi>points,</hi> though in his
dotage, when he was infatuated with <hi>Rabbinicall</hi>
and <hi>Cabaliſticall</hi> fancie, and ſell into divers <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticall</hi>
and <hi>Hereticall</hi> errors, among other
things, he began to make the <hi>points</hi> to be part of
the <hi>Oral Law</hi> delivered on <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> and
continued by <hi>Oral Tradition:</hi> and his proof out
of <hi>Hierom</hi> for the <hi>Samritane points,</hi> is as much
to the purpoſe as our <hi>Authors</hi> proof out of the
ſame <hi>Hierom</hi> for the <hi>Hebrew points,</hi> becauſe he
ſpeaks of <hi>vowels,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>vocalibus in medio per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raro
utuntur:</hi> when as it is as clear as the Sun (as
is already ſhewed) to any that reads <hi>Hieroms</hi>
words, and is ſo proved, <hi>Prolegom. 3. Sect.</hi> 49.
that by the <hi>Apices</hi> he means, <hi>Literarum ductus
&amp; ſummitates,</hi> as when he ſaith, that <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:115995:125"/>
by <hi>vowels</hi> he means <hi>Aleph, Vau,</hi> and <hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>od,</hi> which
he expreſly calls <hi>vowels,</hi> and ſaith they are not

the <hi>beginning</hi> and <hi>end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>V. We ſee what Arguments he wholly omits,
let us now ſee how he deals with the reſt, &amp; how
faithfully he propounds them. I will inſtance but
in one or two: <hi>Conſider.</hi> Chap. 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5.
pag. 267. he there propounds the Argument
urged, <hi>Prolegom. 3. Sect. 41. The conſtant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the</hi> Jews <hi>in preſerving in their Synagogue
one Book, which they almoſt adore, without points,

Now let us ſee how it is propunded in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legomena.

alſo all the evaſions and ſhifts uſed to avoid the

lies in this, not <hi>that the</hi> Jews <hi>uſe a book in the

fit for that uſe.</hi> Let any man of common reaſon
judge, whether the Argument be truly related
by him, &amp; whether there be not a vaſt difference
between that in the <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> and this which

of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and their <hi>ancient practice</hi> in

therefore the anſwer he gives, doth not at all
touch that wherein the force of the Argument

Here we ſee the Argument <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is, <hi>That diverſe
words without points were ambiguous, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of diverſe ſences, and that the ſame may be
read, as the Interpreters render them, if the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
were not pointed, whereas they are now read
in another ſence, as the Copies are now pointed,
there being no change at all in the letters, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the points.</hi> Now how doth our Adverſary
propound this Argument? <hi>p. 281. It is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pleaded, that the ancient Tranſlations, the</hi>
Greek, Chaldee, Syri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ck, <hi>do manifeſt that at
the time of their compoſing, the points were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.
And that becauſe it is evident in ſundry
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:115995:127"/>
places that they read otherwiſe, or the words with
other points (I mean as to the force and ſound,
not figure of them) then thoſe now affixed. Thus
he propounds it, and then anſwers with a ſcoffe,
That the differences would as well prove they had
other conſonants, that is, that in their Copies
they uſed, they had other letters and words then
ours, as other vowels.</hi> Who ſees not here a
plain and wilfull falſifying of the Argument?
for the Argument is not drawn from all places
where the <hi>Tranſlators</hi> read otherwiſe then is
now read in the <hi>Hebrew Copies,</hi> but onely from
ſuch places where the ſame word with the ſame
letters (being unpointed) might be read and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
both as they tranſlated it, and as it ſignifies
according to the preſent punctation, or that
the word conſiſting of the ſame <hi>letters</hi> being
without <hi>points</hi> was <hi>ambiguous,</hi> or capable of
two ſignifications, of which the one was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by the <hi>Tranſlator</hi> the other by the <hi>Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators.</hi>
Now our Author never mentions
that wherin the Argument conſiſts, that the
word being unpointed is <hi>ambiguous</hi> and <hi>capable
both of the ſignification</hi> given in the <hi>Tranſlation,</hi>
and of that which agrees to the modern <hi>puncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
when as if it had been pointed, the <hi>ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity</hi>
had been taken away, and they muſt have
read it as they are now read in the <hi>pointed Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles:</hi>
but tells us of words read with other <hi>points</hi>
differing from thoſe we have now, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:115995:127"/>
makes his pleaſant inference: That we
might as well prove by this, that they had <hi>other
letters</hi> and <hi>conſonants,</hi> as <hi>vowels</hi> and <hi>points;</hi> It is
true indeed, if the Argument had been ſuch as he
makes it, taken from all words wherein they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
from the preſent pointed Copies, but not
when onely the words unpointed agree with
their rendring it, by reaſon of the ambiguity
without points. <hi>Buxtorf</hi> confeſſes, this argument
ſeemed to be invincible, <hi>Achilleum,</hi> but as our
Adverſary propounds it, it is <hi>ſtramineum,</hi> and
meerely <hi>ridiculous;</hi> for it is well known and
granted often, that theſe <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that of the LXX. differ in many places,
where the reaſon cannot be given from the <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity</hi>
of the word deſtitute of points, but that
it is from other cauſes, of which we have ſpoken
before.</p>
               <p>VIII. I will not inſiſt upon the other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as that from the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> who never
had any pointed Copies, nor have to this day,
but by the help of theſe three letters <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> have
kept the true Reading of their books, by which
means they are now alſo read of others, which
is not only ſaid, but proved, though the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
anſwers it with a ſcoff, <hi>Pergula pictoris.</hi> That
of the <hi>ſilence</hi> of all the Ancients, <hi>Hier. Origen,
Euſebius, Epiphanius, Joſephus,</hi> all skilled in
<hi>Hebrew</hi> antiquities, who never mention the
name of any <hi>point</hi> or <hi>accent,</hi> though they had
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:115995:128"/>
often occaſion to mention them, as is proved by
inſtances in <hi>Hierom,</hi> to which no anſwer is given,
but a bare deniall of what is proved, <hi>viz. that
they had no occaſion.</hi> The <hi>ſilence</hi> of both the
<hi>Talmuds</hi> in all thoſe vaſt volumes, where there
is not one word or tittle of any <hi>pointed vowell
or accent,</hi> (as is acknowledged by <hi>Buxtorf</hi>
himſelf) though there was <hi>occaſion,</hi> yea a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
to have mentioned them in ſome places
which are there inſtanced in, if there had been
any then known, to which no anſwer is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but a bold generall deniall that they had
no <hi>occaſion.</hi> That before the age of the <hi>Tiberian
Maſorites,</hi> there is no mention of any points,
by any Writer, <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as is largely
ſhewed, and that the antiquity of thoſe books
where they are mentioned, as the book <hi>Zohar,</hi>
&amp;c. is acknowledged by <hi>Buxtorf</hi> to be forged,
and antedated a thouſand years, and ſo proved
by <hi>Scaliger</hi> and others. That the <hi>ancient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baliſts</hi>
draw all their <hi>Allegories</hi> and <hi>Mysteries</hi>
from the <hi>letters</hi> (as they are called) not one
from the <hi>points,</hi> which if they had been known
in their times, would have yielded them matter
enough, yea more then the <hi>letters,</hi> for their
<hi>myſticall Expoſitions,</hi> as we ſee in the <hi>later Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baliſts</hi>
which have been ſince the <hi>invention of
points</hi> (which argument alſo is quite omitted by
the Adverſary) that the <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Ketib</hi> which
are confeſt by all to be for the moſt part <hi>vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:115995:128"/>
Readings</hi> gathered out of <hi>ancient Hebrew Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,</hi>
are all about the <hi>letters</hi> only, not any about
the <hi>points,</hi> which yet if the <hi>points</hi> had then been
in uſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had been more ſubject to miſtakes of the
<hi>Scribes</hi> then the <hi>letters,</hi> and ſo more <hi>various
Readings</hi> might have been gathered out of them,
then from the difference of the <hi>letters,</hi> that in
the ſame <hi>Keries</hi> and <hi>Ketibs,</hi> the vowels or
points belonging to the <hi>Marginall</hi> word or the
<hi>Keri,</hi> are put under the word in the <hi>Text,</hi> or
the <hi>Ketib,</hi> to admoniſh the Reader, that the
word in the <hi>Margent</hi> muſt be read, and not the
word in the <hi>Text,</hi> and diverſe other the like
things, which were moſt abſurd to aſcribe to
the <hi>ſacred Pen-men,</hi> who if they had been the
Authors of the <hi>points,</hi> would have put the true
<hi>Reading,</hi> (which they could not be ignorant of)
into the <hi>Text,</hi> with its own proper <hi>points,</hi> and
not to have placed it in the <hi>Margent</hi> without
<hi>points,</hi> or have put the <hi>points</hi> under another
word to which they did not belong, with which
it cannot be read. Such things (of which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
are obſerved in the <hi>punctation)</hi> are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unworthy to be aſcribed to the ſpirit of
<hi>God.</hi> That the <hi>names</hi> of the <hi>points</hi> and <hi>accents</hi>
are all of a <hi>late Originall,</hi> all <hi>Chaldee,</hi> not any
<hi>Hebrew,</hi> to which nothing is anſwered, but
that the names were invented by the <hi>late
Grammarians.</hi> As if before that time they were
without <hi>names,</hi> or could be continued in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:115995:129"/>
uſe, for above a thouſand years without
names to diſtinguiſh them. That the <hi>number</hi>
and <hi>uſe</hi> of them all is <hi>uncertain,</hi> and not yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
upon among the <hi>Grammarians,</hi> diverſe of
them apparently <hi>ſuperfluous,</hi> and yet in this

in other <hi>languages.</hi> Theſe things are largely

which I do only here name for brevities ſake, yet

contrary to what is intended, then that
which is urged out of</hi> Aben Ezra <hi>in</hi> Ex. 25, 31.
<hi>Where he affirms that he ſaw ſome books examined
in all the letters and the whole punctation by the
wiſe men of Tiberias, namely to try whether it
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:115995:129"/>
were done exactly according to the pattern they
had.</hi> Here we ſee he addes that which makes the
words ſeem to contradict that they were
brought for, <hi>(namely whether it were done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the pattern they had)</hi> of which words
not one is in <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> nor in the <hi>Prolegome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
for the meaning of <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> is plain, that
they examined every word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> letter, and point,
whether all were rightly pointed according to
the <hi>true and common pronunciation</hi> or Reading,
which our Adverſary makes to be, according to
ſome <hi>former pointed</hi> Copy, which is utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to <hi>Aben Ezra's</hi> meaning and words, and
yet they might re-examine their <hi>own Copie,</hi> after
it was finiſhed, as we know it is uſuall for thoſe
that are carefull and exact in writing, to review
what they have written, that they may amend
ſuch errors and faults as have eſcaped them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they make it publick. If he may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thus to adde and detract and change what he
pleaſes, he may eaſily make any Argument
worth nothing, and to prove the contrary to
what it is brought. Thus he falſifies the words
of <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> and the Argument drawn from
them in the <hi>Prolegomena.</hi>

Prolegomena, <hi>where, whether</hi> Buxtorfs <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
be all anſwered, let the Reader judge.
Something more our Author pretends to adde,
which hath been omitted by others, p.</hi> 252. &amp;c.
<hi>The Argument though ſomewhat intricate and
obſcure, as he propounds it, ſeems to be this.</hi>
That all Grammars muſt be made after the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and gathered by obſervations out of the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
which are reduced to rules of art, and
what is anomalous or irregular is excepted from
the reſt, and that if the points and accents were
invented, and added to the Text, being no part of
the language, then there muſt be ſome generall
rules of art conſtituted and made before they could
be added to the Text, according to which they were
fixed and added, and ſo there muſt be ſome Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar
or art according to which they were contrived
and made. Now that this could not be, he proves
by two reaſons. 1. Becauſe there are ſo many
words anomalous, irregularly pointed, contrary
to the Analogy of Grammar, which they might
have made all regular to their own great eaſe, and
advantage of the language, facilitating the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it. 2. Becauſe the <hi>Maſorites,</hi> who cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
have reckoned up every word in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and the irregularity of every letter and
tittle, never mention any of thoſe Catholick rules,
by which they or their Maſters proceeded in the
fixing of theſe points, nor do any footſteps of that
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:115995:130"/>
art appear in the <hi>Maſora,</hi> or any learned Jew,
which was their rule or Canon in affixing the
points<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but all the Grammarians, collect their obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
and rules as they could by particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
out of the punctation <hi>already made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>X. This objection, at leaſt in part, was made
long ſince by <hi>Buxtorf</hi> the elder, and the anſwer
given long ago by <hi>Capellus</hi> in his <hi>Arcanum,</hi> l. 2.
c. 10, 11 19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and lately in the <hi>Prolegom. 3.
Sect.</hi> 54. For the firſt, about words <hi>anomalous,</hi> he
may find among other things, this anſwer given,
That they were ſo <hi>pointed</hi> by the <hi>Maſorites,

if they had obſerved, they would have <hi>pointed</hi> all
<hi>regularly,</hi> and that in ſuch a long Work, this
might eaſily happen, that ſome words might

and noted, conceiving that ſome great

                  </hi>

done by thoſe before them.</p>
               <p>XI. To the ſecond, There are generall <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar
Rules</hi> in every <hi>Tongue,</hi> and a particular
<hi>Grammar Analogie</hi> in each particular <hi>Tongue,</hi>
before it be reduced into <hi>Rules.</hi> Theſe, no doubt,
were conſidered by the <hi>Maſorites</hi> in their <hi>pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,</hi>
and accordingly they <hi>pointed</hi> the <hi>Text,</hi>
according to ſuch <hi>Rules</hi> for the reading and
pronunciation, as they were taught by their
<hi>Maſters,</hi> and invented the <hi>names</hi> and <hi>figures</hi> of
the <hi>vowels</hi> and <hi>accents,</hi> which they have left to
<hi>Poſterity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> though the <hi>later Grammarians</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
differ from the <hi>ancienter</hi> about the names, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:115995:131"/>
number, and uſe. The way and manner
how it is moſt like they proceeded, is excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſet down by <hi>Capell. Arcan.</hi> lib. 1. c. 17, 18.
Some generall <hi>Rules,</hi> which may be called <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall,</hi>
when they went about this Work, they
deviſed and agreed upon, which by <hi>ſucceeding
Grammarians,</hi> were perfected and reduced into
a body. And though it be generally thought
that no <hi>Hebrew Grammar</hi> was made above five
or ſix hundred years ago, yet <hi>Maimon,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of divers <hi>Grammarians</hi> that were before
him, mentions <hi>R. Saadias,</hi> who died about the
year of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 940. to be the firſt <hi>Gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>marian,</hi>
which was not long after the <hi>Maſorites</hi> had
compleated their Work, as ſome obſerve; ſo
that the <hi>Rules</hi> which the <hi>Maſorites</hi> obſerved or
made in their <hi>punctation,</hi> are expreſſed in the
<hi>Grammars</hi> which were made after their <hi>puncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
Beſides, If this Argument were of any
force, it might prove the <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſe,</hi>
the <hi>Syriack, Arabick, Perſian,</hi> &amp;c. to have been
always <hi>pointed,</hi> and the <hi>points</hi> coeve with the
<hi>Languages,</hi> which yet is denied by all that are
skilfull in thoſe <hi>Languages,</hi> for all their books
conſiſted at firſt only of <hi>conſonants,</hi> as they are
called, as well as the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and the <hi>points</hi> were
added long after, and <hi>Grammars</hi> compoſed after
all, and gathered out of <hi>pointed Copies.</hi> The
<hi>Chaldee Paraphraſe</hi> was not at firſt <hi>pointed,</hi> as is
proved by <hi>Buxtorf</hi> in his <hi>Chaldee</hi> and <hi>Syriack
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:115995:132"/>
Grammar,</hi> and after it was <hi>pointed,</hi> no <hi>Chaldee
Grammar</hi> was made by any of a long time.
<hi>Elias Levita</hi> found it ſo hard a task, that he
gave it over after he had begun, and <hi>Munſter</hi>
was the firſt that reduced that <hi>Tongue</hi> into
<hi>Grammaticall Rules;</hi> and if it be ſaid that they
<hi>pointed</hi> the <hi>Paraphraſe</hi> according to the <hi>puncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> which they ſuppoſe to
have been always <hi>pointed,</hi> I deny that thoſe few
<hi>Chapters</hi> could give direction for the <hi>puncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the <hi>Paraphraſes,</hi> or the whole <hi>Chaldee
Tongue,</hi> (of which a ſmall part is expreſt in thoſe
<hi>Chapters.)</hi> Neither can this be ſaid of the other
<hi>Tongues,</hi> the <hi>Arabick, Syriack,</hi> &amp;c. of which
<hi>Grammars</hi> were made long after the <hi>punctation,</hi>
and yet it is granted, that their <hi>points</hi> were not
<hi>coeve</hi> with the <hi>Languages.</hi> Let our <hi>Adverſary</hi>
therefore ſhew how the <hi>Grammars</hi> of thoſe
<hi>Tongues</hi> were made after the <hi>punctation,</hi> and ſo
he may anſwer his own objection about the
<hi>Hebrew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XII. He objects further, p. 255, 256. <hi>That
if the punctation had been by the</hi> Maſorites, <hi>they
would have falſified and corrupted the Propheſies
of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>which they might eaſily have done, by
placing the</hi> points <hi>and</hi> accents <hi>ſo as to pervert
the ſence and coherence of the words as in</hi> Eſ. 53.
<hi>where, according to the preſent</hi> punctation, <hi>they
make incomparably more for the</hi> Chriſtian Faith,
<hi>then any ancient Tranſlations.</hi> This is anſwered
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:115995:132"/>
before, where it is ſhewed, that the <hi>Maſorites</hi>
did not <hi>point</hi> the <hi>Text, pro arbitrio,</hi> as they
pleaſed, (as our <hi>Author</hi> would make us ſay) but
according to the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>accuſtomed reading,</hi> to
which they were tyed. This Argument is
brought in the <hi>Prolegom.</hi> 7. to prove that theſe
<hi>Jews</hi> did not, <hi>de induſtria,</hi> corrupt the <hi>Hebrew
Text,</hi> becauſe then they would have corrupted
thoſe places concerning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or where the
chief <hi>myſteries</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
which we ſee they have not meddled
with; but it proves not but that the <hi>Maſorites</hi>
might fix the <hi>points</hi> to the <hi>Text,</hi> the true read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whereof they could not alter, but would
have been preſently diſcovered by the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
nor would they attempt it, the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being ſo zealous for the <hi>letter</hi> of the <hi>Text,</hi>
that as <hi>Joſeph.</hi> ſaith, they would rather die a
thouſand deaths, then wilfully falſifie the leaſt
tittle.</p>
               <p>XIII. Again, pag. 292. he ſaith, <hi>That
though the points might be affixed while the</hi>
Tongue <hi>was common and vulgar, yet after it had
ceaſed to be vulgar for a thouſand years, to think
that</hi> points <hi>could be then fixed to the</hi> Text, <hi>and
the reading continued ſo long by tradition, is to
buid caſtles in the ayre,</hi> &amp;c. But to this we have
already anſwered at large, and ſhewed that the
knowledge of the <hi>Tongue</hi> and the true reading
continued among the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Scribes</hi> after
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:115995:133"/>
it ceaſed to be <hi>vulgar,</hi> who might with as much
caſe <hi>point</hi> the <hi>Text,</hi> (it being the ſame to them
as when it was <hi>vulgar)</hi> as they might have done
whileſt it was commonly ſpoken by the people,
and that it was not continued by <hi>orall tradition;</hi>
for they had the written <hi>Text</hi> for their ground,
as is already declared.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XIV. But there is one Argument more which
he propounds, and follows at large: pag. 225.
226,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>(for we muſt finde out his reaſons,
as they are here and there ſcattered, without
any</hi> method) This he is ſory that others out of
their reſpect to the <hi>Rabbins</hi> have paſſed by. <hi>It is
taken from the</hi> conſideration of the perſons ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to be the <hi>Authors</hi> of the <hi>punctation,</hi> who
were men ſo unfit for ſo Divine and admirable a
Work, that of all the fables in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> he
knows none more incredible then this ſtory, <hi>viz.</hi>
That men: 1. who were no part of the Church,
or people of God, poſſeſſors onely of the letter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
2. Who were remote from the right underſtanding
of the Word of God, deſperately engaged againſt
the Truth,—enemies to the Goſpel. 3. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder
the ſpeciall curſe and vengeance of God. 4. Feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves with vain fables, and miſchievous
devices againſt the Goſpell, labouring to ſet up a
new Religion, under the name of the old. 5. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly
ignorant in all manner of Learning and
Knowledge. 6. Addicted to monſtrous figments,
yea, for the moſt part Idolaters and Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:115995:133"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould be the authors of ſo great and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
a Work, of ſuch unſpeakeable uſefulneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.
This Argument he ſpends neer twenty pages
upon, by a fierce invective againſt the</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi>
Rabbins, <hi>which he after contracts to theſe heads,
p.</hi> 240, 241. &amp;c. <hi>And to ſtrengthen this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he ſaith, p.</hi> 2. 3. That the <hi>Maſorites,</hi> (the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
inventors of the points) cannot by any ſtory or
other record be made appear, that they ever were in
<hi>rerum natura,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and p.</hi> 304. they came, no man
knew whence, and no man knows when and where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>XV. To which Argument I anſwer, Firſt,
That concerning the uſefulneſſe of the preſent
<hi>points,</hi> (which is acknowledged) though I am
none of them that are affected with <hi>novelties,</hi> or
delight in <hi>changes,</hi> yet I am of the opinion of
thoſe <hi>Learned men,</hi> who do not conceive the
preſent <hi>punctation</hi> to be ſo excellent and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat</hi>
a Work, but that it might be much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd made more uſefull; and that there
are ſome things, (eſpecially <hi>accents)</hi> which might
be omitted, of ſome of which none can give a
full account, and the reſt might be reduced to a
ſmaller number, and be made more facile and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
ſome other things alſo might be added which
are uſefull in other <hi>languages,</hi> &amp; wanting in this,
as hath been already ſhewed by divers <hi>Learned
men:</hi> Secondly, That notwithſtanding all this
which is ſaid againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Rabbins,</hi> I
ſhall not need to go further for anſwer then the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:115995:134"/>
Objectors own words, after a few pages, when
his heat was ſomething allayed, p. 251. <hi>That
yet they were men ſtill, who were full able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
what defect they found to be ſo, and what
they ſound to be otherwiſe, and that it cannot be
thought reaſonable that ſo many men, living in ſo
many ſeverall ages, at ſuch vaſt diſtance one from
another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who ſome of them, it may be, never heard
of ſome of the names of others ſome of them, ſhould
conſpire to couzen themſelves, and all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
in a matter of fact, nothing at all to their
advantage:</hi> I apply it thus, That notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all that is ſaid againſt them, yet they were
able to declare <hi>de facto,</hi> the <hi>Reading</hi> of the <hi>Text,</hi>
received and continued amongſt them, and that
it cannot be imagined they ſhould deviſe any
other or new <hi>Reading,</hi> which ſhould be received
by all that lived in ſo many ſeverall ages, and at
ſuch vaſt diſtances, and ſhould conſpire together
to couzen themſelves, and all the world in a
matter of fact, tending nothing at all to their
advantage. Thus we ſee the ſame hand pulling
down in one page what it had ſet up in another.
For if they might be meet witneſſes for the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Originall</hi> of <hi>points,</hi> as he affirms, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
what is ſaid againſt them, why might
they not alſo be meet witneſſes in teſtifying and
declaring the <hi>common</hi> and <hi>received Reading</hi> then
in uſe, and in expreſſing it by their <hi>punctation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XVI. I may adde, that notwithſtanding all
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:115995:134"/>
that is ſaid of them, they were moſt <hi>zealous,</hi> (in
their greateſt <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> and <hi>Infidelity)</hi> about the
<hi>letter</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>true reading</hi> of it,
even to ſuperſtition, and ſo continue: they did
never <hi>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rere in cortice</hi> more then ſince their
rejection by God. And though generally they
be men of no great <hi>Learning</hi> in other matters,
yet about the <hi>reading of the Law,</hi> and right pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
of it, and the knowledge of every
tittle, they were diligent, even to admiration,
and accounted it a great part of their <hi>Learning,</hi>
that they could ſo exactly read the <hi>Law,</hi> and
teach others to read it. Laſtly, for the <hi>Tiberian
Maſorites,</hi> though it be not much materiall by
whom, or when the <hi>points</hi> were fixed, or at
what place they lived, ſo it be granted, they
were not of <hi>Divine Originall,</hi> nor known till
after the <hi>Talmud;</hi> yet notwithſtanding our
Authors <hi>Declamation,</hi> it is moſt probable that
the <hi>Tiberian Maſorites</hi> were the firſt Inventers,
and more probable then any thing by him ſaid
to the contrary; nay, though he denyes that
ever there were any ſuch men <hi>in rerum natura<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>

what he hath ſaid, and contradicting himſelf, as
is uſuall, he tells us, p. 223. <hi>that there was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
a School of the</hi> Jews, <hi>and Learned men,

that ſaying of <hi>Azarias, who aſcribes the reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the</hi> points <hi>to their uſe, after they had
been diſuſed, to the</hi> Tiberian Maſorites: and pag.
270. <hi>That by receiving the</hi> punctation <hi>from the</hi>
Tiberians, <hi>the continuation of it in that School, not
the invention of it is intended by</hi> Abenezra; ſo
that it ſeems, That theſe <hi>Tiberian Maſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,</hi>
who never were <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> and
lieved no man knows where, nor when, are found
out at laſt to have had a School at <hi>Tiberias,</hi> and

               </argument>
               <p>I. <hi>I Should now come to the</hi> Conſequences
<hi>which our</hi> Author <hi>would infer from our
opinion about the</hi> points, <hi>viz.</hi> That if they they
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:115995:135"/>
were invented and fixed to the <hi>Text,</hi> by the
<hi>Maſorites,</hi> then the reading and ſence of the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi>
becomes uncertain and arbitrary, and the
ſupreme authority thereof in all matters of faith
and life is quite overthrown, and we muſt depend
either upon the fidelity and diligence of the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins</hi>
for the true reading and ſence of the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi>
or flie to an infallible Judge, and turn <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi>
or elſe turn plain <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> or <hi>Fanatick An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſcripturiſts,</hi>
by rejecting the <hi>Scripture</hi> altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>Theſe are his inferences, pag. 147. 161.
and</hi> Epiſt. <hi>p. 9. and 25. But the invalidity of
this Argument is already ſhewed at large in
what we have premiſed in the foregoing</hi>
Chapter, <hi>as alſo</hi> Prolegom 3. Sect. 5. 31. <hi>for it</hi> is
<hi>proved</hi> that the reading and ſence is the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and after the <hi>punctation,</hi> and not any way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
upon the authority of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> or of
the <hi>Church,</hi> or of an infallible <hi>Judge. For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
what we have already proved:</hi> 1. That
the <hi>Hebrew Tongue</hi> never wanted its vowels,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which were uſed as vowels before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of <hi>points,</hi> as in other <hi>Eaſtern Languages,</hi>
and that where they were wanting, the connexion
of the words, with the antecedents and conſequents,
together with the continued cuſtom and uſe, did
determine the ſence, and make the Text as it is
now, and free from ambiguity. 2. That the
<hi>Rabbins</hi> did not <hi>point</hi> the Text, <hi>pro arbitrio,</hi> as
they pleaſed, but according as the true and uſuall
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:115995:136"/>
reading continued alwayes among them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from the ſacred Penmen, and that it is
not lawfull now for any to alter or reject the
preſent reading at pleaſure, unleſſe a better read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
can be clearly proved, or that ſome Error
hath crept in, contrary to the ancient reading, <hi>all
theſe</hi> Conſequences <hi>vaniſh to nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. Now for proof of theſe <hi>conſequences</hi> our
<hi>Author</hi> brings nothing, though <hi>affirmanti in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbit
probatio,</hi> but takes theſe things for
granted, which the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> do utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
as altogether falſe and untrue, <hi>viz. 1. That
there are no vowels among the</hi> Hebrew <hi>twenty
two Letters, and ſo that the</hi> Hebrew <hi>had no vowels
before the invention of</hi> points. 2. <hi>That the</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorites
<hi>did point the Text, as they pleaſed, and
ſo that the reading according to the preſent</hi> pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
<hi>depends meerly upon the skill and fidelity
of thoſe</hi> Rabbins. 3. <hi>That it is lawfull for any
to alter the reading at pleaſure, and to accept
or reject the</hi> points, <hi>as no part of the Text.
4. That it was not poſſible to continue the true
reading and ſence of the Text after the</hi> Language
<hi>ceaſed to be vulgar, without the</hi> points; all which
are ſo many miſtakes, and not only rejected by
the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> but by evident
Arguments proved already to be aſſertions void
of truth; ſo that theſe props being taken away,
all his building falls to the ground.</p>
               <p>III. Now in ſtead of reaſons which are
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:115995:136"/>
none, our Adverſary tells us of his own <hi>earneſt
wiſhes and endeavours,</hi> p. 221. <hi>That he had rather
this Work of the Bible, and all works of the like
kind were out of the world, then that this our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
ſhould be received with the Conſequences
which unavoidably attend it,</hi> and pag. 244. <hi>that
he would labour to the utmoſt to have the puncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
taken out of the Bible, if it were the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the</hi> Maſorites, <hi>nor ſhould he (in its preſent
ſtation) make uſe of it any more.</hi> Thus do vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
men run from one extreme into another: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he muſt have the punctation to be of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
authority, or elſe he muſt labour to the
utmoſt to have it out of the Bible. But
theſe <hi>wiſhes</hi> and <hi>violent expreſſions</hi> are no
proofs with ſuch as will not ſwallow his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
by a blind implicit faith, as <hi>Oracles.</hi>
Our opinion of the points hath been and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
received amongſt moſt of thoſe that excell
in this kind of learning, and among the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
&amp; judicious <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Divines, who are
beſt able to judge of things of this nature; nor
will it find the leſs acceptance among learned &amp;
judicious men, becauſe of his hot paſſionate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claming
againſt it; for heat and paſſion are but
weak proofs of the truth of any opinion, they
are like water that bears up the lighteſt
things, and lets the heavyeſt ſink to the bottome,
and are indeed no better aguments then that
of him in <hi>Scaliger,</hi> who would prove that by
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:115995:137"/>
laying a wager which he could not make good
by ſound reaſon. If he be ſo earneſt to have
the <hi>Hebrew points</hi> taken away (ſuppoſing they be
not of <hi>Divine Originall)</hi> why doth he not labour
the ſame for the <hi>Accents, notes of aſpiration,</hi> and
<hi>diſtinction of Sentences</hi> in the <hi>Greek</hi> Text of the
<hi>New Teſtament,</hi> it being certain that they were
not in uſe when the New Teſtament was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
as we have proved <hi>proleg. 3. Sect.</hi> 45.
and in the precedent Chapter, and that the
<hi>Greek</hi> Text is ſubject to <hi>ambiguity</hi> in diverſe
places by the abſence of the <hi>accents</hi> and <hi>notes of
diſtinction:</hi> whether doth he like it better to
have the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> Printed with <hi>accents</hi>
and <hi>diſtinctions,</hi> as it is now, or to have it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any, as it is in the <hi>Complutenſe Bible,</hi>
which is ſo Printed, as I have ſhewed, that it
might the better repreſent the <hi>Originall Copies</hi>
which were written firſt without <hi>accents?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. As for the advantage which <hi>Papiſts,
Atheiſts, &amp;c.</hi> make of this, with his intimation,
as if all were <hi>looking towards</hi> Rome <hi>that hold this
opinion,</hi> I ſhall not need to ſay more then hath
been ſaid already, when from the various Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
he would have inferred the ſame Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
on the behalf of <hi>Papiſts, &amp;c.</hi> It is
enough to ſhew the vanity of this ſurmiſe, that
the greateſt and learnedeſt defenders of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
cauſe, and of the authority of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
Texts, have been, and are of this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:115995:137"/>
What ſome <hi>Romaniſts</hi> inferre upon this
<hi>Principle</hi> is nothing, unleſſe it could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>juſtly</hi> to follow, which neither they nor
this Author are ever able to do. He might
have taken notice that his objection is anſwered
<hi>Prolegom. 3. Sect.</hi> 51. where this inference
which ſome of that <hi>Church</hi> make of the <hi>ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity</hi>
of Scripture unpointed, and that inſtance
of <hi>Morinus</hi> in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which without
<hi>points</hi> may be read eight ſeverall wayes, and
hath ſo many ſignifications, is taken away. Nor
do all thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> urge this <hi>Conſequence;</hi> there
are not wanting among them who maintain,
that the <hi>Text</hi> unpointed is <hi>certain,</hi> and not <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous,</hi>
as <hi>Simeon de Muis, Joh. de Eſpieres,</hi>
and others. And although many of them ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
againſt the Scripture in generall, as our
Author doth, that the Text unpointed is <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
and therefore no fit rule of <hi>faith and
life,</hi> yet I do not remember that in any <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Controverſie</hi> between them and us, they
urge any one place of Scripture for their cauſe,
upon the <hi>uncertainty</hi> of the <hi>Reading</hi> without
<hi>points,</hi> which plainly ſhews that there is no ſuch
<hi>uncertainty</hi> in the <hi>Text</hi> unpointed, as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by them and this Author, for they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
all places according to the <hi>common Reading</hi>
of the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or the <hi>vulgar Latine.</hi> Let our
Adverſary therefore name any place in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
where the <hi>ambiguity</hi> of the <hi>Text</hi> without
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:115995:138"/>
                  <hi>points</hi> makes for them or againſt us, or where
they have advantage upon this ground in any
particular caſe controverted, or elſe this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
will appear a meer cavil.</p>
               <p>V. I do therefore appeal to all rational men,
and do challenge our Adverſary with all the <hi>rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
of thoſe he mentions, as joyning with him
in this Inference, all the <hi>Papiſts, Atheiſts, fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
perſons, &amp;c.</hi> in the world to make good
their Conſequence of the uncertainty of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
from that opinion of the <hi>punctation,</hi> as it
is declared and limited in the <hi>Prolegomena, viz.
That if the points were fixed by the</hi> Maſorites <hi>to
the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Text (that is, as the caſe is ſtated)
underſtanding onely the forms and figures of the
points, not the force and vertue of the vowels and
accents themſelves, which is acknowledged to
have alwayes been, and that they did neither
point the Text at pleaſure, but according to the
true Reading commonly received to which they
were tyed; nor that any now may at pleaſure reject
this Reading by the points.</hi> That upon this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
thus ſtated, it doth neceſſarily follow, <hi>That
the Scripture is dubious and uncertain, and cannot
be a ſure rule for faith and life.</hi> This <hi>Conſequence</hi>
if they can prove I will retract my opinion and
acknowledge my error: But if our Adverſary
cannot prove it, I expect he ſhould do the like.</p>
               <p>VI. But now as it was obſerved before about
the <hi>various Readings,</hi> ſo here the ſame may be
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:115995:138"/>
obſerved about this queſtion of the <hi>points,</hi> that
the Adverſary unawares pleads the cauſe of
them whom he would ſeem to oppoſe, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
he would make others guilty of promoting
<hi>Popery, Atheiſme, &amp;c.</hi> himſelf is moſt deeply
guilty by his own Arguments: for he grants the
conſequence which they urge, to be <hi>neceſſary</hi>
and <hi>true,</hi> as will appear, if it be brought into a
Syllogiſme, which runs thus. If the points
and accents be not of <hi>Divine Originall,</hi> but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed
by the <hi>Maſorites</hi> to the <hi>Text,</hi> then the
<hi>Scripture</hi> is <hi>uncertain,</hi> capable of <hi>divers ſences,</hi>
and therefore no fit rule for faith and life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
But they were affixed by the <hi>Maſorites</hi> to the
Text, and are not of <hi>Divine Originall. Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Concluſion</hi> of the <hi>Syllogiſme</hi> we all agree
is <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>impious,</hi> and therefore one or both
<hi>Propoſitions</hi> muſt of neceſſity be <hi>falſe.</hi> I ſhould
deny both, if it could ſtand with <hi>evidence</hi> of
<hi>truth,</hi> but granting that which cannot be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and which the ableſt and learnedeſt men
that the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> cauſe ever had grant to be
true, I do with the ſame perſons denie the
<hi>Major</hi> or the Conſequence, and lay the weight
of the cauſe upon it, which all the <hi>Papiſts, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts,</hi>
and <hi>Conſiderators</hi> in the world are never
able to prove. The Adverſary on the other
hand, 1. Denies the <hi>Minor,</hi> which his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites
may with more probability make good,
then he can the contrary, they having not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:115995:139"/>
the learned of their own Church, but alſo
the beſt learned Proteſtants (as I have ſaid)
affirming the ſame with many ſtrong reaſons,
which to any man unbiaſſed will ſeem more
concluding then thoſe brought for the other o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.
And 2. He grants the <hi>Conſequence,</hi> yea
proves it as well as he can (which all ſober
Chriſtians, and all that have not joyned hands
with Papiſts, Atheiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> deny) from which
that <hi>Concluſion</hi> inevitably follows. <hi>That the
Scripture is uncertain, and therefore of no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in matters of faith, &amp;.</hi> Let all men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
judge who it is that pleades the cauſe of
<hi>Papiſts, &amp;c.</hi> He who denies the <hi>Conſequence,</hi>
or he that grants it, and labours to make it
good. Thus he is caught in his own net, and
unexcuſable before God and man, by betraying
the cauſe which he pretends to defend, and by
doing that himſelf of which he unjuſtly accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
another.</p>

               <p>I. WE have gone through the chief Heads
of our Adverſaries Charge; <hi>The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Readings and the pointing of the</hi> Hebrew
<hi>Text.</hi> We ſhall with more ſpeed paſſe over the
reſt, by which he pretends the worth and eſteem
of the <hi>Hebrew Text</hi> is depreſſed, as the deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
our knowledge of the <hi>Hebrew Tongue</hi> from
the <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of the LXX. and making the
<hi>Samaritane Characters</hi> to be the <hi>old Hebrew let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
of which now we ſhall ſpeak briefly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. For the firſt,</hi> Pag. 206. <hi>He ſaith,</hi> That the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the <hi>Proleg.</hi> grants that all our knowledge
of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is taken from the Tranſlation of the
<hi>LXX</hi> as he is quoted to that purpoſe by <hi>Morinus,</hi>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:115995:140"/>
Praef. ad Opuſc. Samarit. <hi>The ſame is twice
mentioned in his</hi> Epiſtle, <hi>p. 10. and 26. which
he diſproves</hi> by the example of <hi>Hierom,</hi> who had
his knowledge of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue by the help
of <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and by the <hi>Tiberian Maſorites,</hi> who
<hi>pointed</hi> the Text acccording to the tradition of
them that ſpake the <hi>Language</hi> in its purity, and
could not have the knowledge of it from the <hi>Sept.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. For anſwer, Firſt, why doth not our
<hi>Adverſary</hi> name the place in the <hi>Biblia Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glotta,</hi>
where theſe words are to be found; or
if they be not there any where to be found, (as
indeed they are not) why doth he put theſe
among the haynous crimes with which he
charges the <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> affirming elſewhere,
p. l. 52. 160. <hi>That had not theſe Tenets been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
with the</hi> Biblia Polyglotta, <hi>thereby to gain

                     </gap> with them.</hi> Now, this I am ſure is no
where in the <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> or in the <hi>Biblia Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glotta.</hi>
And if this be not, why will he upon the
words of <hi>Morinus,</hi> (a petulant <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> as he will
make him) Why, I ſay, will he accuſe any upon
ſuch a mans Teſtimony as his, whom he calls in
his railing <hi>Rhetorick, an infamous perſon, a bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Dogg,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> when as he could finde no
ſuch thing in the <hi>Biblia Polyglotta?</hi> But the
truth is, <hi>Morinus</hi> doth not ſay, that this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of <hi>Capellus</hi> is approved in the <hi>Bibia Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glotta,</hi>
(which our <hi>Adverſary</hi> very well knew)
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:115995:140"/>
but that <hi>in diſſertation, or preface to an Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
to the reading of the</hi> Orientall Tongues,
<hi>he approves that opinion of</hi> Capellus. Now what
is this to the <hi>Biblia Polyglotta?</hi> and yet the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
of the <hi>diſſertation</hi> doth neither in that <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertation,</hi>
nor any where elſe, wholly ſubſcribe
to <hi>Capellus</hi> his <hi>opinion,</hi> whatſoever <hi>Morinus</hi>
ſaith, which this <hi>Author</hi> could not be ignorant
of: his words are only theſe, ſpeaking of the
uſe of the <hi>Greek Sept. Exigua eſſet abſque hac
(verſione</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>linguae</hi> Hebraeae <hi>congnitio.</hi> There
is ſome difference between <hi>nulla,</hi> and <hi>exigua,</hi>
the former he never ſaid, for he knows, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
affirms, that though the <hi>Hebrew</hi> ceaſed
to be <hi>vulgarly</hi> ſpoken after the return from <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>
yet there remained alwayes among the
<hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Learned</hi> of that Nation, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the <hi>Tongue,</hi> which they continued and
taught to their children and poſterity: yet for
the knowledge of it among <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> the
greateſt part of their knowledge of the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
came by the <hi>Greek Tranſlation</hi> of the <hi>LXX.</hi> that
being the onely <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of any <hi>Hebrew book</hi>
known among <hi>either Chriſtians</hi> or <hi>Jews,</hi> and this
was made ſhortly after it had ceaſed to be vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
and therefore without this <hi>exigua foret,</hi>
amongſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> the knowledge of the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> had been little; for there is no book
extant, written in pure <hi>Hebrew,</hi> ſave only the
<hi>Bible,</hi> nor any <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of it before <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:115995:141"/>
ſave that of the <hi>LXX.</hi> and therefore, as <hi>Clenard</hi>
and <hi>Erpenius</hi> attained the <hi>Arabick</hi> by the
<hi>Tranſlations</hi> out of that <hi>Tongue</hi> in the <hi>Nebienſe
Pſalter,</hi> and other <hi>Arabick books,</hi> ſo I doubt
not, but that out of this <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Tongue</hi> might be learned. And therefore for
thoſe that wanted the teaching and inſtruction
of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Maſters, their knowledg of the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
would be little, without this <hi>Tranſlation.</hi> And no
queſtion but <hi>Origen</hi> in his <hi>Hexapla,</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi>
in his <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> made great uſe of that <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation</hi>
to this end, though I know very well, that
<hi>Hierom</hi> made uſe alſo of divers <hi>Jewiſh Rabbins,</hi>
and amongſt others, of ſome <hi>Tiberian</hi> Doctors
of note, as himſelf affirms, who were not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thoſe <hi>Tiberians</hi> that <hi>pointed</hi> the <hi>Hebr.</hi> Text.</p>
               <p>IV. But now what is this, (ſuppoſing all were
true what he affirms) to the <hi>depreſſing of the</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
<hi>Text,</hi> or to prove the <hi>uncertainty</hi> of the
<hi>Scripture,</hi> or that the <hi>Text</hi> is <hi>corrupt?</hi> I ſee not
any colour of ſuch a <hi>Conſequence,</hi> nor doth our
<hi>adverſary</hi> bring any reaſon to prove it. It is true,
<hi>Arnol. Bootius</hi> in his furious <hi>invective</hi> againſt <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellus,</hi>
takes hold of his words, and would prove
this to be falſe, but infers no ſuch thing as this
<hi>Author</hi> doth, as if hereby the <hi>Heb. Text</hi> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered,
which if he could with any color have
made good, I am ſure he would not have omitted.</p>
               <p>V. We come now to the laſt of theſe things
which tend to <hi>the depreſſion of the eſteem of
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:115995:141"/>
the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Text;</hi> which, among others, is
reckoned by our <hi>Adverſary</hi> in the firſt place.
Pag. 205. viz. <hi>That the preſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Hebrew <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
is not that uſed by God himſelf, and in
the Old Church before the Captivity of</hi> Babylon,
<hi>but it is the</hi> Chaldean, <hi>the other being left to the</hi>
Samaritanes. The ſame is alſo mentioned, <hi>Epiſt.</hi>
p. 7. This queſtion is handled at large, <hi>Proleg. 3.
Sect. 29.—38.</hi> I might forbear to ſpeak any
thing more thereof, becauſe it makes nothing
at all againſt the <hi>Hebrew Text,</hi> though we
make the preſent <hi>Character</hi> to have been the
<hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> and that the old <hi>Hebrew Character</hi>
was left to the <hi>Samaritanes;</hi> for ſeeing that we
make <hi>Eſdras</hi> and his aſſociates the <hi>Authors</hi> of
this <hi>change,</hi> when they reſtored and ſettled the
<hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and it is confeſſed
by all, that what they did, was by <hi>Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:</hi>
hence it is evident, that the <hi>Authority</hi>
of the <hi>Hebrew Text</hi> ſuffers nothing by this
<hi>change</hi> of the <hi>Character,</hi> but that it is in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
the ſame it was before: no more, nor ſo
much as the <hi>change</hi> of the <hi>Greek Character,</hi> and
of the manner of writing in <hi>capitall letters,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>accents, ſpirits,</hi> or <hi>diſtinctions</hi> of words or
ſentences, as the firſt <hi>Copies</hi> of the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
were written, (as we have elſwhere ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Prolegom. 3. Sect.</hi> 45. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. of this
<hi>Treatiſe)</hi> into that form which is now in uſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogates
from the <hi>Greek Text</hi> of the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:115995:142"/>
becauſe this <hi>change</hi> was not made by any
<hi>Prophets</hi> or <hi>men</hi> inſpired as the other was; and
therefore our <hi>Author</hi> had no colour of reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this amongſt thoſe things which derogate
from the <hi>Hebrew Text,</hi> but that he was willing
to catch at any thing which might ſeem to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
the <hi>Eſteem</hi> of the <hi>Biblia Polyglotta</hi> amongſt
his <hi>Engliſh Readers,</hi> for whoſe <hi>miſ-information</hi>
theſe <hi>Conſiderations</hi> were contrived, unleſſe he
thinks with ſome <hi>ſuperſtitious Jews,</hi> that there
is ſome peculiar ſanctity in the form or faſhion
of the <hi>Character.</hi> Nevertheleſſe, becauſe he
hath thought fit to ſay ſomething of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
though he touch not the tenth part of
what is ſaid in the <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> becauſe he
would fain ſeduce the ignorant <hi>Reader</hi> into an
opinion, as if great wrong were hereby offered
to the <hi>Hebrew Text,</hi> I ſhall therefore briefly
adde ſomething by way of anſwer.</p>
               <p>VI. This Queſtion hath been ſo clearly and
fully handled by <hi>Scaliger, Druſius, Voſſius, Capel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
and others, that I believe there are few that
have read and weighed the arguments of both
ſides, who think the preſent <hi>Character</hi> to be the
old <hi>Hebrew letter.</hi> It is true, <hi>Buxtorf jun.</hi> wrot
a Tract upon this Subject, wherein he doth not
abſolutely defend as a certain truth, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<hi>Character</hi> is that which was uſed at firſt,
though he brings all the Arguments he could to
this purpoſe, but only to ſhew, as he ſaith, <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:115995:142"/>
that this opinion is not ſo <hi>abſurd,</hi> or apparantly
<hi>falſe,</hi> as <hi>Scaliger, Druſius,</hi> and other great <hi>Hebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
would have it, but that it may be probably
defended. To this <hi>Diſſertation</hi> of his, <hi>Capellus</hi>
wrote an anſwer, 1645. (which I conceive began
the quarrell between theſe two <hi>learned men,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
hath been ſince continued with two much eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
about other matters) wherein all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
are anſwered, and the contrary reaſons
urged and defended, with that evidence and
cleerneſſe, that <hi>Buxtorf</hi> hath not made any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
ſince that time, that I have ſeen, though he
hath ſince written againſt <hi>Capellus</hi> upon other
ſubjects, being, it may be, convinced of the <hi>Error</hi>
of that opinion, which he thought formerly not
improbable, which if it be ſo, as his ingenuity
is to be commended, ſo the confidence of our
<hi>Adverſary</hi> is to be condemned, who is perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in a queſtion, which as it plainly appears, he
never ſeriouſly conſidered, not ſticking (after
his uſuall manner) to call this opinion <hi>a Fiction,</hi>
and <hi>a meer Fable,</hi> though it be in a manner <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated,</hi>
and hath as <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>evident Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
for it, as any thing of this nature is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of, <hi>viz. Teſtimonies,</hi> both of <hi>ancient Jews</hi>

of moſt, if not of all the beſt skilled in <hi>Jewiſh</hi>

               <p>VIII. The Arguments of both ſides are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
<hi>Prolegom.</hi> 3. which I ſhall not need
to repeat, but ſhall refer the <hi>Reader</hi> thither for
fuller ſatisfaction, and the rather, becauſe the
<hi>Adverſary</hi> brings nothing to the contrary, but
his own <hi>conjectures,</hi> or bare <hi>affirmations</hi> without
proofs, (what he ſaith of the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> is
already anſwered in its proper place) I ſhall
only <hi>recapitulate</hi> what is largely handled in the
<hi>Prolegomena</hi> concerning theſe <hi>Characters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IX. All the Arguments that can be brought
to prove a matter of fact, eſpecially of ſuch An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
can be no other then <hi>Teſtimonies,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
of <hi>ancient</hi> and <hi>credible Writers,</hi> who might
beſt know the truth, the remaining <hi>Reliques,</hi>
and <hi>Monuments</hi> of ſuch <hi>Characters,</hi> with the
judgement of ſuch of later times; who have
been moſt verſed in things of this nature, and
therefore are beſt able to judge; all which
we have here. Among <hi>ancient Writers,</hi> we have
the <hi>Teſtimonie</hi> both of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Jews:</hi> Of
<hi>Chriſtians, Euſeb. Hier.</hi> &amp; <hi>Bede,</hi> men beſt skilled
of any in their times, in <hi>Jewiſh</hi> &amp; other <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
who affirm it as a thing certainly known,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:115995:144"/>
and not to be doubted of, that <hi>Eſdras</hi> changed
the old <hi>Character</hi> into that we now uſe, leaving
the other to the <hi>Samaritanes,</hi> whoſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
eſpecially <hi>Hieromes</hi> is ſo expreſſe, and the
thing ſo frequently affirmed in his Works, that
they admit no evaſion, as appears in the ſame
<hi>Prolegomena,</hi> where all the <hi>ſubterfuges</hi> brought
to evade the force of the words are plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuted
and taken away. And when we name
theſe, we name all that among the <hi>Ancients</hi> have
ſaid any thing on this ſubject; nor is there any
one <hi>ancient Writer</hi> produced, that hath ſaid any
thing to the contrary.</p>
               <p>X. To the Teſtimonies of <hi>ancient Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
we have added the Teſtimonies of both
the <hi>Talmuds,</hi> which with the <hi>Jews</hi> are of ſacred
and unqueſtionable Authority. The <hi>Babyloniſh
Tract. Sanhedr. Sect.</hi> 2. The <hi>Hieruſalem Tract.
Megil. Sect</hi> 1. affirming, that the Law was firſt
given, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Scriptura Hebraea,</hi> and
afterwards, in the dayes of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> it was
written, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Scriptura Aſſyriaca;</hi>
as alſo the teſtimonies both of <hi>ancient</hi> and
<hi>modern Rabbins,</hi> who (though ſome of them,
eſpecially of the later, that they may maintain
the antiquity of the preſent <hi>Character</hi> againſt
the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> feign among other things, that
<hi>Moſes</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was written in the <hi>modern
Character,</hi> which they call <hi>Sacred,</hi> and that the
reſt of the <hi>Copies</hi> for <hi>common uſe,</hi> were written
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:115995:144"/>
in the <hi>common Character,</hi> which is retained by
the <hi>Samaritanes,</hi> and that the uſe of the <hi>ſacred
Character,</hi> was onely reſtored by <hi>Eſdras,</hi> after
it had been long diſuſed,) yet all agree in this,
that the <hi>preſent Samaritane Characters</hi> were
anciently uſed among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that ſome
<hi>Copies</hi> were written in them, which teſtimonie
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> againſt themſelves, in a matter which
they think, tends to the diſparagement of their
<hi>Character,</hi> is an undeniable proof, that onely
the evidence of truth forced this confeſſion
from them.</p>
               <p>XI. But above all, that of the <hi>Shekels,</hi> or
<hi>ancient Coyns,</hi> heretofore, and lately digged up
about <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and other <hi>adjacent</hi> places,
ſtampt on the one ſide with <hi>Aarons Rod,</hi> and the
other with the <hi>Pot of Manna,</hi> and the <hi>inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

the one ſide, and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Siclus Iſraelis</hi>
on the other, if there were no other argument,
were enough to demonſtrate to all that do not
wilfully ſhut their eyes, the truth of our <hi>aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
as is there proved at large: <hi>Ar. Montanus,</hi>
and <hi>Poſtellus,</hi> having got ſome of theſe <hi>Coyns,</hi>
eſteemed them as great <hi>treaſures</hi> and undoubted
proofs of the <hi>ancient Jewiſh Coyns,</hi> and alſo of
their weights. That they were coyned by the
<hi>Samaritanes,</hi> cannot be imagined, becauſe they
were never poſſeſſed of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> nor would
have given the title of <hi>Sancta,</hi> to that City,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:115995:145"/>
which they did abominate, and that they were
before the <hi>Captivity, Ar. Mont. Poſtellus,</hi>
and others collect from the name of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
which was the common name of all the <hi>Tribes</hi>
before the defection and carrying away of the
<hi>Ten Tribes,</hi> when they were ſtiled Jews and not
before, from <hi>Juda</hi> the chief of the remaining
Tribes. To this we ſhall adde one thing more,
either the preſent <hi>Hebrew</hi> Character is borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the <hi>Chaldee,</hi> or elſe we muſt hold that
of the Eaſtern Languages, the <hi>Syriack</hi> and <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi>
have each his diſtinct proper Character,
and the Hebrew, but the <hi>Chaldee</hi> none at all,
which how probable it is, let any man judge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XII. Againſt this what ſaith our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
he ſaith p.</hi> 262. That all is a groundleſſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and a meer fable. That <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſpake
onely upon report, and as for <hi>Hierome</hi> ſuppoſing
this to be falſe, ſufficient inſtances may be given of
the like miſtakes in him. The Teſtimony of the
Talmuds is with him of no weight, unleſſe ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by very good evidence. To that of the ſhekels,
that we are in the high rode of forgeries and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
in nothing hath the world been more cheated.
And if it be granted that the pretended coins be
truly ancient, muſt it needs follow, that becauſe
theſe letters were then known and in uſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they
onely were ſo, or that the Bible was written with
them, and thoſe now in uſe unknown? <hi>Then</hi> to
ſalve the credit of the coins, he will anſwer one
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:115995:145"/>
conjecture with another. The <hi>Samaritane</hi> letters
are (if he may ſo ſay) plainly praeternatural, a
ſtudied invention in their frame and figure, fit to
adorn when extended, or greatned by way of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graving
and emboſſing any thing that ſhall be put
upon them, or cut in; that we may think they
were invented for that purpoſe, namely to engrave
on veſſels, and ſtamp on Coins, and ſo came to
be of ſome uſe in writing alſo, and that their
ſtamp and form promiſes ſome ſuch thing. All
which is the more probable, becauſe <hi>Clemens</hi> tells
us of three ſorts of Characters among the Aegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians,
one for things of common uſe, another,
Hierographick, uſed by the Prieſts in their ſacred
Writings, and the other Hieroglyphick, which was
alſo of two ſorts, ſimple, and ſymbolicall, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it was not unuſuall to have ſundry ſorts of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
for ſundry purpoſes, it is not improbable, that
it was ſo alſo among the Jews.</p>
               <p>XIII. To all this I might refer the Reader
to the ſame <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> where all this, and
a great deal more is fully anſwered. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
I ſay, 1. To call that a <hi>groundleſſe Tradition</hi>
and a <hi>meer fable,</hi> which is ſupported with the
teſtimonies of ſuch <hi>grave</hi> and <hi>learned Authors,</hi>
both ancient and modern, confirmed by both
<hi>Talmuds,</hi> and chief <hi>Rabbins,</hi> and by <hi>reall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents,</hi>
and <hi>ocular demonſtrations,</hi> which like
<hi>Memnons</hi> ſtatue ſpeak aloud for the truth of
this aſſertion, and upon ſuch ſleight conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:115995:146"/>
as are by the Adverſary produced, ſhew
a high degree of <hi>raſhneſſe. Euſebius</hi> not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirms this change of the <hi>Character,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
gives one chief reaſon why, That the <hi>Jews</hi>
might have nothing common with the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes,</hi>
whom they hated <hi>cane pejus &amp; angue,
Hierome,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>ſuppoſing this to be falſe, might
be miſtaken:</hi> nay, I ſay, he was certainly miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<hi>ſuppoſing this to be falſe,</hi> and ſo if this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
kind of arguing may be allowed, our
Author ſuppoſing all he writes to be falſe, was
miſtaken in every thing. But it is not enough
to ſuppoſe he was miſtaken, but to prove it;
and to inferre that becauſe he was miſtaken in
ſome other things, that therefore he was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
in this, is the way to decry all humane
teſtimony at once, all <hi>Hiſtories</hi> and <hi>Records</hi> are
by this means made uſeleſſe, for if they miſtake
in ſome things, they muſt be believed in nothing,
and ſo our Author, becauſe in his Treatife he
miſtakes in many things (as I believe he will
not, I am ſure he cannot juſtly deny) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he muſt not be believed in any thing. I
confeſſe he that willingly affirms untruth in
ſome things, deſerves not to believed in any
thing: but that he who miſtakes in ſome things
through <hi>inadvertency,</hi> or involuntary error
muſt be believed in nothing, is to take away the
credit of all <hi>hiſtories</hi> in matters paſt, and the
ground of all <hi>civil ſociety</hi> and <hi>commerce</hi> among
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:115995:146"/>
men for preſent and future times. The <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muds</hi>
are of higheſt authority with thoſe againſt
whom we chiefly argue, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>modern Jews,</hi>
and therefore cannot be denied either by them,
or by any that imbrace their opinion, nor
was their authority ever denied in this point
by any that I have read, either <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
till now, but ſome kinde of anſwer,
though abſurd and fooliſh hath been found
out, rather then they would wholly deny
their <hi>authority:</hi> and though the <hi>Talmuds</hi> be
full of fables, yet by his own rule, if that
which they affirm be atteſted by other good
evidence, as here it is, in this caſe their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
ought to be of weight. But the ſame
anſwer ſerves for all, <hi>Euſebius, Hierome, the Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muds,
the Rabbins are all deceived, their reports
fabulous, and the Shekels are forged and feigned.</hi>
Here is a ready way to anſwer all arguments of
this kind, to deny all authority, and to ſay,
<hi>that all is falſe and fabulous.</hi> But this is a ſign
of a <hi>deſperate cauſe</hi> to deny all without ſhew of
reaſon to the contrary, which is to cut the knot
when it cannot be looſed. There are many
counterfeit coins I grant, I have ſeen ſome
<hi>Jewiſh coins</hi> which might eaſily be diſcovered
to be forged, of which I have ſpoken in the
place above mentioned, but to infer thence that
all are forged, and that there is no way to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
between thoſe that are true, and thoſe
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:115995:147"/>
that are counterfeit, is as if one ſhould ſay,
that all the old <hi>Romane coins,</hi> which are daily
found and digged up among us are counterfeit,
becauſe ſome ſuch have been counterfeited,
ſee <hi>Proleg. 3. Sect.</hi> 35.</p>
               <p>XIV. But that he may not ſeem to deny all
without ſome ſhew of reaſon, he brings in a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture</hi>
to anſwer, as he calls it, a <hi>conjecture;</hi> But
1. the proof from the <hi>coins</hi> is not a <hi>bare conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi>
but as clear a <hi>demonſtration,</hi> as in things of
this nature can be had. 2. His <hi>Conjecture</hi> is a
<hi>groundleſſe fancy,</hi> which none could ever have
hit on beſides himſelf, he tells us the letters of
the <hi>Sicles</hi> are <hi>preternaturall,</hi> which what it
means, I believe himſelf can hardly explain. I
never heard before of this diſtinction of letters,
into naturall and preternaturall: Are there
ſome letters naturall? I thought that all <hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters</hi>
had been the <hi>arbitrary invention</hi> of men,
not any from the <hi>dictate</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> elſe there had
not been ſuch variety of them in the world: It
ſeems then there is an <hi>univerſall Character</hi> by
nature, and ſo they might have ſpared their
pains that have ſtudied ſo much for the inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of an <hi>univerſall Character</hi> for the uſe of
all Nations. <hi>Preternaturall Characters</hi> then
muſt be ſuch as proceed from ſome error in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as <hi>monſters</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>praeter intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem
naturae,</hi> productions wherein nature fails,
and comes ſhort of her end. The <hi>Samaritane
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:115995:147"/>
Character</hi> then, it ſeems, is ſome <hi>monſtrous Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi>
framed beſides natures intention: and if
ſo, why may there not be alſo ſome <hi>Characters
ſupernatural,</hi> uſed by angels and ſpirits, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
what <hi>Duretus</hi> writes againſt them,
<hi>De linguis totius univerſi,</hi> and <hi>Bangus de litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
Angelicarum vanitate,</hi> ſuch it may, as <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Enochi,</hi> in Dr. <hi>Dee,</hi> written by direction
of his <hi>ſpirits.</hi> Here is new Doctrine of letters
not heard of before. Theſe <hi>Samaritane</hi> letters
then upon coins are <hi>monſtrous letters,</hi> but if they
be ſuch, how come they to be a <hi>ſtudied inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and found out to adorn and emboſſe veſſels and
coins,</hi> I had thought that <hi>preternaturall iſſues</hi>
had been moſt deformed and ugly, but here it
ſeems, <hi>they adorn pots and coins.</hi> But what
great ornament is there in theſe letters upon
coins (for I never ſaw any upon veſſels, nor
himſelf I think) more then in other letters; or
what ſtudied invention is there in them? they
ſeem to me the plaineſt and rudeſt letters of any
(an argument of their antiquity) far from any
curioſity or ſtudied artifice, many other <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters</hi>
are far more curious, intricate, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult,
as thoſe may ſee that ſhall look over the
ſeverall <hi>Alphabets,</hi> Printed <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>leg.</hi> 2. and that
make as fair a ſhew. I have ſeen Coyns both
with theſe letters before the <hi>Captivity,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſtampt with the modern letter ſince the
<hi>Captivity,</hi> and in my poore judgement there is
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:115995:148"/>
no more adorning in the one, then in the other.
This <hi>preternatural Character</hi> I doubt will prove
nothing elſe but the preternaturall iſſue of a
miſguided fancy, or of one willing to frame,
and coin any thing, rather then to ſubmit to
clear truth.</p>
               <p>XV. But yet there might be ſome other
<hi>Character</hi> beſides this, with which the <hi>Bible</hi>
might be written: Here he brings in that figment
of <hi>R. Azarias,</hi> of a <hi>twofold Character,</hi> one <hi>ſacred</hi>
with which the <hi>Bible</hi> was written, and one <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
for other uſes, and in which the <hi>Samaritanes</hi>
writ their <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> which he would confirm
by the practiſe of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> that had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
ſorts of <hi>Characters.</hi> Of the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Characters</hi> I have ſpoken at large <hi>Proleg.
2.</hi> and that deviſe of <hi>Azarias</hi> taken up by
ſome others, the better to uphold their opinion
of the modern letters, is proved to be a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
conceit. <hi>Proleg.</hi> 3. That among the <hi>Heathens</hi>
they uſed ſome <hi>ſecret Character,</hi> which was
counted <hi>ſacred,</hi> thereby to hide their <hi>propha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e
myſteries</hi> from vulgar knowledge is ſhewed in
the ſame place, leſt if the people ſhould know
all, they ſhould contemn and deride them, but
that there were any ſuch among the <hi>Jews,</hi> or
people of God, is a thing meerly deviſed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the force of this Argument, without any
ground either in Scripture, or any ancient
Writer, nay againſt both, and againſt clear
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:115995:148"/>
reaſon, as is there ſhewed, to which place I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the <hi>Reader,</hi> where the <hi>vanity</hi> of this <hi>two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Character</hi> is ſufficienly proved.</p>
               <p>XVI. But here comes in another Argument,
againſt this change of <hi>Eſdras, That the ground
upon which this ſuppoſed change was made, ſhews
the thing to be a</hi> meer fancie, viz. <hi>that the</hi> Jews
<hi>had forgot their old</hi> Character, <hi>during the ſeventy
years</hi> captivity, <hi>and had learned the</hi> Chaldean,
<hi>when as the ſame men were alive at the burning
of the firſt, and the building of the ſecond Temple,
and that the men of the ſame Generation ſhould
forget the uſe of their own</hi> Letters, <hi>is incredible.
Beſides, they had their</hi> Bibles, <hi>and that in their
own</hi> Character <hi>onely, whether they had any other
Book or no, we know not, and whence this forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the one, and learning of another</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<hi>ſhould ariſe, doth not appear.</hi> Again, <hi>the
weight of this improbable fiction is laid upon the
teſtimony whereof the moſt ancient is ſix hundred
years after the pretended matter of fact.</hi> All this
is to as little purpoſe as the reſt. For, firſt, that
the <hi>Jews</hi> had forgot their native <hi>Language,</hi>
and learned the <hi>Chaldean</hi> in that ſeventy years,
is the <hi>unanimous</hi> opinion of men verſed in theſe
matters, both the <hi>Buxtorfs</hi> and all others that
I have read of, <hi>(Mayerus</hi> only excepted, whoſe
reaſons are examined, <hi>Proleg. 3.)</hi> And this they
could not chooſe but do, (though they kept
the <hi>Language</hi> for two hundred years in <hi>Egypt)</hi>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:115995:149"/>
becauſe they lived diſperſed over <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> under
their ſeverall Lords and Maſters, whoſe ſervants
and vaſſalls they were, and therefore might
eaſily forget their own <hi>Language,</hi> and muſt of
neceſſity learn the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> where they were
born and brought up, whereas in <hi>Egypt</hi> they
lived all together in one place, not mingled
with the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> Now, if they forgot their
<hi>Language,</hi> and changed it, why not the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi>
too? Or if ſome of them kept both, yet
the <hi>Chaldee</hi> muſt needs be better known to them
then the other, as being in daily uſe among
them; yet it is not denied, but that as the
knowledge of the <hi>Hebrew Tongue,</hi> ſo of the
<hi>Character</hi> too, did continue among the <hi>Prieſts</hi>
and <hi>Scribes,</hi> and among ſome few of the <hi>old
men,</hi> who might remember the ſtanding of the
<hi>old Temple;</hi> but what were theſe to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of the common people, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
only the <hi>Tongue</hi> where they were born
and bred, and ſo could have little knowledge
of any other <hi>Character</hi> then that in common
uſe where they lived, and hence it was, that
when the <hi>Law</hi> was read; the <hi>Levites</hi> were fain
to expound it in the <hi>Chaldee Tongue,</hi> that the
people might underſtand it, and hence came
that cuſtom of reading the verſe firſt in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi>
and then in the <hi>Chaldee,</hi> as I have ſeen
an old <hi>MS.</hi> brought from <hi>Ormus,</hi> ſo written;
Firſt the verſe in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and then the ſame in
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:115995:149"/>
the <hi>Chaldee.</hi> Nor was the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Old
Teſtament</hi> perfected before <hi>Eſdras,</hi> as it is now,
and all the Books in one Volume, or the <hi>Copies</hi>
thereof as common among the people, as the
<hi>Bible</hi> with us, (as our <hi>Author</hi> imagines) ſome
<hi>Copies</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> might remain among the
<hi>Levites</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> by which they inſtructed
the people, but the whole <hi>Canon,</hi> and all the
Books of it, reduced into one Volume as now,
I doubt he will not finde before that time; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the <hi>Copies</hi> they had were much depraved,
and had ſuffered much, (as this <hi>Author</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth)
and ſo were not fit for uſe, till they
were rectified, elſe <hi>Eſdras</hi> and the great <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue</hi>
needed not to have ſpent ſo much labour
about reſtoring the <hi>Law</hi> and other Books as
they did.</p>
               <p>XVII. As for the Teſtimonies produced, I
deny that the <hi>Eldeſt</hi> is ſix hundred years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the matter of <hi>fact,</hi> the <hi>chief evidence</hi> and
moſt reall teſtimony, is from the <hi>Coyns</hi> which
were near five hundred years before this change
was made, and for the written <hi>Teſtimonies,</hi> they
are of the ancienteſt that are extant among the
<hi>Jews,</hi> who have ſcarce any of unqueſtionable
and undoubted certainty before the <hi>Talmuds,</hi>
except the <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſes,</hi> or ſome of the
<hi>Apocryphall</hi> books, where no occaſion was given
to mention ſuch things. Theſe among other
things, were preſerved among them by <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:115995:150"/>
and had not their <hi>diſperſions</hi> and <hi>baniſhments</hi>
over the world, forced the compiling of the
<hi>Miſhna</hi> and the <hi>Talmuds;</hi> this among their
other <hi>Traditions</hi> had been loſt. After all, our
<hi>Author</hi> concludes, p. 266. <hi>ſeeing</hi> the vanity of
all that he had ſaid before, <hi>that it is probable
that the old Letters being excommunicate by</hi>
Eſdras, <hi>with the</hi> Samaritanes, <hi>laying aſide the old
Letters, becauſe of their difficulty, he, together with
the new, introduced alſo the points to facilitate
their reading.</hi> The later part of which ſpeech,
as we deny upon grounds formerly ſhewed, ſo
the other we receive, that <hi>Eſdras</hi> laid aſide the
old Letters, (not becauſe of their difficulty, for
they appeare rather to be eaſier then the other)
but becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> had been more uſed to the
<hi>Chaldee,</hi> and that they might not ſeem to have
communion with the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> (as is elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
proved) and that he brought in the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrian,</hi>
which hath ſince continued, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we need no more proof in this matter,
when we have the confeſſion of our <hi>Adverſary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XVIII. Thus I have ſhortly run over theſe
<hi>Conſiderations,</hi> and examined the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
paſſages which contained any thing
worth the obſerving, intreating the <hi>Reader,</hi> who
deſires more full ſatisfaction, to have recourſe
to the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> and <hi>Appendix</hi> themſelves.
By what hath been now obſerved, ſufficient
warning is given to the <hi>Reader,</hi> not to be too
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:115995:150"/>
credulous, or to take any thing upon truſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
examination or triall, and by theſe, <hi>Specimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
of his <hi>candor</hi> and <hi>love of truth,</hi> I deſire him
to judge of the reſt of his <hi>Diſcourſe.</hi> If he ſhall
think fit to reply, though I cannot expect he
ſhould retract any thing he hath written; for
I have known by long experience, that ſome
men, as if they had <hi>an infallible ſpirit</hi> annexed
to their Chair, are paſt acknowledging any er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
in whatſoever comes from them, yet if he
think fit to draw this Saw of <hi>contention</hi> further,
or as he threatens in diverſe places to make fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>diſcoveries,</hi> I ſhall adviſe, 1. That he
would be carefull to ſtate the controverſie tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and relate the arguments faithfully and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely,
and not lamely, much leſſe to pervert
them, and to that end as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> wiſhed,
<hi>Adverſ. errores Joh. Hieroſol. ut verbis meis ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum
meum loquatur, that he would deliver my
opinion in my own words,</hi> (as I have done his)
and not ſubſtitute what he pleaſes, or make his
own <hi>conſectaries,</hi> his adverſaries opinions.
2. That he would proceed <hi>Scholaſtically,</hi> and
keep cloſe to the point in hand, forbearing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
<hi>popular</hi> declamations. 3. That he
would lay aſide all paſſion and prejudice, for as
<hi>Ariſtotel. in Elench.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
or if he cannot but write in
haſt and in heat, yet that he would review and
weigh his own conceptions, avoiding raſh and-precipitate
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:115995:151"/>
cemures; And that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that as an account muſt be given for
every <hi>idle word</hi> ſpoken, ſo much more for what
is <hi>Written</hi> or <hi>Printed,</hi> as being done with more
<hi>deliberation.</hi> 4. That he would not joyn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly
what is ſaid by other Authors, either
<hi>Romaniſts</hi> or <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> with what is ſaid in
the <hi>Proleg.</hi> as if all that they affirm were to be
charged upon the <hi>Proleg.</hi> for by not diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what is ſaid by each, but by jumbling all
together, it is cunningly inſinuated to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary
Reader, as if all held the ſame; for I am
not to anſwer for any thing, but what's ſaid in
the <hi>Prolegomena.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIX. Theſe Rules, if he ſhall obſerve, I ſhall
promiſe to deal in like manner with him, if any
rejoynder ſhall be found needfull. But if he
ſhall perſiſt in the way he hath begun, I ſhall
think ſilence the beſt anſwer, having better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
wherein to ſpend my hours; and
ſhall reſt in the teſtimony of my own conſcience,
that I have in all my endeavours about this great
Work, propoſed no other end, then the <hi>Glory</hi>
of <hi>God,</hi> in the preſerving of his <hi>ſacred Truth,</hi>
both in the <hi>Originalls,</hi> and <hi>ancient Tranſlations,</hi>
both for the <hi>true reading,</hi> and <hi>right ſence</hi> or
meaning, <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>entire</hi> to poſterity, againſt
both the <hi>caſuall mistakes</hi> that may happen in
ſome, and the <hi>wilfull corruptions</hi> and <hi>falſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
of <hi>Sectaries</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> which never
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:115995:151"/>
more boldly nor in greater numbers then now,
endevoured to deprave or corrupt it, either in
the <hi>letter</hi> or <hi>ſence</hi> or both. And though theſe
weak endevours be attended (as it hath been the
fate of all publick works of this nature) with
<hi>obloquy</hi> in ſome <hi>emulous</hi> and <hi>contradicting</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
yet I ſhall think it ſufficient that I have
had the general <hi>approbation</hi> of men <hi>truly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
judicious</hi> and <hi>pious;</hi> And for thoſe that
are otherwiſe, I doubt not but the Work will
live in after ages, when their <hi>invectives</hi> ſhall
be burned in <hi>oblivion:</hi> For,</p>
