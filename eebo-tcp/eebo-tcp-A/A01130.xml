            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

What is this to the Apostles, and Apostolique Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters: who be called to this function, to this onely ende, to profite the congregation of Christ, and not ouerrule them, as Princes and Potentates: to nourishe and feede the flocke of their Lord, not Lordly, and loftily to ouercrowe them, as Lordes of the flocke? For their estate is not an estate of stately domination, and tyrannical superioritie, but an office, a charge, and a shepeherdes estate. And as it is a charge,<note place="margin">How the charge of a Sheape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For neither the Scholemaister may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take vpon him to ouerrule his pupilles, as Parents do their children, or as Princes their subiectes: bycause
<pb facs="tcp:16506:12"/>
his office is to instruct the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in learning: neither is he other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise worthie the place of a Schoolemaister, then in that respect that he may teach good and wholesome doctrine. In like maner, whereas the office of a godly pastor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in this onely, to direct the consciences of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, to employ all his studie and trauel to the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christes kingdome, he ought for this cause abide vnremoueable within the bounds of his charge, &amp; therein behaue himselfe as a shepeheard, not as a Lorde: as a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, not as a maister. It is one thing to beare souerain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by publike and Christian authoritie: an other thing to be a seruant, in feeding the flocke, and to be subiect to the state: And yet neither doeth this kinde of seruice want his proper and peculiar dignitie. As in all common weales the most renowmed &amp; famous actions do of their owne nature, allure the wel liking, and laudable commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the godly: So Ministers of the Church also, such as being endued with heauenly giftes of spiritual bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and the mightie power of Christ Iesus, though they groape not greedily for promotion, shall neuer yet bee destitute of their due honour and reuerence, which of it owne nature doth alwayes attend vpon and accompanie godly and famous personages: I meane not any such dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>standing, as should raise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the state of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nor make them Lordes of the earth, ne yet aduaunce them to Monarchies, nor so much as priuiledge them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> due obedience to the state, nor to the Lawes and Statutes of the higher powers.</p>

To be briefe: If to sitte in a place, bee of such efficacie and force, I suppose the temple of God be farre more honourable then the chayre of Peter.

<pb facs="tcp:16506:95"/>
when on all sides your eares doe fully conceiue the voyces of the most choyse learned fathers touching the visible meat, the bread which is broken, the wine which is crusht out of the grapes, the matter, and the substance of bread and wine: when as these so many authours whom I haue cited, do as it were thrust into your mouth bread &amp; wine: doe you notwithstanding not receyue bread nor wine? and are yee yet so poreblinde as not to see ought else here but phanatical superficiall shadowes onely, and accidents of bread? Surely that queysie stomacke of yours deserueth in my conceyte to bee continually fed with those delicate cates of accidents.</p>
            <p>But bycause I will not oppresse you with testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies I surcease here. This one thing I demaund: sithence these visible kindes whereof ye speake, doe holde yet the names of the things which they were before: I woulde faine know, whether togither with the names they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the effect and operation of the same things wherein they be sayd to feed, and to nourish, yea or nay?<note place="margin">Whether the operation of bread remaine in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment togither with the kindes and names of bread, yea or nay.</note> If ye say, yea: certes ye feed your guestes very finely, that so feede them with colours and shewes of accidents not much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, as if bycause Pepper is black, therfore a man should say it is hote in the mouth: or bycause salt is white, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it doth sauour and season victuals.</p>
            <p>But if ye say, nay, what consonancie of likenesse shal there bee betwixt the Lordes flesh and this Sacrament, which you fasten wholy to shadowes: seing that shadowes haue no force at al to refresh, &amp; withal seeing ye leaue vs no substaunce of breade wherevpon wee may feede? For what shall we say?<note place="margin">No likenesse be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>twixt the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and the body of Christ.</note> doeth not the fleshe of Christ nourish the inwarde man no more substancially, then the outward formes of bread and wine doe nourish the bodie?

For first the thing that is neither breade nor the bodie, nor a thing, but a Sacrament of a thing onely: not a creature, but the accident of a creature, nor is any substaunce at all, howe can it possibly bee, that the same thing which is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing at all, may seeme to bee a Sacrament of some one thing, and of some substaunce,<note place="margin">The visible formes cannot be the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of a double thing: to w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>The Church,</hi> sayeth he, <hi>is called one bread and one bodie.</hi> For this cause, That as one loafe of breade is made of many graynes, and as one bodie is made of many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: so the Church is vnited and knit togither of manie faythfull through the coupling or mutual knot of loue. As concerning S. Paul, the whole and natural deriuation of this similitude is deriued not from the bodie of Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> but from the bread onely. Nowe to admitte this to bee true, that there is no small resemblance betwixt the true bodie and mystical bodie of Christ: yet doth not euerie si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude make a Sacrament, though euerie Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doe conteine some certaine similitude. But from whence hath <hi>Lombarde</hi> pyked out this that he teacheth, that the true natural bodie of Christ shoulde bee the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of his mysticall bodie? Is it bycause it doeth set foorth the likenesse thereof? But there be many things in the frame of creation, that resemble eche other, yet bee they not Sacraments. If no Sacraments ought be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued into the Church, but such as the Lorde himselfe hath instituted, let <hi>Lombarde</hi> tel vs, where the Lord did euer institute or deliuer his natural bodie to bee a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of his mysticall bodie. Moreouer, when hee hath shewed it, howe shall hee honestly auoyde as great an absurditie, to witte, to clogge the Church with eight Sacraments of verie necessitie?<note place="margin">Eight Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hatcht out of <hi>Lombards</hi> diuinitie.</note> For if the Church bee possessed of sixe Sacramentes, besides the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Eucharist, and that out of the same Sacrament of Eucharist also two other Sacraments doe spring vp: the one whereof must bee a visible forme conteyning and signifying both the true and mysticall bodie of Christ: the other muste bee the verie naturall bodie, which must beare the expresse ymage of his mysticall bodie: then muste it needes followe, that by this meanes the Churche shall bee enlarged with eight Sacraments.</p>

            <p>We doe not therfore extenuate heere the singuler and incomprehensible power of Christ in working myracles: so also neither are myracles to be newe coyned where no myracles bee nowe: Forasmuche as myracles are wrought not for the behoofe of the beleeuing persons properly, but in respecte of the vnbeleeuers, nor are at any time vsually frequented, but for some great and vrgent causes, or some notable necessitie, too strike a

Namely, sithens neither the Apostles did neede any suche myracle, being already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore established in faith: yea though they had needed it, yet did the Lorde very grauely forewarne them, that his fleshe shoulde not profite them any whit at all? More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer neyther was any of them carried into any amazed admiration, or straunge adoration of any thing doone by the Lord in that Supper. Besides this also neither do any of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Euangelistes make report of any myracle wrought heere, but doe describe the maner and story of the action simply, without al astonishment of the beholders. And by what faith I praye you may wee conceaue in our mindes a myracle of hidden transubstantiation, where no thing appeareth too any mans sight that we may wonder at, where no degree of a myracle may eyther appeare to the senses, or bee comprehended by reason?

            <p>For as much therefore as the matter is come to this passe:<note place="margin">An exhortation to the Pope.</note> and that your tottering state standeth in worse case nowe than any man can expresse: what better prouision may you make for your selfe, or what more wholesome counsel may I giue vnto you, then that ye reclaime your selfe speedily, and returne againe betimes? Whither shal I returne, wil you say? Returne, Romane ruffler, from whence you are fallen. Returne to humilitie, to the which you bee called. Returne againe vnto the charge wherevnto you are appoynted. If the Lorde haue cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led you into his Uineyarde, hee hath called you to toyle and labour, not to scrape riches togither: to ministerie and submission, not to maistrie and soueraintie. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe cost, and dresse the Lordes vineyarde therefore, doe not spoyle and moyle the Uineyarde. For it is no Uineyarde of yours, which though were your owne, yet ought you not roote and turne it vp with such boarishe sauagenesse. For it is the Lordes Uineyarde and not yours: Who if haue waged you amongest other his woorkemen, returne therefore to your worke, and holde you contented with your place, and vaunte not your Peacockes taile more than becommeth your plumes: and be satisfied with your penie, whether you come in the first houre, or the last houre of the day: one kinde of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is due to euerie woorkeman alike. There is no prerogatiue amongest woorkemen. The Lordes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity
<pb facs="tcp:16506:116"/>
is extended to al alike. Therfore if you be wise, let your Romain Sea content you, bicause you are placed in Rome: and permit others that be ouerseers ouer others, to gouerne their owne prouinces. And would God the Lorde woulde once vouchsafe imprint such an heart in you, as might earnestly &amp; seriously ponder these things, and that you might returne from whence you are fallen. The time was when this your Citie of Rome was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and noble, replenished with most woorthy woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers of Christ: adorned with excellent wittes and most commendable conuersation of life: notably mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified with the blood of glorious martyrs: most aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly flourishing with godly and learned Bishops: who employed all their industrie and endeuour to none other ende, then to the publique peace and tranquilitie of the Church.</p>
            <p>Restore againe this peace vnto vs (holy father) if you may, and this you may easily doe, if yee wil depart from that proude primacie, which you nowe stande vpon altogether agaynst all Gods lawe, agaynst all mans lawe, and quite contrarie to the example of all the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fathers.

You doe see how wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly and treacherously the Pope of Rome &amp; his deere dearlinges the Cardinalles, haue not only raked vp that kingdome, which they doe most iniuriously deteigne, but also to what end and with what affection they maintein the same at this present, not that truth may raigne, but that true religion may be brought to nought.

If this could be obteyned of them with their good willes, nothing could be more honourable: But for as much as we may not so much as hope for any such thing at their handes: the remedy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of reboundeth back vnto you, chiefly and aboue others to you that are princes, that euery of you according to your auncient generositie, authoritie, and pietie, doe first paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this troubled estate of religion within your owne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, restore that which is crazed and ruinous, and reforme that which is defiled and corrupte. Next it toucheth you that be Bishops and Pastours, that euery of you direct your particular flock carefully, soundly, and godly towardes the kingdome of God. Last of all, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth you that be subiectes, that euery of you doe duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledge your humble obedience to your owne Princes and Magistrates in the Lorde.</p>
