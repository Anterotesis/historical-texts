            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THAT the Reader may be satisfied, how it came to pass, that an History wrote of, and by, a Person of so great a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter in this Nation, and by him designed for the Publick, hath lain hid, and been suppressed for near Fifty Years; through whose Hands it hath passed; and by what means, and by whose Labour it is at last Published; he may be pleased to take the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Account.</p>
            <p>The Most Reverend Arch-Bishop, the Author and Subject of this History, was very exact and careful in keeping all Papers, which concerned himself, or any Affairs of Church and State, passing through his Hands; not only kept a Journal of his own Actions, but from time to time, took minutes of whatsoever passed at Council-Table, Star-Chamber, High-Commission-Court, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Digested all his Papers in most exact Order; wrote with his own Hand on the back or top of every one, what it Concerned, when it was Received, when Wrote or Answered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This his Enemies knew full well; and therefore, when after they had caused him to be Impeached of High Treason, of endeavouring to introduce Popery and Arbitrary Government, and to be Imprisoned upon the Impeachment in the end of the Year, <hi>1640.</hi> and had now in vain laboured for two Years and an half, to find out Evidence to prove this their Accusation; but the more they sought, they found to their confusion, so much the greater Evidence of the contrary: After they had in vain ransacked all Papers left by the Arch-Bishop in his Study at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and Examined all his Intimate Friends and subaltern Agents upon Oath; when nothing did appear, they hoped to find somewhat against him, either in his private <hi>Journal</hi> of his Life, which they knew to be kept by him, or in those Papers, which he had carried with him from <hi>Lambeth</hi> at his first Commitment, in order to his future Defence. Vpon these hopes, they with great privacy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> an Order, for the searching his Chamber and Pockets in the Tower, in <hi>May 1643.</hi> and committed the Execution of it, to his inveter ate Enemy, <hi>William Prynne;</hi> who thereupon took from the Arch-Bishop Twenty One Bundles of Papers, which he had prepared for his Defence; his Diary, his Book of Private Devotions, the <hi>Scotch</hi> Service-Book, and Directions accompanying it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And although he then faithfully promised Restitution of them within three or four days, yet never restored any more than three Bundles; employed such against the Arch-Bishop at his Trial, as might seem prejudicial to his Cause; suppressed those, which might be advantageous to him; Published many, Embezzeled some; and kept the rest to the day of his Death.</p>
            <p>As soon as <hi>Prynne</hi> was possessed of the Arch-Bishop's Papers, he set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with eager Malice to make use of them to his Defamation, and to prove the charge of Popery and abetting Arbitrary Government, by the Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many of them. His first Specimen in this kind, was a Pamphlet, which
<pb facs="tcp:54614:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
came out in <hi>August</hi> following, Entituled, <hi>Rome's Master-piece,</hi> in Five Sheets in Quarto, containing the Papers and Letters relating to the Plot, contrived by <hi>Papists</hi> against the Church and State then Established in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and discovered by <hi>Andreas ab Habernfeild.</hi> But never did Malice appear so gross and ridiculous together, as in this case. For from this Plot, if there were any Truth in it, it appeared, that the Life of the Arch-Bishop was chiefly aim'd at by the Plotters, as the grand Obstacle of their Design, and one who could by no Arts be wrought to any connivance of them, much less concurrence with them. This Pamphlet being, after the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it, carried to the Arch-Bishop in the <hi>Tower,</hi> he made several Marginal Annotations on it, in Answer to <hi>Prynne's</hi> Falsifications and Malitious Calumnies intermixed therein. Which Copy, coming afterwards into the Hands of Dr: <hi>Baily,</hi> the Arch-Bishop's Executor, was by him given to the Learned Antiquary, Mr: <hi>Anthony Wood,</hi> and by him Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to me, in order to be placed among the other Papers and Memorials, which are to follow this History, according to the Arch-Bishop's own Direction.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Prynne's</hi> Malice could not be abated by the shame of one Miscarriage. In the next place, he bethought himself of Publishing the Arch-Bishop's <hi>Diary,</hi> as soon as his Trial ended, wherein it had been often produced as Evidence against him. This then he Published in the beginning of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, 1644.</hi> in Nine Sheets in Folio, with this Title, <hi>A Breviat of the Life of, &amp;c.</hi> (intending it, as he saith, <hi>for a Prologue to the much desired History of his Tryal</hi>) but neither entire, nor faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as far as he did Publish it; but altered, mangled, corrupted, and glossed in a most shameful manner; accompanied with <hi>desperate Untruths,</hi> as the Arch-Bishop complains in this History; and therefore addeth: <hi>For this Breviat of his, if God lend me Life and Strength to end this</hi> (History) <hi>first; I shall discover to the World, the base and malitious Slanders, with which it is fraught.</hi> This the Arch-Bishop wrote, when he despaired that ever his <hi>Diary</hi> should be recovered out of those vile Hands, in which it then was; and be Published faithfully and entirely, which would be the most effectual discovery of the Baseness and Malice of <hi>Prynne</hi> therein.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding so vile and corrupt an Edition of it, all those who have wrote any thing of this Excellent Prelate, have been forced to make use of it; not being able to gain the sight of the Original, nor perhaps so much as suspecting any such fraud in the Edition of it. Particularly, it is much to be lamented, that Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> who wrote the <hi>History of the Arch-Bishop's Life</hi> with great Care and Elegance, was forced, in most things, to borrow his Account from this corrupted Edition of his <hi>Diary,</hi> and hath thereby been led into many and great Errors. Others also have, since him, taken up and divulged many false Opinions concerning the <hi>Diary</hi> it self; as that it was wholly wrote in <hi>Latin</hi> by the Arch-Bishop, that it was by himself Entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>A Breviat of his Life,</hi> and that it was Translated and Published entire <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Prynne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The True and Faithful Publication of it, which I have made from the Original, now in my Hands, will not only supply the defect of what the Arch-Bishop intended in the words before related, but never effected; but will also undeniably assert his Innocence from those greater Accusations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb facs="tcp:54614:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Aspersions of lesser moment. I will name but one, which is to be found in the Life of Arch-Bishop <hi>Williams,</hi> wrote by Bishop <hi>Hacket,</hi> and lately Published: Therein <hi>(pag. 63, 64.)</hi> Dr. <hi>Laud</hi> is taxed of high Ingratitude against <hi>Williams,</hi> who is there in a long Relation represented as his great Benefactor, and who particularly gained of King <hi>James</hi> the Bishoprick of St. <hi>Davids</hi> for him, by his great and restless importunity, when the King had determined not to Promote him, as unworthy of his Favour, for Reasons there expressed. I question not Bishop <hi>Hacket's</hi> Veracity, or that Arch-Bishop <hi>Williams</hi> did indeed relate this to him. But then <hi>Williams</hi> will be found strongly to have prevaricated, when he pretended that <hi>Laud</hi> owed that Preferment to his Kindness, and thereupon taxed him of Ingratitude. For from what is related in the following <hi>Diary,</hi> at <hi>June 29 1621.</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears indeed, that <hi>Williams</hi> stickled hard to gain the Bishoprick of St. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> for <hi>Laud,</hi> not out of any Kindness to him, but for his own ends, that so himself might retain the Deanry of <hi>Westminster,</hi> with the Bishoprick of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> (to which he was then Nominated) which otherwise had slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from him; the King having designed to give it to Dr. <hi>Laud,</hi> upon the avoidance of it by the Promotion of Dr. <hi>Williams</hi> to the See of <hi>Lincoln.</hi> But whatever may be in this Matter alledged against Dr. <hi>Laud;</hi> I am sure, no Art or Colour can defend that bitter Revenge of Arch-Bishop <hi>Williams,</hi> related in this History; which prompted him to move earnestly in the <hi>House of Lords,</hi> that the Jurisdiction of the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> (then a Prisoner in the <hi>Tower</hi>) might be Sequestred, and put into the Hands of his Inferiour Officers; which by his importunity he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, to the great Prejudice of the Church, and no small Infamy of himself.</p>
            <p>I do not pretend to justifie the whole Proceeding of Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> during the whole course of his Power and Government, against Arch-Bishop <hi>Williams.</hi> I do rather lament it, as the great Misfortune, both of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and the Church at that time; that two such Eminent Prelates, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endued with extraordinary Learning, Wisdom, and Greatness of Mind, should be engaged in constant Opposition and Enmity to each other, at first raised by mutual Distrust and Emulation, and ever after kept up and fomented by reciprocal Injuries, and false Representations on each side. But that the blame of this Misfortune should be cast wholly on the one side; that unworthy Reflections should be made and Published in prejudice of Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud;</hi> that he should be accused of base Ingratitude, of impotent Malice, of insa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable Revenge; while the other is represented as the most Calm, most Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and most Heroical Person imaginable; I cannot without some Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion observe in the before mentioned Historian, otherwise of Eminent Worth and Character; who to approve his Gratitude to his Patron and Promoter, hath grosly neglected the Laws of History; and cared not how injuriously he treated the Memory of Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> that he might justifie the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, and heighten the Encomium of Arch-Bishop <hi>Williams.</hi> Vpon this <note place="margin">

            <p>I had intended to have said no more upon this Head. But I cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with my self to pass by an heinous Accusation, formerly brought against Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> concerning his having altered the Oath Administred to King <hi>Charles I:</hi> at his Coronation, in favour of the Crown, and prejudice of the People. Which Accusation, it hath pleased an Honourable, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend, <note place="margin">L. C.

            <p>I might farther add, that the entire Publication of this <hi>Diary,</hi> contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes very much to Illustrate the History of those Times; and that both it, and the following <hi>History,</hi> discover many Secrets (before unknown) in Matters of Church and State, and correct many Errours, commonly taken up and received in Relation to either.

<pb facs="tcp:54614:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
appears from what the Arch-Bishop hath wrote in his <hi>Diary</hi> at <hi>Dec. 5. 1639.</hi> that the first movers for calling a Parliament at that time, were the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> and himself. Nothing also can reflect more Honour upon the Memory of any Person, that what the Arch-Bishop (in the following History, <hi>cap. 9.)</hi> relateth of the Earl's rejecting the unworthy Proposition made to him, by Mr. <hi>Denzell Hollis,</hi> in the Name of the Leading Men of the <hi>House of Commons;</hi> a matter wholly unknown before.</p>
            <p>But to proceed with <hi>Prynne,</hi> soon after the Martyrdom of the Arch-Bishop, whether prompted by his unwearied Malice, or by his eternal itch of scribling, or incited by the Order of the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> made <hi>March 4. 1644/5. desiring him to Print and Publish all the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings concerning the Arch-Bishop of</hi> Canterbury's <hi>Trial:</hi> He immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately set himself to Defame the Arch-Bishop, and justifie the Proceedings of the Rebel Parliament against him, more at large. To which purpose, he Published in <hi>1646.</hi> in <hi>66</hi> Sheets in <hi>Folio,</hi> his <hi>Necessary Introduction to the History of the Arch-Bishop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>his Trial:</hi> Which in the Preface, he calleth <hi>A New Discovery of sundry Plots, and hidden Works of Darkness:</hi> Containing bitter Invectives and Accusations against the whole Proceedings of the Court, from the time of the Treaty about the <hi>Spanish</hi> Match, to that day; and labouring to prove, that both King <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> designed to overthrow the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Religion, and to introduce Popery, using Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> as their chief Instrument in that bad Design: An Accusation, which neither himself, nor any other Man in his Wits, ever believed.</p>
            <p>Soon after this, in the same Year <hi>1646.</hi> was Published by the same Author, <hi>Canterbury's Doom, or the First Part of a compleat History of the Trial of the Arch-Bishop,</hi> in <hi>145</hi> Sheets in <hi>Folio,</hi> containing (as himself <note place="margin">Epist: Ded.</note> acknowledgeth) only the History of the Preliminaries of the Trial till the commencement of it, <hi>together with the</hi> Commons <hi>Evidence, his Answers to it, and their Replies upon him, in maintenance of the first general Branch of their Charge of High Treason against him, to wit, his Trayterous endeavours to alter and subvert God's True Religion by Law Established among us, to introduce Popery, and to reconcile the Church of</hi> England <hi>to the Church of</hi> Rome. The remaining part of the Trial he engaged (by Promise <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rushworth</hi> also promised to Publish such an exact Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Trial of this Arch-Bishop, as he had done of that of the Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> Collect. Par. 3. vol. 2. pag. 833. but never did ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it.</note> made both in the beginning and end of that Book) <hi>to Compleat and Publish with all convenient speed;</hi> but never made good his Vndertaking; nor, as I believe, ever did intend it. For he well knew, that however what was urged against the Arch-Bishop at his Trial in this matter, and was largely amplified in his <hi>History,</hi> in proof of the Arch-Bishop's endeavour to subvert the Established Religion, carried with it some shew of Truth in the Judgment of a then miserably deluded People; who were cheated into a Belief (cursed be the wilful Authors of that Cheat, which in great measure yet continueth) that good Works, Building, Repairing, Consecrating and Adorning Churches, bowing at the Name of Jesus, prosiration to God in Prayer, wearing Copes, retaining the use of Canonical Hours in Prayer, and such like Decent Vsages and Ceremonies, were downright Popery (for these and such like were the Proofs of that Accusation brought against the Arch-Bishop) Yet that all which they did or could produce in confirmation of their other Heads of Accusation against the Arch-Bishop, carried not with it the least appearance of proof. For which Reason, <hi>Prynne</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:54614:6"/>
began the <hi>History</hi> of his <hi>Trial</hi> with the Charge and Proofs of Popery; although that was not the first, but the last, Head of Accusation, brought against him, and canvassed in the course of his Trial.</p>
            <p>However, the Godly Cheat, once begun, was by any means to be continued; and therefore it was pretended by <hi>Prynne,</hi> and other Adversaries of the Arch-Bishop; that although, <hi>to give him his due</hi> (for such are <hi>Prynne's</hi> own words, <hi>pag. 462.) the Arch-Bishop made as full, as gallant, as pithy a Defence of so bad a Cause; and spake as much for himself, as was possible for the Wit of Man to invent; and that with so much Art, Sophistry, Vivacity, Oratory, Audacity and Confidence, without the least acknowledgment of Guilt in any thing, &amp;c.</hi> yet that after all, the Crimes objected being undeniably proved against him; and himself there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon despairing of being able to justifie and clear his Innocence, either to the then present or to succeeding times, <hi>did burn all the Notes of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers and Defence before his Death, of purpose to prevent their publication after it.</hi> Which Calumny <hi>Prynne</hi> hath twice (in <hi>Epist. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic.</hi> and <hi>pag. 461.</hi>) repeated, pretending to have received the knowledge of it from the Arch-Bishop's own Secretary Mr. <hi>Dell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The falsity of this base Report appears sufficiently from this <hi>History,</hi> wrote by the Arch-Bishop, and now Published. He had begun to compose it before the end of the Year <hi>1641.</hi> and continued it from time to time, till the 3d of <hi>January 1644/5.</hi> which was the seventh day before his Execution. For on the 4th of <hi>January,</hi> being acquainted that Sentence had passed upon him in the <hi>House of Lords,</hi> he conveyed the Original Copy of his <hi>History</hi> into safe hands, and prepared himself for Death. That he had begun it before the end of <hi>1641.</hi> and augmented it from time to time; appears evidently from several places of it. And although in the Narration of his <hi>Trial,</hi> many things said or alledged in the Recapitulation on the last days, be interwoven with the History of every days Trial; yet all those passages were added by him afterwards on the blank pages, which he had for that purpose left over-against every written page in the Original Copy; and from thence were according to his directions transcribed in the other Copy into one entire Narration. Hence it comes to pass, (which the Reader will easily observe) that the Arch-Bishop writing down the Transactions of every day, as they happened, hath left so many plain Indications of haste, and sometimes of heat. Some things seem to have been wrote, while his Spirits had not yet recovered a sedate Temper; many improprieties of Language committed; and other defects admitted: which the Arch-Bishop himself being sensible of, had wrote in the first leaf of his Book: <hi>Non apposui manum ultimam. W. Cant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the most Reverend Author wrote this <hi>History</hi> for the publick Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of himself, cannot be doubted. Nay himself more than once affirmeth, that he intended it for the Vindication of himself to the whole <hi>Christian</hi> World; and chiefly indeed for the defence of himself and the Church of <hi>England</hi> in Foreign parts; where wrong Notions are generally entertained of the Constitution of our Church, as being for the most part taken from the Writings of some <hi>Puritanical</hi> Divines among us. For this Reason the Arch-Bishop earnestly desired (which desire is thrice in this Work expressed) that it might be carefully and exactly Translated into <hi>Latin,</hi> and Printed; that he might thereby appeal <hi>to the Judgment of the Learned in all parts of Christendom.</hi> To this end himself had procured the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:54614:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he had composed for the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be turned into <hi>Latin,</hi> that it might be Published with it. <hi>To the end</hi> (saith he) that the <hi>Book may be extant, and come to the view of the Christian World, and their Judgment of it be known, I have caused it to be exactly Translated into Latin; and if right be done me, it shall be Printed with this History.</hi> This <hi>Latin</hi> Translation of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Liturgy, as also the <hi>English</hi> Original Copy of the first draught of it, are now in my Hands; and shall one or both of them be hereafter (God willing) published in the <hi>Collection</hi> of Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials. It should seem, that when the Arch-Bishop designed a <hi>Latin</hi> Edition of his <hi>History,</hi> he despaired that the generality of this Nation, then miserably di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper'd in Matter of Religion, would ever so far regain the use of their Wits, as to be able to pass an impartial Judgment upon his Cause. But, God be thanked, the Church, for which he suffered, and which was ruined with him, was in a short time after beyond hope Re-established; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Sobriety returning into the minds of Men, no place is now so fit for the publication of this <hi>History,</hi> as our own Island; and no Language more proper for it, than our own, which is the Original, wherein it was wrote.</p>
            <p>It should seem, that what was already wrote of this <hi>History,</hi> in <hi>May 1643.</hi> when <hi>Prynne</hi> searched the Arch-Bishop's Chamber in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and seized his Papers found there, escaped his ravenous Hands. Whether after the <hi>Arch-Bishop's</hi> death, and the completion of it, the Copy of it came into his hands, I cannot certainly affirm (the Reason of my uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty I shall relate presently) but do believe, that it did. Which if it did, I suppose he having got notice of it, seized it by Vertue of an Order of the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> March <hi>4. 1644/5.</hi> empowering him <hi>to send for all Writings, &amp;c.</hi> relating to the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> his <hi>Trial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To proceed, all the Arch-Bishop's Papers taken from him by <hi>Prynne,</hi> either out of his Study at <hi>Lambeth</hi> soon after his Commitment, or out of his Chamber and Pockets in the <hi>Tower,</hi> or seized after his Martyrdom, remained in <hi>Prynne's</hi> hands until his Death. When Arch-Bishop <hi>Sheldon,</hi> well knowing that the Papers of his Predecessor Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> had been unjustly seized and detained by him; procured an Order of the King and Council, deputing Sir <hi>William Dugdale,</hi> and some others, to view his Study, and taking thence all the Books and Papers formerly belonging to Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> to deliver them into his hands. This was accordingly done; and the Books and Papers being seized, brought to Arch-Bishop <hi>Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> although very much diminished in number, and embezeled, since they had come into <hi>Prynne's</hi> hands. For he seems either to have Printed many of them from the Originals, to save the labour of transcribing them; or to have burned them, or otherwise employed them to common uses, when once Printed. So that very few of those Papers, which <hi>Prynne</hi> had published in the several Pamphlets and Books before named, came into Arch-Bishop <hi>Sheldon's</hi> hands. And not a few, even of those which had not been Publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were found wanting. Particularly the Papers of Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> concerning the Conversion of his Godson, Mr. <hi>William Chillingworth;</hi> which the Arch-Bishop saith were taken away from him by Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> and being by him produced at the Committee for drawing up his Charge, were there Examined.</p>
            <p>Whether the Copy of this <hi>History</hi> was seized at this time in Mr. <hi>Prynne's</hi> Study, or came to Arch-Bishop <hi>Sheldon</hi> by other means, I cannot certainly
<pb facs="tcp:54614:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
affirm. But this I am assured of, that Arch-Bishop <hi>Sheldon</hi> having about this time got into his Hands the Copy of this <hi>History,</hi> and having now gained also the other Papers of Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud;</hi> sent for the truly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend and Learned Dr. <hi>William Sancroft,</hi> then Dean of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and delivered both to him; ordering him to Publish the History, with such Papers as were necessary to it, with all convenient speed. This Dr. <hi>Sancroft</hi> willingly undertook; but upon Reading of the <hi>History,</hi> found the <hi>Copy</hi> to be so very vitious; that it would not be sit to be Published, till the Original might be recovered, whereby the defects of it might be supplied and corrected. Hereupon they set themselves to search after the <hi>Original;</hi> which at last they found in St. <hi>John's</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi> having been deposited there (as I suppose) by Dr. <hi>Richard Baily,</hi> formerly President of that Colledge, and Executor to the Author.</p>
            <p>After this was done, a new scruple was started concerning the Language, wherein it should be Published. Arch-Bishop <hi>Sheldon</hi> was desirous it might be Translated into, and Published in <hi>Latin,</hi> in complyance with the Desire and Intention of the Author. The Dean of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> on the other side was of Opinion; that it would be more useful to the Publick, and serviceable to the Memory of the Author, to Publish it in <hi>English.</hi> This difference of Opinion protracted the Edition of it from time to time; until at last Arch-Bishop <hi>Sheldon</hi> continuing resolved in his Opinion, the Dean yielded to his Authority; and only desiring that some Learned <hi>Civilian</hi> might be joyned with him, who might render the Forms of Pleading in apt <hi>Latin</hi> Expressions, prepared himself for the undertaking. But in the <hi>interim</hi> Arch-Bishop <hi>Sheldon</hi> dying, the Dean was most deservedly chosen to succeed him in the Arch-Bishoprick. Whereby being involved in constant Publick Business both of Church and State, he was forced to lay aside his design of publishing this History, yet not without hopes of finding at some time or other opportunity to perform it: for which Reason he devolved not the care of it upon any other; but kept it by him, and in the mean time endeavoured to get into his Hands all other Papers relating to Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> or his Cause.</p>
            <p>But in vain did he hope to find so much leisure, while the Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the chief Office in the Church took up his whole care and thoughts. What he could not then do, he hoped to accomplish after his Retirement into <hi>Suffolk,</hi> in <hi>August 1691.</hi> Yet neither then did he set about it, until the middle of the Year <hi>1693.</hi> when opening his Papers, he began to collate the <hi>Copy</hi> with the <hi>Original,</hi> to divide the History into Chapters, to examine the Citations, to write down several Directions and <hi>Memoranda's</hi> for his own use in preparing the Edition, to Note what places deserved to be amended or considered, to write several Observations on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, to draw up a Catalogue of the Memorials to be added as an <hi>Appendix</hi> to the History, to Note which of them were in his Hands, and which being wanting to him, were to be sought elsewhere.</p>
            <p>He was earnestly employed about this Matter; and the <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>Copy,</hi> with many of the Papers belonging to it, lay on his Scrutoire before him; and himself was then writing certain <hi>Quaeries, Memoranda's</hi> and <hi>Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> for his use therein in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

As soon as he had Reason to apprehend, that his Sickness would prove mortal; remembring what he was last employed about, the Edition of this History, he was desirous to see me, that so he might commit the care of it to me. But so it was, that I hearing of his Sickness, and not knowing any thing, either of this <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> being in his Hands, or of his Intentions about it, took a Journey into <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> to wait upon him, as in Duty bound, (having the Honour and the Happiness to be his Chaplain) whither I came on the last day of <hi>October.</hi> He was then pleased to acquaint me with his Design; related to me, how the <hi>History</hi> with the other Papers of Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> came into his Hands, how he had often prepared himself for the perfection of this Edition, and was at last hindred by his present Sickness. In fine, he laid his Commands upon me, to perfect what he had begun, and to Publish the <hi>History,</hi> as soon as might be; and then immediately caused to be delivered to me the Original and Copy of the <hi>History,</hi> with the <hi>Diary,</hi> and all other Papers of Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> or his own, relating to them, which then laid upon or about his Scrutoire, or could be found in his Study. His Voice was then very weak, and his Spirits faint; so that he could not give to me that perfect account, by what means the Copy came into Arch-Bishop <hi>Sheldon's</hi> Hands, which I had desired of him. For he having omitted to tell me that distinctly, and I desiring satisfaction in that and some other Questions about this Book; he could only answer me: <hi>These are material Questions; but I am weary with speaking, and my Spirits are faint. I cannot make to you any farther Answers herein.</hi> After which, I never presumed to trouble him with the Question.</p>
            <p>However, having observed, upon Reading the Book, and looking over the Papers, that many even of those Memorials were wanting, which I found that my Most Reverend Patron had in his written Notes marked to be in his Hands; I took the boldness, when I next waited on him (on <hi>November 22.</hi> following) to acquaint him with this defect. Whereupon, he immediately or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me to search all his Papers, (the greater part of which had not been opened, nor put in order, since his removal from <hi>Lambeth</hi>) which I began forthwith to do; and thereby found many Papers relating to this <hi>History,</hi> or other Papers of Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> scattered and divided among several parcels of other Writings. But before I had searched half way, evident signs of approaching Death appearing in him, I quitted the search at that time; and renewed it not again, till several weeks after his Death; when I looked over the remaining part of his Papers, and, with the leave of his Executors, took thence whatsoever related to, or might be subservient to this Design.</p>
            <p>In this latter search I found many things; but neither first nor last could find several Papers of Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> of great moment; which I am well assured were in the Hands of my late Lord Arch-Bishop <hi>Sancroft;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I find them testified so to be in the Catalogue of Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud's</hi> Papers in his hands, drawn by himself. Among these, is a large Answer of Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> to a Speech made by <hi>William</hi> Lord Viscount <hi>Say and Seal</hi> against the Civil Power of Bishops, and Printed by him, <hi>London, 1642.</hi> His Answer to the Speech of the same Lord against the Liturgy, and Printed <hi>London 1641.</hi> I found, and have published in the end of this Volume; as well because it contains many Historical passages of the Arch-Bishop's own
<pb facs="tcp:54614:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Life and Actions; as for that, it is no where referred to in this <hi>History,</hi> and so could not well be placed among the Memorials intended for the Second Part. Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> had also wrote a large and elaborate Answer to the Speech of <hi>Nathaniel Fiennes,</hi> Son to the Lord <hi>Say,</hi> against the new Canons, made in the end of the Year <hi>1640.</hi> and Printed <hi>London, 1641.</hi> which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to in this <hi>History.</hi> This also was in the Hands of my late Lord Arch-Bishop <hi>Sancroft;</hi> as I find as well by the written Catalogue before mentioned, as by a particular Paper of Observations made by him upon it, toward the completion and illustration of it; whereby it appears to consist of above fifty Pages in <hi>Folio.</hi> But this, after a tedious and diligent search, I could not find. Which will not appear incredible to those, who know what a vast multitude of Papers and Collections my late Lord Arch-Bishop <hi>Sancroft</hi> left behind him; and therein more perhaps wrote with his own Hand, than any Man, either of this or the last Age, ever did write.</p>
            <p>Having obtained all the Papers, which could be found, I set my self to perfect the Edition of this History; which I have at last performed, yet with greater trouble and labour, than can easily be imagined. I caused the <hi>Diary</hi> to be exactly Transcribed, adjoined an <hi>English</hi> Translation to the <hi>Latin</hi> part of it, diligently collated the Copy of the <hi>History</hi> with the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, the Articles and other Memorials with the Printed Copies, if any such were; added what Observations I thought necessary, in the Margin; have every where Religiously retained the Author's own words and expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons throughout, (although therein, I must confess, against the Judgment of my most Reverend Patron expressed in his written Notes) have only amended the Orthography (which both in Original and Copy was monstrously vitious) inserted some words, where the Sense was imperfect, but have always included such in Crotchets; and in some places substituted <hi>Greek</hi> words instead of <hi>Latin,</hi> in Citations out of <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers or Authors. So that the Reader may be assured, this <hi>History</hi> is faithfully conveyed to the Publick.</p>
            <p>I have retained all my late Lord Arch-Bishop <hi>Sancroft's</hi> Observations, whether wrote in the Margin of the Book, or elsewhere, if considerable; sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning to them the Letters: <hi>W: S: A: C:</hi> I have subjoined to many of my own Observations of greater moment, the Letters, <hi>H. W.</hi> And where Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> had added any thing in the Margin, I have adjoyned the Letters, <hi>W: C:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Collection of Memorials and other Papers, which by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Direction should have accompanied this <hi>History;</hi> finding that they could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> be Published in the same Volume without swelling it to too great a bulk; I have reserved them for a Second Part; and (if God grant me Life and Health) will cause them shortly to follow; and therewith give to the Publick what farther Account of them I shall then judge necessary.</p>
            <p>The Originals, both <hi>Diary</hi> and <hi>History,</hi> I intend at my Death to leave to St: <hi>John's</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi> where the Authour the Arch-Bishop was bred, to which place he ever bore so great a Love, and where his Body now remaineth. Which Intention of mine I chose here to mention; that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> to be admitted to accompany a Work of such a publick Nature;
<pb facs="tcp:54614:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yet I cannot forbear to say, that it is an inexpressible satisfaction to me, that in the Edition of this Work, I have been able to serve the Illustrious Author of it, and my most Reverend Deceased Patron, and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> at the same time: And more particularly, that I account it the most Fortunate Transaction of my whole Life, to have contributed herein to the vindication of the Memory and the Cause of that most Excellent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and Blessed Martyr, to whom I have always paid a more especial Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ever since I was able to form any Judgment in these matters; as firmly believing him to have taken up and prosecuted the best and most effectual Method (although then in great measure unsuccessful, through the malignity of the Times) and to have had the Noblest, the most Zealous, and most sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Intentions therein, towards Re-establishing the Beauty, the Honour, and the Force of Religion, in that part of the Catholick Church (the Church of <hi>England</hi>) to the Service of which I have entirely devoted my Life, my Labours, and my Fortunes.</p>

                        <hi>March</hi> 29. <hi>Easter-Munday,</hi> I went and acquainted my Lord <hi>Keeper,</hi> with what I had said to my Lord Duke. He approved it, and said it was the best Office that was done for the Church this Seven Years. And so said my Lord of <hi>Durham.</hi> They perswaded me to go and acquaint my Lord's Grace (of <hi>Canterbury</hi>) with what I had done. I went. His Grace was very angry. Asked, what I had to do to make any Suit for the Church. Told me, never any Bishop attempted the like at any time, nor would any but my self have done it. That I had given the Church such a wound, in speaking to any Lord of the Laity about it, as I could never make whole again. That if my Lord Duke did fully understand what I had done; he would never indure me to come near him again. I answered: I thought I had done a very good Office for the Church; and so did my Betters think. If his Grace thought otherwise, I was sorry I had offended him. And I hoped, being done out of a good Mind, for the support of many poor Vicars abroad in the Country, who must needs sink under Three Subsidies in a Year, my Error (if it were one) was pardonable. So we parted.</p>
                     <p>I went to my Lord Duke, and acquainted him with it; lest I might have ill Offices done me for it, to the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Prince.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>I ascended the Pulpit, much troubled, and in a very melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly moment, the Report then spreading, that his Majesty King <hi>James,</hi> of most Sacred Memory to me, was Dead. Being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with the dolours of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> I broke off my Sermon in the middle.</p>
                        <p>The King died at <hi>Theobalds,</hi> about three quarters of an hour past Eleven in the forenoon. He breathed forth his Blessed Soul most Religiously, and with great constancy of Faith, and Courage.</p>
                        <p>That day, about five a Clock, Prince <hi>Charles</hi> was Solemnly Proclaimed King. God grant to him a Prosperous and Happy Reign.</p>
                        <p>The King fell Sick, <hi>March,</hi> 4. on <hi>Friday.</hi> The Disease appeared to be a Tertian Ague. But I fear it was the Gout, which by the wrong application of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, was driven from his feet to his inward vital parts.</p>
                        <p>April 1. <hi>Friday,</hi> I received Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> Lord Chamberlain to the King, and therein a Command from his Majesty King <hi>Charles,</hi> to Preach a Sermon before himself

                        <p>The same day I received in Command, to go to the Right Reverend the Bishop of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> and learn from him, what he would have done in the Cause of the Church; and bring back his Answer, especially in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Five Articles,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                           <hi>June</hi> 6. I wrote an Answer next Morning.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54614:21"/>
It was ill weather, and the day cloudy. When they came by the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London</hi> (for they came by water instead of Coach) the King led out the Queen to the outside of the Barge, that she might see the People and the City. But at the same time, a violent shower of Rain falling down, forced them both to return into the inward part of the Barge. The shower continued, until they had entred <hi>White-Hall;</hi> and then ceased.</p>

                           <hi>June</hi> 18. <hi>Saturday,</hi> The first Parliament of King <hi>Charles,</hi> which had been so often put off, now began. There were present at the opening of it, the Duke of <hi>Shiveruz,</hi> with other <hi>French</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen; a Bishop also, who At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Queen. For fear of the Pestilence, which then began to be very rife, the King omitted the pomp usual upon that day, lest the great conflux of People should be of ill consequence. And the Sermon, which had been imposed upon me to be Preached in <hi>Westminster</hi> Abbey at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Session, was put off to the next day, that is, to</p>

                           <hi>June</hi> 24.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54614:22"/>
and also to beg the Divine Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing upon the Fleet now ready to put to Sea. The Bishops were <hi>Lond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Durham, Winchester, Norwich, Rochester,</hi> St. <hi>Davids.</hi> This was done.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>June</hi> 25. <hi>Saturday,</hi> All the Bishops, who were then in Town, were introduced together, that they might wait upon Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and kiss her Hand. She received us very Graciously.</p>

                           <hi>July</hi> 2. <hi>Saturday,</hi> The Fast was kept by both Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to set an Example therein to the whole Kingdom.</p>

                           <hi>July</hi> 3. Sunday, in my Sleep his Majesty King <hi>James</hi> appeared to me. I saw him only passing by swiftly. He was of a pleasant and serene Countenance. In passing he saw me, beckned to me, smiled, and was immediately withdrawn from my Sight.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>July</hi> 7. <hi>Thursday, Richard Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague</hi> was brought into the <hi>Lower House</hi> of Parliament, &amp;c.</p>

                           <hi>July</hi> 9. <hi>Saturday,</hi> it pleased his Majesty King <hi>Charles,</hi> to intimate to the <hi>House of Commons;</hi> that what had been there said and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, without consulting him, in <hi>Montague's</hi> Cause, was not pleasing to him.</p>

I went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Country, to the House of my good Friend <hi>Francis Winde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank.</hi> In going thither, <hi>Richard Montague</hi> met me by chance. I was the first, who certified him of the King's Favour to him.</p>

                           <hi>July</hi> 15. <hi>Friday,</hi> I went to <hi>Windsor;</hi> and performed some Businesses committed to my trust by the Right Reverend Bishop of <hi>Durham.</hi> I returned that night. The Court was there at that time.</p>

I Dined: Afterwards I Eat in the House of the Bishop of <hi>Glocester.</hi> Baron <hi>Vaughan</hi> was there present, with his Eldest Son. The next day one of the Bishops Servants, who had waited at Table, was seized with the Plague. God be merciful to me and the rest.

                           <hi>Aug.</hi> 21. <hi>Sunday.</hi> I Preached at <hi>Brecknock;</hi> where I stayed two days, very busie in performing some Business.</p>
                        <p>That Night, in my Sleep, it seemed to me, that the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> came into Bed to me; where he behaved himself with great kindness towards me, after that Rest, wherewith wearied Persons are wont to solace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Many also seemed to me to enter the Chamber, who saw this.</p>
                        <p>Not long before, I dreamed that I saw the Dutchess of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> that Excellent Lady, at first very much perplexed about her Husband, but afterwards chearful, and rejoycing, that she was freed from the fear of Abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so that in due time she might be again a Mother.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Aug.</hi> 24. <hi>Wednesday,</hi> and the Festival of St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> I came safely (thanks be to God) to my own House at <hi>Aberguille.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though my Coach had been twice that day overturned between <hi>Aber-Markes</hi> and my House. The first time I was in it; but the latter time it was empty.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Aug.</hi> 28. <hi>Sunday,</hi> I Consecrated the Chappel or Oratory, which I had built at my own charge in my House, commonly called <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guilly-House.</hi> I Named it the Chappel of St. <hi>John Baptist,</hi> in grateful remembrance of St. <hi>John Baptist's</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi> of which I had been first Fellow, and afterwards President. And this I had determined to do. But another thing intervened (of no ill <hi>Omen</hi> as I hope) of which I had never thought. It was this. On <hi>Saturday,</hi> the Evening immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately preceeding the Consecration, while I was intent at Prayer, I know not how, it came strongly
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54614:23"/>
into my mind, that the day of the Beheading of St. <hi>John Baptist</hi> was very near. When Prayers were finished; I consulted the Calendar. I found that day to fall upon <hi>Munday,</hi> to wit, the 29th of <hi>August,</hi> not upon <hi>Sunday.</hi> I could have wished, it had fallen upon that same day, when I Consecrated the Chappel. However, I was pleased, that I should perform that solemn Consecration at least on the Eve of that Festival. For upon that day, his Majesty King <hi>James</hi> heard my Cause about the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Presidentship of St. <hi>John's</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi> for three hours together at least; and with great Justice delivered me out of the hands of my powerful Enemies.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Septemb.</hi> 4. <hi>Sunday,</hi> The Night following I was very much troubled in my Dreams. My Imagination ran altogether upon the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and Family. All seemed to be out of order: that the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chess was ill, called for her Maids, and took her Bed. God grant better things.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Septemb.</hi> 11. <hi>Sunday,</hi> I Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Carmarthen,</hi> the Judges being then present. The same Night I Dreamed, that Dr: <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odore Price,</hi> admonished me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Ma:</hi> 3. and that he was unfaithful to me, and discovered all he knew: and that I should therefore take heed of him, and trust him no more, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Afterwards I dreamed of <hi>Sackville Crow,</hi> that he was dead of the Plague, having not long before been with the King.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Septemb.</hi> 24. One only Person desired to Receive Holy Orders from me; and he found to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, upon Examination.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="24" facs="tcp:54614:24"/>
                           <hi>Septemb.</hi> 25. I sent him away with an Exhortation, not Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It was then <hi>Saturday.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Septemb.</hi> 26. <hi>Sunday,</hi> That Night I dreamed of the Marriage of I know not whom at <hi>Oxford.</hi> All that were present, were cloathed with flourishing green Garments. I knew none of them, but <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Flaxnye.</hi> Immediately after, without any intermission of Sleep, (that I know of) I thought I saw the Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> his Head and Shoulders covered with Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen. He advised and invited me kindly, to dwell with them, mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out a place, where the Court of the Marches of <hi>Wales</hi> was then held. But not staying for my Answer, he subjoyned, that he knew I could not live so meanly, &amp;c.</p>

                           <hi>Octob.</hi> 8. <hi>Saturday,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> President of <hi>Wales,</hi> returned out of <hi>Wales,</hi> taking his Journey by Sea.</p>

                           <hi>Januar.</hi> 1. <hi>Sunday,</hi> I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, that I was Named among other Bishops, who were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult together on <hi>Wednesday</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> concerning the Ceremonies of the Coronation. I was also at the same time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that the bigger part of the Bishop of <hi>Durham's</hi> House was appointed for the Residence of the Ambassadour Extraordinary of the King of <hi>France.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <hi>Januar.</hi> 2. <hi>Munday,</hi> I returned to <hi>Hains-Hill.</hi> For there, not then knowing any thing of these Matters, I had left my necessary Papers with my Trunk. When I had put these in order; I went to Sir <hi>Richard Harrison's</hi> House, to take leave of my Friends. There (if I mistake not) I first knew, what <hi>F. H.</hi> thought of me. I told my mind plainly, &amp;c. I returned.</p>

                           <hi>Januar.</hi> 3. <hi>Tuesday,</hi> I came to <hi>London,</hi> and fixed my self at my own House at <hi>Westminster.</hi> For the week before <hi>Christmas</hi> I had sent my Servant, who had brought all my things out of the House of

my good Friend the Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi> (with whom I had abode as a Guest for Four Years com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat) to my own House, save only my Books; the removal of which, I unadvisedly put off till my own coming. For the coming of the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadour forced me to make over-much haste; and the multitude of business then laying upon me, made it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, that I should have my Books at hand. In the Evening I visited the Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <hi>Januar.</hi> 4. <hi>Wednesday,</hi> We met at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> to consult of the Ceremonies of the Coronation. I sent my Servant to bring my Books, who brought them. That Night I placed them in order in my Study. And it was high time. For while we were in consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about the Ceremonies, the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> Lord Chamberlain of the Houshold to his Majesty, came from the King to us, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to me the King's Order, to be ready against the sixth day of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> to Preach that day at the opening of the Parliament.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Januar.</hi> 6. <hi>Friday, Epiphany</hi> day, We met again, to consult con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Ceremonies; and gave up our Answer to the King.</p>

The Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> made known to me the King's Pleasure, that at the Coronation I should supply the place of the Dean of <hi>Westminster.</hi> For that his Majesty would not have the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> then Dean, to be present at the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. It was then <hi>Munday.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The same day, by the King's Command, a Consultation was held, what was to be done in the Cause of <hi>Richard Montague.</hi> There were present, the Bishops of <hi>London, Durham, Winchester, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> and St. <hi>Davids.</hi>

                           <hi>Januar.</hi> 17. <hi>Tuesday,</hi> We gave in our Answer in Writing, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed this day. This day also, the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> deputed me under his Hand and Seal, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the place for him, which he, as Dean of <hi>Westminster,</hi> was to Execute in the Coronation of King <hi>Charles.</hi>

                           <hi>Januar.</hi> 18. <hi>Wednesday.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> brought me to the King, to whom I shewed my Notes, that if he disliked any thing therein, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The same day, by the King's Command, the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Cant.</hi> and the Bishops of <hi>London, Durham, Winchester, Rochester</hi> and St. <hi>Davids,</hi> consulted together concerning a Form of Prayer, to give Thanks for the decrease of the Plague.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Januar.</hi> 23. I had a perfect Book of the Ceremonies of the Coronation made ready, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all things with the Kings Book. It was <hi>Munday.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <hi>Januar.</hi> 29. <hi>Sunday,</hi> I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood what <hi>D. B.</hi> had collected concerning the Cause, Book, and Opinions of <hi>Richard Montague,</hi> and what <hi>R. C.</hi> had determined with himself therein. Methinks, I see a Cloud arising, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Church of <hi>England.</hi> God of his Mercy dissipate it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Januar.</hi> 31. <hi>Tuesday,</hi> The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and other Peers before nominated by the King to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult of the Ceremonies of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation, that the ancient Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner might be observed, by his Majesties Command went toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to him. The King viewed all the <hi>Regalia;</hi> Put on St. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward's</hi> Tunicks; Commanded me to read the Rubricks of direction. All being read, we carried back the <hi>Regalia</hi> to the Church of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> and laid them up in their place.</p>
                        <p>

                           <hi>Febr.</hi> 2. <hi>Thursday</hi> and <hi>Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> day, His Majesty King <hi>Charles</hi> was Crowned. I then officiated in the place of the Dean of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster.</hi> The King entred the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by-Church a little before Ten a Clock; and it was past Three, before he went out of it. It was a very Bright Sun-shining Day.</p>
                        <p>The Solemnity being ended, in the great Hall at <hi>Westminster,</hi> when the King delivered into my hands the <hi>Regalia,</hi> which are kept in the Abby-Church of <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> he did, (which had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been done) deliver to me the Sword called <hi>Curtana,</hi> and two others, which had been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before the King that day, to be Kept in the Church, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the other <hi>Regalia.</hi> I returned, and Offered them So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly at the Altar in the Name of the King, and laid them up with the rest.</p>
                        <p>In so great a Ceremony, and amidst an incredible concourse of People, nothing was lost, or broke, or disordered. The Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre was clear, and free for the King, the Peers, and the Business in hand; and I heard some of the Nobility saying to the King in their return, that they never had seen any Solemnity, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though much less, performed with so little Noise, and so great Order.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Febr.</hi> 6. <hi>Monday,</hi> I Preached before King <hi>Charles</hi> and the House of Peers, at the opening of the Parliament.</p>

In the Convocation held that Day, there was much debating concerning the Sermon which <hi>Gabriel Goodman</hi> Bishop of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi> had Preached before the King on the <hi>Sunday</hi> preceding, being the fifth <hi>Sunday</hi> of <hi>Lent.</hi>

                           <hi>April:</hi> 5: <hi>Wednesday,</hi> The King sent in the Morning, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Bishops of <hi>Norwich, Litch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feild,</hi> and St: <hi>Davids,</hi> to attend him. I and the Bishop of <hi>Litch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feild</hi> waited upon him; the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Norwich</hi> being gone into the Country.

Sunday</hi> in <hi>Lent</hi> last past. We advised together, and gave this Answer to the King; That some things were therein spoken less cautiously, but nothing falsely; That nothing was innovated by him in the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> That the best way would be, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop should preach the Sermon again, at some time to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen by himself, and should then shew, how, and wherein he was misunderstood by his Auditors. That Night after 9. a Clock, I gave to the King an account of what I had received in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand on the <hi>5th.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> and of other things relating thereto. Among the rest, concerning resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Impropriations.

                           <hi>April</hi> 20. <hi>Friday,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> referred the Cognisance of that whole matter, as also of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the Earl of <hi>Digby,</hi> to the House of Parliament.</p>

Then his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty chid us, that in this time of Parliament we were silent in the Cause of the Church, and did not make known to him what might be Useful, or was Prejudicial to the Church; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing himself ready to promote the Cause of the Church.</p>
                        <p>He then commanded us, that in the Causes of the Earl of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol</hi> and Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> we should follow the direction of our own Consciences, being led by Proofs, not by Reports.</p>

He seemed to me in very good plight, and merry enough. I told him, what I had done for his Widow and Children. He, after a little thought, answered; That the Executor had satisfied him for those Legacies, while he was yet alive. And presently looking upon some Papers in his Study adjoyning, he added, that it was so.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Aug.</hi> 4. That very Morning, at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> there came one to me, Seriously, and that avowed ability to perform it, and offered me to be a Cardinal: I went presently to the King, and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him both with the Thing and the Person.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aug.</hi> 7. <hi>Wednesday,</hi> An absolute Settlement between me, and <hi>K. B.</hi> after I had made known my Cause at large. God bless me in it.</p>

                        <hi>Aug.</hi> 17. <hi>Saturday,</hi> I had a serious offer made me again to be a Cardinal: I was then from Court, but so soon as I came thither (which was <hi>Wednesday Aug.</hi> 21.)

                        <hi>Sept.</hi> 18. When I first went to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> my Coach, Horses and Men sunk to the bottom of the <hi>Thames</hi> in the Ferry-Boat, which was over-laden, but I Praise God for it, I lost neither Man, nor Horse.</p>
                     <p>A wet Summer, and by it a Casual Harvest. The Rainy Weather continuing till <hi>Novemb:</hi> 14. which made a marvellous ill Seed-time. There was Barley abroad this Year, within 30: Miles of <hi>London,</hi> at the end of <hi>October.</hi>

                        <hi>Novemb.</hi> 13. <hi>Wednesday, Richard Boyer,</hi> who had formerly named himself <hi>Lodowick,</hi> was brought into the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> for most grosly Misusing me, and Accusing me of no less than Treason, &amp;c. He had broke Prison for Felony, when he did this. His Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is upon Record. And God forgive him.</p>
                     <p>About the beginning of this Month the Lady <hi>Davis</hi> Prophesied against me, that I should very few Days out-live the Fifth of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And a little after that, one <hi>Green</hi> came into the Court at St. <hi>James's,</hi> with a great Sword by his Side, swearing, the King should do him Justice against me, or he wou'd take another course with me. All the wrong I ever did this Man, was, that being a poor Printer, I procured him of the <hi>Company</hi> of the <hi>Stationers</hi> 5 <hi>l.</hi> a Year during his Life. God preserve me, and forgive him. He was committed to <hi>Newgate.</hi>

                        <hi>Novemb.</hi> 24. <hi>Sunday</hi> in the After-noon I Christened King <hi>Charles</hi> his Second Son, <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> at St. <hi>James's.</hi>

                        <hi>Decemb.</hi> 10. and 29. Twice or Thrice in the Interim, I adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised his Majesty of the Falsehood and Practice that was against me, by <hi>L. T.</hi> &amp;c. This brake out then.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Junij</hi> 11. Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> sent me a very Libellous Letter, about his Censure in the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> for his <hi>Histriomastix,</hi> and what I said at that Censure; in which he hath many ways mistaken me, and spoken untruth of me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Junij</hi> 16. I shewed this Letter to the King; and by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand sent it to Mr. Atturney <hi>Noye.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Junij</hi> 17. Mr. Atturney sent for Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> to his Chamber; shewed him the Letter, asked him whether it were his hand. Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi> said; he could not tell, unless he might read it. The Letter being given into his hand, he tore it into small pieces, threw it out at the Window, and said, that should never rise in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against him: Fearing, it seems, an <hi>Ore tenus</hi> for this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Junij</hi> 18. Mr. Atturney brought him, for this, into the <hi>Star-Chamber;</hi> where all: this appear'd with shame enough to Mr. <hi>Prynn.</hi> I there forgave him, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Aug.</hi> 11. One <hi>Rob: Seal</hi> of St: <hi>Albans,</hi> came to me to <hi>Croydon;</hi> told me somewhat wildly about a Vision he had at <hi>Shrovetide</hi> last, about not Preaching the Word sincerely to the People. And a Hand appeared unto him, and Death; and a Voice bid him go tell it the Metropolitan of <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and made him swear he would do so; and I believe the poor Man was over-grown with Phansie. So I troubled not my self further, with him, or it.</p>

Methoughts I wondred to see him (for I left him sick at home) and asked him, how he did, and what he made there. And that he answered me, he came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve my Blessing; and with that fell on his knees. That hereupon I laid my Hand on his Head, and Prayed over him, and therewith awaked. When I was up, I told this to them of my Chamber; and added, that I should find <hi>Pennell</hi> dead or dying. My Coach came; and when I came home, I found him past Sense, and giving up the Ghost. So my Prayers (as they had frequently before) commended him to God.</p>

against the Arch-Bishop at his Trial. For in the following <hi>History,</hi> at <hi>March:13: 1643.</hi> The Arch-Bishop saith. <hi>I know into whose Hands my Book is fallen; but what hath been done with it, I know not. This is to be seen; some passages in that Book are half burnt out; whether purposely, or by chance, God knoweth.</hi> And the like words of the Arch-Bishop occur afterwards, at <hi>July: 29: 1644. That passage</hi> (of <hi>Febr: 11: 1640.</hi> urged against the Arch-Bishop out of his <hi>Diary</hi>) <hi>is more than half burnt out; as is to be seen; whether of purpose by Mr:</hi> Prynne, <hi>or casually, I cannot tell; yet the passage as confidently made up, and read to your Lordships, as if nothing were wanting.</hi> It is indeed undeniably evident to any one, who compareth the Original with <hi>Prynne's</hi> Printed Copy; that this Accident had befallen the Book, before <hi>Prynne</hi> had caused it to be Transcribed for the Press. Yet he taketh no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it; but filleth up the places with such Words, as himself pleaseth; and publisheth the whole without any distinction of his own Additions. I have partly from <hi>Prynne,</hi> partly from my own conjecture, supplied the muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated places, as well as I could; but have included all such suppletory Words in Crotchets; that so the Reader may easily distinguish those Words, which are yet to be Read in the Original, from those which are not; and may judge, whether the several places be aptly filled up.</p>

Consequence. Upon this I was made the Author of [them,] and a Committee put upon me to enquire into all my Actions, [and] to prepare a Charge.</p>
                     <p>The same Morning, in [the] Upper House, I was na [med as an] Incendiary by [the <hi>Scot</hi>] <hi>tish</hi> Commissioners; and [a ....] Complaint promised to [be drawn up] to morrow.</p>

                        </note> for High Trea [son, without] any particular [Charge] laid against me; [which they] said, should be [prepared] in convenient time. [Mr. <hi>Denzell</hi>] <hi>Hollys</hi> was the [Man that brought] up the Message [to the Lords. Soon] after, the Charge [was brought into] the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-House [by the <hi>Scottish</hi>] Commissioners, [tending to prove me an [<hi>Incendiary.</hi>] I was presently [committed to] the Gentleman Us [her; but was permitted] to go in his Company [to my House at <hi>Lam</hi>] <hi>beth,</hi> for a Book or two to Read in, and such Papers, as pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to my Defence against the <hi>Scots.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I stayed at <hi>Lambeth</hi> till the Evening, to avoid the gazing of the People. I went to Evening Prayer in my Chappel. The <hi>Psalms</hi> of the day, <hi>Psal.</hi> 93, and 94. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 50. of <hi>Esai,</hi> gave me great Comfort. God make me worthy of it, and fit to receive it.</p>
                     <p>As I went to my Barge, hundreds of my poor Neighbours stood there, and prayed for my safety, and return to my House. For which I bless God and them.</p>

                        <hi>Decemb.</hi> 21. <hi>Munday,</hi> I was Fined 500 <hi>l.</hi> in the Parliament House, and Sir <hi>John Lambe</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Martin</hi> 250 <hi>l.</hi> a piece, for keeping Sir <hi>Robert Howard</hi> close Prisoner in the Case of the Escape of the Lady Viscountess <hi>Purbecke</hi> out of the <hi>Gate-House;</hi> which Lady he kept avowedly, and had Children by her. In such a Case, say the Imprisonment were more than the Law allow; what may be done for Honour and Religion sake? This was not a Fine to the King, but Damage to the Party.</p>
                     <p>[<hi>Decemb.</hi> 23.] <hi>Wednesday,</hi> The Lords Ordered me to pay the Money presently; which was done.</p>
                     <p>[<hi>Januar.</hi> 21.] <hi>Thursday,</hi> A Parliament [Man] of good Note, and Interessed [with] divers Lords, sent me word, [that] by Reason of my patient [and m]oderate Carriage since my [Commit]ment, four Earls of great [power] in the Upper-House [of] the Lords were not [now] so sharp against me [as at] first. And that now they [were] resolved only to Se [quester] me from the King's Coun [cil, and] to put me from my [Arch-]Bishoprick. So I see, what Justice I may expect; since here is a Resolution taken, not only before my Answer, but before my Charge was brought up against me.</p>

These Generals they craved time to prove in particular. The Copy of this General Charge is among my Papers. I spake something to it.

The same day, after the [King] was gone, a Letter was [Read] in the Upper-House from the <hi>Scots;</hi> in which, they did earnestly desire to be gone.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54614:43"/>
(he said) to do me service in a great particular; and prefaced it, that he was not set on by any States-Man, or any of the Parliament. So he drew a Paper out of his Pocket, and shewed me 4. Articles drawn against me to the Parliament, all touching my near conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation with Priests, and my Endeavours by them to subvert Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>England.</hi> He told me, the Articles were not yet put into the House: they were subscribed by one <hi>Willoughby,</hi> who (he said) was a Priest, but now come from them. I asked him, what Service it was he cou'd do me. He said; he looked for no advantage to himself. I conceived hereupon, this was a piece of Villany: And bad him tell <hi>Willoughby,</hi> he was a Villain; and bid him put his Articles into the Parliament, when he will. So I went presently into my inner Chamber; and told Mr: <hi>Edward Hide,</hi> and Mr: <hi>Richard Cobb,</hi> what had befallen me. But after I was sorry at my Heart, that my Indignation at this base Villany made me so hasty, to send <hi>Hunt</hi> away; and that I had not desir'd Mr: Lieutenant to seize on him, till he brought forth this <hi>Willoughby.</hi>

                        <hi>Hollis,</hi> second Son to <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Clare,</hi> by Order from the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> came up to the <hi>Lords,</hi> and Accused me of High Treason; and told the Lords, they would make proof thereof in convenient time: But desired in the mean time, that I might be committed to safe Custody. This was strange News to my Innocency: For this I can say of my self, without falshood or vanity, that to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of my Understanding, I served the <hi>King,</hi> my Gracious Master, with all Duty and Faithfulness; and without any known or wilful Disservice to the State there-while. And this I did, with as true and free a Heart, as ever any Man did, that served a <hi>King.</hi> And I thank God, my care was such for the Publick, that it is well known, I much neglected my own private Fortunes there-while. The more was I amazed at the first apprehension of this heavy and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served Charge.</p>
                     <p>Upon this Charge, I was commanded to withdraw. But I first desired leave to speak a few words: And I spake to this effect; That I was heartily sorry for the Offence taken against me; and that I was most unhappy, to have my <hi>Eyes</hi> open to see that day, and mine <hi>Ears</hi> to hear such a Charge: But humbly desired their Lordships, to look upon the whole course of my Life, which was such, as that I

did verily perswade my self, not one Man in the House of <hi>Commons</hi> did believe in his Heart, that I was a Traytor. Here my Lord the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> interrupted me, and said, <hi>That Speech of mine, was a Scandal put upon the whole House of</hi> Commons, <hi>that they should</hi>

                        </note> of the <hi>Black Rod,</hi> to be kept in safe Custody, till the House of <hi>Commons</hi> should farther Impeach me.</p>
                     <p>Here I humbly desired leave, that I might go home to fetch some Papers, necessary for my Defence. This was granted me with some difficulty; and Mr. <hi>Maxwell</hi> was commanded to Attend me all the while I should stay. When I was gone to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> after some little discourse (and sad enough) with my Steward, and some private Friends, I went into my Chappel to Evening Prayer. The <hi>Psalms</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal: <hi>93. &amp; 94. In vulgara Editione,</hi> Ps. <hi>92, &amp; 93.</hi>
                        </note> for that day gave me much comfort, and were observed by some Friends then present, as well as by my self. And upon the Comfort I then received, I have every day since (unless some urgent Business prevented me) Read over both these <hi>Psalms,</hi> and, God willing, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose so to do every day of my Life. Prayers being ended, I went with Mr. <hi>Maxwell,</hi> as I was commanded; Hundreds of my Poor Neighbours standing at my Gates to see me go, and Praying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>AND because here I am sure to find my self, being now Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned; I will begin farther off, and shew briefly why, and how, this Malignity pursued, and overtook me.</p>
                     <p>When I was first Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> His <hi>Majesty</hi> expressed a great desire, which he had, to settle a <hi>Liturgy</hi> in the Church of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and this continued in agitation many Years. And what my part was therein, I shall clearly and ingenuously set down hereafter, when I come to Answer the <hi>Scottish</hi> Accusations of me in that behalf, or the <hi>Articles of the Parliament</hi> here, one of which relates to them. In the Year 1633. His <hi>Majesty</hi> went into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and was Crowned there; I attended his <hi>Majesty</hi> in that Service. The <hi>Parliament</hi> then sitting in <hi>Scotland,</hi> was very quick about some Church Affairs; and the King was much unsatisfied with some Men, and their Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. At his Majesty's Return, in the same Year, I was, by his special Grace and Favour, made Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> 19 <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tembris.</hi> The debate about the <hi>Scottish Liturgy</hi> was pursued a-fresh; and at last it was resolved by the <hi>King,</hi> that some <hi>Scottish</hi> Bishops should draw up a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> as near that of <hi>England</hi> as might be; and that then his <hi>Majesty</hi> would have that Confirmed and Setled for the use of that Kingdom. This <hi>Liturgy</hi> was carefully considered of, and at last Printed and Published, <hi>An.</hi> 1637. It seems, the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> which were trusted with this business, went not the right way, by a <hi>General Assembly,</hi> and other Legal Courses of that <hi>Kingdom.</hi> But what way soever was taken, or in whomsoever there was a failure; this was certain in the Event: The <hi>Bishops</hi> were deceived in their expectation of a peaceable admission of that <hi>Service-Book;</hi> The <hi>King</hi> lost the Honour and Safety of that Settlement; And that <hi>Kingdom</hi> such a Form of God's Service, as I fear they will never come near again. And that <hi>People,</hi> by cunning and factious practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, both at home and from hence, were heated into such a Phrensie, as will not easily be cured. And 'tis well, if we their Neighbours run not mad for Company.</p>
                     <p>These violent Distempers continued from the Publishing of this <hi>Service-Book,</hi> in the Year 1637. till the Year 1638. Then they grew up into a formal Mutiny: And the <hi>Scottish</hi> Subjects began to Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Arms, in their Mouths first, and soon after in their Hands. His <hi>Majesty</hi> was often told, that these <hi>Northern</hi> Commotions had their Root in <hi>England.</hi> His <hi>Majesty's</hi> Goodness was confident upon the Fidelity of his Subjects of both <hi>Nations,</hi> and would not believe that of either, which was most true of a powerful Faction in both: Till at last, after much intercourse and mediation lost, and cast away, the <hi>King</hi> was so betray'd by some of his own <hi>Agents,</hi> that the <hi>Scots</hi> appeared upon their <hi>Borders</hi> in a formal Army. <hi>His Majesty</hi> went with an Army to <hi>Barwick.</hi> There, after some stay, a <hi>Pacification</hi> was made; and his <hi>Majesty</hi> returned to <hi>White-Hall, Aug.</hi> 3. 1639.</p>

                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:54614:50"/>
Now during all this time, from the Publishing of this <hi>Service-Book,</hi> to this <hi>Pacification,</hi> I was voyced by the Faction in both <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> to be an <hi>Incendiary,</hi> a Man that laboured to set the two <hi>Nations</hi> into a bloody War: Whereas, God knows, I laboured for Peace so long, till I received a great check for my labour. And particularly at the beginning of these <hi>Tumults,</hi> when the Speech of a War first began in the Year 1638. openly at the <hi>Council-Table</hi> at <hi>Theobalds,</hi> my Counsels alone prevailed for Peace, and Forbearance, in hope the <note place="margin">See this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the King's own Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony, in his large <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> p: <hi>420.

                        <hi>Scots</hi> would think better of their Obedience. But their Counsels were fomented to another end, as after appeared.</p>

Approve the Acts of the pretended <hi>General Assembly</hi> at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> for many Grave and Weighty Considerations, which have happened, both before, and since, much importing the Honour, and Security of that true Monarchical Government Lineally descended upon Us from so many of Our Ancestors; Yet such is Our Gracious Pleasure, That notwithstanding the many disorders committed of late, We are pleased, not only to confirm, and make good, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Our Commissioner hath granted and promised in Our Name; But also, We are further Graciously pleased, to declare and assure, That according to the Petitioner's humble desires, all Matters Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical shall be determined by the Assemblies of the Kirk, and Matters Civil by the Parliament, and other inferiour Judicatories Established by Law; which accordingly shall be kept once a Year, or as shall be agreed upon <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>This <hi>Pacification</hi> was not much sooner made by the <hi>King,</hi> than it was broken by the <hi>Scots.</hi> For whereas it was agreed by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth <hi>Article,</hi> and is repeated in the Body of the <hi>Pacification; That every one of his Majesties good Subjects shou'd enjoy their Liberty, Lands, Houses, Goods, and Means whatsoever, taken, and detayned from them since the aforesaid time,</hi> The * <hi>Lord Lindsay</hi> in the Name of the rest made a Protestation either in the <hi>Camp</hi> at <hi>Dunns,</hi> or at the <hi>Cross</hi> in <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> that no <hi>Bishop,</hi> or <hi>Clergyman</hi> was included in this <hi>Pacificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> which yet in manifest and plain Terms, extended it self to <hi>all the Kings good Subjects.</hi> And this Protestation was so pursued, as that it obtained; and no <hi>Clergyman</hi> was relieved in any the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                     <p>Upon this and other Particulars agitated in <hi>Parliament</hi> amongst them, his <hi>Majesty</hi> thought fit to look to himself, and examine their Proceedings farther. To this end he often called his <hi>Council;</hi> and in particular, made a <hi>Committee of eight,</hi> more particularly to attend that service. They were the Lord Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> then Lord Treasurer, the Lord Marquis <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> Lord Admiral, the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Lord <hi>Cottington,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Windebanck</hi> Secretaries, and my self; to which was after added the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> Lord Marshal. And though I spake nothing of these <hi>Scottish</hi> Businesses, but either o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly at <hi>Council-Table;</hi> or in presence of all, or so many of this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,</hi> as occasionally met, and so had Auditors and Witnesses e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of what I did or said; yet it was still cast out among the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that I was a chief <hi>Incendiary</hi> in the Business: Where yet, had I said or done any thing worse than other, there wanted not Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> to discover it.</p>
                     <p>At this <hi>Committee</hi> many things were proposed diversly, for the Aid and Assistance of the <hi>King;</hi> and many Proposals rejected as Illegal. At last the Lord <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> propos'd the calling of a <hi>Parliament.</hi> Much was not said against this, but much said for it: Nor indeed was it safe for any Man to declare against it, after it was once publickly moved. So a <hi>Parliament</hi> was resolved on, and called against <hi>April</hi> 13. 1640. At that time it sat down, and many Tumultuary Complaints were made by the <hi>Scots</hi> against the Bishops and Church Government in <hi>England,</hi> and with great vehemency a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my self. All this while the <hi>King</hi> could get no Money, to Aid him against the <hi>Scottish</hi> Rebellion. At last, after many Attempts, Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> told the <hi>King</hi> plainly, that it was in vain to expect longer, or to make any other overture to them. For no Money wou'd be had against the <hi>Scots.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hereupon his <hi>Majesty</hi> called all his Lords of <hi>Council</hi> together; and upon <hi>Maij</hi> 5. being <hi>Tuesday</hi> at Six in the Morning they met in the <hi>Council-Chamber.</hi> I, by the mistake of the Messenger, was warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be there at Seven in the Morning (as if need be, I can prove by sufficient Witness) and at that Hour I came. By this accident I
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54614:51"/>
came late, and found a Resolution taken, to Vote the dissolution of that <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the Votes entred upon; my Lord <hi>Cottington</hi> being in his Speech, when I came into the Council-Chamber. All Votes concurred to the ending of that <hi>Parliament,</hi> save two. The Persons dissenting, were the Earls of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi> I co-operated nothing to this breach, but my single Vote: Yet the very next day, <hi>Libels</hi> were set up in divers parts of the City, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating and calling together <hi>Apprentices</hi> and others, to come and meet in St. <hi>George's</hi> Fields, for the Hunting of <hi>William the Fox,</hi> for the <hi>Breach of the Parliament.</hi> This setting up of <hi>Libels,</hi> and anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the baser People continued. I acquainted his <hi>Majesty</hi> and the <hi>Council</hi> with it. But upon <hi>Munday</hi> night following, being <hi>May</hi> 11. Five Hundred of them came about my House at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> to offer it and me violence. By God's Merciful Providence, I had some Jealousie of their intent; and before their coming, left the best Order I could to secure my <hi>House;</hi> and by the Advice of some Friends, went over the water, and lay at my Chamber in <hi>White-Hall</hi> that Night, and some other following. So, I praise God, no great hurt was done. One young Fellow only had a little hurt with a Dag, who was after taken and Executed. Thus you see, how the malignity of the Time fastned and continued upon me. For this <hi>Libelling,</hi> in a very base and most unworthy manner, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued against me. But not one of them charged me with any one Particular, save the breaking of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> of which I was not guilty.</p>
                     <p>During this <hi>Parliament,</hi> the Clergy had agreed in <hi>Convocation,</hi> to give his <hi>Majesty</hi> six Subsidies, payable in six Years: which came to Twenty Thousand Pound a Year, for six Years; but the Act of it was not made up. His Majesty, seeing what lay upon him, and what fears there were of the <hi>Scots,</hi> was not willing to lose these Subsidies; and therefore thought upon the continuing of the <hi>Convocation,</hi> though the <hi>Parliament</hi> were ended; but had not opened those Thoughts of his to me. Now, I had sent to dissolve the <hi>Convocation</hi> at their next sitting; haste and trouble of these businesses making me forget, that I was to have the <hi>King's</hi> Writ for the <hi>Dismissing,</hi> as well as the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening</hi> of it. Word was brought me of this from the <hi>Convocation-House,</hi> while I was sitting in <hi>Council,</hi> and his <hi>Majesty</hi> present. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, when the <hi>Council</hi> rose, I moved his <hi>Majesty</hi> for a <hi>Writ.</hi> His <hi>Majesty</hi> gave me an unlooked for reply: Namely, that he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have the <hi>Subsidies,</hi> which we had granted him; and that we should go on with the finishing of those <hi>Canons,</hi> which he had given us power under the Broad Seal of <hi>England</hi> to make. And when I replyed, it would be excepted against in all likelyhood by divers, and desired his <hi>Majesty</hi> to Advise well upon it: The <hi>King</hi> Answered me presently; That he had spoken with the Lord <hi>Keeper,</hi> the Lord <hi>Finch,</hi> about it, and that he assured him it was Legal. I confess, I was a little troubled, both at the difficulties of the Time, and at the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer it self; that after so many Years faithful Service, in a business concerning the <hi>Church</hi> so nearly, his <hi>Majesty</hi> would speak with the Lord <hi>Keeper,</hi> both without me, and before he would move it to me:
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54614:52"/>
And somewhat I said thereupon, which pleased not; but the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars I do not well remember. Upon this, I was Commanded to sit, and go on with the <hi>Convocation.</hi> At first, some little <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>lege</hi> Question was made.</note> Exception was taken there, by two or three of the <hi>Lower House</hi> of <hi>Convocation,</hi> whether we might sit or no. I acquainted his <hi>Majesty</hi> with this doubt; and humbly besought him, that his <hi>Learned Council,</hi> and other Persons of Honour, well acquainted with the Laws of the Realm, might deliver their Judgment upon it. This his <hi>Majesty</hi> Graciously approved; and the Question was put to them. They answer'd, as followeth under their Hands.</p>

                     <p>This Judgment of these great <hi>Lawyers,</hi> setled both Houses of <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> So we proceeded according to the Power given us under the Broad-Seal, as is required by the <hi>Statute</hi> 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 19. In this <hi>Convocation</hi> thus continued, we made up our <hi>Act</hi> perfect for the gift of six Subsidies, according to Ancient Form in that behalf, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered it under Seal to his <hi>Majesty.</hi> This passed <hi>Nemine Refragante,</hi> as may appear <hi>apud Acta.</hi> And we followed a President in my Lord Arch-Bishop <hi>Whitgift's</hi> time, <hi>An.</hi> 1586, who was known to be a Pious and a Prudent Prelate, and a Man not given to do boisterous things against the <hi>Laws</hi> of the Realm, or the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of the Crown; but one, that went just and fair ways to both. Nor did this Grant lye dead and useless; for divers <hi>Processes</hi> are yet to be seen, for the fetching in of that which was so Granted to the <hi>Queen's</hi> use, in case any Man refused payment.</p>
                     <p>Together with this <hi>Act for Subsidies,</hi> we went on in deliberation for certain <hi>Canons,</hi> thought necessary to be added, for the better Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and more setled Peace of the <hi>Church,</hi> which began to be much disquieted by the proceedings of some Factious Men (which have since more openly and more violently shewed themselves.)

                        <hi>Godfrey Goodman</hi> Lord Bishop of <hi>Glocester,</hi> who was startled at the first <hi>Canon,</hi> about the Proceedings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Papists.</hi> This <hi>Canon</hi> is very express for the use of all good and Christian means, to bring them out of their Superstitious Errors, and to settle them in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> This <hi>Canon</hi> would not down with my Lord of <hi>Glocester.</hi> And the Morning before the <hi>Subscription</hi> was to be, he came over to <hi>Lambeth</hi> to me; and after great expressions of his dislike, I gave him the best Counsel I could, that he would keep himself out of that scandal, which his refusing to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe would bring, both upon his Person, his Calling, and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in these broken times especially. But I fell so short of prevailing with him; that he told me plainly, <hi>He would be torn with wild Horses, before he would Subscribe that Canon:</hi> And so we parted.</p>
                     <p>The hour of <hi>Convocation</hi> drew on; and we met to <hi>Subscribe the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons.</hi> When it came to the Bishop of <hi>Glocester's</hi> turn, his Lordship would neither allow the <hi>Canons,</hi> nor reject them; but pretended, (as he had once done about a week before) that we had no Power to make <hi>Canons</hi> out of <hi>Parliament</hi> time, since the Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 8. It was then told his Lordship, that we had the <hi>King's</hi> Power according to that Statute; And that his Lordship was formerly satisfied by the <hi>Lawyers</hi> Hands, as well as we; And that this was but a pretence to disgrace our Proceedings, the better to hide his unwillingness to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe that <hi>Canon</hi> against the <hi>Papists;</hi> as appeared by that Speech, which he had privately used to me that Morning, and with which I publickly charged him upon this occasion; and he did as publickly in open <hi>Convocation</hi> acknowledge, that he spake the words unto me. Besides this, he was further told; that in all <hi>Synods</hi> the Suffragants were to declare themselves by open Affirmation or denyal of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> agreed upon; and that therefore he ought to express his <hi>Consent</hi> or his <hi>Dissent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And though at that time I pressed it no further on him, yet it stands with all Reason it should be so. For otherwise it may so fall out, that the <hi>Synod</hi> may be disappointed, and be able to determine nothing. And it seems, they were bound to declare in <hi>Synod.</hi> For otherwise, when points of difficulty or danger came, the Fathers might have with more sasety forborn to Vote; which yet they did not.

As also in the Act of the <hi>Submission of the Clergy,</hi> consisting of three Articles, when it came to Voting in that <note n="†" place="margin">Acta Synod: Lond: An: <hi>1532. M: S:</hi>
                        </note> House, <hi>the first Article was denied by eighteen, and referred by eight: The two other were denied by nineteen, and referred by seven; the residue consenting unto all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But neither of these, had they then been thought on, could have relieved the Bishop of <hi>Glocester:</hi> Because he neither <hi>doubted,</hi> nor <hi>referred;</hi> but peremptorily said to me that Morning, that he would be torn with wild Horses, before he would subscribe that <hi>Canon</hi> against the <hi>Papists:</hi> And yet when it came to the Subscription, he would neither <hi>affirm,</hi> nor <hi>deny</hi> the <hi>Canon;</hi> but would have turn'd it off, as if we had not Power to make those <hi>Canons.</hi> Therefore when his Lordship would not do either, I with the consent of the <hi>Synod</hi> suspended him. Divers of my Lords the Bishops were very tender of him, and the Scandal given by him. And <hi>John Davenant</hi> then Lord Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and <hi>Joseph Hall</hi> then Lord Bishop of <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> desired leave of the <hi>House,</hi> (and had it) to speak with my Lord
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54614:53"/>
of <hi>Glocester,</hi> to see if they could prevail with him. They did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail; and he came back and Subscribed the <hi>Canons,</hi> in open <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> But I told him: Considering his Lordship's Words, I did not know with what Mind he Subscribed; and would therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Duty acquaint his <hi>Majesty</hi> with all the Proceedings, and there leave it. The <hi>Subscription</hi> to the <hi>Canons</hi> went on, no one man else checking at any thing. And that work ended, the <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> was dissolved <hi>Maij</hi> 29. being <hi>Friday.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Convocation</hi> thus ended, I did acquaint his <hi>Majesty</hi> with my Lord of <hi>Glocester's</hi> Carriage, and with that which was done upon it. His <hi>Majesty</hi> having other Jealousies of this <hi>Bishop</hi> besides this, resolved to put him to it. So his Lordship was brought before the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Lords</hi> in <hi>Council;</hi> and restrained to his Lodging, and a <hi>Writ Ne exeat Regnum</hi> sent him. But this <hi>Writ</hi> proceeded not for any thing said or done by his Lordship in the <hi>Convocation,</hi> but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other information which his <hi>Majesty</hi> had received from some <hi>Agents</hi> of his beyond the Seas; As shall appear hereafter, if this be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected against me. In the mean time let this Bishop rest for me.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Canons,</hi> thus Freely and Unanimously Subscribed, were Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And at their first Publication they were generally approved in all Parts of the Kingdom; and I had Letters from the remotest Parts of it, full of Approbation: Insomuch, that not my self only, but my Breth'ren which lived near these Parts, and which were not yet gone down, were very much Joyed at it. But about a Month after their Printing, there began some Whisperings against them by some Ministers in <hi>London;</hi> and their Exceptions were spread in writing against them: And this set others on work both in the <hi>Western,</hi> and the <hi>Northern</hi> Parts: Till at last, by the practice of the <hi>Faction,</hi> there was suddenly a great alteration, and nothing so much cryed down as the <hi>Canons.</hi> The comfort is, <hi>Christ</hi> himself had his <hi>Osanna</hi> turned into a <hi>Crucifige</hi> in far less Time. By this means the Malice of the Time took another occasion to whet it self against me.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Synod</hi> thus ended, and the <hi>Canons</hi> having this Success; but especially the <hi>Parliament</hi> ending so unhappily; The King was very hardly put to it, and sought all other means, as well as he could, to get supply against the <hi>Scots.</hi> But all that he could get, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved too little, or came too late for that service. For the averse party in the late <hi>Parliament,</hi> or by and by after, before they part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ordered things so, and filled Mens Minds with such strange Jealousies; that the <hi>King's</hi> good People were almost generally possest, that his <hi>Majesty</hi> had a purpose to alter the ancient Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom, and to bring in Slavery upon his People: A thing (which for ought I know) his <hi>Majesty</hi> never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But the Parliament-men, which would not relieve the <hi>King,</hi> by their meeting in that <hi>Assembly,</hi> came to understand and inform one another; and at their return, were able to possess their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Countries with the Apprehensions themselves had; and so they did. Upon this, some Lords and others, who had by this time made an underhand solemn Confederacy with a strong faction of the <hi>Scots,</hi> brought an Army of them into the Kingdom. For all
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54614:54"/>
Men know, and it hath been in a manner confessed; that the <hi>Scots</hi> durst not have come into <hi>England</hi> at that Time, if they had not been sure of a Party here, and a strong one; and that the King should be betrayed on all hands, as shall after appear.</p>
                     <p>By these, and the like means, the <hi>King</hi> being not assisted by his <hi>Parliament,</hi> nor having Means enough to proceed with his Forces in due Time, the <hi>Scots</hi> were brought in (as is aforesaid) upon both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdom.</hi> They under the Conduct of Sir <hi>Alexander Lesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> their General, passed the <hi>Tyne</hi> at <hi>Newborne,</hi> 
                        <note n="†" place="margin">

And all this gross Treason, though it had no other end than to Confirm a <hi>Parliament</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and to make the <hi>King</hi> call another in <hi>England,</hi> that so they might in a way of Power extort from him what they pleased in both <hi>Kingdoms;</hi> yet <hi>Religion</hi> was made almost all the pretence both here, and there; and so in pursuance of that pretence, Hatred spread and increased against me, for the <hi>Service-Book.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>King</hi> hearing that the <hi>Scots</hi> were moving, Posted away to <hi>York, Aug.</hi> 20. being <hi>Thursday.</hi> There he soon found, in what Straights he was; and thereupon called his <hi>Great Council</hi> of all his Lords and Prelates to <hi>York</hi> to be there by <hi>September</hi> 24. But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Summons was short and suddain, he was Graciously plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to dispense with the Absence of divers, both Lords, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and with mine among the rest. How things in Particular succeeded there, I know not; nor belongs it much to the Scope of this short <hi>History,</hi> intended only for my self. But the Result of all, was a present Nomination of some <hi>Lords Commissioners,</hi> to treat at <hi>Rippon</hi> about this Great Affair with other <hi>Commissioners</hi> from the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army.</p>
                     <p>But before this Treaty at <hi>Rippon,</hi> one <hi>Melborne,</hi> or <hi>Meldrum,</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary to general <hi>Leshly</hi> (as he was commonly said to be) at the Shire-House in <hi>Durham,</hi> when the Country-Gentlemen met with the chief of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Army, about a composition to be made for Payment of Three Hundred and Fifty Pounds a Day for that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, expressed himself in this Manner, <hi>Septemb.</hi> 10. 1640. <hi>I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that you are so Ignorant, that you cannot see what is good for your selves. For they in the</hi> South <hi>are sensible of the good that will ensue, and that we came not unsent for, and that oftner than once, or twice, by your own Great Ones.</hi> There being a Doubt made at these words <hi>Great Ones:</hi> He reply'd, <hi>your own Lords;</hi> with farther Discourse. These Words were complained of, during the Treaty at <hi>Rippon,</hi> to the <hi>English</hi> Lords Commissioners, by two Gentlemen of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick</hi> of <hi>Durham;</hi> to whom the Words were spoken by <hi>Meldrum.</hi> The Gentlemen were Mr. <hi>John Killinghall,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nicholas Chay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;</hi> and they offer'd to Testify the Words upon Oath: But the Lords required them only to Write down those Words, and set their Hands to them; which they did very readily. The Lords acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Scotch Commissioners</hi> with the Words. They sent to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle</hi> to make them known to General <hi>Leshly.</hi> He called his Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary before him, questioned him about the Words. <hi>Meldrum</hi> deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them: (was that enough, against two such Witnesses?) This Denyal was put in Writing, and sent to <hi>Rippon.</hi> Hereupon some
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54614:54"/>
of the <hi>English Lords Commissioners</hi> required, that the two Gentlemen should go to <hi>Newcastle</hi> to the <hi>Scotch Camp,</hi> and there give in their Testimony before General <hi>Leshly.</hi> The two Gentlemen replyed (as they had great reason to do) that they had rather testify it in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Court of <hi>England,</hi> and could do it with more safety: Yet they would go and testify it there, so they might have a safe Conduct from the <hi>Scottish Commissioners,</hi> there being as yet no Cessation of Arms. Answer was made by some <hi>English Lords,</hi> that they should have a safe Conduct. Hereupon one of the <hi>Kings</hi> Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers attendant there, was sent to the <hi>Scotch Commissioners</hi> for a safe Conduct for the Two Gentlemen. He brought back Word from the Earl of <hi>Dumfermling</hi> (to whom it was directed) that the Two Gentlemen were unwise, if they went to give such Testimony at the Camp. And then speaking with the Lord <hi>Lowdon,</hi> he came again to the Messenger, and told him, that such a safe Conduct could not be granted, and that he would satisfy the <hi>Earl</hi> that sent for it (who was <hi>Francis</hi> Earl of <hi>Bedford.</hi>) The Messenger return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with this Answer, the Gentlemen were dismissed. So the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness dyed; it being not for somebody's safety, that this Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should have proceeded; for it is well enough known since, that many had their hands in this <hi>Treason,</hi> [for Gross <hi>Treason</hi> it was by the express Words of the Statute of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 2.] The Truth of all this will be sworn to by both the Gentlemen yet living, and by a very honest grave Divine, who was present at all these Passages at <hi>Rippon,</hi> and gave them to me in Writing.</p>
                     <p>In this <hi>Great Council,</hi> while the <hi>Treaty</hi> was proceeding slowly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; it was agreed on, that a <hi>Parliament</hi> should begin at <hi>London Nov.</hi> 3. following: And thither the <hi>Commissioners</hi> and the <hi>Treaty</hi> were to follow; and they did so. After this how things proceeded in Parliament, and how long the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army was continued, and at how great a charge to the Kingdom, appears olsewhere upon <hi>Record;</hi> for I shall hasten to my own particular, and take in no more of the Publick, than Necessity shall inforce me, to make my sad Story hang together.</p>
                     <p>After they had continued at <hi>York</hi> till <hi>Octob.</hi> 28. the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Lords</hi> returned, and the <hi>Parliament</hi> sate down <hi>Novemb.</hi> 3. Great Heats appear'd in the very beginning. On <hi>Wednesday</hi>

                        <p>THe Novations in Religion (which are universally acknowledged to be the main Cause of Commotions in Kingdoms and States, and are known to be the true Cause of our present Troubles) were many and great; besides the <note n="*" place="margin">Book, <hi>Rushw.</hi>

                     <p>I shall easily grant; <hi>that Novations in Religion are a main Cause of Distempers in Commonwealths.</hi> And I hope it will be as easily granted to me (I am sure it should) that when great Distempers fall into Kingdoms, and Common-wealths; the only way to ingage at home and get Credit abroad, is to pretend <hi>Religion;</hi> which in all Ages hath been a Cloak large enough to cover (at least from the Eyes of the Many) even Treasons themselves. And <hi>For the present Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in</hi> Scotland, <hi>Novations in Religion are so far from being known to be the true Cause,</hi> as that it is manifest to any Man, that will look upon it with a single Eye, that Temporal Discontents, and several Ambitions of the great Men, which had been long a working, were the true cause of these Troubles: And that <hi>Religion</hi> was call'd in upon the bye, to gain the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and by them the <hi>Multitude.</hi>

                        <hi>Lord Balmerino,</hi> who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of high Treason before any of these Stirs began. For there were <hi>Grievances</hi> (as they said) <hi>propounded in the Convention, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1628. about Coyning, and their black Money; <hi>which</hi> (they say) <hi>were slighted again in the Parliament held</hi> 1633. Murmuring also there was, as if the <hi>Articles and Parliament were not free.</hi> Great Clamour likewise was there against the <hi>Bishops Power in choosing the Lords of the Articles;</hi> though that Power belonged unto them by the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Laws of that Kingdom. As much against the <hi>Act of Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> and the <hi>Taxations</hi> (which yet were voluntarily offer'd, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called on purpose to edge the People:) As also for <hi>Applying</hi> (as they said) <hi>these Taxations to wrong uses:</hi> With all which, and more, Religion had nothing to do. Nay, this discontented Party grew so High and so Bold; that a very Base and Dishonourable <hi>Libel</hi> was made and spread against the <hi>King, Anno</hi> 1633. by these and the like Pretences to alienate the Hearts of the People from him.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54614:56"/>
not then on Foot. So that it is evident enough to any Man that will see, that these <hi>Commotions</hi> had another, and a higher cause, than the present pretended <hi>Innovations.</hi> And if his <hi>Majesty</hi> had played the <hi>King</hi> then, he needed not have suffered now. Besides, they are no Fools who have spoken it freely (since the <hi>Act of Oblivion</hi> for the <hi>Scottish</hi> Business was passed) that this great <hi>League</hi> before mentioned, between the discontented Party of both Kingdoms, was Consulted on in the Year 1632. and after the <hi>King's</hi> being in <hi>Scotland, Anno</hi> 1633. it went on, till they took occasion ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to hatch the Cockatrice Egg, which was laid so long before.</p>
                     <p>But they say, these <hi>Novations were great, besides the Books of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Homilies.</hi> So the Books of <hi>Ordination,</hi> and <hi>Homilies,</hi> were great <hi>Novations.</hi> Had they then in <hi>Scotland</hi> no set Form of <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?</hi> I promise you, that's next Neighbour to no <hi>Ordination;</hi> and no <hi>Ordination</hi> to no <hi>Church,</hi> formal at least. And therefore if this be a <hi>Novation</hi> among them, its high time they had it. And for the <hi>Homilies,</hi> if they taught no other Doctrine than was estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished and current in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> they were no <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations;</hi> and if they did contain other Doctrine, they might have Condemned them, and there had been an end. Howsoever, if <hi>these Books</hi> be among them in <hi>Scotland;</hi> they were sent thither in King <hi>James</hi> his Time, when the <hi>Prelate of</hi> Canterbury <hi>neither was, nor could be, the prime cause on Earth of that Novation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other <hi>Novations,</hi> which they proceed unto, are first, <hi>some particular Alterations in matters of Religion, pressed upon them without Order, and against Law.</hi> To this I can say nothing, till the <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Alterations</hi> be named. Only this in the general; be they what they will, the <hi>Scottish</hi> Bishops were to blame, if they pressed any thing <hi>without Order,</hi> or <hi>against Law.</hi> And sure I am, the <hi>Prelate of Canterbury</hi> caused them not, nor would have consented to the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of them, had he known them to be such. The two other <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,</hi> in which they instance, are the <hi>Book of Canons,</hi> and the <hi>Liturgy;</hi> which (they say) <hi>contain in them many dangerous Errours in Matter of Doctrine.</hi> To these, how dangerous soever they seem, I shall give (I hope) a very sufficient, and clear answer; and shall ingenuously set down whatsoever I did, either in or to the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Canons,</hi> and the <hi>Liturgy;</hi> and then leave the ingenuous Reader to judge, how far the <hi>Prelate of Canterbury is the prime cause on Earth of these Things.</hi>

Here begins the first Charge about the <hi>Particular Alterations.</hi> And first, they Charge me with <hi>Fourteen Letters</hi> written by me to Bishop <hi>Ballantyne.</hi> He was then Bishop of <hi>Dunblain,</hi> and Dean of His <hi>Majesties Chappel Royal</hi> there. He was a Learned and a Grave Man; and I did write divers Letters to him, as well as to some other Bishops, and some by Command; but whether just fourteen or no, I know not. But sure I am, their Love to me is such; that were any thing worse than other, in any of these Letters, I should be sure to hear of it.</p>
                     <p>First then, They say, <hi>I injoyned wearing of Whites,</hi> &amp;c. surely I understand my self a great deal better, than to injoyn where I have no Power. Perhaps I might express that, which <hi>His Majesty</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me, when I was <hi>Dean</hi> of his <hi>Majesty's Chappel</hi> here; as this <hi>Reverend Bishop</hi> was in <hi>Scotland:</hi> And <hi>His Majesty's</hi> Express Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was, that I should take that care upon me; that the <hi>Chappel</hi> there, and the <hi>Service,</hi> should be kept answerable to this, as much as might be; And that the <hi>Dean</hi> should come to Prayers in his <hi>Form,</hi> as likewise other <hi>Bishops</hi> when they came thither. And let my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters be shewed; whether there be any <hi>Injoyning,</hi> other than this; and this way. And I am confident, <hi>His Majesty</hi> would never have laid this Task upon me; had he known it to be, either without <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> or <hi>against Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Next I am Charged; that concerning <hi>these Whites,</hi> I brake <hi>my Promise to the Bishop of</hi> Edinburgh. Truly to the uttermost of my Memory, I cannot recall any such Passage, or <hi>Promise,</hi> made to that <hi>Reverend and Learned Prelate.</hi> And I must have bin very ill advised, had I made any such <hi>Promise;</hi> having no Warrant from his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi> to ingage for any such thing. As for that which follows; <hi>that he was moved against his will to put on those Garments:</hi> Truly he expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed nothing at that time to me, that might signifie it was against his Will. And his Learning and Judgment were too great, to stumble at such External Things: Especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such having been the Ancient <hi>Habits</hi> of the most <hi>Reverend Bishops</hi> from the descent of many Hundred Years; as may appear in the Life of St. <note n="*" place="margin">

                        <p>In these Letters, he (<hi>the Prelate of</hi> Canterbury) directs (Bishop <hi>Ballantine</hi>) to give Order for saying the <hi>English</hi> Service in the Chappel twice a day: For his neglect, shewing him that he was disappointed of the Bishoprick of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising him upon his greater care of these Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, advancement to a better Bishoprick.</p>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54614:57"/>
                        <hi>Novation</hi> at all in that place. For in the Year 1617. I had the Honour, as a Chaplain in Ordinary, to wait upon King <hi>James</hi> of Blessed Memory into <hi>Scotland;</hi> and then the <hi>English Service</hi> was Read in that <hi>Chappel,</hi> and twice a Day. And I had the Honour again to wait upon King <hi>Charles,</hi> as <hi>Dean of His Majesties Chappel Royal</hi> here, at his Coronation in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the Year 1633: And then also was the <hi>English Service</hi> Read twice a Day in that <hi>Chappel.</hi> And a strict Command was given them by <hi>His Majesty,</hi> that it should be so continued; and Allowance was made for it. And none of the <hi>Scots</hi> found any fault with it at that time, or after, till these Tumults began. And for <hi>Bishop</hi> Ballantyn's <hi>missing the Bishoprick of</hi> Edinburgh, <hi>and my promising him another upon his better Care of his Majesties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;</hi> I gave him both the Answers, and the Reason, and the Promise, which <hi>His Majesty</hi> gave me, and Commanded me to write to him.

                        <hi>Synod of Dort,</hi> called purposely about the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of <hi>Arminius,</hi> allows this for Orthodox; <hi>Christum Mortuum esse pro omnibus.</hi> And for my part, I wish with all my heart, that this had been the greatest Error of <hi>Arminius.</hi> But yet whether I taxed that worthy <hi>Prelate</hi> for this or no, I know not: This I know, that if I did tax him, he deserved it. And for Bishops, even of divers Churches, to write one to another about Points of Divinity, yea, and sometimes to tax one another too, as their Judgments lead them, hath been usual in all Times and Places. The next Charge is—
<q>
                           <p>That I bid him send up a List of the Names of the Counsellors, and Senators of the <hi>Colledge of Justice,</hi> who did not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in <hi>the Chappel,</hi> in a Form which was not received in our <hi>Kirk:</hi> And that I commended him, when I found him Obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious to these my Commandments; telling him, that I had moved <hi>the King</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, for the Punishment of such as had not received in <hi>the Chappel.</hi>

Here I must desire again, that <hi>this Letter</hi> of mine may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. For I have cause enough to suspect some material Change in the Matter or Form of my Words. Howsoever, if they be just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set down, I answer; That if this be one <hi>of the Things which made great Disturbance amongst them,</hi> they would be greatly disturbed with a very little. For first, I writ nothing in this, but what I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly Commanded by <hi>His Majesty:</hi> And I have <hi>His Majesties</hi> War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant under His Hand to keep a Correspondence with that Bishop of <hi>Dunblain;</hi> that from time to time he might receive <hi>His Majesties</hi> Direction by me, for the Ordering of all those Things. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, the thing it self is no more than as if <hi>His Majesty</hi> should Command all his <hi>Counsellors</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> here, once in the Year at least to receive the <hi>Communion</hi> in his <hi>Chappel at White-Hall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if you say 'tis more, because it was to <hi>Communicate in such a Form as was not received in the Church of</hi> Scotland; under Favour, that is not so neither. For this Form here spoken against, was to receive it <hi>Kneeling:</hi> And to receive the Sacrament <hi>Kneeling,</hi> was an <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>As for that which comes fluttering after, <hi>That I commended him, when I found him Obsequious;</hi> I had reason to do it: For (whatsoever is said here) it was to the <hi>Kings Commands,</hi> not to mine. And the Reason why I writ, <hi>that I had moved</hi> the King <hi>a Second time for the Punishment of such as disobeyed,</hi> was, because <hi>the Bishop</hi> had written unto me, that if some were not Checked, or Punished, none would obey. And 'tis true too; that I took occasion, once, and a second time, (but upon Second <hi>Letters</hi> of his to the same effect) to move <hi>the King:</hi> But only by shewing <hi>His Majesty,</hi> what was written by him, that was upon the place, and trusted with the Office. Nor did I ever meddle farther in those Businesses, than by laying before <hi>His Majesty</hi> what was written to me to that end: Leaving <hi>the King</hi> (as it became me) to Judge both of the Motion, and the Person that made it, as in his Princely Wisdom he thought fit. The next thing is, that in these <hi>Letters,</hi>

                        <hi>their Church presumptuously, as opposite herein to Christianity.</hi> Surely I do not use to <hi>upbraid</hi> meaner Men than the <hi>Bishop</hi> is; much less presumptuously <hi>to censure a Church.</hi> If I thought (as I do) that <hi>

                     <p>As for the Custom in <hi>Scotland,</hi> of Fasting on the <hi>Lord's-Day;</hi> It is not only <hi>sometimes,</hi> as is here expressed; but <hi>continually,</hi> when they have any Solemn Fast, the <hi>Lord's-Day</hi> is the Day for it.

For it is against the Practice of the whole Church of <hi>Christ:</hi> And that which is so, must <hi>oppose Christianity it self.</hi> And this I find: That as Apostolical Universal Tradition settled the <hi>Lord's-Day</hi> for Holy and Publick Worship; So from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Apostles times, the same general Tradition hath in all times accounted it unlawful to Fast upon that Day.

                     <p>It is manifest here by their own Words, that these <hi>Memorials,</hi> and <hi>Instructions,</hi> whatsoever they were, had not <hi>me the Prelate of</hi> Canterbury <hi>for their prime cause on Earth;</hi> for they came from the Reverend and Prudent <hi>Arch-Bishop of St. Andrews,</hi> to the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend <note place="margin">To be deliver'd.</note> 
                        <hi>Bishop of Ross,</hi> by him to <hi>deliver</hi> to me, for <hi>the ordering of the Affairs of the Kirk and Kingdom of Scotland.</hi> Surely, I think no Man will judge it to be a Crime in me, to give my Brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren the Bishops of <hi>Scotland</hi> the Best Counsel, and with that Counsel the best Assistance to his <hi>Majesty,</hi> that I could in their Church-Affairs; considering their absence, and remoteness from him, and the Place that I bear about him. And for my own part, had I been defective therein; I should have thought my self not only unkind to them, but faulty otherwise in my Duty, both to his <hi>Majesty,</hi> and that <hi>Church.</hi> But for the <hi>Affairs of that Kingdom</hi> (though I had the Honour to be a <hi>Sworn Counsellor of that State</hi> as well as <hi>this</hi>) yet I never medled with them, but at such time, and in such a way, as I was called and commanded to, by his <hi>Majesty.</hi> Let us therefore see the Particulars, which are Named.</p>

                        <pb n="94" facs="tcp:54614:59"/>
                        <p>As not only to obtain Warrants to order the Exchequer, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy-Council, the great Commission of Surrenders, The matter of <hi>Balmerinoe's</hi> Process, as might please our Prelates; but Warrants also for the sitting of the High-Commission-Court once a Week in <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> and to gain from the Noble-Men, for the Benefit of the Prelates and their Adhaerents, the <hi>Abbacies</hi> of <hi>Kelsoe, Arbroth, St. Andrews</hi> and <hi>Lindores.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </q>
                     <p>For the first of these, <hi>my obtaining Warrants to order the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer there;</hi> that is indeed an Affair of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and a great one. But all or most that I did herein, was at the earnest entreaty of the Earl of <hi>Traquair,</hi> Treasurer Depute, and after that <hi>Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer;</hi> who avowed to me, that if the Orders were setled for the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> he would not only bring the <hi>King</hi> out of Debt, but raise him some Revenue also; with a Protestation farther, that for that, and some such like particulars, he could trust no hand but mine in his absence to get them done, and kept private. And at so great an Officers intreaty, and for Matters under his own Charge, I could not refuse so much Service for the <hi>King,</hi> as was pretended by him.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Orders to the Privy-Council,</hi> I remember not any procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by me. And sure I am, if I did any thing to that Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Body, it was by his <hi>Majesty's</hi> Command, and in relation to Church Affairs there. And for the <hi>Great Commission of Surrenders,</hi> in which both the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and the inferiour <hi>Clergy,</hi> were deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed, and did much fear the loss of their Tythes, and to be made Stipendiaries; I conceive, I had all the reason in the World to give them my best assistance; and yet I undertook not this Care, till his <hi>Majesty</hi> gave me a special Command to do what I did. And if the <hi>Bishops</hi> were in any thing mistaken in this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission;</hi> that cannot <note n="*" place="margin">Be charged.</note> charge upon me, who followed it no farther than I received special directions from his <hi>Majesty</hi> for the publick good. For the Lord <hi>Balmerinoe's Process,</hi> I heard much discourse of it at Court, but I medled nothing with it, one way or other, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that at the intreaty of some Men of Honour of that Nation, I did twice (if not thrice) adventure to become an humble Suitor to his <hi>Majesty</hi> in that Lord's behalf. And this was all the Harm I did him.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>High-Commission-Court,</hi> if there were no fault in it, as such a <hi>Court,</hi> then I am sure, there could be none in the Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it once a Week. If the having of such a <hi>Court</hi> be a Fault (as it seems 'tis now accounted, as well here, as there) yet for my own part, with all humble Submission to better Judgment, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think it is; and I must still pray, that both Nations have not Cause to Repent the Abolishing of it. But howsoever, this was not of my procuring. A <hi>Scotchman</hi> of good Place was imployed about it from the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and effected it; and I could name him; but since it is here charged as a Fault, I shall accuse no Man else, but defend my self. And this for the Sitting of it once a Week. But for the establishing of that <hi>Court</hi> in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; that was done long before I was a <hi>Bishop,</hi> or had any thing to

                        </note> Factionists in that Kingdom; that the <hi>Hich-Commission-Court</hi> was setled, and in full Execution in the Year 1610. when all Men know I led a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Life in <hi>Oxford;</hi> by which it is more than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that I neither was, nor could be, Author of this pretended <hi>Novation,</hi> or any disturbance that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed from it.</p>
                     <p>The next is a great Charge indeed, were there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Truth in it: That I <hi>laboured to gain from the Noblemen, for the Benefit of the Prelates, and their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haerents, the Abbacies of</hi> Kelsoe, Arbroth, S. Andrews, <hi>and</hi> Lindores. To begin at the last; The Man that followed that, was Mr. <hi>Andrew Lermot.</hi> He came recommended to me very highly, and with assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that the Title which he laid to <hi>Lindores</hi> was Just and Legal. But notwithstanding all this, my Answer was, That I knew not the Laws of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, nor would meddle with any thing of that nature. And though he made great means to me, yet he could never get me to meddle in it; and which is more, I told him and his Friends; that for so much as I did understand, I did much fear this way, taken by him, would do Mischief. And tho' Mr. <hi>Lermot</hi> have the general repute of an Honest and a Learned Man; yet for this very business sake, I have made my self a Stranger to him, ever since; and that all this is Truth, he and his Friends yet living are able to Testify.</p>
                     <p>For St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> his <hi>Majesty</hi> took a resolution to Rebuild the <hi>Cathedral</hi> there; which he found he could no way so well do, as by annexing that <hi>Abby</hi> to the <hi>Arch-Bishoprick</hi> of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> with a Legal Caution for so much Yearly to be laid out upon that Building. My Lord Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> and <hi>Lenox,</hi> who was ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it; had for it ....... Thousand Pounds. The Earl of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quair</hi> (who then managed the <hi>Lord Duke's</hi> Affairs) made the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with the <hi>King;</hi> and that which I did in it, was meerly to consider, how security might be given, that the Money, which the <hi>King</hi> intended for so good and great a Work, as the rebuilding of that <hi>Cathedral,</hi> might be imployed to the right use, and no other.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Arbroth,</hi> my Lord Marquis <hi>Hamilton,</hi> without any the least Thought of mine that way, made his earnest Suit to me; that his <hi>Majesty</hi> would take <hi>Arbroth,</hi> and joyn it to the very poor Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick of <hi>Brechen,</hi> close to which it lay, and give him for it <note n="*" place="margin">

But things were so carried by the Earl of <hi>Traquair</hi> the Lord Treasurer of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that the poor Bishop of <hi>Brechen</hi> could never get that setled upon his <hi>See:</hi> which was not the only thing, in which that Lord played fast and loose with me.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Kelsoe,</hi> the like earnest Suit did my Lord the Earl of <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> make to me of himself for an Exchange, and pressed me
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54614:60"/>
three or four times, before he could get me to move <hi>his Majesty.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I was fearful, least the <hi>King</hi> should grow weary of such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes; (for sure I was, whatsoever was pretended, none of these Lords meant to lose by their Bargain:) Till at last, my Lord of <hi>Roxborough</hi> was so Honourable, as that he would needs leave <hi>Kelsoe</hi> to the King's disposing, and stay for such Recompence, as he should think fit to give him, till <hi>his Majesty</hi> found his own time. This (at his earnest intreaty still) I acquainted <hi>the King</hi> with: And so that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness setled for a small time; but how 'tis now, I know not. And this was all, that ever I did about <hi>Arbroth</hi> and <hi>Kelsoe.</hi> And these two Honourable Lords are yet living, and will witness this Truth. But the Charge says farther—
<q>
                           <p>That in the smallest Matters, they <hi>(the Prelates)</hi> received his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments: As for taking down Galleries, and stone Walls, in the Kirks of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> for no other end, but to make way for Altars, and Adoration towards the <hi>East:</hi> which (beside other Evils) made no small noise and disturbance amongst the People, deprived hereby of their ordinary accommodation for Publick Worship.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Charge is like the rest. Is it probable, that such Grave and Learned Men, as those of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Bishops were, which held in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse with me, should not resolve <hi>in the smallest Matters, till they received my Commandments;</hi> who never sent Command to any of them in my Life, but what I received expresly from <hi>the King?</hi> And they certainly were not for <hi>the smallest Matters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the taking down of Galleries in St. <hi>Andrews;</hi> to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of my Memory, I never gave either Command or Direction. Nor can it stand with any shew of probability, that I should <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the taking down of Galleries in St.</hi> Andrews, where I had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do, and let <hi>Galleries</hi> stand in so many Churches in <hi>London,</hi> and other parts of my <hi>Province,</hi> where I had Power. The Truth is; I did never like <hi>Galleries</hi> in any <hi>Church.</hi> They utterly deface the grave Beauty and Decency of those <hi>Sacred Places;</hi> and make them look more like a <hi>Theater,</hi> than a <hi>Church.</hi> Nor in my Judgment, do they make any <hi>great accomodation</hi> for the Auditory: For in most places, they hinder as much room beneath, as they make above; rendring all, or most of, those places useless, by the noise and trampling of them, which stand above in the <hi>Galleries.</hi> And if I be mistaken in this, 'tis nothing to the business in hand: For be <hi>Galleries</hi> what they will for the use, I commanded not the taking of them down at St. <hi>Andrews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the <hi>King's</hi> Command took down the stone Walls and Galleries, which were there removed, and not mine. For <hi>his Majesty</hi> having in a Christian and Princely way, Erected and Indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>Bishoprick</hi> in <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> he resolved to make the great Church of St. <hi>Giles</hi> in that City, a <hi>Cathedral:</hi> And to this end, gave Order to have the <hi>Galleries</hi> in the lesser Church, and the <hi>Stone-wall</hi> which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided them, taken down. For of old, they were both one Church, and made two by a Wall, built up at the <hi>West</hi> end of the Chancel; So
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54614:60"/>
that that which was called the <hi>lesser Church,</hi> was but the <hi>Chancel</hi> of St. <hi>Giles,</hi> with Galleries round about it; And was for all the World like a square Theater, without any shew of a Church: As is also the Church at <hi>Brunt-Iland</hi> over-against it. And I remember, when I pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed over at the <hi>Frith,</hi> I took it, at first sight, for a large square <hi>Pigeon-House:</hi> So free was it from all suspition of being so much as built like an Antient Church. Now, since <hi>his Majesty</hi> took down these <hi>Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and the <hi>Stone-wall,</hi> to make St. <hi>Giles's</hi> Church a <hi>Cathedral</hi> there; certainly my Command took them not down, to <hi>make way for Altars, and Adoration towards the East;</hi> which I never commanded in that, or any other Church in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The Charge goes on.</p>

                     <p>This Charge begins with a General, and will come to Particulars after. And first, it seems they are angry with a <hi>Book of Canons.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Church-Government, it seems, they would have, that will admit of no <hi>Canons,</hi> to direct or controul their Liberty. And if they mean <hi>by obtruding upon their Church,</hi> that the <hi>Canons</hi> were unduly thrust upon them, because that <hi>Book</hi> was Confirmed by the <hi>King's</hi> Anthority; then 'tis a bold Phrase to call it <hi>Obtruding.</hi> For if <hi>His Majesty</hi> that now is, did by his Sole Authority Command the present <hi>Book of Canons</hi> to the Church of <hi>Scotland;</hi> he did but Exercise that Power which King <hi>James</hi> challenged did in the right of his Crown belong to him: As appears manifestly by a Letter of his to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of <hi>Scotland</hi> then Assembled at <hi>Perth.</hi> That Royal Letter is large, but very worthy any Mans Reading, and is to be seen in the <note n="*" place="margin">Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at Perth. p. <hi>50.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those Proceedings.</hi> But because they speak of my <hi>Novations,</hi> if they mean that this Book of <hi>Canons</hi> was Obtruded upon their Church by me; Or if it were found in a Just Synod, and upon fair Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to <hi>Establish a Tyrannical Power of the Prelates over the Worship of God, or the Consciences, Liberties, or Goods of the People; Or for Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing any thing that was setled by Laws;</hi> they had Reason both to be troubled, and to seek in a Dutiful manner, first rightly to inform <hi>His Majesty,</hi> and then to desire a Remedy from him. But if the <hi>Book of Canons</hi> did really none of these things, as (for ought I yet know) it did not, and as I hope will appear, when they come to Particulars; then this will be no longer a <hi>Charge,</hi> but a <hi>Slander.</hi> And howsoever, if any thing in those <hi>Canons</hi> were Ordered <hi>against their Laws;</hi> it was by our invincible Ignorance, and their Bishops fault,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54614:61"/>
that would not tell us, wherein we went <hi>against their Laws,</hi> if so we did. And for my own part; I did ever advise them to make sure in the whole Business, that they attempted nothing <hi>against Law.</hi> But if their late <hi>General Assembly,</hi> in which (they say) these things were found to be <hi>against Law,</hi> did proceed <hi>Unwarrantably,</hi> or <hi>Factiously,</hi> (as the most Learned Men of that Kingdom avow it did;) the less heed must, and will in future times, be given to their Proceedings. But before they come to Particulars, they think fit to lay Load on me, and say—
<q>
                           <p>That <hi>Canterbury</hi> was Master of this Work, is manifest, by a Book of <hi>Canons</hi> sent to him, written upon the one side only, with the other side blank, for Corrections, Additions, and putting all in better Order, at his pleasure: Which accordingly was done; as may appear by the Interlinings, Marginals, and filling up of the Blank Pages, with Directions sent to our Prelates.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I was no <hi>Master of this Work,</hi> but a Servant to it, and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereunto by His Sacred <hi>Majesty</hi> (as I have to shew under his Hand.) And the Work it self was begun in His Majesties Blessed Fathers Time: For the Bishops of <hi>Scotland</hi> were gathering their Canons then. And this is most manifest by a Passage in the <hi>Sermon,</hi> which my Lord the Arch-Bishop of <hi>S. Andrews</hi> Preached before the <hi>General Assembly</hi> at <hi>Perth, An.</hi> 1618, when I was a private Man, and had nothing to do with these things. The words are these: <hi>And when I least expected, these Articles</hi> (that is, the five Articles of <hi>Perth</hi>) <hi>were sent unto me; not to be proponed to the Church, but to be</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Proceedings of Perth. p. <hi>40.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>inserted amongst the Canons thereof, which were then in gathering, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which Point I humbly excused my self,</hi> &amp;c. So this Work was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and known to that Church, long before I had any thing to do with it. And now, when it came to be Perfected, I did nothing but as I was Commanded, and Warranted, by His <hi>Majesty.</hi> But indeed according to this Command, I took a great deal more pains than I have thanks for; as it too often falls out with the best Church-Men. To this end, 'tis true, a <hi>Book of Canons</hi> was not sent me, but brought by my Lord the Bishop of <hi>Ross,</hi> and delivered to me: And <hi>if it were written on one side only, and left Blank on the other for Corrections, or Additions;</hi> I hope there's no sin in that, to leave room and space for me to do that, for which <hi>the Book</hi> was brought to me. As for that which follows, it hath less fault in it. For they say, it was for <hi>my putting all in better Order.</hi> And I hope, to put all in better Order, is no Crime Censurable in this Court. And whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they of <hi>Scotland</hi> think; that Church did then need <hi>many things to be put in better Order,</hi> and at this Day need <hi>many more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yea, but they say, this should not be done <hi>at my pleasure.</hi> I say so too; Neither was it. For whatsoever I thought fit to correct, or add in the Copy brought to me, I did very humbly and fairly submit to the <hi>Church of Scotland:</hi> And under those Terms delivered it back to the <hi>Bishop</hi> which <hi>brought it, with all the Interlinings, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals, and fillings up of Blank Pages, and the best Directions I was able to give them.</hi> And all this was in me, Obedience to <hi>His Majesty,</hi> and no Wrong, that I know, to the <hi>Church of Scotland;</hi> I am sure not
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54614:61"/>
intended by me. Neither are these <hi>Interlinings, or Additions,</hi> so many, as they are here insinuated to be; for the Bishops of <hi>Scotland</hi> had been very careful in this Work. All which would clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, were <hi>the Book</hi> produced. Yet the Charge goes on against me still.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>And that it was done by no other than <hi>Canterbury,</hi> is evident by his Magisterial way of Prescribing; and by a new Copy of these <hi>Canons,</hi> all written with <hi>S. Andrews</hi> own hand precisely to a Letter, according to the former Castigations and Directions, sent back to procure <hi>the King's</hi> Warrant unto it; which accordingly was obtained.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>By no other Hand than</hi> Canterburies, is very roundly affirmed. How is it proved? Why, by two Reasons. First they say, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, <hi>by his Magisterial way of Prescribing.</hi> An Excellent Argument! The <hi>Book of Canons</hi> was delivered to me ready made. That which was mine, is here confessed to be but <hi>Interlinings,</hi> and <hi>Marginals,</hi> and <hi>Corrections;</hi> and at most some <hi>Additions:</hi> And they would be found a very small <hi>Some,</hi> were the Original Book seen. And yet it must be Evident, that no Hand but mine did this, <hi>by my Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial way of Prescribing,</hi> in an <hi>Interlining, or a Marginal.</hi> Excellent Evidence! Secondly, they have another great Evidence of this. But because that is so nervous and strong; I will be bold to reduce it to some Form, that it may appear the clearer, though it be against my self. <hi>There was</hi> (they say) <hi>a new Copy of these</hi> Canons <hi>all written with</hi> S. Andrews <hi>own Hand, and according to the former Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigations and Directions, sent to have</hi> the King's <hi>Warrant to it, which was obtained:</hi> Therefore these <hi>Interlinings</hi> and <hi>Marginals,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>were done by no other than</hi> Canterbury. Most Excellent Evidence, and clear as Mid-Night!</p>
                     <p>The plain <hi>Truth</hi> is contrary to all this <hi>Evidence.</hi> For by the same Command of <hi>His Majesty,</hi> the Reverend Bishop of <hi>London</hi> was joyned with me in all the view, and Consideration, which I had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the <hi>Book of Canons,</hi> or upon the <hi>Service-Book</hi> after. So it is utterly untrue; that these <hi>Interlinings,</hi> or <hi>Marginals,</hi> or <hi>Corrections,</hi> or call them what you will, <hi>were done by no other than</hi> Canterbury. For my <hi>Lord of London's</hi> both Head and Hand were as deep in them as mine. And this I avow for well known Truth, both to the <hi>King,</hi> and those <hi>Scottish Bishops</hi> which were then imployed; and this notwithstanding all the Evidences of <hi>a Magisterial way,</hi> and <hi>a New Copy.</hi> And yet this General Charge pursues me yet farther, and says,
<q>
                           <p>The Kings Warrant was obtained (as is said) to these <hi>Canons,</hi> but with an Addition of some other <hi>Canons,</hi> and a Page of <note n="†" place="margin">Some other, <hi>Rushw.</hi> &amp; <hi>Pryn.</hi>
                              </note> New Corrections, according to which the <hi>Book of Canons</hi> thus Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, was Published in Print. The inspection of the Books, Instructions, and his Letters of Joy for the success of the Work, and of other Letters <note n="*" place="margin">of <hi>Rushw,</hi> &amp; <hi>Pryn.</hi>
                              </note> from the Prelate of <hi>London,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Sterling,</hi> to the same purpose, (all which we are ready to exhibit,) will put the Matter out of all debate.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="100" facs="tcp:54614:62"/>
Yet more ado about nothing? Yet more noise of Proof <hi>to put that out of all debate,</hi> which need never enter into any? For if no more be intended, than that I had a view of the <hi>Book of Canons, and did make some Interlinings, and Marginals, and the like;</hi> I have freely acknowledged it, and by whose Command I did it, and who was joyned with me in the Work. So there will need no Proof of this, either by my <hi>Letters,</hi> or the <hi>Prelate of Londons,</hi> or the <hi>Lord Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</hi> Yet let them be exhibited, if you please. But if it be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (as 'tis laid) <hi>that this was done by no other than</hi> Canterbury; then I utterly deny it; and no Proof here named, or any other shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to make it good.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>the Addition of some other</hi> Canons, <hi>and Pages of New Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, according to which the</hi> Book of Canons <hi>is said to be Composed and Published:</hi> Truly, to the utmost of my Memory, I know of none such; but that the Copy written by my <hi>Lord of S. Andrews</hi> own Hand, and sent up, (as is before mentioned) was the very Copy which was Warranted by <hi>His Majesty,</hi> and Published without any further <hi>Alteration.</hi> But if any further <hi>Alteration</hi> were; it was by the same <hi>Authority,</hi> and with the same <hi>Consent. And for my Letters of Joy for the Success of the Work;</hi> let them be exhibited, when you please. I will never deny that Joy, while I live, that I conceived of the Church of <hi>Scotland's</hi> coming nearer, both in the <hi>Canons,</hi> and the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But our gross unthankfulness both to our <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> and our other many and great Sins, have hindred this great Blessing. And I pray God, that the loss of this. which was now almost effected, do not in short time prove one of the greatest Mischiefs which ever befel this Kingdom, and that too. This is the General Charge about the <hi>Canons;</hi> Now follow the Particulars.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Beside this General Charge; there be some things more special, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be adverted unto, for discovering his Spirit. First, the Fourth</hi> Canon <hi>of Cap</hi> 8. For as much as no Reformation in Doctrine or Discipline can be made perfect at once in any Church: Therefore it shall and may be Lawful for the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> at any time, to make Remonstrances to <hi>His Majesty,</hi> or his Successours, &amp;c. <hi>Because this Canon holds the Door open to more Innovations; he writes to the Prelate of</hi> Ross, <hi>his Prime Agent in all this Work, of his great Gladness, that this Canon did stand behind the Curtain; And his great desire, that this Canon might be Printed fully, as one that was to be most useful.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Now come the Particulars, <hi>worthy to be adverted unto for the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of my Spirit.</hi> And the first is taken out of the <hi>Fourth Canon of Cap.</hi> 8. The Charge is, that <hi>this Canon holds the Door open to more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations.</hi> First I conceive, this Accusation is vain. For <hi>that Canon restrains all Power from private Men, Clergy or Laye; nay, from Bishops in a Synod, or otherwise, to alter any thing in Doctrine or Discipline, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Authority from</hi> His Majesty <hi>or his Successours.</hi> Now all Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions come from private assumption of Authority, not from Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity it self. For in Civil Affairs, when <hi>the King</hi> and <hi>the State,</hi> upon Emergent Occasions, shall abrogate some Old Laws, and make other
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54614:62"/>
New, that cannot be counted an <hi>Innovation.</hi> And in Church-Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, every <hi>Synod,</hi> that hath sate in all times, and all places of Christendom, have with leave of Superiour Authority, declared some Points of Doctrine, condemned other-some; Altered some Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonials, made new Constitutions for better assisting the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And none of these have ever been accounted Innovations, the Foundations of Religion still remaining firm and unmoved. Nay, under favour, I conceive it most necessary, that thus it ought to be. And therefore, <hi>this Canon is far from holding a Door open for more Innovations;</hi> since it shuts it upon all, and leaves no Power to alter any thing, <hi>but by making a Remonstrance to the Supream Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> that in a Church-way approbation may be given when there is Cause.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, if I did write to the <hi>Prelate of</hi> Ross, <hi>that this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non might be Printed fully, as one that was to be most useful:</hi> I writ no more then, than I believe now. For certainly it is a <hi>Canon,</hi> that in a well-governed Church may be of great use: And the more, because in Truth, it is but Declaratory of that Power, which a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church</hi> hath, with leave and approbation of the Supream Power, to alter, and change, any alterable thing pertaining to Doctrine or Discipline in the Church. And as for that Phrase, said to be in my Letter, that <hi>this Canon did stand behind the Curtain:</hi> it was thus occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned. My Lord, the Bishop of <hi>Ross,</hi> writ unto me, from the Arch-Bishop of <hi>S. Andrews,</hi> that no words might be made of this <hi>Canon;</hi> (what their Reason was, they best know:) I returned Answer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in this sort; <hi>That the Canon stood behind the Curtain,</hi> and would not be throughly understood by every Man; yet advised the Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in regard of the <hi>necessary use of it.</hi> For let this <hi>Canon</hi> be in force, and right use made of it; and a <hi>National Church</hi> may ride safe by God's Ordinary Blessing, through any Storm; which without this Latitude it can never do. The next Charge is in—
<q>
                           <p n="2">2. <hi>The Title prefixed to these</hi> Canons <hi>by our Prelates. For there 'tis thus:</hi> Canons agreed on to be proponed to the several Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland; And is thus changed by</hi> Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury; Canons and Constitutions Ecclesiastical, &amp;c. Ordained to be observed by the Clergy. <hi>He will not have Canons to come from the Authority of Synods, but from the Power of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, or from the Kings Prerogative.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I perceive, they mean to sift narrowly, when the <hi>Title</hi> cannot scape. But truly in this Charge, I am to seek, which is greater in my Accusers, their Ignorance, or their Malice: Their Ignorance in the Charge; or their Malice in the Inference upon it. The <hi>Title</hi> was, <hi>Canons agreed upon to be proponed to the Synods of the Kirk of Scotland.</hi> And this was very fit, to express the <hi>Prelates</hi> intendment, which (for ought I know) was to propose them so. But <hi>this Book,</hi> which was brought to me, was to be Printed: And then that <hi>Title</hi> could not stand with any Congruity of Sense. For no Church uses to Print <hi>Canons, which are to be proponed to their Synods;</hi> but such as have been proposed, and agreed on. Nor did this altering of the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54614:63"/>
                        <hi>Title,</hi> in any the least thing hinder those worthy <hi>Prelates</hi> from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating them with their <hi>Synods,</hi> before they Printed them. And therefore the Inference must needs be extream full of <hi>Malice,</hi> to force from hence, that <hi>I would not have Canons come from the Authority of Synods, but from the Power of Prelates, or the King's Prerogative:</hi> Whereas most manifest it is, that the fitting of this <hi>Title</hi> for the Press, doth neither give any Power to <hi>Prelates,</hi> nor add to the <hi>King's Prerogative</hi> more than is his due, nor doth it detract any thing from the <hi>Authority of Synods.</hi> For I hope, the <hi>Bishops</hi> had no purpose but to Ordain them in <hi>Synod</hi> to be observed by the Clergy, &amp;c. and Approved and Published by the <hi>King's</hi> Consent and Authority. After this, comes—
<q>
                           <p n="3">
                              <hi>3.</hi> The formidable Canon, <hi>Cap. 1. 3.</hi> threatning no less than Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, against all such Persons whatsoever shall open their Mouths against any of these Books; proceeded not from our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, nor is to be found in <note n="*" place="margin">The Copies, <hi>Rushw.</hi> the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, <hi>Pryn.</hi>
                              </note> Copies sent from them, but is a Thunderbolt forged in <hi>Canterbury's</hi> own Fire.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, whether <hi>this Canon be to be found in the Copies sent from your Prelates, or not,</hi> I cannot tell; but sure it was in the Copy brought to me, or else my Memory forsakes me very strangely. Secondly, after all this Noise made of a <hi>Formidable Canon,</hi> because no less is threatned than <hi>Excommunication;</hi> I would fain know, what the Church can do less upon Contempt of her <hi>Canons, Liturgy,</hi> and <hi>Ordinations,</hi> than to <hi>Excommunicate</hi> the Offenders; or what Church, in any Age, laid less upon a Crime so great. Thirdly, suppose this <hi>Thunderbolt</hi> (as 'tis called) <hi>were forged in</hi> Canterbury's <hi>Fire;</hi> yet that Fire was not outragious. For this <hi>Canon</hi> contains as much as the 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. <hi>Canons</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> made in the beginning of the gracious Reign of King <hi>James:</hi> And yet to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of those <hi>Canons</hi> there is an Excommunication <hi>in Facto</hi> affix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for every one of these Crimes single: Whereas this <hi>Canon</hi> shoots this one <hi>Thunderbolt</hi> but once against them all. And this I would my Accusers should know; that if no more <hi>Thunderbolts had been forged in their Fire,</hi> than have been in mine; nor <hi>State,</hi> nor <hi>Church</hi> would have Flamed, as of late they have done.</p>

                     </q>
                     <p>Here's a great general Accusation, offered to be made good by three Particulars. The general is, <hi>that in the Copy of the Canons, which their Prelates sent, there's a dislike of</hi> Papists: <hi>But none in the Edition, as it was alter'd by me.</hi> Now this is utterly untrue; for it is manifest <hi>cap.</hi> 1. 1. There is express care taken for <hi>the King's</hi>
                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:54614:63"/>
Majesty's Jurisdiction over the Estate Ecclesiastical, and abolishing all Foreign Power repugnant to it. <hi>And again in the same Canon,</hi> That no Foreign Power hath <hi>(in his Majesty's Dominions)</hi> any Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment by the Law of God: <hi>And this with an Addition,</hi> That the Exclusion of all such Power is just. <hi>And,</hi> Cap. <hi>2. 9. 'tis Ordained,</hi> that every Ecclesiastical Person shall take the Oath of Supremacy. <hi>And,</hi> Cap. <hi>10. 3.</hi> All Readers in any Colledge or Schools, shall take the Oaths of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance and Supremacy. <hi>And sure, I think, 'tis no great matter, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Papists, <hi>or</hi> Popery <hi>be Named; so long as the</hi> Canons <hi>go so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly against them. This for the General. Now for the three Particulars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And first, That which was in Cap. 8. 15.</hi> That a Minister shall be deposed, if he be found negligent to convert Papists; <hi>I did think fit to leave out, upon these two Grounds. The one, that the Word</hi> Negligent <hi>is too general an Expression, and of too large an extent, to lay a Minister open to</hi> Deposition. <hi>And if Church-Governours, to whom the execution of the</hi> Canons <hi>is committed, should forget Christian Moderation (as they may</hi> Pati humana) <hi>a very worthy Minister might sometimes be undone for a very little</hi> Negligence; <hi>for Negligence is Negligence, be it never so little. Besides, I have learned out of the</hi> Canons <hi>of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Can. <hi>69.</hi>
                        </note> gross Negligence, <hi>in a matter as great as this is, is punished but with</hi> Suspension for three Months. <hi>The other Ground, why I omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this clause, is; Because I do not think the Church of</hi> Scotland, <hi>or any other particular Church, is so blessed in her Priests, as that every of her Ministers is for Learning, and Judgment, and Temper, Able and Fit to convert Papists. And therefore I did think then, and do think yet; that it is not so easie a work, or to be made so common; but that it is, and may be much fitter for some able selected Men to undertake. And if any Man think God's Gifts in him to be neglected (as Men are apt to overva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue themselves;) let them try their Gifts, and labour their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version in God's Name: But let not the Church by a</hi> Canon <hi>set every Man on work; lest their Weak or Indiscreet Performance hurt the Cause, and blemish the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second Particular is an excellent one. 'Tis about the <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Bread</hi> in the Blessed Sacrament, <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. 6. And 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, as if this Superstition were condemned in the Copies sent by their Prelates, but left out by me. Good God! how shameless are <hi>these Church-Men!</hi> for they drew up <hi>these Articles</hi> against me, though the Lay-Commissioners delivered them. And was there neither Clergy nor Lay-Man among them so careful, as to compare the words of <hi>the Charge,</hi> with the words of the <hi>Canon,</hi> before they would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to deliver them into so great a Court as <hi>the Parliament of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> Would not <hi>Mr. Alexander Henderson,</hi> who was the Prime Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in these Church-Affairs, be so careful for himself, and his own Reputation, as not publickly to deliver in a most Notorious Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth? For most manifest it is, that these words, <hi>As therefore the Adoration of the Bread is condemned,</hi> &amp;c. stand still in the Copy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised by me, as is to be seen in the Printed Copy of <hi>those Canons;</hi> and in the same place by them quoted; and in a different <hi>Character;</hi>
                        <pb n="104" facs="tcp:54614:64"/>
that I wonder how any Man's Eye could miss them. So here I am accused for putting that out, which I left in.</p>
                     <p>The third Particular is, <hi>That their Prelates call the Absoluteness of Baptism an Error of Popery, Cap.</hi> 6. 2. Which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>When I met so often with this Phrase; <hi>Our Prelates</hi> do not this, and that, <hi>in which</hi> Canterbury <hi>is Punctual and Peremptory:</hi> It made me hope at first, these Men had some good Opinion of their <hi>own Prelates.</hi> But so soon as they had once gotten the Power into their own Hands; they made it presently appear, that though <hi>their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates had not the boldness to trouble them;</hi> yet they had the Impudence to cast the Prelates out of all the Means they had, and without any the least Mercy to themselves, their Wives, and Children: And that in a most Ignorant, and Barbarous manner, calling them the <hi>Limbs and Members of Antichrist.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what's the Crime, which <hi>your Prelates had not the boldness to trouble you with,</hi> and in which <hi>Canterbury</hi> (that strange Man,) is <hi>so Punctual and Peremptory? O! Grave Crimen Caie Caesar!</hi> 'Tis a Charge indeed; A mighty Charge! A <hi>Novation</hi> of above Thirteen Hundred Years old. For after the Church was once formally setled under the <hi>Christian Emperours;</hi> (nay, and for some Years before) I challenge these Men to shew any Church under Heaven, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that which was promiscuously called, <hi>The Holy Table,</hi> or <hi>Altar;</hi> Or without a <hi>Font,</hi> or a <hi>Chancel,</hi> or a formal set <hi>Liturgy</hi> before Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54614:64"/>
&amp;c. And therefore if I were <hi>punctual</hi> in these, I did but my Duty. But <hi>Peremptory</hi> I am sure I was not, as well knowing the difference between things of Decency and Uniformity, and things of <hi>Necessity to Salvation.</hi> But the Charge must go on for all this.</p>

                           <hi>6.</hi> For although the words of the <hi>10 Canon, Cap. 3.</hi> be fair; yet the wicked Intentions of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Ross</hi> may be seen in the point of Justification of a Sinner before God, by comparing the <hi>Canon</hi> as it came from <hi>our Prelates,</hi> and as it was returned from <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Printed.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Here's a Confession, <hi>that the words of the</hi> 10 Canon, Cap. 3. <hi>are fair;</hi> And so they are indeed. The <hi>Canon</hi> runs thus; <hi>It is manifest, that the Superstition of former Ages is turned into great Prophaneness; and that People, for the most part, are grown cold for doing any good; esteeming that Good Works are not necessary. Therefore shall all Presbyters, as their Text gives occasion, urge the necessity of Good Works to their Hearers.</hi> These words they say are fair; and sure they are so. What's amiss then? What? Why, <hi>the wicked Intentions of</hi> Canterbury <hi>and</hi> Ross. God bless us! <hi>Wicked Intentions</hi> under such fair words? Now God forbid. I hope <hi>Ross</hi> had none; I am sure <hi>Canterbury</hi> had not. But how come they to be Judges of our <hi>Intentions?</hi> How? Why, they say, <hi>they may be seen in the point of the Justification of a Sinner before God.</hi> That's a high Point, and a dangerous, for any Man to have <hi>Wicked Intentions</hi> about it. How then may our <hi>Wicked Intentions</hi> be seen? Why, <hi>by comparing the Canons;</hi> so they say. And I desire nothing more, than that <hi>the Book,</hi> which I perused, may be produced: And upon sight of it, I will acknowledge and make good whatsoever I did; or humbly crave Pardon for what I cannot make good. And though I cannot get to see <hi>the Book,</hi> yet you shall hear the Comparison.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Our Prelates say thus:</hi> It is manifest, that the Superstitions of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages, are turned into a great Prophaneness, and that People are grown cold, for the most part, in doing any good; thinking there is no place for Good Works, because they are excluded from Justification. Therefore shall all Ministers, as their Text gives occasion, urge the necessity of Good Works, as they would be Saved; and remember that they are, <hi>Via Regni,</hi> the Way to the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis non sint Causa Regnandi,</hi> howbeit they be not the Cause of our Salvation.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>How the <hi>Canon</hi> goes now, is manifest in the words preceeding: How it went before in the Copy which their Prelates sent, is now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed. And if it be fairly related, here are two things Charged to be left out. The one is this passage, <hi>Because they are Excluded from Justification.</hi> And the other is, that known place of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> That <hi>Good Works are Via Regni, non Causa Regnandi.</hi> Now I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, both these Passages may be left out of this <hi>Canon,</hi> without any <hi>Wicked Intentions in either</hi> Canterbury <hi>or</hi> Ross <hi>against the point of Justification.</hi> But let the Charge proceed.</p>

                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:54614:65"/>
                        <p>Here <hi>Ross</hi> gives his Judgment, that he would have this Canon simply commanding Good Works to be Preached, and no mention made what place they have or have not in Justification. Vpon this motion so agreeable to <hi>Canterbury's</hi> mind, the Canon is set down, as it stands, without the distinction of <hi>Via Regni, &amp; Causa Regnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> or any word sounding that way, urging only the Necessity of Good Works.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Well! now at last I see the bottom of this Charge: And I see too, that too many Men are shye of <hi>Good Works;</hi> and for fear more should be attributed to them, than is fit, refuse to acknowledge that which is due unto them. But sure I am, there is a Command, and more than one, expresly, <hi>in the Text,</hi> for the doing of <hi>Good Works,</hi> and that <hi>without any distinction.</hi> And so I conceive the <hi>Scripture</hi> is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant enough for this <hi>Canon,</hi> to command the Preaching of <hi>Good Works,</hi> even <hi>without any distinction</hi> at all whatsoever; since God hath so absolutely and so expresly commanded, that we should serve him in <hi>Good Works:</hi> To which <note n="a" place="margin">

                     <p>But it seems, these Men have very good Intelligence, that when I looked over these <hi>Canons</hi> (which I protest I did alone by my self, and then sent them to my Lord the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> for him to do the like) can yet tell, that <hi>here</hi> Ross <hi>gave his Judgment, and would have the Canon go absolutely, and that this being according to</hi> Canterbury's <hi>mind, so it went.</hi> Where yet I shall humbly crave leave to observe two Things. The one is; That if this be true, <hi>that</hi> Ross <hi>would have these things out:</hi> Then <hi>one of their own Prelates,</hi> and he trusted from the rest, was the Cause of this omission: And so <hi>Canterbury</hi> was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Master of the Work,</hi> nor were all things in it <hi>done by him, and no other;</hi> as is before affirmed in the beginning of the second <hi>Novation.</hi> The other thing is, the omission it self: Of which, I shall say two things. The one is; That if <hi>Ross</hi> did give that Reason, That it was fit that <hi>Canon</hi> should command the Preaching of Good Works in general, <hi>because it was a time of such Prophaneness,</hi> as is mentioned in the beginning of the <hi>Canon;</hi> I for my part, cannot but approve it. The other is, That the leaving out of that known saying of St. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard's,</hi> I humbly conceive is no fault, either in my self, or any other. For though the Speech be good, and though the Sayings of private Men, Eminent in their times, were some-times put into the <hi>Canons</hi> of National Churches; yet usually it was not so. And since themselves confess, <hi>the words of the</hi> Canon, <hi>as it now is, are fair;</hi> were any Charity in them, they would not make so foul an Interpretation of other Mens <hi>Intentions.</hi>

                        <p>Albeit <hi>Sacramental Confession,</hi> and <hi>Absolution,</hi> have been in some Places very much abused; yet if any of the People be Grieved in Mind, for any Delict or Offence committed, and for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdening of his Conscience, Confess the same to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> or <hi>Presbyter;</hi> they shall, as they are bound, Minister to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son so Confessing, all Spiritual Consolations out of the Word of God; and shall not deny him the Benefit of <hi>Absolution,</hi> after the manner which is prescribed <note n="*" place="margin">In the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice-Book both of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Again, 'tis manifest by the care taken in the preceeding <hi>Canons,</hi> that here's little or nothing of moment left <hi>Arbitrary:</hi> And then the <hi>Ordinary</hi> will fall into an Excess more dangerous to himself, than his <hi>Arbitrary Punishment</hi> can be to him that suffers it, if he

offer to <hi>Tyrannize.</hi> For this Clause, wheresoever it is inserted in <hi>Canon</hi> or <hi>Statute,</hi> (as it is in the <hi>Statutes</hi> of very many <hi>Colledges</hi>) stands but for a <hi>Proviso,</hi> that Disorderly persons may not think they shall escape Punishment, if they can cunningly keep off the Letter of the Law: And yet so, that the <hi>Arbitrary Punishment</hi> be Regulated by that, which is expressed in the <hi>Canons</hi> or the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,</hi> for Omissions or Commissions of like nature.</p>
                     <p>And therefore that which is inferred upon all this Charge, and the Particulars in it; Namely, <hi>That I went about to establish a Tyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Power in the Hands of their Prelates, either over the Worship of God, or the Souls and Goods of Men,</hi> is utterly false, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved to follow out of any of the Premises. Not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Goods of the People; For no <hi>Prelate,</hi> not invested with Temporal Power, can meddle with them; so that were there any <hi>Canon</hi> made for that, it would be void of it self. Nor over the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men; for they are left free in all things, save to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Sin and Disorder; which to repress by <hi>Canons</hi> is, and hath been, the Church way. Much less over the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> For these <hi>Canons</hi> have laboured nothing so much, as to Honour, and Establish that in Decency and Uniformity. And as for that which follows, That these <hi>Canons over-turn from the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the whole Order of their Kirk;</hi> 'Tis more than I believe will be proved, that they have over-turned any good Order in their Church, much less <hi>Foundations:</hi> Though it may be thought by some, (and perhaps justly,) that there is so little Order in their Church, and that so weakly founded, that it may be over-turned with no great stress. And <hi>for the large Entry made for the Gross Novations af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,</hi> you see what it is: And when you have considered the <hi>Gross Novations,</hi> which are said to come after; I hope you will not find them <hi>very Gross,</hi> nor any way fit to be alledged <hi>as a main Cause of this Combustion.</hi> Now follows</p>

                     <p>Now we are come to the Arraignment of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and the <hi>Book of Common-Prayer;</hi> and this (they say) <hi>was brought in without Warrant from their Kirk.</hi> If this be true; it was the fault of your own Prelates, and theirs only, for ought I know. For though I like the <hi>Book</hi> exceeding well, and hope I shall be able to maintain any thing that is in it, and wish with all my Heart, that it had been entertained there; yet I did ever desire, it might come to them with their own liking and approbation. Nay, I did ever, upon all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, call upon the <hi>Scottish Bishops,</hi> to do nothing in this Particular, but by Warrant of Law. And farther, I professed unto them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54614:67"/>
                        <hi>His Majesty,</hi> that though I had obeyed his Commands in help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Order that <hi>Book;</hi> yet since I was ignorant of the Laws of that Kingdom, I would have nothing at all to do with the manner of introducing it; but left that wholly to them, who do, or should, understand both <hi>that Church,</hi> and <hi>their Laws.</hi> And I am sure, they told me, they would adventure it no way but that which was Legal. But they go on; And say, <hi>this Book</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>Is found by our National Assembly, besides the <hi>Popish</hi> Frame, and Forms in Divine Worship, to contain many <hi>Popish</hi> Errors and Ceremonies, and the Seeds of manifold and gross Superstitions, and Idolatries; and to be repugnant to the Doctrine, Discipline, and Order of our <hi>Reformation,</hi> to the Confession of Faith, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of General Assemblies, and Acts of Parliament Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing the true Religion. That this was also <hi>Canterbury's</hi> Work, we make manifest.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is a great Charge upon the <hi>Service-Book</hi> indeed: But it is in <hi>Generals,</hi> and those only affirmed, not proved. And therefore may with the same case, and as justly, be denied by me, as they are affirmed by them. And this is all I shall say, till they bring their Proofs. And though this be no more <hi>Canterbury's</hi> Work, than the <hi>Canons</hi> were; yet, by their good will, I shall bear the burden of all. And therefore, before they go to prove this great Charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Service-Book;</hi> they go on to <hi>make it manifest, that this was my</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="margin">How far this was my Work, you may see afterwards.</note> 
                        <hi>Work:</hi> And so far as it was mine, I shall ingenuously and freely acknowledge in each Particular, as occasion shall be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me. But how do they make it manifest, it was my Work? Why;

                     </p>
                     <p>This Proof comes very short. For considering the <hi>Scottish Bishops</hi> were Commanded by <hi>His Majesty</hi> to let me see, from time to time, what they did in that <hi>Service-Book;</hi> they had good reason (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) to give me some <hi>Account of their Diligence</hi> and Care in that behalf: And yet this will never conclude the Work to be mine.

                              <hi>2.</hi> By the approbation of the <hi>Service-Book</hi> sent unto them, and of all the Marginal Corrections, wherein it varies from the <hi>English-Book;</hi> shewing their desire to have some few things changed in it, which notwithstanding was not granted.

                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Argument is as loose as the former. For I hope, though I had had nothing at all to do with <hi>that Book;</hi> yet I might have <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved both the Book it self, and all the Marginal (or other) Corrections,</hi>

                        <hi>wherein it differs from,</hi> (so it be not contrary to) <hi>the English Book:</hi> Therefore my approving it will not make me the Author of it.

And if <hi>this Change were not granted,</hi> that was not my fault, but their own; who might have changed what they pleased, whether I would or no. But they should do well, to shew <hi>this Paper under</hi> St. Andrews <hi>Hand, and nine other Bishops.</hi> For my part, as I remember it not, so I believe it not. But they hope to prove it better—

                              <hi>3.</hi> By <hi>Canterbury's</hi> own Letters, witnesses of his Joy, when the Book was ready for the Press; of his Prayers that God would speed the work; of his hope to see that <hi>Service</hi> set up in <hi>Scotland;</hi> of his diligence in sending for the Printer, and directing him to prepare a Black Letter, and to send it to his Servants at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> for Printing this <hi>Book;</hi> of his Approbation of the Proofs sent from the Press; of his fear of delay <note n="*" place="margin">
                                 <hi>In,</hi> Rushw &amp; Pryn.</note> for bringing this work speedily to an end, for the great good (not of <hi>that Church</hi>) but of <hi>the Church;</hi> of his incouraging <hi>Ross,</hi> who was intrusted with the Press, to go on <note n="†" place="margin">
                                 <hi>In,</hi> Rushw. &amp; Pryn.</note> with this piece of Service, without fear of Enemies. All which may be seen in the Autographs.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Argument is as weak as any of the former. Indeed, it is nothing but a heap of <hi>Non Sequiturs. My Letters express my Joy, when the</hi> Book <hi>was ready for the Press:</hi> Therefore I made the Book. As if I might not be glad, that a <hi>Good Book</hi> was ready for the Press; but I must be the Author of it. Next, <hi>I prayed, that God would speed the Work:</hi> I did indeed, and heartily: but may not I humbly desire God to bless a Good Work, though I be not the Author of it? Yea, <hi>but I hoped to see that</hi> Service <hi>set up in</hi> Scotland. I did indeed, and was heartily sorry when my hopes failed: And that <hi>Nation</hi> will one day have more cause to be sorry for it, than I. But what then? It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not thence, that the Work was mine. Again, <hi>I was diligent with the Printer to prepare Letters, and send to his Servants.</hi> I was indeed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent herein; but it was at the intreaty of my Brethren the <hi>Scottish Bishops.</hi> And truly I could do little for them, the <hi>Printer</hi> being then in <hi>England,</hi> If I would not send to him, and desire him to be diligent. <hi>Yea, but I Approved the Proofs that were sent from the Press.</hi> And there was good Reason I should, if they were well done. But I hope, many a Man takes care of the Proofs from the Press, though the Work be not his.</p>
                     <p>The next they would fain have seem something; but 'tis no better than the rest. For they would prove <hi>this Book</hi> was my work, because <hi>I feared delay; whereas, I would have a speedy end for the Good of (not</hi> that Church, <hi>but)</hi> the Church. Fear of delay, is no proof that the work was mine. But do you not mark the subtlety? <hi>For the good of</hi> the Church, <hi>not</hi> that Church. They would fain have some Mystery hid here; but sure there is none. For if I writ any such thing, <hi>The Church,</hi> and <hi>That Church,</hi> were the same Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi> For when a Man writes to a Learned Man of another <hi>Nation,</hi> and desires
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54614:68"/>
any thing to be done for the good of <hi>the Church;</hi> he is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, of the good of <hi>that Church;</hi> unless some circumstance sway his meaning another way; which is not here. Yea, <hi>but I incouraged</hi> Ross, <hi>who was intrusted with the Press, to go on without fear of Enemies:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the work was mine. Will not young Novices laugh at this Logick? Well, they say <hi>all this appears in the Autographo.</hi> Let them shew the <hi>Autographon:</hi> And if all this be there, then you see all is nothing; they have shewed but their Weakness to collect so poorly. And if it be not there, then they have shewed their Falshood, with which some of them are too well acquainted. But prove it good, or bad; another proof they have. And that is,

                     <p>This Argument is <hi>much ado about nothing:</hi> In which, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I shall observe some passages, and then come to the force of the Argument, such as it is. And first, though the business of <hi>the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> be over, yet a Merriment in the Bishop of <hi>London's</hi> Letter must be brought in. Secondly, Though by this Letter of the <hi>Prelate of London,</hi> it be manifest, he had to do with those <hi>Canons</hi> as well as I; and though he past as full and as Honourable a Censure upon them, as I do in any Letter of mine; yet against their Knowledge, and their Conscience, they avouch peremptorily before, <hi>that this was done by</hi> Cant. <hi>and no other;</hi> and all this, to heap all the Envy they could upon me alone. Thirdly, Here's the same Phrase used by my Lord of <hi>London,</hi> that was used a little before by me: Namely, that <hi>these Canons would be for the good of the Kirk.</hi> And yet here's never a wise Observation upon it, as was upon me; <hi>that they would be for the good (not of that Church, but) of the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now for the force of Mr. <hi>Henderson's Logick</hi> (for these Arguments out of doubt are his:) Ross <hi>writ to the Prelate of</hi> London, <hi>to have from</hi> Canterbury <hi>an Explanation of some passages of the Service-Book, because the Press staid; and he obtained them; Therefore this Book was</hi> Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's <hi>work, as is before asserted.</hi> Certainly, if Mr. <hi>Henderson</hi> had any Learning in him, he would be ashamed of this stuff. <hi>Ross</hi> sent to me for the Explanation of some things, which perhaps were my <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> or <hi>Alterations</hi> in that <hi>Book,</hi> and used the <hi>Prelate of</hi> London for his means, and the Press staid, and I know not what? As if any of this could make me Author of that <hi>Book:</hi> Which yet if I were, I would neither deny, nor be ashamed of. Howsoever, he should do well to let <hi>Canterbury</hi> alone, and answer the Learned <hi>Divines of</hi> Aberdeen; who have laid him and all that <hi>Faction,</hi> open enough to

                           <hi>5.</hi> But <hi>(say they)</hi> the Book it self, as it standeth interlined, margined, and patched up, is much more than all that is expressed in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and the Changes and Supplements themselves, taken from the Mass-Book, and other <hi>Romish</hi> Rituals, by which he makes it to vary from the Book of <hi>England,</hi> are more pregnant Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of his <hi>Popish</hi> Spirit, and Wicked Intentions, which he would have put in Execution upon us, than can be denyed.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>In the next place, the <hi>Book</hi> it self is brought in Evidence; <hi>and that's a greater Evidence, than all that is expressed in my Letters.</hi> A greater Evidence! But of what? Not that the <hi>Book</hi> was of my sole making, which they have hitherto gone about to prove, and which the former part of this Argument would seem to make good. But now, these <hi>Interlinings,</hi> and <hi>Margins,</hi> and <hi>Changes,</hi> and <hi>Supplements, are pregnant proofs of my Popish Spirit, and Wicked Intentions.</hi> First, I Praise God for it, I have no <hi>Popish Spirit:</hi> And, God bless me, as (to the utmost of my knowledge) I had no <hi>Wicked Intentions</hi> in any thing, which I did in, or about, that <hi>Service-Book.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the other stuff, which fills up this Argument, That <hi>these Changes and Supplements are taken from the Mass-Book, and other</hi> Romish <hi>Rituals; and that by these the Book is made to vary from the Book of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; I cannot hold it worth an Answer, till I see some particulars named. For in this I could retort many things, could I think it fit to put but half so much Gall into my Ink, as hath made theirs black. In the mean time, I would have them remember, that we live in a Church <hi>Reformed;</hi> not in one made <hi>New.</hi> Now all <hi>Reformation,</hi> that is good and orderly, takes away nothing from the old, but that which is Faulty and Erroneous. If any thing be good, it leaves that standing. So that if these Changes from the <hi>Book of</hi> England be good, 'tis no matter whence they be taken. For every line in the <hi>Mass-Book,</hi> or other <hi>Popish Rituals,</hi> are not all Evil and Corruptions. There are many good Prayers in them; nor is any thing Evil in them, only because 'tis there. Nay, the less alteration is made in the Publick Ancient <hi>Service</hi> of the Church, the better it is; provided that nothing Superstitious or Evil in it self, be admitted or retained. And this is enough, till I see particulars charged: Yet with this; That these <hi>Variations</hi> were taken, either from the first Book of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. which was not <hi>Popery;</hi> or from some Antient <hi>Liturgies,</hi> which savour'd not of <hi>Popery.</hi>

                     </q>
                     <p>That which the <hi>Large Declaration</hi> professeth, I leave the Author of it to make good. Yet whosoever was the <hi>Author,</hi> thus much I can say, and truly; That the <hi>Scottish Bishops</hi> (some of them) did often
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54614:69"/>
say to me, that the People wou'd be better satisfied by much, to have a <hi>Liturgy</hi> composed by their own <hi>Bishops,</hi> (as this was) than to have the <hi>Service-Book</hi> of <hi>England</hi> put upon them. But to what end is this added out of the <hi>Large Declaration?</hi> Why, 'tis to cast more hatred upon me. For thus they infer:

                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Book,</hi> (they say) <hi>Inverts the Order of the Communion in the Book of England.</hi> Well, and what then? To <hi>Invert</hi> the Order of some Prayers, in the Communion, or any other part of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; doth neither pervert the Prayers, nor corrupt the Worship of God. For I hope, they are not yet grown to be such super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious <hi>Cabbalists,</hi> as to think that Numbers work any thing. For so, the Prayers be all good (as 'tis most manifest these are) it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make them ill to be read in 5. 7. or 3. place, or the like; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be in such Prayers only, where the Order is essential to the Service then in hand. As for Example, to read the <hi>Absolution</hi> first, and the <hi>Confession</hi> after; and in the Communion to give the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to the People first, and read the Prayer of Consecration after. In these Cases to <hi>Invert</hi> the Order, is to <hi>Pervert</hi> the Service; but in all other ordinary Prayers, which have not such a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary dependence upon Order, first, second, or third work no great effect. And though I shall not find fault with the Order of the Prayers, as they stand in the <hi>Communion-Book</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> (for, God be thanked, 'tis well;) yet, if a Comparison must be made, I do think, the Order of the Prayers, as now they stand in the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Liturgy,</hi> to be the better, and more agreeable to use in the <hi>Primitive Church;</hi> and I believe, they which are Learned, will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it. And therefore these Men do bewray a great deal of <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Weakness,</hi> to call this a <hi>New-Communion;</hi> only because all the Prayers stand not in the same Order.</p>
                     <p>But they say; <hi>there are divers secret Reasons of this Change,</hi> in the Order. Surely there was Reason for it, else why a <hi>Change?</hi> But that there was any hidden secret Reason for it (more than that the <hi>Scottish Prelates</hi> thought fit <hi>that Book</hi> should differ in some things from ours in <hi>England;</hi> and yet that no differences could be more safe, than those which were in the Order of the Prayers; especially since both they, and we, were of Opinion, that of the two this Order came nearest to the Primitive Church) truly I neither know, nor believe.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>only Reason</hi> given of this Change, 'tis in my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a strange one. 'Tis, forsooth, <hi>for no other end</hi> (they say) <hi>but that the Memorial and Sacrifice of Praise mentioned in it may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood according to the</hi> Popish <hi>meaning, not of the Spiritual Sacrifice, but of the Oblation of the Body of the Lord.</hi> Now Ignorance, and Jealousie, whither will you? For <hi>the Sacrifice of Praise and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,</hi> no Man doubts, but that is to be Offer'd up: Nor doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man of Learning question it, that I know, but that according to our Saviour's own Command, we are to do, whatsoever is done in this Office, <hi>as a Memorial of his Body and Blood Offered up and shed for us. S. Luc.</hi> 22. Now 'tis one thing to Offer up <hi>his Body,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">S. Lu. <hi>22. 19.</hi>
                        </note> and another to Offer up <hi>the Memorial of his Body,</hi> with our Praise, and Thanks, for that infinite Blessing: So that were that Change of Order made for this end, (which is more than I know) I do not yet see, how any <hi>Popish Meaning,</hi> so much feared, can be fastned
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54614:70"/>
upon it. And the Words in that Prayer are plain, (as they are also in the Book of <hi>England</hi>) That <hi>we offer and present unto God, our Selves, our Souls and Bodies, to be a reasonable, holy, and lively Sacrifice unto him.</hi> What is there here, that can be drawn to a <hi>Popish Meaning,</hi> unless it be with the cords of these Mens Vanity? Yet thus much we have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them; That <hi>this Prayer comes in the Book of</hi> England <hi>perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently after the Communion.</hi> Any approbation is well of that <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Service-Book</hi> (as 'tis often called:) And I verily believe, we should not have gained this Testimony of them for it, but only that they are content to approve that, to make the greater hatred against their own. Next they tell us—

                              <hi>2.</hi> It seems to be no great matter, that without warrant of the Book of <hi>England,</hi> the Presbyter going from the North end of the Table, shall stand during the time of Consecration, at such a part of the Table, where he may with the more ease and decency use both his Hands; Yet being tryed, it importeth much: As that he must stand with his hinder parts to the People; representing (saith <hi>Durand</hi>) that which the Lord said to <hi>Moses, Thou shalt see my hinder parts.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Truly, this Charge is, as it seems, <hi>no great matter.</hi> And yet here again they are offended, that this is done <hi>without warrant of the Book of</hi> England. How comes this <hi>Book of</hi> England to be so much in their esteem, that nothing must be done without warrant from it? Why, 'tis not that they approve <hi>that Book,</hi> for they will none of that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But 'tis only, to make their Complaint more acceptable in <hi>England.</hi> Yet they say, <hi>this very remove of the Presbyter during the time of Consecration, upon tryal imports much.</hi> The Rubrick professes, that nothing is meant by it, but <hi>that he may use both his Hands with more ease and decency about that work.</hi> And I protest in the presence of <hi>Almighty God,</hi> I know of no other Intention herein, than this. But these Men can tell more. They are sure it is, <hi>that he may turn his hinder parts to the People, representing that which the Lord said to</hi> Moses. And what Warrant have they for this? Why <hi>Durand</hi> says so. Now truly the more Fool he. And they shall do well to ask their own <hi>Bishops,</hi> what acquaintance they have with <hi>Durand?</hi> For as for my self, I was so poorly satisfied with the first Leaf I Read in him, that I never medled with him since. Nor indeed, do I spend any time in such <hi>Authors</hi> as he is. So I have nothing to do with this. Yea, but they find fault with the Reason given in the <hi>Rubrick.</hi> For they say—
<q>
                           <p>He must have the use of both his Hands, not for any thing he hath to do about the Bread and the Wine; (for that <note n="*" place="margin">Must, <hi>Rushw.</hi>
                              </note> may be done at the North end of the Table, and be better seen of the People.) But (as we are taught by the <hi>Rationalists</hi>) That he may be stretching <note n="†" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Forth,</hi> Rushw. &amp; Pryn.</note> out his Arms, represent the extension of <hi>Christ</hi> on the Cross.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Reason given in the <hi>Rubrick</hi> doth not satisfie them: For they say plainly, <hi>They have no use of both their Hands, for any thing that</hi>
                        <pb n="117" facs="tcp:54614:70"/>
                        <hi>is to be done about the Bread and the Wine.</hi> Surely these Men Consecrate these <hi>Elements</hi> in a very loose and mean way, if they can say truly, <hi>that they have not use of both their Hands</hi> in this work. Or, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is done, <hi>may as well be done at the North end of the Table;</hi> which in most places is too narrow, and wants room, to lay the <hi>Service-Book</hi> open before him that Officiates, and to place the <hi>Bread and Wine within</hi> his reach. So that in that place 'tis hard for the Presbyter to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the unseemly disordering of something, or other, that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, perhaps the very <hi>Elements</hi> themselves; which may give Scandal to them which come to Communicate: Especially, since in the Margin of the <hi>Prayer of Consecration,</hi> he is ordered to lay his Hand upon the Bread and the Wine, which he Consecrates. As for <hi>his being better seen of the People;</hi> that varies according to the Nature of the Place, and the Position of the <hi>Table:</hi> So that in some Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he may be better seen, and in some not. Though I am not of Opinion, that it is any End of the Administration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>to have the Priest better seen of the People.</hi> Thus much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Viz.</hi> Their Argument Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Reason of the Posture of the Priest, given in <hi>the Rubrick,</hi> H. W.</note> Reason given in the <hi>Rubrick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Next, they produce other Reasons of this Position of his at the <hi>Holy-Table.</hi> And first, they say, 'tis not for the more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent use of both his Hands, in the Celebration of that Work: But it is (say they) <hi>that he may, by stretching out his Arms, represent the Extension of</hi> Christ <hi>on the Cross.</hi> Why, but I say not this; nor is there any such thing Ordered or Required in the <hi>Book;</hi> nor doth any <hi>English</hi> Divine practise this that I know. Why then is this Charged upon me? Nor is it sufficient for them to say, <hi>they are taught thus by the Rationalists;</hi> unless I did affirm, or practise, as those <hi>Rationalists</hi> do. Here's a great deal of Charity want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But they bring another Reason, as good as this is: And that is—
<q>
                           <p>That he may the more conveniently lift up the Bread and Wine <note n="†" place="margin">

                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Good God! whither tends this Malice? There is not a Word in the <hi>Book</hi> of this neither: <hi>Not of lifting the Bread and Wine over his Head;</hi> much less is there any thing, <hi>to have it Adored by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> And as there is nothing in the <hi>Book,</hi> so nothing hath ever been said, or done, by me, that tends this way. Now, if none of this hath been said, or done by me; what means this? Sure they mean to charge the <hi>Rationalists</hi> with this, and not me; unless I did by Word, or Deed, approve them herein. Yea, but <hi>a little before, in the Rubrick of</hi> General Confession, <hi>the People are directed to kneel humbly on their Knees.</hi> That's true: And what Posture so fit, as that which is Humble, when Men are making Confession of their Sins to God? But that which follows, namely, <hi>that the Priest's Elevation, and the Peoples Adoration, may go together,</hi> is utterly false. There is not one Word of it in the <hi>Rubrick,</hi> nor ever was there
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54614:71"/>
one Thought of it in my self, or (as I verily believe) in any of the Compilers of that <hi>Book.</hi> And 'tis well known, that through the whole <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the Form is to receive that Blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Kneeling;</hi> and yet without any <hi>Adoration</hi> at all <hi>of the Bread and Wine.</hi> So this Charge, which way soever it look, cannot hit me. However, God forgive this Malice. For are <hi>the People directed to Kneel, to the end the Priest's Elevation, and the Peoples Adoration, may go together?</hi> why then so let them go: For the Priest with us makes no <hi>Elevation;</hi> nor therefore the People any <hi>Adoration,</hi> of those Elements. But there is yet more behind: For they say—
<q>
                           <p>That in this Posture, speaking with a low Voice, and muttering (for at some times he is Commanded to speak with a loud voice, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly) he be not heard by the People; which is no less a mocking of God and his People, than if the Words were spoken in an unknown Language.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This again, by my Accusers good leave, is utterly false. For there is no <hi>Rubrick</hi> in the whole <hi>Book,</hi> that commands the Priest to use a <hi>muttering or low Voice.</hi> This therefore is drawn in only by consequence, and that an ill one. As if, because he is sometimes commanded to speak aloud, he were thereby enjoyned, in other parts of the Service, to speak with a low Voice; which is not so. In the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in some places the <hi>Minister</hi> is directed before he begins the Prayer, to say, <hi>Let us Pray;</hi> which is but to keep their Attention waking; and to put them in mind what they are doing, or ought to do. And shall any Man infer upon this, <hi>Let us Pray;</hi> therefore they were not at Prayer before? So here, if in some principal part of the Service, there be a Caveat given, that <hi>the Presbyter shall speak with a loud Voice, and Distinctly:</hi> (I say [<hi>If</hi>] for I do not yet find the <hi>Rubrick</hi> where it is) It implies, That he be very careful in that place, that his Voice be Audible and Distinct; but it imports not, that therefore in other parts of the Service, it may be low, or confused, or unheard. And yet, if such a Consequence were to be drawn; 'tis no new thing in the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> that the Minister did Pray sometimes in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Assembly, in a very low Voice, if at all Audible. For it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the <note n="*" place="margin">

But howsoever, in the Publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that all should be Publick, I rather approve.</p>
                     <p>As for that which follows; <hi>That to utter the Common Service of the Church in a low voice, not heard by the People, is no less a mocking of God, and his People, than if the Words were spoken in an Unknown Tongue:</hi> This were well Charged, if any Man did command that the <hi>Publick Service</hi> should be Read in so low a voice, that the People might not hear it. But since no Man, that I know, approves it, and since there is nothing in the <hi>Book</hi> that requires it; I know not to what end 'tis
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54614:71"/>
urged here. And yet this by their leave too; were Prayers Read in so low a voice, <hi>it were a mocking of the People</hi> I confess, to call them to Church, and not let them hear. But how either Prayer in a low voice, or a Tongue unknown to the People, should be a mocking of God, I cannot conceive; unless these Men think (as <hi>Elias</hi> put it upon the Prophets of <hi>Baal</hi>) That <hi>their God is talking, or journeying, or perhaps sleeping, and must be awaked before he can hear;</hi> or, that any Tongue unknown to the People, is unknown to God also. But this I presume they will not dare to say, if it be but for that of St. <hi>Paul; He that speaks in the Church in an unknown tongue, speaks not unto Men, for they understand him not;</hi> yet <hi>he speaks to God,</hi> and doubtless doth not mock him; for <hi>he edifies himself; and in the Spirit speaks Mysteries:</hi> neither of which can stand with the <hi>mocking of God.</hi> Now say they—
<q>
                           <p>As there is no word of all this in the <hi>English Service;</hi> so doth the Book in <hi>King Edward's</hi> Time, give to every Presbyter his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Gesture: which yet gave such offence to <hi>Bucer</hi> (the Censurer of the Book, and even in <hi>Cassander</hi> his own Judgment, a Man of great Moderation in Matters of this kind) that he calleth them, <hi>Nunquam-satis-execrandos Missae gestus;</hi> and would have them to be abhorred, because they confirm to the Simple and Superstitious, <hi>ter-impiam &amp; exitialem Missae fiduciam.</hi>

Why, first <hi>the Charge here, is made a work of God's Omnipotency.</hi> Well, and a work of <hi>Omnipotency</hi> it is, what ever the <hi>Change</hi> be. For less than <hi>Omnipotence</hi> cannot <hi>Change</hi> those Elements, either in <hi>Nature,</hi> or <hi>Vse,</hi> to so high a Service as they are put in that great Sacrament. And therefore the Invocating of God's Almighty Goodness to effect this by them, is no proof at all, of intending the <hi>Corporal Presence of</hi> Christ <hi>in this Sacrament.</hi> 'Tis true, this passage is not in the Prayer of Consecration in the <hi>Service-Book of England;</hi> but I wish with all my Heart it were. For though the Consecration of the Elements may be without it; yet is it much more solemn and full by that <hi>Invocation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, these words (they say) intend the Corporal Presence of <hi>Christ</hi> in the Sacrament, because the Words in the Mass are <note n="*" place="margin">

For if it be only, <hi>ut fiant nobis,</hi> that they may be to us, the Body and the Blood of <hi>Christ;</hi> it implies clearly, that they <hi>are to us,</hi> but are not <hi>Transubstantiated in themselves,</hi> into the Body and Blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> nor that there is any <hi>Corporal</hi> Presence, in, or under the <hi>Elements.</hi> And then nothing can more cross the Doctrine of the present Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than their own <hi>Service.</hi> For as the Elements after the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction, or Consecration, are, and may be called, the Body and Blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> without any addition, in that real and true Sense in which they are so called in Scripture: So, when they are said to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Body and the Blood of Christ, <hi>nobis,</hi> to us that <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> as we ought; there is by this addition, <hi>fiant nobis,</hi> an allay in the proper signification of the Body and Blood: And the true Sense, so well signified and expressed, that the words cannot well be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood otherwise, than to imply not the <hi>Corporal Substance,</hi> but the <hi>Real,</hi> and yet the Spiritual use of them. And so the words, <hi>ut fiant</hi>
                        <pb n="122" facs="tcp:54614:73"/>
                        <hi>nobis,</hi> import quite contrary to that which they are brought to prove. And I hope, that which follows, will have no better success.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>On the other side, the Expressions of the Book of <hi>England,</hi> at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of the Elements; of feeding on <hi>Christ</hi> by Faith; and of eating and drinking in remembrance that <hi>Christ</hi> died for thee, are utterly deleted.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Before, they went about to prove an intendment to establish the Doctrine of <hi>the Corporal Presence of</hi> Christ <hi>in the Sacrament,</hi> by some positive words: And here they go about to prove the same by the omission of some other words of the <hi>Book of</hi> England. For they say (and 'tis true) that those words are expressed in the <hi>English Liturgy,</hi> at the delivery of the Elements, and are left out of the <hi>Book</hi> prepared for <hi>Scotland.</hi> But it is altogether false, either that this omission was intended to help to make good a <hi>Corporal Presence;</hi> or that a <hi>Corporal Presence</hi> can by any good consequence be proved out of it. For the first, <hi>of feeding on</hi> Christ <hi>by Faith,</hi> if that omission be thought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage any thing toward a <hi>Corporal Presence;</hi> surely, neither the <hi>Scottish Bishops,</hi> nor my self, were so simple to leave it out here, and keep these words in <note n="*" place="margin">In the Collect of Thanksgiving after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving.</note> immediately after; <hi>that thou dost vouchsafe to feed us, which have duly received those Holy Mysteries, with the Spiritual food of the most precious Body and Blood of thy Son.</hi> For <hi>the feeding on Christ by Faith,</hi> and <hi>the Spiritual Food of the Body and Blood of Christ,</hi> are all one; and 'tis hard, that the asserting of a <hi>Spiritual Food,</hi> should be made the proof a <hi>Corporal Presence;</hi> or, that the omitting of it in one place, should be of greater force, than the affirming it in another. The like is to be said of the second omission, <hi>of eating and drinking in remembrance that</hi> Christ <hi>died for us.</hi> For that remembrance of his Death and Passion, is expressed almost immediately <note n="†" place="margin">In the Prayer of Consecration.</note> before. And would not this have been omitted as well as the other; had there been an intention to forget this remembrance, and to introduce a <hi>Corporal Presence?</hi> Besides, St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself, in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. adds this, <hi>in</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">a <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 24. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>remembrance of me:</hi> But in the 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>The Cup of blessing, which we bless, is it not the Communion of the Blood of Christ? The Bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of Christ?</hi> Which Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation there, is a pressing Affirmation; and these words <hi>in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Christ,</hi> are omitted. And what then will these my Learned Adversaries say, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> omitted this to establish a <hi>Corporal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence?</hi> I hope they will not.</p>
                     <p>But whatsoever this <hi>omission</hi> may be thought to work; it cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon me. For when I shall come to set down, (as I purpose God willing to do) <hi>the brief Story,</hi> what hand I had in this <hi>Liturgy for Scotland;</hi> it shall then appear, that I laboured to have the <hi>English Liturgy</hi> sent them, without any <hi>Omission</hi> or <hi>Addition</hi> at all, this or any other; that so the Publick Divine Service might, in all his <hi>Majesty's</hi> Dominions, have been one and the same. But some of the <hi>Scottish Bishops</hi> prevail'd herein against me; and some Alterations they would have from the <hi>Book of</hi> England, and this was one; as I have to shew under the then Bishop of <hi>Dunblain's</hi> Hand, Dr. <hi>Wetherborne,</hi> whose
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54614:73"/>
Notes I have yet by me, concerning the Alterations in that <hi>Service-Book.</hi> And concerning this particular, his words are these:

And if there be no more in ours, <hi>the Action</hi> will be much the shorter. Besides, the words which are added since, <hi>take, eat in remembrance,</hi> &amp;c. may seem to relish some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Tenet, That the Sacrament is a bare Sign  taken in remembrance of <hi>Christ's</hi> Passion.</q> So that for my part, First, I see no hurt in the omission of those latter words, none at all: And next, if there be any, it proceeded not from me.

First, I think no Man doubts, but that there is, and ought to be offered up to God at the Consecration and Reception of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, <hi>Sacrificium Laudis,</hi> the Sacrifice of Praise: And that this ought to be expressed in the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> for the Instruction of the People.

And I do desire them, that notwithstanding this is <hi>Hora vestra, &amp; Potestas Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarum,</hi> their most convenient time; that they will discover any thing which they have more to say. But the Truth is; here's nothing in this threatned Heap, but Cunning and Malice. For they would seem to reckon up many things; but divers of them are little different, as <hi>Missa Sicca,</hi> and <hi>Communicating in one kind.</hi> And neither these, nor any of the rest, offered with any Proof; nor indeed are they able to prove, that any Grounds are laid for any one of them, in <hi>that Service-Book.</hi> And for my own part, I have

                     <p>Their Supplications against these <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>Canons</hi> and the <hi>Service,</hi> were many indeed: But how well qualified, (the matter duly considered) I leave to them, who shall take the pains to look into them. And howsoever, most untrue it is, <hi>that I caused them to be answered with Horrible Proclamations.</hi> Nor were they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained by any thing that I know, but their own wilfulness, to use the Churlish Remedy of <hi>Protestation</hi> against their Sovereigns Lawful Power in Lawful Things. They add, <hi>that for their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations, and other Lawful Means, which they used for their Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> Canterbury <hi>procured them to be proclaimed Rebels.</hi> Now tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I know no other Lawful means, that they used, but <hi>taking up of Arms</hi> professedly against the <hi>King:</hi> And I for my part do not conceive, that Lawful for Subjects to do, in any Cause, of Religion, or otherwise; and this I am sure, was the Ancient <hi>Christian</hi> Doctrine</p>
                     <p>And yet when they had taken up <hi>Arms,</hi> I did not procure them <hi>to be declarered Rebels, and Traytors.</hi> The Proclamation for that went out by Common Advise of the <hi>Lords of the Council;</hi> and their carriage at that time deserv'd it plentifully; let them paint over that Action how they can.

This Article about the breach of the <hi>Pacification,</hi> the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> have thought fit to make a part of their Charge against me: And therefore I shall put off the main of my <hi>Answer,</hi> till I come to those <hi>Articles.</hi> In the mean time thus much in brief I shall say to some circumstantial things in this Charge. And first, I do not think, that any thing can be said <hi>to be Privately spoken at the Council-Table,</hi> that is openly delivered there, in the hearing <hi>of his Majesty</hi> and all the Lords present: And so was all which I spake there. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they say, I did <hi>openly, and often speak of them</hi> (the Scots) <hi>as of Rebels and Traytors.</hi> That indeed is true; I did so: And I spake as I then thought, and as I think still. For it was as desperate a plotted Treason, as ever was in any Nation. And if they did not think so themselves, what needed <hi>their Act of Oblivion in Scotland?</hi> or the like in <hi>England,</hi> to secure their Abetters here? Thirdly, For the <hi>Pacification at Barwick,</hi> whatever I said touching the Dishonour of it (as shall after appear) yet no Man can truly Charge me, that I said, <hi>it was meet to be broken.</hi> Fourthly, I had no Malignity answerable to <hi>their bitterness</hi> against <hi>the Church of England;</hi> nor did <hi>the entring upon a new War</hi> proceed from my Counsels; nor did I give farther way to it, than all <hi>the Lords of the Junto did.</hi> Lastly, it is manifest here, how truly <hi>the King</hi> was dealt with on all Hands. For here ye see, they take on them to know, not only what was done at the <hi>Council-Table,</hi> but what was said also at <hi>the private Junto:</hi> When in all that time <hi>his Majesty</hi> could get no information of any thing, that proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Scotland.</hi> But they proceed yet farther against me.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>By him was it, that our <hi>Covenant,</hi> approven by National Assemblies, Subscribed by <hi>his Majesty's</hi> Commissioner, and by the Lords of <hi>his Majesty's</hi> Council, and by them commanded to be Subscribed by all the Subjects of the Kingdom, as a Testimony of our Duty to God and the King: By him was it still called, <hi>Ungodly, Damnable, Treasonable:</hi> By him were Oaths invented, and pressed upon divers of our poor Countrymen, upon the pain of Imprisonment, and many [ <note n="*" place="margin">Rushw.</note> other] Miseries, which were unwarranted by Law, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their National Oath.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>This their <hi>Covenant</hi> indeed, as it was made at first, without at least, if not against, <hi>the King,</hi> I did utterly dislike. And if I did say, it was <hi>Vngodly, Damnable, and Treasonable;</hi> I said no more than it deserved. Nor was it any thing the better, but much the worse, if (as it was so made at first) <hi>it were approved by National Assemblies:</hi> For that was but the greater sign, that the Rebellious Faction grew stronger.

Nor was there any <hi>Oath invented or pressed by me upon their Countrymen, unwarrantable by Law;</hi> for I neither invented nor pressed any: But whatsoever was done in this kind, was done by Publick Authority at the <hi>Council Table.</hi> And if any <hi>Oath,</hi> tendred to them there, were contrary to their <hi>National Oath;</hi> I doubt it will easily be found, that their <hi>National Oath</hi> (if such it be)
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54614:75"/>
was contrary to their due and Natural Allegiance. But what's next? Why, this:
<q>
                           <p>When our <hi>Commissioners</hi> did appear to render the Reasons of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; he spared not, in the presence of the King and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, to rail against our National Assembly, as not daring to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the World and Kirks abroad; where himself and his Actions were able to indure tryal: And against our just and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Defence, as the most malicious and treasonable Contempt of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical Government, that any by-gone Age had heard of. His hand also was at the Warrant of Restraint and Imprisonment of our Commissioners, sent from the Parliament, warranted by the King, and seeking the Peace of the Kingdom.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are divers things in this part of the Charge. And the first is, <hi>that I railed at their National Assembly, in the presence of the King and the Committee.</hi> But that under favour is not so. Nor is it my fashion to rail at any body, much less in such a Presence. I was then openly taxed, and by Name, by the L. <hi>Lowdon,</hi> one of the <hi>Commissioners;</hi> and that which I said in answer to him, was in my own defence: And it was to this effect. That whatsoever their <hi>Assembly</hi> had concluded, did not much move me. For I did assure my self, nothing they could say or do, could sink my Credit in <hi>Christendom;</hi> going upon grounds, which would every where abide tryal: And I somewhat doubted, whether the Acts of their <hi>Assembly</hi> would do so; since even at home, not <hi>the Bishops</hi> only, but the Learned <hi>Divines</hi> of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> opposed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them. This was not <hi>railing</hi> against their <hi>Assembly.</hi> And if it shall be thought too much to be spoken by (though for) my self; I humbly desire the Christian Reader to remember, That even S. <hi>Paul</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor</hi> 12. 11.</note> was forced to commend himself, when false Brethren accused him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
                     <p>Next, they say, <hi>I spake against their just and necessary defence.</hi> Truly not I: That which I spake, was against their defence, as being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Just</hi> nor <hi>Necessary.</hi> And if I then said (speaking of things, as they stood then) <hi>that they were Treasonable Contempts of Monarchical Government;</hi> then, being such, their defence of them could neither be <hi>Just,</hi> nor <hi>Necessary.</hi> And truly, as they stood then I held them very desperate, against <hi>the Honour and just Power of the King.</hi> I say, as they stood then. For since <hi>his Majesty</hi> hath referred them to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <hi>Commissioners</hi> of both <hi>Nations,</hi> and out of his Clemency and Goodness, hath admitted all, or most of them, (which I believe few <hi>Kings</hi> would have done;) I have spoken nothing of them, but in Prayer, that God will graciously be pleased to turn all these things, to the Good and Peace of both Kingdoms; which must be little less than a Miracle, if he do.</p>
                     <p>As for my Hand, that <hi>it was at the Warrant of Restraint of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, sent from the Parliament,</hi> &amp;c. This also is but a meer clamour, to bring me into further hatred, which hath been their aim all along. For why else, is <hi>my Hand</hi> picked out alone; whereas, <hi>the Hands</hi> of all (for ought I know) that were then present at <hi>the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,</hi> were subscribed to that Warrant? And yet it seems, no Hand
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54614:76"/>
hath troubled them but mine. And for these <hi>Commissioners, seeking the Peace of the Kingdom,</hi> I will not offer to enter upon their Thoughts, what they sought; but leave it to future times, that will discover the success of things, and by it open the aim of the <hi>Agents,</hi> how <hi>they sought the Peace of these Kingdoms.</hi> But yet they go on—
<q>
                           <p>For when we had <hi>(say they)</hi> by our Declarations, Remonstrances, and Representations, manifested the Truth of our Intentions, and Lawfulness of our Actions to all the good Subjects of the Kingdom of <hi>England;</hi> when the late <hi>Parliament</hi>

                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>They did indeed offer by many Pamphlets, Printed and sent into England, <hi>to</hi> manifest <hi>the Truth of their Intentions;</hi> which was to join close with their Party here, and come and gain some good Booty in <hi>England:</hi> And this end they have obtained. But <hi>the lawfulness of their Actions,</hi> they neither have, nor can make good, to any Impartial and Judicious Reader of them. And whereas they say, they have made the lawfulness of them manifest, <hi>to all the good Subjects of the Kingdom of</hi> England; you must know, that they are only such <hi>English</hi> as joyn with them in their Plot, or at least <note n="†" place="margin">in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And I shall ever wish from my Heart, that the <hi>Kingdom</hi> may never be hazarded more than it hath been by my Counsels; and then, by God's Blessing, it shall be a happier <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> than the youngest now alive are like to see it, if things go on in the Track they now are.</p>
                     <p>Next they say; <hi>that without all Example, I sat still in Convocation,</hi> though the <hi>Parliament</hi> were risen: <hi>Without Example:</hi> What is that to them, if it were so? But the Arch-Bishops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> have sate in <hi>Convocation,</hi> and made <hi>Canons</hi> too, when no Parliament hath been sitting; as is most manifest by the Records of that See. Yea, but there is no Example of it since the <hi>Reformation.</hi> Be it so: Nor is it, for all that, forbidden in <hi>the Statute</hi> of the submission of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. so they sit by the King's Writ. And yet here I was so careful, as that I caused the great Lawyers of <hi>the Kingdom</hi> to be
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54614:76"/>
consulted abaut it, and followed their Judgments, as is before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed. And for the <hi>Canons</hi> which were made, they were not against them. One branch indeed of the first <hi>Canon,</hi> is <hi>against Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects bearing Arms against their King, offensive, or defensive, under any pretence whatsoever.</hi> But this, as it is the Antient Doctrine, which the Church of <hi>Christ</hi> hath ever Taught in all times and places: So is it not against them at all, unless they, against <note n="†" place="margin">

                        <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> and <hi>Natural All giance,</hi> bear Arms against their <hi>King.</hi> But if they do, or have done so; the <hi>Canon,</hi> that was not made against them, hits them full. And in this Case, let them pretend what they list, <hi>their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> can neither be <hi>Just</hi> nor <hi>Necessary.</hi> Yea, but they say farther, that I—

                     <p>This goes high indeed; if it were as full in proof, as 'tis loud in expression. But here is not one shew of Proof added, either from Reason or Authority, Divine or Humane, more than their bare word; And therefore I must answer it in the same Key. First then, 'tis true, that in the Preface of the first <hi>Canon,</hi> every Minister is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, under a Penalty, <hi>to Publish to his People the Exposition of Regal Power contained in that</hi> Canon; <hi>and this once every quarter of a Year.</hi> So then, if the Doctrine contained in that <hi>Canon</hi> be true, (and it was approved for Truth, by the whole <hi>National Synod of</hi> England;) then all this high Charge falls low enough. Besides, it will concern them to consider well, what their Proceedings have been. For as for this <hi>Canon,</hi> it is according to the Doctrine and Practice of <hi>the Primitive Church:</hi> And they, surely, were both <hi>Pious</hi> and <hi>Sound Divines</hi> that lived in it; and I, for my part, shall hold no Man a <hi>Sound Divine,</hi> that runs contrary to it.</p>
                     <p>Now, that the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> were of Opinion, <hi>that Subjects ought not to take Arms against their Kings, Offensive or Defensive, upon any pretence whatsoever</hi> (which are the words in our <note n="a" place="margin">Can. 1. <hi>sub</hi> Carolo.</note> 
                        <hi>Canon,</hi> which they are so angry with) no, not for, or under, pretence of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> see the Proofs in the Margin. <note n="b" place="margin">Plures nimirum, &amp;c. vestra omnia <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </q>
                     <p>We are now come to the last part of their Charge; and that's <hi>the Prayer,</hi> which was made and sent to be used in all Churches when the <hi>Scots</hi> came into <hi>England.</hi> But this Prayer was made not
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54614:78"/>
                        <hi>by my means,</hi> or procurement, but by his <hi>Majesties</hi> special Command to me to see it done. And it hath bin ever usual in <hi>England,</hi> upon great and urgent occasions, to have one or more Prayers made by some Bishop or Bishops, nearest hand, to fit the Present business. And this may appear by divers Forms and Prayers so made, and publickly used in all times since the <hi>Reformation.</hi> And since this <hi>Prayer</hi> was made <hi>by his Majesties</hi> own Command; I am sorry they should say of it, that <hi>Malice it self cannot ascend above it.</hi> Though I perswade my self they thought to hit me, not him in this Speech.</p>
                     <p>Now, what I pray is that, <hi>above which Malice it self cannot ascend?</hi> Why, first it is, That they were called in that Prayer, <hi>trayterous Subjects, which had cast off all Obedience to their Anointed Sovereign.</hi> Why, but <hi>Truth</hi> spake this, not Malice? For <hi>Trayterous Subjects</hi> they were then, if ever a <hi>King</hi> had any: And the <hi>Kings</hi> Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation called them so before that <hi>Prayer</hi> came forth. And what Title soever it is fit to give them now, since his <hi>Majesty</hi> hath bin graciously pleased to treat with them, and pass by their Offence, that's another thing; but as the case stood then, they had shaken off all Obedience, and were as they were then called, <hi>Trayterous Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi> And I had a special Charge from the <hi>King,</hi> not to spare that Name.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> They except against this, that 'tis there said, <hi>that they came in a Rebellious manner to Invade this Kingdom.</hi> And that is most true too; for whereas they said, they came in a peaceable manner to deliver their Petitions to the <hi>King,</hi> for the Liberty of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Laws: Is it a peaceable way to come two or three and twenty Thousand Men strong, and Armed, to deliver a Petition? Let the whole World judge, whether this were not a <hi>Rebellious Invasion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They say 'tis desir'd in the <hi>Prayer,</hi> that <hi>God would with shame cover the Faces of his, and the King's Enemies.</hi> Out of doubt, this Petition proceeds from <hi>Devotion,</hi> not from <hi>Malice.</hi> And if the <hi>Scots</hi> (when they Invaded <hi>England,</hi> upon a Treacherous Plot, and <note n="*" place="margin">Conjunction.</note> 
                        <hi>Conjuncture</hi> with the like Faction here, that so both might have their Ends against the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi>) were not <hi>God's Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> and the <hi>Kings,</hi> the <hi>Prayer</hi> meddles not with them: If they were (as for my part I must believe, if I judge by their Actions) they deserve all that can be prayed against them, so long as they continue in that Disobedience. And yet the <hi>Prayer</hi> was not (as 'tis said) <hi>against their Nation by Name:</hi> No, God forbid; their <hi>Nation</hi> hath I doubt not very many devout Servants to <hi>God,</hi> and Loyal Subjects to their <hi>King.</hi> But it was aginst that <hi>prevailing Faction</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, which in that great Rebellious Action became Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies both to <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>King.</hi> Now follows the Conclusion.</p>

                     </q>
                     <p>The Conclusion is like the rest; much said in it, and nothing proved. Where first I desire no favour, but an <hi>Impartial Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of a Discreet, Pious, and Judicious Reader, of all things done by me in the one <hi>Book</hi> or the other. Next, <hi>for the Doctrine which hath been Printed these Years past;</hi> (though little or none hath been Published by any <hi>Disciple or Emissary of mine:</hi>) I perswade my self, the Intelligent, and Impartial Reader will find it to be as sound and Orthodox, as any that hath been Printed in any so many Years since the <hi>Reformation.</hi> And if they, whom I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily to trust in that Business, have slipped any thing; they are subject to answer the Laws in that behalf. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> what <hi>gross Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery they have found in the Posthume Writings of the Prelates of</hi> Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh <hi>and</hi> Dunblaine, I know not. This I know; 'tis an Easie, but a base thing, to abuse the Dead, who cannot answer for themselves: And they which are so over-bold with the Living, may easily and justly enough be suspected not to hold over-fair quarter with the Grave.</p>
                     <p>But whereas it is said, that these <hi>worthy Men</hi> (for such they were) were <hi>my Creatures, my nearest Familiars, my willing Instruments,</hi> and the like: This I do here avow for truth; I was a meer Stranger to Dr. <hi>Forbys,</hi>

                        <hi>late Prelate of</hi> Edinburgh. The first time that ever I saw him, was when I attended as a <hi>Chaplain in Ordinary</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on King <hi>James</hi> of blessed Memory, in the Year 1617. At which time I heard him Preach very learnedly before <hi>his Majesty.</hi> After that time I never saw him, till I attended <hi>his Majesty,</hi> that now is, as <hi>Dean of his Chappel,</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the Year 1633. In the mean time I had contracted no Friendship; no Letters had passed between us. Then he Preached again very Learnedly, and his <hi>Majesty</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to make him Bishop of <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> which was done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; and to my Remembrance, he lived not above a Year after, or very little more. And this was all the <hi>near Familiarity</hi> that was between him and me.</p>
                     <p>With the Bp. of <hi>Dunblaine,</hi> Dr. <hi>Wedderborne;</hi> I confess, I had more, and longer Acquaintance; for he lived some Years in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and was recommended unto me, as a Man that had very good parts and Learning in him. He lived long with Mr. <hi>Isaac Casaubon,</hi> who was not like to teach him any <hi>Popery,</hi> and who certainly would not have retained him so long, or so near unto him, had he not found him a deserver. After I came acquainted with him, I wished him very well for his worth sake, and did what I could for him to enable him to live. But sure if my <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions were so deep,</hi> as they are after said to be, he could be no fit <hi>Instrument</hi> for me; he being a meer Scholar, and a Book-Man,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54614:79"/>
and as unfit for, as unacquainted with, such <hi>Counsels and Projects,</hi> as these Men would make me Author of. And if my <hi>Intentions were so deep;</hi> out of doubt I had Brains enough to make a wiser Choice of <hi>Instruments</hi> to advance them. This for the Men.</p>
                     <p>But for the <hi>Matter,</hi> if any posthume Papers of theirs be other than they ought; their Credit must answer for them to the World, as their Conscience hath already done to God. And for my own part, I protest I do not, nor ever did, know of any such Papers which they had, or left behind; nor do I believe, they left any behind them, but such as were worthy their Learning and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>my Intentions</hi> (they say) <hi>were deep and large against all the Reformed Kirks.</hi> Surely the <hi>deeper,</hi> the worse, if they were so ill. But as I cannot be so vain, to assume to my self any such depth: So I humbly thank God for it, I am free from all such wickedness. The worst thought I had of any <hi>Reformed Church</hi> in Christendom, was to wish it like the <hi>Church of England;</hi> and so much better, as it should please God to make it. And the <hi>deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est intention</hi> I had concerning all or any of them, was how they might not only be wished, but made so: As for <hi>the Reformation of Religion in</hi> his Majesties <hi>Dominions, which</hi> (they say) <hi>was panting, and had given up the Ghost, if God had not in a wonderful way of Mercy prevented them.</hi> First, this is, under Favour, most untrue, and a base and most undeserved Scandal put upon <hi>his Majesty's</hi> Government. Secondly, I shall take leave to Prophesy, that unless after all this Tumbling the People can be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, that all stand for matters of Religion, both Doctrine, and Discipline (and that rather with addition to the Churches Power, than detracting from it) as they then did, when these Men say <hi>the Reformation was pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and giving up the Ghost:</hi> I much doubt, that neither they, nor their Childrens Children after, shall see such Happy Days a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for all things, as these were, which they so unthankfully to God and their King, murmured against, and as these Men yet snarl at. And for the Spirit which <hi>prevented</hi> them in this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in such <hi>a wonderful way of Mercy,</hi> if ever they awake out of this Lethargy (for better it is not) they will then see whence he is, and whither he tends. They add to this—

                     <p>What, not the <hi>Pope himself?</hi> now surely he could do little then. For (as I told you in the very last Passage) I never intended more to the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> than to wish them in Doctrine and Discipline, like the <hi>Church of England.</hi> And I hope, that was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                        <hi>to Negotiate for Rome,</hi> nor <hi>to reduce them to Heresie in Doctrine,</hi> nor <hi>to Superstition and Idolatry in Worship,</hi> no, <hi>nor to Tyranny in Government.</hi> All which are here most wrongfully imputed to me. And this comparing of me with <hi>the Pope himself,</hi> I could bear with more ease, had I not Written more against <hi>Popish</hi> Superstition, than any Presbyter in <hi>Scotland</hi> hath done. And for my part I wou'd be contented to lay down my Life to Morrow, upon Condition <hi>the Pope and Church of Rome</hi> would admit and confirm that <hi>Service-Book,</hi> which hath been here so eagerly charged against me: For were that done, it would give a greater blow to <hi>Popery;</hi> which is but the Corruption of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> than any hath yet been given: And that they know full well. And whereas they say, that <hi>for these things the Reformed Churches did separate from it, and came forth of Babel.</hi> That is true, that they did separate; and for these things: But not till for the maintaining of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to these things, they were <hi>Excommunicated,</hi> and Thrust out. Then indeed they separated, but not till they were forced by a double necessity; of <hi>Truth,</hi> from which they might not depart; and of that <hi>Punishment,</hi> which would not suffer them to enter. And yet the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> all and every of them, had need look well to themselves: For if they came out of <hi>Babel</hi> to run down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> they'll get little by the Bargain.

against me in convenient time. So upon this Accusation only, I was, upon <hi>Decemb.</hi> 18. committed to Mr. <hi>James Maxwell,</hi> the Officer <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Decemb.</hi> 18. 1640.</note> of the House, and so <hi>removed from his Majesty's Presence;</hi> which was the great aim against me. For they conceiv'd I wou'd speak my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, if I came near him: And they could not with any Colour of Justice take me from him, but by an Accusation of <hi>High Treason;</hi> of which I would not for all the World be as Guilty as some of them are, which Accused me. This was their desire for my Commitment.</p>
                     <p>Their next desire was, <hi>That I might be brought to Tryal, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my Censure according to the Laws.</hi> And this hath been, and yet is my desire, as well as theirs. For I long for nothing more than a <hi>Tryal;</hi> and I can fear no Censure that is according to Law; and am as free from the Breach of any Law, that can make me guilty of <hi>Treason,</hi> as I was when my Mother bare me into the World. And when I was thus far on upon my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, I had remained at Mr. <hi>Maxwell's,</hi> and in the <hi>Tower</hi> Eleven Months (so many it was when I writ this) But before I came to my Hearing I had been <hi>Thirteen Months</hi> in Prison, and neither brought to Tryal, no nor so much as a Particular Charge brought up against me, that I might prepare for an Answer, in so heavy a Business. And I am somewhat farther of my <hi>Accusers</hi> Mind; That to bring me to a just Tryal according to Law, <hi>would be good Service to God, Honour to the King, and the Parliament,</hi> who cannot but suffer in the Judgment of Moderate Men, for laying a Man of my Place and Calling so long in Prison, (a thing without all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent) and yet charging me with no particular. Nay, and I think, in a good Sense too, it would be <hi>a Terrour to the Wicked,</hi> to see an Innocent Man brought to such a Tryal. Yea, and yet <hi>a Comfort to all Good Men too,</hi> when they see, that an Innocent Man shall not be let lye, and languish to Death in Prison, (which may be my Case for ought I see) but that in some time they may hope for Tryal: Yea, and to them, <hi>the Scots in special.</hi> For this Bold, and most true Word I'll speak: The <hi>Scottish Nation</hi> in general, <hi>the City of Edinburgh</hi> in special, and very many particular Men of good Worth, and some Men of <hi>Honour,</hi> besides <hi>Clergy-men</hi> of all sorts, during the time I had Interest in Court, have been more beholding to me, than to any ten <hi>English</hi> Subjects of what rank and condition soever: And this <hi>his Majesty</hi> knows, and I dare say will Witness. And <hi>for their present Afflictions which they speak of,</hi> the Current of this Discourse will shew to the indifferent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what <hi>a Principal means I have been</hi> of them.

                     <p>NOW follows <hi>Adam Blair</hi> the second, with a <hi>Codicil,</hi> or a <hi>Corolla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to this Charge. And this though it concerns my Brethren, the Bishops, as much as me; yet because it charges upon the Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and was delivered in with the Charge against me, though <note place="margin">Decemb 15. 1640.</note> under another date, of <hi>December</hi> 15. I shall express what I think of that too. For I think the <hi>Scotch Commissioners</hi> took another day in upon advice, that they might have a fling at the whole Calling. And I cannot but think, it was upon design among them, when I consider, how eagerly <hi>the House of Commons</hi> hath followed <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> ever since. This <hi>Codicil</hi> to their <hi>last Will and Testament</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me begins thus:
<q>
                           <p>We do indeed confess, that the Prelates of <hi>England</hi> have been of very different humours, some of them of a more hot, and others of them Men of a moderate Temper; some of them more, and some less inclinable to <hi>Popery:</hi> yet what known Truth, and constant Experience, hath made undeniable, we must at this Opportunity <note n="*" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Profess,</hi> Rushw. &amp; Pryn.</note> express.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And so must we: For we as ingenuously confess, that the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Scotland</hi> have been of very different humours; some of them of a more hot, and others of them Men of a moderate Temper. And the more moderate for Temper, and the more able for Learning among them, have ever declared for the <hi>Episcopacy of England.</hi> But whereas they say, some of <hi>the Bishops of</hi> England, <hi>are more, and some less inclinable to Popery;</hi> that may seem to imply, that all of them are more or less inclinable to <hi>Popery:</hi> which I dare say is a loud un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth. Perhaps that which some of them call <hi>Popery,</hi> is <hi>Orthodox Christianity,</hi> and not one whit the worse for their miscalling it, though they much the worse for disbelieving it. But now you shall hear, what that <hi>known truth</hi> is, which <hi>constant experience</hi> (they say) <hi>hath made undeniable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <q>
                        <p>That from the first time of the Reformation of the Kirk of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> not only after the coming of King <hi>James</hi> of Happy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory into <hi>England,</hi> but before, the Prelates of <hi>England</hi> have been by all means uncessantly working the overthrow of our Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Government.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>A little change in the words answers this. For from the very first of the <hi>Reformation of the Church of England,</hi> as well before, as after, the coming in of King <hi>James</hi> of Happy Memory, the <hi>Presbyters of Scotland</hi> have been by all means uncessantly working the overthrow of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> our Discipline and Government: As appears most manifestly in <note n="†" place="margin">The <hi>Scottish</hi> 
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54614:81"/>
them: Or if it be truth, <hi>our Bishops</hi> had altogether as much reason, (if not more, the justice of the Cause considered) to work the overthrow of their <hi>Discipline,</hi> than they had of <hi>Episcopacy.</hi> But they tell us:
<q>
                           <p>It hath come to pass of late, that the Prelates of <hi>England</hi> having prevailed and brought Vs to Subjection in point of Government, and finding their long-waited-for Opportunity, and a rare Congrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of many Spirits and Powers ready to co-operate for their Ends, have made a strong Assault upon the whole External Worship and Doctrine of our Kirk.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Surely for <hi>their Doctrine,</hi> 'tis too large a Field to beat over at this time. Yet many Doctrines are on foot amongst them, which are fitter to be weighed, than swallowed, would they permit them to be brought to the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> and Balanced there. And for the <hi>whole External Worship</hi> which they speak of, I have heard it said, they have none at all; and out of doubt, 'tis very little they have, if any. And therefore if <hi>the Prelates of England had gotten an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and a Congruity of Spirits and Powers to co-operate,</hi> (which yet is not so) they had been much to blame, if they had not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued it, till they had brought both the one and the other to a better Condition than they stand in at present. And if they had such an <hi>Opportunity,</hi> they were much to blame that deserted it; And if they had not, these Men are unworthy for asserting it. But what End had <hi>the Prelates of England</hi> in this? Why sure—
<q>
                           <p>By this their doing they did not aim to make us conform to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> but to make <hi>Scotland</hi> first (whose weakness in resisting they had before experienced in Novations of Government, and of some Points of Worship) and <note n="*" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Thereafter,</hi> Pryn &amp; Rushw.</note> therefore England, conform to Rome, even in those matters wherein <hi>England</hi> had separated from <hi>Rome,</hi> ever since the time of <hi>Reformation.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>These Men out of doubt have, or take on them to have, a great insight into the Hearts and Souls of <hi>the Prelates of England.</hi> They know that <hi>we did not aim to make them conformable to</hi> England, <hi>but to make</hi> Scotland <hi>first, and then</hi> England, <hi>conformable to</hi> Rome. But I know the contrary; and will leave <hi>the Book it</hi> self to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Learned in all parts of <hi>Christendom,</hi> (for it is carefully Translated into <hi>Latin;</hi>) whether it teach, or practise Conformity with <hi>Rome,</hi> or not: which trial is far beyond their unlearned, and uncharitable <note n="†" place="margin">Skill.</note> Assertion. And if any other of my <hi>Brethren</hi> have had this aim, they should do well to name them. But they are so void of Charity; that they cannot forbear to say, that we aim to make them <hi>Conformable to</hi> Rome, <hi>even in those things wherein</hi> England <hi>had separated from</hi> Rome, <hi>ever since the Reformation.</hi> Which is so monstrous an untruth that I wonder how Impudence it self dare utter it; considering what <hi>the Bishops of England</hi> have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in defence of their <hi>Reformation</hi> against <hi>Rome,</hi> and how far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any thing which <hi>the Presbyters of Scotland</hi> have written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it.</p>

                        <pb n="139" facs="tcp:54614:81"/>
As for the Reason, which is given, why we began with <hi>Scotland,</hi> namely, <hi>because we had experience of their weakness in resisting Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Government, and of some Points of Worship:</hi> I know not what they mean by <hi>their weakness in resisting,</hi> unless it be, That they did not prevail against King <hi>James</hi> of Blessed Memory, (for resist they did to their power;) when he brought in <hi>Bishops,</hi> (which it seems they call <hi>Novations in Government,</hi>) and the <hi>Articles of Perth,</hi> which they stile <hi>Novations in some Points of Worship.</hi> And if this be that which they mean; there is no <hi>Novation</hi> in the one, or the other. And for their <hi>weakness in resisting,</hi> you may see what it is. For no sooner have they gotten the <hi>Opportunity,</hi> which they speak of in the beginning of this <hi>Codicil,</hi> but they cast out all their <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops;</hi> reversed all the <hi>Articles of Perth;</hi> all the <hi>Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which confirmed both; brought back all to the rude draught of <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Buchanan;</hi> saving that they have made it much worse, by admitting so many <hi>Lay-Elders</hi> with Votes in their <hi>General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,</hi> as may inable the Lay-men to make themselves what Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they please: A thing which the Church of <hi>Christ</hi> never knew in any part of it. Nor have they stayed here; but made use of the same <hi>Opportunity,</hi> to cry down the Bishops, and Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>in England:</hi> As you will see by that which comes next.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>An Evil therefore, which hath issued, not so much from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Disposition of the Prelates themselves, as from the innate Quality and Nature of their Office, and Prelatical Hierarchy, which did bring forth <hi>the Pope</hi> in Ancient times, and never <note n="†" place="margin">Ceased. <hi>Rush.</hi>
                           </note> ceaseth till it <note n="*" place="margin">Brought. <hi>Rushw.</hi>
                           </note> bring forth <hi>Popish</hi> Doctrine and Worship, where it is once rooted, and the Principles thereof fomented, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly followed.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>They tell us here, that this Conformity with <hi>Rome,</hi> is an <hi>Evil that issues not so much from the Personal Disposition of the Prelates them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as from the innate Quality and Nature of their Office.</hi> Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with <hi>Rome</hi> in any Error, or Superstition, is doubtless an <hi>Evil;</hi> but that <hi>it issues from the Nature of a Bishop's Office,</hi> cannot be. For that Office is to Preach <hi>Christ,</hi> and to govern the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> according to his Laws. If any Bishop break this, 'tis his Personal Error, and most <hi>unnatural to his Office;</hi> to which if he adhere, he can neither teach, nor practise, <hi>Superstition.</hi> Therefore certainly, what Error soever comes, is from his Person, not his Office. And 'tis great Ignorance to call this Evil an <hi>innate Quality of the Office;</hi> when the <hi>Office</hi> is a thing of <hi>Institution,</hi> not of <hi>Nature;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot possibly have any <hi>innate Quality</hi> in it.</p>
                     <p>But since they will needs have it thus; let us invert it a little, and see how it will fit them, against their <hi>King;</hi> more than it can fit <hi>the Bishops</hi> for the <hi>Pope.</hi> For if we should say (as perhaps we may too truly) that the dangerous Positions, which too many of the <hi>Presbyterian Faction</hi> publickly maintain, and in Print, proceed not so much from the <hi>Personal Disposition of the Presbyterians themselves, as from the innate Quality and Nature of their Presbyteries, and their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonarchical Party;</hi> I believe it would trouble them to shape a good
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54614:82"/>
Answer to it, unless they will admit of that which I before have given. But then, if they do this, they Charge themselves with fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood in that which they lay upon the <hi>Bishops Office.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Next they tell you, that <hi>this Prelatical Hierarchy did bring forth</hi> the Pope <hi>in Ancient times.</hi> But truly I think they are thus far deceived; The <hi>Hierarchy</hi> cannot be said to bring forth the chief parts of it self. Now <hi>the Patriarchs,</hi> (of which the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was one, if not Prime in Order,) were the Principal parts of the <hi>Hierarchy:</hi> Therefore the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> cannot well be said to bring them forth. But suppose it be so, that <hi>the Pope</hi> were brought forth by <hi>the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops;</hi> what fault is there in it? For <hi>the Pope</hi> was good, both <hi>Nomine &amp; Re,</hi> in name, and in being, as they were at first. For thirty of them together were <hi>Martyrs</hi> for <hi>Christ</hi>

                           <p>From the Antipathy and Inconsistence of the two Forms of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Government, which they conceived, and not without Cause, one Island, <note n="*" place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>Sure these Men have forgotten themselves. For they tell us immediatly before, that this Evil of bringing forth <hi>Popish</hi> Doctrine and Worship, proceeds from the very Office of a <hi>Bishop:</hi> And now they add, and from <hi>the Antipathy of these two Forms of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> Doth the <hi>Bishops Office</hi> produce <hi>Popery?</hi> And doth <hi>the Antipathy between the Presbytery and Episcopacy</hi> produce <hi>Popery</hi> too?

                        <hi>without Cause, one Island, joyned also under one Head and Monarch, was not able to bear:</hi> And that Evil was (as I conceive) the continual Jarrs and Oppositions, which would daily arise among <hi>His Majesties</hi> Subjects of both Kingdoms, concerning these different Forms of Government: And these would bring forth such Heart-burnings and Divisions among the People, that <hi>the King</hi> might never be secure at home, nor presume upon united Forces against a Foreign Enemy. And this is Evil enough to any Monarch of two divided King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; especially lying so near in one <hi>Island.</hi> Now, if the <hi>Bishops of England</hi> did conceive thus, and, as our Adversaries here confess, <hi>not without Cause;</hi> Then certainly by their own Confession, the <hi>Prelates of England</hi> had Reason to use all just endeavours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, and take away <hi>this Inconsistence,</hi> that the Form of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Government might be one, in <hi>one Island,</hi> and under one <hi>Monarch,</hi> that so Faction and Schism might cease; which else, when they get <hi>Opportunity,</hi> find a way to rent the Peace of Kingdoms, if not Kingdoms themselves. And this <hi>Island</hi> (God of his Mercy preserve it) is at this <note n="*" place="margin">Jan. 22. 1641.</note> time in great hazard to undergo the fata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of it in a great measure.</p>
                     <p>The next is a manifest untruth. For though <hi>there be</hi> (as is said) <hi>an Inconsistence between the Governments, which makes one Island under one King unable to bear both,</hi> in the different parts of the Island; or at least unsafe, while it bears them: Yet neither <hi>is Episcopacy in all the Parts and Powers of it, that which it was in time of</hi> Popery, <hi>and still is in the</hi> Roman <hi>Church.</hi> And this is most manifest to any Man, that will but look upon what Power <hi>the Prelates</hi> had before, and what they have since <hi>the Statute of the Submission of the Clergy</hi> in <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. time: Beside all those Statutes which have since been made in divers Particulars, to weaken their Power. <hi>Nor is the other Form of Government received, maintained, and Practised in all other</hi> Reformed <hi>Churches;</hi> unless these Men be so strait Laced, as not to admit the Churches of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> and indeed, all, or most of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> to be <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches. For in <hi>Sweden</hi> they retain both the Thing and the Name; and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of their Churches are, and are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Bishops.</hi> And among the other <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>Their request is, That not only the <hi>Bishops,</hi> whom they are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to call <hi>the Fire-brands</hi> (which indeed themselves and their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents are) but <hi>the Office,</hi> or <hi>Episcopacy</hi> it self, (which they call <hi>the Fire</hi>) may be provided against; <hi>That there may be no combustion after.</hi> This I as heartily wish, as any Man can; but see as little cause to hope for. For what hope can there be against <hi>after-Combustion,</hi> while <hi>the Fire,</hi> which they themselves have kindled, while they call other Men <hi>Incendiaries,</hi> burns on still, and is like to fasten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very <hi>Foundations,</hi> to the eating of them out?</p>
                     <p>Yet I desire here that the <hi>Justice,</hi> and the <hi>Indifferency</hi> of these Men may be well considered, and that in two things. The one <hi>in the Cause it self:</hi> For <hi>Episcopacy</hi> is settled by Law here; Nay it is many ways woven into the Laws and Customs of this Realm. And their great Complaint is, that their <hi>Presbyteries</hi> (which they say are established by their Law) were offer'd to be supprest: So they are angry that their <hi>Presbyteries</hi> should be touch'd against their Law; but <hi>Episcopacy</hi> must be destroyed, though it be never so much against our Law. The other piece of their <hi>Justice,</hi> is Personal to me. For here, at one and the same time, and in this one and the same Charge, they do by Consequences lay load on me, as if I had invaded their <hi>Laws:</hi> while they <hi>invade</hi> ours avowedly, and dare present this their <hi>Invasion,</hi> as well as that by Arms, in full and open <hi>Parliament of England,</hi> to have their Will in the <hi>one,</hi> and their Reward for the <hi>other.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now if these two Forms of Ecclesiastical Government, by <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy,</hi> and by <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> be inconsistent under one <hi>Monarch</hi> (as they themselves here confess) then I (were I at liberty) would humbly beseech <hi>the Lords</hi> to consider, First, whether these men have any shew, or colour of Justice in this their demand. Secondly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Form of Church-Government, which hath come down from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> continued to this Day, is established by the Laws, and usage of <hi>this Kingdom,</hi> ever since it was <hi>Christian,</hi> be not fitter for them to embrace and settle; than that Form which is but of Yesterday, and hath no acquaintance at all with our <hi>Laws,</hi> nor is agreeable with <hi>Monarchy?</hi> And lastly, when the <hi>Bishops</hi> are taken away, and a Parity (the Mother of confusion) made in the Church, and the Church-Lands Sacrilegiously made a Prey (which I have long feared is not the least Aim of too many) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then <hi>the Temporal Lords</hi> shall not follow after? And whether their Honour will not then soon appear too great, and their <hi>Means</hi> too full, till a <hi>Lex Agraria</hi> will pass upon them, and lay them level
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54614:83"/>
with them, whom some of them Favour too much? And when these things are considered, God Bless them, whom it most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, to lay it to Heart betimes, if Time be not slipped al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
                     <p>Here (having answer'd to all, which the <hi>Scots</hi> have laid in against me) I would have the <hi>Scotch Service</hi> inserted and Printed. The <hi>Book</hi> lyes by me, very exactly translated into <hi>Latin:</hi> And so I hope, this <hi>Tract</hi> shall be.</p>

This Censure being past upon these Men, though I did no more than is before mentioned, yet they, and that Faction continued all manner of Malice against me: And I had <hi>Libel</hi> upon <hi>Libel,</hi> scattered in the Streets, and pasted upon Posts.

                     <p>To return then: The Faction of the <hi>Brownists,</hi> and these three <hi>Saints,</hi> with their Adherents, (for they were now set at Liberty by the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> and brought into <hi>London</hi> in great Triumph) filled the Press almost Daily, with <hi>Ballads</hi> and <hi>Libels,</hi> full of all manner of Scurrility, and more Untruth, both against my Person, and my Calling. These were cried about <hi>London-streets,</hi> and brought (many of them) to <hi>Westminster,</hi> and given into divers <hi>Lords</hi> Hands, and into the Hands of the Gentlemen of the <hi>House of Commons:</hi> And yet no Order ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by <hi>either House</hi> to suppress the Printing of such known and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Lyes, as most of them contained: A thing which many sober Men found much fault withall, and which (I believe) hath hardly been seen, or suffered, in any Civil Common-wealth, <hi>Christian</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But when I saw the <hi>Houses of Parliament</hi> so regardless of their own Honour, to suffer these base and Barbarous Courses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst an Innocent Man, and as then not so much as Charged in general; I thought fit to arm my self with Patience, and endure that which I could not help. And by God's Blessing I did so; though it grieved me much more for my <hi>Calling,</hi> than for my <hi>Person.</hi> And this spreading of <hi>Libellous, Base Pamphlets</hi> continues <note n="†" place="margin">Jan. 26. 1641.</note> to this Day without controul; and how long it will continue to the Shame of the Nation, I cannot tell.</p>
                     <p>While I was thus committed to Mr. <hi>Maxwell,</hi> I found I was, by the course of the <hi>House,</hi> to pay in Fees for my Dyet and Custody, Twenty Nobles a day: This grew very heavy. For I was stayed there full ten weeks, before so much as any General Charge was brought up by the <hi>House of Commons</hi> against me; which in that time came to Four Hundred Sixty Six Pound Thirteen Shillings and Four Pence: And Mr. <hi>Maxwell</hi> had it all, without any Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <note place="margin">Dec. 21. 1640.</note> In the mean time, on <hi>Munday December</hi> 21. upon a Petition

Dom.</hi> 1627. I was then present, as Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells.</hi> After this, when the Storm was somewhat over, Sir <hi>Robert Howard</hi> conveyed her to his House at ....... <hi>in Shropshire,</hi> where she Lived avowedly with him some Years, and had by him ... Children. At last, they grew to that open boldness; that he brought her up to <hi>London,</hi> and lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her in <hi>Westminster.</hi> This was so near the Court, and in so open view; that <hi>the King</hi> and <hi>the Lords</hi> took notice of it, as a thing full of Impudence, that they should so publickly adventure to outface the Justice of the Realm, in so fowl a business. And one day, as I came of course to wait on <hi>his Majesty,</hi> he took me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, and told me of it, being then Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> and added, that it was a great Reproach to the Church and Nation; and that I neglected my Duty, in case I did not take order for it. I made answer, she was the Wife of <hi>a Peer of the Realm;</hi> and that without his leave I could not attach her; but that now I knew his <hi>Majesty's</hi> pleasure, I would do my best to have her taken, and brought to Penance, according to the Sentence against her. The next day I had the good hap to apprehend both Her and Sir <hi>Robert;</hi> and by Order of the <hi>High-Commission-Court,</hi> Imprisoned her in the <hi>Gate-House,</hi> and him in the <hi>Fleet.</hi>

And therefore in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the week following, Sir <hi>Robert</hi> dealt with some of his Friends, and among the rest, with one Sir ....... of <hi>Hampshire;</hi> who with Mony, corrupted the Turn-Key of the Prison (so they call him) and conveyed the Lady forth, and after that into <hi>France</hi> in Man's Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel

(as that Knight himself hath since made his boast.) This was told me the Morning after the escape: And you must think, the good Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of the Town was glad of it. In the mean time, I could not but know, though not perhaps prove as then, that Sir <hi>Robert Howard</hi> laboured and contrived this conveyance.

                        <p>
                           <hi>My Lords;</hi> This is a great and a heavy Charge; and I must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to live, if it can be made good against me: For it makes me against <hi>God,</hi> in point of <hi>Religion;</hi> Against the <hi>King,</hi> in point of <hi>Allegiance;</hi> And against the <hi>Publick,</hi> in point of <hi>Safety, under the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Protection of Law.</hi> And though the <hi>King</hi> be little, if at all mentioned; yet I am bold to Name him, because I have ever been of Opinion, that the <hi>King</hi> and his People are so joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in one Civil and Politick Body, as that it is not possible for any Man to be true to the <hi>King,</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> that shall be found Treacherous to the State Established by <hi>Law,</hi> and work to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the <hi>People:</hi> Though perhaps every one, that is so, is not able to see thorough all the Consequences, by which one depends upon the other. So my Charge, <hi>my Lords,</hi> is exceeding heavy in it self; though I as yet, do not altogether feel the weight of it. For 'tis yet (as <hi>your Lordships</hi> see) but in <hi>Generals;</hi> And <hi>Generals</hi> make a great noise, but no Proof: Whereas, 'tis Proof upon Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, that makes the weight of a Charge sit close upon any Man. Now, <hi>my Lords,</hi> 'tis an old and a true Rule, <hi>Errare contingit descendendo,</hi> Error doth most often happen, and best appear, when Men descend to Particulars: And with them when I shall be Charged, I hope my Innocence will furnish me with a sufficient Answer to any Error of mine, that shall be thought Criminal, or any way worthy the Cognizance of this High and Honourable <hi>Court.</hi> As for Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Frailties, as I cannot acquit my self of them, so I presume <hi>your Lordships</hi> will be favourable Judges of them: Since in the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action of so many businesses as passed my Hands, Men, far abler than ever I can be, have been subject to them, and, perhaps, to as many, and as great. But for <hi>Corruption</hi> in the least degree (I humbly praise God for it) I fear no <hi>Accuser,</hi> that will speak Truth. But (<hi>my Lords</hi>) that which goes nearest unto me among these <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> is, that I should be thought foul and false in the profession of my <hi>Religion:</hi> As if I should profess with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and have my Heart at <hi>Rome,</hi> and labour by all cunning ways to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54614:86"/>
bring <hi>Romish</hi> Superstition in upon the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> This (<hi>my Lords</hi>) I confess, troubles me exceedingly; and if I should forget my self, and fall into passion upon it; I should but be in that case which St. <hi>Jerome</hi> confessed he was in; when he knew not how to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, when Falshood in Religion was charged upon him. And yet that was nothing so high a Charge as this which is laid against me: Which is not only to be basely false my self; but withal, to  labour to spread the same Falshood over the whole <hi>Kingdom.</hi>

                     <p>And here I humbly besought their <hi>Lordships,</hi> that I might a little inlarge my self, and I did so.

                        <hi>Aristotle;</hi> and his Reasons are too good to be gone against. And ever since I had the honour to sit at the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Table,</hi> I kept my self as much to the <hi>Law</hi> as I could; and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Judgment of those great <hi>Lawyers</hi> which then sat at the <hi>Board.</hi> And upon all <hi>References</hi> which came from <hi>His Majesty,</hi> if I were one, I left those freely to <hi>the Law,</hi> who were not willing to have their business ended any other way.

And by God's Law, and the same Law of the Land, I humbly conceive, the Subjects, so met in <hi>Parliament</hi> ought to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their Prince, when there is just and necessary cause. And if an Absolute necessity do happen by Invasion, or otherwise, which gives no time for Counsel or Law; such a Necessity (but no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended one) is above all Law. And I have heard the greatest Lawyers in this Kingdom confess; that in times of such a Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, <hi>The King's Legal Prerogative</hi> is as great as this.</p>

And since here is of late such a noise made about the Subversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom,</hi> and Mens Lives called this way in question; 'tis very requisite, that these <hi>Fundamental Laws</hi> were known to all Men: That so they may see the danger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they run upon it: Whereas now, the <hi>Common Laws of England</hi> have no Text at all. In so much, that many, who would think themselves wronged, if they were not accounted good <hi>Lawyers,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in many points assure a Man what the <hi>Law</hi> is. And by this means, the <hi>Judges</hi> have liberty to retain more in <hi>Scrinio Pectoris,</hi> than is fitting; and which comes a little too near that <hi>Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> so much and so justly found fault with: Whereas there is no Kingdom (that I know) that hath a setled Government, but it hath also a <hi>Text,</hi> or a <hi>Corpus Juris</hi> of the Laws written, save <hi>England.</hi> So here shall be as great a punishment, as is any where, for the breach of the <hi>Laws,</hi> and no <hi>Text</hi> of them for a Man's direction. And under favour, I think it were a work worthy a <hi>Parliament,</hi> to Command some prime Lawyers, to draw up <hi>a Body of the Common Law,</hi> and then have it carefully Examined by all <hi>the Judges</hi> of the Realm, and thoroughly weighed by <hi>both Houses,</hi> and then have <hi>this Book</hi> Declared and Confirmed by <hi>an Act of Parliament,</hi> as contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom.</hi> And then let any Man go to Subvert them at his Peril.</p>

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:54614:88"/>
Date ..... Now, because there is no Particular known to me but this, belonging to this or any other <hi>Article;</hi> and because I know not what course the <hi>Parliament</hi> will hold with me; namely, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will produce Particulars, or proceed by <hi>Bill of Attainder,</hi> I will take opportunity here to unfold all that is true in this odious Accusation of <hi>Stone.</hi> And the Case is thus,</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Stone,</hi> knowing that these Fines with other were given by <hi>his Majesty</hi> towards the repair of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> in <hi>London;</hi> and that the Trust of that Business, with Power to abate any Fine, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to me, under <hi>the Broad Seal of England;</hi> became a very earnest Suiter to me in the behalf of these <hi>Chester-Men,</hi> fined at <hi>York.</hi> And he set divers of his Friends and mine upon me, for abatement of this Fine: And among others, his own Son-in-Law, Mr. <hi>William Wheat,</hi> Barrister at Law, who had been bred under me in St. <hi>John's Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wheat's</hi> Brother, <hi>Doctor Baylie,</hi> then Dean of <hi>Salisbury.</hi> In this Suit <hi>Stone</hi> pretended and protested too, that these Men ought him two or three Thousand Pound, (I well remember not whether) and that he should lose it all, if these Mens Fines were not abated. For they would hide their Heads, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appear again. During this Suit, he came twice, if not thrice, to my Steward, and told him, he had at present excellent Sack, and that he would send in two Pipes for me. My Steward at each time refused his motion, and acquainted me with it (as my Command ever was he should do in Cases of receiving any thing into my House.) I at every of these times commanded it should not be received. Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> then protested to my Steward, that he did not offer this as any Bribe or Gratuity for the business of the <hi>Chester-Men;</hi> but meerly as a Token of his Thankfulness for many and great Kindnesses done by me to himself, his Son-in-Law, and his Friend <hi>Doctor Baylie.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this, I gave absolute Command the Sack should not be received: When Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> saw this, he found a time to send in the Sack when my Steward was not in the House, and told my Under-Servants that my Steward was acquainted with it. The next time Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> came to the House, which (as far as I remember) was the very next day: My Steward told him, he would send back the Sack, and was about to do it (as he after assured me.) Then Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> was very earnest with him, that he would save his Credit, and not send the Wine back to his disgrace; renewing his former deep Protestations, that he had in this no relation at all to the <hi>Chester-Mens</hi> business. Upon this, my Steward being acquainted with him, and his fore-named Friends, trusted him, and let the Wine stay, contrary to my former Commands. After all this, this unworthy Man put the price of this Wine upon the <hi>Chester-Mens</hi> Account; as if for that Gift I had abated their Fine; and so gave them an occasion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of me to the <hi>Parliament.</hi> Whereas both the <hi>Chester-Men,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> himself, had before acknowledged, I had used them kindly in the Composition for their Fine, and wished they had been referred to me for the whole Cause. And for my whole carriage in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, I dare refer my self to the Testimony of Mr. <hi>Stone's</hi> own Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-Law, and Doctor <hi>Baylie,</hi> who were the chief Men whom Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> imployed to me.</p>

                        <pb n="154" facs="tcp:54614:89"/>
Besides, after all this cunning, it will appear by my Servants their Accounts, that the Wine was not brought into my House, in the cunning manner before mentioned, till divers days after I had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded with the <hi>Chester-Men</hi> for their Fine; so a Bribe for doing a business it could not be. And upon the whole matter, I am verily perswaded, considering <hi>Stone's</hi> Profession in Religion, (for he is a <hi>Brownist,</hi> or next Neighbour to him) that he did this of set purpose, to see if he could insnare me in this way. Lastly, I desire <hi>the Lords,</hi> and all Men, that have had any thing to do with me, to look upon me in the whole course of my Life; wherein they shall find me untainted with so much as the value of Six-pence in this base way. And it is not unknown to the World, that for many Years together I had opportunities enough to inrich my self by such a way, had I been minded to take that course: Whereas now, it is well known, my Estate is the meanest of any Arch-Bishop's of <hi>Canterbury</hi> that hath sate for many Years. And having carried it thus along for all my Life, I presume no Man can be so injurious to me, as to think I would now in mine Old Age (being Sixty Eight when this was Charged upon me) sell either my Conscience, or my Honour, for a Morsel of Bread, or a Cup of Wine.</p>
                     <p>And for the other part of this <hi>Article.</hi> I did never advise his <hi>Majesty,</hi> to sell Places of Judicature, or other Offices, or procure the Sale of them contrary to Law.</p>

                        <hi>His Majesty,</hi> some few Years since, assumed to himself, from the Right Honourable the Lord <hi>Coventry,</hi> the Lord Keeper that then was, and from my Lord <hi>Cottington,</hi> then Master of the Court of Wards, the disposing of all such <hi>Benefices,</hi> as came to the <hi>King's</hi> Gift by Title of Wardship, of what value soever they were. The Reason, which moved <hi>His Majesty</hi> to do this, was; The <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> and the <hi>Lord Cottington</hi> became humble Suitors to him, to end a Contention between them, about the giving of those <hi>Benefices,</hi> both for their own Quiet, and the Peace of other <hi>His Majesties</hi> Subjects. For the Course was, when any thing fell void in the Gift of a Ward, he of these two great <hi>Officers,</hi> which came first to know of the avoidance, gave the <hi>Living.</hi> This caused great, and oft-times undue, Practising among them which were Suitors for the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</hi> And many times the <hi>Broad-Seal,</hi> and the Seal of the <hi>Court of Wards,</hi> bore Date the same Day: And then the <hi>Bishop,</hi> which Clerk soever he Instituted, was sure to offend the other Lord. And these Lords too many times, by the earnest putting on of Friends, were not well pleased one with another in the Business. Upon this Suit of their own, <hi>His Majesty</hi> gave a Hearing to these Lords; and in Conclusion of it, took the Disposal of all such <hi>Benefices</hi> into his own Hands, and (for ought I know) with both their liking and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. In the disposing of these <hi>Benefices</hi> to such Men, as had served <hi>His Majesty</hi> at Sea, or otherwise, I was trusted by the <hi>King;</hi> and I served him in it faithfully; but proceeded no farther, nor otherwise, than he directed, and commanded me. But I never took the <hi>Nomination</hi> of any one to my self, or my own disposing. And the Truth of this, as <hi>His Majesty</hi> knows; so I am Confident, my <hi>Lord Cottington,</hi> who is yet living, will Witness.</p>

For the Nomination of Chaplains to <hi>the King,</hi> if I had done it, I think the work was as proper for the <hi>Arch-Bishop,</hi> as for any Man: Yet because by Ancient Custom it was conceived to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in a great part to <hi>the Lord Chamberlain</hi> (who was then the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Pembrook;</hi>) I never Named any to <hi>His Majesty,</hi> but I did fairly acquaint the <hi>Lord Chamberlain</hi> with it, and desired his favour. But in all my time I never was the means to prefer any Man to <hi>His Majesties</hi> Service, as a Chaplain, or to any Promotion, whom I knew to be <hi>Popishly</hi> affected, or any way Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in Doctrine or Manners.</p>

This I am sure of: I gave often, and express and strict Command to all and every of them, that they should License nothing that was contrary to the Doctrine and Discipline Established in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> or might Personally or otherwise give Offence or Distaste.

                     <p>And <hi>First,</hi> (in hope that they which have observed my Life in times past, will give me Credit in this time of my Affliction) I do here make my solemn <hi>Protestation,</hi> in the Presence of God, and this great Court, that I am Innocent of any thing, greater or less, that is charged in this <hi>Article,</hi> or any part of it. And I do here offer my Corporal Oath (Please it <hi>the Lords</hi> to give it me) in the strictest form that any Oath can be conceived; that I
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54614:92"/>
am wholly Innocent of this Charge. And let nothing be tendred against me but Truth, and I do challenge whatsoever is between Heaven and Hell to come in and Witness whatsoever they can against me in this Particular. For all that I have feared in all this Charge against me, is not Guilt, but Subornation of Perjury: Against which Innocency it self cannot be safe. And I have found the deadly Hatred of some Men against me to be such, as that, though I cannot suspect the <hi>House of Commons</hi> of such an Irreligious Baseness, yet I have great Cause to suspect some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Men, which I see make no Conscience of the Way, so they may compass their End.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly;</hi> Should I practice (be it with whom you will) to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinduce <hi>Romish Tyranny and Superstition</hi> over the true Religion <note place="margin">2.</note> established in <hi>England,</hi> I have taken a very wrong way to it. For I have hindred as many from going to the <hi>Roman</hi> Party, and have reduced as many from it; and some of great Quality, and some of great Learning and Judgment; as I believe any Divine in <hi>England</hi> hath done. And is this the way to bring in <hi>Romish Superstition,</hi> to reduce Men from it? Or is this the Reward from the State, which Men must look for, that have done these Services?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly; The Book,</hi> which I have Written against <hi>Mr. Fisher the Jesuit,</hi> must of Necessity either acquit me of this Calumny, or proclaim me a Villain to the World. And I hope, I have so <note place="margin">3.</note> lived, as that Men have not that Opinion of me; sure I am, I have not deserved it. And had this <hi>Book</hi> of mine been written accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Garb of the Time, fuller of Railing than Reason; a Learned <hi>Jesuit</hi> would have Laughed at it and me; and a Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Protestant</hi> might have thought I had Written it only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal my self and my Judgment in those Difficulties. But being Written in the way it is, I believe no <hi>Romanist</hi> will have much Cause to Joy at it, or to think me a Favourer of their Cause. And since I am thus put to it, I will say thus much more. This <hi>Book</hi> of mine is so Written (by God's great blessing upon me) as that whensoever the <hi>Church of England</hi> (as they are growing towards it apace) shall depart from the Grounds which I have therein laid, she shall never be able, before any Learned and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingaged <hi>Christian,</hi> to make good her Difference with, and her Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from, <hi>the Church of Rome.</hi> And let no Man think I speak Pride or Vanity in this. For the Outrages, which have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, force me to say it; and I am confident, future times will make it good; unless Profaneness break in, and over-run the whole Kingdom; which is not a little to be feared.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly;</hi> I must confess, I am in this Particular most unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. For many <hi>Recusants</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and many of that Party beyond the Seas, think I have done them and their Cause more <note place="margin">4.</note> Harm, than they which have seemed more fierce against them. And I doubt not, but I shall be able to prove, that I have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted beyond Sea, the greatest Enemy to them that ever sat in my Place. And shall I suffer on both sides? Shall I be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an Enemy by one part for opposing the <hi>Papist;</hi> and accused for a Traytor by the other for Favouring and Complying with
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54614:92"/>
them? Well; If I do suffer thus, 'tis but because Truth usually lies between two Extreams, and is beaten by both: (As the poor <hi>Church of England</hi> is, at this day, by the <hi>Papist</hi> and the <hi>Separatist.</hi>) But in this, and all things else, in despight of all Malice, Truth shall be either my Protection from Suffering, or my Comfort while I suffer: And by God's gracious assistance I shall never depart from it, but continue at the <hi>Apostle's</hi> Ward, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>Nihil possum contra veritatem,</hi> I can do <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8.</note> nothing against the Truth; and for it, I hope God will enable me patiently to suffer any thing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly;</hi> If I had practised with the <hi>Pope,</hi> or his <hi>Agents,</hi> for the <note place="margin">5.</note> alteration of Religion in <hi>England;</hi> surely I must have used many great and dextrous Instruments to compass my end. And in a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of so great Consequence, Difficulty and Danger, to all that should have a Hand, nay but a Finger in it, no Man would venture to meddle without good pay. And 'tis well known, that I have filled no Purse, nor laid up any store, to set ill Instruments on work, upon that or any other unworthy design.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly;</hi> I am a Man in Years, great Years for a Man so loaded <note place="margin">6.</note> with business as I have been all my Life: And it cannot be long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I must go to give God Almighty an account of all my Actions. And whatsoever the Malignity of the Time may put upon me; yet they which know me and my ways, will easily believe, that I have not so little Conscience, or care of my Soul, as to double with God to my very Death. Nay, could I have doubled thus, I could easily have seen a way through all this difficulty; and how to have been as gracious with the People, as any, even the worst, of my <hi>Predecessours.</hi> But I have ever held, that the lowest depth of Baseness, to frame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to serve turns; and to be carried about with every wind of vain Doctrine, to serve and please other Mens Fancies, and not a Man's own either Understanding or Conscience.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seventhly;</hi> I think the greatest Enemies I have, are of Opinion, <note place="margin">7.</note> that if I would have turned to the <hi>Roman</hi> Party, especially if I would have been such an active Instrument for them, as this Article would make me, I might have been welcome to them, and should have been rewarded by them; at least, that I should have been made able to live in <hi>Credit,</hi> if not in <hi>Honour.</hi> And this being granted; I would fain know, what could stay me here, save only my Conscience in and to the Truth. Surely, not any care of Wife and Children, for I have them not: And as this Storm drives upon me, I most humbly and heartily bless God for it, that I have not any of these Clogs to hang about me. Not the Greatness of my Place: For if in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Tumble, any thing be put either upon it or me, that a knowing Conscience ought to check at, the World shall soon see, how little I value <hi>Canterbury</hi> in regard of <hi>Conscience.</hi> Not the Honour of my place neither: For if I stood upon that, I cannot but see how Malice hath laid that in the Dust, or lower if it may be. And can any Man think then, that I would indure so much hatred, and so many base <hi>Libels,</hi> as have filled the Streets against me, and such bitter revilings of me in Print, as the Gall of some Pens have cast upon me, when I might go live elsewhere with Content and Reputation? Sure no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Conscience could stay me here in such a Condition. Not
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54614:93"/>
the Wealth to be gotten in my place: For the <hi>Arch-Bishoprick of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> is far short of the value put upon it, (according as I have given a faithful Account to <hi>his Majesty.</hi>) And if it were of never so great a value, I have made it manifest to the World, that Wealth is not my aim. For whatsoever benefit hath accrewed to me, over and above my necessary and decent Expences, I have refunded back upon the Poor, or the Publick, or the Church from whence I had it; as in better times <hi>Church-Men</hi> were wont to do. So there could be no external motive to work upon me, to make me stay here, if my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science went along with <hi>Rome.</hi> And my Conscience being not that way set, (as most certainly it is not) no Man can so much as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly think, I should with hazard of my Life and Honour, and all things, practise the Change of <hi>Religion,</hi> and that against my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>

But this I found, that they did not use their Priviledges with that Gratitude and Fairness to <hi>his Majesty,</hi> the <hi>State,</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as they ought to have done. And hereupon I acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>his Majesty</hi> and the <hi>Lords,</hi> in full and open <hi>Council,</hi> with what I conceived concerning that business. As Namely,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That their living as they did, and standing so strictly to their own Discipline, wrought upon the Party in <hi>England,</hi> which were addicted to them, and made them more averse, than otherwise they would have been, to the present Government of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That by this means they lived in <hi>England,</hi> as if they were a kind of God's <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> to the great Dishonour of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> to which at first they fled for Shelter against Persecution. And in that time of their Danger, the <hi>Church of England</hi> was in their Esteem not only a true but a glorious Church. But by this Favour, which that Church received, it grew up and incroached upon us, till it became a Church within a Church, and a kind of State within a State. And this I ever held dangerous, how small beginning soever it had: And that upon two main Reasons. The one, because I find the Wisdom of God against it. For he says plainly to his prime People, <hi>One Law,</hi> (and especially for Divine Worship) <hi>shall be to him that is home-born, and to the Stranger that Sojourns among you,</hi> Exod. 12. And the other, because <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 49.</note> I find the Wisdom of this <hi>State</hi> against it. For this <hi>Parliament,</hi> in their <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> give the self-same Reason against the <hi>Papists,</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Which.</note> but must hold good against all <hi>Sects</hi> that labour to make strong and inlarge themselves. The Words are these, <note n="†" place="margin">Remonst. <hi>Die Mercurii,</hi> 15. <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1641. <hi>p.</hi> 20.</note> 
                        <hi>Another State moulded within this State, independent in Government, contrary in Interest and Affection, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And the Words are as true of the one Faction, as the other; and I ever pressed the Argument alike against both; as I can prove by good Witness, if need be. And I pray God, this <hi>Faction,</hi> too little fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and too much nourished among us, have not now found the Opportunity waited for.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That they live here, and enjoy all freedom, and yet for the most part scorn so much as to learn the Language, or to converse with any, more than for advantage of Bargaining. And will take no <hi>Englishman</hi> to be their Apprentice, nor teach them any of their <hi>Manufactures:</hi> which I did then, and do still, think most unreasonable.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That for <hi>Religion,</hi> if after so many descents of their Children born in the Land, and so Native Subjects, these Children of theirs
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:54614:95"/>

And this concerning their Children, was all that was desired by me: As appears by <note n="*" place="margin">26. <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1635.</note> the <hi>Act,</hi> which my <hi>Vicar Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> made concerning those Churches at <hi>Canterbury, Sandwitch,</hi> and <hi>Maidstone,</hi> in my <hi>Diocess,</hi> and <note n="†" place="margin">11. <hi>Octob.</hi> 1635.</note> the Publication of <hi>this Act</hi> in their Congregations, by their own Ministers, in this Form following.</p>

And to that end, <hi>his Majesty</hi> is content to permit the Natives of the first degree, to continue Members of our Congregations, as before. But the Natives in this Church, after the first descent, are injoyned to obey my Lord Arch-Bishop his <hi>Injunction;</hi> which is to conform themselves to the <hi>English</hi> Discipline and Liturgy, every one in his Parish; without inhibiting them notwithstanding, from resorting sometimes to our Assemblies.

                     <p>And since this time I have not only seen, but gotten, the very Original Letter of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of Happy Memory, written to the <hi>Lord Treasurer Pawlet,</hi> specifying what Order she would should be taken with, and for, these Churches. The Letter is Signed with <hi>her Majesty's</hi> own Hand and Signet; and gives them not half so much Liberty, I do not say as they take, but as I have been ever most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to give them. For the <hi>Queen</hi> in these Letters allows them nothing contrary to her Laws; and therefore nothing but <hi>our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy</hi> in their own Language, not another Form of Divine Service and Discipline, much different from it.

And
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54614:96"/>
I think it cannot easily be forgotten that I gave this Counsel: For my Lord the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> opposed me openly at the <hi>Table</hi> then, and said my Grounds would deceive me. And my Lord the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> came to me, so soon as we were risen from Counsel, and was pleased to say to me, that I had done my self and my Calling a great deal of Right, and <hi>the King</hi> my Master the best Service, that ever I did him in my Life.

                        <hi>Male,</hi> of his Majesty's Bed-chamber, when he heard what I had done, came and gave me a great deal of Thanks in the Name of that <hi>Nation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor did I labour to introduce into the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Innovations in Religion or Government: Neither do all, or the most part, or indeed any of those pretended <hi>Innovations</hi> tend to <hi>Popery</hi> or Superstition, as hath before been sufficiently proved. Neither did I, upon their refusal to submit to these, Advise his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty to Subdue them by force of Arms, but the Counsels which I gave were open, either at the <hi>Committee,</hi> or the <hi>Council-Table.</hi> Neither did I by my own Power and Authority, contrary to <hi>Law,</hi> procure any of <hi>his Majesty's</hi> Subjects, or inforce the Clergy of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to contribute to the maintenance of that War: But <hi>the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidies</hi> which were given <hi>to his Majesty</hi> at that time, were given freely, and in open <hi>Convocation,</hi> and without any practice of my self, or any other; as appears by what I have formerly laid down.</p>
                     <p>But because so much noise hath been made against me both in the <hi>Scottish Charge</hi> before answered, and in this <hi>Article</hi> about <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish</hi> Innovations in that <hi>Service-Book,</hi> and that I laboured the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing both of it and them: I think it fit, if not necessary, to set down briefly the Story what was done, and what I did, and by what Command in all that Business. And it follows.</p>
                     <p>Dr. <hi>John Maxwel,</hi> the late Bishop of <hi>Ross,</hi> came to me from <hi>his Majesty,</hi> it was during the time of a great and dangerous Fever, under which I then laboured: It was in the Year 1629. in <hi>August</hi> or <hi>September,</hi> which come that time is <note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>Feb.</hi> 8. 1641.</note> Thirteen Years since. The Cause of his coming was to speak with me about a <hi>Liturgy</hi> for <hi>Scotland.</hi> At his coming I was so extream Ill, that I saw him not. And had Death (which I then expected daily, as did my Friends and Physicians also) seized on me, I had not seen this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy time. After this, when I was able to sit up, he came to me again, and told me it was <hi>his Majesty's</hi> Pleasure, that I should receive Instructions from some Bishops of <hi>Scotland</hi> concerning a <hi>Liturgy</hi> for that Church; and that he was imployed from my Lord the Arch-Bishop of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> and other Prelates there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. I told him I was clear of Opinion, that if <hi>his Majesty</hi> would have a <hi>Liturgy</hi> setled there, it were best to take the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Liturgy</hi> without any variation, that so the same <hi>Service-Book</hi> might be established in all <hi>his Majesty's</hi> Dominions: Which I did then, and do still think would have been a great Happiness to this <hi>State,</hi> and a great Honour and Safety to Religion. To this he replyed, that he was of a contrary Opinion, and that not he only, but the <hi>Bishops</hi> of that Kingdom thought their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54614:96"/>
would be much better satisfied, it a <hi>Liturgy</hi> were framed by their own <hi>Clergy,</hi> than to have the <hi>English Liturgy</hi> put upon them; yet he added, that it might be according to the Form of our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Service-Book.</hi> I answered to this, that if this were the Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of my Brethren the Bishops of <hi>Scotland,</hi> I would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain so much as Thoughts about it, till I might by God's Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing have Health and Opportunity to wait upon <hi>his Majesty,</hi> and receive his farther directions from himself.</p>
                     <p>When I was able to go abroad, I came to <hi>his Majesty,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented all that had passed. <hi>His Majesty</hi> avowed the sending of <hi>Dr. Maxwell</hi> to me, and the Message sent by him. But then he inclined to my Opinion, to have the <hi>English Service</hi> without any alteration to be established there: And in this Condition I held that Business, for two if not three Years at least. Afterwards, the <hi>Scottish</hi> Bishops still pressing <hi>his Majesty</hi> that a <hi>Liturgy</hi> Framed by themselves, and in some few things different from ours, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish better with their Countrymen. They at last prevailed with <hi>his Majesty,</hi> to have it so, and carried it against me, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all I could say or do to the contrary. Then <hi>his Majesty</hi> Commanded me to give the Bishops of <hi>Scotland</hi> my best Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in this Way and Work. I delayed as much as I could with my Obedience; and when nothing would serve, but it must go on; I confess I was then very serious, and gave them the best help I could. But wheresoever I had any doubt, I did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquaint <hi>his Majesty</hi> with it, but Writ down most of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendments or Alterations in <hi>his Majesty's</hi> Presence. And I do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe, there is no one thing in <hi>that Book,</hi> which may not stand with the Conscience of a right Good <hi>Protestant.</hi> Sure I am <hi>his Majesty</hi> approved them all; and I have his Warrant under his Royal Hand for all that I did about <hi>that Book.</hi> And to the end the <hi>Book</hi> may be extant, and come to the view of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> World, and their Judgment of it be known; I have caused it to be exactly Translated into <hi>Latin,</hi> and, if right be done, it shall be Printed with this <hi>History.</hi> This was that which I did concerning the Matter and Substance of this <hi>Service-Book.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the way of Introducing it, I ever advised the <hi>Bishops,</hi> both in <hi>his Majesty's</hi> Presence, and at other times, both by Word and by Writing, that they would look carefully to it, and be sure to do nothing about it but what should be agreeable to the <hi>Laws of that Kingdom:</hi> And that they should at all times be sure to take the Advice of the <hi>Lords of his Majesty's Council</hi> in that Kingdom, and govern themselves and their Proceedings accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. Which Course if they have not followed, that can no way reflect upon me, who have both in this, and all things else, been as careful of <hi>their Laws</hi> as any Man who is a Stranger to them could be. And in a <hi>Letter</hi> of mine after my last coming out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> thus I wrote to the late Reverend Arch-Bishop of <hi>S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews, Septemb.</hi> 30. 1633. concerning the <hi>Liturgy:</hi> That whether that of <hi>England,</hi> or another were resolved on, yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>And here I take leave to acquaint the <hi>Reader,</hi> That this was no new Conceit of <hi>His Majesty,</hi> to have a <hi>Liturgy</hi> framed, and <hi>Canons</hi> made for the Church of <hi>Scotland:</hi> For he followed his Royal Father King <hi>James</hi> his Example and Care therein, who took Order for both at <hi>the</hi>

                        <hi>Pacification</hi> made the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Year. The <hi>Article</hi> says <hi>I did Censure it as Dishonourable; and Advise for a new War:</hi> But I did neither. That which I spake, was openly at <hi>the Council-Table,</hi> and in <hi>His Majesty's</hi> presence: And it was this. There arose a debate at the <hi>Table,</hi> about these Affairs, and <hi>the Pacification;</hi> and I said that I did often wish from my Heart that <hi>His Majesty</hi> had kept the Army which he had at <hi>Barwick</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but Eight or Ten Days longer: And that I did not doubt, but that if he had so done, he might have had more Honourable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of his <hi>Scottish</hi> Subjects. This I said, and more or otherwise I said not; and whosoever shall relate them otherwise, forgets Truth. Now to say, that <hi>His Majesty</hi> might have had more Honourable Conditions, doth not infer, that the <hi>Pacification</hi> then made was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Dishonourable Conditions; but only upon less Honourable than it might have been. And I had great Reason to observe my own words, and remember them; because I saw some Lords at <hi>the Table</hi> touched with them, perhaps in their own Particulars.</p>
                     <p>Nor was I alone in this Judgment: For my Lord the Earl of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> though he then said nothing at the <hi>Council-Table;</hi> yet at his first return from <hi>Barwick,</hi> his Lordship did me the Honour to come and see me at <hi>Lambeth:</hi> And in the Gallery there, while we were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing of the Affairs in the <hi>North;</hi> of himself he used these words to me: <hi>That His Majesty did too suddenly dissolve his Army there; indeed so suddenly, that every body wondered at it: And that for his part he was so sorry, especially for the dismissing of all the Horse;</hi> (which he said were as good as any were in Christendom:) And farther, that <hi>he offer'd His Majesty to keep one Thousand of them for a Year at his own and his Friends Charge, till the King might see all things well setled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in Scotland.</hi> By which it is apparent, that in his Lordships Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment things might have been better, had not <hi>that Army been</hi> so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly dissolved: And I hope it was no Sin in me to wish the best success, and the most Honour <hi>to the King's</hi> Affairs.</p>
                     <p>Now that which moved me to say thus at the <hi>Council-Table,</hi> was this. The last <hi>Article</hi> in <hi>the Pacification</hi> was, <hi>To restore to every one of His Majesties Subjects their Liberties, Lands, Houses, Goods and Means whatsoever, taken and detained from them by whatsoever means since the aforesaid time:</hi> But within two Days (or three at the most) after the <hi>Pacification</hi> agreed upon, and concluded, <hi>the Lord Lindsay</hi> made an open and publick <hi>Protestation</hi> either in the Camp at <hi>Dunns,</hi> or at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        <hi>was</hi> included in the <hi>Pacification:</hi> Which yet expresses every one of <hi>His Majesties</hi> Subjects. And this, I did then conceive,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54614:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(and do still) was a very bold audacious Act of that Lord, very injurious to the Poor Clergy, and not so Honourable for <hi>the King.</hi> And this made me say, and I say it still, <hi>His Majesty</hi> might have had more Honourable Conditions, and his <hi>Pacification</hi> better kept, had he continued his <hi>Army</hi> but Eight or Ten Days longer: For in all probability the <hi>Scots</hi> could not so long have continued their <hi>Army</hi> together. And I did farther conceive, that by this Act of the <hi>Lord Lindsay</hi> in protesting, and by the <hi>Scots</hi> making his Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion good against the Clergy, there was a direct and manifest Breach of <hi>the Pacification</hi> on their behalf. And then, though I saw no Reason why <hi>the King</hi> should be bound to keep that mutual <hi>Pacification,</hi> which they had broken; (for a Knot must be fast at both ends, or loose at both:) Yet remembring my Calling, I did not Incense <hi>His Majesty</hi> against his Subjects in <hi>Scotland;</hi> nor did hereupon advise the undertaking of an <hi>Offensive War</hi> against them; nor ever give other Counsel in this Particular, than what I openly gave before <hi>the Lords,</hi> either in the <hi>Committee,</hi> or at the <hi>Board:</hi> And there my Concurring in Opinion with all the rest of <hi>the Lords,</hi> was (I hope) no other, nor no greater fault, than in them, though I be thus singled out.</p>
                     <p>And for the <hi>Pacification,</hi> I shall say thus much more: Though I could with all my Heart have wished it more Honourable for <hi>the King,</hi> and more express and safe for my Brethren of the Clergy; yet all things Considered, which were put unto me, I did approve it. For before the <hi>Pacification</hi> was fully agreed upon, <hi>His Majesty</hi> did me the Honour to write unto me all with his own Hand: In this Letter He Commanded me, all delay set apart, to send him my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment plainly and freely what I thought of the <hi>Pacification;</hi> which was then almost ready for conclusion. I in all Humility approved of the <hi>Pacification,</hi> as it was then put to me; and sent my Answer presently back, and my Reasons why I approved it: Little think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then, but that my Poor Brethren the Bishops of <hi>Scotland</hi> should have had all restored unto them, according to the <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification,</hi> before recited; or at least for so long, till they had defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves and their Calling, and their Cause, in a free <hi>General Assembly,</hi> and as free a Parliament. Now this was ever <note n="*" place="margin">Assured.</note> assumed to me should be done; and to procure this, was all which <hi>the Bishops</hi> seemed to desire of me. And for the Truth of this I appeal to <hi>His Majesty,</hi> to whom I writ it: And to my <hi>Lord Marquess Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> to whom <hi>the King</hi> shewed my <hi>Letter,</hi> (As my <hi>Lord Marquess</hi> himself told me at his return.) And to Dr. <hi>Juxon</hi> Lord Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> then Lord High Treasurer of <hi>England;</hi> to whom I shewed my <hi>Letter</hi> before I sent it away. And this is all I did concerning the <hi>Pacification.</hi>

                     <p>It is true, I have been much and very often grieved, to see the great distractions which have happened of later Years, both in King <hi>James</hi> his time, and since, about the Breaches which have been in <hi>Parliaments.</hi> And I have as heartily wished, and to my Power endeavoured, that all <hi>Parliaments</hi> which have been call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, might come to their Happy Issue, and end in the Contentment of <hi>the King</hi> and his People. And I have ever been of Opinion, and I shall Live and Dye in it; That there can be no true and setled Happiness in this or any other Kingdom, but by a fair and <hi>Legal,</hi> as well as <hi>Natural</hi> Agreement between <hi>the King</hi> and his People; and that, according to the Course of <hi>England,</hi> this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement is in a great proportion founded upon <hi>Parliaments.</hi> Now Parliaments (as I humbly conceive) can never better preserve their own Rights, than by a free and honourable way, to keep up the Greatness and Power of their <hi>King;</hi> that so he may be the better able, against all Forreign Practices, to keep up the Honour as well as the Safety of the Nation; both which usually stand or fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And if any particular Mens Miscarriages have distemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and caused or occasioned a Breach; I have (upon the Grounds before laid) been as sorry as any Man for it, but never contributed any thing to it. And I hope it is not Criminal to think, that <hi>Parliaments</hi> may sometimes, in some things, by <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>information</hi> or otherwise, be mistaken, as well as other <hi>Courts.</hi>

                     <p>This in conclusion I clearly think, <hi>Parliaments</hi> are the best pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers of the Ancient Laws and Rights of this Kingdom.

By this means Mr. <hi>Maxwell</hi> (whose Office tied him to attendance upon that Solemnity) could not possibly go with me to <hi>the Tower</hi> at Evening, as I desired. Therefore Noon, when the Citizens were at Dinner, was chosen as the next fittest time for Privateness.

                     <p>ON <hi>Munday, Mar.</hi> 22. the Earl of <hi>Strafford's</hi> Tryal began in <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mar.</hi> 22. 1641.</note> 
                        <hi>Westminster-Hall:</hi> And it continued with some few Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions till the end of <hi>April.</hi> The <hi>Earl</hi> got all the time a great deal of Reputation by his Patient, yet Stout and clear Answers, and changed many Understanding Mens Minds concerning him: Insomuch, that the great Lawyers of his <hi>Council</hi> affirmed there open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That there was no <hi>Treason</hi> appearing to them by any Law. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this the <hi>House of Commons</hi> (who were all the while present in a Body) left the <hi>Hall,</hi> and instead of leaving the whole Cause to the Judgment of <hi>the Lords</hi> in the ordinary Way of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> betook themselves to their Legislative Power, and so passed a <hi>Bill of Attainder</hi> against him; and having none, made a Law to take away his Life. This <hi>Bill</hi> was denyed by two or three and fifty, as able Men as any in the <hi>House of Commons.</hi> But the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> grew so hot, that all their Names were Pasted up at the <hi>Exchange</hi> under the Title of <hi>Straffordians,</hi> thereby to increase the Hatred of the People, both against him and them; and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels multiplyed</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Bill</hi> went on with great haste and earnestness; which <hi>the King</hi> observing, and loth to lose so great and good a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, <hi>his Majesty</hi> came into the <hi>House of Lords,</hi> and there upon <hi>Saturday Maii</hi> 1. Declared unto both <hi>Houses</hi> how carefully he had <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Maij</hi> 1. 1641.</note> heard and observed all the Charge against the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">See the King's Speech apud <hi>Rush.</hi> p. <hi>239.</hi>
                        </note> (for he was present at every Days Hearing) and found that his Fault, whatever it were, could not amount to <hi>Treason:</hi> And ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That if they meant to proceed by <hi>Bill,</hi> it must pass by him, and that he could not in his Conscience find him guilty, nor would ever wrong his Honour or his Conscience so far, as to pass such a <hi>Bill;</hi> or to that Effect. But advised them to proceed by way of <hi>Misdemeanour,</hi> and he would concur with them in any Sentence. This displeased mightily, and I verily think it hasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Earl's</hi> Death. And indeed to what end should <hi>the King</hi> come voluntarily to say this, and there, unless he would have abode by it, whatever came? And it had been far more <hi>Regal</hi> to reject <hi>the Bill</hi> when it had been brought to him, (his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence standing so as <hi>his Majesty</hi> openly professed it did) than to make this Honourable Preface, and let the <hi>Bill</hi> pass after.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>House of Commons,</hi> and some <hi>Lords</hi> too, it seems, eagerly bent against the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> seeing by this <hi>the King's</hi> bent, grew more sharp, and pursued the <hi>Bill</hi> the more violently: In so much that within two or three Days after, some Citizens of <hi>London</hi> and Prentices came down in Multitudes to <hi>the Parliament,</hi> called there for Justice, and pretended all Trade was stopp'd, till Justice was done upon the Earl of <hi>Strafford.</hi> Who brought on
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54614:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the People to this way, I would not tell you if I did certainly know; but wise Men see that plain enough without telling. These People press upon <hi>the Lords</hi> in a way unknown in the <hi>English</hi> Government, yea or in any setled Government in <hi>Christendom.</hi> In conclusion, they are taught to threaten <hi>the King</hi> and his Court in a strange Manner, if they may not have speedy Justice. The <hi>Bill</hi> comes up to <hi>the Lords,</hi> when <hi>the House</hi> was none of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest, (but what made so many absent I know not) and there it past. And upon <hi>Sunday, May</hi> 9. <hi>the King</hi> was so laid at, and so <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Maij</hi> 9. 1641.</note> frighted with these Bugbears, that if Justice were not done, and <hi>the Bill</hi> Passed for the Earl of <hi>Strafford's</hi> Execution, the Multitude would come the Next Day, and pull down <hi>White-Hall,</hi> (and God knows what might become of the King himself) that these fears prevailing, <hi>his Majesty</hi> gave way, and <hi>the Bill</hi> passed; and that Night late, Sir <hi>Dudly Carlton,</hi> one of the Clerks of the <hi>Council,</hi> was sent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> to give <hi>the Earl</hi> warning that he must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to Dye the <hi>Wednesday</hi> Morning following.</p>
                     <p>The Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> received the Message of Death with great Courage, yet Sweetness; (as Sir <hi>Dudly</hi> himself after told me:) On <hi>Munday</hi> Morning the <hi>Earl</hi> sent for the Lord Primate of <hi>Armagh</hi> to come to him. He came; and the same Day visited me, and gave me very high Testimony of the <hi>Earl's</hi> Sufficiency and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution: And among the rest this; That he never knew any Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in all his Life, that so well and fully understood Matters of <hi>Divinity,</hi> as the <hi>Earl</hi> did; and that his Resolutions were as firm and as good.</p>
                     <p>In this <hi>Interim</hi> before the Day of his Death, he made by his Friends two Suits to <hi>his Majesty:</hi> The one, that he might Dye privately within the <hi>Tower;</hi> the other, That his Death might be Respited till the <hi>Saturday,</hi> that he might have a little more time to settle his Estate. <hi>His Majesty</hi> sent these Requests to <hi>the Houses.</hi> Answer was returned to the first, That the People would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied, nor believe he was Dead, unless they saw him Dye pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly. And to the second, That time enough was given already; and that if any farther delay were used, the People would think Justice should not be done at all, and resort thither again in Multitudes, to the hazzard of Publick Peace.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Earl</hi> made these two Suits; and in the mean time one Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer was made to him. It was this, That if he would employ his Power and Credit with <hi>the King,</hi> for the taking of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> out of the <hi>Church,</hi> he should yet have his Life. His Christian Answer was very <hi>Heroical;</hi> Namely, That <hi>he would not buy his Life at so dear a rate.</hi> The Man that sent him this Message was his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law, Mr. <hi>Denzill Hollis,</hi> one of the great Leading Men in the <hi>House of Commons:</hi> And my Lord Primate of <hi>Armagh,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed this from the Earl of <hi>Strafford's</hi> own Mouth. And as he was of too Generous a Spirit to lye basely, so being in preparing of himself to leave the World, it cannot be thought he would with a Dying-Mouth bely his Brother.</p>
                     <p>These Answers being returned, <hi>the Earl</hi> prepared himself: And
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54614:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>

                        </note> in their Judgment, who were Men of Worth, and some upon, some near the Scaffold, and saw him Dye, he made a Patient, and Pious, and Couragious end; insomuch, that some doubted whether his Death had more of the <hi>Roman</hi> or the <hi>Christian</hi> in it, it was so full of both. And notwithstanding this hard Fate, which fell upon him, he is dead with more Honour, than any of them will gain who hunted after his Life. Thus ended the Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, the Stoutest, and every way the Ablest Subject, that this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath bred these many Years. The only Imperfections which he had, that were known to me, were his want of <hi>Bodily Health,</hi> and a Carelesness (or rather Roughness) not to oblige any: And his Mishaps in this last Action were, that he groan'd under the Publick Envy of the <hi>Nobles,</hi> served a Mild and a Gracious Prince, who knew not how to be, or be made great; and trusted false, perfidious and cowardly Men in the <hi>Northern</hi> Imployment, though he had many Doubts put to him about it. This Day was after call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by divers, <hi>Homicidium Comitis Straffordiae,</hi> the Day of the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Strafford:</hi> Because when Malice it self could find no Law to put him to Death, they made a Law of purpose for it. God forgive all, and be Merciful.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Earl</hi> being thus laid low, and his great Services done in <hi>Ireland</hi> made part of his Accusation, I cannot but observe two things: The one, That upon <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning before, <hi>Francis</hi> Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi> (having about a Month before lost his second Son, in whom he most Joyed) Dyed; the Small Pox striking up into his Brain. This Lord was one of the Main Plotters of <hi>Strafford's</hi> Death: And I know where he, with other Lords, before the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> Sat down, resolved to have his Blood. But God would not let him Live to take Joy therein, but cut him off in the Morning, whereas the <hi>Bill</hi> for the Earl of <hi>Strafford's</hi> Death was not Signed till Night. The other is, That at this time <hi>the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> tender'd two, and but two <hi>Bills</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> to Sign. This to cut off <hi>Strafford's Head</hi> was one, and the other was, that <hi>this Parliament</hi> should neither be Dissolved, nor Adjourned, but by the consent of both <hi>Houses;</hi> in which, what he cut off from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, Time will better shew than I can. God Bless the King and his Royal Issue.</p>
                     <p>I told you before, the People came in a Tumultuous Way to call for Justice: And half an Eye may see how, and by whom they were set on. In the mean time let me tell you farther, that this Art being once begun, without Consideration of the Danger, or Care of the Dishonour of such Proceedings; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever there was any thing proposed in the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> which it was thought <hi>the Lords</hi> would stick at, or <hi>the King</hi> not grant, by and by the Rabble came about the <hi>Houses,</hi> and called for this and that <hi>Justice,</hi> as they were prompted. God Bless the Government of this Kingdom, or all is lost.</p>

I must tell you farther, that from the time that the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> was first brought to his Answer in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> the bitter and fierce <hi>Libels</hi> of the factious People came daily out, to keep up and increase the Peoples Hate against him. And though they were full of most notorious Untruths, yet coming from that Party, were swallowed and believed by the most. Among di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others, they spread one, in which they delivered to the World, that the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> drawing near to his End, when he saw no Remedy, but he must Dye, fell into great and passionate Expressions against me; That I and my Counsels had been the Ruine of him and his House; and that he cursed me bitterly. Now as this is most false in it self, so am I most able to make it appear so. For his Lordship, being to Suffer on the <hi>Wednesday</hi> Morning, did upon <hi>Tuesday</hi> in the Afternoon desire the Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of <hi>Armagh,</hi> then with him, to come to me, and desire me that I would not fail to be in my Chamber Window at the open Casement the next Morning, when he was to pass by it, as he went to Execution; that though he might not speak with me, yet he might see me, and take his last leave of me. I sent him word I would, and did so. And the next Morning as he passed by, he turned towards me, and took the Solemnest leave, that I think was ever by any at distance taken one of another; and this in the sight of the Earl of <hi>Newport,</hi> then Lord Constable of <hi>the Tower,</hi> the Lord Primate of <hi>Armagh,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Cleveland,</hi> the <hi>Lieutenant of the Tower,</hi> and divers other Knights and Gentlemen of Worth. Besides, though during the time of both our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints, and the nearness of our Lodgings, we held no Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course each with other; yet Sir <hi>William Balfore,</hi> then Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> told me often what frequent and great expressions of Love <hi>the Earl</hi> made to me: Which cannot stand with that base Slander which the lewd <hi>Libel</hi> vented. But I leave that Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Person in his Grave, and while I live shall Honour his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. But must here a little go back.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>May</hi> the first, after <hi>the King</hi> had declared his Conscience <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Maij</hi> 1. 1641;</note> and his Judgment concerning the Earl of <hi>Strafford's</hi> Offences to both <hi>Houses</hi> (as is before set down) and was gone away, a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was read in the <hi>Vpper House</hi> from the <hi>Scots,</hi> in which their Army did earnestly desire to be gone. It was moved to have a present Conference with <hi>the Commons</hi> about it; and the Debate was very short, many Lords being desirous to lay hold of that Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to be rid of <hi>the Scots.</hi> But so good and so quick was the Intelligence from some of <hi>the Lords,</hi> that the <hi>House of Commons</hi> was risen before the Messengers from <hi>the Lords</hi> could get thither, and so the Conference was not only prevented, but things so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that the <hi>Scots</hi> stayed in <hi>England</hi> till the middle of <hi>August</hi> following, at a marvellous great Charge to the Kingdom, and with what Wrong and Dishonour to <hi>King and Kingdom,</hi> let Posterity Judge.</p>
                     <p>Before the Death of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> the <hi>Libels</hi> came out thick, and very Malitious against him. And all this to whet the Malice that was against him, and make the People more greedy
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54614:102"/>
for his Death. But no sooner was he gone into his Rest, but the <hi>Libellers,</hi> which during that time reviled him, fell on me; and no question but to the same end. And the <hi>Libels</hi> and <hi>Ballads</hi> against me were frequently spread through the <hi>City,</hi> and sung up and down the <hi>Streets.</hi> And (I thank God for it) they were as full of Falshood as Gall. Besides, they made base Pictures of me; putting me into a Cage, and fastning me to a Post by a Chain at my Shoulder, and the like. And divers of these <hi>Libels</hi> made Men sport in Taverns and Alehouses; where too many were as Drunk with Malice, as with the Liquor they sucked in. Against which my only Comfort was, that I was fallen but into the same Case with the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 69. <hi>For they that sat in the Gate</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">

                        <hi>spake against me, and I was the Song of the Drunkards.</hi> About this time I fell into a Tertian Ague, which was Comfortless in a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. But I humbly Praise God for it, after seven or eight Fits he restored me to my Health; the only Comfort which I have under him in this time of my Affliction.</p>

                           <hi>Junij</hi> 23. 1641.</note> of <hi>London,</hi> that now I had answered all Complaints come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me concerning the <hi>Vniversity of Oxford,</hi> I thought it requisite for me to Resign the <hi>Chancellorship</hi> of that place: And I gave <hi>His Majesty</hi> such Reasons, as he approved, for my so doing. And the truth is, I suffered much by the Clamours of the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> who thought it long, till he had that place, which he had long ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for: And after the Cloud was once spread over me, spared me in no Company; though I had in all the time of my Prosperity observed him in <hi>Court,</hi> more than ever he had deserved of me. And I had reason, notwithstanding all his causless Heat, to keep the place till I had justified my self against the <hi>Towns-Mens</hi> Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>the Lords;</hi> wherein they Charged me with no less than <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> for setting out a <hi>Proclamation</hi> about Regulating the <hi>Market</hi> in my own Name: But I made it appear to <hi>the Lords,</hi> that I did no more therein, than the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> time, or the Earl of <hi>Dorset</hi> in King <hi>James</hi> his time, did before me, when they were <hi>Chancellors</hi> of that <hi>Vniversity.</hi> And I was able to shew <hi>the Lords,</hi> and did so, the Copies of both their several <hi>Proclamations</hi> in Print in their own Names. And farther I made appear by the <hi>Vniversity Records,</hi> that the <hi>Chancellors</hi> for the time being had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently done it, ever since the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> 3: And that the <hi>Lord Mayor of London,</hi> and other <hi>Mayors</hi> having the <hi>Clark-ship of the Market,</hi> (as the <hi>Chancellors</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi> have, and not the <hi>Mayor</hi>) do it daily. So this great, and most Malicious Complaint of the City of <hi>Oxford,</hi> vanished, when they, and some body else for them had shewed their Teeth, but could not bite. But having ended this Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, and my <hi>Vice-Chancellor</hi> (whom I was not willing to Expose to anothers <note n="*" place="margin">f. <hi>Hatred.</hi>

But he let it cool, and gave that which is truly the <hi>Malignant Faction</hi> (but call others so) time to underwork him, and bring the City round, and all ran then stronger in the same Current than ever it did.

This made a mighty noise on all hands. But the business was so carried, that the <hi>House</hi> adjourned to sit in a <hi>Committee</hi> at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> and after at the <hi>Grocer's-Hall:</hi> Where things were so Ordered, that within two or three days, these Men were with great salutes of the People, brought, and in a manner guarded to the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,</hi> and after to the <hi>House at Westminster;</hi> and great stir made to and fro, about the Accusation of these Men, and the breach of the <hi>Priviledges of Parliament,</hi> by <hi>his Majesty's</hi> coming thither in that manner. Things were carried in a higher strain than ever before. The <hi>King</hi> left the City, and withdrew privately, first to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> after that to <hi>Windsor.</hi> Many puttings on and puttings off, concerning this and other great Affairs, between the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>House:</hi> All which I leave to publick <hi>Records,</hi> as not concerning this poor <hi>History:</hi> Yet could not omit to say thus much in the general; because much of the <hi>Church-business,</hi> as well as the <hi>States,</hi> and much of mine, as well as the <hi>Churches,</hi> will depend upon it.</p>

The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops have ever had this in Right and Possession ever since there was any use of Parliaments in <hi>England,</hi> which the antientest Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>the Nobility,</hi> which now sit there, and thrust them out, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say. There was great Joy upon the Passing of this <hi>Bill</hi> in both <hi>Houses,</hi> and in some Parishes of <hi>London</hi> Ringing and Bonfires. <hi>The King</hi> gave way to this <hi>Bill,</hi> and so that is setled: And if it after prove that the King and Kingdom have Joy in it, it is well. But it may be, that the Effects of this Eclipse may work farther than is yet thought on, and the Blackness of it darken the <hi>Temporal Lords</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, more than is yet feared. And here I must tell you two Things: The one, that for the compassing of their ends in this <hi>Bill,</hi> the now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>become-usual Art was pursued, and the People came in Multitudes, and Clamour'd for the outing of the <hi>Bishops and the Popish Lords Votes</hi> (so they were still joyned) out of <hi>the House.</hi> Insomuch, that not the People of <hi>London</hi> only, but Petitioners were brought out of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54614:106"/>
divers <hi>Counties</hi> with Petitions either sent unto them, or framed rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for them here against they came; and they in every Petition for preservation of <hi>the Priviledges of Parliament,</hi> desired the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <hi>of the Bishops and the Popish Lords Votes</hi> out of <hi>the House,</hi> as if it were a common Grievance: The other, That now the <hi>Bishops</hi> have their <hi>Votes</hi> taken away by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> you shall not see in haste any <hi>Bill</hi> at all Pass for taking away the <hi>Votes of the Popish Lords;</hi> which will infer this, as well as some other things, That these were joyned together, to make the <hi>Bishops</hi> more odious to the People, as if they were <hi>Popishly</hi> affected themselves, and to no other end.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Court</hi> removed from <hi>Windsor</hi> to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> and on <hi>Thurs-Day, Febr.</hi> 10. The <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> came to <hi>Greenwich;</hi> and on <hi>Friday,</hi>

But the true Cause of this intended Journey, was to be out of the Fears, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents and Dangers (as she conceived) of the present Times.

                     <p>ON <hi>Sunday, Feb.</hi> 20. there came a tall Gentleman, by the Name <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Feb.</hi> 20. 1641.</note> of Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> to my Lodging in the <hi>Tower</hi> to speak with me: I was then in my Bed-Chamber speaking with Mr. <hi>Edward Hide,</hi> one of the <hi>House of Commons.</hi> I went forth to speak with this Mr. <hi>Hunt.</hi> When I came, he professed, that though he was unknown to me, yet he came to do me service in a great Particular: And Prefaced it farther, that he was not set on to come to me by any <hi>States-Man,</hi> or by any of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> nor did expect any Reward, but only was desirous to serve me. I wondred what the matter should be. Then he drew a Paper out of his Pocket, and gave it me to read. It contained four <hi>Articles</hi> fairly Written, and drawn up against me to the <hi>Parliament.</hi> All of them were touching my near Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with <hi>Priests,</hi> and my endeavour by them to subvert Religion in <hi>England.</hi> He told me (when I had read them) that the <hi>Articles</hi> were not yet put into <hi>the House.</hi> They were subscribed by one <hi>Willoughby,</hi> who he said was a Priest, but now turned, and come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them. I asked him what Service it was that by this he could do to me? He said, he left me to think on that; but professed he looked for no advantage to himself. I conceived hereupon, this was some piece of <hi>Villany,</hi> and bad him tell <hi>Willoughby</hi> from me, that he was a <hi>Villain</hi> to subscribe such a Paper; and for the <hi>Articles,</hi> let him put them into the <hi>Parliament</hi> when he pleased. Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> desired me to take nothing ill from him, for he meant me Service. I reply'd, that he came to me Civilly, and used me in Speech like a Gentleman: But <hi>Willoughby</hi> was in this, as I had called him. I left him and his Paper, and returned to Mr. <hi>Hide</hi> into my Bed-Chamber. There I told him, and my Servant Mr. <hi>Richard Cobb,</hi> all that passed: And they were glad I gave him so short and so harsh an Answer, and did think as I my self did, that it was a Plot to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap me. After they were gone, I sat thinking with my self, and was very Sorry that my Indignation at this base <hi>Villany</hi> had made me so hasty to send <hi>Hunt</hi> away, and that I did not desire Mr. <hi>Lieutenant of the Tower</hi> to seize on him, till he brought forth this <hi>Willoughby.</hi> I am since informed, that this <hi>Hunt</hi> is a Gentleman that hath spent all or most of his Means; and I verily believe this was a Plot between him and <hi>Willoughby</hi> to draw Money from me to conceal the <hi>Articles;</hi> in which way had I complyed with him, I had utterly undone my self. But I thank God for his Mercy to me, I am Innocent, and defy in this Kind what any Man can tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say against me. On <hi>Friday, Mar.</hi> 4. the two <hi>Bishops</hi> which were <note place="margin">

At the same time the Petition of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ten <hi>Bishops</hi> (which were in <hi>the Tower</hi>) which was sent into
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:54614:107"/>
that <hi>House</hi> upon the Example of the other two was read. After this a <hi>Committee</hi> was named to draw up a <hi>Bill.</hi> But what it shall contain is not yet known: So herein they departed not from their former Resolution.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Sunday, Mar.</hi> 6. after I came from Sermon, I walked in a <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mar.</hi> 6. 1641.</note> large Room, of which I had the use, before I went to Dinner: And after I had walked a pretty while, expecting some Company, upon the sudden, as I walked on, I heard a great Crack, as loud as the Report of a small Dag, to my thinking. And the Noise being near me, I had a conceit that one of the Boards brake under me; but it was a <hi>Tendon</hi> of my right Leg which brake asunder, God knows how. For I was upon plain Boards, and had no uneven step nor slip, not so much as a turning of my Foot aside upon any Chink. This <hi>Tendon,</hi> or part of the main Sinew above my Heel, brake just in the same Place where I had unhappily broken it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Febr:</hi> 5: 1627. as I was waiting upon King <hi>Charles</hi> to <hi>Hampton-Court.</hi>

                           <hi>Feb.</hi> 5. 1627.</note> But I recovered of it, and could go strongly upon plain Ground. God be merciful unto me, now that he is pleased to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me yet farther, and to take from me the use of my Limbs, the only Comfort under him, in the midst of my Afflictions. And this Lameness continued two whole Months, before I was able to go down Stairs to take any Air to refresh my self; and long after, before I received any competent Measure of Strength.</p>

                     <p>This <hi>Order</hi> was brought me by the Church-Wardens, and some <note place="margin">Mar. <hi>19. 1641.</hi>
                        </note> of the Parish, on <hi>Saturday, March</hi> 19. I was sorry for the honest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent's sake, Mr: <hi>Ward;</hi> and troubled in my self to have such an <hi>Order</hi> sent me: Especially, considering that the <hi>Lords</hi> former Order (though as I was informed against all Law) yet was so mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, as to suffer me to Nominate to <hi>Benefices,</hi> so that the Men were without Exception. I put them off till <hi>Monday.</hi> In the mean time I advised with my <hi>Learned Councel,</hi> and other Friends. All of them agreed in this; That it was a great and a violent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice put upon me; yet in regard of the Time, and my Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they perswaded me to give way to their Power, and Present their Clerk. On <hi>Munday, Mar.</hi> 21. they repaired to me again: I <note place="margin">Mar. <hi>21. 1641.</hi>
                        </note> sent them to my <hi>Register,</hi> to draw a Presentation according to the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and advised them while that was in drawing, to send Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> to me. One of them told me very boldly, that it was not in the Order of <hi>Parliament,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> should come to me; and another told me that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> would not come to me. Upon this unworthy Usage of me, I dismissed them again, having first in Obedience to the <hi>Order</hi> Sealed and set my Hand to the Presentation, ready for delivery when Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> came
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:54614:108"/>
for it. The next Morning these men repair again to <hi>the Lords</hi> House, and on <hi>Wednesday, Mar.</hi> 23. procure another <hi>Order,</hi> strictly command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Mar. <hi>23. 1641.</hi>
                        </note> me forthwith to deliver the Presentation to the Parishioners.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Order</hi> being setled, the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> made a Motion, and put <hi>the Lords</hi> in Mind that I lay under a heavy Charge, and had long lain so: That it would be Honourable for <hi>the Parliament</hi> to bring my Cause to Hearing, that so I might receive Punishment if I were found to deserve it, or otherwise have some end of my Troubles: There was a great dispute among my Friends, <hi>Quo A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimo,</hi> with what Mind this Lord moved it, especially then, when almost all my Friends in both <hi>Houses</hi> were absent. Howsoever I took it for the best, desiring nothing more than an end; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sent a Gentleman the next Day to give his Lordship Thanks for his Nobleness in remembring me. And if he did it with an Ill Mind, God forgive him, and preserve me. But whatsoever his Lordship's Intent was, his <hi>Motion</hi> after some Debate, begat a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to <hi>the House of Commons,</hi> to ripen my Business; but it dyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and nothing done.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Order</hi> last above written, concerning Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> the Parishi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners brought to me the same Day in the Afternoon. It happened that the Lord Primate of <hi>Armagh</hi> was then with me. I shewed him the <hi>Order,</hi> and he blessed himself to see it; yet advised me to obey, as my other Friends had done. I farther desired him to stay and hear my Answer to them, which was this, That I knew not what Report they had made of me and my Obedience to <hi>the Lords;</hi> and that therefore I would give their Lordships in Write<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Account of my Proceedings; but would deliver the Presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> when he came. The Lord <hi>Primate</hi> cryed shame of them to their Faces: So they went away. On <hi>Thursday, March</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mar. <hi>24. 1641.</hi>
                        </note> 24. in an humble Petition I informed <hi>the Lords</hi> how ready I was to obey: Only desired that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> might come to me, that I might see his <hi>Orders,</hi> and examine his Sufficiency; to both which I stood bound both in Conscience, and by Law. Upon reading of this <hi>Petition,</hi> some Lords said Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> was an unmannerly Fellow, not to come to me: But the Lord <hi>Kimbolton</hi> told them he was a very worthy Man, and that he might go to me afterward; but it was fit their <hi>Order</hi> should be obeyed. And the Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> added, that I desired Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> might come to me, only that I might pick a Quarrel with him, to frustrate the <hi>Order of the House.</hi> Upon this there followed Instantly a <hi>Peremptory Order,</hi> commanding me to present Obedience. So Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> was left to come to me afterwards, if he pleased; and he came not at all, which was as good as if he had come, to have his Sufficiency examined for that which he had already in possession. But how worthy and fit he proved, I refer to all honest Men that heard him afterwards. Upon this <hi>Order</hi> (according to the former Advice of my Friends) I delivered the Presentation to the Churchwardens and Parishioners; and if any thing proved amiss in the Man (as after did in a high Measure) or hurtful in the thing it self; I humbly besought God to have Mercy on me, and to call for an Account of them who laid this pressure upon me.</p>

                     <p>BEfore this time the Rectory of <hi>Stisted</hi> in <hi>Essex</hi> was fallen void, and in my Gift. The <hi>E: of Warwick</hi> was an earnest Suitor to me for it, for one Mr: <hi>Clark:</hi> I delayed, having Six Months time by Law to dispose of my <hi>Benefices.</hi> During this delay Mr: <hi>Richard Howlett,</hi> a Batchelour of Divinity, and a Man of very good worth, a Dean in <hi>Ireland,</hi> was by <hi>the Rebels</hi> there turned out of all he had, and forced, for safety of his Life, to come with his Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren into <hi>England:</hi> His Wife was my near Kinswoman. At their coming over I was forced to relieve them, else they might have begged. Hereupon I resolved in my self to give <hi>Stisted</hi> to Mr: <hi>Howlett,</hi> and to gratifie Mr: <hi>Clark</hi> with something after. Nothing doubting but that the <hi>Parliament</hi> would readily give way in such a case of Necessity, for so worthy a Man as Mr: <hi>Howlett</hi> was known to be.</p>
                     <p>While these things were in my Thoughts, two other great <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> fell into my disposal, <hi>Bocking,</hi> and <hi>Lachingdon,</hi> both in <hi>Essex.</hi> Presently the Parishioners Petition me; They of <hi>Bocking</hi> for Dr: <hi>Gawden,</hi> a Chaplain of the Earl of <hi>Warwick's;</hi> They of <hi>Lachingdon,</hi> that they might chuse their own Minister. I gave a fair Answer to both, but reserved my self. Then I was pressed with Letters from the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> for Dr: <hi>Gawden.</hi> My Answer was, I could not gratifie Dr: <hi>Gawden</hi> with <hi>Bocking,</hi> and Mr: <hi>Clark</hi> with <hi>Stisted.</hi> Then Dr: <hi>Gawden</hi> brings me a very earnest Letter, but very Honourable, from the Earl of <hi>Hertford.</hi> When I saw my self thus pressed, I resolved to name fit Men to all three <hi>Benefices,</hi> presently, and see how the <hi>Parliament</hi> would be pleased to deal with me. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I did this, I thought fit to make a fair Offer to the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who by Dr: <hi>Gawden's</hi> intreaty came to me to the <hi>Tower.</hi> I freely told his Lordship my Resolution, which was, that at the desire of his Lordship, and my Honourable Friend the Lord <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess</hi> of <hi>Hertford,</hi> I would give <hi>Bocking</hi> to Dr: <hi>Gawden; Lachingdon</hi> to Mr: <hi>Howlett,</hi> in regard of his Alliance to me, and his present Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities; and <hi>Stisted</hi> to Mr: <hi>Newested,</hi> to whom I was pre-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by Promise to my Ancient worthy Friend Sir <hi>Tho: Rowe,</hi> whom Mr: <hi>Newested</hi> had served in his Embassages seven Years; and for Mr: <hi>Clark,</hi> he should have the next <hi>Benefice</hi> which fell in my Gift, for his Lordship's sake. His Lordship seemed to be very much taken with this Offer of mine, and promised me, and gave me his Hand upon it, that he would do me all the kindness he could, that these my Nominations might pass with <hi>the Lords.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon this I rested, and according to my Promise, Petitioned <hi>the</hi>

or nothing. This made me fear the worst: And therefore I advised Mr: <hi>Howlett</hi> to get a full Certificate of the Lord Primate of <hi>Armagh,</hi> both for Life and Learning, and attend with it at the <hi>Parliament,</hi> to make the best Friends for himself. The Business stuck still. At last he met with the Lord <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> who presently made all Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fair for him: And upon his Lordships motion to <hi>the House,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Apr.</hi> 13. 1642.</note> an <hi>Order</hi> passed for Mr: <hi>Howlett</hi> to have <hi>Lachingdon.</hi> The Motive this; Mr: <hi>Howlett</hi> was Fellow of <hi>Sidney</hi> College in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and Tutor at that time to two Sons of the Lord <hi>Mountague,</hi> the Lord <hi>Kimbolton's</hi> Uncle: At which time also the Lord <hi>Kimbolton</hi> himself was a Student in the same College, and knew the Person and worth of Mr: <hi>Howlett.</hi> This his Lordship Honourably now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred; else it might have gone hard with Mr: <hi>Howlett's</hi> Necessities. So upon the <hi>Order</hi> thus obtained, I Collated <hi>Lachingdon</hi> upon him.</p>
                     <p>After this the <hi>Earl of Warwick</hi> went <hi>Lord Admiral</hi> to Sea, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the <hi>Parliament:</hi> And forthwith I was served with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <note place="margin">

                        <hi>Order</hi> to give <hi>Stisted</hi> to Mr: <hi>Clark.</hi> Hereupon I Petitioned again, and set forth my Resolutions and Ingagements to <hi>Sir Tho: Rowe:</hi> And Dr: <hi>Gawden</hi> having told me, that the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> had left that Business for me in trust with the <hi>Lord Roberts,</hi> I made bold to write to his Lordship, and intreat his lawful Favour. The <hi>Lord Roberts</hi> denied that any such Order or Care of that Business was left with him, nor would he meddle in it; but referred me to the <hi>Lord Kimbolton,</hi> who still followed the Business close for Mr: <hi>Clark.</hi> By all which it appeared to me, that the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> had forgotten his Promise to me, to say no more.

They stayed there all Night, and searched every Room, and where any Key was not ready, brake open Doors: And the next Morning they carried my Arms away in Carts to <hi>Guild-Hall, London;</hi> and I was sufficiently abused all the way by the People, as my Arms passed. They gave out in <hi>London,</hi> there were Arms for Ten Thousand Men; whereas there was not enough for Two Hundred. And the Arms I bought of my Predecessor's Executors; only some I was forced to mend, the Fashion of Arms being changed. He left to defend that large House, but six Swords, six Carbines, three Halberds, and two half Pikes: Though the <hi>Order</hi> formerly made by <hi>the Lords,</hi> required ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary defence for the House should be left. But it seems Captain <hi>Royden's</hi> Order now given was stricter; for he was towards me and my House very Civil in all things.</p>

                        <hi>of Commons:</hi> And that Night there was great Ringing and Bonfires in the City; which I conceive was cunningly ordered to be done by Alderman <hi>Pennington,</hi> the new <hi>Lord Mayor,</hi> chosen in the room of Sir <hi>Richard Gurney,</hi> who was then in <hi>the Tower,</hi> and put out of his Office <hi>by the Parliament.</hi> And my Mind gives me, that if <hi>Bishops</hi> do go down, the City will not have cause to joy in it.</p>
                     <p>About this time the Cathedral Church of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was grosly Prophaned; yet far worse afterward.</p>

                           <hi>Feb.</hi> 3. 1642.</note> by the Death of the <hi>Dean of Canterbury,</hi> and in my Gift. It was a very good Benefice, and I saw it would create me much trouble in the Collating of it. The first onset upon me for it was by Dr. <hi>Heath;</hi> and it was to give it to Mr. <hi>Edward Corbet</hi> of <hi>Merton-College,</hi> of which House Dr. <hi>Heath</hi> had formerly been. Very earnest he was with me, and told me the <hi>Lord General</hi> was earnest for him, and that it would be carried from me, if I did it not willingly; which I were better do. My Answer was, I could not help that: But Mr. <hi>Corbet</hi> had many ways disserved me in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly I would never give it him. So we parted: And though I could not be jealous of Dr. <hi>Heath,</hi> yet neither could I take it well. And on <hi>Tuesday, Feb.</hi> 14. I received a Letter from <hi>his Majesty,</hi> bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Feb.</hi> 14.</note> Date <hi>January</hi> 17. in which Letters <hi>the King</hi> Commands me to give <hi>Chartham</hi> to one Mr. <hi>Reading,</hi> a Man of good Note in the Church; or if I were otherwise Commanded by <hi>Parliament</hi> not to give, then to Lapse it to him, that he might give it. I returned a present Answer by word of Mouth, and by the same Messenger, that I would either give, or Lapse the Benefice, as <hi>his Majesties</hi> Gracious Letters required of me.</p>
                     <p>I was now in a fine Case between <hi>the King</hi> and the <hi>Parliament:</hi> One I was sure to offend. Yet these Letters of <hi>the King's</hi> came hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily in one respect: For that very Afternoon, the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> came to me to <hi>the Tower,</hi> and after a few fair words bestowed on me, drew out an <hi>Order of Parliament,</hi> to give <hi>Chartham</hi> to one Mr. <hi>Culmer,</hi> who his Lordship said was a very worthy Man; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I might have believed his Lordship, had I not known the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: But I well knew him to be ignorant, and with his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, one of the most daring Schismaticks in all that Country. This <hi>Order of Parliament</hi> bare Date, <hi>Febr.</hi> 4. but was not shewed me till then. My Answer to my Lord was, that I had received a Letter from <hi>his Majesty,</hi> which required me to give that Benefice to another Man, or else Lapse it to him; and therefore humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired his Lordship to do me good Offices in the <hi>Honourable House,</hi> considering in what difficulties I was, and how many great Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings I had given by <hi>Orders of Parliament,</hi> and none at <hi>the King's</hi> Command till now. So we parted.</p>
                     <p>After this, Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> came to me about the Benefice, and protested his Conformity to the Church. I think the Man forgot that I knew both him and his ways. I told him I had given my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> my Answer. But Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> rested not so: But got a Servant of mine down the Stairs to him, and there was very earnest with him to know, whether it were not possible to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:54614:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
work me to give him <hi>Chartham.</hi> And then out of the abundance of his honesty and worthiness offer'd my Servant a Hundred and Fifty Pound to procure him the Benefice: And added, that he should have no cause to distrust him, for he should have the Money presently paid him. This is as worthy a piece of <hi>Symony</hi> as need to be: And but that the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> is a Man of Honour, and unfit to stoop to such base Courses, it is enough to make a Man think Mr. <hi>Culmer</hi> would have been very thankful to his Lordship for so much pains, as to come to <hi>the Tower</hi> and solicit for him. The Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> at his next opportunity in <hi>the House,</hi> told the <hi>Lords,</hi> that whereas they had made an <hi>Order,</hi> that the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> should give <hi>Chartham</hi> to Mr. <hi>Culmer,</hi> a very worthy Preacher; he had been with me himself about it, and that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Letters from <hi>the King,</hi> and refused to obey their <hi>Order.</hi> This was like to have stirred great Heat against me, but that a Lord stood up, and doubted of the <hi>Order;</hi> Putting them in Mind, that the <hi>Lord General</hi> was ingaged for this Benefice for Mr. <hi>Corbet,</hi> and had left the Care of it upon himself, and some other Lords in his absence. Hereupon there was inquiry made, when, and how, that Order passed for <hi>Culmer,</hi> and it was found to be slipped out at a very empty House. So the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> excused the Matter, that he knew not of the <hi>Lord General's</hi> purpose; and so the Business slept, and never awaked more for <hi>Culmer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lord Brook</hi> was now in Action. A bitter Enemy he was to the Church, and her Government by Bishops. On <hi>March:</hi> 2: he <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mar.</hi> 2. 1642.</note> was going to give Onset upon <hi>the Close</hi> of the Cathedral at <hi>Lich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field:</hi> And as he was taking view of the place, from a Window in a House opposite to <hi>the Close,</hi> and his Bever up, so that a Musket at such a distance could have done him but little harm; yet was he Shot in the left Eye, and killed Dead in the place without speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one word. Whence I shall observe three things. First, that this great and known Enemy to <hi>Cathedral-Churches</hi> died thus fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the Assault of a <hi>Cathedral.</hi> A fearful manner of Death in such a Quarrel! Secondly, that this happened upon <hi>Saint Chads</hi> Day, of which Saint the <hi>Cathedral</hi> bears the Name: Thirdly, that this Lord coming from Dinner about two Years since, from the Lord <hi>Herbert's</hi> House in <hi>Lambeth,</hi> upon some Discourse of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Church, then in their Eye upon the Water, said to some young Lords that were with him, <hi>that he hoped to live to see that one Stone of that Building should not be left upon another.</hi> But that Church stands yet, and that Eye is put out that hoped to see the Ruins of it. Many heavy Accidents have already fallen out in these unnatural Wars; and God alone knows, how many more shall, before they end: But I intend no History but of my own sad Misfortunes; nor would I have mentioned this, but that it relates to the Church, which for my Calling sake, I take as a part, and a near one of my self.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Friday, March</hi> 24. one Mr. <hi>Ford</hi> came to me to <hi>the Tower,</hi> and <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mar.</hi> 24. 1642.</note> told me, there was a Plot to send me, and my Lord of <hi>Ely</hi> Bishop <hi>Wren,</hi> as Delinquents, to <hi>New England,</hi> within fourteen days: And that Mr. <hi>Wells,</hi> a Minister that came thence, offer'd Wagers of it.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:54614:113"/>
The Meeting where he heard this, was (he said) at Mr. <hi>Barnes,</hi> a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers House in <hi>Friday-Street,</hi> a Son in Law of Mr. <hi>Fords.</hi> This Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman told me he was a <hi>Suffolk</hi> man; but I never saw him before, and was doubtful of the Truth of his Relation: Partly, because I knew no motive he had to take such care of me, being a Stranger to him; And partly, because it could not sink into me, that the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Houses,</hi> after so long Imprisonment, would send me into such a Banishment, without hearing me or my Cause. Yet he protested the truth of it very deeply, and wished me to endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it. That I knew not how to do: For to Petition against it upon such a private Information, might rather call it on, than keep it off, seeing what an edge there was against me. Therefore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred my self to God, my constant Anchor, and so rested my Thoughts as well as I could.</p>
                     <p>It was now known in the <hi>House</hi> to the <hi>Lord General's</hi> Friends, that I had a resolution not to give <hi>Chartham</hi> to <hi>Mr. Corbet:</hi> And it may be it was thought also, that I did but pretend <hi>the Kings</hi> Letters about it; and that if some other Man were named, against whom I had no Exception, it might be that I would give it: And if I did give it, then they should discover, that either I had no Letters from <hi>the King;</hi> Or that I could make bold to dispence with them, so <hi>Mr. Corbet</hi> were not the Man. And if they could have gained this upon me, that notwithstanding <hi>his Majesties Letters,</hi> I would have given that Benefice to another man, they would then have recalled their <hi>Order</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="margin">for <hi>Culmer.</hi>
                        </note> from him, and commanded me for <hi>Mr. Corbet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That this my Conjecture hath Truth in it, seems evident to me by all the future carriage of this Business. For one <hi>Mr. Hudson</hi> came and Preached at <hi>the Tower,</hi> and gave all men very good content: And on <hi>Tuesday, March</hi> 28. he brought me an <hi>Order</hi> from <note place="margin">

                        </note> the Lords, requiring me to give <hi>Chartham</hi> to him. And this <hi>Order</hi> was known in <hi>the Tower:</hi> For some Prisoners of Note said, I might do well to give it him, being so good a Preacher. My answer to him was fair; yet I told him truly, <hi>that the King</hi> had written to me for another: That I had promised to give it, or lapse it, as <hi>his Majesty</hi> required me: That <hi>the King</hi> never asked any of me till now: That I hoped <hi>the Parliament</hi> would not take it ill, that I gave this one at <hi>the Kings</hi> requisition, since I had already given as many Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices upon their <hi>Orders,</hi> as came to above Eight hundred Pounds a year, passing by my own Friends and Chaplains, honest and able men: And for his particular, I might live to pleasure him with another, so I were not over-pressed concerning this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hudson</hi> either mistook my Answer, or wilfully misreported it and me to the <hi>House;</hi> and thereupon came another <hi>Order</hi> to me of <hi>April</hi> 11. to give him <hi>Chartham.</hi> I was not willing to be mistaken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>April</hi> 11.</note> and therefore desired <hi>Mr. Lieutenant</hi> to deliver me a <hi>Petition to the House</hi> on <hi>Thursday, Apr.</hi> 13. in which I set forth my true Answer, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>April</hi> 13.</note> as is above expressed, and in all Humility desired their Favour. That very day another quick <hi>Order</hi> was made for <hi>Hudson,</hi> and brought to me the next day, <hi>April</hi> 14. I Petitioned the <hi>House</hi> again, the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>April</hi> 14.</note> same day, with all submission; yet professed, that I could not <hi>diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey</hi>
                        <pb n="203" facs="tcp:54614:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>the King</hi> in so fair a Command. When all this would not serve, the Mask was pulled off, and a peremptory <hi>Order,</hi> bearing date <hi>April</hi> 21. was brought to me on <hi>Saturday April</hi> 22. to Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late <note place="margin">

                           <hi>April</hi> 24.</note> I humbly gave my Answer, as before; but in the softest Terms I could express it, and in a <hi>Petition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Monday, May</hi> 1. the Windows of my Chappel at <hi>Lambeth</hi> were <note place="margin">
                           <hi>May</hi> 1.</note> defaced, and the Steps to the Communion-Table torn up. And on <hi>Tuesday, May</hi> 2. the Cross in <hi>Cheapside</hi> was taken down, to cleanse <note place="margin">
                           <hi>May</hi> 2.</note> that great Street of Superstition. The same day in prosecution of the former Plot, <hi>March</hi> 24. it was moved in the <hi>House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> to send me to <hi>New England;</hi> but it was rejected. The Plot was laid by <hi>Peters, Wells,</hi> and others of that Crew, that so they might insult over me.</p>
                     <p>Then followed an Exemplary piece of Justice, and another of <note place="margin">
                           <hi>May</hi> 9. 1643.</note> Mercy. Of Justice: For my Goods in <hi>Lambeth-House,</hi> and my Books were seized upon, and my Goods set to Sale by Captain <hi>Guest, Dickins,</hi> and <hi>Layton.</hi> And my Goods were sold, and scarce at a third part of their worth, all save what <hi>Layton</hi> took to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who usually said, all was his, House, Land, Goods and all. This was on <hi>Tuesday, May</hi> 9. And all this before any Proceedings had against me. And of Mercy: For the same day there came out an <hi>Order,</hi> for my farther Restraint, that I might not go out of my Lodging without my Keeper, so much as to take Air.</p>
                     <p>Much about this time I received another Letter from his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi> in which he requires me (as he had formerly done, for <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi> in particular) that as oft as any Benefice or other Spiritual Promotion whatsoever should fall void in my Gift, I should dispose it only to such as <hi>his Majesty</hi> should name unto me; Or if any Command lay otherwise upon me from either, or both <hi>Houses of Parliament,</hi> I should then let them fall into Lapse, that he might dispose of them to Men of worth.</p>
                     <p>Upon <hi>Tuesday, May</hi> 16. there came out an <hi>Ordinance of both Houses,</hi>

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> desirous to see whether I had any such Letter from <hi>the King,</hi> as I pretended: If I had not, they had advantage against me for my Falshood; if I had, they meant to see what Secret pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from <hi>his Majesty</hi> to me. Secondly, because I had lately Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned for Maintenance, and by this Search they might see what I had by me. And he that searched my Chamber, told me upon occasion, that he was to take all Papers which might discover De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents Estates. Thirdly, because all other Prisoners had their Papers re-delivered them before the Searchers went from <hi>the Tower;</hi> except some few Verses of Sir <hi>Edward Hern's:</hi> But mine were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the <hi>Committee;</hi> yet with promise, that I should have them again within two or three Days. Fourthly, because as <hi>Layton</hi> was put into <hi>Lambeth-House,</hi> so my implacable Enemy, Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> was picked out (as a Man whose Malice might be trusted) to make the search upon me. And he did it exactly.</p>
                     <p>The manner of the Search upon me was thus. Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> came into <hi>the Tower,</hi> with other Searchers, so soon as the Gates were open. Other Men went to other Prisoners; he made haste to my Lodging, Commanded the <hi>Warder</hi> to open my Doors, left two Musketeers Centinels below, that no Man might go in or out, and one at the Stair-head; with three other, which had their Muskets ready Cocked, he came into my Chamber, and found me in Bed (as were also my Servants in theirs.) <hi>I presently thought upon my Blessed</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>when</hi> Judas <hi>led in the Swords and Staves about him.</hi> Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> seeing me safe in Bed, falls first to my Pockets to rifle them; and by that time my two Servants came running in, half ready. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the sight of his Warrant; he shewed it me, and therein was Expressed, that he should search my <hi>Pockets.</hi> The Warrant came from the <hi>Close Committee,</hi> and the Hands that were to it, were <note place="margin">The Warrant may be found in <hi>Pryn's</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viat of the Life of the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop. p. <hi>28.</hi>

When my <hi>Pockets</hi> had been sufficiently ransacked, I rose and got my Cloaths about me, and so half ready, with my Gown upon my Shoulders, he held me in the search till past Nine of the Clock in the Morning. He took from me Twenty and One Bundles of <hi>Papers,</hi> which I had prepared for my Defence; the two <hi>Letters</hi> before named, which came to me from his <hi>Gracious Majesty</hi> about <hi>Chartham</hi> and my other Benefices; the <hi>Scottish Service-Book,</hi> with such Directions as accompanied it; a little Book, or <hi>Diary,</hi> containing all the Occurrences of my Life;
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:54614:115"/>
and my <hi>Book of Private Devotions;</hi> both these last written through with my own Hand. Nor could I get him to leave this last; but he must needs see what passed between God and me: A thing, I think, scarce ever offer'd to any <hi>Christian.</hi> The last place which he rifled, was a Trunk which stood by my Bed-side. In that he found nothing, but about Forty Pound in Money for my necessary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences (which he meddled not with,) and a Bundle of some Gloves. This Bundle he was so careful to open, as that he caused each Glove to be looked into; upon this I tender'd him one pair of the Gloves; which he refusing, I told him he might take them, and fear no Bribe, for he had already done me all the Mischief he could, and I asked no Favour of him: So he thanked me, took the Gloves, bound up my Papers, left two <hi>Centinels</hi> at my Door, (which were not dismissed till the next Day Noon,) and went his way. I was somewhat troubled to see my self used in this manner; but knew no help but in God, and the Patience which he had given me: And how his Gracious Providence over me, and his Goodness to me, wrought upon all this, I shall in the End discover, and will mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisie, however it succeed with me.</p>

In his Sermon, after he had liberally railed on me, he told the Auditory, that Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> had found <hi>a Book</hi> in my Pocket, which would discover great things: This to inflame the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple against me; <hi>Et si non satis insanirent suâ sponte, instigare.</hi> This is Zealous Preaching! God forgive their Malice.</p>
                     <p>An <hi>Ordinance</hi> passed on <hi>Munday, Junij</hi> 12. that the Synod of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Junij</hi> 12.</note> formerly Named by both <hi>Houses</hi> (not chosen by the Clergy) should begin to sit on the first of <hi>July</hi> following: And they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Julij</hi> 1.</note> to sit that day; Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> in the Chair; and he made the <hi>Latin</hi> Sermon. The Names of these Synodical Men, are to be seen in the <hi>Ordinance</hi> Printed <hi>Junij</hi> 12. Where any Man that will, may see a great, if not the greater part of them, <hi>Brownists,</hi> or <hi>Independents,</hi> or <hi>New-England-Ministers,</hi> if not worse, or at the best refractory Persons to the Doctrine or Discipline, or both, of the Church of <hi>England</hi> Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by Law, and now brought together to Reform it.

I shall for my part never deny, but that the <hi>Liturgy of the Church of</hi> England may be made better; but I am sure withal it may easily be made worse. And howsoever, it would become this <hi>Synod</hi> well, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that there is a <hi>Convocation</hi> of the <hi>English Prelates</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> lawfully Chosen and Summoned, and by no Supream or Legal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as yet dissolved: And can there be two National <hi>Synods</hi> at one time, but that one must be irregular?

                     <p>A Committee of the <hi>House of Commons</hi> sent Mr. <hi>Dobson</hi> my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trowler to me to the <hi>Tower,</hi> to require me to send them word under my Hand, what Originals I had of the <hi>Articles of Religion</hi> Established, 1562, &amp; 1571. This was on <hi>Wednesday, July</hi> 12. And I returned by <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Julij</hi> 12.</note> him the same day this Answer in Writing, with my Name to it.
<q>
                           <p>The Original <hi>Articles</hi> of 1571. I could never find in my Paper-Study at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> or any where else: And whether any Copy of them were ever left there, I cannot tell. The <hi>Original Articles of</hi> 1562. with many Hands to them, I did see, and peruse there: But whether the <hi>Bishops</hi> Hands were to them or not, I cannot
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:54614:116"/>
 remember.</p>
                        </q>
This Answer satisfied them; but what their Aim was I cannot tell, unless they meant to make a search about the two first Lines in the <hi>twentieth Article,</hi> concerning the Power of the Church; in these words: <hi>The Church hath Power to decree Rites or Ceremonies, and Authority in Controversies of Faith:</hi> Which words are left out in divers printed Copies of the <hi>Articles,</hi> and are not in the <hi>one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth Article of</hi> Edw. 6. nor in the <hi>Latin</hi> Copy of the <hi>Articles</hi> 1571. But in the <hi>Original Articles</hi> of 1562. the words are plain and manifest, without any Interlining at all. If this were their Aim, 'tis probable we shall see somewhat, by what their <hi>Synod</hi> shall do concerning that <hi>Article.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On <hi>Tuesday, August</hi> 3. my Servant Mr. <hi>Edw. Lenthrop,</hi> came to me <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aug.</hi> 3.</note> and told me, that the day before he met with Sir <hi>K. Digbye,</hi> who had the leave to go out of Prison, (by the Suit of the <hi>French Queen</hi>) and to Travel into <hi>France.</hi> But before he took his Journey, he was to come before a <hi>Committee,</hi> and there (he said) he had been. It seems it was some <hi>Committee</hi> about my Business; for he told Mr. <hi>Lenthrop,</hi> and wished him to tell it me, that the <hi>Committee</hi> took special notice of his Acquaintance with me, and Examined him strictly concerning me and my Religion, whether he did not know, that I was offer'd to be made a <hi>Cardinal;</hi> and many other such like things. That he An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd them, That he knew nothing of any <hi>Cardinal-ship</hi> offer'd me: And for my Religion he had Reason to think, I was truly and really as I professed my self; for I had laboured with him against his return to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> (Which is true, and I have some of my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers yet to shew.) But he farther sent me word, that their Malice was great against me; though he saw plainly, they were like Men that groped in the Dark, and were to seek what to lay to my Charge. But soon after Mutterings arose, that Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> in his Search had found great Matters against me, and that now I should be brought to Tryal out of Hand.</p>
                     <p>Some Men now it seems made Overture for Peace, and some good hopes of it began to shew themselves (as it was then said) in both <hi>Houses.</hi> This was on <hi>Saturday, Aug.</hi> 5. But there wanted not those, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aug.</hi> 5. 1643. <hi>Aug.</hi> 6.</note> which made themselves ready for Battel: For on <hi>Sunday, Aug.</hi> 6. Printed Bills were pasted up in <hi>London,</hi> to animate the People to go to <hi>Westminster</hi> against Peace; and the like Bills were Read in some Churches. Excellent Church-work! And on <hi>Munday, Aug.</hi> 7. some <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aug.</hi> 7.</note> Thousands, Men and Women; went to the <hi>Parliament</hi> and clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously Petitioned against Peace; and the next day five or six Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aug.</hi> 8.</note> Women, and these were as earnest for Peace: But ye may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, 'tis but Hundreds for Thousands that came against it. Yet on <hi>Wednesday, Aug.</hi> 9. the number of Women increased, when it seems <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aug.</hi> 9.</note> Men durst not appear. But their desire for Peace was answer'd by some Troops of Horse which were sent for, by which some of the Women were killed, and divers of them shrewdly wounded. God of his Mercy set an end to these bloody Distractions. In the midst of this Fury of the People, on <hi>Thursday, Aug.</hi> 10. came out <hi>Rome's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-Piece.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aug.</hi> 10.</note> This Book Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> sets forth in print, upon occasion of some Papers which he had in his search taken from me: And 'twas done to drive the People headlong into mischief, whose Malice against
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:54614:117"/>
me needed not his setting on. After this the <hi>Diurnal</hi> and other Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets began to mention me, and that now a Charge was drawing up against me.</p>
                     <p>Upon <hi>Friday, Aug.</hi> 11. Sir <hi>Robert Harlowe</hi> was made Lieutenant of <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aug.</hi> 11. <hi>Aug.</hi> 15.</note> the <hi>Tower,</hi> in the room of Sir <hi>Jo. Conniers.</hi> And on <hi>Tuesday, Aug.</hi> 15. he removed Mr. <hi>Bray,</hi> who had been my Warder from my first Commitment to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and put Mr. <hi>Cowes,</hi> another of the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to be my Keeper. The cause of this change I could never learn. The Nineteenth of <hi>Aug.</hi> after, being <hi>Saturday,</hi> Alderman <hi>Pennington,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aug.</hi> 19.</note> then <hi>Lord Mayor of</hi> London, was made Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and took possession of it. The next day being <hi>Sunday,</hi> in the Afternoon, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aug.</hi> 20.</note> one Preached in the <hi>Tower-Church,</hi> in a Buff-Coat and a Scarf, but had a Gown on. He told the People, they were all Blessed that dyed in this Cause, with much more such Stuff. His Name (as I then heard) was <hi>Kem,</hi> Parson or Vicar of <note n="*" place="margin">Low-Laigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</note> 
                        <hi>Loe-Layton</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> and then Captain of a Troop of Horse. <hi>Quam bene conveniunt!</hi> But the next <hi>Sunday, Aug.</hi> 27. during the Afternoon <hi>Sermon,</hi> a Letter, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aug.</hi> 27.</note> 
                        <hi>John Browne,</hi> was thrust under the Door of my Prison. When I opened it, I found it a most bitter <hi>Libel.</hi> God forgive the Author of it. On <hi>Munday, Septem.</hi> 11. the new Lieutenant the <hi>Lord Mayor,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>September</hi> 11.</note> changed my Warder again, removed Mr. <hi>Cowes,</hi> and put Mr. <hi>Spencer</hi> to attend me. And when I moved him, that I might not have such often change put upon me, as no other Prisoner had; His Answer was, that if he did not remove Mr. <hi>Cowes,</hi> the <hi>Committee</hi> would. So I knew not how to help my self, but by Patience.</p>
                     <p>Then came the <hi>Covenant,</hi> that excellent Piece of ...... from <hi>Scotland,</hi> and was Sworn by the <hi>Parliament</hi> and the <hi>Synod,</hi> in St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garets</hi>

                     <p>On <hi>Tuesday, Octob.</hi> 31. I humbly Petitioned <hi>the Lords</hi> for direction <note place="margin">Octob, <hi>31.</hi> The Petition may be found, apud <hi>Rushw.</hi> p. <hi>821. Pryn,</hi> p. <hi>42.</hi>

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:54614:118"/>
would declare no Opinion touching the distinguishment of the <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">See the Order of the Lords, <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 822. 42.</note> but left me to my <hi>Councel</hi> to advise as they pleased.

This seemed very hard, not only to my self and my <hi>Councel,</hi> but to all indifferent Men, that heard it. In the mean time I could resort no whither but to Patience and God's Mercy.</p>

                        <hi>Order,</hi> and was at the <hi>Bar.</hi> That which I spake <hi>to the Lords</hi> was this:
<q>
                           <p>That I had no Skill to judge of the Streights into which I might fall by my <hi>Plea,</hi> which I had resolved on, being left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all assistance of my <hi>Councel,</hi> in regard of the nature and form of <hi>the Impeachment,</hi> that was against me. That yet my Innocency prompted me to a ready Obedience of their <hi>Lordships Order,</hi> casting my self wholly upon God's Mercy, their Lordships Justice, and my own Innocency. Then I humbly desired that their Lordships  <hi>Order</hi> first, and the <hi>Impeachment</hi> after might be read.</p>
                        </q>
This done, I put in my <hi>Answer</hi> in Writing, as I was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to do, and humbly prayed it might be <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Vide</hi> Rushworth, <hi>p. 822:</hi> Pryn, <hi>p. 43. This</hi> Answer <hi>is otherwise worded in</hi> Pryn's <hi>Compl.

My Answer was: <hi>All Advantages of Law against this Impeachment saved and reserved to this Defendant, he pleads,</hi> Not Guilty <hi>to all, and every part of the Impeachment, in manner and form as 'tis Charged in the Articles:</hi> And to this Answer I put my Hand.
My Answer being thus put in, I humbly besought their Lordships

<q>to take into their Honourable Consideration, my great Years, being Threescore and ten compleat, and my Memory, and other Faculties, by Age and Affliction much decayed: My long Imprisonment, wanting very little of three whole Years, and this last year little better than close Imprisonment: My want of skill and knowledge in the Laws to defend my self: The Generality and Incertainty of almost all the Articles, so that I cannot see any Particulars against which I may provide my self. In the next place I did thankfully acknowledge <hi>their Lordships</hi> Honourable Favour in assigning me such <hi>Councel</hi> as I desired: But I told <hi>their Lordships</hi> withal, that as my <hi>Councel</hi> were most ready to obey <hi>their Lordships</hi> in all the Commands laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, so there were certain Doubts arisen in them, how far they might advise me without Offence; considering the Charges against me were so interwoven, and left without all distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:54614:118"/>
what is intended as a Charge of <hi>Treason,</hi> and what of <hi>Crime and Misdemeanour:</hi> That to remove these Doubts, I had humbly besought <hi>their Lordships</hi> twice for distinguishment, by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Petitions:</hi> That <hi>their Lordships</hi> not thinking it fit to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, I have without advice of <hi>Councel</hi> put in my <hi>Plea,</hi> as <hi>their Lordships</hi> see. But do most humbly pray, that <hi>their Lordships</hi> will take me so far into Consideration, as that I may not lose the Benefit of my <hi>Councel</hi> for <hi>Law</hi> in all, or any; and for <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Fact,</hi> in whatsoever is not Charged as Treason, when it shall be distinguished: As still my Prayers were, that by <hi>their Lordships</hi> Wisdom and Honourable Direction, some way might be found to distinguish them: And that having (not without much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty) prevailed with my <hi>Councel</hi> to attend; <hi>their Lordships</hi> would be pleased to hear them speak in this perplexed Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</q>
While I was speaking this, <hi>the Lords</hi> were very attentive, and two of them took Pen and Paper at the Table, and took Notes: And it was unanimously granted, that my <hi>Councel</hi> should <note place="margin">See the Order <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                           <hi>Rushw.</hi> p. 822. <hi>Pryn,</hi> p. 43.</note> be heard; and so they were. And the <hi>Order</hi> then made upon their Hearing was, that they should advise me, and be heard themselves in all things concerning matter of <hi>Law,</hi> and in all things, whether of <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Fact,</hi> that <note n="*" place="margin">were.</note> was not Charged as Treason; and that they would think upon the distinguishment in time convenient. This was all I could get, and my <hi>Councel</hi> seem'd somewhat better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that they had gotten so much. Not long after this, I heard from good Hands, that some of <hi>the Lords</hi> confessed, I had much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their expectation; for they found me in a Calm, but thought I would have been stormy. And this being so, I believe the two Lords so careful at their Pen and Ink, made ready to observe any Disadvantages to me, which they thought Choler and Indignation might thrust forth. But I praise God the Giver, I am better acquainted with Patience, than they think I am.</p>
                     <p>So this my main Business staid a while. In the mean time, that I might not rust, I was warned, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 8. to appear in <hi>Parliament</hi>

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:54614:119"/>
it was doubtless according to Law. Then upon a little further Speech, I recalled the Man to my Remembrance, and what care I took in Conference with him at <hi>London-House,</hi> to recall him from some of his turbulent ways; but all in vain: And now he inferred out of the good words I then gave him, that I Suspended him against my Conscience. In conclusion he told me, I went about to bring <hi>Popery</hi> into the Kingdom, and he hoped I should have my Reward for it. When I saw him at this heighth, I told him, he and his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, what by their Ignorance, and what by their Railing, and other boisterous Carriage, would soon actually make more <hi>Papists</hi> by far, than ever I intended; and that I was a better <hi>Protestant</hi> than he, or any of his Followers. So I left him in his Heat. This Man was brought to my Chamber by Mr. <hi>Isaac Pennington,</hi> Son to the Lieutenant.</p>
                     <p>By this time something was made ready again in my great Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: <note place="margin">

I could not obtain either the send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them before, or the suffering them to come behind, but with the Coach they must come; which was as good as to call the People about me. So from the <hi>Tower-gate</hi> to <hi>Westminster,</hi> I was sufficiently railed on, and reviled all the way. God of his Mercy forgive the misguided People. My Answer being put in, I was for that time

I received a Note from the <hi>Committee,</hi> which were to press the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence against me, what <hi>Articles</hi> they meant to begin with; which had a shew of some fair Respect; but the Generality and Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Articles</hi> was such, as rendred it a bare shew only; no Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular being charged, concerning which I might provide for any Witnesses or Counter-proof.</p>

                     <p>AND now being ready to enter upon the <hi>Hearing</hi> and the <hi>Tryal</hi> it self, I hold it necessary for me to acquaint the <hi>Reader</hi> with some <hi>General</hi> things before that begin: Partly to the end he may see the course of this <hi>Tryal,</hi> and the carriage which hath been in it; and partly to avoid the often and tedious Repetition, which else must necessarily be of some of them; and especially that they may not be mingled, either with the <hi>Evidence,</hi> or my <hi>Answers</hi> to it, to interrupt the Current, or make any thing more obscure.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Committee</hi> appointed by the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> to manage and press the <hi>Evidence</hi> against me, were <hi>Serjeant Wilde,</hi> Mr. <hi>Browne,</hi> Mr. <hi>Maynard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nicolas,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hill:</hi> But none spake at the Bar, but the first four; Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> was <hi>Consul-Bibulus;</hi> Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> was trusted with the providing of all the <hi>Evidence,</hi> and was <hi>Relater</hi> and <hi>Prompter,</hi> and all: Never weary of any thing, so he might do me mischief. And I conceive in future times, it will not be the greatest Honour to these Proceedings, that he, a Man twice Censured in the High Court of <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> set in the <hi>Pillory</hi> twice; once for Libelling the <hi>Queen's Majesty,</hi> and other Ladies of great Honour; and again for Libelling the <hi>Church,</hi> and the Government and Governours of it, the Bishops, and that had his Ears there cropt; should now be thought the only fit and indifferent Man to be trusted with the Witnesses and the Evidence against me, an <hi>Arch-Bishop,</hi> and sitting at his Censure.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> took to him two Young Men to help to turn his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and assist him; Mr. <hi>Grice,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Beck.</hi> Mr. <hi>Grice</hi> was Son to Mr. <hi>Tho. Grice,</hi> Fellow of St. <hi>Jo. Bapt. Colledge</hi> in my time, and after Beneficed near <hi>Stanes.</hi> I know not what the matter was, but I
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:54614:120"/>
could never get his Love: But he is Dead, and so let him rest. And now his Son succeeds, and it seems he Inherits his Father's Disposition towards me; for I hear his Tongue walks liberally o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me in all Places. For Mr. <hi>Beck,</hi> he hath received some Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie from me, and needed not in this kind to have expressed his Thankfulness. But I leave them both to do the Office which they have undertaken, and to grow up under the shadow of Mr. <hi>Pryn;</hi> God knows to what.</p>

It was told me by a Man of good Credit, that was present and heard it, That my Name coming in question among some Gentlemen, after divers had spoken their Thoughts of me, and not all one way, a <hi>Parliament-Man</hi> being there, was pleased to say, That I was now an Old Man, and it would be happy both for me and the <hi>Parliament</hi> that God would be pleased to take me away: And yet I make no doubt, but that if Age, or Grief, or Faintness of Spirit had ended my Days, many of them would have done <note place="margin">Scilicet (plus quam) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

After this when a Friend of mine bemoaned my Case to another <hi>Parliament-Man</hi> (of whom I had deserved very well) and said, he knew I was a good Man: The <hi>Parliament-Man</hi> replyed, <hi>Be he never so Good, we must now make him Ill for our own Sakes.</hi> What the meaning of these Speeches is, let understanding Men Judge. And even during my <hi>Tryal,</hi> some Citizens of <hi>London</hi> were heard to say, that indeed I answered many things very well: But yet I must suffer somewhat for the <hi>Honour of the House.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. So all my Hopes now, under God, lay wholly on the Honour and Justice of <hi>the Lords.</hi> Yet seeing how fierce many of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were against me, and how they had Clamour'd in other Cases, and that Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> was set up at once to mischief and to scorn me, and foreseeing how full of Reproaches my <hi>Tryal</hi> was like to be; I had a strong Tentation in me, rather to desert my Defence, and put my self into the Hands of God's Mercy, than indure them: But when I considered what Offence I should commit therein against the Course of Justice, that that might not proceed in the ordinary way; what Offence against my own Innocency and my good Name, which I was bound both in Nature and Conscience to maintain by all good means, which by deserting my Cause could not be: But especially, what Offence against God, as if he were not able to protect me, or not willing, in Case it stood with my Eternal Happiness, and his blessed Will of Tryal of me in the mean time; I say when I considered this, I humbly besought God for Strength and Patience, and resolved to undergo all Scorns, and whatsoever else might happen to me, rather than betray my Innocency to the Malice of any.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And though my Hopes under God were upon the <hi>Lords,</hi> yet when my <hi>Tryal</hi> came on, it did somewhat trouble me, to see so few Lords in that great <hi>House.</hi> For at the greatest Presence that was any day of my Hearing, there were not above Fourteen, and usually
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:54614:121"/>
not above Eleven or Twelve. Of these, one third part at least, each day took, or had occasion to be gone, before the Charge of the day was half given. I never had any one day the same Lords all present at my Defence in the Afternoon, that were at my Charge in the Morning: Some leading Lords scarce present at my Charge, four days of all my long Tryal, nor three at my Defence: And which is most, no one Lord present at my whole <hi>Tryal,</hi> but the Right Honourable the <hi>Lord Gray of Wark,</hi> the Speaker, without whose Presence it could not be a House. In this Case I stood in regard of my Honourable Judges.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. When my Hearing came on, usually my Charge was in giving till almost Two of the Clock. Then I was commanded to withdraw; and upon my Humble Petition for time to Answer, I had no more given me, than till Four the same Afternoon; scarce time enough ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly to peruse the Evidence: My <hi>Councel</hi> not suffer'd to come to me, till I had made my Answer, nor any Friend else, but my Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Mr. <hi>Dell,</hi> to help to turn my Papers; and my Warder of the <hi>Tower</hi> to sit by to look to this. And this was not the least Cause, why I was at first Accused of no less than <hi>Treason; Ne quis necessario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>

                        <hi>juvaret periclitantem Majestatis Crimina subdebantur,</hi> as it fell out in <hi>Silanus</hi> his Case, who had more Guilt about him (yet not of <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>) than (God be thanked) I have; but was prosecuted with like Malice, as appears in that Story. At Four a Clock, or after, the <hi>House</hi> sate again; and I made my Answer: And if I produced any Witness, he was not suffer'd to be Sworn; so it was but like a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony at large, which the <hi>Lords</hi> might the more freely believe or not believe, as they pleased. After my Answer, one, or more of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,</hi> replyed upon me. By that time all was done, it was usually half an Hour past Seven. Then in the heat of the Year (when it overtook me) I was presently to go by Water to the <hi>Tower,</hi> full of Weariness, and with a Shirt as wet to my Back with Sweat, as the Water could have made it, had I fallen in: Yet I humbly thank God for it, he so preserved my Health, as that though I were weary and saint the day after, yet I never had so much as half an Hours Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, or other Infirmity, all the time of this Comfortless and Tedious Tryal.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Now for the Method, which I shall hold in this <hi>History</hi> of my <hi>Tryal,</hi> it shall be this. I will set down the <hi>Evidence</hi> given on each day, by it self, and my <hi>Answer</hi> to it. But whereas all the <hi>Evidence</hi> was given together, and so my whole <hi>Answer</hi> after; to avoid all looking back, and trouble of turning Leaves to compare the <hi>Answer</hi> with the <hi>Evidence,</hi> I will set down each particular <hi>Evidence,</hi> and my <hi>Answer</hi> to it, and so all along, that the indifferent <hi>Reader,</hi> may without farther trouble, see the force of the one, and the satisfaction given in the other, and how far every Particular is from <hi>Treason.</hi> And if I add any thing to my <hi>Answers</hi> in any place, either it is because in the shortness of time then given me to make my Answer, it came not to my present Thoughts; or if it did, yet I forbare to speak it with that sharpness; holding it neither fit nor safe in my Condition, to provoke either my <hi>Accusers</hi> or my <hi>Judges.</hi> And whatsoever is so added by me, in either of these respects, the Reader shall find it thus marked in the Margent, as here it stands in this.</p>

8. Nor did I wrong Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> where I say, <note place="margin">Note, that where entire set <hi>Speeches</hi> were made by the Arch-Bishop, although spoken by him at the Bar, the same marks are put to it. But wheresoever those marks are found in the <hi>History,</hi> from the second to the last day of the <hi>Trial</hi> inclusive, the words to which they are affixed were not spoken at the Bar at that time, but either added afterwards by the Arch-Bishop at the <hi>Recapitulation</hi> of his Answer, or inserted in writing the History. <hi>H.

                        <hi>that for all the haste to put in my Answer,</hi> Jan. 22. <hi>he could not make this broken Business so soon ready against me:</hi> For 'tis well known, he kept a kind of School of Instruction for such of the Witnesses as he durst trust, that they might be sure to speak home to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he would have them. And this an <hi>Vtter Barrister,</hi> a Man of good Credit knows; who in the hearing of Men beyond Exception, said, <hi>The Arch-Bishop is a Stranger to me, but Mr.</hi> Pryn's <hi>tampering about the Witnesses, is so palpable and foul, that I cannot but pity him and cry shame of it.</hi> When I heard this, I sent to this Gentleman, to know if he tendered my Case so far, as to witness it before the <hi>Lords.</hi> The Answer I received was; that the Thing was true, and that very Indignation of it made him speak: But heartily prayed me, I would not produce him as a Witness; for if I did, the Times were such, he should be utterly undone: And 'tis not hard to guess by whom. Upon this I consulted some Friends; and upon regard of his safety on the one side, and my own doubt, lest if forced to his undoing, he might through Fear, blanch and mince the Truth to my own prejudice, who produced him; I forbare the business, and left Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> to the Bar of <hi>Christ,</hi> whose Mercy give him Repentance, and amend him.

                           <hi>Mar.</hi> 12. 1643.</note> for Introduction. I had a Character given me before of this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, which I will forbear to express; but in this Speech of his, and his future Proceedings with me, I found it exactly true. His Speech my decayed Memory cannot give you at large; but a <hi>Ske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leton</hi> of it I here present, according to such Limbs as my brief <note place="margin">See a Relation of what then passed, before <hi>Wild</hi> began his Speech, apud <hi>Rushw.</hi> p. <hi>827.</hi> and <hi>Wild's</hi> Speech entire, <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. <hi>828, &amp;c.</hi> and in <hi>Pryn's</hi> Compl. Hist. p. <hi>51, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> Notes then taken, can now call to my Memory.</p>
                     <p>He began, and <hi>told the Lords,</hi> That the Children, which I had travel'd with, were now come to the Birth; and that my Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were so foul, and my Treason so great, as that the like could not be read in any History; nay so great, as that <hi>Nullus Poet a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere,</hi> No Poet could ever fain the like: And that if all Treason were lost, and not to be found in any Author what it is, it might be recovered and found out in me and my Actions; with divers Pieces of <hi>Latin</hi> Sentences to this effect. [And though these high and loud Expressions troubled me much at the present; yet I could not but think, that in this <hi>Canto</hi> of his he was much like one of them which cry up and down the City, <hi>Have you any old Ends of Gold and Silver?</hi>]</p>
                     <p>After this he proceeded to give Reasons why I was not sooner proceeded against, having now lain by it above three years. The first Reason he gave, was the <hi>Distractions of the Time.</hi> [And they indeed were now grown great; but the Distractions which were now, can be no Argument why I was not proceeded against at the beginning of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> when things were in some better quiet.] His second <hi>Reason</hi> was the <note n="*" place="margin">The Death and dispersion of our Witnesses, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>Death of some Persons.</hi> [But this could be no reason at all: For if the Persons he speaks of were Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses against me, more might die, but the Dead could not be made alive again by this delay; unless <hi>Mr. Serjeant</hi> had some hope, the <hi>Resurrection</hi> might have been by this time, that so he might have produced them. And if the Persons were <hi>Members of the House of Commons,</hi> as all Men know <hi>Mr. Pym</hi> was in the Chair for Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Tryal; Then this is known too, that <hi>Mr. Pym</hi> came up to the <hi>Committee of Lords</hi> full of great hopes, to prove God knows what against me. The Persons to be examined, were <hi>William</hi> Lord Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Matthew</hi> Lord Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> my very Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Friends, and Men like to know as much of me as any Men. A Lord then present told me, there were some Eighteen or Nineteen Interrogatories, upon which these <hi>Bishops</hi> were to be Examined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, concerning my Intercourse with <hi>Rome;</hi> but all were built upon the first, which was their knowledge of the Man, who (it
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:54614:122"/>
seems) was thought to be my Chief Agent in that Secret. But both the <hi>Bishops</hi> denying upon their Oaths, that they, or either of them ever knew any such Man, all the rest of the Interrogatories, what Relations he had to me, and the like, must needs fall to nothing, as they did: And the Lord told me farther, he never saw <hi>Mr. Pym,</hi> and the rest, so abashed at any thing in his Life. After this <hi>Mr. Pym</hi> (as 'tis well known) gave over that Chair, despairing to do that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, which was desired.] His third <hi>Reason,</hi> was a good large one, and that was <note n="*" place="margin">The multitude of diversions, which we have had and have daily. So <hi>Wild's</hi> Speech, <hi>Ibid.</hi>

                        <hi>other Impediments.</hi> [And that's true, some Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments there were, no doubt, or else I had come sooner to Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And, as I conceive, a chief Impediment was, that there was not a Man whose Malice would make him diligent enough to search into such a forsaken Business, till <hi>Mr. Pryn</hi> offered himself to that Service: For I think I may be confident, that that Honourable and Great <hi>House</hi> would not seek any Man out of their own Body for any such Imployment, had not Suit, some way or other, been made for it.]</p>
                     <p>After these <hi>Reasons</hi> given for the delay of my <hi>Tryal,</hi> he fell upon me again as foul as at first; as that I was the Author of all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies in the Government, and of all the Concussions in the State: That the Quality of my Person aggravated my Crime: That my Abilities and Gifts were great, but that I perverted them all: And that I was guilty <hi>of</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Treason in the highest pitch and altitude. So <hi>Wild's</hi> Speech, p. <hi>52.</hi>

                        <hi>Treason in the highest Altitude.</hi> [These were the Liveries, which he liberally gave me, but I had no mind to wear them: And yet I might not desire him to wear this Cloth himself, considering where I then stood, and in what Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.]</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Treason in the Altitude,</hi> he said, was in my Endeavour to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Religion established by Law, and to subvert the Laws them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: And that to effect these I left no way unattempted. For <hi>Religion,</hi> he told <hi>the Lords,</hi> That I laboured a Reconciliation with <hi>Rome:</hi> That I maintained <hi>Popish</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> Opinions: That I suffered <note n="*" place="margin">

[And <hi>for the Laws,</hi> he was altogether as <hi>Wild</hi> in his Assertions, as he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for <hi>Religion:</hi> And if he have no more true sense of <hi>Religion,</hi> than he hath knowledge in the <hi>Law,</hi> (though it be his Profession) I think he may offer both long enough to Sale, before he find a Chapman for either.] And here he told <hi>the Lords,</hi> That I held the same Method for this, which I did for Religion.

For first, <hi>My Lords;</hi> Is it because of any <hi>Pledges</hi> I have in the World to sway me against my Conscience? No sure. For I have nor Wife nor Children, to cry out upon me to stay with them; and if I had, I hope the Call of my Conscience should be heard above them. Or Secondly; Is it, because I was loth to leave the <hi>Honour and the Profit</hi> of the Place I was risen unto? Surely no: For I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire <hi>your Lordships,</hi> and all the World else should know, I do much scorn <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Profit,</hi> both the one and the other, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of my Conscience.

                        <p>Or Thirdly: Is it because I lived here at <hi>ease,</hi> and was loth to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the loss of that? Not so neither: For whatsoever the World may be pleased to think of me, I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Nay, <hi>my Lords,</hi> I am as Innocent in this business of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as free from all <hi>Practice,</hi> or so much as thought of <hi>Practice</hi> for any alteration to <hi>Popery,</hi> or any way blemishing the True <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> Established in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as I was when my Mother first bare me into the World. And let nothing be spoken against me but Truth, and I do here Challenge whatsoever is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Heaven and Hell, to say their worst against me in point of my <hi>Religion:</hi> In which by God's Grace I have ever hated Dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and had I not hated it, perhaps it might have been better with me for worldly safety, than now it is. But it can no way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>Christian Bishop</hi> to halt with God.</p>
                        <p>Lastly; If I had any purpose to blast the True <hi>Religion</hi> Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and to introduce <hi>Popery;</hi> sure I took a very wrong way to it. For, <hi>my Lords,</hi> I have stayed <note n="*" place="margin">

I went patiently into the little Committee-Chamber at the entring into the <hi>House.</hi> Thither Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> followed me in great haste, and began to give me ill Language, and told me that
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:54614:126"/>
he, and other Ministers, were able to name Thousands <note n="*" place="margin">Hundreds of real Converts to Christ, for every one of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ones, and that himself had Converted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>120</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, <hi>Pryn,</hi> p. <hi>56.</hi>
                        </note> that they had Converted. I knew him not, as having never seen him (to my remembrance) in my Life, though I had heard enough of him. And as I was going to answer him, one of my Councel, Mr. <hi>Hearn,</hi> seeing how violently he began, stepped between us, and told him of his uncivil Carriage towards me in my Affliction: And indeed he came as if he would have struck me. By this time, some occasion brought the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> into that Room, and Mr. <hi>Hearn</hi> complained to him of Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> his usage of me; who very Honourably checked him for it, and sent him forth. Not long after, Mr. <hi>Hearn</hi> was set upon by <hi>Alderman Hoyle,</hi> and used as coursly as <hi>Peters</hi> had used me, and (as far as I remember) only for being of <hi>Councel</hi> with such a one as I; though he was assigned to that Office by <hi>the Lords.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What put them into this Choler, I know not; unless they were Angry to hear me say so much in my own Defence; especially for the Conversion of so many, which I think they little expected. For the next day a great Lord met a Friend of mine, and grew very Angry with him about me; not forbearing to ask what I meant, to Name the Particulars, which I had mentioned in the end of my <hi>Speech,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, many Godly Ministers had done more. And not long after this, (the day I now remember not) Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> came and Preached at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and there told them in the Pulpit, that a great Prelat, their Neighbour, (or in words to that effect) had bragged in the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-House,</hi> that he had Converted Two and Twenty; but that he had Wisdom enough, not to tell how many Thousands he had Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; with much more abuse. God of his Mercy relieve me from these Reproaches, and lay not these Mens causeless Malice to their Charge.</p>
                     <p>After a little stay, I received my Dismission for that time, and a Command to appear again the next day at Nine in the Morning: Which was my usual Hour to attend, though I was seldom called into the <hi>House</hi> in two Hours after.</p>

These three <hi>Articles</hi> they begun with; and the first Man appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to begin was Mr. <hi>Maynard:</hi> And after some general things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, as if I were the most violent Man for all illegal Ways; The First Particular charged against me was out of my <hi>Diary.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">I.</note> The Words these, The King <hi>Declared his Resolution for</hi> a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>in Case of the</hi> Scottish <hi>Rebellion. The First Movers of it were my Lord Deputy of</hi> Ireland, <hi>the Lord Marquess</hi> Hamilton, <hi>and my self: And a Resolution voted at the Board, to Assist</hi> the King <hi>in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Ways, if the</hi> Parliament <hi>should prove peevish, and refuse,</hi> &amp;c. The Time was <hi>Decemb.</hi> 5. 1639. That which was inforced from these Words, was, First, that I bestowed the Epithete <hi>Peevish</hi> upon the <hi>Parliament:</hi> And the Second, that this Voting <hi>to Assist the King in Extraordinary Ways, in Case the Parliament refused,</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from my Counsel.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To this I replyed: And first I humbly desired once for all, that all things concerning Law may be saved entire unto me, and my <hi>Councel</hi> to be heard in every such Particular.</p>

<q>
                           <p>Secondly, that the Epithete <hi>Peevish</hi> was a very Peevish Word, if written by me. I say, <hi>If:</hi> For I know into whose Hands my <hi>Book is fallen;</hi> but what hath been done with it I know not. This is to be seen, some Passages in that Book are half burnt out, whether Purposely, or by Chance, God knows: And some other Papers taken by the same Hand from me, are now want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. </p>
                        </q>
Is it not possible therefore some Art may be used in this? Besides, if I did use the Word <hi>Peevish,</hi> it was in my Private Pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et Book, which I well hoped should never be made Publick; and then no Disgrace thereby affixed to the <hi>Parliament.</hi> And I hope, should a Man forget himself in such an Expression of some Passage in some one <hi>Parliament,</hi> (and this was no more) it is far short of any thing that can be called <hi>Treason.</hi>

                           <p>And yet farther, most manifest it is in the very Words themselves, that I do not bestow the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle upon that <hi>Parliament,</hi> in that Case; but say only, <hi>If it should prove Peevish;</hi> which is possible, doubtless, that in some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars a <hi>Parliament</hi> may: Though for the Happiness of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, I would to God it were impossible.

3. Thirdly, Whereas 'tis said, That the <hi>Voting at the Council-Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to assist the King in Extraordinary Ways, if, &amp;c. was by my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel:</hi> There is no such thing in my <hi>Diary.</hi> There is, that I with others advised a <hi>Parliament:</hi> But there is not one Word, that the Voting mentioned at the <hi>Council-Table</hi> proceeded from any Advice of mine.
<q>
                           <p>So there is no Proof from my <hi>Diary;</hi> and other Proof beside that, was not so much as urged; which was not in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, but because they had it not. For had they had any other Proof, I see already, it should not have been lost for want of  urging.</p>
                        </q>
Where, I desired their Lordships also to observe, in what a difficulty I have lived with some Men, who will needs make me a great Enemy to <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and yet are angry with me, that I was one with others who moved for that <hi>Parliament.</hi> So it seems, nothing that I do can content some Men: For a <hi>Parliament,</hi> or against it; nothing must be well, if the Counsel be mine.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Fourthly, For <hi>the Voting of Assistance in Extraordinary Ways,</hi> I was included in the general Vote of <hi>the Table;</hi> and therefore that cannot be called or accounted my Counsel.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Fifthly, It is expressed in my <hi>Diary,</hi> whence all this Proof is taken; that it was in and for the <hi>Scottish</hi> Business, and so is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>the Act of Oblivion.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>And these Answers I gave to Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> when, in the summing up of the Charge against me in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <hi>House of Commons,</hi> he made this to be my Counsel to the <hi>King:</hi> And he began with it, in his Charging of the Points  against Law.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Second Particular this Day <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

This was attested by Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> the Elder, then a Counsellor, and present.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To this my Answer was, That I spake not these Words, either in Terms, or in Sense, to the uttermost of my Knowledge.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, If I had spoken these Words, either they were ill advised Words, but no Treason; and then they come not home to the Charge: Or they are Treasonable, and then I ought by <note place="margin">

<q>
                           <p>Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> in his Reply to me in the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> said, That this Statute ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired with the <hi>Queen,</hi> because it concerned none but her, and the Heirs of her Body.

                              </note> Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> as urging this Statute, and commending the Moderation of it. But I was therein mistaken for he speaks of 1. <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. And that <note place="margin">1 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. &amp; 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>c,</hi> 12.</note> Statute is in force, and is for Tryal within Six Months, for such Crimes as are within that Statute. So it comes all to one for my Cause, so either of the Statutes be in force. And to  this Charge in general, I gave the same Answers which are here.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> is in this a single Witness; whereas <note place="margin">1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 12. §. <hi>ult.</hi> &amp; 1 <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz. c.</hi> 6. §. <hi>ult.</hi>

                        <pb n="232" facs="tcp:54614:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>
4. Fourthly, both this and the former Charge relate to the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Business, and so are within <hi>the Act of Oblivion,</hi> which I have Pleaded.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Besides, here is nothing expressed in the Words Charged, which savours of Practice, Conspiracy, Combination or Force; and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore possibly be adjudged Treason; especially since there is no Expression made in the Words Witnessed, what Power is meant. For what should hinder <hi>the King</hi> to use his own Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? But <hi>Legal</hi> still: Since nothing is so properly a <hi>King's</hi> own Power, as that which is made or declared his own by Law. As for the Inference, That <hi>this was called his own, in opposition to Law:</hi> First, Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> is a Witness to the Words only, and not to any <hi>Inference:</hi> So the <hi>Words</hi> have but one Witness, and the <hi>Inference</hi> none. And perhaps it were as well for themselves, as for Persons questioned in great Courts, if they who are imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the Evidence, would be more sparing of their <hi>Inferences;</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">The dreadful Licence of Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences among our <hi>English</hi> Pleaders in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Death. <hi>Speed.</hi> in H. <hi>7. S. 61.</hi>

                        <p>Lastly, For the Honour of Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> let me not forget this; he is a Man of some Years, and Memory is one of the first Powers of Man, on which Age works; and yet his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry so good, so fresh, that he alone can remember Words spoken at a full <hi>Council-Table,</hi> which no Person of Honour remembers but himself. Had any Man else remembred such Words, he could not have stood single in this Testimony. But I would not have him brag of it: For I have read in St: <hi>Augustin,</hi> That <hi>Quidam Pessimi,</hi> some, even the worst of Men, have great Memories, and <note place="margin">Aug. <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>de</hi> Civ. Dei. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> are <hi>Tanto Pejores,</hi> so much the worse for having them. God  Bless Sir <hi>Henry.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </q>
                     <p>I have stayed the longer upon these Two, because they were apprehended to be of more weight than most which follow. The next was a Head containing my Illegal Pressures for Money, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the next Particular was, That in the Case of <hi>Ship-Money</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">III.</note> I was very angry against one <hi>Samuel Sherman</hi> of <hi>Dedham</hi> in <hi>Essex.</hi> That I should say <hi>Dedham</hi> was a Maritime Town: And that when the Sum demanded of him was Named, I should say, a <hi>Proper Sum;</hi> whereas the Distress came to eleven Subsidies.</p>
                     <p>To this I Answered: First, here was no Proof but <hi>Sherman;</hi> and in his own Cause. Secondly, he himself says no more, than that <hi>he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves</hi> I was the Instrument of his Oppression (as he called it;) whereas his Censure was laid upon him by the <hi>Council-Table,</hi> not by me: Nor was I in any other Fault, than that I was present, and gave my Vote with the rest. So here's no Proof at all, but his Belief.
<q>
                           <p>Lastly, here can be no Treason, but against <hi>Dedham,</hi>  or <hi>Sherman,</hi> that I can discover.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next to <hi>Sherman</hi> comes in my great Friend, <hi>Alderman</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">IV.</note> 
                        <hi>Atkins;</hi> and he Testifies, That when he was brought to the <hi>Council-Table,</hi> about the Ship-Money, none was so violent against him as I was, and that this Pressure for Ship-Money was before the Judges had given Sentence for <hi>the King.</hi> And that at another time I pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him hard to lend Money, <hi>the King</hi> being present: At which time
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:54614:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he conceived that I favoured <hi>Alderman Harrison</hi> for Country sake; because himself was Committed, and not the other.</p>
                     <p>To this I must confess, I did use to be Serious and Zealous too in <hi>his Majesty's</hi> Service; but not with any the least intention to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate Law. And if this here instanced were before the Judgment given for <hi>the King,</hi> yet it was long after the Judges had put the Legality of it under their Hands. And I for my part could not conceive the Judges would put that under their Hands to be Law, which should after be found unlawful. Therefore in this, as I Erred with Honourable Company at <hi>the Council-Table,</hi> so both they and I had, as we thought, sufficient Guides to lead us.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> which he puts upon me in preserving my Country-man, <hi>Alderman Harrison,</hi> from Prison: First, he himself durst not affirm it upon his Oath, but says only that <hi>he Conceives</hi> I fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured him; but his Conceit is no Proof. Secondly, if I had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured him, and done him that Office, 'tis far short of <hi>Treason.</hi> But the Truth is, <hi>Alderman Harrison</hi> gave a modest and a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Answer; but this Man was Rough, even to Unmannerliness, and, so far as I remember, was Committed for that.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>And whereas he says, I Pressed him hard to lend Money, and that none was so violent as I; he is much mistaken. For of all Men in that Fraternity, I durst never Press him hard for any thing, least of all for Money. For I knew not what Stuffing might fly out of so full a Cushion, as afterwards 'tis said did, when being a <hi>Colonel</hi> he was pressed, but not hard, in a little Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishing  in <hi>Finsbury-Fields.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Then it was urged, that I aggravated a Crime against <hi>Alderman</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">V.</note> 
                        <hi>Chambers,</hi> and told him, that if <hi>the King</hi> had many such <hi>Chambers</hi> he would have never a <hi>Chamber</hi> to Rest in: That in the Case of <hi>Tunnage and Poundage,</hi> he laboured to take Bread from <hi>the King:</hi> And that I Pressed upon him in the Business of <hi>Coat and Conduct-Money.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this I gave this Answer, That by the Affection Mr. <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> then shewed <hi>the King,</hi> I had some Reason to think, he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red so many <hi>Chambers</hi> to his use, that if <hi>the King</hi> had many such Subjects, he might want a <hi>Chamber</hi> for himself; or to that effect: And the violence of his Carriage in that Honourable Assembly gave just Occasion to other Men to think so. But as for the Business of <hi>Tunnage and Poundage,</hi> and of <hi>Coat and Conduct-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> I conceived both were Lawful on <hi>the King's</hi> part. And I was led into this Opinion by the express Judgment of some Lords pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and the Silence of others in that behalf; none of the great Lawyers at the <hi>Table</hi> contradicting either: And no Witness to this, but <hi>Alderman Chambers</hi> himself.</p>
                     <p>The sixth Particular was, That I urged the business of Ship-Money <note place="margin">VI,</note> upon <hi>Alderman Adams.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this my Answer was; That I never pressed the Ship-Money, but as other Lords did at <hi>the Council-Table,</hi> nor upon other grounds: Nor doth <hi>Alderman Adams</hi> say any more, than that he was pressed to this payment <hi>by me and others.</hi> And to me it seems strange, and will I hope to all Men else, that this, and the like, should be a common
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:54614:129"/>
Act of <hi>the Lords at the Council-Table,</hi> but should be <hi>High-Treason</hi> in no body but in me. And howsoever, if it be <hi>Treason,</hi> 'tis against three Aldermen, <hi>Atkins, Chambers,</hi> and <hi>Adams.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Seventh Particular was, that I was so violent about the slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">VII.</note> of the <hi>King's Proclamations,</hi> as that I said, A Proclamation was of as great force, or equal to a Statute-Law: And that I compared the <hi>King</hi> to the Stone spoken of in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> That <hi>whosoever falls upon it,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">

                        <hi>shall be broken; but upon whomsoever it falls, it will grind him to powder.</hi> And for this they brought three Witnesses, Mr. <hi>Griffin,</hi> and <hi>Tho. Wood,</hi> and <hi>Rich. Hayles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. This was in the Case of the Soap-business, and <note n="*" place="margin">two of the.</note> the two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses were Soap-boylers. They and their Company slighted all the <hi>Proclamations</hi> which the <hi>King</hi> set out; and all the Lords in the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> were much offended, (as I conceive they had great Reason to be) at the great and open daring of that whole <hi>Company.</hi> And whatsoever Sentence passed upon them in that whole Business, was given by the <hi>Court of Star-Chamber,</hi> not by me.</p>
                     <p>For the Words; First, these Men have good Memories, that can punctually, being plain ordinary Men, Swear Words spoken full Twelve Years since: And yet, as good as their Memory is, they Swear doubtfully touching the time; as that the Words were spoken in <hi>May</hi> 1632, or 33.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>my Lords,</hi> 'tis impossible these Words should be spoken by me. For I think no Man in this Honourable Presence thinks me so ignorant, as that I should not know the vast difference that is between an <hi>Act of Parliament and a Proclamation.</hi> Neither can these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which press the Evidence, think me so wilfully foolish so to speak, considering they accuse me here for a <hi>Cunning Delinquent.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>So  God forgive these Men the Falshood and the Malice of this Oath.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. For the Words spoken of <hi>the Stone in Scripture,</hi> 'tis so long since, I cannot recal whether I said it or no: Nor have I any great Reason to believe these Angry Witnesses in their own Cause. But if, by way of Allusion, I did apply that place to the <hi>King</hi> and them, 'tis far enough from <hi>Treason.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>And let them, and their like, take heed lest it prove true upon themselves: For seldom do Subjects fall upon <hi>their King,</hi> but in the end they are broken; and if it so  happen, that he falls upon them, they are ground to powder.</p>
                        </q>
And <hi>Salomon</hi> taught me this Answer, where he says, <hi>The Anger of a King</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>is Death.</hi> And yet I would not be mistaken. For I do not conceive this is spoken of a <hi>King</hi> and his Natural Anger, (though it be good Wisdom to stir as little Passion in Kings as may be;) but of his <hi>Legal Anger:</hi> According to which, if the <hi>Stone</hi> roul strictly, few Men can so Live, but for something or other they may be in danger of grinding.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And for these <hi>Soap-boylers,</hi> they have little cause to be so vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against me. For if the Sentence, passed against them in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> were in any thing illegal, though it were done by that <hi>Court</hi> and not by me; yet I alone, so soon as I heard but muttering of it, was the only means of resetling them and their Trade, which none of all the Lords else took care of.
<q>
                           <p>And the Summ of these Answers I gave to Mr. <hi>Browne,</hi> when he gave up the Summ of his Charge  against me.</p>
                        </q>

The next Particular was about <hi>Depopulations.</hi> A Commission of <hi>Grace,</hi> to compound with some Delinquents in that kind, was Issued <note place="margin">VIII.</note> under the Broad Seal, to some Lords and other Persons of Honour of the <hi>Council,</hi> of which I was one. One Mr. <hi>Talboys</hi> was called thither. And the Charge about this was, that when he pleaded, that by Statute 39. <hi>Eliz.</hi> he might convert some to Pasture, I should say, <hi>Do you plead Law here? Either abide the Order, or take your Tryal at the Star-Chamber:</hi> And that he was Fined 50 <hi>l.</hi>

                     <p>In this Particular Mr. <hi>Talboys</hi> is single, and in his own Cause; but I was single at no sitting of that <hi>Commission:</hi> Nor did I ever sit, unless the <hi>Lord Privy-Seal,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Secretary Coke</hi> were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; that we might have direction from their Knowledge and Experience.</p>
                     <p>And for the Words (if spoken) they were not to derogate from the Law; but to shew, that we sate not there as any Judges of the Law, but to offer <hi>his Majesty's</hi> Grace to such as would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Fine</hi> mentioned, we imposed none upon him or any other, but by the consent of the Parties themselves. If any Man thought he was not faulty, and would not accept of the Favour shewed him, we left him to the Law. But the plain truth is, this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> being Tenant to the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Christ-Church</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> offer'd them (as they conceived) great wrong in the Land he held of them; in so much as they feared other their Tenants might follow his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and therefore complained of him. And because I laid open his usage of his Landlords before the Commissioners, he comes here to vent his Spleen against me.
<q>
                           <p>And 'tis observable, that in all the business of <hi>Depopulations,</hi> in which so many appeared, no one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained either against me or any other Lord, but only this <hi>Talboys.</hi> Mr. <hi>Browne,</hi> when he pressed the Summ of this Charge against me, added, That at the <hi>Council-Table,</hi> I was for all Illegal Projects, as well as for these Inclosures. But First, I was neither for this nor any other, either longer or otherwise than I understood them to be Lawful. And Secondly, I opposed there the business of <hi>Salt</hi> and the <hi>Base Mony;</hi> and I alone took off that of the Malt, and the <hi>Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> And three Gentlemen of <hi>Hertfordshire</hi> (which County was principally concerned in the Case of the Malt) came over to <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>  to give me Thanks for it.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then was charged upon me the Printing of Books, which asserted <note place="margin">IX.</note> the King's Prerogative above Law, &amp;c. The instance was in Dr. <hi>Cowell's</hi> Book, <hi>Verbo,</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="margin">No such word there sure, it should be <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative Regis.</hi> W. S. A. C.</note> 
                        <hi>Rex:</hi> That this Book was decryed by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation; that Complaint was made to me, that this Book was Printing in a close House without Licence, and by <hi>Hodgkinson,</hi> who was my Printer; that I referred them to Sir <hi>John Lambe;</hi> that they came to me again, and a third time, and I still continued my Reference; which Sir <hi>John Lambe</hi> slighting, the Book came forth. The Witnesses to this, were <hi>Hunt</hi> and <hi>Wallye,</hi> if I mistook not their Names.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For this Book of Dr. <hi>Cowell's,</hi> I never knew of it, till it was Printed; or so far gone on in Printing, that I could not stay it: And the Witnesses say, <hi>it was in a close House, and without Licence;</hi> so neither I nor my Chaplains could take notice of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="236" facs="tcp:54614:130"/>
2. They say, they informed me of it, but name no time, but only the Year 1638. But they confess I was then at <hi>Croydon:</hi> So being out of Town (as were almost all the High Commissioners) I required Sir <hi>John Lambe,</hi> who being a High Commissioner, had in that business as much power as my self, to look to it carefully, that the Book pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not; or if it were already Printed, that it came not forth. If Sir <hi>John</hi> slighted his own Duty and my Command, (as themselves say) he is Living, and may answer for himself; and I hope <hi>your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships</hi> will not put his Neglect upon my Account.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As for <hi>Hodgkinson,</hi> he was never my Printer; but <hi>Badger</hi> was the Man whom I imployed, as is well known to all the <hi>Stationers.</hi> Nor was <hi>Hodgkinson</hi> ever imployed by me in that kind or any other: Upon just Complaint I turned him out of a place, but never put him into any: And therefore those Terms which were put upon me, of <hi>my Hodgkinson,</hi> and <hi>my Sir John Lambe,</hi> might have been spared. Sir <hi>John</hi> was indeed <hi>Dean of the Arches,</hi> and I imployed him, as other <hi>Arch-Bishops</hi> did the <hi>Deans</hi> which were in their Times; otherwise no way mine: And <hi>Hodgkinson</hi> had his whole dependance on Sir <hi>Henry Martin,</hi> and was a meer Stranger to me.
<q>
                           <p>And this Answer I gave to Mr. <hi>Browne,</hi> when he summ'd up the Charge. Nor could any danger be in the Printing of that Book to mislead any Man: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was generally made known by Proclamation, that it was a Book Condemned, and in such Particulars: But for other things the  Book very useful.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next Charge was, That when Dr: <hi>Gill,</hi> School-Master of <hi>Paul's</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">X.</note> School in <hi>London,</hi> was warned out by the <hi>Mercers</hi> (to the Care of which <hi>Company</hi> that School some way belongs) upon Dr: <hi>Gill's</hi> Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>King,</hi> there was a Reference to some other Lords and my self to hear the Business. The Charge is, that at this Hearing I should say, the <hi>Mercers</hi> might not put out Dr: <hi>Gill</hi> without his <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary's</hi> Knowledge: And that upon mention made of an <hi>Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> I should reply, <hi>I see nothing will down with you but Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; no regard at all of the Canons of the Church:</hi> And that I should farther add, <hi>That I would rescind all Acts which were against the Canons; and that I hoped shortly to see the Canons and the King's Prerogative of equal force with an Act of Parliament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this I Answer'd; That if all this Charge were true, yet this is but the single Testimony of <hi>Samuel Bland,</hi> an Officer belonging to the Company of the <hi>Mercers,</hi> and no small Stickler against Dr. <hi>Gill,</hi> whose Aged Reverend Father had done that <hi>Company</hi> great Service in that School for many Years together.</p>
                     <p>The Reference he grants was to me and others: So I neither thrust my self into the Business, nor was alone in it.</p>
                     <p>And as there is a <hi>Canon</hi> of this Church, That no Man may be allowed <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Can.</hi> 77.</note> to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And 'tis expressed in another Canon; <hi>That if any School-Master offend in any of the Premises</hi> (there spoken of) <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Can.</hi> 79.</note> 
                        <hi>he shall be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> by his Ordinary; and if he do not amend upon that his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>, he shall then be Suspended from Teaching:</hi> Which I think
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:54614:130"/>
makes the Case plain, that the <hi>Mercers</hi> might not turn out Dr. <hi>Gill,</hi> without so much as the Knowledge of his <hi>Bishop.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And for the Words; That <hi>I saw nothing would down with them but an Act of Parliament, and that no regard was had to the Canons;</hi> I humbly conceive there was no offence in the Words. For though the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority by far in this Kingdom belongs to the <hi>Acts of Parliament;</hi> yet some regard doubtless, is or ought to be had to the <hi>Canons of the Church:</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>And if nothing will down with Men but <hi>Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> the Government cannot be held up in many Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. </p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the other Words, God forgive this Witness: For I am well assured, I neither did nor could speak them. For is it so much as probable, that I should say, <hi>I would rescind all Acts that are against the Canons?</hi> What power have I or any particular Man, to rescind <hi>Acts of Parliament?</hi> Nor do I think any Man that knows me, will believe I could be such a Fool, as to say, That <hi>I hoped shortly to see the Canons and the Kings Prerogative equal to Acts of Parliament;</hi> Since I have lived to see (and that often) many <hi>Canons rejected,</hi> as contrary to the Custom of the Place; as in choice of <hi>Parish-Clerks,</hi> and about the Reparation of some Churches; and <hi>the King's Prerogative</hi> discussed and weighed by Law: Neither of which hath, or can be done by any Judges to an <hi>Act of Parliament.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>That there is Malice in this Man against me, appears plainly; but upon what 'tis grounded I cannot tell: Unless it be, that in this business of Dr. <hi>Gill,</hi> and in some other about placing <hi>Lecturers,</hi> (which in some Cases this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>the Mercers</hi> took on them to do) I opposing it so far as <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Canon</hi> would give me leave, crossed some way, either his Opinion in Religion, or his Purse-profit. I was (I confess) so much moved at the Unworthiness of this Man's Testimony, that I thought to bind this Sin upon his Soul, not to be forgiven him till he did publickly ask me Forgiveness for this Notorious Publick Wrong done me. But by God's Goodness I master'd my self; and I hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire God to give him a sense of this Sin against me his poor  Servant, and forgive him.</p>
                        </q>
And if these words could possibly scape me, and be within the danger of that <hi>Statute;</hi> then to that <hi>Statute,</hi> which requires my Tryal within six Months, I refer my self.</p>
                     <p>The Eleventh Charge of this day, was the Imprisonment of <note place="margin">XI.</note> Mr. <hi>George</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>f.</hi> Walker.</note> 
                        <hi>Waker,</hi> about a Sermon of his, Preached to prove (as he said) That 'tis Sin to obey the greatest Monarchs in things which are against the Command of God: That I had Notes of his Sermons for four or five Years together, of purpose to intrap him; That I told his <hi>Majesty</hi> he was Factious; That Sir <hi>Dadly Carlton</hi> writ to keep him close; That in this Affliction I protested to do him Kindness, and yet did contrary.</p>
                     <p>My Answer was; That for the Scope of his Sermon, <hi>To Obey God rather than Man,</hi> no Man doubts but it ought to be so, when the Commands are opposite. But his Sermon was viewed, and many factious Passages, and of high Nature, found in it. And yet I did not tell <hi>the King</hi> he was Factious, but that he was so complained of to me; and this was openly at the <hi>Council-Table.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="238" facs="tcp:54614:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And whereas he speaks of Notes of his Sermons for divers Years, with a purpose to intrap him; all that he says is, that <hi>he was told so,</hi> but produces not by whom. And truly I never had any such Notes, nor ever used any such Art against any Man in my Life. For his Commitment, it was done by the <hi>Council-Table;</hi> and after, upon some Carriage of his there, by the <hi>Court of Star-Chamber,</hi> not by me; nor can that be imputed to me, which is done there by the major part, and I having no Negative. And if Sir <hi>Dudly Carl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> writ to keep him close at his Brother's House, contrary to the Lords Order, let him answer it: And if he supposes that was done by me, why is not Sir <hi>Dudly</hi> examined to try that Truth? As for the <hi>Protestation,</hi> which he says I made to his Wife and his Brother, that I complained not against him; it was no Denyal of my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint made against him at the first, that I heard he was Factious; but that after the time, in which I had seen the full Testimony of grave Ministers in <hi>London,</hi> that he was not Factious, I made no Complaint after that, but did my best to free him. And the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in these two Charges is against the Company of the <hi>Mercers,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Waker.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next Charge was, that Dr: <hi>Manwaring</hi> having been Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured <note place="margin">XII.</note> by <hi>the Lords</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> for a Sermon of his against the Liberty and Propriety of the Subject, was yet after this preferred by me, in Contempt of the Parliament-Censure, both to the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery of <hi>Warcester,</hi> and the Bishoprick of St: <hi>Davids;</hi> And my own <hi>Diary</hi> witnesses that I was complained of in Parliament for it; And that yet after this I did consecrate him <hi>Bishop.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. To this I answered, that he was not preferred by me to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these; and therefore that could not be done in contempt of the Parliament-Censure, which was not done at all. For as for St: <hi>Davids,</hi> 'tis confessed, <hi>Secretary Windebank</hi> signified <hi>the King's</hi> Pleasure, not I. And whereas it was added, that this was by my means; That is only said, but not proved. And for <hi>Worcester,</hi> there is no Proof but the <hi>Docket-Book:</hi> Now, <hi>my Lords,</hi> 'tis well known in Court, that <hi>the Docket</hi> doth but signifie <hi>the King's</hi> Pleasure for such a Bill to be drawn, it never mentions who procured the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment: So that the <hi>Docket</hi> can be no Proof at all against me; and other there is none.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For the <hi>Sermon,</hi> 'tis true, I was complained of <hi>in Parliament,</hi> that I had been the Cause of Licensing it to the Press; and 'tis as true, that upon that Complaint, I was narrowly sifted, and an Honourable Lord now present, and the Lord Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> were sent to Bishop <hi>Mountain,</hi> who Licensed the <hi>Sermon,</hi> to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, and see, whether any Warrant had come from me, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Message: But when nothing appeared, I was acquitted in open <hi>Parliament;</hi> To some Body's no small Grief.
<q>
                           <p>God forgive them, and their Malice against me; for to my knowledge my Ruin was then thirsted for. And as I answered Mr. <hi>Brown's</hi> Summary Charge, when he pressed this against me, could this have been proved, I had been undone long since; the Work had not been  now to be done.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>That he was after Consecrated by me, is true likewise; and I
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:54614:131"/>
hope, 'tis not expected I should ruine my self, and fall into a <hi>Premu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire,</hi> by refusing the <hi>King's Royal Assent;</hi> and this for fear lest it <note place="margin">25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 20. §. <hi>ult.</hi>
                        </note> might be thought I procured his Preferment. But the Truth is, <hi>his Majesty</hi> commanded me to put him in mind of him when Preferments fell; and I did so: But withal I told <hi>his Majesty</hi> of his Censure, and that I fear'd ill Construction would be made of it.</p>
                     <p>To this it was replyed, That I might have refused to Consecrate, the Cause why being sufficient, and justifiable in <hi>Parliament,</hi> and excepted in that <hi>Law.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>But how sufficient soever that Cause may be in <hi>Parliament,</hi> if I had been in a <hi>Premunire</hi> there-while, and lost my Liberty and all that I had beside, for disobeying the <hi>Royal Assent;</hi> I believe I should have had but cold Comfort when the next <hi>Parliament</hi> had been Summoned; no Exception against the Man being known to me, either for Life or Learning, but only this Censure: Nor is there any Exception which the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi>  is by that Law allowed to make, if my <hi>Book</hi> be truly Printed.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then followed the Charge of Dr. <hi>Heylin's</hi> Book against Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">XIII.</note> out of which it was urged, That an unlimited Power was pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed very far; and out of <hi>p.</hi> 40. <hi>That a way was found to make the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heylin <hi>Cont.</hi> Burton, p. <hi>40;</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>free, and the King a Subject;</hi> that this Man was preferred by me; that Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> confessed to a <hi>Committee,</hi> that I commanded him to Answer Mr. <hi>Burton's</hi> Book; and that my Chaplain Dr. <hi>Braye</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed it.</p>
                     <p>I Answer'd as follows; I did not prefer Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> to <hi>the King's</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; it was the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> who had taken Honourable Care of him before in the University. His Preferments I did not procure: For it appears by what hath been urged against me, that the <hi>Lord Viscount Dorchester</hi> procured him his Parsonage, and Mr. <hi>Secretary Coke</hi> his Prebend in <hi>Westminster.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For his Answer to the <hi>Committee,</hi> that I commanded him to Write against <hi>Burton,</hi> It was an Ingenuous and a True Answer, and became him and his Calling well; for I did so.
<q>
                           <p>And neither I in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, nor he in Obeying, did other than what we had good Precedent for in the Primitive Church of <hi>Christ.</hi> For when some <hi>Monks</hi> had troubled the Church at <hi>Carthage,</hi> but not with half that danger which Mr. <hi>Burton's</hi> Book threatned to this; <hi>Aurelius,</hi> then Bishop, commanded St. <hi>Aug.</hi> to Write against it; and he did so. <note place="margin">Aug. <hi>2.</hi> Retract. c. <hi>21.</hi>
                              </note>  His Words are, <hi>Aurelius Scribere Jussit, &amp; feci.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </q>
But though I did, as by my Place I might, Command him to Write and Answer; yet I did neither Command nor Advise him, to insert any thing unsound or unfit. If any such thing be found in it, he must Answer for himself, and the Licenser for himself. For as for <hi>Licensing of Books,</hi> I held the same course which all my Predecessors had done: And when any Chaplain came new into my House, I gave him a strict Charge in that Particular. And in all my Predecessors Times, the Chaplains suffer'd for faults committed, and not their Lords; though now all is heaped on me.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>As for the particular Words urged out of Dr. <hi>Heylin's</hi> Book, <hi>p.</hi> 40. there is neither Expression by them, nor Intention in them, against either the Law, or any Lawful Proceedings; but they are directed to Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> and his Doctrine only. The words are: <hi>You have found out a way</hi> (not the Law, but you Mr. <hi>Burton</hi>) <hi>to make the</hi>
                           <pb n="240" facs="tcp:54614:132"/>
                           <hi>Subject free, and the King a Subject:</hi> Whereas it would well have beseem'd Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> to have carried his Pen even at the least, and  left <hi>the King</hi> his Freedom, as well as <hi>the Subject</hi> his.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>From this they proceeded to another Charge: which was, That I <note place="margin">XIV.</note> preferred Chaplains to be about <hi>the King</hi> and <hi>the Prince,</hi> which were disaffected to the Publick Welfare of the Kingdom. The Instance was in Dr: <hi>Dove:</hi> And a Passage Read out of his Book against Mr: <hi>Burton:</hi> And it was added, that the declaring of such disaffection, was the best Inducement or Bribe to procure them Preferment.</p>
                     <p>To this I then said, and 'tis true; I did never knowingly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any Chaplain to <hi>the King</hi> or <hi>Prince,</hi> that was ill-affected to the Publick. And for Dr. <hi>Dove,</hi> if he utter'd by Tongue or by Pen, any such wild Speech concerning any Members of the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>House of Commons,</hi> as is urged, thereby to shew his disaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the Publick; he is Living, and I humbly desire he may answer it. But whereas it was said, <hi>That this was the best Inducement or Bribe to get Preferment;</hi> This might have been spared, had it so pleased the <hi>Gentleman</hi> which spake it: But I know my Condition, and where I am, and will not lose my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience for Language.</p>
                     <p>And whereas 'tis urged, That after this he was Named by me, to be a Chaplain to the <hi>Prince his Highness;</hi> the Thing was thus, <hi>His Majesty</hi> had suit made to him, that the <hi>Prince</hi> might have Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in his own Chappel for his Family. Hereupon <hi>his Majesty,</hi> approving the Motion, commanded me to think upon the Names of some fit Men for that Service. I did so: But before any thing was done, I acquainted the Right Honourable the <hi>Lord Chamberlain,</hi> that then was, with it; my Lord knew most of the Men, and approved the Note, and delivered it to his Secretary Mr: <hi>Oldsworth,</hi> to Swear them. This was the Fact: And at this time, when I put Dr: <hi>Dove's</hi> Name into the List, I did not know of any such Passage in his Book, nor indeed ever heard of it till now. For I had not Read his Book, but here and there by snatches.</p>
                     <p>I am now come (and 'tis time) to the last Particular of this <note place="margin">XV.</note> day. And this Charge was, The giving of Subsidies to the <hi>King</hi> in the <hi>Convocation,</hi> without consent in <hi>Parliament;</hi> That the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for not paying were strict, and without Appeal, as appears in the <hi>Act;</hi> where it is farther said, that <hi>we do this according to the Duty which by Scripture we are bound unto;</hi> which reflects upon the Liberties of Parliaments in that behalf. But it was added, they would not meddle now with the late <hi>Canons</hi> for any thing else, till they came to their due place.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. My Answer to this was: That this was not my single Act, but the Act of the whole <hi>Convocation,</hi> and could not be appliable to me only.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That this Grant was no other, nor in any other way, <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis Mutandis,</hi> than was granted to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in Arch-Bishop <hi>Whitgift's</hi> time. This Grant was also put in Execution, as appeared by the <hi>Originals</hi> which we followed. These <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi> (among many other <hi>Records</hi>) were commanded away by
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:54614:132"/>
                        <hi>the Honourable House of Commons,</hi> and where they now are I know not: But for want of them my Defence cannot be so full.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For the Circumstances; as <hi>that the Penalties are without Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,</hi> and the like, 'tis usual in all such Grants. And <hi>that we did it according to our Duty and the Rules of Scripture,</hi> we conceived was a fitting Expression for our selves, and Men of our Calling, without giving Law to others, or any intention to violate the <hi>Law</hi> in the least. For thus, I humbly conceive, lyes the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Relation between the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>People,</hi> by Rules of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. The <hi>Subjects</hi> are to supply a full and Honourable Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to <hi>the King:</hi> And <hi>the King</hi> (when Necessities call upon him) is to ask of his People, in such a way as is, <hi>per pacta,</hi> by Law and Covenant agreed upon between them, which in this Kingdom is by <hi>Parliament;</hi> yet the Clergy ever granting their own at all times. And that this was my Judgment long before this, appears by a Sermon of mine, appointed to be Preached at the opening of the <hi>Parliament;</hi> in the Year 1625. My Words <note place="margin">My Sermon <hi>in</hi> Psal. <hi>75. 2, 3,</hi> p. <hi>14.</hi>
                        </note> are these. <hi>If you would have indeed a flourishing both State and Church; The King must trust and indear his People; and the People must Honour, Obey, and Support their King,</hi> &amp;c. This, I hope, is far enough from derogating from any Law: And if I should privately have spoken any thing to him contrary to this, which I had both Preached and Printed, how could <hi>his Majesty</hi> have trusted me in any thing?</p>

                     <head>CAP. XXV. <hi>The Fourth Day of my Hearing.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE fourth Day of my Hearing was <hi>Munday, March</hi> 18. and <note place="margin">Die Quarto.</note> was only my Answer to the third Day's Charge, and the only time in which I was not put to answer the same Day. The first Charge of this Day was about St. <hi>Pauls.</hi> And first out of my <note place="margin">I.</note> 
                        <hi>Diary;</hi> (where I confess it one of my Projects to repair that Ancient Fabrick:) And three strict Orders of the <hi>Lords of the Council</hi> for the demolishing of the Houses Built about that Church. One was <hi>Novemb.</hi> 21. 1634. The demolishing of the Houses commanded by this before <hi>Jan.</hi> 6. for one, and for the rest by <hi>Midsummer.</hi> Another was <hi>Mar.</hi> 26. 1631. a Committee appointed with Power to compound with the Tenants, and with Order to pull down, if they would not Compound. The third was <hi>Mar.</hi> 2. 1631. which gives Power to <hi>the Sheriffs</hi> to pull down, if Obedience be not yielded.</p>
                     <p>To this I confess I did, when I came first to be Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> Project the Repair of that Ancient and famous Cathedral of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ready to sink into its own Ruins. And to this I held my self bound in general, as Bishop of the Place; and in particular for the Body of the Church, the Repair of which is by the Local Statutes laid upon the <hi>Bishop.</hi> And the <hi>Bishop</hi> was well able to do it, while he enjoyed those Lands which he had, when that Burthen was laid upon him.
<q>
                           <p>But what Sacrilegious Hands despoiled that Bishoprick  of them, 'tis to no purpose to tell.</p>
                        </q>
And truly, <hi>my Lords,</hi> since I am in this present Condition, I humbly and heartily thank God, that St. <hi>Pauls</hi> comes into my Sufferings; and that God is pleased to think me worthy to suffer either for it, or with it any way: Though I confess I little thought to meet that here, or as a Charge any where else. And so God be pleased (as I hope in <hi>Christ</hi> he will) to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my other Sins, I hope I shall be able (Humane Frailties always set aside) to give an easie Account for this. But whereas I said, <hi>the Repair of St.</hi> Pauls <hi>was a strange piece of Treason.</hi> And they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently Replyed, that they did not Charge <hi>the Repair</hi> upon me, but the <hi>Manner of doing it, by demolishing of Mens Houses.</hi> To that I Answered as follows; with this first, that the Work hath cost me above One Thousand and two Hundred Pounds out of my own Purse, besides all my Care and Pains, and now this heavy Charge to boot: No one Man offering to prove, that I have Mis-spent or diverted to other use, any one Penny given to that work; or that I have done any thing about it, without the Knowledge, Approbation and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his <hi>Majesty,</hi> or <hi>the Lords of the Council,</hi> or both.</p>
                     <p>To the Particulars then. For the three <hi>Orders</hi> taken out of the <hi>Council-Books,</hi> I shall not need to repeat them. But what is the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, that these <hi>Orders</hi> are reckoned backward, the last first? Is it to aggravate, as if it rose by steps? That cannot well be; because
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:54614:134"/>
the first <hi>Order</hi> is the Sourest, if I conceive it right. Besides, here was real Composition allotted for them, and that by a Committee named by <hi>the Lords,</hi> not by me. And I think it was very real; for it Cost Eight or Nine Thousand Pounds (as appears upon the Accounts) meerly to take down the Houses (which had no Right to stand there) before we could come at the Church to Repair it.</p>
                     <p>And if any thing should be amiss in any of these (which is more than I either know or believe;) they were the <hi>Council's</hi> Orders, not mine. And shall that be urged as Treason against me, which is not Imputed to them so much as a Misdemeanour? Besides, the <hi>Lords of the Council</hi> are in the ancient Constitution of this Kingdom one Body; and whatsoever the Major Part of them concludes, is reputed the Act of the whole, not any one Man's. And this I must often Inculcate, because I see such Publick Acts like to be heaped upon my Particular.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The first Witness about this Business of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> is <hi>Mich. Burton,</hi> and 'tis charged that his House was pulled down in King <hi>James's</hi> time; That he was Promised relief, but had none: That hereupon he got a Reference from <hi>his Majesty</hi> that now is, and came with it to the <hi>Council,</hi> and was referred to the <hi>Committee.</hi> That Sir <hi>Hen. Martin</hi> told him that the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> was his hinderance. That he resorted to me, and that I bid him go to King <hi>James</hi> for his Recompence.</p>
                     <p>To this my Answer was, That this House, which he says was his, was (as is confessed by himself) taken down in King <hi>James's</hi> Time, when an attempt was made about the Repair of this Cathedral, but nothing done. If he desired satisfaction, he was to seek it of them who took down his House, not of me. If <hi>his Majesty</hi> that now is gave him a Reference, he was by the <hi>Lords of the Council,</hi> or by me (if to me it were Referred) to be sent to the Sub-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, because Satisfaction for each House was to be Ordered by them. Nor had I any Reason to take it on my Care, which was done so long before. He says, that Sir <hi>Henry Martin</hi> told him that I hindred him: But that's no Proof, that Sir <hi>Hen: Martin</hi> told him so: For 'tis but his Report of Sir <hi>Henry Martin's</hi> Speech: And I hope, Sir <hi>Henry</hi> neither did, nor would do me such apparent Wrong. He was the third Man to whom I brake my Intentions touching the Repair, and the Difficulties which I foresaw I was to meet with: And he gave me all Encouragement. And it may be, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would satisfie the eager Old Man, I might bid him go to King <hi>James</hi> for Recompence; but 'tis more than I remember if I did so. And this Man is single, and in his own Case; and where lyes the Treason that is in it? Besides, least Consideration was due to this House: For, not many Years before the Demolishing of it, it was Built at the West End of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> for a <hi>Lottery;</hi> (it was said to be the House of one <hi>Wheatly;</hi>) and after the <hi>Lottery</hi> ended, finished up into a Dwelling-House, to the great annoyance of that Church: The <hi>Bishop,</hi> and <hi>Dean,</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> being asleep while it was done.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The next Charge about St. <hi>Pauls</hi> was Witnessed by <hi>Mary Berry,</hi>
                        <pb n="246" facs="tcp:54614:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>
That her Husband was fain to set up his Trade elsewhere, and that every Man reported, the <hi>Bishop</hi> was the Cause of it.</p>
                     <p>Her Husband was forced by this Remove to set up his Trade elsewhere; so she says: And perhaps in a better Place, and with Satisfaction sufficient to make him a better Stock: Where's the Wrong? Beside, she is single, and in her own Cause, and no Proof, but that every Man reported the <hi>Bishop</hi> was the means to remove him. And it is Observable, that in King <hi>James</hi> his Time, when the Commission issued out for the demolishing of these very Houses, the Work was highly applauded; and yet no Care taken for Satisfaction of any Private Mans Interest:
<q>
                           <p>That now great Care hath been taken, and great Sums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney Expended about it, yet I must be a Traytor, and no less for doing it. This makes me think, some Party of Men were hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily angry at the Repair it self; though for very Shame it be  turned off upon the demolishing of the Houses.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The next that came in, was <hi>Tho: Wheeler:</hi> He says that his House was pulled down by the <hi>Committee,</hi> by my Direction, above Eleven Years ago: And that Word was brought him of it.</p>
                     <p>His House was pulled down; but himself confesses it was by the <hi>Committee.</hi> It was, he says, above eleven Years ago, and the time limited in that Article is <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Sixteen.</hi> vide.</note> 
                        <hi>Six</hi> Years. He says, that Word was brought him that I was the Cause, or gave the Direction. Word was brought him, but he Names not by whom, nor from whom; so all this Proof is a single Hearsay of he knows not whom: Whereas I had the <hi>Broad-Seal of England</hi> for all that was done. It was replyed here, That for demolishing of these Houses <hi>the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> was no full and legal Warrant; I should have procured Authority from <hi>Parliament.</hi> I replyed to this Interruption, That Houses more remote from the Church of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> were pulled down by <hi>the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="margin">See this Record twice referred to after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. In the latter Place the useful Words of it are recited. So that, perhaps, it will not be necessary to print the whole <hi>Patent;</hi> but if it be, I have a Copy of it. <hi>W. S. A. C.</hi> This came not to my Hands. <hi>H. W.</hi>
                        </note> only in <hi>K. Ed.</hi> 3. time; and humbly desired a <hi>Salvo</hi> might be entered for me, till I might bring the † <hi>Record;</hi> which was granted.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The last Instance for this Charge of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> was the House of <hi>W: Wakern;</hi> who Witnessed, that he had a Hundred Pound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for his House; but then was after Fined in the <hi>High-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission-Court</hi> 100 <hi>l.</hi> for Prophanation, of which he paid 30 <hi>l.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this I gave this Answer; That his Charge is true; and that after he had received 100 <hi>l.</hi> Composition, the Cry of the Prophanation brought him into the <hi>High-Commission.</hi> It was thus: The Skulls of Dead-Men (perhaps better than himself) were tumbled out of their Graves into his Draught, and part of the Foundation of the Church (as appeared in the taking down of his House) was broken, or pared away, to make room for the uncleanness to pass into the Vault: And surely were I to sit again in the <hi>High-Commission,</hi> I should give my Vote to Censure this Prophanation. But himself confesses, he paid but Thirty Pound of it, which was too little for such an Offence. And besides, <hi>my Lords,</hi> this was the Act of the <hi>High-Commission,</hi> and cannot be charged singly upon me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="247" facs="tcp:54614:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And I cannot forbear to add thus much more, That the <hi>Bishop, and Dean, and Chapter,</hi> whoever they were, did ill to give way to these Buildings, and to increase their Rents by a Sacrilegious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue: No Law that I know giving way to Build upon Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated Ground, as that <hi>Church-Yard</hi> is. But howsoever, the present Tenants being not <hi>in Dolo,</hi> I ever thought fit they should have Recompence for their Estates, and they had it.</p>
                     <p>The next Charge was about the Shops of <hi>the Goldsmiths</hi> in <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">II.</note> and <hi>Lumbard-street.</hi> An Order was made at <hi>the Council-Table, Novemb.</hi> 12. 1634. That within Six Months the <hi>Goldsmiths</hi> should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide themselves Shops there, and no where else, till all those Shops were furnished: And this under a Penalty, and to give Bond.</p>
                     <p>These two were the ancient Places for <hi>Goldsmiths</hi> only, Time out of Mind: And it was thought fit by <hi>the Lords,</hi> for the Beauty of the Place, and the Honour of the City, to have these Places fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished as they were wont, and not to have other Trades mixed among them. Beside, it concerned all Mens Safety: For if any Plate were stoln, the enquiry after it might be made with more ease and speed: Whereas if the <hi>Goldsmiths</hi> might dwell here and there, and keep their Shops in every by-place of the City, stoln Plate might easily be made off, and never heard of. But howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if in this Order there were any thing amiss, it was <hi>the Order of the Council-Table,</hi> not mine: And far enough off from <hi>Treason,</hi> as I conceive.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Upon this Charge there were two Instances. The first is Mr: <hi>Bartley;</hi> who said, his House was taken from him, by Order <hi>to the Lord Mayor,</hi> 1637. That my Hand was to the <hi>Order;</hi> That he was Imprisoned Six Months, and recovered 600. <hi>l.</hi> Damages of Sir <hi>Ed. Bromfield;</hi> That after this he was Committed to <hi>Flamsted,</hi> a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger belonging to the <hi>High Commission,</hi> about <hi>Dr. Bastwick's</hi> and Mr. <hi>Burton's</hi> Books; That after this he was sent for to the <hi>Council,</hi> and there heard my Voice only; That when he desired some help, Sir <hi>Tho. Ailsbury's</hi> Man told him, he were as good take a Bear by the Tooth: That all this was for his entertaining a Man that came out of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and lastly, That Dr. <hi>Haywood,</hi> my Chaplain, had Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a <hi>Popish</hi> Book.</p>
                     <p>To which I gave this Answer: That if the Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> put him from his house, by Order from <hi>the Lords</hi> (being a <hi>Stationer</hi> among the <hi>Goldsmiths</hi>) then it was not done by me: And though my Hand were to the <hi>Order,</hi> yet not mine alone; and I hope my Hand there subscribed no more Treason than other Lords Hands did: And if he did recover 600 <hi>l.</hi> against Sir <hi>Ed. Bromfield,</hi> who (I think) was the <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> spoken of, surely he was a Gainer by the Business. And whereas he says, he was after seized again, and Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Flamsted</hi> about the Books Named: If he were (as was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) a great Vender of those, and such like Books, less could not be done to him, than to call him to Answer. He says farther, that he was sent for to the <hi>Council-Table,</hi> and there he heard my Voice only against him. It may be so, and without all fault of mine: For that heavy Office was usually put upon me and <hi>the Lord Keeper,</hi> to deliver the Sense of <hi>the Board</hi> to such as
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:54614:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were called thither, and Examined there: And by this Means, if any sour or displeasing Sentence passed (how just soever, it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered not) it was taken as our own, and the Envy of it fell on us. And that this was so, many Lords here present know well. He adds what Sir <hi>Thomas Ailsbury's</hi> Man said, when he would have Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned again: But since Mr. <hi>Bartley</hi> is single here, and in his own Cause, why doth he rest upon a Hearsay of Sir <hi>Thomas Ailsbury's</hi> Man? Why was not this Man Examined to make out the Proof? And if this Man did so far abuse me, as to speak such Words of me, shall I be Abused first, and then have that Abuse made a Charge? That he was troubled thus for a <hi>Scotchman's</hi> coming to him, is nothing so, nor is any Proof offered: Though then the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles were begun in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and therefore if this had any relation to that Business, I pleaded again the <hi>Act of Oblivion.</hi> For that of Dr. <hi>Haywood,</hi> I shall give my Answer in a more proper Place; for 'tis objected again.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The second Instance was in Mr <hi>Manning's</hi> Case. He speaks also of the Order of the <hi>Council, Novemb.</hi> 12. 1634. That the <hi>Goldsmiths</hi> in their Book make an Order upon it, <hi>June</hi> 15. 1635. That they which obey not, should be suspended, (I think 'tis meant from use of their Trade;) That when some intreated them to Obedience, I should say, <hi>This Board is not so Weak, but that it can Command;</hi> or to that effect.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>Council's Order,</hi> it was theirs, not mine. For the Order which the <hi>Company of Goldsmiths</hi> made upon it, It was their own Act, I had nothing to do with it. For the Words, If I did speak them (which is more than I remember) he is single that Swears them, and in his own Cause. But, <hi>my Lords,</hi> I must needs say, whether I spake it then, or not, most true it is, that the <hi>Council-Table</hi> is very weak indeed, if it cannot Command in things of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and for Safety of the Subject, and where there is no Law to the contrary. And this was then my Answer.</p>
                     <p>The Third Charge of this Day, was, That I forced Men to <note place="margin">III.</note> lend Money to the Church of St: <hi>Pauls:</hi> And Mrs: <hi>Moore</hi> was called upon. But this was deserted.</p>
                     <p>The next Charge was concerning a long and tedious Suit between <note place="margin">IV.</note> 
                        <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>Poole,</hi> about the Parsonage of <hi>North-Cerny</hi> in <hi>Glocester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire;</hi> That <hi>Rich</hi> was turned out after three Years Possession, by a Reference procured by <hi>Poole,</hi> to the <hi>Lord Keeper Coventry</hi> and my self; And that I did in a manner Act the whole Business at the Reference; That Letters were sent from the <hi>Council</hi> to Sir <hi>William Masters,</hi> one of the Patrons, to see <hi>Poole</hi> Instituted, and to Imprison <hi>Rich</hi> if he refused Obedience: That after, by the <hi>Lord Marshal's</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement, there was another Reference obtained to thirteen Lords; who awarded for <hi>Rich.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I was never more weary of any Business in my Life, than I was of this Reference: And I was so far from Acting the whole Business, as that I did nothing, but as the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> directed; the Cause was so entangled with <hi>Quare Impedits,</hi> and many other Businesses of Law. Our Judgments upon full Hearing went with <hi>Poole,</hi> and we certified accordingly: And upon this (it may
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:54614:136"/>
be) the Letters mentioned were sent down for <hi>Poole.</hi> And if the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> that now is, then <hi>his Majesty's Solicitor,</hi> could not, or durst not meddle, but gave back his Fee (as was farther urged) his Lordship is living to tell the Cause himself; for here was none set down, though it were urged, as if he did it because I was a <hi>Referree:</hi> And in the mean time this is but a bare Report concerning him. If the thirteen Lords, to whom it was after referred, were of another Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that was nothing to us, who without any touch of Corruption, did as our Knowledge and Conscience guided us. And, <hi>my Lords,</hi> it seems this Title was very doubtful; for after all this, it came into this <hi>Parliament,</hi> was referred to a <hi>Committee,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Rich</hi> was very willing to compound the Business.
<q>
                           <p>And well he might; for I was since certified by a Gentleman, a Lawyer, that understood well, and was at the Hearing of that Cause, that it was one of the foulest Causes on <hi>Rich's</hi> side, that ever he heard. And out of this I took the Summ of my Answer, which I gave to Mr. <hi>Browne,</hi> when he  Summed up my Charge.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Witnesses to this Charge were Mr. <hi>Rich</hi> his Brother, and my good Friend Mr. <hi>Talboys.</hi> But this latter witnesses nothing but that he heard me say, that <hi>Poole's</hi> Behaviour was unfit; so there I checked the one Party: And that upon some words given me by <hi>Rich,</hi> I should say, <hi>do you throw dirt in my face?</hi> And why might I not ask this Question, if his words deserved it? So upon the Matter, here is <hi>Rich</hi> single in his Brother's Case; and nothing throughout that looks like <hi>Treason.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here I had a snap given me, that I slighted the Evidence, whereas they (as 'twas said) did not urge these Particulars as Treason, but as things tending to the violation of Law, and should be found to make Treason in the <hi>Result.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>The Truth is, I did then think within my self, that such Evidence might very well be slighted in an Accusation  of Treason.</p>
                        </q>
But I thought better to forbear; and so, in my continued patience, expected the next Charge.</p>
                     <p>Which was Mr: <hi>Foxlie's</hi> Imprisonment about <hi>Popish Books.</hi> That he <note place="margin">V.</note> was tender'd the Oath <hi>ex Officio;</hi> then brought before the <hi>Council,</hi> and imprisoned again by a Warrant under my Hand and others; and my Hand first to the Warrant; his Wife not suffer'd to come to him, till he was sick; that the chief Cause of all this was the Impropriations, because he desired to Name the Men for the <hi>Feoffment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>My Lords,</hi> This Man confesses, he was called in question about <hi>Popish-Books;</hi> but expressing no more, I cannot tell what to make of it; nor can I tell how to Accuse him of <hi>Popish Books.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>For I cannot  tell which is least, his Understanding of them, or his Love to them.</p>
                        </q>
And for tendring him the Oath <hi>ex Officio,</hi> that was the usual proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that Court. When he was brought before <hi>the Lords of the Council,</hi> he says the Warrant for his Imprisonment <hi>was under my Hand and others.</hi> This was according to course: So the Commitment of him was by <hi>the Lords,</hi> not by me. <hi>But my Hand was first;</hi> so was it in all things else, to which I was to set it. And the restraint of his Wife from coming to him, was by the same Order of the <hi>Lords:</hi> And upon her Petition, when her Husband was sick, both of them confess she had admittance. But whereas he says, The chief Cause of
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:54614:137"/>
his Commitment was the <hi>Feoffment,</hi> he is much mistaken: Himself says before it was about <hi>Popish Books.</hi> This I am sure of, the <hi>Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> was not so much as mentioned against him: Though he freely confesses, that he got twelve Men to undertake that <hi>Feoffment,</hi> which was a great deal more power than he could take to himself by Law. And his Wife speaks not one word to the Cause of his Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So he is single, and in his own Cause; and no Treason, unless it be against Mr. <hi>Foxlye.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next Charge of this day, was Mr: <hi>Vassall's</hi> Imprisonment: <note place="margin">VI.</note> And to save Repetition, I shall weave all the circumstances of Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and my Answer together.</p>
                     <p>First, he is single in all, both Substance and Circumstance. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he says <hi>that he conceives I was the cause of his Imprisonment.</hi> But his Conceit is no proof. He says again, that I said at the <hi>Council-Table</hi> (whither he was called,) <hi>Why sit we here, if we be not able to Judge?</hi> It may be, <hi>my Lords,</hi> I said so; I remember not now; but if I did say so, it was of such things only, as were fit and proper for that Honourable <hi>Board</hi> to judge of. Then he Charged me, that I should there say, <hi>That he did eat the Bread out of the</hi> King's <hi>Childrens Mouths; and that if he were in another Country he would be Hang'd for it.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>I doubt this Gentleman has borrowed some of Sir <hi>Hen. Vane's</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory:  But I remember no such thing.</p>
                        </q>
Yet if I did say it, it was no <hi>Treason:</hi> For if I did say he might be Hang'd for the like in some other Country; it was because the Laws and Customs of other Countries, and this of ours, differ in many things. So that by this Speech, he was to thank the Law of the Land for his preservation, notwithstanding his opposition against <hi>Majesty;</hi> which, where the Laws were not so favourable to the Subject, would not be indured.</p>
                     <p>He says, <hi>He was fain to deposite</hi> 300 <hi>l. into the Hand of Sir</hi> Abra. Dawes, <hi>and that it was taken out the next day:</hi> But he says withal, it was done by a Decree at the <hi>Council-Board;</hi> and I hope I shall not be held Author of all Decrees which passed there. He says, that I called him <hi>Sirrah:</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>A high Crime, if I did so! High Treason at least!</p>
                        </q>
But sure this <hi>Gentleman's</hi> Spleen swell'd up <hi>Sir</hi> into <hi>Sirrah:</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>For that is no Language of mine to meaner Men than Mr. <hi>Vassal</hi> is. The main of this Charge is Words; and those (if utter'd) hasty, not Treaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: And as <hi>M. Lepidus</hi> spake in the Case of <hi>C. Lutorius Priscus,</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Tacit. L. <hi>3.</hi> Annal.</note> 
                              <hi>Vana à scelestis, dicta à maleficiis differunt;</hi> vain things differ from wicked, and words from malicious deeds; and let any Man else be sifted as I have been for all the time I have been a <hi>Bishop,</hi> which is now upon the point of Twenty and three Years, and I doubt not but as high Words as these will be heard fallen from him upon less occasion, and of greater Personages than Mr. <hi>Vassal</hi> is. Besides, Mr. <hi>Vassal,</hi> at the end of his Testimony, desired the <hi>Lords</hi> he might have Reparation; which altogether in Law infirms that which  he Testified.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this followed a Charge about a Grant passed from <hi>his Majesty</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">VII.</note> to one Mr. <hi>Smith.</hi> The difference was between Mrs. <hi>Burrill</hi> and him. As far as I can recall, it was thus. The King had made a Grant to Mr. <hi>Burrill,</hi> in his Life time, of a Wharf or something else belonging to the <hi>Thames.</hi> Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> conceals this, and gets a Grant from <hi>his</hi>
                        <pb n="251" facs="tcp:54614:137"/>
                        <hi>Majesty,</hi> over the Head of the Widow and her Children. And, as himself confesses, <hi>His Majesty</hi> being informed that Mrs. <hi>Burrill</hi> was Sister to the Reverend Prelate Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> being then dead, <note n="*" place="margin">did.</note> should say, that he would not have granted it to Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> had he known so much. This was an Honourable Memory of his faithful Servant, her Worthy Brother. But whatsoever was done in this business, was by Order of the <hi>Council-Board,</hi> and not by me: As was also the 250 <hi>l.</hi> which (he says) was paid in to Sir <hi>William Beecher,</hi> (by way of deposite, as I conceive;) In which if he had any hard Measure, the Law was open for his Right. And in the whole busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness he is single, and in his own Cause.</p>
                     <p>The next Charge was Sir <hi>Jo: Corbett's;</hi> which because it is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <note place="margin">VIII.</note> at large in the <hi>Article</hi> before recited, I shall not here repeat, but apply the Answer to it, which I then gave.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>John</hi> says, he <hi>was sent for about Reading the</hi> Petition of Right, <hi>at a</hi> Sessions <hi>in the Country; and that the Earl of</hi> Bridgwater <hi>should say, he was disaffected to the King.</hi> This concerns not me in any thing. He says, <hi>That for this he was Committed, lay long in the</hi> Fleet, <hi>and was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied Bail:</hi> But he says it was denyed by the whole <hi>Board.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>So by his own Confession, this was the Act of the <hi>Council,</hi> not mine. And  this Answer I gave to Mr. <hi>Browne,</hi> when he put this part of the Charge into his Summ.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In his Cause with Sir <hi>John Stonehouse</hi> about a Waste, I cannot recal the Particulars: But what-ever was done therein, himself confesses was by Order at the <hi>Council-Table,</hi> and <hi>His Majesty</hi> present, <hi>April</hi> 18. 1638.</p>
                     <p>For the Ile built by the <hi>Lord Viscount Kilmurrye;</hi> the Grant which I made was no more, than is ordinary in all such Cases: And 'tis expressed in the Body of the Grant, <hi>Quantum in nobis est, &amp; de Jure possumus;</hi> so there is nothing at all done to the prejudice of Sir <hi>John's</hi> Inheritance: For if we cannot Grant it by Law, then the Grant is voided by its own words. And that the <hi>Grant</hi> was such, and no other, I shew'd the Deeds ready Attested out of the Office. Besides, had I wronged him, there was an ordinary Remedy open, by Appeal to the <hi>Delegates.</hi> And this was well known to him; for he did so Appeal from a like <hi>Grant</hi> against him, by the now Lord Bishop of <hi>Duresme,</hi> then of <hi>Lichfield,</hi> and Sir <hi>John's</hi> Diocesan. And whereas 'tis alledged, <hi>That I made this Grant without the consent of him the Patron, or the then Incumbent;</hi> Sir <hi>John</hi> acknowledges, like a Gentleman, that I sent unto him for his consent, if it might have been had. And this I foresaw also, that if I had denyed the <hi>Lord Viscount</hi> that which was not unusual; then the Complaint would have fallen more heavy on the other side, that I made Persons of Quality in a manner <hi>Recusants,</hi> by denying them that conveniency which was in my power to grant. So I must be faulty, whatever I do.</p>
                     <p>Then the business of the <hi>Tythes of London</hi> was raised up in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">IX.</note> against me. And it was Read out of my <hi>Diary,</hi> that I projected to give the Ministers assistance therein.</p>
                     <p>I had been much to blame, having been <hi>Bishop of London,</hi> should I have had other thoughts. For their Case is very hard; all their <hi>Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi> being shrunk a way into nothing, but a poor <hi>Easter-Book.</hi> The
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:54614:138"/>
Ministers of <hi>London</hi> had often petitioned about some Relief long before my time: And I did then, and do still think it most just, they should have it.
<q>
                           <p>For they are now under the Taskmakers of <hi>AEgypt;</hi> the <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>

                        </q>
And yet I never thought of any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law, had all been done which I desired. For that was no more, than that the Citizens would voluntarily yield to some reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable addition, where Right and Need appeared: And this, I am sure, nor did nor could cross with the <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> concerning the <hi>Tythes of London.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Moss,</hi> who is their only Witness in this particular, says no more against me, but that <hi>I pressed this business much, and often:</hi> Which is most true I did, and held it my Duty so to do; but still in the way before mentioned.</p>
                     <p>After this came the great Charge (as it was accounted) concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">X.</note> the Censure of Mr: <hi>Pryn,</hi> and <hi>Burton,</hi> and <hi>Bastwick,</hi> in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> and their Banishment (as 'tis called) upon it. The Witnesses produced in some Circumstances of that Cause, were Mr: <hi>Cockshott, Tho: Edwards, William Wickens,</hi> Mr: <hi>Burton,</hi> Mrs: <hi>Bast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke,</hi> and Mr: <hi>Pryn</hi> himself. The Censure is known, and urged to be against Law: But so far as any Particular is put upon me, my Answer is present to it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. And first for Mr: <hi>Cockshott,</hi> he says, Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> Bancks <hi>sent him</hi> (being then his Servant) <hi>to give me an Account of that Business:</hi> Hence 'tis inferred, That I took care of it. This might have had some shew of Proof, if I had sent to Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> to give me an account of it. But there's no word of any such Proof. And yet, considering what relation their Cause had to the Church, if I had sent and desired some Account of the Proceedings; I humbly conceive (my Place in the Church considered) it could have been no great Crime.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Then were Read certain Warrants: One <hi>Febr.</hi> 1. 1632. for Commitment; another of <hi>Febr.</hi> 2. 1636. to bar access to them. These were Acts of the Lords sitting in <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> not mine. Then was Read a third <hi>Order</hi> after Sentence given, of <hi>May</hi> 13. 1634. <hi>for the seizing of his Books.</hi> But this, as the former, was an Act of the Court; not mine: And 'tis expressed in the <hi>Order</hi> (as the Charge it self lays it down) for the disposal of the Books <hi>according to Law.</hi> Then the <hi>Warrant of their Commitment to the Islands,</hi> Aug. 27. 1637. This Commitment was no Device of mine; nor did I ever hear of it, till it was spoken by others in the <hi>Star-Chamber:</hi> Nor do any one of these Warrants prove any thing, that can be call'd my Act: And I humbly conceive, that I ought not by <hi>Law,</hi> nor can by Usage of <hi>Parliamentary-Proceedings,</hi> be charged single for those things which were done in Publick Courts. The last Order was, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> 12. 1637. about the <hi>Aldermen of Coventry,</hi> and the <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> resolved upon against the <hi>Charter</hi> of that City, <hi>only for supposed Favours shew'd to Mr.</hi> Pryn <hi>in his passage that way.</hi> First, 'tis confessed in the Charge, that this was an Act of the <hi>Lords.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that it was made at a full <hi>Board.</hi> Thirdly, 'tis not urged that any one Man disliked it. Fourthly, the Complaint which caused it, was, that both <hi>Aldermen</hi> and their <hi>Wives,</hi> and other <hi>Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,</hi>
                        <pb n="253" facs="tcp:54614:138"/>
were not content to shew Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> kindness; but they both did, and spake that which was disgraceful to the <hi>Star-Chamber-Sentence.</hi> But howsoever, there is no Particular in that <hi>Order,</hi> that is, or can be Charged upon me.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This for the Warrants. The next Witness concerning this Charge was <hi>Tho. Edwards.</hi> He says, <hi>That three Hampers of Mr.</hi> Pryn's <hi>Books were taken out of his House</hi> (whither it seems, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed for Safety,) <hi>and no Warrant shewed to take them.</hi> The weaker Man he, to let his Friends Books go so. But this Witness hath not one Word of me.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The next Witness, was <hi>William Wickens;</hi> he says, <hi>he knew of no Warrant neither; but that License was given by the Sheriffs about Six Years since.</hi> Here's never a Word concerning me; nor am I to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> Act. And whereas it is an Aggravation in the Charge, <hi>That all Mr.</hi> Pryn's <hi>Books were sold: Tho. Edwards</hi> says there were but Three Hampers of them; and this Witness says he bought them for Two and Thirty Pounds: And these neither by Number nor Price, could be half of Mr. <hi>Pryn's</hi> Books, if I have heard Truth of his <hi>Library.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. After this Man's Testimony comes Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> himself in his own Cause. He made a long relation of the Business, and full of Bitterness against me. This I doubt not was purposely done, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present me as Odious as he could, to <hi>the Lords</hi> and the Hearers. But I shall assume nothing to my self, that was done by Order of the <hi>Court of Star-Chamber:</hi> Whatsoever was done there by Common Consent, was their Act, not mine; and if any <hi>Treason</hi> be in it, they are as guilty as I; for Treason admits no Accessories. Nor will I meddle with the Language: God forgive him that, and what ever else he hath done against me: Only I shall answer to all such particulars of his, as seem to touch upon my self.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1) First then he says, <hi>he brought a Prohibition,</hi> An. 1629. <hi>and that was the Ground of my Hatred against him.</hi> For Prohibitions, I shall Answer when they are Charged: But as I remember not this, so I bare him no Hatred; and bearing him none, it could not be for that Cause: Nor doth he so much as offer to prove it was.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2) Next he says, <hi>I gave Direction to Mr. Attorney</hi> Noy, <hi>and that Dr.</hi> Heylin <hi>drew some Informations for him.</hi> Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Mr. <hi>Attorney;</hi> but how long, or upon what grounds I know not: Nor did I give Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> any direction. What Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> did, if he did any thing, is nothing to me, unless I set him on; which is not Proved, nor Sworn.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3) He farther says, That Mr. <hi>Attorney read his Book twice over, and said that he found nothing amiss in it.</hi> I know not what Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> said to him; nor what he may say of Mr. <hi>Attorney,</hi> now he is dead: This I am sure of, and 'tis well known to some of your Lordships, he said far otherwise in open <hi>Court.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">(4) He says, <hi>That his Book was Licensed to the Press, and after that seized, and that the Messenger told him it was done by me.</hi> This was done by Warrant of the <hi>High Commission,</hi> not by me: Nor doth he offer any Proof against me, but that the Messenger told him so; which is a bare Hearsay, and no Proof.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <pb n="254" facs="tcp:54614:139"/>
(5) Then he says, <hi>That there was another</hi> Order <hi>given about his Business, and that I did it.</hi> But he brings no Proof for this, but that Mr. <hi>Ingram,</hi> the then Keeper of <hi>the Fleet,</hi> told him so. But this is as bare a Hearsay as the former, and Mr. <hi>Ingram</hi> not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to make out the Proof.</p>
                     <p n="6">(6) Then he says, <hi>He writ me a Letter, and that I sent it to Mr.</hi> Attorney, <hi>to have him yet farther proceeded against.</hi> 'Tis true, <hi>my Lords,</hi> he did Write unto me; but whether it were a <hi>Letter,</hi> or a <hi>Libel,</hi> I leave other Men to Judge. This Letter I did send to Mr. <hi>Attorney;</hi> but only to let him see how I was used, not to have any farther proceeding against him. But Mr. <hi>Attorny</hi> was so moved at the sight of it, that when he saw me next, he told me he would call him <hi>Ore tenus</hi> for it. Therefore it seems, somewhat was very much amiss in it, call the Writing what you will.</p>
                     <p n="7">(7) He says, Mr. <hi>Attorney thought he had not kept the Letter; but he was deceived, for he had it.</hi> But how was Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> deceived? I'le tell <hi>your Lordships</hi> what himself told me. When Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> saw that I would not agree to any farther Prosecution, he sent for Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> shewed him <hi>the Letter,</hi> and thought after he had Read it to give him some good Counsel, to desist from that Libelling Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of his. But Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> after he had got the Letter into his Hands, went to the Window, as if he meant to read it, and while Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> was otherwise busied, he tare it into small Pieces, and threw it out at the Window, and then said unto him, <hi>This shall never rise in Judgment against me.</hi> Now he confesses he hath the Letter still, and that Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> was deceived: Belike he tare some other Paper for it, and put the Letter in his Pocket.
<q>
                           <p>But that you may see the Honesty of this Man, and what Conscience he makes of that which he speaks upon his Oath; Here he says he had the Letter still, and that Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> was deceived: And yet after this, when he sets out his <hi>Breviate</hi> of my Life; he confesses, <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>W. Pryn's</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate of the Arch-Bishop's Life. p. <hi>19.</hi>
                              </note> in an unsavoury Marginal Note, <hi>That he Tare it, Mr.</hi> Attorney <hi>having need of such a Paper.</hi> And for this <hi>Breviate</hi> of his, if God lend me Life and Strength to end this first, I shall discover to the World  the Base and Malicious Slanders with which it is fraught.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">(8) He went on, and said, <hi>There was an</hi> Order <hi>made against him when Term was done, so that he could have no Remedy.</hi> This is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly against <hi>the Court</hi> and their Order, not against me.</p>
                     <p n="9">(9) Then he cites out of <hi>the Epistle</hi> before my Speech in <hi>the Star-Chamber,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Paulò post medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</note> 
                        <hi>that I Censured him for having his Hand in the Pamphlets of those times, and yet was doubtful of it.</hi> The Words are; <hi>For I doubt his Pen is in all the Pamphlets.</hi> But first, 'tis acknowledged I gave no Vote at all in his Censure: And if I did not Judicially Censure him, then sure I was not doubtful, and yet Censured. Secondly, he was Censured upon his own Pamphlet: And his Hand was certainly in his own, what doubt soever I might make of it's being in theirs. And Thirdly, if the Words be extended to their Pamphlets also, that's nothing to prove I doubted of the Justness of the Sentence. For the Words are not, <hi>I doubt his Pen is in all those Pamphlets of Mr. Burton, and Dr. Bastwick;</hi> but <hi>in all the Pamphlets,</hi> whether their
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:54614:139"/>
Libels, or any others; so I might be doubtful of the one, and yet certain enough of the other.</p>
                     <p n="10">(10) And whereas he adds, <hi>That he was joyntly Charged with Dr.</hi> Bastwick <hi>and Mr.</hi> Burton, <hi>yet could not be suffered to speak together for a joynt Answer; and that his Cross Bill was refused.</hi> All this was done by <hi>the Court of Star-Chamber;</hi> not by me. And <hi>your Lordships</hi> know well <hi>the Lord Keeper</hi> managed the Affairs of that <hi>Court,</hi> not I.</p>
                     <p n="11">(11) Then he says, <hi>That at last, Mr.</hi> Holt <hi>came to him, but was threatned that very Afternoon for it.</hi> But he doth not tell <hi>your Lordships</hi> by whom; and for my part more than civil giving him the time of the Day, I never spake with him in all my Life.</p>
                     <p n="12">(12) He tells your Lordships next, <hi>how he passed through</hi> Coventry, (to which I have spoken already) <hi>and how through</hi> Chester, <hi>and how some</hi> Chester <hi>men were used concerning him, and his entertainment.</hi> But, <hi>my Lords,</hi> whatsoever was done in this, was by the <hi>High-Commission at York;</hi> and if any thing be therein amiss, they must answer that did it.</p>
                     <p n="13">(13) Lastly, he spake of <hi>sending Sir</hi> William Balfore <hi>to me, and some other like Particulars.</hi> Of all which there is no Proof, but a bare Relation, what Mr. <hi>Hungerford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ingram</hi> and Sir <hi>William Balfore</hi> said; which is all Hearsay, and makes no Evidence, unless they were present to Witness what is said.
<q>
                           <p>And here give me leave to observe, that Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> hath in this Charge woven toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all that he cou'd say concerning both Causes, for which he was Censured: For in the third Particular he speaks of <hi>his Book,</hi> for which he was first Censured; and in the Ninth and Tenth of  his <hi>Cross-Bill,</hi> and the like, which were in his second Cause.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. The sixth Witness was Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> a Party too. For that which he said agreeable to Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> it received the same Answer. And he added nothing new, <hi>but that his Wife was kept from him by Warrant from the Lords:</hi> And if it was by <hi>the Lords Order,</hi> then was it not by me. And when it was replyed, that till he was Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to <hi>Garnsey,</hi> his Wife had access to him: Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> answered, Yea; <hi>but,</hi> my Lords, <hi>she was not suffered to be with me at Nights.</hi> At which the Lords fell a Laughing, and there ended his Charge.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The last Witness was Mrs. <hi>Bastwick:</hi> And she also said nothing different from Mr. <hi>Pryn;</hi> but that she was kept from her Husband, and that she Petitioned the Lords about it: But of me in particular, not one Word.
<q>
                           <p>And though Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> in his last Reply upon me, said, The Time of these Mens Censure was the noted Time of the Oppression of the Subjects Liberty; yet I shall crave leave to say of these Men, as S. <hi>Augustin</hi> once said of two great <hi>Donatists</hi> in his time, who (it seems) had received some Sentence, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a return, not altogether unlike these Men: (They were <hi>Felicianus</hi> and <hi>Pretextatus;</hi>) of those thus S. <hi>Augustin, If these Men were</hi>

                              <hi>Innocent, why were they so Condemned? And if they were Guilty, why were they with such Honour returned, and received?</hi> This applies it self. And here I am willing to put the Reader in Mind too, that Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> drawing up an exact Summ of my Charge, and pressing it hard against me, to my Remembrance (and I think my Notes could
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:54614:140"/>
not have slipped it) passed by this Charge concerning Mr. <hi>Pryn;</hi>  and I cannot but think, he had some Reason for it.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This tedious Charge being over, the World ran round, and <note place="margin">XI.</note> I was brought back again to another Charge about demolishing the Houses at St: <hi>Pauls;</hi> and here three Witnesses more came against me.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The first was Mr. <hi>Bently.</hi> He said, <hi>there were above Sixty Houses pulled down.</hi> I Answered, I know not the number; but if there were so many, the Recompence given was sufficient for more. He said farther, <hi>That there was Twenty Yards between the Church and some of the Houses.</hi> There were very few, if any such (let him look to his Oath;) but then some were close upon the Wall of the Church. And suppose all had been Twenty Yards distant; that was not room enough to bring in, and Lodge Materials for the Repair, and to turn the Carriages. And here again I made mention of my <hi>Salvo,</hi> before desired, for the <hi>Record of Ed.</hi> 3. touching the like Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and their Demolition.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The second Witness was Mr. <hi>Goare.</hi> For the Sixty Houses as was before testified; I gave the same Answer; as also, that the Act of the <hi>Council-Table</hi> cannot be said to be my Act. For St. <hi>Gregory's</hi> Church, they were not left without a Place for Divine Service, (as he would fain have it thought:) For they were assigned to a part of <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> till another Church might be built for them. And for the pulling down of St. <hi>Gregory's,</hi> 'tis well known to divers of that Parish, that I was not so much as one of the <hi>Referees,</hi> to whose view and consideration it was referred. But the Truth is, this Man Rented the Parsonage-House, and had a good Penniworth of it to gain by his Under-Tenant. The going down of that House trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles him, and not the Church.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Third Witness, <hi>Walter Biggs,</hi> says nothing different from the two former; <hi>but that I said I was opposed for the pulling down of the Houses.</hi> Whence it was inferred, that it was my Act; because I was opposed. But, <hi>my Lords,</hi> I hope I might say [<hi>I was Opposed</hi>] without any Offence, or without taking the Order of the <hi>Council-Table</hi> to my self: For 'tis well known, the Work of that Repair, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God, was mine; and I took no indirect, no oppressing Way to it; nor can I now be ashamed of that, which in future times, in despight of the present Malice, will be my Honour. So that the Care of the Work lying upon me, I might well say <hi>I was opposed,</hi> though the Opposition went higher, against the Orders of <hi>the Lords.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The last Charge of this Day, was about the putting down of two <note place="margin">XII.</note> Brewers in <hi>Westminster,</hi> because the Excessive and Noysom Smoak from thence much annoyed the <hi>King's</hi> House, Gardens and Park at St. <hi>James.</hi> These two were Mr: <hi>Bond,</hi> and Mr: <hi>Arnold.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. For Mr. <hi>Bond,</hi> he begins with somewhat that I should say at the <hi>Council-Table:</hi> As Namely, that <hi>he must Seal a Bond of two Thousand Pounds, to Brew no more with Sea-Coal.</hi> Now this argues, if I did so speak, that it was in delivering to him the Sense of the <hi>Board;</hi> which Office (as I have before expressed, and is well known) was usually put upon me, if I were present. And <hi>your Lordships</hi> may here again see, what En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy hath followed me upon that, which I could not decline. He says farther, that upon this Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> Banks <hi>proceeded against him in</hi>
                        <pb n="257" facs="tcp:54614:140"/>
                        <hi>the Exchequer;</hi> That there, upon some occasion, <hi>the Lord Chief Baron should say, ye are wise Witnesses for the King;</hi> That <hi>his Councel were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to Plead; and so a Verdict passed for the King.</hi> All this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to me; I was neither Chief Baron nor Witness, nor one of the <hi>Jury</hi> that gave the <hi>Verdict.</hi> He says, he was informed, <hi>that there was an Order of</hi> Council <hi>made, that no Man should put up a Petition for him.</hi> But himself doth not so much as mention, that this Order was procured by me: And it is but a Report that no Petition might be delivered for him; and none of them that told him so, produced for proof: So he scandalizes the <hi>Lords</hi> by Hearsay.</p>
                     <p>Next he says, <hi>that the King graciously sent him with a Reference to the</hi> Council <hi>for satisfaction.</hi> First, I must believe, if he were so sent, the Wrong being only the <hi>Kings,</hi> and he willing he should have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction however for his Loss;
<q>
                           <p>that the <hi>Lords</hi> would never refuse in such a Case, whatsoever is here said to the contrary. Secondly, it may be observed, how Gracious the <hi>King</hi> was to the Subject; that though the Annoyance was great to that House of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation and retiring near the City; yet he would not have Mr. <hi>Bond</hi> suffer without satisfaction: Notwithstanding which Goodness of the <hi>King,</hi> he comes into this great <hi>Court;</hi> and so he may have a Blow at me, blasts (as much in him lies) all the <hi>King's</hi> Proceedings,  under the Name of Oppression, and that in a high degree.</p>
                        </q>
He says also, <hi>That a Friend of his perswaded him to come to me, and offer me somewhat to St.</hi> Pauls; <hi>and that he did come to me accordingly, and that I said I must have of him a Thousand Pounds to St.</hi> Pauls; <hi>That he was not unwilling to give it, because his Brewing was worth twice as much to him. My Lords,</hi> I humbly desire <hi>your Lordships</hi> to consider this part of the Charge well. First, what Friend of his this was, that came so to him, he says not, nor do I know, and so have no possibility to Examine. Secondly, he says, not that I sent this Friend of his to him, thus to advise him; and then his coming no way concerns me. Thirdly, when he was come upon this Friend's perswasion, if he were willing to give a Thousand Pounds to St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> in regard of his double gain from his Brew-House, as himself confesses; I do not see (under Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour) what Crime or Oppression is in it. Lastly, I remember none of this, and let him well weigh his Oath with himself: For I cannot call to mind one Penny that he gave to St. <hi>Pauls:</hi> Nor yet shall I ever think it a Sin, to take a Thousand Pounds to such a work, from any Rich and Able Man that shall voluntarily offer it; especially upon hope of gaining twice as much.</p>
                     <p>To make this Charge the heavier, He says, <hi>I sent him to the</hi> Queen-Mother, <hi>who lay then at St.</hi> James's; <hi>and that there he was laboured by some about her to change his Religion, and then he should have all Favour.</hi> This is a bold Oath; let him look to it, for I sent him not. It may be I might tell him, that if the <hi>Queen Mother</hi> were offended with the Annoyance from his House, it would not be in my power to help him; which was true. And that about his Religion, was added, to make <hi>your Lordships</hi> think, that I sent him thither for that purpose: But God be thanked, this Witness says not any one word tending that way. And for the <hi>Queen Mother,</hi> since she is thus mentioned, I shall
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:54614:141"/>
crave leave to say two things: The one, that I did both in open <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> and privately, oppose her coming into <hi>England,</hi> with all the strength I had; though little to my own ease, as I after found: The other, that after she was come, the <hi>Lords of the Council</hi> went in a Body to do their Duty to her: That time I could not but go; but never either before or after was I with her.</p>
                     <p>Then he concludes, <hi>that there was a</hi> Capias <hi>out for him, and that he was fain to make an Escape by Night, which he did to Alderman</hi> Pennington, <hi>who very Nobly Succoured him privately in his House.</hi> All which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns me nothing.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The other Witness is Mr. <hi>Arnold;</hi> who told as long a Tale as this, to as little purpose. He speaks of <hi>three Brew-Houses in</hi> Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, <hi>all to be put down, or not brew with Sea-Coal; That Secretary</hi> Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debanck <hi>gave the Order.</hi> Thus far it concerns not me. <hi>He added, that I told him they burnt Sea-Coal:</hi> I said indeed, I was informed they did; and that I hope was no Offence. He says, <hi>that upon Sir</hi> John Banks <hi>his new Information, four Lords were appointed to view the Brew-Houses, and what they burnt.</hi> But I was none of the four, nor did I make any Report, for or against. He says, Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> Banks <hi>came one day over to him, and told him that his House annoyed</hi> Lambeth, <hi>and that I sent him over.</hi> The Truth is this; Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> came one-day over to Dine with me at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and walking in the Garden before Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, we were very sufficiently annoyed from a Brew-House; the Wind bringing over so much Smoak, as made us leave the place. Upon this Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> asked me, why I would not shew my self more against those <hi>Brew-Houses,</hi> being more annoyed by them than any other? I replyed, I would never be a means to undo any Man, or put him from his Trade, to free my self from Smoak. And this Witness doth after confess, that I said the same words to himself. Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> at our parting said, he would call in at the Brew-House: I left him to do as he pleased, but sent him not: And I humbly desire Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> may be Examined of the Truth of this.</p>
                     <p>He farther says, that he came over to me to <hi>Lambeth, and confesses the words before mentioned; and that he offer'd me Ten Pound Yearly to St.</hi> Pauls, <hi>and that I said he might give Twenty.</hi> He says, that <hi>I sent him to Mr.</hi> Attorney; <hi>but withal told him, that if he found not such fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour as I wished him, it was a sign he had more powerful Adversaries than my Friendship could take off.</hi> In all this I cannot see what Fault I have committed. And I foretold him Truth: For though the Business were after referred to Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> and my self, (as himself says;) yet we were not able to end it. Then he says, <hi>I would not suffer Sir</hi> Edw. Powell, <hi>Master of the Requests, to deliver his Petition to the King.</hi> But first, this is but Sir <hi>Edw. Powell's</hi> Report, and so no Proof, unless he were produced to justifie it. Secondly, the World knows I had no power in Sir <hi>Edward:</hi> He would then willingly have delivered Petition, or any thing else, that he thought might hurt me: And the Cause is known.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lastly, He says, Mr.</hi> Attorney sent out a <hi>Capias</hi> for him; that the Sheriff came by force to take him, and what hard shift he made to escape: That after upon his Petition, the <hi>Lords</hi> gave him six Months time to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide himself elsewhere; and that he was fain to give Five-Hundred-Pound-Bond
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:54614:141"/>
                        <hi>not to Brew there.</hi> To all this I then said, and say still: First, here's no one thing Charged upon me in particular. Secondly, here's not a word of my Advice or Endeavour to set on Mr. <hi>Attorney,</hi> or to move the <hi>Lords</hi> to any thing against him. And whereas it hath been urged, that my Power was such, that I sway'd the <hi>Lords</hi> to go my way: This cannot be said, without laying an Imputation upon the <hi>Lords,</hi> as if they could so easily be over-wrought by any one Man, and that against Law; which is a most unworthy Aspersion upon Men of Honour. And if all this were true, it is but <hi>Treason against a Brew-House.</hi> Nor yet may this be called slighting of any Evidence, which is but to Answer home in my own just Defence.
<q>
                           <p>And out of this I gave my Answer to Mr. <hi>Brown's</hi> summary Charge against me in  the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> for that which concerned these two Brewers.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And here, before I close this day, give me leave, I beseech <hi>your Lordships,</hi> to observe two things. First, that here have been thirteen Witnesses at least produced in their own Cause. Secondly, that whereas here have been so many things urged this day about the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> and <hi>the Council-Table;</hi> the Act made this <hi>Parliament,</hi> for the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of the one, and the taking away of the other, takes no notice of any thing past; and yet Acts past (and those Joynt-Acts of the <hi>Council,</hi> and not mine) are urged as Treasonable, or conducing to Treason, against me. Nay, the <hi>Act is</hi> so far from looking back, or making such Offences <hi>Treason,</hi> as that if any offend in future, and that several times, yet the <hi>Act</hi> makes it but <hi>Misdemeanour,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes Punishments accordingly.</p>

                     <head>CAP. XXVI. <hi>The Fifth Day of my Hearing.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE first Charge of this Day was concerning the Indictment <note place="margin">I.</note> of Mr: <hi>Newcommin,</hi> a Minister at <hi>Colchester,</hi> for refusing to <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mar.</hi> 22. 1643. <hi>Friday.</hi>
                        </note> Administer the Sacrament, but at the Rails; and the Prosecution, which followed against <hi>Burrowes</hi> for this. The two Witnesses of the <note place="margin">Die Quinto.</note> Particulars, are <hi>Burrowes</hi> and Mr. <hi>Aske.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Testimony which <hi>Burrowes</hi> gave, was; <hi>That Mr.</hi> New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commin <hi>would not Administer the Communion, but at the Rail; That he Indicted him for receiving it there; That the Foreman threw it out,</hi> &amp;c. If Mr. <hi>Newcommin</hi> did this, Complaint might have been made of him; but howsoever here's no one word of any Command from me. And it seems the Factious Malice of <hi>Burrowes</hi> was seen, that the Foreman at first threw away the <hi>Indictment.</hi> He says, <hi>that upon this he was called into the High Commission; A Warrant from me; His House beset;</hi> Stockdall <hi>left the Warrant with the Mayor; A</hi> Habeas Corpus <hi>not obeyed.</hi> The Warrant, by which he was detained, was from the <hi>High Commission,</hi> not from me: And himself says, there were six or seven Hands to the Warrant. But then he says, <hi>my Hand alone was to another Warrant;</hi> which is impossible, for there must be three Hands at the least, or no Warrant can issue out: And all his Proof of this latter is, that he saw my Hand; which I hope he may do, though other Hands besides mine were to it. <hi>For the</hi> Habeas Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, <hi>if the Mayor said</hi> (for so <hi>Burrowes</hi> adds) <hi>he would obey my Warrant, rather than the King's Writ, because it came first;</hi> he was extreamly ill advised: But if a <hi>Mayor</hi> of a Town give an undiscreet, or a worse Answer, I hope that shall not be imputed to me. And if there be any thing in this Business, why is not <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> the Messenger produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that knows those Proceedings? Lastly, he speaks <hi>of a Letter sent to Judge</hi> Crawlye, <hi>and shew'd to Judge</hi> Hutton. But first, he says not, that <hi>Letter</hi> was sent by me, or by my means. Secondly, he names not the Contents of the <hi>Letter;</hi> without which, no Man can tell, whether it Charge any thing upon me or not. And until the <hi>Letter</hi> be produced, or sufficiently witnessed, (neither of which is offer'd) 'tis but like a written Hearsay. And I humbly pray you to observe from himself, that the two Reverend <hi>Judges</hi> looking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Business, said, it was a meer Cheat for Money, and returned him back to <hi>Colchester:</hi> Which is a Proof too, that the <hi>Habeas Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> was obeyed; for if he were not brought up before them, how could he be returned by them?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Then Mr. <hi>Aske,</hi> the second Witness, was produced. He said <hi>there came Players to Town, and that some, which said they came from me, were taken in a Tavern upon</hi> Easter-Eve <hi>at unseasonable Hours.</hi> I know not of any that were sent from me: But if any were, and kept any disorder in the Town, especially at such a time, Mr. <hi>Aske</hi>
                        <pb n="261" facs="tcp:54614:142"/>
did very well to question them. He says, that <hi>upon the Matter I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred him twice to</hi> Sir John Lambe, <hi>and that at the second time he found the Plot was to make him an instrument about the Rails, which he absolutely refused.</hi> I did refer him (and it may be twice) to <hi>Sir John Lambe;</hi> but if <hi>Sir John</hi> spake to him about the Rails, he had no Commission from me so to do.
<q>
                           <p>I understood Mr: <hi>Aske</hi> too well, to offer to make <note place="margin">Frigidius di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum. <hi>W: S: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                                       <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                                    </gap> C.</hi>
                              </note> him an instrument in such a Business. His Zeal would have set  the Rails on fire, so soon as ever he had come near them.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Next he says, <hi>that Mr.</hi> Newcommin <hi>was indicted, as is aforesaid, and that Indictment found: That Letters missive were sent for him and his Wife, by</hi> Stockdall. If Letters Missive by <hi>Stockdall,</hi> then they were sent by the <hi>High Commission,</hi> whose Joynt Act cannot be Charged upon me: And if any thing can be proved, why is not <hi>Stockdall</hi> produced? He says, <hi>that he went into</hi> Holland <hi>to avoid the Oath</hi> Ex Officio. The Oath <hi>Ex Officio</hi> was then the Common, and for ought I yet know, then the Legal Course of that Court: So I could not help the Tender of that <hi>Oath</hi> unto them, had they stayed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. But the Truth is, he was too guilty to appear; for his Wife was a Separatist, and himself confesses, that she came not to the Prayers of the Church. And as for him, I ever found him the great maintainer of all wilful opposition against the Church. He farther says, he came to me to <hi>Croyden;</hi> and <hi>that there I told him he might have put the Indictment against Mr.</hi> Newcommin <hi>in his Pocket.</hi> Indeed, <hi>my Lords,</hi> if I did say so, I think I spake it truly. For if he had born any respect to the Reputation of the Clergy, I think he might have Pocketted it for one <hi>Sessions,</hi> without any prejudice at all to the Law, or any thing else. God knows, this is often done. And if thereupon I added (as Mr. <hi>Aske</hi> says I did,) <hi>That if he were so strictly set against Church-Men in the Temporal Courts, he must look for as strict Proceedings in the High Commission;</hi> I see no great Crime in it: For we are as strictly bound to Prosecute in the one, as he was in the other. <hi>And if his Clerk</hi> (as he says) <hi>was attached, who Read the Indictment;</hi> yet it is not said by himself, that he was Attached for reading it.
<q>
                           <p>And if it were so, that some <hi>Jurors</hi> were Attached, and not Mr. <hi>Aske's</hi> Clerk only, (as Mr. <hi>Browne</hi> pressed it in the Summ of his Charge) yet the Answer comes all to one. For no Witness says, these <hi>Jurors</hi> were called into the <hi>High Commission,</hi> for being <hi>Jurors,</hi> or discharging that Legal Duty. And then I hope a Man's being of a Jury shall not excuse him <note n="*" place="margin">from.</note> for answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Crime in any Court, that hath Power to call him: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he be not called off at the time of his Service, or while he is under the Priviledge of that Court, in which he is a <hi>Juror.</hi> And according to this I gave Mr. <hi>Browne</hi> my Answer. And howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the Attachment goes of Course out from the <hi>Commission,</hi> and  not from me.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second Charge of this Day was about the Censure which fell <note place="margin">II.</note> on the Inhabitants of <hi>Beckington</hi> in <hi>Sommersetshire,</hi> about their refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to remove the Communion-Table according to the Order of their <hi>Diocesan:</hi> About which were produced three Witnesses, to whose Evidence I shall Answer in order.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="262" facs="tcp:54614:143"/>
1. The first was <hi>William Longe,</hi> who says he was Foreman of the <hi>Jury,</hi> when these Men were Indicted for a Riot; and that <hi>as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, the Parson spake with the Judge about it, which caused a sudden Verdict.</hi> The Parson of the Place spake with the Judge, and <hi>he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives</hi> that produced a sudden Verdict: First, he doth but conceive so, and that can make no Proof. If it did make Proof, 'tis only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Parson, not against me. And if the Parson speaking of it, did say, (as Mr. <hi>Longe</hi> affirms he did) <hi>That this Riot was like a</hi> Waldensian, <hi>or</hi> Swisserland <hi>Commotion;</hi> He must answer for his own Distempered Language; me it cannot concern.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The second Witness was <hi>George Longe.</hi> He says, <hi>The Bishop of</hi> Bath <hi>Commanded the Communion-Table to be removed, and set at the upper end of the Chancel; that the Church-Wardens refusing, were Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated:</hi> But he says withal, that they Appealed to <hi>the Arches,</hi> and had remedy. Then he adds farther, <hi>that the Bishop proceeded again, but the Church-Wardens would not remove it, saying it was an Innovation, and against Law.</hi> But, <hi>my Lords,</hi> 'tis neither: And therefore these Church-Wardens were in a great Contempt against their <hi>Bishop,</hi> to the ill Example of all that Country. And that it is no <hi>Innovation against Law,</hi> appears by the <hi>Injunctions</hi> of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> where it is Commanded Expresly to be set there. The Words are: <hi>The Holy</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Injunct. of Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi>

                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        <hi>Table in every Church</hi> (not Cathedrals only) <hi>shall be decently made, and set in the place where the Altar stood.</hi> Now all Men know, that with us in <hi>England</hi> the Altar stood <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> at the upper end of the Chancel: And to set it <hi>East,</hi> and <hi>West,</hi> had been cross the place where the Altar stood, and not in it. And this being <hi>Law</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> cannot now be an <hi>Innovation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When they came to me again (as they say they did) if I then told them, <hi>they deserved to be laid by the Heels for the Contempt of their Bishop;</hi> under Favour, <hi>my Lords,</hi> I spake Truth. And give me leave, I beseech you, to tell you this: It began to be a General Complaint, not of the Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> only, but of other Bishops al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that they could do little or no Service in their several Countries, by reason of the <hi>Inhibitions</hi> which issued out of my <hi>Courts</hi> to stay their Proceedings. And I wanted no good Friends in <hi>Court</hi> to tell <hi>the King</hi> as much, when any thing was complained of. By this I was brought into great straights: Deny Appeals I might not: Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent granting in my <hi>Courts</hi> destroyed in a manner the Bishops Jurisdictions. In this difficulty, seeing the wilfulness of these Men, and knowing they had received full benefit by their Appeal once already in the same Case; I did refuse to hear any more of it (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less there were new Matter;) but yet left them free to Appeal to the <hi>Delegats.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For Mr. <hi>Hughes,</hi> the Parson there, <hi>if he gave ill Words, or laid vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Hands on any of his Neighbours,</hi> it concerns not me: Let him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for what he hath said, or done. 'Tis farther said, That <hi>Mr.</hi> Hughes <hi>was with me at</hi> Windsor, <hi>and had Letters from me to the Lord Chief Justice</hi> Finch. But this Witness delivers not this upon his own knowledge; I sent no Letter by him, nor did he see me send by any other: So this is meerly a <hi>Report,</hi> and he doth not so much as tell from whom. Yea, but then he says, <hi>that Mr.</hi> Morgan (a
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:54614:143"/>
Man inward with the Judge) <hi>told him, that the Judge told him, that the little Man had put a spoke in their Cart; and thereupon</hi> (as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives) <hi>the Petty-Jury was Changed.</hi> Here are, if <hi>your Lordships</hi> mark them, two great Proofs. The one is the Witnesses Report of Mr. <hi>Morgan's</hi> Report, that the Judge had said so of me: But why is not Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> produced to clear this? The other is not the Knowledge, but the Conceit only of the Witness: <hi>He conceives,</hi> which I am Confident cannot sway with <hi>your Lordships</hi> for a Proof.
<q>
                           <p>Besides, were Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> never so inward with that Judge, yet it follows not, that he must know all. And if that <hi>Judge</hi> did mean me (for Name me he did not,) he did me the more wrong. For I never desired any thing of any <hi>Judge,</hi> him, or other, but what was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law. Nay, I so expressed my self, as that, if by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake or misinformation I had desired any thing which was not according <hi>to Law;</hi> I humbly desired my Motion might be, as if it  had never been made.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third Witness is Mr. <hi>Jo. Ash.</hi> That which this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man says, is, <hi>That</hi> Sir John Lambe <hi>told, that the Man which came about that Business, could have no Appeal admitted without me; and that if he would be so troublesome, he should be laid by the Heels.</hi> I have given <hi>your Lordships</hi> an Account, why he could not have an Appeal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me: He had had the benefit of an Appeal before in the same Cause. And for this Witness, he delivers no knowledge of his own; but only he says, the Man imployed, related it to him: So 'tis a Relation, no Proof. He says, <hi>the Penance was injoyned them in three Churches.</hi> And truly, <hi>my Lords,</hi> their Disobedience to their Bishop was great; but if the Penance injoyned were too heavy, it was the Act of their own Bishop, not mine. Then he says, <hi>that the Lord</hi> Finch <hi>told him, another powerful Hand was upon him, intimating me.</hi> First, this is no knowledge of the Witness, but a Speech of the Lord <hi>Finch.</hi> Secondly, if the Lord <hi>Finch</hi> did say so, of a powerful Hand, he wronged me much, but himself more, to confess he could be drawn awry in Judgment. Thirdly, this Witness says not that he named me, but that he <hi>Intimated me:</hi> I pray <hi>your Lordships</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what a forward Witness this Man is, that can upon Oath deliver what is <hi>Intimated,</hi> and of whom.</p>
                     <p>He says farther, <hi>That upon Petition to</hi> Sir William Portman, <hi>for some Assistance, the Bishop of</hi> Bath <hi>laid all upon me; and that when him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self came to me at the</hi> Tower, <hi>since my Restraint, I told him the Bishop of</hi> Bath <hi>did like an Obedient Bishop to his Metropolitan.</hi> For this, <hi>my Lords,</hi> here is no Proof, that <hi>the Bishop</hi> laid this Business upon me, but <hi>Sir William Portman's</hi> Report. <hi>Sir William</hi> is a worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman; why is not he produced? Why is not the <hi>Bishop,</hi> that is said to lay all upon me, brought into the Court, that he may clear himself and me, if he said it not; or that I may make him asham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if he said it? For 'tis confessed, that in the first Business, the Church-Wardens had Remedy by their Appeal to me; but that then the Bishop began again, as the former Witness declared: Nor knew I any thing of this Business till the <hi>Appeal</hi> came. As for my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to himself, that, under Favour, is quite mistaken: For I did not say, That in this Particular, but that in his General Proceedings in
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:54614:144"/>
his Diocess, <hi>the Bishop of</hi> Bath <hi>carried himself like an Obedient Bishop to his Metropolitan.</hi> Nor can my Words be drawn to mean this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: For how could I say, that in this Particular he carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self like <hi>an Obedient Bishop to me,</hi> when after Remedy given to these Men by their first Appeal into my <hi>Court,</hi> he began with them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain upon the same Cause? Besides, <hi>my Lords,</hi> this is not the first time Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> hath mistaken me.
<q>
                           <p>Mr. <hi>Browne</hi> in summing up this Charge against me, falls twice very heavily upon this Business of <hi>Beckington.</hi> First, for the point of Religion: And there he Quoted a passage out of my Speech in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> where <hi>I do reserve the indifferency of the standing of the Communion-Table either way;</hi> and yet (saith he) they were thus heavily Sentenced for that, which I my self hold indifferent. But first, this Sentence was laid upon them by their own Bishop, not by me. Secondly, the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different the thing was, the greater was their Contumacy to diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey their Ordinary: And had it not been a thing so indifferent, and without danger of advancing <hi>Popery,</hi> would Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who banished <hi>Popery</hi> out of the Kingdom, have endured it in her own Chappel all her time? Thirdly, the heaviness of the Sentence so much complained of, was but to confess their Contumacy in three Churches of the <hi>Diocess,</hi> to Example other Men's Obedience. Secondly, for the same Point, as it contained Matter against Law,  I answered Mr. <hi>Browne,</hi> as I had before answered <hi>the Lords.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The third Charge was about certain Houses given to <hi>S. Edmunds</hi>

                        <hi>Lumbard-street,</hi> where old Mr. <hi>Pagett</hi> is Parson. The Witnesses are Two.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The first is Mr. <hi>Symms;</hi> who says, <hi>that after a Verdict, Mr.</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gett <hi>the Incumbent, upon a pretenc, that these Tenements were Church-Land, got a Reference to the Lord Bishop of</hi> London, <hi>then Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer, and my self. My Lords,</hi> we procured not the Reference: But when it was brought to us under <hi>the King's</hi> Hand, we could not refuse to sit upon it. Upon full Hearing we were satisfied, that the Cause was not rightly stated, and therefore we referred them to the Law again for another Tryal; and for Costs <hi>to the Barons of that Court.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>And this was the Answer which I gave to Mr. <hi>Browne,</hi> when he  instanced in this Case.</p>
                        </q>
He says, <hi>the Houses were given to Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Vses.</hi> But Possessions are not to be carried away for saying so. If Men may get Land from others, by saying it was given to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious Uses, they may get an easie Purchase. And Mr. <hi>Symms</hi> is here in his own Case: But whether the Houses were given to Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious Uses, or not, is the thing to be tryed in Law, and not to be Pleaded to us. He complains, <hi>that I would not hear his Petition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone:</hi> And surely, <hi>my Lords,</hi> I had no reason, since it was referred to another with me. And yet I see, though I was not in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference alone, nor would hear it alone, yet I must be alone in the Treason. And here I desired that Mr. <hi>Pagett,</hi> the Incumbent, might be heard.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The other Witness, was Mr. <hi>Barnard.</hi> He says, he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the Hearing, <hi>and that Mr.</hi> Symms <hi>said he was undone, if he must go to a new Tryal.</hi> But, <hi>my Lords,</hi> so many Men say, that by their troublesomness in Law-Suits go about to undo others. He
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:54614:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
says, <hi>that Mr.</hi> Pagett <hi>named his own Referees.</hi> If that be so, 'tis no fault of mine. He says, <hi>the Reference was made to us only to Certifie, not to make any Order in it.</hi> If this be so, here's no Proof so much as offer'd, that we did not Certifie, as we were required; and then had Power given to order it, which we did. And he confesses <hi>the Councel</hi> on both sides had full Hearing, before ought was done.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth Charge of this Day was concerning the Imprisonment <note place="margin">IV.</note> of one <hi>Grafton,</hi> an Upholster in <hi>London.</hi> The Witnesses Three. Of which,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The first is <hi>Grafton,</hi> in his own Cause; and 'tis much if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell a plausible Tale for himself. He says first, <hi>That twelve Years ago he was Committed, and Fined Fifty Pounds by other Commissioners.</hi> By others (<hi>my Lords,</hi>) therefore not by me: And an Act of the <hi>High Commission,</hi> by his own Words it appears to be. He says, <hi>He was continued in Prison by my procurement, as he verily believes.</hi> First, <hi>(as he verily believes)</hi> is no Proof. And the ground of his Belief is as weak: For he gives no reason of it, but this, <hi>That Dr.</hi> Ryves, <hi>the King's Advocate, spake with the</hi> Barons; But he doth not say about what, or from whom. He adds farther, <hi>that Mr.</hi> Ingram, <hi>Keeper of the</hi> Fleet, <hi>would not give way to his Release, notwithstanding</hi> the Barons <hi>Orders, till he heard from me.</hi> Here's no Man produced, that heard Mr. <hi>Ingram</hi> say so: Nor is Mr. <hi>Ingram</hi> himself brought to Testifie. Lastly, he says, <hi>that he then made Means in Court, and so repaired to</hi> the Barons <hi>again; but all in vain: And that Baron</hi> Trevor <hi>cryed out,</hi> O the Bishop! O the Bishop! First, here's a Confession of Means in Court made to the Judges: So belike, they may have Means made to them, so it be not by me. For the Particular, I did hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly desire, the <hi>Baron,</hi> being then present, might be asked. He was asked; he blushed and fumbled, the <hi>Lords</hi> laughed, and I could not hear what he said.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The second Witness was Mr. <hi>Lenthall:</hi> But he said nothing, but that <hi>there was an Order for</hi> Grafton's <hi>Liberty;</hi> which is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third was Mr: <hi>Rivett.</hi> He says, <hi>that Mr.</hi> Ingram <hi>said, that</hi> Grafton <hi>was a</hi> Brownist, <hi>and must be brought into</hi> the Fleet <hi>again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he did much hurt among the King's Subjects.</hi> This is a bare Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of a Speech of Mr. <hi>Ingram;</hi> it no way concerns me. And a <hi>Separatist</hi> he is from the <hi>Church of England;</hi> but whether a <hi>Brownist,</hi> or no, I cannot tell, there are so many Sects (God help us.) And much harm he hath done among weak People: For most true it is, <note place="margin">Cyril Hierosol. <hi>Cateche. 15.</hi>
                        </note> which <hi>S. Cyril</hi> observes, <gap reason="foreign">

<q>
                           <p>
                              <hi>That the Devil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares these Schismatical Separations, that so much the more easily the Enemy may be received.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </q>
As for this Man, he was in his way cunning enough; for under pretence that he suffer'd by me, he got <hi>Madam Vantlett,</hi> and other of the <hi>French,</hi> to Negotiate with the <hi>Queens Majesty</hi> in his behalf. And this I found, that sometimes, when <hi>her Majesty</hi> knew not of it, they sent to <hi>the Barons</hi> for Favour for him.
<q>
                           <p>And yet I never heard, that Baron <hi>Trevor</hi> ever cryed out, <hi>O the French! O the French!</hi> Nor can I tell what stopped his Mouth in this Cry, and opened it so wide in the other, when we
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:54614:145"/>
moved to defend our selves and our Proceedings. Where, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly desire, this Passage of the Law may be considered. In the Case of depraving <hi>the Common-Prayer Book</hi> (so much Scorned and Vilified at this Day) and for not coming to Church. The Words of the Law are; <hi>For due Execution hereof, the Queens most Excellent Majesty, the Lords Temporal, and all the Commons in this present Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">1 Eliz. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> 
                              <hi>Assembled, do in God's Name earnestly require, and Charge all the Arch-Bishops, and Bishops, and other Ordinaries, that they shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to the uttermost of their Knowledge, that the due and true Execution hereof may be had throughout their Diocesses and Charges, as they will answer before God,</hi> &amp;c. Now, if I do not this, here's an apparent Breach of the Law: And if I do it against this common and great Depraver of this <hi>Book,</hi> then the Judge, who by this Law should assist me, Cries, <hi>O the Bishop!</hi> and this Answer I gave Mr.  <hi>Browne,</hi> when he Summ'd his Charge against me.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Fifth Charge of this Day, was Mr. <hi>John Ward's</hi> Case, in a <note place="margin">V.</note> Suit about Symony in the <hi>High Commission.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He says (for he also is in his own Cause;) <hi>That upon a pretence of a Lapse by Symony, I procured a Presentation from the King to the Church of</hi> Dinnington. <hi>His Majesty</hi> trusted me with the Titles, which did accrew to him in that kind; and because <hi>Symony</hi> had been so rife, Commanded me to be careful I might not betray this Trust; and therefore the <hi>Symony</hi> being offer'd to be proved, I procured <hi>his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties</hi> Presentation for Tryal of the Title. And this I conceive was no Offence: Though this be that, which he calls, <hi>the heaviness of my Hand upon him.</hi> He farther says, <hi>That I sent to the Bishop of</hi> Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, <hi>to admit the King's Clerk, the Church being void,</hi> 7. Junij. 1638. Nor do I yet see, <hi>my Lords,</hi> what Crime it is in me, trusted especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as before, to send to the Bishop to admit, when the Church is void: Many <hi>Lay Patrons</hi> do that upon Allegation of <hi>Symony,</hi> before Proof:
<q>
                           <p>And Mr. <hi>Bland,</hi> produced as a Witness also, says, that the <hi>Lord Goring</hi> prevailed with the Lord Bishop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. And I hope, an <hi>Arch-Bishop,</hi> and trusted therein by <hi>his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi> may as lawfully write to the Ordinary for Admission of <hi>the King's</hi> Clerk, as any Lay-Lord may write against it. But Mr.  <hi>Ward</hi> says nothing to this of the Lord <hi>Goring;</hi>
                           </p>
                        </q>
but adds, That <hi>Sir John Rowse</hi> prevented this Admission by a <hi>Ne admittas, Junij.</hi> 12. And that thereupon I said, <hi>it was to no purpose for us to sit there, if after a long Tryal, and Judgment given, all might be stopped.</hi> If I did say so, I think it is a manifest Truth that I spake: For it were far better not to have <hi>Symony</hi> tryed at all in Ecclesiastical Courts, than after a long Tryal to have it called off into <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>to the double Charge and trouble of the Subject. But if the Law will have it otherwise, we cannot help that. Nor is this Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion  of mine any Violation of the Law.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then he says, a <hi>Letter was directed from the Court of the</hi> High Commission, <hi>to the Judges, to revoke the</hi> Ne admittas; <hi>and that I was forward to have the Letter sent.</hi> How forward soever I was, yet it is confessed the Letter was sent by <hi>the Court,</hi> not by me: And let the <hi>Letter</hi> be produced, it shall therein appear, that it was not to revoke the <hi>Ne Admittas,</hi> but to desire the Judges to consider,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:54614:145"/>
whether it were not fit to be revoked, considering the Church was not void till <hi>Junij</hi> 14. And it hath been usual in that Court, to Write or send some of their Body to the Temporal Judges, where they conceive there hath been a <hi>Misinformation,</hi> or a mistake in the Cause; the Judges being still free to judge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law, both for the one and the other. And here he confesses the Writ of <hi>Ne admittas</hi> was revoked by three Judges, and therefore I think Legally.</p>
                     <p>But here he hopes he hath found me in a Contradiction. <hi>For when I writ to the Bishop of</hi> Norwich, Junij 7. 1638. <hi>I there said the Church was void; whereas this Letter to the Judges says, it was not void till</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nij 14. But here is no Contradiction at all. For after the Tryal past, and the <hi>Symony</hi> proved, the Church is void to so much as the Bishop's giving of Institution; and so I writ <hi>Junij</hi> 7. But till the Sentence was pronounced in open Court, and Read, the Church was not void, as touching those Legalities, which (as I humbly conceive) do not till then take place in <hi>Westminster-Hall:</hi> And the Reading of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was not till <hi>Junij</hi> 14. However, if I were mistaken in my own private <hi>Letter</hi> to the Bishop; yet that was better thought on, in the Letter from the <hi>High Commission</hi> to the Judges. He says lastly, <hi>That upon a</hi> Quare Impedit <hi>after taken forth, it was found that the King had no Right.</hi> Why, <hi>my Lords,</hi> if different Courts judge dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently of <hi>Symony,</hi> I hope that shall not be imputed to me. In the <hi>Court,</hi> where I sate, I judged according to my Conscience, and the Law, and the Proof, as it appeared to me. And for Dr. <hi>Ryve's</hi> his Letter, which he says <hi>was sent to the Cursitor to stop the</hi> Ne admittas; Let Dr. <hi>Ryves</hi> answer it: The Witness himself confesses, that Dr. <hi>Ryves</hi> says, the Command to the <hi>Cursitor,</hi> was from the <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi> not from me.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>And here ends the Treason against Mr. <hi>Ward;</hi> and till now I did not think any could have been committed  against a Minister.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Then follow'd the Case of <hi>Ferdinando Adams</hi> his Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">VI.</note> and the Suits which followed it: As it will appear <note n="*" place="margin">by.</note> in the Witnesses following, which were four.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The first was Mr: <hi>Hen. Dade,</hi> the Commissary then, before whom the Cause began: And he confesses, <hi>He did Excommunicate</hi> Adams <hi>for not blotting out a Sentence of Scripture, which the said</hi> Adams <hi>had caused to be written upon the Church-Wall, as in many Churches Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>are written.</hi> But he tells <hi>your Lordships</hi> too, that this Sentence was, <hi>My House shall be called the House of Prayer; but ye have</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">St: Mat: <hi>21. 13.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>made it a Den of Thieves.</hi> The Commissary's Court was kept (as usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally it is) at, or toward the West-end of the Church: And just over the Court <hi>Adams</hi> had written this Sentence upon the Wall, meerly to put a scorn and a scandal (though I hope an unjust one) upon that <hi>Court.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>He was commanded to blot it out. He would not, because it was <hi>Scripture;</hi> as if a Man might not Revile and Slander, nay speak Treason too (if he will be so wicked) and all in Scripture-Phrase:  Witness that lewd Speech lately utter'd, <hi>To your Tents</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 12. 16.</note> 
                              <hi>O Israel,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        </q>
Upon this he was Excommunicated, and I cannot but think he well deserved it. For the Suit which followed against Mr. <hi>Dade</hi> in the <hi>Star-Chamber;</hi> the Motion, <hi>that Mr. Attorney</hi>
                        <pb n="268" facs="tcp:54614:146"/>
                        <hi>would leave him to the common Prosecutor, and not follow it in his own Name,</hi> himself confesses was made in open Court by Mr. <hi>Bierly,</hi> and that from me he had no Instructions at all.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The second Witness, is <hi>Adams</hi> in his own Cause. To the place of <hi>Scripture</hi> I have spoken already. And the next that he says, is, <hi>That Sir</hi> Nath. Brent, <hi>in my Visitation, commanded the setting of the Communion Table at the upper end of the Chancel; That upon his not blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out the passage of Scripture, he had an Action, and that his Solicitor was Committed by</hi> J. Jones, <hi>till he relinquished his Suit.</hi> In all this, there is not one word of any thing that I did. And for that which Sir <hi>Nath. Brent</hi> did about placing the Communion Table, 'tis <note n="*" place="margin">In the second <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                           </gap>.</note> answered before. He says also, <hi>that when he saw that he must Prosecute his Suit against Commissary</hi> Dade <hi>in his own Name, he left the Kingdom.</hi> And surely, <hi>my Lords,</hi> if he would leave the Kingdom rather than Prosecute his Cause in his own Name, 'tis more than a sign, that his Cause was not very good.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third Witness was Mr. <hi>Cockshot,</hi> one of Mr. Attorney <hi>Banks</hi> his Servants. <hi>He says, that</hi> Adams <hi>moved him, and he Mr.</hi> At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney, <hi>and that thereupon Mr.</hi> Attorney <hi>gave his Warrant against</hi> Dade. By which <hi>your Lordships</hi> may see, how active Mr. <hi>Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot</hi> was against a Church-Officer, and in so foul a Scandal. He says also, <hi>that Mr.</hi> Dade <hi>came to Mr.</hi> Attorney, <hi>and told him, that I did not think it fit, a Prosecution in such a Cause should be followed in Mr.</hi> Attorney's <hi>Name.</hi> First, 'tis true, I did not think it fit; nor did Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> himself, when upon Mr. <hi>Bierlye's</hi> Motion he fully understood it. Secondly, the Cause being so scandalous to a Church-Officer, I conceive I might so say to Mr. <hi>Dade,</hi> or any other, without offence. But then thirdly, here's not one word that I sent Mr. <hi>Dade</hi> to Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> about it: He came and used my Name, so Mr. <hi>Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot</hi> says; but not one word that I sent him. Lastly, he says, <hi>That Mr.</hi> Attorney <hi>told him, that I blamed him for the business, and that thereupon he chid this Witness, and sent him to me, and that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked him for it; but he particularly remembers not what I said.</hi> Nor truly, <hi>my Lords,</hi> do I remember any of this. But if I did blame Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> for lending his Name in such a Scandalous Cause as this, I did (as I conceive) what became me: And if he chid his Man, he did what became him: And if I rebuked Mr. <hi>Cockshot,</hi> when he was sent to me, sure he deserved it; and it seems it was with no great sharpness, that he cannot remember any thing of it.
<q>
                           <p>And so I answer'd Mr. <hi>Browne,</hi> when he instanced  in this.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. The last Witness was Mr. <hi>Pryn;</hi> who says, <hi>no Appeal was left him.</hi> But that, under Favour, cannot be: For if my <hi>Courts</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused him (which is more than I know,) he might have Appealed to the <hi>Delegats.</hi> He says, <hi>That he advised</hi> Adams <hi>to an Action of the Case; that he blamed</hi> Lechford <hi>for deserting the Suit; and that he advised him to go to Mr. Attorney.</hi> So here's no assistance wanting to <hi>Adams,</hi> but the Church-Officer Mr. <hi>Dade</hi> must have none. Yet I blame not Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> because he says he did it as his <hi>Councel.</hi> He says farther, <hi>That when</hi> Adams <hi>was put to prefer his Bill in his owne</hi>
                        <pb n="269" facs="tcp:54614:146"/>
                        <hi>Name, that then the Excommunication was pleaded in Bar:</hi> But he doth not say it was pleaded by me, or my Advice; nor do I hear him say, it was unjustly pleaded. And had not <hi>Adams</hi> been wilful, he might have taken off the Excommunication, and then proceeded as it had pleased him.</p>
                     <p>Then the Charge went on against me, about the stop of Mr. <hi>Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shawe</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">VII.</note> the Reader of <hi>the Middle-Temple.</hi> The Witnesses are two Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, which accompanied Mr. <hi>Bagshawe</hi> to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> Mr. <hi>White</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pepys.</hi> They say, that Mr. <hi>Bagshawe insisted upon these two points: First, that a Parliament might be held without Bishops; and Secondly, that Bishops might not meddle in Civil affairs. My Lords,</hi> these things are now setled by an <hi>Act of this Parliament;</hi> but then they were not. And I conceive, under Favour, that Mr. <hi>Bagshawe</hi> (the Crasiness of these Times considered) might have bestowed his time better upon some other Argument: And sure, no Man can think that either my self, or any Church-Governour, could approve his Judgment in that Particular. And whereas they say, <hi>that the Lord Keeper</hi> Finch, <hi>and the Lord</hi> Privy Seal <hi>told them, that I was the Man that complained of it to</hi> the King <hi>and</hi> the Lords. 'Tis most true I did so; and I think I had been much to blame if I had not done it. And if when they came over to <hi>Lambeth</hi> about it, they heard me tell Mr. <hi>Bagshawe</hi> (as they also say they did) <hi>that he should answer it in the</hi> High-Commission Court next <hi>Term;</hi> I humbly conceive this no great Offence; but out of all Question no Treason, to threaten <hi>the High-Commission</hi> to a <hi>Reader</hi> of the Inns of Court.</p>
                     <p>The last Charge of this Day was concerning the Lord Chief <note place="margin">VIII.</note> Justice <hi>Richardson,</hi> and what he suffered for putting down Wakes and other disorderly Meetings, in <hi>Sommersetshire,</hi> at the Assises there holden.</p>
                     <p>The single Witness to this is <hi>Edward Richardson,</hi> (a Kinsman of <hi>the Judges,</hi> as I suppose.) He says, <hi>That Complaints were made to</hi> the Judge <hi>of Wakes and Feasts of Dedication; that</hi> his Majesty <hi>writ Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters about it to Sir</hi> Robert Philips, <hi>and others: They Certify a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand comes by</hi> the Lord Keeper <hi>to revoke the Order next Assises. First, 'tis not done. Then by Command from the Lords of</hi> the Council, <hi>the Judge upon that second Command revokes it; but as 'tis Certified, not fitly.</hi> In all this here's not one Word that concerns me. Then he says, <hi>That upon this last Certificate, the business was referred to the</hi> Lord Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal <hi>and my self, and the Judge put from that Circuit.</hi> I cannot now remember, what Report we made: But what e're it was, the <hi>Lord Marshal</hi> agreed to it as well as I. Then a <hi>Letter</hi> of mine was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced of <hi>Octob.</hi> 4. 1633. But the Letter being openly read, nothing was found amiss in it. And, under <hi>your Lordships</hi> Favour, I am still of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that there is no Reason <hi>the Feasts</hi> should be taken away for some Abuses in them; and those such as every <hi>Justice of Peace</hi> is able by Law to remedy, if he will do his Duty.
<q>
                           <p>Else by this kind of proceeding, we may go back to the old Cure, and Remedy Drunkenness by rooting out all the Vines; the Wine of whose  Fruit causes it.</p>
                        </q>
As for <hi>the Pretences,</hi> which this Witness spake of; they were none of mine, as appears Evidently by <hi>the Letter</hi> it self.</p>

                        <pb n="270" facs="tcp:54614:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>
As an Appendix to these, was added a Letter of my Secretary Mr. <hi>Dell,</hi> to Sir <hi>John Bridgman,</hi> Chief Justice of <hi>Chester,</hi> in a Cause of one <note place="margin">XI.</note> 
                        <hi>Ed. Morris.</hi> It was (as I think it appears) upon an Incroachment made in the <hi>Marches Court</hi> upon the Church: In which Case I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by my Place I may write to any Judge for Information: And there is nothing Peremptory in the Letter. The Words are (<hi>If things be rightly suggested.</hi>) But howsoever, the Letter is <hi>Dell's;</hi> and if he have done amiss in it, he is here present to Answer. And it will be a hard business with Men of Honour, if, when any Lord shall Command his Secretary to Write, and give him Directions for the Matter, he shall afterwards be answerable for every slip of his Secretary's Pen; especially in so high a way, as 'tis Charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on me. But the best is, here's nothing amiss, that I know.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THE First Charge of this Day concerned the Censure, Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation <note place="margin">I.</note> and Imprisonment of Mr: <hi>Huntly.</hi> The Witnesses pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced <note place="margin">Thursday, Mar. <hi>28. 1644.</hi>
                        </note> are Four.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Mr. <hi>Merifield</hi> comes on first. He says, <hi>That himself was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Die Sexto.</note> 
                        <hi>by the Lords of the</hi> Council; <hi>and that there I said, that he the said</hi> Merifield <hi>deserved to be laid by the Heels, and to be called into the Star-Chamber.</hi> This Man was (as I take it) Mr: <hi>Huntly's</hi> Attorney; and if I did speak those Words concerning him, surely his Words and Carriage deserved it: Else I am confident the Lords would not have Committed him for a naked, and an orderly following of his Clyent's Cause; especially in the presence of two Judges, Justice <hi>Jones,</hi> and Justice <hi>Crook;</hi> who he says himself were present.
<q>
                           <p>And this Answer I gave Mr: <hi>Brown;</hi> who in the Sum of his Charge against me omitted not this Case of Mr: <hi>Merifield,</hi> for so  was this <hi>Attorney's</hi> Name.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The next Witness is Mr: <hi>Huntly</hi> himself. He says, <hi>That I said unto him, that he being an Ecclesiastical Person, and in an Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Cause, ought not to decline the Church-Censure: Then followed his Imprisonment, and his Action for false Imprisonment, and the rest of his proceedings.</hi> In all which the <hi>High-Commission</hi> proceeded against him, and he proceeded against the <hi>High-Commissioners;</hi> nothing done by me, or against me, in particular. So nothing of this Charge falls upon me, but the Words; and for them, they are very far from offering to <note n="*" place="margin">Exclude from the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</note> Exempt any Clergyman, him or other, from the Temporal Laws, it things cognizable by them. But I humbly conceive, his Oath of <hi>Canonical Obedience</hi> considered, that he ought not to decline the Ecclesiastical Judicature, in things meerly Ecclesiastical. And if in
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:54614:147"/>
this my Judgment I do Err, yet it is Error without Crime: And surely, <hi>my Lords,</hi> no <hi>Treason.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Third Witness is <hi>John Dillingham.</hi> He says, <hi>That</hi> Mr: Huntly <hi>moved before the Lord Chief Justice</hi> Richardson, <hi>and that the Judge replyed, By his Faith he durst not do him Justice.</hi> To this, <hi>my Lords,</hi> I answer: Here's never a Word, that he durst not do him Justice for fear of me; that's not said by the Witness, and ought not by Conjectures be inforced against me. But howsoever, if he spake those Words, the more shame for him. He is Dead, and I will not rake into his Grave; but if he so spake, it seems he was none of those Judges, <hi>which</hi> Jethro <hi>advised</hi> Moses <hi>to make for</hi>

                           <p>Mr: <hi>Brown,</hi> in sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up of his Charge, pressed this Speech of <hi>the Judge</hi> hard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me; which inforces me to add thus much more, That this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Fourth Witness was Mr: <hi>Pit,</hi> a sworn Officer; he says, <hi>The Order concerning Mr:</hi> Huntly <hi>was from</hi> the Council, <hi>and that there was then a full Board.</hi> So this was no single Act of mine. He says farther, <hi>That he was not simply Prohibited, but only till he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the</hi> Lord Keeper <hi>with it, or those</hi> Judges, <hi>whose</hi> Courts <hi>it concerned.</hi> And this was so Ordered (as I concelve) to remedy the tedious and troublesome Interpositions of Mr: <hi>Huntly.</hi> Where it is not unfit for me to inform <hi>your Lordships,</hi> that this Cause of Mr: <hi>Huntly's</hi> was in my Predecessor Arch-Bishop <hi>Abbot</hi> his time; I had nothing to do in it, but as any other ordinary Commissioner then present had.</p>
                     <p>And here, at the entring upon my Answers this Day, I did in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral put the Lords in mind, that nothing of late times was done, either in <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> or at <hi>Council-Table,</hi> which was not done in King <hi>James</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> Times, before I was born; and that many <hi>Parliaments</hi> have been since, and no Man accused of Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanour for things done there, much less of Treason: Nor is there any one Witness, that hath charged me, That that which I did, was <hi>to overthrow the Laws, or to introduce Arbitrary Government:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <q>
                        <p>That's only the Construction made on't at the Bar; which, as it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Proof for any such Intention, so I am confident they shall answer for it at another Bar, and for something else in these  Proceedings.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Then followed the Charge about <hi>Prohibitions:</hi> In which are many <note place="margin">II.</note> Particulars, which I shall take in Order, as the several Witnesses Charge them upon me.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The First is Mr: <hi>Pryn.</hi> He says, <hi>That</hi> An: 4: Caroli <hi>he brought a Prohibition, and that thereupon I should say, Doth the King give us Power, and then are we prohibited? Let us go and Complain.</hi> First, If this were <hi>An:</hi> 4: <hi>Caroli,</hi> it was long before the <hi>Article;</hi> so that I could neither expect the Charge, nor provide the Answer. Secondly, I humbly conceive, there's no Offence in the Words. For if a Prohibition be unjustly granted upon Misinformation or otherwise; or if we do probably conceive it is ill grounded, I hope 'tis no Sin to complain
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:54614:148"/>
of it <hi>to the King,</hi> the Fountain of Justice in both Courts. Yea; but he says farther, <hi>That I said I would lay him by the Heels that</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                        <hi>brought the next.</hi> And this Mr: <hi>Burton</hi> witnesses with him. First, if I did say so, they were but a few hasty Words: For upon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts it was not done. Next I desire your Lordships to consider what manner of Witness Mr: <hi>Burton</hi> is; who confesses here before your Lordships, that he brought the next with a purpose to tempt me: You know whose Office that is; and so Mr: <hi>Burton</hi> hath abundantly shewed himself, and proclaimed his Religion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As for Mr: <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>f.</hi> 
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> 
                        <hi>Comes;</hi> he says just the same with Mr: <hi>Pryn,</hi> and I give the same Answer.</p>
                     <p>Then about taking down of a Pew in a Church in <hi>London,</hi> (my Notes are uncertain for the Name) which Pew was set above the Communion Table; That I required to have it pulled down; That they came to me to have an Order for it; and that thereupon I should say, <hi>You desire an Order of Court, that you may have it to shew, and get a Prohibition; But I will break the Back of Prohibitions, or they shall break mine.</hi> And this is joyntly Witnessed by Mr: <hi>Pocock,</hi> and <note place="margin">4.</note> Mr: <hi>Langham:</hi> And this they say was Thirteen or Fourteen Years <note place="margin">5.</note> ago. Excellent Memories, that can punctually swear Words so long after. But, <hi>my Lords,</hi> I confess to your Lordships, I could never like, that Seats should be set above the Communion Table: If that be any Error in me, be it so. For the Words, I did not speak them of <hi>Prohibitions</hi> in general, but of such as I did conceive very Illegal; as, for ought I yet know, this must have been.
<q>
                           <p>And this was the Answer wich I gave Mr: <hi>Brown,</hi> when in Summing up  the Charge he instanced in this against me.</p>
                        </q>
To these <hi>Rouland Tomson</hi> adds new Words; <hi>That I wondered who durst grant a Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                        <hi>the High-Commission Court being above all.</hi> But he confesses, he knows not the time when this was spoken. Let him look to his Oath, for I am as Confident, he knows not the thing. And I farther believe, that neither he, nor any the rest of my Accusers think me so Ignorant, as to say, the <hi>High-Commission Court was above all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Francis Nicolas</hi> says, that <hi>about Four Years since he delivered a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, and was committed for it.</hi> To this, <hi>Quaterman</hi> comes in, and <note place="margin">8.</note> says more than <hi>Nicolas</hi> himself: For he says, <hi>he delivered it in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Stick, and was Committed for it.</hi> First, if he were Committed, it was not for bringing the <hi>Prohibition,</hi> but for his unmannerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of it; and to reach it into the Court upon a Stick to call the People to see it, was no Handsom way of Delivery. And one that brought a <hi>Prohibition</hi> (whether this Man or no, I cannot certainly say) threw it with that violent Scorn into the Court, that it bounded on the Table, and hit me on the Breast, as I sat in Court. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, his Commitment was the Act of the Court, not mine: And for <hi>Quaterman,</hi> he is an Exasperated Man against me and that Court; as hath appeared to the World many ways.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Mr: <hi>Edwards</hi> was called up next; and he says, <hi>it was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing to lay them by the Heels, which brought Prohibitions.</hi> And they were commonly brought by bold impudent Men, picked out of purpose to affront the Court. And then if the Court made their
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:54614:148"/>
Imprisonment as common as they their Rudeness, where's the Fault? And I pray mark, this is still the Act of the Court, not mine.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Mr. <hi>Welden</hi> says, That <hi>there was a Command given to lay hold of a Man, which brought a Prohibition:</hi> But more he says not. Nor did he offer to make himself Judge of the Justice of the Court in that behalf. And considering what Affronts have been put upon the Court of <hi>High Commission,</hi> by the bringers of Prohibitions, I hope it shall not be accounted a Crime to stay him that brings it, till the Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition be seen, and considered.</p>
                     <p n="11">11.
<q>
                           <p>The next Witness is Mr. <hi>Ward:</hi> And he is an angry Witness,  for his Cause before-mentioned about <hi>Symony.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </q>
That which he says is, <hi>That An.</hi> 1638, <hi>He that brought a Prohibition in a Cause of Mr.</hi> Foetroughts, <hi>was laid by the Heels:</hi> But he himself confesses, the Court then declared, that they were affronted by him: And then he was Punished for that Misdemeanour in his Carriage, not for bringing the Prohibition. He says farther, <hi>that I directed some Commissioners to attend the Judges about it, and that the Party had no benefit by his Prohibition.</hi> For my directing Attendance upon the Judges, I think I did what well became me: For there came a <hi>Rule</hi> before the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition,</hi> which required the Court so to do;
<q>
                           <p>And Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because this was not done; and now I am Accused, because I  gave direction to do it.</p>
                        </q>
And if the Party had no benefit by his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition;</hi> it must needs follow, that either the Judges were satisfied by our Information of the Cause; or, if not, that they did Mr. <hi>Foetrought</hi> the wrong, and not we.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. The last Witness about Prohibitions, was Mr. <hi>Wheeler.</hi> He says, that in a Sermon of mine long since, I used these Words: <hi>They which grant Prohibitions to the Disturbance of the Churches Right; God will prohibit their entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven: And he says he writ down the Words, that he might remember them.</hi> If this Gentleman will tell me, what <hi>Text</hi> I then Preached on, I will look upon my Sermon (if that with my other Papers be not taken from me;) and shew the place. In the mean time, with that Limitation with which he confesses I spake them, I conceive there is no fault at all in the Words. For it will be found no small fault in Judges to grant Prohibitions to the Disturbance of the Rights of the Church, which no Law of God or Man warrants them to do. So the words I spake, must needs be understood of illegal Prohibitions. For they which are Legal, do only stop the Church from doing wrong, but do no wrong to the Church by disturbing her Rights.
<q>
                           <p>Mr. <hi>Browne</hi> charged this Sermon Note upon me also, and I gave him this Answer. Nevertheless, I cannot but be sorry to hear it from Mr. <hi>Wheeler's</hi> own Mouth; that he was so careful to write this Passage, and so ready to come to witness it against me; considering how many Years I have known him, and how freely he hath often come to my Table, and been welcome to me; yet never told me, this Passage in my Sermon troubled him. It seems some Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity  or other laid it up against this wet Day.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here, having thus answered all Particulars; I humbly craved leave of their Lordships, to inform them some few things concerning <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions.</hi> As first, that there was a great Contestation about them, <note place="margin">1.</note>
                        <pb n="274" facs="tcp:54614:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>
between my Predecessor, Arch-Bishop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> and the then Judges, and this before King <hi>James</hi> and the Lords of the <hi>Council;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Atturney Hobart</hi> Pleaded for the Church against them. Sir <hi>Henry Martin</hi> gave me Copies of all those Papers on both sides. No final End made, that I could ever hear of. This calling them all in Question, was far more than ever was done by me, or in my time; and yet no Accusation at all, much less any of <hi>Treason,</hi> put up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Arch-Bishop <hi>Bancroft</hi> for this. Secondly, I have here Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers <note place="margin">2.</note> Attested of all <hi>the Prohibitions,</hi> which have been admitted in my Courts of <hi>Arches,</hi> and <hi>Audience:</hi> And I find, there are as many (if not more) admitted in my Seven Years time, as in any Seven <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sir</hi> Timothy Baldwin <hi>hath these Papers.</hi> W. S. A. C.</note> Years of my Predecessor Arch-Bishop <hi>Abbot.</hi> And these Papers I delivered into the Court. As for the <hi>High-Commission,</hi> the Records are all taken from us; else I make no doubt, but it would soon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by them, that as many have been admitted there also. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">3.</note> There is a great difference touching <hi>Prohibitions,</hi> and the send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, since the Times of Reformation, and before. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the <hi>Bishops Courts</hi> were kept under a foreign Power, and there were then weighty Reasons for <hi>Prohibitions,</hi> both in regard of <hi>the King's</hi> Power, and the Subjects Indempnity. But since the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all Power Exercised in the Spiritual Courts, is from <hi>the King,</hi> as well as the Temporal; so that now there neither is, nor can be so much Cause, as formerly was. And yet, all that I did humbly and earnestly desire, was, that some known Bounds might be set to each Court, that the Subject might not, to his great Trouble and Expence, be hurried, as now he was, from one Court to another. And here I desired a <hi>Salvo,</hi> till I might bring Arch-Bishop <hi>Parker's</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">

                        </note> Book, to shew his Judgment in this Point, in the beginning of the Reformation, if it shall be thought needful:

                     </p>
                     <p>The next Charge is about my undue taking <hi>of Gifts:</hi> A Charge, <note place="margin">III.</note> which I confess I did not think to meet here. And I must, and do humbly desire your Lordships to remember, that till this Day I have not been Accused, in the least, for doing any thing Corruptly: And if I would have had any thing to do in the base dirty Business of Bribery, I needed not have been in such Want as now I am. But my Innocency is far more to my Comfort, than any Wealth so got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten could have been. For I cannot forget that of <hi>Job,</hi> That <hi>Fire</hi>

'Tis true, I did so. But First, I desire it may be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that it was wholly in my Power, whether I would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him the Bond, or not. Secondly, That upon this gross Abuse, I might have sued the Bond in my own Name, and bestowed the Money upon what Charitable Uses I had thought fit. Thirdly, That I did nothing herein, but what the Letters-Patent for Repair of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> give me power to do.

                     <p n="2">2. The second Particular was Charged by one Mr. <hi>Stone,</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> who said, <hi>he sent into</hi> Lambeth <hi>two Butts of Sack, in a Cause of some Chester-Men, whom it was then in my Power to relieve, and mitigate their Fine set upon them in the High Commission at</hi> York, <hi>about Mr.</hi> Pryn's <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, as he passed that way: And that this Sack was sent in before my Composition with him, what should be mitigated, and so before my return of the Fine mitigated into the Exchequer.</hi> The Business, <hi>my Lords,</hi> was thus. <hi>His Majesty</hi> having taken the Repair of the West End of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> to himself, granted me to that end all the Fines in <hi>the High-Commission</hi> Court, both here, and at <hi>York,</hi> and left the Power of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation in me. The <hi>Chester-Men,</hi> which this Witness speaks of, were deeply Sentenced at <hi>York,</hi> for some Misdemeanours about Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> then lately Sentenced in the <hi>Star-Chamber.</hi> One, or more of them were Debtors to this Mr. <hi>Stone,</hi> to the value of near Three Thousand Pounds (as he said.) These Men, for fear of the Sentence, kept themselves close, and gave Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> to know, how it was with them; and that if he could not get me to moderate the Fine, they would away, and save themselves; (for they had now heard the Power was in me.) Upon this, Mr. <hi>Stone,</hi> to save his own Debt of three Thousand Pounds, sends his Son-in-Law, Mr. <hi>Wheat,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Bailie,</hi> Men that were bred in the College of S. <hi>John,</hi> under me, and had ever since good interest in me, to desire my Favour. I at first, thought this a pretence, and was willing to preserve to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> as much as fairly I might: But at last, upon their earnest pleading, that the Men were not Rich, and that Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> was like (without any fault of his) to be so much damnified; I mitigated their Fines, which were in all above a Thousand Pounds, to two Hundred. I had great Thanks of all Hands; and was told from the <hi>Chester-Men,</hi> that they heartily wished I had had the Hearing of their Cause from the beginning. While Mr. <hi>Wheat</hi> and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dr. <hi>Bailie</hi> were Soliciting me for Favour to Mr. <hi>Stone,</hi> He thinks upon sending Sack into my House, and comes to my Steward
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:54614:150"/>
about it. My Steward acquaints me with it. I gave him absolute Command not to receive it, nor any thing from any Man that had Business before me: So he refuses to admit of any. Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> presses him again, and tells him, he had no Relation to the <hi>Chester-Men's</hi> Cause; but would give it for the great Favour I had always shew'd to his Son-in-Law: But still I Commanded my Steward to receive none. When Mr: <hi>Stone</hi> saw he could not fasten it, he watches a time, when my Steward was out of Town, and my self at Court, and brings in his Sack, and tells the Yeoman of my Wine-Cellar, he had leave to lay it in. My Steward comes home; finds the Sack in the Cellar; tells me of it: I Commanded it should be taken out, and carried back. Then Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> comes; intreats he may not be so Disgraced; protests as before, that he did it meerly for my great Favour to his Son-in-Law; and that he had no Relation to the <hi>Chester-Men's</hi> Business: And so after he protested to my self, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me in a Morning, as I was going over to the <hi>Star-Chamber.</hi> Yet afterwards this <hi>Religious Professour</hi> (for so he carries himself) goes Home, and puts the Price of the Sack upon the <hi>Chester-Men's</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Hereupon they complain to the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> and <hi>Stone</hi> is their Witness.</p>
                     <p>This is the truth of this Business, as I shall answer it to God.
<q>
                           <p>And whether this do not look like a thing Plotted by the Faction  so much imbittered against me, let understanding Men judge.</p>
                        </q>
Mr. <hi>Wheat,</hi> his Son-in-Law, was present in Court, and there avowed, that he Transacted the Business with me, and that he went not out of Town, till I had agreed to the Mitigation; that in all that time there was no Tender of Sack, or any thing else unto me; and he, and Dr. <hi>Bailie,</hi> the only Men with whom I Transacted the whole Business.
<q>
                           <p>And so much could Dr. <hi>Bailie</hi> also witness, but  that (as the Times are) I could not bring him from <hi>Oxford.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </q>
With Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> himself, I never treated. For my Steward, he is dead three Years since, who could have been my Witness clean thorough the Business. And when I pressed Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> at the Bar with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, which he made to me, that he had no Relation herein to the <hi>Chester-Men;</hi> he that remembred every Circumstance else, said he remembred not that. Then I offer'd to take my voluntary Oath of the Truth of it; but that was not admitted. Then it was pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, <hi>that this Bribe must needs be before the Agreement, for he says, the Sack was sent in to my House, ......... and the Mitigation of the Fine into the Exchequer not till</hi> ...... But that is nothing: For my Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was passed, and I medled no more with it. Yea, but he says, <hi>that Mr.</hi> Holford <hi>my Servant had Forty Pound more than I agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before he would finish their Business.</hi> Mr. <hi>Holford</hi> was <hi>the King's</hi> Officer for those Returns into the <hi>Exchequer:</hi> And if, after my Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made, he either unduely delaid their Business, or Corruptly took any Money from them, he is living, and must answer for his own Fault: Me it cannot concern, who did not so much as know of it.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Wheat</hi> having thus testified in open Parliament, before the Lords, was within a Day or two called before the Committee; there re-examined in private, and very strictly, touching the time of my
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:54614:150"/>
Agreement made; Then (not without some Harshness) Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not to depart the Town, till he heard farther from them. This himself afterwards told me. Hereupon I resolved to call him again for farther Evidence, and if I saw cause, to acquaint the Lords with this usage. And I did call upon it divers times af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but one Delay or other was found, and I could never obtain it. And such a kind of calling my Witnesses to a private after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reckning, is that, which was never offer'd any Man in <hi>Parliament.</hi> And here Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> in summing up my Charge, did me a great deal of Right: For neither to the Lords, nor in the <hi>House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> did he vouchsafe so much as to name this false, base, and unworthy Charge; of which my greatest Enemies are ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit  me.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p n="3">3. The Third Particular was charged by one Mr. <hi>Delbridge;</hi> Who says, <hi>he was oppressed at the Council-Table by the Lord Keeper</hi> Finch: <hi>That he was advised by Mr.</hi> Watkins, <hi>to give my Secretary Mr.</hi> Dell <hi>Money, to get my Hand to a Petition to the Lord Keeper, who he said would not oppose me:</hi> That Dell <hi>took of him One Hundred and Fifty Pounds, and procured my Hand to his Petition.</hi> I remember nothing of this Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and it lies wholly upon my Secretary; who being my Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, is here present in Court, and desires he may answer the Scandal. There's no touch at all upon me, but that (he says) my Secretary got my Hand to his Petition to the Lord Keeper. This Petition of his was either just, or unjust. If just, I committed no Fault in setting my Hand to it: If unjust, he must confess himself a Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Man, to offer to get my Hand, to help to Boulster out his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice: And yet if the Injustice of it were Varnished over with fair Pretences, and so kept from my knowledge; the Crime is still his own, and nothing mine, but an Error at most. As for Mr. <hi>Watkins,</hi> he did me much wrong, if he sent any Man to my House on such an Errand.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Here my Secretary had leave to speak; denied the whole Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and produced Mr. <hi>Hollys,</hi> with whom it was said the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Fifty Pounds before named should be deposited; who  (to my remembrance) said, he knew of no such thing.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p n="4">4. The Fourth Instance was <hi>A Bond for the Payment of Money as a Fine: The Bond found in Sir</hi> Jo: Lamb's <hi>Chamber, with a Note upon the back of it, for One Hundred Pound received, and Sir</hi> John <hi>by my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was to call for the rest.</hi> And here it was said, that I used the Name of St: <hi>Pauls</hi> in an illegal way to get Money; which might well have been spared. For (as is aforesaid) I had a Broad Seal, which gave me all Fines in the <hi>High Commission</hi> Court, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of the West End of St: <hi>Pauls,</hi> and with Power to mitigate. And the Fines are <hi>the Kings,</hi> and he may give them by Law. The Broad Seal is in the Hands of Mr: <hi>Holford,</hi> who is thereby appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Receiver of all such Fines: But is upon Record to be seen; and if it be doubted, I humbly desire a <hi>Salvo</hi> till the Record can be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out, and shewed. But I presume these <hi>Gentlemen</hi> have seen it: And Commutations for such Crimes, as Sir <hi>James Price's</hi> was, are according to Law, and the Ancient Custom and Practice in this Kingdom; especially, where Men of Quality are the Offendors. And
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:54614:151"/>
the Power of Commuting is as Legal in that Court, as any other: And if that be doubted, I humbly desire my Councel may Argue it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Fifth Instance was a Charge concerning a Lease in <hi>Lancashire</hi> held in three Lives by Sir <hi>Ralph Ashton.</hi> 'Tis said by his Son Mr. <hi>Ashton</hi> (the only Witness in the Cause,) That <hi>I by Power at</hi> Chester, <hi>and</hi> York, <hi>and the High-Commission here, being Landlord in right of my Arch-Bishoprick, did violently wrest this Lease of the Rectory of</hi> Whally <hi>in</hi> Lancashire, <hi>out of his Hands against Law, and made him take a Lease for Years, and Pay a great Fine besides, and other Fines besides toward the Repair of St:</hi> Pauls, <hi>and raised the Rent Sixty Pound.</hi> Truly, <hi>my Lords,</hi> I am not any whit solicitous to answer this Charge. I challenged this Lease as void, and had great Reason so to do, both for the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of the Lease it self, and the unworthiness of the Tenant, both to me and my See. If in the Preparations for Tryal at Law, the Judge at <hi>Chester</hi> (altogether unknown to me, and unlaboured by me,) did say (as Mr. <hi>Ashton</hi> says he did) That <hi>for higher Powers above he durst not;</hi> he was the more unworthy. And for <hi>York,</hi> I needed no Power there; for I resolved to have him called into the <hi>High-Commission</hi> here; which was after done.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Gentleman</hi> his Son came to me about the Lease: I told him plainly, it was void in Law, and that I meant to overthrow it; That if his Father would surrender, I would renew it for Years at a reasonable rate; but if he put me to Expence in Law, I would secure my self, as well as Legally I might. He replyed, That Mr. <hi>Solicitor Littleton</hi> (for so then he was) <hi>said, he durst not be against me.</hi> And there was good Reason for it; he was my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, and Feed in that Particular. And what a poor Evasion was this? Were there no other Lawyers for him, because Mr. <hi>Solicitor</hi> was for me? The Truth is, all that ever I did in this Business, was not only with the Knowledge, but by the Advice of my Councel, which were Mr. <hi>Solicitor Littleton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Herbert.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At last this Gentleman submitted himself and the Cause; <hi>and if</hi> (as he says) <hi>Dr.</hi> Eden <hi>perswaded him to it,</hi> that's nothing to me. As for the Fine, I referred the moderation of it wholly to my Councel. They pitched upon Sixteen Hundred Pounds, and gave such Days of Payment, as that a good part is yet unpaid: And this Summ was little above one Years Rent: For the Parsonage is known to be well worth Thirteen Hundred Pound a Year, if not more. And after the Business was setled, my Lord <hi>Wimbleton</hi> came to me, and gave me great Thanks for preserving this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> being (as he said) his Kinsman, whom he confessed it was in my Power to ruin.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>the raising of the Rent Sixty Pounds;</hi> it was to add Means to the several Curats to the Chappels of Ease: And I had no Reason to suffer Sir <hi>Ralph Ashton</hi> to go away with so much Profit, and leave the Curats both upon my Conscience and my Purse. And for his Fine to St: <hi>Pauls,</hi> I gave him all the Ease I could. But since his Son will force it from me; he was accused of Adultery with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Women, and confessed all: And whither that Fine went, and by what Authority, I have already shewed. And thus much more, <hi>my Lords,</hi> at Mr. <hi>Bridgman's</hi> Intreaty, I turned this Lease into Lives
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:54614:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>
again without Fine: But since I have this Reward for it, I wish with all my Heart I had not done it. For I am confident in such a Case of Right, your Lordships would have left me to the Law, and more I wou'd not have asked. And I think this (though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated into it) was my greatest Error in the Business.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The last Instance, was about the conversion of some Money to St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> out of Administrations: <hi>By Name, Two Thousand Pounds taken out of</hi> Wimark's <hi>Estate, and Five Hundred out of Mr.</hi> Gray's. First, whatsoever was done in this kind, I have the Broad-Seal to Warrant it. And for Mr. <hi>Wimark's</hi> Estate, all was done according to Law, and all care taken for his Kindred. And if I had not stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Business; Four Men, all Strangers to his Kindred, would have made themselves by a broken Will Executors, and swept all away from the Kindred. Secondly, for Mr. <hi>Gray's</hi> Estate, after as Odious an expression of it as could be made, and as void of Truth as need to be, the Proceedings were confessed to be Orderly and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, and the Charge deserted.</p>
                     <p>Then there was a fling at Sir <hi>Charles Caesar's</hi> getting of <hi>the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stership of the Rolls for Money, and that I was his means for it:</hi> And so it was thence inferred, That I sold Places of Judicature, or helped to sell them. For this they produced a Paper under my Hand. But when they had thrown all the Dirt they could upon me, they say they did only shew what Probabilities they had for it, and what Reason they had to lay it <hi>in the end of the Fourth Original Article;</hi> and so deserted it. And well they might: For I never had more Hand in this Business, than that when he came to me about it, I told him plainly, as things then stood, that Place was not like to go without more Money, than I thought any Wise Man would give for it: Nor doth the Paper mentioned say any more, but that I informed the <hi>Lord Treasurer</hi> what had passed between us.</p>

<pb n="281" facs="tcp:54614:152"/>
Liberty and Property of the Subject; tending also to Sedition, and of dangerous Consequence. And, amongst other things, the said Arch-Bishop caused a most Dangerous and Illegal Oath to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in made and contrived; the Tenor whereof followeth in these words. <hi>That, I</hi> A. B. <hi>do Swear, that I do approve the Doctrine and Discipline, or Government Established in the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>as containing all things necessary to Salvation: And that I will not endeavour, by my self or any other, directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, to bring in any Popish Doctrine, contrary to that which is so Established: Nor will I ever give my consent to alter the Government of this Church by Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Deans, and Arch-Deacons, &amp;c. as it stands now Established, and as by right it ought to stand; nor yet ever to subject it to the Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations and Superstitions of the See of</hi> Rome. <hi>And all these things I do plainly and sincerely acknowledge and Swear, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the plain and common Sense and Understanding of the same Words, without any Equivocation or Mental Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or secret Reservation whatsoever. And this I do hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, willingly, and truly, upon the Faith of a Christian: So help me God in</hi> Jesus Christ. Which Oath the said Arch-Bishop himself did take, and caused divers other Ministers of the Church to take the same, upon pain of Suspension and Deprivation of their Livings, and other severe Penalties; and did also cause <hi>Godfrey,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> to be committed to Prison for refusing to Subscribe to the said Canons, and to take the said Oath; and afterward the said Bishop submitting himself to take the said Oath, he was set at Liberty.</p>

This made my Councel, and other Friends, to perswade me, the next time I had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance to speak, to move the Lords again for some necessary Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; notwithstanding my former Petition had been rejected. This Advice I meant to have followed that day: But after some Hours Attendance, I was sent back again unheard, and Order'd to come again on <hi>Thursday April</hi> 11.

                        <hi>which he said were against Law to sit, the Parliament being Dissolved.</hi> No, <hi>my Lords,</hi> nothing against Law that I know. For we were called to Sit in <hi>Convocation,</hi> by a different Writ from that which called us <hi>as Bishops to the Parliament.</hi> And we could not rise, till <hi>his Majesty</hi> sent us another Writ to discharge us; and this is well known to the Judges, and the other Lawyers here present: So we continued sitting, though the Parliament rose.

                     <p>Then he urged out of my <hi>Diary, at May</hi> 29. 1640. That I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged <hi>there were Seventeen Canons made, which I did hope would be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Church.</hi> 'Tis true, <hi>my Lords,</hi> I did hope so. And had I not hoped it, I would never have passed my Consent unto them. And when I writ this, there was nothing done or said against them. And if by any Inadvertency, or Humane Frailty, any thing Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous or Unfit have slipped into those <hi>Canons,</hi> I humbly beseech your Lordships to remember, it is an Article of the Church of <note place="margin">Art. <hi>21.</hi>

                        <hi>England, that General Councils may Err,</hi> and therefore this National Synod may mistake. And that since (if any Error be) it is not Wilful; it may be rectified, and in Charity passed by.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>Bishop of</hi> Gloucester's <hi>refusing to Subscribe the Canons, and take the Oath;</hi> Which is here said by the Council, but no Proof offered: The Truth is this. He first pretended (to avoid his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription) that we could not sit, the <hi>Parliament</hi> risen. He was Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in this by the Judges Hands. Then he pretended the Oath. But that which stuck in his Stomach, was <hi>the Canon about the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing</hi>

                        <hi>of the growth of Popery.</hi> For, coming over to me to <hi>Lambeth</hi> about that Business, he told me he would be torn with Wild Horses before he would Subscribe that Canon. I gave him the best Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice I could; but his Carriage was such, when he came into the <hi>Convocation,</hi> that I was forced to charge him openly with it, and he as freely acknowledged it: As there is plentiful Proof of <hi>Bishops</hi> and other Divines then present. And <hi>for his Lordship's being after put to take the Oath</hi> (which was also urged;) it was thus. I took my self bound to accquaint <hi>his Majesty</hi> with this Proceeding of my Lord of <hi>Gloucester's,</hi> and did so. But all that was after done about his Commitment first, and his Release after, when he had taken the Oath, was done openly at a full <hi>Council-Table,</hi> and <hi>his</hi>
                        <pb n="283" facs="tcp:54614:153"/>
                        <hi>Majesty</hi> present, and can no way be charged upon me, as my Act. For it was my Duty to let <hi>his Majesty</hi> know it, to prevent farther Danger then also discovered. But I am here to defend my self, not to accuse any Man else.</p>
                     <p>Next he urged, <hi>that I had Interlined the Original Copy of the Canons with my own Hand.</hi> But this is clearly a mistake, if not a wilful one. For perusing the Place, I find the Interlining is not in my Hand, but my Hand is to it; as (I humbly conceive) it was fit it should. And the Words are in the Ratification of the Canons, and therefore were necessarily to be in the Original, howsoever slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the writing of them.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>the Oath</hi> so bitterly spoken of at the Bar, and in the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; either it was made according to Law, or else we were wholly mis-led by President, and that such as was never excepted against.
<q>
                           <p>For in the Canons made in <hi>King James</hi> his Time, there was an Oath made against <note n="a" place="margin">Can. <hi>40.</hi>
                              </note> 
                              <hi>Symonie,</hi> 
                              <note n="b" place="margin">Can. <hi>118.</hi>
                              </note> and an Oath for Church-Wardens, and an Oath about <note n="c" place="margin">Can. <hi>103.</hi>
                              </note> Licences for Marriages, and an Oath for <note n="d" place="margin">Can. <hi>127.</hi>
                              </note> Judges in Ecclesiastical Courts: And some of these Oaths as dangerous as this is acounted to be. And all these established by  no other Authority than these late were.</p>
                        </q>
And yet neither those <hi>Canons</hi> nor those <hi>Oaths</hi> were ever declared Illegal by any ensuing <hi>Parliament,</hi> nor the Makers of them accused of any Crime, much less of Treason. So that we had in this <hi>Synod</hi> unblamed President for what we did, as touching our Power of doing it.</p>
                     <p>But, after all this, he said he would pass these things by (that is, when he had made them as Odious as he could) and would Charge nothing upon me but the <hi>Votes of both Houses,</hi> namely, <hi>That these Canons contain Matters contrary to the King's Prerogative, to the Fundamental Laws of the Realm, to the Rights of Parliaments, to the Propriety and Liberty of the Subject, and Matters tending to Sedition, and of dangerous Consequence.</hi> So these Votes of the Honourable Houses made so long after (and therefore cannot well be an Evidence against the making of that which was done so long before) is the Task lying now upon me to answer; which, with your Lordships ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Favour, I shall in all Humbleness Address my self unto.</p>
                     <p>Before these Words were well out of my Mouth, Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> with much earnestness interposed; That he hoped their Lordships would not indure that <hi>the Solemn Votes of both Houses</hi> should be called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Question by any <hi>Delinquent,</hi> and was sure the <hi>House of Commons</hi> would not endure it. Upon this the Lords presently gave their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, that I might not speak to any thing that was declared by Votes; but was to answer only to the Fact, whether I made the <hi>Canons</hi> or no. To this, with leave humbly asked, I replyed, That if I might not answer to the Votes, I must yield the Evidence; which I could not do: And that if I might answer, I must dispute the Votes, which their Lordships resolved I should not do: That then I was in a Perplexity, and must necessarily offend either way. And therefore humbly besought them, to consider not my Case only, but their own too. For I did conceive it would concern them in Honour, as much as me in Safety: That no Charge might be brought against me in that great Court, to which I should not be
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:54614:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>
suffered to make answer: Or else that they in Honour would not judge me for that, to which my Answer is not suffer'd to be given. With this, that all these <hi>Canons</hi> were made in open and full <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi> and are Acts of that Body, and cannot be ascribed to me, though President of that Synod, but are the Joynt Acts of the whole Body: So <hi>by me</hi> they were not made; which is my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>And according to this I framed my Answer to Mr. <hi>Brown's</hi> Summary of my Charge, both hinting the Canons in general, and concerning the Instance before given about the Bishop of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But though I was not allowed there to make any farther An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer in defence of these <hi>Canons:</hi> Nor can hold it fit to insert here so long an Answer, as these Votes require: I humbly desire the Courteous Reader, if he please, to look upon the Answer which I have made to a Speech <note n="*" place="margin">Made De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember <hi>14. 1640.</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in <hi>Rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> par. <hi>3.</hi> vol. <hi>1.</hi> p. <hi>105.</hi>
                           </note> of Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Fynes,</hi> in the House of Commons, against these <hi>Canons.</hi> In which Answer, I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, I have satisfied whatsoever these Votes contain against them. Howsoever, I cannot but observe this in present. The Words in <hi>the Sixth Original Article,</hi> are as they are above Cited: <hi>That the late Canons contain Matters contrary to the King's Prerogative, the Laws,</hi> &amp;c. But in <hi>the Ninth Additional,</hi> all the rest of the Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are in against them, but these Words about <hi>the King's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative</hi> are quite left out. I would fain know, if I could, what is the Reason of this Omission in these added Articles. Is it for Shame, because there was a purpose to Charge me (as <hi>Serjeant</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Et Art. <hi>2.</hi>

                           <hi>Wild</hi> did in his Speech the first Day) that I laboured <hi>to advance the King's Prerogative above the Law?</hi> To advance it, and yet made contrary <hi>Canons</hi> against it; which is the way to destroy it? What pretty Nonsense is this? Or is it because the framers of these Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionals (whom I conceive were some Committee, with the help of Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi>) thought the time was come, or coming, in which <hi>the King</hi> should have no more Prerogative? Or if there be a third  Reason; let them give it themselves.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>This was all concerning the <hi>Canons.</hi> Then followed the sixth Original Article about <hi>my assuming of Papal Power;</hi> where Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> in Summing up of his Charge, was pleased to say,
<q>
                           <p>
                              <hi>that no Pope claimed so much as I had done.</hi> But he was herein much mistaken. For never any Pope claimed so little. For he that claimed least, claimed it in his own right, which was none; whereas I claimed nothing but in the King's right, and by vertue of his Concession.  Between which there is a vast Latitude.</p>
                        </q>
The first Proof upon this Article, was read out of certain Letters sent unto me, by the <hi>Vniversity of Oxford,</hi> I being then their Chancellor. Which great Titles were urged to prove my <hi>assuming of Papal Power, because I did not check them in my Answers to those Letters.</hi> (1) The first Title was <hi>Sanctitas tua,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> said, was <hi>the Pope's own Title.</hi> But he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. For the Title was commonly given to other <hi>Bishops</hi> also, clean through the Primitive Church, both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>He replied in great heat (as his manner it seems is) that <hi>'tis Blasphemy to give that Title</hi> (Sanctitas) <hi>in the Abstract, to any but God.</hi> And
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:54614:154"/>
though by the Course of the Court I might not answer then to the Reply, yet now I may. And must tell Mr. <hi>Nicolas,</hi> that 'tis a great Presumption for him, a Lawyer, and no Studied Divine, to Charge <hi>Blasphemy upon all the Fathers of the Primitive Church.</hi> 'Tis given to <note n="†" place="margin">Apud Aug: Epist. <hi>88. 98.</hi>

And this is no more than an absolute <hi>Hyperbole;</hi> A high one I confess; yet as high are found in all Rhetorical Authors: And what should make that Blasphemy in an <hi>Vniversity Orator,</hi> which is every where common, and not only allowed, but commendable, I know not.

                           <p>Especially since the Rule of the Interpretation of them, is as well known as the Figure.

                        </q>
And if I had assumed any of these Titles to my self, which I am, and ever was, far from doing; yet 'tis one thing to assume Papal Title; and another to assume Papal Power (which is the thing Charged;) though I thank God I did neither.

And, as I told Mr. <hi>Browne,</hi> when he Charged this on me, Dr. <hi>Strowd</hi> the University Orator, who writ those Letters, and gave those Titles, was called up before a Committee of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,  examined about them, Acquitted, and Dismissed.</p>

                        <note place="margin">II.</note> 
                        <hi>the Clergy from the Civil Magistrate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. The first Witness is Mr. <hi>Pincen;</hi> He says, he heard me say at the High-Commission, <hi>That the Clergy were now debased; that hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was otherwise, and I hope to see it so again.</hi> Truly, <hi>my Lords,</hi> if I did say thus (which is more than I can call to Memory) I spake truth; they were debased; and I did hope to see it otherwise. For, the debasing of the Clergy will make their Office and their Doctrine base, as well as their Persons. But here is not a word of freeing them from Laws, or the Temporal Magistrate. It was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, he did mention the <hi>Civil Magistrate.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>If he did, he mentions no time, by which I might be inabled to make Counterproof. He is single. They are words, and if within the Statute, then triable by it within six Months. And I desire this grave Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to consider his Oath: For if I spake of any such Exemption; I must speak against my Conscience and Judgment, which I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thank God I use not to do. Nor is it altogether impossible for the Civil Magistrate sometimes to oppress poor Clergy-Men. But a little will be thought too much of this. And therefore to Mr. <hi>Browne's</hi> Summary Charge, I gave the former Answer, that I  spake of Exemption from Oppression, not from Law.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Second Witness was <hi>Alderman Railton,</hi> about the carrying up of the Sword in the Church, when he was <hi>Lord Mayor.</hi> He says, I once sent him word about it, but knows not by whom, and after heard no more of it, but refers himself to Mr. <hi>Marsh.</hi> He says, <hi>there was an Order of the Council-Table,</hi> May 3. 1633. <hi>concerning the submitting of the Sword in time and place of Divine Service.</hi> If an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Council, then was it no Act of mine, as I have often Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and must as often as it comes. He says farther, that I spake these Words, or to this Effect; <hi>That the Church had been low for these Hundred Years; but I hoped it would Flourish again in another Hundred.</hi> But here's no one word of Exemption from <hi>Civil Magistracy.</hi> And I hope your Lordships will take Witnesses as they speak, not as Men shall infer, and descant upon them.
<q>
                           <p>And then, my Lords,  under Favour, I see no harm in the Words.</p>
                        </q>
Only I shall recall my hope: For if I had then any hope to see it Flourish in another Hundred Years, 'tis that which I cannot hope for now. He says, <hi>there was a Reference to the Councel on both sides, and that under that Reference the Business dyed.</hi> And if it dyed then, what makes it here before the Resurrection? Yea, but says Mr. <hi>Nicolas, here's Agitation about the submitting of the Sword, which is the Emblem of Temporal Power.</hi>
                        <pb n="288" facs="tcp:54614:156"/>
But neither to <hi>Foreign,</hi> nor <hi>Home</hi> Power, but only to God; and that in the place, and at the performance of his Holy Worship. At which time and place Christian <hi>Kings</hi> submit themselves, and therefore cannot stand upon the Emblems of their Power. Nor would the <hi>Lords of the Council</hi> have made either Order or Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; had there been any thing of danger, or against Law, in this kind of submitting. Mr. <hi>Yorke</hi> was produced as another Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; but said just the same with <hi>Marsh;</hi> and so the same Answer served him.</p>
                     <p>Then followed a Charge about the <hi>Charter of York</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed; <note place="margin">III.</note> and that I did labour to have the <hi>Arch-Bishop of York</hi> his Chancellor, and some of the Residentiaries named in it to be Justices of Peace within the City. To prove this, <hi>Alderman Hoyle</hi> is produced: Who says, <hi>There was an Order of the Council about this, but cannot say that I procured it.</hi> So far then this Proof reaches not me. <hi>For the Bishop his Chancellor, and some of the Residentiaries to be Justices of Peace within the City.</hi> If I were of this Opinion (as then advised) I am sure there's no <hi>Treason</hi> in it, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no Crime. And, under your Lordships Favour, I could not but think it would have made much Peace, and done much Good in all the Cities of <hi>England</hi> where <hi>Cathedrals</hi> are. Lastly, he says, <hi>There was a Debauched Man committed about breach of the Sabbath, and being casually smother'd, I should say, they deserved to be Hanged that Killed him.</hi> Concerning this Man; he lost his Life, that's confessed. His Debauchery, what it was, is not proved. And were he never so disorderly, I am sure he was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Legal Tryal to be shut up into a House and smother'd. That is against both Law and Conscience. And the <hi>Officers</hi> then in being had reason to smother the Business, as much as they could. And, it may be, deserved somewhat; if not that which this <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> says I said, <hi>to his best Remembrance.</hi> For so, and with no more certainty he expressed it. This I am sure I said, That if the <hi>Bishop,</hi>

                        </gap> any of the Church had been then in their Charter; the Poor Man's Life had not been lost.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth Charge was just of the same Nature, concerning the <note place="margin">IV.</note> 
                        <hi>Charge of Shrewsbury.</hi> For this there were produced two Witnesses, Mr. <hi>Lee</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mackworth:</hi> But they make up but one between them. For Mr. <hi>Lee</hi> could say nothing, but what he acknowledges he heard from Mr. <hi>Mackworth.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Mackworth</hi> says first: That <hi>the Schoolmaster's Business was referred to other Lords and my self.</hi> That's no Crime; and to my knowledge, that has been a troublesom business for these Thirty Years. He says, <hi>I caused that there should go a</hi> Quo Warranto <hi>against the Town.</hi> This is but as Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> informed him, so no proof. Beside, 'tis no Crime, being a Referee, if I gave legal Reason for it. Nor is it any Crime, <hi>that the Bishop and his Chancellor should be Justices within the Town;</hi> As is aforesaid in the Case of <hi>York:</hi> Considering especially, that then many Clergy-Men bare that Office in divers Counties of <hi>England.</hi> He adds, <hi>that an Old Alderman gave Fifty Pound to St.</hi> Pauls. But out of what Consideration I know not, nor doth he speak: And if every Alderman in the Town would have given me as much to that use; I would have taken it, and
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:54614:156" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thanked them for it. Then he says, <hi>There was an Order from all the Lords Referees, for setling all things about their Charter.</hi> So, by his own Confession, the whole Business was transacted publickly, and by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of great Honour; and nothing charged upon my Particular. <hi>If Mr.</hi> Owen <hi>sent me in a Butt of Sack, and after put it upon the Town Account,</hi> (for so he also says) Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> did ill in both; but I knew of neither. And this the Councel in their Reply said they urged not in that kind. Lastly, the Charter it self was Read to both Points, <hi>of the Bishops and his Chancellors being Justices of Peace within the Town, and the not bearing up of the Sword.</hi> To both which I have answer'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. And I hope your Lordships cannot think <hi>his Majesty</hi> would have passed such a Charter: Or that his Learned Councel durst have put it to him, had this thing been such a Crime as 'tis here made.</p>
                     <p>The next Charge was out of my <hi>Diary,</hi> at <hi>March</hi> 5: 1635. The <note place="margin">V.</note> words are, William Juxon <hi>Lord Bishop of</hi> London, <hi>made Lord High Treasurer of</hi> England. <hi>No Church-Man had it since</hi> H: 7: <hi>time. I pray God bless him to carry it so, that the Church may have Honour, and the King and the State Service and Contentment by it. And now if the Church will not hold up themselves under God, I can do no more.</hi> I can see no Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in this, nor Crime neither. And though that which I did to help on this Business, was very little; yet Aim I had none in it, but the Service of the <hi>King,</hi> and the Good of the Church. And I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident it would have been both, had not such troublesom Times fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, as did.</p>
                     <p>Then they instanced in the Case of Mr. <hi>Newcomen.</hi> But that Cause <note place="margin">VI.</note> being handled before, they did only refer the Lords to their Notes: And so did I to my former Answers.</p>
                     <p>Then followed the Case of <hi>Thorn</hi> and <hi>Middleton;</hi> which were Fined <note place="margin">VII.</note> in the <hi>High Commission</hi> about some Clergy-Mens Business; <hi>Thorne</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Constable: The Witnesses in this Case are Three.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The first is <hi>Huntford</hi> (if I took his Name right:) And for the Censure of these Men, he confesses, it was in and by the <hi>High Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;</hi> and so no Act of mine (as I have often pleaded:) But then he says, that I there spake these words, <hi>That no Man of their Rank should meddle with Men in Holy Orders.</hi> First, he is in this part of the Charge single, and neither of the other Witnesses comes in to him. Secondly, I humbly desire the Proceedings of the <hi>High Commission</hi> may be seen (which are taken out of our hands.) For so far as I can remember any thing of this Cause, the Minister, Mr. <hi>Lewis,</hi> had hard measure. And perhaps thereupon I might say, <hi>that Men of their Rank should not in such sort meddle with Men in Holy Orders.</hi> But to tax the proceedings of a violent busie Constable, was not to exempt the Clergy from Civil Magistracy.</p>
                     <p>Upon this he falls just upon the same words, and says, <hi>that I utter'd them about their offering to turn out a Corrector from the Printing-House.</hi> This <hi>Corrector</hi> was a Minister, and a well deserving Man. The Trust of the Press was referred to the <hi>High-Commission Court.</hi> And I hope your Lordships will not think, that not to suffer the Printers to turn out a deserving Man at their pleasure, <hi>is to exempt the Clergy from the Civil Magistrate.</hi> The business, <hi>my Lords,</hi> was this. This <hi>Corrector</hi>
                        <pb n="290" facs="tcp:54614:157"/>
was principally entertained for the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Press especially, which I had then not without great pains and some cost Erected. They were desirous to keep only one for the <hi>English,</hi> and him at the cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est. Among them their negligence was such, as that there were found above a Thousand faults in two Editions of <hi>the Bible and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer-Book.</hi> And one which caused this search was, that in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. where they had shamefully Printed, <hi>Thou shalt commit Adultery.</hi> For this the Masters of the Printing-House were called into the <hi>High-Commission,</hi> and Censured, as they well deserved it. As for this <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector</hi> whom they would have heaved out, they never did so much as complain of him to any that had power over the Press, till this fell upon themselves for so gross an Abuse. Nor did they after this proceed against him, to make him appear faulty; and till that were done, we could not punish. And for this Business of the Press, he is single too. And I have told <hi>your Lordships</hi> that which is a known Truth.
<q>
                           <p>And <hi>Hunsford,</hi> being bit in his Credit and Purse, and Friends, by that Censure, for so gross an abuse of the Church and Religion, labours  to fasten his Fangs upon me in this way.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Second Witness is Mr. <hi>Bland.</hi> But all that he says is, that <hi>there was once a dismission of this Cause out of the Court, and that though I disliked it, yet I gave way to it, because all Parties were agreed.</hi> And no word of proof, that I was any cause of bringing it back into the Court again. What's my fault in this?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Third Witness was <hi>Thorn</hi> in his own Cause: And 'tis plain, by his own words, that this Cause was depending in Court before my time. And I believe, were the Records of the Court here, Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> would not be found so great an Offender as Mr. <hi>Thorn</hi> would make him. This I am sure of, both the <hi>High-Commission</hi> and my self have been quick enough against all Ministers which have been proved to be debauched in their Life and Conversation. And he says nothing against me, but <hi>that I sided with his Adversaries;</hi> which is easie to say against any Judge that delivers his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against any Man. But neither of these come home to <hi>Hunsford.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next Charge is in the Case of one Mr. <hi>Tomkins,</hi> about the <note place="margin">VIII.</note> Taxing of a Minister in a Case of Robbery, and Repayment by the Country.</p>
                     <p>To this Mr. <hi>Newdigate</hi> is produced; who says, as he remembers, that I should speak these words, <hi>That Ministers were free from such Taxes, and I hoped to see the Times in which they might be free again.</hi> First, this Gentleman is single. Secondly, he speaks not positively, but <hi>(as he remembers.)</hi> Thirdly, this Tax I do humbly conceive is not by Law to be laid upon any Minister. For no Man is subject to this Tax, but they which are to keep Watch and Ward; which Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters in that kind are not bound unto. And this I learned of <hi>the Lord Keeper Coventry</hi> at the Council-Table. So I might well then hope to see Ministers free from all such Taxes, by the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and due Execution of our own Laws, without assuming any <hi>Papal Power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The last Instance of this Day was the bringing of Sir <hi>Rich: Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi>

                        <pb n="291" facs="tcp:54614:157"/>
into the <hi>High-Commission,</hi> for doing his Office as Justice of the Peace upon some Clergy-Men. First, for this, this Gentleman is single, and in his own Case. Secondly, himself confesses, that <hi>his bringing into the High-Commission was long after the Fact.</hi> Therefore in all Probability not for that; nor doth he say that I caused his bringing in. He says farther, <hi>That one Article for which he was called into the Commission, was, that he was an Enemy to the Clergy.</hi> But he doth not say, that I preferred these Articles against him: Nor doth he tell, or can I remember, what the other Articles were, which with this may be bad enough to merit what was there laid against him: And whatsoever was done, appears by his own Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to be the Act of the <hi>High-Commission,</hi> or the <hi>Council-Table,</hi> and so not Chargeable upon me alone. And whereas he says, <hi>I blamed him</hi> much at the <hi>Council-Table:</hi> Let him tell why, and then I'll give him a farther Answer: And sure if I did blame him; I had just Cause so to do. Lastly, he says, <hi>I did use the Word</hi> Base <hi>to him when he came to me.</hi> Sure I cannot believe I did: It was not my Language to meaner Men. If it did slip from me, it was in Relation to his Enmity to the Clergy, not to his Person or Quality.
<q>
                           <p>And I conceive 'tis no Gentile part, for a Man of Place and Power in his Country, to oppress poor Clergy-Men which neighbour about him. In which kind this <hi>Gentleman, Pessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mè  Audiebat,</hi> heard extreamly ill.</p>

To this General I answered with another more true; That I never did attempt to bring the Temporal Power under the Clergy, nor to free the Clergy from being under it: But I do free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confess, I did labour all I could to preserve poor Clergy-Men from some Lay-Mens Oppression, which lay heavy on them.

The First Instance was in Mr. <hi>Shervil's</hi> Case; in which Mr. <hi>John Steevens</hi> tells what I said to the Councel Pleading in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">I.</note> which was, that they should take care, <hi>not to cause the Laws of the Church and the Kingdom to clash one against another.</hi> I see, <hi>my Lords,</hi> nothing that I spake was let fall, nor can I remember every Speech that passed from me; he may be happy that can. But if I did speak these Words, I know no Crime in them: It was a good Caveat to the Councel, for ought I know. For surely the Laws of Church and State in <hi>England</hi> would agree well enough together, if some did not set them at Odds. And if I did farther say, to the then <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi> (as 'tis Charged) <hi>that some Clergy-Men had sat as high as he, and might again;</hi> which I do not believe I said; yet if I did, 'tis a known Truth: For the Lord <hi>Coventry,</hi> then <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi> did imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately succeed the Lord Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> in that Office. But though I dare say, I said not thus to the <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi> whose Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration gave me no Cause to be so round with him, yet to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel at the Bar, I remember well, upon just occasion given, that I spake to this Effect; That they would forbear too much depressing of the Clergy, either in their Reputation or Maintenance; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it was not impossible that their Profession, now as high as ours once was, may fall to be as low as ours now is;

                        <p>The Second Instance was about calling some Justices of the Peace <note place="margin">II.</note> into the <hi>High-Commission,</hi> about a Sessions kept at <hi>

He says, <hi>That Sessions were kept there heretofore.</hi> And I say the more often the worse. He says, <hi>That I procured the calling of them into the High-Commission.</hi> But he proves no one of these Things, but by the Report of Sir <hi>Rob: Cook of Gloucestershire,</hi> a Party in this Cause. He says again, that <hi>They had the Bishop's License to keep Sessions there.</hi> But the Proof of this also is no more than <hi>that Sir Rob. Cook</hi> told him so: So all this hitherto is Hearsay.

And were it so, here's no Proof offered, that the Minister and Church-Wardens did give leave: And suppose some Temporal Courts might upon urgent Occasion be kept in the Church with leave, yet that is no Warrant for Sessions, where there may be Tryal for Blood. He says farther, <hi>That the Civilians quoted an Old Canon of the Pope's, and that that prevailed against the Canon of Our Church,</hi>

urged, are Law in <hi>England,</hi> where nothing is contrary to the Law of God, or the Law of the Land, or the <hi>King's</hi> Prerogative Royal: And to keep off Profanation from Churches is none of these. Besides, were all this true which is urged, the Act was the <hi>High-Commissions,</hi> not mine. Nor is there any thing in it that looks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Treason.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Second Witness is Mr. <hi>Edward Steevens.</hi> He confesses that the Sentence was given by the <hi>High-Commission,</hi> and that I had but my single Vote in it. And for the Place it self, he says, <hi>The Place where the Sessions were kept, was separated from the Isle of the Church by a Wall Breast-high;</hi> which is an evident Proof that it was formerly a Part of that Church, and continued yet under the same Roof.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Third Witness is Mr. <hi>Talboyes</hi> (who, it seems, will not be out of any thing which may seem to hurt me.) He says, <hi>The Parish held it no part of the Church.</hi> Why are not some of them examined, but this Man's Report from them admitted? <hi>They thought no harm</hi> (he says) <hi>and got a License.</hi> But why did they get a License, if their own Conscience did not prompt them that something was Irregular in that Business? He says, <hi>he was informed the Sessions had been twice kept there before.</hi> And I say, under your Lordships Favour, the oftner the worse. But why is not his <hi>Informer</hi> produced, that there might be Proof, and not Hearsay? Upon this, I said (so he concludes) <hi>That I would make a President against keeping it any more.</hi> If I did say so, the Cause deserved it; Men in this Age growing so Bold with Churches, as if Profanation of them were no Fault at all.</p>
                        <p>The Third Instance concerned Sir <hi>Tho. Dacres,</hi> a Justice of Peace in <note place="margin">III.</note> 
                           <hi>Middlesex,</hi> and his Warrant for Punishing some disorderly Drinking. The Witnesses the two Church Wardens, <hi>Colliar</hi> and <hi>Wilson;</hi> two plain Men, but of great Memories: For this Business was when I was <hi>Bishop of London;</hi> and yet they agree in every Circumstance, in every Word, though so many Years since. Well, what say they? It seems Dr. <hi>Duck,</hi> then my <hi>Chancellor, had Cited these Church-Wardens into my Court,</hi> Therefore either there was, or at least, to his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there seemed to be somwhat done in that business against the Jurisdiction of the Church. They say then, <hi>That the Court ended, Dr.</hi> Duck <hi>brought them to me.</hi> And what then? Here is a Cause, by their own confession, depending in the Ecclesiastical Court; Dr. <hi>Duck</hi> in the King's Quarters, where I cannot fetch him to Testifie; no means left me to know what the Proceedings were; and I have good cause to think, that were all the Merits of the Cause open before your Lordships, you would say, Sir <hi>Tho. Dacres</hi> did not all according to Law. But what is the Heart of this Charge? It is, say they, <hi>That I Commanded Dr.</hi> Duck <hi>to prosecute them:</hi> And what fault was in this? For if it were Just, why should not Dr. <hi>Duck</hi> go on with his Prosecution? If Dr. <hi>Duck</hi> and I were both mistaken in the Particular, 'twas easy getting a Prohibition: Yea, but they say I said, <hi>If this must be so, Sir</hi> Thomas Dacres <hi>shall be Bishop of</hi> London, <hi>and I'll be Sir</hi> Tho. Dacres. For ought I see in the Weight of it, this whole Charge was but to bring in this Speech. And truly, <hi>my Lords,</hi> my old decayed Memory is not such, as that I can recall a Speech, Thirteen or Fourteen Years since. But if I did say it, I
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:54614:159"/>
presume 'tis not High Treason for a <hi>Bishop of London</hi> to say so much of Sir <hi>Tho. Dacres.</hi>
                           <q>
                              <p>Mr. <hi>Browne,</hi> in the summing up the Charge against me, laid the weight of the Charge in this, <hi>That these Church-Wardens were Prosecuted for Executing the Warrant of a Justice of Peace, upon an Ale-House-Keeper, for Tipling on the Sabbath-Day, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Statutes</hi> Jacobi 7. &amp; Caro. 3. To which I Answer'd, That those Statutes did concern the Ale-House-Keepers only; nor were the Church-Wardens called in question for that; but because being Church Officers, and a Church-Man Tipling there, they did not complain of that to the Chancellor of the Diocess. Mr. <hi>Browne replied, there was no Clergy-Man there.</hi> I am glad I was so mistaken. But that excuseth not the Church-Wardens, who being Church Officers, should have been as ready to inform the Bishop, as to obey  the Justice of Peace.</p>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Fourth Instance was about Marriages in the Tower, which <note place="margin">IV.</note> I opposed against Law. The Witness Sir <hi>William Balfore,</hi> then <hi>Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the Tower.</hi> He says, that <hi>I did oppose those Marriages.</hi> And so say I. But I did it for the Subject of <hi>England's</hi> sake. For many of their Sons and Daughters were there undone. Nor <hi>Banes,</hi> nor <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,</hi> nor any means of fore-knowledge to prevent it. Was this ill? He says, <hi>that when he spake with me about it, I desired him to speak with his Majesty about it, because it was the King's House.</hi> What could I do with more moderation? He confesses he did so, and that he moved the King <hi>that the Cause might be heard at the Council-Table, not at the High-Commission:</hi> To this <hi>his Majesty</hi> inclined, and I opposed nothing; so the general Abuse might be rectified. Then he says, Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> Noye <hi>said at the Council-Table, it was the King's Free-Chappel, and that no Pope in those times offer'd to inhibit there.</hi> First, if Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> did so say, he must have leave to speak freely in the <hi>King's</hi> Cause. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, (as I humbly conceive) the Chappel for ordinary use of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners and Inhabitants of the Tower, where these disorderly Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages are made, is not that which is called <hi>the King's Free-Chappel:</hi> But another in the side of the white Tower by the <hi>King's</hi> Lodgings. Thirdly, if it be, yet I have herein not offended, for I did all that was done by the <hi>King's</hi> leave, not by any assumption of Papal Power. Then he tells the Lords, <hi>that in a Discourse of mine with him at</hi> Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, <hi>about this business, I let fall an Oath.</hi> I am sorry for it, if I did. But that's no <hi>Treason.</hi>
                           <q>
                              <p>And I know whom the Deponent thinks  to please by this Interposition.</p>
                           </q>
For to the matter it belongs not. In conclusion, he says truly, <hi>that the King committed the business to some Lords and Judges, that so an end might be put to it: And in the mean time Ordered, that, till it were ended, there should be no more Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages in the Tower.</hi> How this business ended, I know not. It began I am sure by Authority of his <hi>Majesty's</hi> Grant of the High Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, to question and punish all such Abuses, <hi>Tam in loois Exemptis, quam non Exemptis.</hi> And <hi>his Majesty</hi> having Graciously taken this Care for the Indempnity of the Subject, I troubled my self no more with it: My aim being not to cut off any Priviledges of that Place, but only to prevent the Abuses of that Lawless Custom.
<q>
                              <p>And if <hi>cui bono</hi> be a considerable Circumstance, as it uses to be in all such Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, then it may be thought on too, that this Gentleman the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:54614:160"/>
Lieutenant had a considerable share for his part out of the Fee for every Marriage. Which I believe was as dear to him as the  Priviledge.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The next Instance is broke out of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and got as far as <hi>Oxford.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">V.</note> The Witness <hi>Alderman Nixon.</hi> He says, the <hi>Mayor and the Watch set by him were disturbed by the Proctors of the Vniversity, and a Constable Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned.</hi> The Night-Walk, and the keeping of the Watch, is the ancient, known, and constant Priviledge of the University, for some Hundred of Years; and so the Watch set by the Town (pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely to pick a quarrel) was not according to Law. He adds, <hi>That when the Right Honourable the Earl of</hi> Barkshire <hi>would have referred the business to the King's Councel Learned, I refused, and said I would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it by my own Power, as Chancellor.</hi> If I did say this (which I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remember nor believe) I might better refuse Lawyers, (not the Law, but Lawyers) than they a Sworn Judge of their own Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which they did.</p>
                        <p>The Case was briefly this. There were some five or six Particulars which had, for divers Years, bred much trouble and disagreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Vniversity</hi> and the <hi>City;</hi> of which (to my best remembrance) this about the Night-Watch, and another about Felons Goods, were two of the chief. The <hi>Vniversity</hi> complained to me. I was so far from going any by-way, that I was resolved upon a Tryal at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster-Hall,</hi> thinking (as I after found) that nothing but a Legal Tryal would set those two Bodies at quiet. The Towns-Men liked not this. Came some of the Chief of them to <hi>London:</hi> Prevailed with their Honourable <hi>Steward</hi> my Lord the Earl of <hi>Barkshire,</hi> to come to me to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and by his Lordship offer'd to have all ended without so great Charge at Law, by Reference to any of the Judges. I said I had no mind to wrong the <hi>Town,</hi> or put them to Charge, but thought they would fly off from all Awards, and therefore stuck to have a Legal Tryal. After this, some of the chief <hi>Aldermen</hi> came to me with my Lord, and offer'd me, that if the <hi>Vniversity</hi> would do the like, they would go down and bring it up under the <hi>Mayor and Aldermens</hi> Hands, that they would stand to such end as Judge <hi>Jones,</hi> who rode that Circuit, should upon Hearing make. They did so: And brought the Paper so Subscribed (and therefore I think <hi>Alderman Nixon's</hi> Hand is to it as well as the rest) upon this I gave way; the <hi>Vniversity</hi> accepted; the <hi>Judge</hi> heard and setled. And now when they saw my Troubles threatning me, they brake all, whistled up their <hi>Recorder</hi> to come and complain at the <hi>Council-Table, his Majesty</hi> present. And I remember well, I told his Lordship (then making the aforesaid Motion to refer to the <hi>King's</hi> Learned Councel) that his Lordship well knew what had passed, and that being so used as I had been by the Townsmen, I would trouble my self with no more Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences to Lawyers, or to that effect. And I appeal to the Honour of my Lord, whether this be not a true Relation.</p>
                        <p>The Sixth Instance concerns the putting of one Mr. <hi>Grant</hi> out of <note place="margin">VI.</note> his Right. He says, (but he is single and in his own Cause) <hi>That Mr.</hi> Bridges <hi>was presented to an Impropriation, and that suing for Tythe, He (the said</hi> Grant <hi>) got a Prohibition, and Mr.</hi> Bridges <hi>a Reference to the then Lord Keeper</hi> Coventry, <hi>and my self; that we referred them to the</hi>
                           <pb n="297" facs="tcp:54614:160"/>
                           <hi>Law, and that there</hi> Grant <hi>was Non-Suited, and so outed of his Right.</hi> First, in all this there's nothing said to be done by me alone. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi> who well understood the Law, thought it fittest to refer them to the Law; and so we did. If he were there Non-Suited first, and outed after, it was the Law that put him out, not we.
<q>
                              <p>Yet your Lordships see here was a <hi>Prohibition</hi> granted in a  Case which the Law it self after rejected.</p>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then follows the Instance, that I had a purpose to Abolish all Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations. <note place="margin">VII.</note> The first Proof alledged, was a passage out of Bishop <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                           <hi>Mountague's</hi> Book, <hi>p.</hi> 210. That <hi>Tythes were due by Divine Right, and then no Impropriations might stand.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> witnessed very carefully: <hi>That this Book was found in my own Study, and given me by Bishop</hi> Mountague. And what of this? Doth any <hi>Bishop</hi> Print a Book, and not give the Arch-Bishop one of them? Or must I answer for every Proposition that is in every Book that is in my Study? Or that any Author gives me? And if Bishop <hi>Mountague</hi> be of Opinion that Tythes are due by Divine Right, what is that to me? Your Lordships know, many Men are of different Opinions in that difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and I am confident you will not determin the Controversie by an <hi>Act of Parliament.</hi> They were nibling at my <hi>Diary</hi> in this, to <note place="margin">Diary, in fine. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                              <p>Which Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> (in his gentle Language) calls  Robbing of the Crown.</p>
                           </q>
                           <hi>My Lords,</hi> the Case was this. The Lord Primate of <hi>Armagh</hi> writ unto me, how ill Conditioned the State of that Church was for want of Means, and besought me that I would move <hi>his Majesty</hi> to give the Impropriations there, which yet remained in the Crown, for the Maintenance and Incouragement of able Ministers to Live among the People, and Instruct them: Assuring me, they were daily one by one begged away by Private Men, to the great prejudice both of Crown and Church. And the Truth of this, the <hi>Lord Primate</hi> is now in this Kingdom, and will witness. I acquainted the <hi>King's</hi> great Officers, the <hi>Lord Treasurer</hi> and the <hi>Chancellor of the Exchequer</hi> with it. And after long delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>King</hi> was pleased, at my humble Suit, to grant them in the way which I proposed. Which was, that when they came into the Clergies Hands, they should pay all the Rents respectively to the <hi>King;</hi> and some consideration for the several Renewings. And the Truth of this appears in the Deeds. So here was no Robbing of the Crown. For the <hi>King</hi> had all his set Rents reserved to a Penny, and Consideration for his Casualties beside. And, <hi>my Lords,</hi> the increase of Popery is complained of in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Is there a better way to hinder this growth, than to place an Able Clergy among the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants? Can an Able Clergy be had without Means? Is any
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:54614:161"/>
Means fitter than Impropriations restored? <hi>My Lords,</hi> I did this, as holding it the best Means to keep down Popery, and to advance the Protestant Religion. And I wish with all my Heart, I had been able to do it sooner, before so many Impropriations were gotten from the Crown into Private Hands.</p>
                        <p>Next I was Charged with another Project in my <hi>Diary,</hi> which <note place="margin">VIII.</note> was to settle some fixed <hi>Commendams</hi> upon all the smaller <hi>Bishopricks.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Diary, fine. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                              <hi>8.</hi>
                           </note> For this, I said their own Means were too small to live and keep any Hospitality, little exceeding Four or Five Hundred Pound a Year. I consider'd that the <hi>Commendams</hi> taken at large and far distant, caused a great dislike and murmur among many Men. That they were in some Cases <hi>Materia Odiosa,</hi> and justly complained of. And hereupon I thought it a good Church-work, to settle some Temporal Lease, or some Benefice <hi>Sine Cura</hi> upon the lesser <hi>Bishopricks;</hi> but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but such as was in their own Right and Patronage: That so no other Man's Patronage might receive prejudice by the Bishop's <hi>Commendam:</hi> Which was not the least Rock of Offence, against which <hi>Commendams</hi> indanger'd themselves. And that this was my intent and endeavour, is expressed in my <hi>Diary:</hi> And I cannot be sorry for it.</p>
                        <p>Then I was Accused for setting Old Popish Canons above the Laws. <note place="margin">IX.</note> Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> is the sole Witness. He says, <hi>it was in a Case about a Pew, in which those Canons did weigh down an Act of Parliament.</hi>
                           <q>
                              <p>I did never think till now Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> would have made any <hi>Canons</hi>  Pew-Fellows with an <hi>Act of Parliament.</hi>
                              </p>
                           </q>

                           </hi> Testimony for this have been produced at the second In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of this day? For in the end of that is just such another Charge; and the Answer there given will satisfie this, and that <note place="margin">25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 19. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                           </note> by <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> too.</p>
                        <p>After this came a Charge with a great out-cry, that since my <note place="margin">X.</note> coming to be <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> I had renewed the <hi>High-Commission,</hi> and put in many Illegal and Exorbitant Clauses, which were not in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Both the Commissions were produced. Upon this I humbly desired, that the <hi>Dockett</hi> might be Read; by which their Lordships might see all those Particulars which were added in the New Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and so be able to Judge, how fit or unfit they were to be added. The <hi>Dockett</hi> was Read. And there was no Particular found, but such as highly deserved Punishment, and were of Ecclesiastical Cognizance, as Blasphemy, Schism, and two or three more of like Nature.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In this Charge, the first Exorbitant Clause they insisted on, as added to the new Commission, was the <hi>Power given</hi> in locis Exemptis, &amp; non Exemptis, <hi>as if it were thereby intended to destroy all Priviledges.</hi> No, not to destroy any Priviledge, but not to suffer Enormous Sins to have any Priviledge. Besides, this Clause hath ever been in all Commissions that ever were Granted. And I then shewed it to the Lords in the Old Commission there present, <hi>p.</hi> 28, 32, 35, 42.
<q>
                              <p>Nay more, this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>tam in locis Exemptis quam non Exemptis,</hi> is allowed to the Governours of the Church, in the Exercise of their Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <note place="margin">
                                    <hi>1</hi> Eliz. c. <hi>2.</hi>
                                 </note> Jurisdiction, by Act of Parliament in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> Time;
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:54614:161"/>
which would never have been allowed, had it then been thought  such a dangerous Business, as 'tis now made against me.</p>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Second Clause was <hi>Power to Censure, by Fine and Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment.</hi> This also I shewed in the old Commission, <hi>Fol.</hi> 37. and is (as I conceive) in plain pursuance of the <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1: §. 8.</note> upon which the <hi>High-Commission</hi> is grounded. For the <hi>King</hi> says there, <hi>Fol.</hi> 13. (And so 'tis in the new) That he grants this Power, by Vertue of his Supream Authority, and Prerogative Royal, <note n="*" place="margin">The Words of the Statute are By <hi>Vertue of this Act.</hi>
                           </note> 
                           <hi>and of the said Act.</hi> Nay farther, 'tis added in this latter Commission, <hi>and by our Authority Ecclesiastical,</hi> which is not expressed in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. And sure I would never have caused <hi>Authority Ecclesiastical</hi> to be added, had I any Plot (as 'tis urged) either to exalt the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy above the Laity, or to usurp <hi>Papal Power;</hi> which all Men know is far enough from ascribing Ecclesiastical Authority to <hi>the King.</hi> And as for Fine and Imprisonment; if that Power be not according to Law, why was it first admitted, and after continued in all former Commissions?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Third Clause, was the <hi>Non Obstante,</hi> which he said was <hi>against all Law, and of such a boundless Extent, as was never found in Commission or other Grant in England.</hi> And he here desired the Lords, that he might read it, which he did, with great Assurance of a Triumph. But after all this Noise, which Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> had made, I shewed the same <hi>Non Obstante</hi> in the Old Commission, <hi>
                              <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap>.</hi> 62. Word for Word, which I humbly desired might be read and compared: It was so. The Lords looked strangely upon it: Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> was so startled, that he had not Patience to stay till his Reply, (which he saw impossible to be made) but interrupted me, and had the Face to say in that Honourable Assembly, that I need not stand upon that, for he did but name that, without much regarding it. And yet at the giving of the Charge, he insisted principally upon that Clause, and in higher and louder Terms than are before expressed. Had such an Advantage been found against me, I should have been accounted extreamly Negligent if I compared not the Commissions together; or Extreamly Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, if I did.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The Fourth Exception was, <hi>That by this Commission I took greater Power than ever any Court had, because both Temporal and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical.</hi> First, whatsoever Power the <hi>High-Commission</hi> had, was not taken by them, till given by <hi>his Majesty,</hi> and that according to Use and Statue, (for ought hath been yet declared.) Secondly, they have not Power of Life or Limb, therefore not so great Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as other Courts have. Thirdly, they may have more various Power in some respects, but that cannot make it greater.
<q>
                              <p>As for the Expression in which 'tis said, <hi>I took this Power;</hi> that is put most unworthily and unjustly too, to derive the Envy as much  as he could upon my Person only.</p>
                           </q>
For he could not hold from comparing me to Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> 8. and saying, that <hi>I took on me the Power of both Swords.</hi> But this was only <hi>ad Faciendum Populum.</hi> For he knows well enough, that to take both the Swords, as the <hi>Pope</hi> takes them, is to challenge them Originally as due to him and his Place: Not to take both, as under the Prince, and given by
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:54614:162"/>
his Authority; and so, not I alone, but all the Commissioners take theirs.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Fifthly, To prove that this vast Commission (as it was called) was put in execution, Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> is produced. He says, that <hi>when he was called into the</hi> High-Commission, <hi>he appealed to the</hi> King, <hi>and pleaded his Appeal; and that thereupon I and the Bishop of</hi> London <hi>Writ to the King to have him submit to the Court.</hi> He confesses he was dismissed upon his Appeal, till <hi>his Majesty's</hi> Pleasure was farther known. And it was our Duty, considering what a Breach this would make upon the Jurisdiction of the Court, to inform <hi>his Majesty</hi> of it; and we did so. <hi>The King</hi> declared that he should submit to the Court, as is confessed by himself. Then he says, <hi>because he would not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Court, he was Censured notwithstanding his Appeal.</hi> And he well deserved it, that would not be ruled by <hi>his Majesty,</hi> to whom he had appealed. And the Commission had Power to do what they did. Besides, himself confesses, all this was done by the <hi>High-Commission,</hi> not by me. Nor doth he urge any Threat, Promise, or Solicitation of mine, any way to particularize the Act upon me; and farther, he is single, and in his own Cause.</p>
                        <p>Then followed the last Charge of this Day, which was the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <note place="margin">XI.</note> granted for the Fines in the <hi>High-Commission</hi> for Finishing the West End of St: <hi>Pauls,</hi> cryed out upon as Illegal, and Extorted from <hi>the King,</hi> and such as took all Power from him for the space of the Ten Years, for which time it was granted. This is the Fourth time that St: <hi>Pauls</hi> is struck at. <hi>My Lords,</hi> let it come as often as it will, my Project and Endeavour in that Work was Honest and Honourable, to both Church and Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> No Man in all this Search and Pursuit hath been able to charge me with the turning of any one Penny, or Pennyworth, to other use than was limited to me. I took a great deal of Care and Pains about the Work, and cannot repent of any thing I did in that Service, but of Humane Frailty. And whereas 'tis said, <hi>this Patent was extorted from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty;</hi> as there is no Proof offered for it, so is there no truth in it. For <hi>his Majesty's</hi> Piety was so forward, that nothing needed to be extorted from him. Thus went I on, <hi>Bonâ Fide,</hi> and took the Prime Direction of the Kingdom for drawing the Patent: <hi>The Lord Keeper</hi> Coventry, <hi>Mr.</hi> Noy, <hi>and Sir</hi> Henry Martin. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any thing be found against Law in it, it cannot be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me, who took all the care I could to have it beyond excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And I marvel what security any Man shall have, that adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures upon any great and publick Work in this Kingdom; if such Councel cannot be trusted for drawing up of his Warrant.
<q>
                              <p>And whereas it was said, <hi>this Patent for the Ten Years space took away both Justice and Mercy from the King:</hi> That's nothing so. For whatever the Words be to enable me the better for that Work, yet these being inseparable from him, may be used by him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this or any other Patent. And if these be insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (as 'tis granted they are) no inseparable thing can be taken away; or if it be taken, 'tis void in Law, and the King is where he was in the Exercise of his Right, both for Justice and Mercy. And so I answered Mr. <hi>Brown's</hi> summary Charge against me; and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:54614:162"/>
as for that which he farther urged concerning S. <hi>Gregory's</hi> Church, Mr. <hi>Jingo Jones</hi> and others were trusted with that whole Business, and were Censured for it in this present Parliament. In all which  Examination, no part of the Charge fell on me.</p>
                           </q>
And because here are so many things urged about Free-Chappels, Lay-Fees, Patents, Appeals, and the like, I humbly desire a <hi>Salvo</hi> may be entred for me, and that my Councel may be heard for matter of Law, if any Doubt stick with your Lordships.</p>
                        <p>This Day ended, I did, according to my Resolution formerly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, move the Lords for Means, considering my Charge in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and how oft I had Attended and was not Heard. Their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships considered of my Motion, and sent me out Word I should Petition them. I did humbly Petition their Lordships <hi>May</hi> 6. My <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Maii</hi> 6.</note> Petition was presently sent down to the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> that so by both Houses it might be recommended to the Committee for Sequestrations. But upon a Speech in the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> that it was fit to see what would become of me, before they troubled themselves with thinking of Means for me, my Petition was cast aside.</p>

                     <p>AT my Parting from the House, I was ordered to appear again on <hi>Thursday, May</hi> 9. But then fairly put off by an Order <note place="margin">

                        <head>The Ninth Day of my Hearing.</head>
                        <p>The First Charge of this Day was about a Reversion of the <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Maii</hi> 16. 1644.</note> Town-Clerks Office of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> to one Mr. <hi>Lee,</hi> which he desir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Die Nono.</note> might be inserted into the new Charter. First, Mr. <hi>Lee</hi> is single here, and in his own Case. Secondly, it appears by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, <note place="margin">I.</note> out of the Mouth of Mr. <hi>Barnard,</hi> that there was a Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of this Business to those Lords to whom <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> Charter was Referred. For he says, that Mr. <hi>Barnard</hi> told him his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness was stayed, and he thought by me, but did not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>the Lord-Keeper's</hi> Hand were not in it: So it seems by himself, this was done by <hi>the Lords Referees,</hi> and not by me. Thirdly, I did not then think, nor do now, that the Reversion of a Place to be sold for three Hundred Pound, (as he confesses that was) was fit to be put into a Town Charter: But yet neither I, nor the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> did any thing in that stop, but what we acquainted
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:54614:163"/>
                           <hi>his Majesty</hi> with, and had his Approbation of. And, whereas he says, that he acquainted the Right Honourable the <hi>Earl of Dorset</hi> with the stay that was made, and <hi>That thereupon his Lordship should say, Have we Two Kings?</hi> I cannot believe that Honourable Lord would so say, unless he were much abused by Mr. <hi>Lee's</hi> Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Both in regard of his Love to me; And in regard it could not proceed from a Man of so great a Judgment as that Lord is. For, I beseech your Lordships consider, may not Lords, to whom a business is Referred, give <hi>his Majesty</hi> good Reason to alter his Mind in some particulars which they have Debated, and not he? And may not this be done, without any one of them taking on him to be a <hi>Second King?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Second Charge was laid on me by Sir <hi>Arthur Haselrigg:</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">II.</note> (which should have come in the Day before (as Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> said) but that Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> was absent in the necessary service of the State) Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> being single, and in his own Case, says, <hi>That Sir</hi> John Lambe <hi>presented a Blind Parson to a Living of his.</hi> If Sir <hi>John</hi> did that, or any unworthy thing else, <hi>AEtatem habet,</hi> let him answer for himself. He says farther, <hi>That this Living is an Impropriation, and so a Lay-Fee by Law; and that when he told me so much, I made him this answer, That if I Lived, no Man should Name or stand upon his Lay-Fee.</hi> I conceive, <hi>my Lords,</hi> here's a great mistake in the main. For I have been Credibly informed, and do believe, that Benefice is Presentative, and so no Lay-Fee. And then there's no Fault to present unto it, so the Clerk be fit. Secondly, there is a main mistake in my Words, which I remember well, and where it was that I spake them. My Words, under this Gentleman's Favour, and your Lordships, were these and no other, That I had good Information, that the Benefice was Presentative, and that if I lived, I hoped to order it so, that no Man should make a Presenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Benefice a Lay-Fee; there were too many of them already. Thirdly, if I did speak the Words as they are Charged, if they come within that Statute of Six Months, so often mentioned, to that I refer my Self. <hi>Whatsoever the Bird at this time of the Year Sings;</hi> as Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> was pleased to put it upon me. And truly, my Lords, I could easily return all his Bitterness upon himself, could it befit my Person, my present Condition, or my Calling.</p>
                        <p>The Third Charge was about the refusing of a Pardon, which <note place="margin">III.</note> Mrs: <hi>Bastwick</hi> said she produced in the <hi>High-Commission Court,</hi> some Nine or Ten Years since: And she adds, that <hi>I should then say, it should not serve his turn.</hi> But this was no rejecting of the Pardon; for she confesses I said, <hi>I would move his Majesty about it.</hi> So that if it did not serve his turn, it was from <hi>the King</hi> himself, upon Motion made and Reason given, not from any Power assumed by the <hi>High-Commission,</hi> or my self. And the Act, whatever it were, was the Act of the whole Court, not mine. As for the Words (if mine) I give the same Answer as before, notwithstanding Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> his Bird.</p>
                        <p>The Fourth Charge was, That whereas there was a Proclamation <note place="margin">IV.</note> to be Printed about the Pacification with <hi>the Scots,</hi> it was sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stopped, and an Order after for burning of the Pacification. First,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:54614:163"/>
Mr. <hi>Hunscot</hi> is single in this Charge. Secondly, whatsoever was done in this, was by Order of Council: And himself names an <hi>Order,</hi> which could not come from me. Thirdly, he Charges me with nothing but that I sent word the <hi>Proclamation</hi> was to be stayed: Which if I did, I did it by Command. Howsoever, this concerns <hi>the Scottish</hi> business, and therefore to <hi>the Act of Oblivion</hi> I refer my self.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>
                              <p>With this, that I see by this Testimony, Mr. <hi>Hunscourt</hi> (for I took his Name uncertainly) hath not yet forgotten, <hi>Thou shalt commit Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</hi>
                              </p>
                           </q>
So desirous he is to catch me at the Press.</p>
                        <p>The Fifth Charge, was about a Benefice in <hi>North-Hamptonshire,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">V.</note> in the Case of Mr: <hi>Fautrye,</hi> and Mr: <hi>Johnson,</hi> and Dr: <hi>Beal's</hi> succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. In which broken business (for such it was;) First, that business all along was acted by the <hi>High-Commission,</hi> not by me. Secondly, that though in the Case of Simony the Benefice be lost, <hi>Ipso Facto;</hi> yet that must be proved before the Incumbent can be thrust out, and another Instituted; else Church-Men were in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Condition for their Livelyhood. Excommunication is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Cases void in Law, <hi>Ipso Facto,</hi> and yet, <hi>ante latam Sententiam,</hi> till Sentence be orderly pronounced against it, no Man shall be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to those fearful Consequences which follow upon it.
<q>
                              <p>And upon this ground of Natural Equity, that in the Statute concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing  the Uniformity of Common-Prayer proceeds,</p>
                           </q>
where 'tis said, that a party once Convicted for depraving the Common-Prayer <note place="margin">1 <hi>Eliz, c.</hi>

                           </note> Book, and relapsing into the same Crime, shall be deprived of all his Spiritual Promotions, <hi>Ipso Facto:</hi> But how? without any Legal Proceedings? No: God forbid. For the Words preceeding imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately in the Statute, are, <hi>that he must be first Legally Convicted of that Criminal Relapse;</hi> and then follows <hi>Ipso Facto,</hi> and not before: And therefore the superinstitution, before the Simony tryed and jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, was Illegal; beside the great danger to the Parishioners, while two Parsons, and their several Friends are scambling for the Tithes. Secondly, <hi>Fautrye</hi> was not Censured for the Original cause of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, but for an Intruder, and Colluder too, with <hi>Jeames</hi> to Abuse <hi>the Kings</hi> grant of the Benefice. Thirdly, it seems <hi>Fautrye</hi> had no better Opinion of his own Cause: for he went to his Benefice in <hi>Jarsey,</hi> and set not his Title on Foot again till after Seven Years, and that I think was when he heard that Mr. <hi>Johnson</hi> was a Pretender to it. And his Bond upon the Sentence, was to make a final Peace. For <hi>the Prohibition,</hi> which he says <hi>was refused,</hi> I have answered that before in the Charge about <hi>Prohibitions.</hi> Besides, it appears by Law, that as Prohibitions may be granted in some Cases, so in some <note place="margin">13 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1.</note> Cases they may be refused. For Dr. <hi>Beal,</hi> there is not the least shew of Proof offered, that I brought him in; if to do so be a Crime.</p>
                        <p>Thus far Mr. <hi>Fautrye</hi> went. As for Mr. <hi>Johnson's</hi> Title, He says, <hi>That the Lords ordered it for him, and declared that we in the High-Commission could put no Man out of his Freehold.</hi> Where first, if your Lordships have Ordered this Business, I must crave to know how far I shall have leave to speak to it! For if there be any Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Charged upon the Sentence given in <hi>the High-Commission,</hi> if they may not be spoken to, they cannot be satisfied. This I am
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:54614:164"/>
sure of, the Commission hath Power to deprive. For the Statute gives it Power <hi>to use all Ecclesiastical and Spiritual Censures,</hi> of which <note place="margin">1 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                           <hi>Deprivation</hi> is known to be one. And that Power is expresly given, to deprive some Offenders of all their Spiritual Promotions, by the Statute following. Therefore I think it follows necessarily, either <note place="margin">1 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 2.</note> that we have Power over Freehold in that Case; or else that a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice is not a Freehold. But I have no reason howsoever, to speak any thing (were I left never so free) against your Lordships Order, which very honourably left Dr. <hi>Beal</hi> to the Law; as 'tis confessed by <hi>Johnson.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Besides these two in their own Cause, one Mr. <hi>Jenkins</hi> is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, but to what end I know not, unless it be to bespatter Dr. <hi>Beal.</hi> He says, <hi>That Seven Years since Dr.</hi> Beal <hi>was Vice-Chancellor of</hi> Cambridge; <hi>that in his Sermon then he inveighed bitterly against the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Parliaments, and named some unsavoury Speeches of his, both concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Persons and Proceedings.</hi> Surely, if Dr. <hi>Beal</hi> did as is Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, he was much to blame. But what is this to me? If it be said, <hi>I did not punish him:</hi> How could I punish that I knew not? And I profess I heard not of it till now at Bar. If it be said, <hi>I did Prefer him:</hi> That I do absolutely deny; and neither Mr. <hi>Jenkins,</hi> nor any other, offers the least Proof, that I knew the one, or did the other.</p>
                        <p>The Sixth Charge was concerning the Statutes of the University <note place="margin">VI.</note> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> in which, and the Cathedrals of the New Erection, Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> says, I took on me to be an <hi>Vniversal Law-giver.</hi> Many such Offices he bestows upon me, which God knows, and I believe he too, that I never affected: No, <hi>my Lords,</hi> the great Necessities of that <hi>Vniversity</hi> called upon me for it: Their Statutes lay in a misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confused Heap: When any Difficulty arose, they knew not where to look for Remedy, or Direction. Then into the Convocation-House, and make a new Statute; and that many times proved contrary to an Old one concerning the same business. Men in the mean time sworn to both, which could not possibly be kept together. By this means Perjury was in a manner unavoidable: And themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess in their <hi>Register</hi> (which is now in Court) that till this was <note place="margin">

                        <p>Besides, <hi>my Lords,</hi> I did not abolish any the Old Books, in which the Statutes lay so confused, some in one Book, and some in another; but left them all entire in the <hi>Vniversity,</hi> in Case in any after-times any use might be made of them. Nor did I with them, as some Ancient Philosophers are said to have done with the Works of some that went before them: That is, make them away, to advance their own Honour the more, as if without any help of former Pains, they had done all themselves. Holding it Honour more than enough for me, that God had so highly Blessed me in this Work, as to finish and settle those Statutes; which the greatest Men in their times, Cardinal <hi>Wolsey</hi> first, and after him Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> assayed, but left as imperfect as they found them. Neither did I any thing in this Work, but by the consent of the <hi>Vniversity,</hi> and according to an <hi>Act,</hi> (and a <hi>Delegacy</hi> thereby appointed) of their own <hi>Convocation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> says, <hi>There is a Rasure in one of the Acts, and supplied</hi>
                           <pb n="305" facs="tcp:54614:164"/>
                           <hi>in other Ink.</hi> I told <hi>your Lordships</hi> then presently, (being loath to lye never so little under such an Imputation) that if there be any such, it must be Charged upon the <hi>Vniversity,</hi> not upon me; for those Records were never in my Hands, nor is it so much as said they were. And since I withdrew to make my Answer, I have viewed the Record, and an Alteration or Addition there is; and 'tis a known Hand. 'Tis Dr. <hi>Duppa's</hi> Hand, now Lord Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and then <hi>Vice-Chancellor,</hi> who, I doubt not but is able to give a good account of what he did therein, and why. And for ought appears, 'tis nothing but the amendment of some slip, which their Ignorant Register <hi>French</hi> had failed in, and the <hi>Vice-Chancellor</hi> thought it safest to mend with his own Hand. And for my own part, if ever I did any thing worth Thanks from the Publick in all my Life, I did it in this Work for that <hi>Vniversity.</hi> And I wish with all my Heart, the times were so open, as that I might have the <hi>Vniversity's</hi> Testimony, both of me and it.
<q>
                              <p>Since I cannot, a great Lord present in the House, when this Charge was laid against me, supplied in part their Absence. For he was over-heard say to another Lord, I think my Lord Arch-Bishop hath done no Good Work in all his Life,  but these Men will object it as a Crime against him before they have done.</p>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>With this Charge about the Statutes, it was let fall (and I well know why;
<q>
                              <p>It was to heat a Noble Person then present) <hi>That I procured my self to be chosen Chancellour of that Vniversity.</hi>
                              </p>
                           </q>
If I had so done, it might have been a great Ambition in me, but sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no Treason. But, <hi>my Lords,</hi> I have Proof great store, might I be enabled to fetch it from <hi>Oxford,</hi> that I was so far from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to procure this Honour to my self, as that I laboured by my Letters for another. And 'tis well known, that when they had chosen me, I went instantly to <hi>his Majesty,</hi> so soon as ever I heard it, and humbly besought him, that I might refuse it, as well foreseeing the Envy that would follow me for it; and it did plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully every way. But this for some Reasons <hi>his Majesty</hi> would not suffer me to do.</p>
                        <p>Then were objected against me divers Particulars contained in those Statutes. <hi>As First, the making of new Oaths.</hi> The Charters of <note place="margin">1.</note> the <hi>Vniversity</hi> are not new, and they gave Power to make Statutes for themselves, and they have ever been upon <hi>Oath.</hi> The next Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality <note place="margin">

                           </note> is, <hi>That Men are tied to obey the Proctors in Singing the Litany.</hi> This is Ancient, and in use long before ever I came to the <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,</hi> and it is according <hi>to the Liturgy of the Church of England</hi> esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by Law. Thirdly, <hi>The Statute of Bannition from the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">3.</note> But there is nothing more ancient in the <hi>Vniversity</hi> Statutes than this. Fourthly, <hi>That nothing should be propased in Convocation, but</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                           <hi>what was consented unto among the Heads of Colleges first, which was said to be against the Liberty of the Students.</hi> The young Masters of Arts, void of Experience, were grown so tumultuous, that no Peace could be kept in the <hi>Vniversity,</hi> till my worthy Predecessor, the Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> setled this Order among them. As he did also upon the same Grounds settle the present way of the choice of their Proctors: In both which, I did but follow, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm (for so much as lay in me) the Good and Peaceable Grounds,

which he had laid in those two Businesses.
<q>
                              <p>And Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> who in the summing up of my Charge, urged this against me, mainly mistook in two things. The one was, that he said, this Inhibition of Proposals was in <hi>Congregations:</hi> Whereas it was only in <hi>Convocations,</hi> where more weighty Businesses are handled. The other was, that this stay of Proposals was made till <hi>I might be first acquainted with them.</hi> No; it was but till the Heads of Colleges had met, and considered of them, for avoiding of tumultuary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. And when my Honourable Predecessor made that Order, it was highly commended every where; and is it now degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted  into a Crime, because it is made up into a Statute?</p>
                           </q>
Fifthly, <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                           <hi>That some things are referred to Arbitrary Penalties.</hi> And that some things are so referred is usual in that <hi>Vniversity,</hi> and many <hi>Colleges</hi> have a particular Statute for it. Nor is this any more Power, than Ordinary School-Masters have, which have not a Statute-Law for every Punishment they use in Schools. And in divers things, the old known Statute is, that the <hi>Vice-Chancellour</hi> shall proceed <hi>Grosso Modo,</hi> that is, without the regular Forms of Law, for the more speedy ending of Differences among the Scholars. Sixthly, <hi>That the</hi>

                           <hi>Statute made by me against Conventicles, is very strict.</hi> But for these <note place="margin">

Besides, it is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Charter of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second to that <hi>Vniversity.</hi> The Seventh was <hi>the Power of Discommoning.</hi> But this also hath ever been <note place="margin">7.</note> in Power and in Usage in that <hi>Vniversity;</hi> as is commonly known to all <hi>Oxford-Men.</hi> And no longer since than King <hi>James</hi> his time, Bishop <hi>King,</hi> then Vice-Chancellor, Discommuned Three or Four Towns-Men together.

Lastly, <hi>about the stay</hi>

                           <hi>of granting Graces, unless there were Testimony from the Bishop of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocess.</hi>

And for their Conformity to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> none (as I conceive) can be a fitter Witness than the Bishop of the Diocess in which they resided. And, <hi>my Lords,</hi> for all these thus drawn up by some of their own Body, I obtained of his Majesty his Broad Seal for Confirmation: And therefore no one thing in them is by any Assumption of <hi>Papal Power,</hi> as 'tis urged, but by <hi>the King's</hi> Power only.</p>
                        <p>Then followed the Seventh Charge, about the Statutes of some <note place="margin">VII.</note> 
                           <hi>Cathedral Churches.</hi> First, <hi>my Lords,</hi> for this I did it by Letters-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents from the King, bearing Date <hi>Mar.</hi> 31. <hi>Decimo Caroli,</hi> and is extant upon Record. And all that was done, was <hi>Per Juris Remedia,</hi> and so nothing intended against Law, nor done, that I know. They had extream need of Statutes, for all lay loose for want of confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and Men did what they listed: And I could not but observe it, for I was Dean of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> where I found it so. In seeking to remedy this, I had nothing but my Labour for my Pains, and now
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:54614:165"/>
this Accusation to Boot. The Particulars urged are, <hi>That I had Ordered that nothing should be done in these</hi> Statutes, <hi>Me inconsulto.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1.</note> And I had great Reason for it. For since I was principally trusted in that work by his <hi>Majesty,</hi> the King, if any Complaint were made, would expect the account from me. And how could I give it, if other Men might do all, and I not be so much as consulted before they passed?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>That I made a Statute against letting Leases into three Lives.</hi> But first, <hi>my Lords,</hi> the Statute which makes it lawful to let Leases for <note place="margin">13 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 10. §. <hi>Penult.</hi>
                           </note> One and Twenty Years, or three Lives, hath this limitation in it, <hi>that they shall not let for any more Years than are limited by the said Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges or Churches.</hi> Now in <hi>Winchester</hi> Church, and some other, the old local Statute is most plain, that they shall let no Lease into Lives. Let the Dean and Prebendaries Answer their own Acts and their Consciences as they can. And in those Statutes which I did not find pregnant to that purpose, I did not make the Statute absolute, but left them free to renew all such Leases as were Anciently in Lives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And this give me leave to say to your Lordships, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; If but a few more Leases be granted into Lives, no <hi>Bishop</hi> nor <hi>Cathedral Church</hi> shall be able to subsist. And this is considerable also, that, as the state of the Church yet stands, the Laity have the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, by the Leases which they hold, of more than five parts of all <hi>the Bishops, Deans and Chapters, and College</hi> Revenues in <hi>England.</hi>
                           <q>
                              <p>And shall it be yet an Eye-sore to serve themselves with the rest of their own? This Evidence Mr. <hi>Browne,</hi> whose part it was to summ up the Evidence against me at the end of the Charge, wholly omitted:  For what Cause he best knows.</p>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The next Charge <hi>was about my Injunctions in my Visitation of</hi> Winton <note place="margin">VIII.</note> 
                           <hi>and</hi> Sarum, <hi>for the taking down of some Houses.</hi> But they were such as were upon Consecrated Ground, and ought not to have been built there; and yet with caution sufficient to preserve the Lessees from over-much dammage. For it appears <hi>apud Acta,</hi> that they were not to be pulled down till their several Leases were expired. And that they were Houses not built long since, but by them; and that all this was to be done, to the end that the Church might suffer no dammage by them: And that this demolition was to be made <hi>Juxta Decreta Regni,</hi> according to the Statutes of the Kingdom. Therefore nothing injoyned contrary to Law: Or if any thing were, the Injunction took not place, by the very Tenor of that which was charged.
<q>
                              <p>Mr. <hi>Browne</hi> omitted this Charge also, though he hung heavily upon the like at St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> though there was satisfaction given, and  not here.</p>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Ninth Charge <hi>was my intended Visitation of both the Vniversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">IX.</note> Oxford <hi>and</hi> Cambridge. For my Troubles began then to be foreseen by me, and I Visited them not. This was urged as a thing <note place="margin">1.</note> directly against Law. But this I conceive cannot be, so long as it was with the <hi>King's</hi> Knowledge, and by his Warrant. Secondly, <note place="margin">2.</note> because all Power of the <hi>King's</hi> Visitations was saved in the Warrant, and that with consent of all parts. Thirdly, because nothing in this <note place="margin">3.</note> was surreptitiously gotten from the <hi>King,</hi> all being done at a most full Council-Table, and great Councel at Law heard on both sides.

                              <p>Mr. <hi>Browne</hi> wholly neglected this Charge also, which, making such a shew, I think he would not  have done, had he found it well grounded.</p>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Tenth Charge was my Visitation of <hi>Merton</hi> College in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">X.</note> The Witness Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent,</hi> the Warden of the College, and principally concerned in that business. He said, First, <hi>that no</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                           <hi>Visitation held so long.</hi> But if he consult his own Office, he may find one much longer, held and continued at <hi>All-Souls</hi> College by my worthy Predecessor Arch-Bishop <hi>Whitgift.</hi> Secondly, he urged <hi>that</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                           <hi>I should say I would be Warden for Seven Years:</hi> If I did so say, there was much need I should make it good. Thirdly, <hi>That one Mr.</hi> Rich. <note place="margin">3.</note> Nevil, <hi>Fellow of that College, lay abroad in an Ale-House, that a Wench was got with Child in that House, and he accused of it; and that this was complained of to me, and Sir</hi> Nath. Brent <hi>accused for Conspiring with the Ale-Wife against</hi> Nevil. I am not here to accuse the one or defend the other. But the Case is this. This Cause between them was publick, and came to Hearing in the <hi>Vice-Chancellor's</hi> Court, Witnesses Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, Mr. <hi>Nevil</hi> acquitted, and the Ale-Wife punished. In all this I had no Hand. Then in my Visitation it was again complained of to me. I liked not the business; but forbare to do any thing in it, because it had been Legally Censured upon the place.
<q>
                              <p>This part of the Charge Mr. <hi>Browne</hi> urged against me in the House of Commons,  and I gave it the same Answer.</p>
                           </q>
Lastly, when I sate to hear the <note place="margin">4.</note> main Business of that College, Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent</hi> was beholding to me that he continued Warden. For in Arch-Bishop <hi>Warham's</hi> time, a Predecessor of his was expelled for less than was proved against him. And I found that true which one of my Visitors had formerly told me, namely, That Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent</hi> had so carried himself in that College, as that if he were guilty of the like, he would lay his Key under the Door, and be gone, rather than come to Answer it. Yet I did not think it fit to proceed so rigidly. But while I was going to open some of the Particulars against him, Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> cut me off, and told the Lords, this was to scandalize their Witnesses. So I forbare.</p>
                        <p>Then followed the last Charge of this day, concerning a Book of <note place="margin">XI.</note> Dr: <hi>Bastwick's,</hi> for which he was Censured in the <hi>High-Commission.</hi> The Witnesses in this Charge were three. Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> a Mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of mine, and so he hath shewed himself. Mrs. <hi>Bastwick,</hi> a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and a Wife, and well Tutoured: For she had a Paper, and all written which she had to say; though I saw it not till 'twas too late.
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:54614:166"/>
And Mr. <hi>Hunscot,</hi> a Man that comes in to serve all turns against me, since the Sentence passed against the Printers, for, <hi>Thou shalt commit Adultery.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the Particulars of this Charge, 'tis first said, <hi>That this Book was</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                           <hi>written Contra Episcopos Latiales.</hi> But how cunningly so-ever this was pretended, 'tis more than manifest, it was purposely written and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged against the Bishops and Church of <hi>England.</hi> Secondly, <hi>that I</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                           <hi>said that Christian Bishops were before Christian Kings:</hi> So <hi>Burton</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Bastwick.</hi> And with due Reverence to all Kingly Authority be it spoken, who can doubt but that there were many Christian Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, before any King was Christian? Thirdly, Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> says, <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                           <hi>that I applied those words in the Psalm,</hi> whom thou may'st make Princes <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 17.</note> in all Lands, <hi>to the Bishops.</hi> For this if I did err in it, many of the Fathers of the Church mis-led me, who Interpret that place so. And if I be mistaken, 'tis no <hi>Treason.</hi> But I shall ever follow their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <note place="margin">4.</note> before Mr. <hi>Burton's.</hi> Fourthly, Mrs. <hi>Bastwick</hi> says that I then said, <hi>no Bishop and no King:</hi> If I did say so, I Learned it of a Wise and Experienced Author, King <hi>James,</hi> who spake it out and plainly <note place="margin">Conf. at Hamps. Court. p. <hi>84.</hi>
                           </note> in the Conference at <hi>Hampton-Court.</hi> And I hope it cannot be Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in me to repeat it. Fifthly, Mrs. <hi>Bastwick</hi> complained, <hi>that I</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                           <hi>committed her Husband close Prisoner.</hi> Not I, but the <hi>High-Commission;</hi> not close Prisoner to his Chamber, but to the Prison, not to go abroad with his Keeper. Which is all the close Imprisonment which I ever knew that Court use. Lastly, the pinch of this Charge is, <hi>that I said,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                           <hi>I received my Jurisdiction from God, and from Christ, contrary to an Act</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">37 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 17.</note> 
                           <hi>of Parliament, which says Bishops, derive their Jurisdiction from the King:</hi> This is Witnessed by all three, and that Dr. <hi>Bastwick</hi> read the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute. That Statute speaks plainly of Jurisdiction <hi>in foro Contentioso,</hi> and places of Judicature, and no other. And all this forinsecal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, I and all Bishops in <hi>England</hi> derive from the Crown. But my Order, my Calling, my Jurisdiction <hi>in foro Conscientiae,</hi> that is from God, and from Christ, and by Divine and Apostolical Right. And of this Jurisdiction it was that I then spake (if I named <hi>Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> at all, and not my Calling in general.) For I then sate in the <hi>High-Commission,</hi> and did Exercise the former Jurisdiction under the Broad Seal, and could not be so simple to deny the Power by which I then sate. Beside, the Canons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to which <note place="margin">Can. <hi>1.</hi>
                           </note> I have Subscribed, are plain for it. Nay farther: The Use and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of my Jurisdiction <hi>in foro Conscientiae,</hi> may not be but by the Leave and Power of the <hi>King</hi> within his Dominions. And if <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> be all one Order (as these Men contend for) then <hi>Bishops</hi> must be <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> for so they maintain that <hi>Presbyters</hi> are.

                              <p>This part of the Charge Mr. <hi>Browne</hi> pressed in his Report to the House of Commons: And when I gave this same Answer, he in his Reply said nothing but the same over and over again, save that he said, <hi>I fled to he knew not what inward Calling and Jurisdiction;</hi> which point as I expressed it, if he understood not, he should not have undertaken  to Judge me.</p>

First a Connivence, then a Toleration, then a Subversion. Nor this, nor that. But a Tide it seems he will have of Religion. And I pray God his Truth, (the True <hi>Protestant</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion here Established) sink not to so low an Ebb, that Men may with ease wade over to that side, which this Gentleman seems most to hate.

                           <q>
                              <p>And this was also earnestly pressed by Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> when he repeated the Summ of the Charge against me in the House of  Commons.</p>
                           </q>
To which I answered at both times: First, that the Statute of <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. spake of other Images; and that Images in Glass-Windows, were neither mentioned, nor meant in that Law: The Words of the Statute are, <hi>Any Images of Stone, Timber, Alabaster or Earth; Graven, Carved or Painted, taken out of any Church, &amp;c. shall be Destroyed, &amp;c.</hi> and not reserved to any Superstitious Use. So here's not a Word of Glass-Windows, nor the Images that are in them. Secondly, that the Contemporary Practice, (which is one of
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:54614:168"/>
the best Expounders of the meaning of any Law) did neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy all coloured Windows, though Images were in them, in the <hi>Queens</hi> time, nor abstain from setting up of new, both in her, and <hi>King James</hi> his Time. And as the Body of this Statute is utterly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken, so is the Penalty too; which <hi>for the First and Second Offence is but a small Fine; and but Imprisonment at the King's Will for the Third.</hi>
                           <q>
                              <p>A great way short of Punishment for Treason. And I could not but wonder that Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> should be so earnest in this Point, considering he is of <hi>Lincolns-Inn,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Pryn's</hi> Zeal hath not yet beaten down the Images of the <hi>Apostles</hi> in the fair Windows of that Chappel; which Windows also were set up new long since that Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> 6. And tis well known, that I was once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to have returned this upon Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, but changed my Mind, lest thereby I might have set some furious Spirit on Work to destroy those harmless, goodly  Windows; to the just dislike of that Worthy Society.</p>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>But to the Statute Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> added, <hi>That the Destruction of all Images, as well in Windows, as elsewhere, were</hi> 
                           <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>l.</hi> was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, <hi>or</hi> Commanded.</note> 
                           <hi>Condemned by the Homilies of the Church of England, and those Homilies confirmed in the Articles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the Articles by Act of Parliament.</hi> This was also urged before; <note place="margin">Art. <hi>35.</hi>
                           </note> and my Answer was, First, that though we Subscribed generally to the Doctrine of the Homilies, as good: Yet we did not express, or mean thereby to justifie and maintain every particular Phrase or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence contained in them.

                              <p>Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> touched upon this, and my Answer was the same, saving that I mentioned not the Lady. Secondly, <hi>That I had in my Study</hi>

                        <p>The Third Picture found in my Gallery, I marvel why it was <note place="margin">3.</note> produced. For it relates to that of our Saviour, St. <hi>John.</hi> 10. Where <note place="margin">

So 'tis as directly against <hi>Popery</hi> as can be. Besides, it was Witnessed before the Lords by Mr. <hi>Walter Dobson,</hi> an Ancient Servant, both to Arch-Bishop <hi>Bancroft</hi> and <hi>Abbot,</hi> that both the <hi>Ecce Homo</hi> and this Picture, were in the Gallery when he came first to <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth-House,</hi> which was about Forty Years since.

This passage was read, and by this it seems, the Devil's Cunning was, so soon as he saw Superstition thrust out of this
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:54614:170"/>
Church, to bring Irreverence and Prophaneness in.

                              <p>Here Mr. <hi>Browne</hi> having pressed this Charge, Replies upon me in his last, <hi>that I would admit no mean, but either there must be Superstition or Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> whereas my words can infer no such thing. I said this was the Devil's Practice. I would have brought in the mean between  them, and preserved it too by God's Blessing, had I been let alone.</p>

Fifthly, He says <hi>the hanging up of this piece was a great scandal to Men but indifferently affected to Religion.</hi> Here I humbly crave leave to observe some few Particulars. First, that here's no proof so much as offer'd, that the piece was hung up by me or my Command. Secondly, that this Gentleman came often to me to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and professed much Love to me, yet was never the <note place="margin">1.</note> Man that told me his Conscience, or any Mans else was troubled at <note place="margin">2.</note> it; which had he done, that should have been a scandal to no Man. Thirdly, that if this were scandalous to any, it must be offensive in <note place="margin">3.</note> regard of the Workmanship; or <hi>Quatenus Tale,</hi> as it was a Crucifix. Not in regard of the work certainly, for that was very exact. And then if it were because it was a <hi>Crucifix,</hi> why did not the old one offend Sir <hi>Henry's</hi> Conscience as much as the new? For the piece of Hangings which hung constantly all the Year at the back of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, thirty Years together upon my own Knowledge, and somewhat above, long before, (as I offer'd proof by the <hi>Vestry</hi> Men) and so all the time of Sir <hi>Henry's</hi> being in Court, had a <hi>Crucifix</hi> wrought in it, and yet his Conscience never troubled at it. Fourthly, that he could <note place="margin">4.</note> not possibly think that I intended any Popery in it, considering how hateful he knew me to be at <hi>Rome,</hi> beyond any my Predecessors since the Reformation. For so he protested at his return from thence to my self. And I humbly desire a <hi>Salvo,</hi> that I may have him called to Witness it. Which was granted.</p>
                        <p>When they had charged me thus far, there came up a Message from the House of <hi>Commons.</hi> I was commanded to withdraw. But that Business requiring more haste, I was dismissed with a Command to attend again on <hi>Wednesday May</hi> 22. But then I was put off again <note place="margin">Maij <hi>22.</hi>

                        <hi>Father.</hi> But his thinking so is no proof: Nor doth he express in which of the North Windows he saw it. And for the <hi>Glory,</hi> that is usual about the Head of every <hi>Saint.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> who was the Second Witness, and was trusted by me for all the work of the <note place="margin">2.</note> Windows, both at <hi>Lambeth</hi> and <hi>Croydon,</hi> says expresly upon his Oath, that there was no Picture of God the Father in the Windows at <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</hi> But he says, <hi>He found a Picture of God the Father in a Window at</hi> Croydon, <hi>and Arch-Bishop</hi> Cranmer's <hi>Arms under it, and that he pulled it down.</hi> So it appears this Picture was there before my time: And continued there in so Zealous an Arch-Bishop's time as <hi>Cranmer</hi> was well known to be, and it was pulled down in my time. Neither did I know till now, that ever such a Picture was there; and the Witness deposes, <hi>he never made me acquainted with it.</hi> The Third <note place="margin">3.</note> Witness was Mr. <hi>Pryn.</hi> He says, <hi>he had taken a survey of the Windows at</hi> Lambeth. And I doubt not his diligence. <hi>He repeated the Story in each Window.</hi> I have told this before, and shall not repeat it. He says, <hi>the Pictures of these Stories</hi> are in the <hi>Mass-Book.</hi> If it be so, yet they were not taken thence by me. Arch-Bishop <hi>Morton</hi> did that work, as appears by his Device in the Windows. He says, <hi>the Story of the day of Judgment was in a Window</hi> in atrio, <hi>that must not come into the Chappel.</hi> Good Lord, whither will Malice carry a Man? The Story opposite is of the Creation; and what, must not that come into the Chappel neither? The Chappel is divided into an inner and utter Chappel. In this outward the two Windows mentioned are. And the Partition or Skreen of the Chappel, which makes it two, was just in the same place where now it stands, from the very building of the Chappel, for ought can be proved to the contrary. So neither I nor any Man else did shut out the day of Judgment. He says, <hi>I had Read the Mass-Book diligently.</hi> How else should I be able really to confute what is amiss in it? He says, <hi>I had also a Book of Pictures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Life of</hi> Christ <hi>in my Study.</hi> And it was fit for me to have
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:54614:171"/>
it. For some things are to be seen in their Pictures for the People, which their Writings do not, perhaps dare not avow.</p>
                     <p>The Second Charge of this day, was about the Administration of <note place="margin">II.</note> the Sacrament in my Chappel. The Witnesses two.</p>
                     <p>The first was Dr. <hi>Haywood,</hi> who had been my Chaplain in the <note place="margin">1.</note> House. They had got from others the Ceremonies there used, and then brought him upon Oath. <hi>He confessed he Administred in a Cope.</hi> And the Canon warranted it. He confesses (as it was urged) <hi>that he</hi>

                        </note> 
                        <hi>fetched the Elements from the Credential</hi> (a little Side-Table as they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it) <hi>and set them Reverently upon the Communion Table.</hi> Where's the offence? For first, the Communion Table was little, and there was hardly room for the Elements to stand conveniently there, while the Service was in Administration. And Secondly, I did not this without Example; for both Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> and some other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, used it so all their time, and no exception taken. The Second Witness was <hi>Rob. Cornwall,</hi> one of my Menial Servants. A very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Witness he shewed himself. But said no more than is said and answered before. Both of them confessing that I was sometimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
                     <p>The Third Charge was about the Ceremonies at the Coronation of <note place="margin">III.</note> his <hi>Majesty.</hi> And first out of my <hi>Diary, Feb:</hi> 2: 1625. 'Tis urged, <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                        <hi>that I carried back the</hi> Regalia, <hi>offer'd them on the Altar, and then laid them up in their place of safety.</hi> I bare the place at the Coronation of the <hi>Dean of Westminster,</hi> and I was to look to all those things, and their safe return into Custody, by the place I then Executed. And the offering of them could be no offence. For the <hi>King</hi> himself offers upon solemn days. And the Right Honourable <hi>the Knights of the Garter</hi> offer at their Solemnity. And the <hi>Offertory</hi> is Established by Law in the Common Prayer Book of this Church. And the Preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries assured me it was the Custom for the <hi>Dean</hi> so to do. Secondly, <note place="margin">2.</note> they charged a Marginal Note in the Book upon me: <hi>That the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was</hi> in formâ Crucis. That Note doth not say that it ought so to be done; but it only relates the Practice, what was done. And if any fault were in Anointing the King in that form, it was my Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors fault, not mine, for he so Anointed him. They say, <hi>there was a</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                        <hi>Crucifix among the</hi> Regalia, <hi>and that it stood upon the Altar at the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>

                           <hi>Heylin</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the old <hi>Crucifix,</hi> being found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>

                        </note> 
                        <hi>and that I did not except against it.</hi> My Predecessor Executed at that time. And I believe would have excepted against the <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix</hi> had it stood there. But I remember not any there. Yet if there were, if my Predecessor approved the standing of it, or were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to connive at it, it would have been made but a Scorn had I quarrell'd it. They say <hi>one of the Prayers was taken out of the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">4.</note> And I say, if it were, it was not taken thence by me. And the Prayers are the same that were used at King <hi>James</hi> his Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And so the Prayer be good (and here's no word in it, that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted against) 'tis no matter whence 'tis taken.</p>
                     <p>Then leaving the Ceremonies, he charged me with two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> the Body of the King's Oath. One added, namely these Words (<hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> to the King's Prerogative.</hi>) The other omitted, namely these words, (<hi>Quae Populus Elegerit, which the People have chosen, or shall choose.</hi>) For this latter, the <hi>Clause omitted,</hi> that suddenly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:54614:171"/>
For it was omitted in the Oath of King <hi>James,</hi> as is confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by themselves in the <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>p.</hi> 706.</note> Printed Votes of this present Parliament. But the other highly insisted on, <hi>as taking off the total assurance which the Subjects have by the Oath of their Prince for the performance of his Laws.</hi> First, I humbly conceive this Clause takes off none of the Peoples Assurance; none at all. For the King's Just and Legal Prerogative, and the Subjects Assurance for Liberty and Property may stand well together, and have so stood for Hundreds of Years. Secondly, that Alteration, what ever it be, was not made by me; nor is there any Interlining or Alteration so much as of a Letter found in that Book. Thirdly, if any thing be amiss therein, my Predecessor gave that Oath to the King, and not I. I was meerly Ministerial, both in the Preparation, and at the Coronation it self, supplying the place of the <hi>Dean of Westminster.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this days work was ended, it instantly spread all over the City, that I had altered the <hi>King's</hi> Oath at his Coronation, and from thence into all parts of the Kingdom; as if all must be true which was said at the Bar against me, what Answer so-ever I made. The People and some of the <hi>Synod</hi> now crying out, that this one thing was enough to take away my Life. And though this was all that was Charged this day concerning this Oath, yet seeing how this fire took, I thought fit the next day that I came to the Bar, to desire that the <hi>Books</hi> of the Coronation of former Kings, especially those of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James,</hi> might be seen and compared, and the Copies brought into the Court, both from the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and such as were in my Study at <hi>Lambeth:</hi> And a fuller Inquisition made into the Business: In regard I was as Innocent from this Crime, as when my Mother bare me into the World. A <hi>Salvo</hi> was entred for me upon this. And every day that I after came to the Bar, I called upon this Business. But somewhat or other was still pretended by them which managed the Evidence, that I could not get the Books to be brought forth, nor any thing to be done, till almost the last day of my Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Then no Books could be found in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> nor in my Study, but only that of <hi>King James;</hi> whereas, when the Keys were taken from me, there were divers Books there, as is confessed in the Printed <hi>Votes</hi> of this Parliament: And one of them with a Watchet <note place="margin">
                           <hi>p.</hi> 706.</note> Sattin Cover, now missing. And whether this of King <hi>James</hi> (had not my Secretary, who knew the Book, seen it drop out of Mr. <hi>Pryn's</hi> Bag) would not have been concealed too, I cannot tell. At last, the Book of King <hi>James</hi> his Coronation, and the other urged against me concerning King <hi>Charles,</hi> were seen and compared openly in the Lords House, and found to be the same Oath in both, and no Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lining or Alteration in the Book charged against me.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>This Business was left by the Serjeant to Mr. <hi>Maynard,</hi> who made the most that could be out of my <hi>Diary</hi> against me. And so did Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> when he came to give the Summ of the Charge against me, both before the <hi>Lords,</hi> and after in the <hi>House of Commons.</hi> And therefore for the avoiding of all tedious Repetition: And for that the Arguments which both used, are the same: And because I hold it not fit to break a Charge of this moment into divers pieces, or put them in different places, I will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:54614:172"/>
down the whole Business together, and the Answer which I then gave.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> in the Summ of the Charge against me in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons-House,</hi> when he came to this Article, said, <hi>he was now come to the Business so much expected.</hi> And I humbly besought that <hi>Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable House,</hi> if it were a Matter of so great Expectation, it might be of as great Attention too, while I should follow that Worthy Gentleman, step after step, and Answer as I went.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. And First, he went about to prove out of my <hi>Diary,</hi> that this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition (<hi>of the King's Prerogative</hi>) to the Oath, was made by me. Thus he says, that <hi>Decemb.</hi> 31. 1625. <hi>I went to Hampton-Court.</hi> That's true. He says, <hi>that there,</hi> Januar. 1. <hi>I understood I was Named with other Bishops, to meet and consider of the Ceremonies about the Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that,</hi> Januar. 4. <hi>we did meet at</hi> White-Hall <hi>accordingly; and that,</hi> Januar. 6. <hi>we gave his Majesty an Answer.</hi> Not I (as 'twas Charged) but We gave <hi>his Majesty</hi> Answer. So if the Oath, had been changed by me, it must have been known to the Committee, and broken forth to my Ruin long since. Then he says, that <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuar.</hi> 16. <hi>I was appointed to serve at the Coronation, in the room of the Dean of</hi> Westminster. That's no Crime; and 'tis added in the <hi>Diary,</hi> that this Charge was delivered unto me by my Predecessor. So he knew that this Service to Attend at the Coronation was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon me. He says next, <hi>that</hi> Januar. 18. <hi>the Duke of</hi> Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham <hi>had me to the King, to shew his Majesty the Notes we had agreed on, if nothing offended him.</hi> These were only Notes of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. And the other Bishops sent me, being Puny, to give the Account. Then he says, <hi>Januar.</hi> 23. <hi>It is in my Diary,</hi> Librum habui paratum, <hi>I had a Book ready.</hi> And it was time, after such meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and the Coronation being to follow <hi>Feb.</hi> 2. and I designed to assist and attend that Service, that I should have a Book ready. The Ceremonies were too long and various to carry them in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. And whereas 'tis urged, <hi>that I prepared and altered this Book;</hi> the words in my <hi>Diary,</hi> are only <hi>Paratum habui,</hi> I had the Book ready for my own use in that Service. Nor can <hi>Paratum ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bui,</hi> signifie preparing or altering the Book. And Thirdly, 'tis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there, That the Book which I had ready in my Hands, did agree <hi>per omnia cum Libro Regali:</hi> And if it did agree in all things with the King's Recorded Book then brought out of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,</hi> where then is the Alteration so laboriously sought to be fastned on me? I humbly beseech you to mark this.</p>
                        <p>Yet out of these Premises put together, Mr. <hi>Brown's</hi> Inference was, <hi>that I made this Alteration of the Oath.</hi> But surely these Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, neither single nor together, can produce any such Conclusion; but rather the contrary. Beside, Inference upon Evidence is not Evidence, unless it be absolutely necessary; which all Men see that here it is not. But I pray observe. Why was such a sudden stay made at <hi>Januar.</hi> 23. whereas it appears in my <hi>Diary</hi> at <hi>Januar.</hi> 31. that the <hi>Bishops</hi> were not alone trusted with this Coronation Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; <hi>Sed alii Proceres,</hi> but <hi>other Great and Noble Men</hi> also. And they did meet that <hi>Januar.</hi> 31. and sate in Council about it. So the <hi>Bishops</hi> Meetings were but Preparatory to ease the Lords, most of
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:54614:172"/>
the Ceremonies being in the Church-way. And then can any Man think, that these great Lords, when they came to review all that was done, would let the Oath be altered by me or any other, so materially, and not check at it? 'Tis impossible.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Secondly, this Gentleman went on to charge this Addition upon me, Thus, <hi>There were found in my Study at</hi> Lambeth <hi>two Books of King</hi> James <hi>his Coronation, one of them had this Clause or Addition in it, and the other had it not; and we cannot tell by which he was Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, therefore it must needs be some wilful Error in me; to make choice of that Book which had this Addition in it; or some great mistake.</hi> First, if it were a mistake only, then it is no Crime. And wilful Error it could not be. For being Named one of them that were to consider of the Ceremonies, I went to my Predecessor, and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Book, to see by it what was formerly done. He delivered me this now in question; I knew not whether he had more or no; nor did I know that any one of them differed from other. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no wilful Error. For I had no choice to make of this Book which had the Addition, before that which had it not; but thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully took that which he gave me. But Secondly, If one Book of King <hi>James</hi> his Coronation, in which I could have no Hand, had this Addition in it, (as is confessed) then was not this a new Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of my making. And Thirdly, it may easily be seen, that King <hi>James</hi> was Crowned by the Book which hath this Addition in it, this being in a fair Carnation Sattin Cover, the other in Paper without a Cover, and unfit for a King's Hand, especially in such a great and publick Solemnity.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. In the Third place he said, <hi>There were in this Book twenty Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations more, and all or most in my Hand.</hi> Be it so, (for I was never suffered to have the Book to consider of) they are confessed not to be material. The Truth is, when we met in the Committee, we were fain to mend many slips of the Pen, to make Sense in some places, and good <hi>English</hi> in other. And the Book being trusted with me, I had Reason to do it with my own Hand, but openly at the Committee all. Yet two Things as Matters of some moment  Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> checked at.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p n="1">1. The one was, <hi>that</hi> Confirm <hi>is changed into</hi> Perform.
<q>
                           <p>If it be so, Perform is the greater and more advantagious to the Subject, because it includes <hi>Execution,</hi> which the other word doth not. Nor doth this word hinder, <hi>but that the Laws and Liberties are the Peoples already.</hi> For though they be their own, yet the <hi>King</hi> by his place, may and ought to perform the keeping and maintaining of them. I say (if it be so) for I was never suffered to have this Book in my Hands thoroughly to peruse: Nor, under favour, do I believe this Alteration is so made, as 'tis urged. [In the Book which I have by me, and was Transcribed from the other, it is <hi>Confirm.</hi>]</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The other is, <hi>that the King is said to Answer,</hi> I will <hi>for</hi> I do: But when will he? Why all the days of his Life; which is much more than I do for the present. So, if this change be made, 'tis still for the Peoples advantage. [And there also 'tis <hi>I do grant.</hi>] And yet again I say (<hi>if</hi>) for the Reason before given. Besides, in all the <hi>Latin</hi> Copies, there is a latitude left for them that are trusted, to add to those
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:54614:173"/>
Interrogatories which are then put to the <hi>King,</hi> any other that is just; In these Words, <hi>Adijciantur praedictis Interrogationibus quae justa fuerint.</hi> And such are these two mentioned, if they were made.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Mr. <hi>Brown's</hi> Fourth and last Objection was, that I made this Alteration of the Oath, <hi>because it agrees</hi> (as he said) <hi>with my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For that in a Paper of Bishop</hi> Harsnett's, <hi>there is a Marginal Note in my Hand, that</hi> Salvo Jure Coronae, <hi>is understood in the Oaths of a King.</hi> But first, there's a great deal of difference between <hi>Jus Regis &amp; Praerogativa,</hi> between the Right and Inheritance of <hi>the King</hi> and his Prerogative, though never so Legal. And with Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and until I shall be convinced herein, I must believe; that no King can Swear himself out of his Native Right. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, If this were, and still be an Error in my Judgment, that's no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument at all to prove Malice in my Will: That because that is my Judgment for <hi>Jus Regis,</hi> therefore I must thrust <hi>Praerogativam Regis,</hi> which is not my Judgment, into a Publick Oath which I had no Power to alter. These were all the Proofs which Mr. <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> at first, and Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> at last, brought against me in this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. And they are all but Conjectural, and the Conjectures weak. But that I did not alter this Oath by adding the <hi>Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> the Proofs I shall bring are Pregnant, and some of them Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary. They are these.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. My Predecessor was one of the Grand Committee for these Ceremonies. That was proved by his Servants to the Lords. Now his known Love to the Publick was such, as that he would never have suffered me or any other, to make such an Alteration. Nor would he have concealed such a Crime in me, loving me so well as he did.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Secondly, 'Tis Notoriously known, that he Crowned <hi>the King,</hi> and Administred the Oath, (which was avowed also before the Lords by his Ancient Servants.) And it cannot be rationally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived he would ever have Administred such an alter'd Oath to <hi>his Majesty.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. Thirdly, 'Tis expressed in <hi>my Diary,</hi> at <hi>Januar.</hi> 31. 1625. (And that must be good Evidence for me, having been so often produced against me,) that divers great Lords were in this Committee for the Ceremonies, and did that Day sit in Council upon them. And can it be thought they would not so much as compare the Books? Or that comparing of them, they would indure an Oath with such an Alteration to be Tender'd to <hi>the King?</hi> Especially, since 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore confessed, that One Copy of King <hi>James</hi> his Coronation had this Alteration in it, and the other had it not.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Fourthly, 'Tis expressed in my <hi>Diary,</hi> and made use of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, at <hi>Januar.</hi> 23. 1625. That this Book urged against me did agree <hi>per Omnia cum Libro Regali,</hi> in all things with the <hi>King's</hi> Book brought out of the <hi>Exchequer.</hi> And if the Book that I then had, and is now insisted upon, did agree with that Book which came out of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and that in all things, how is it possible I should make this Alteration?</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Fifthly, with much Labour I got the Books to be compared in the Lords House; That of King <hi>James</hi> his Coronation, and this
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:54614:173"/>
of King <hi>Charles.</hi> And they were found to agree in all things to a Syllable. Therefore 'tis impossible this should be added by me. And this I conceive cuts off all Conjectural Proofs to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                           <p>Lastly, In the Printed Book of the <hi>Votes</hi> of this present Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>p.</hi> 706.</note> it is acknowledged, that the Oath given to King <hi>James</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> was the same. The same. Therefore unaltered. And this Passage of that Book I then shewed the Lords in my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. To this Mr. <hi>Maynard</hi> then replyed. That the <hi>Votes</hi> there mentioned, <hi>were upon the Word</hi> Elegerit, <hi>and the doubt whether it should be,</hi> hath chosen, <hi>or</hi> shall chuse. I might not then Answer to the Reply, but the Answer is plain. For, be the occasion which led on the Votes, what it will; as long as the Oath is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the same, 'tis manifest it could not be altered by me. And I doubt not, but these Reasons will give this Honourable House Satisfaction, that I added not this Particular of the <hi>Prerogative</hi> to the Oath.</p>
                           <p>Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> in his last Reply, passed over the other Arguments I know not how. But against this, he took Exception. He brought the Book with him, and Read the Passage. And said (as far as I remember) <hi>that the Votes had Relation to the Word</hi> Chuse, <hi>and not to this Alteration.</hi> Which is in Effect the same which Mr. <hi>Maynard</hi> urged before. I might not Reply by the Course of the Court, but I have again considered of that Passage, and find it plain. Thus, <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>p.</hi> 706.</note> First they say: They have considered <hi>of all the Alterations in the Form of this Oath which they can find.</hi> Therefore of this Alteration also, if any such were: Then they say, <hi>Excepting that Oath which was taken by his Majesty and his Father King</hi> James. There it is confessed, that the Oath taken by them, was one and the same, called there <hi>That Oath, which</hi> was taken by both. Where falls the Exception then? For 'tis said, <hi>Excepting that Oath,</hi> &amp;c. why it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>Excepting that the Word</hi> Chuse <hi>is wholly left out, as well</hi> hath Chosen <hi>as</hi> will Chuse. Which is a most manifest and evident Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, that the Oath of King <hi>James</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> was the same in all things, to the very leaving out of the Word <hi>Chuse.</hi> Therefore it was the same Oath all along. No difference at all. For <hi>Exceptio firmat Regulam in non Exceptis;</hi> and here's no Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all of this Clause of the Prerogative. Therefore the Oath of both the Kings was the same in that, or else the Votes would have been sure to mention it. Where it may be observed too, that <hi>Serjeant Wilde,</hi> though he knew these Votes, and was present both at the Debate and the Voting; and so must know that the Word <hi>Chuse,</hi> was omitted in both the Oaths, yet at the first he Charged it eagerly upon me, that I had left this Clause of <hi>Chusing</hi> out of King <hi>Charles</hi> his Oath, and added the other. God forgive him. But the World may see by this, and some other Passages, with what Art my Life was sought for.</p>
                           <p>And yet before I quite leave this Oath, I may say 'tis not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together improbable, that this Clause (<hi>And agreeing to the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the King's thereof</hi>) was added to the Oath in <hi>Edward</hi> 6. or Queen <hi>Elizabeth's time:</hi> And hath no Relation at all to <hi>the Laws of</hi>
                              <pb n="324" facs="tcp:54614:174"/>
                              <hi>this Kingdom,</hi> absolutely mentioned before in the beginning of this Oath; But only to the Words [<hi>The Profession of the Gospel Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Kingdom,</hi>] And then immediately follows, <hi>And agreeing to the Prerogative of the Kings thereof.</hi> By which the King Swears to maintain his Prerogative, according to God's Law, and the Gospel Established, against all foreign Claims and Jurisdictions whatsoever. And if this be the meaning, he that made the Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, whoever it were (for I did it not) deserves Thanks for it,  and not the Reward of a Traytor.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now to return to the Day. The Fourth Charge went on <note place="margin">IV.</note> with the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> still. But Mr. <hi>Serjeant</hi> was very nimble. For he leaped from the Coronation at <hi>Westminster,</hi> to see what I did at <hi>Oxford.</hi> 1. There the first Witness is Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent.</hi> And he says, <hi>The standing of the Communion-Table at St.</hi> Mary's <hi>was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</hi> I have answered to this Situation of the Communion-Table already. And if it be lawful in one place, 'tis in another. For the Chappel of <hi>Magdalen College,</hi> and <hi>Christ-Church</hi> Quire, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses he knows of no Direction given by me to either: Nor doth he know, whether I reproved the things there done or no. So all this is no Evidence. For the Picture of the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> at St. <hi>Mary's</hi> Door, as I knew nothing of it till it was done, so never did I hear any Abuse or Dislike of it after it was done. And here Sir <hi>Nathaniel</hi> confesses too, that he knows not of any Adoration of it, as Men passed the Streets or otherwise. When this Witness came not home, they urged the Statute of <hi>Merton College,</hi> or the <hi>Vniversity,</hi> where (if I took my Notes right) they say, <hi>I enjoyned Debitam</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">

                        <hi>Reverentiam.</hi> And as I know no fault in that Injunction, or Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute; so neither do I know what due Bodily Reverence can be given to God in his Church, without some Bowing or Genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Second Witness was Mr. <hi>Corbett.</hi> He says, <hi>that when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Reverence was required by my Visitors <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> one of my Articles, he gave Reasons against it, but Sir</hi> Jo. Lambe <hi>urged it still.</hi> First, my Lords, if Mr. <hi>Corbett's</hi> Reasons were sufficient, Sir <hi>Jo. Lambe</hi> was to blame in that; but Sir <hi>Jo. Lambe</hi> must answer it, and not I. Secondly, it may be observed, that this Man, by his own Confession, gave Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons (such as they were) against due Reverence to God in his own House. He says, that <hi>Dr.</hi> Frewen <hi>told him from me, That I wished he should do as others did at St.</hi> Mary's, <hi>or let another Execute his place as Proctor.</hi> This is but a Hearsay from Dr. <hi>Frewen,</hi> who being at <hi>Oxford,</hi> I cannot produce him. And if I had sent such a Message, I know no Crime in it. He says, <hi>that after this, he desired he might enjoy in this Particular the Liberty which the King and the Church of</hi> England <hi>gave him.</hi> He did so: And from that Day he heard no more of it, but enjoyed the Liberty which he asked. He says, <hi>Mr.</hi>

                        </note> Channell <hi>desired the same Liberty as well as he.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Channell</hi> had it granted as well as he. He confesses ingenuously, that the Bowing required, was only <hi>Toward,</hi> not <hi>to</hi> the Altar. And <note n="*" place="margin">And the third Witness agrees in this.</note> 
                        <hi>To the Picture at St.</hi> Mary's <hi>Door,</hi> he says, he never heard of any Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence done to it: And doth <hi>believe that all that was done at</hi> Christ-Church,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:54614:174"/>
                        <hi>was since my Time.</hi> But it must be his Knowledge, not his Belief, that must make an Evidence.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Third Witness, was one Mr. <hi>Bendye.</hi> He says, <hi>There was a Crucifix in</hi> Lincoln College <hi>Chappel since my time.</hi> If there be, 'tis more than I know. My Lord of <hi>York</hi> that now is, when he was Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> worthily bestowed much Cost upon that Chappel, and if he did set up a Crucifix, I think it was before I had ought to do there. He says, <hi>there was Bowing at the Name of</hi> Jesus. And God forbid but there should; and the <hi>Canon</hi> of the Church requires <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Can.</hi>

                           </gap>.</note> it. He says, <hi>there were</hi> Latin <hi>Prayers in</hi> Lent, <hi>but he knows not who injoyned it.</hi> And then he might have held his Peace. But there were <hi>Latin</hi> Sermons, and Prayers on <hi>Ash-Wednesday,</hi> when few came to Church, but the <hi>Lent</hi> Proceeders, who understood them. And in divers Colleges they have their Morning-Prayers in <hi>Latin,</hi> and had so, long before I knew the University. The last Thing he says, was, <hi>That there were Copes used in some Colleges, and that a Traveller should say, upon the sight of them, that he saw just such a thing upon the</hi> Pope's <hi>Back.</hi> This Wise Man might have said as much of a Gown: He saw a Gown on the <hi>Pope's</hi> Back; therefore a <hi>Protestant</hi> may not wear one: or entring into S. <hi>Pauls,</hi> he may cry, Down with it; for I saw the <hi>Pope</hi> in just such another Church in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Then was urged the conclusion of a Letter of mine sent to that <hi>Vniversity.</hi> The Words were to this Effect, <hi>I desire you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me a Sinner, Quoties coram <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

In which Desire of mine, or Expression of it, I can yet see no Offence. No, nor in <hi>coram Altare,</hi> their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnest time of Prayer being at the Communion.
<q>
                           <p>Here Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> Aggravated the things done in that University: And fell upon the Titles given me in some Letters from thence; but because I have answered those Titles already, I refer the Reader thither, and shall not make here any tedious Repetition: Only this I shall add; That in the Civil Law 'tis frequent to be seen, that not Bishops only one to another, but the great Emperours of the World have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly given that Title of <hi>Sanctitas vestra,</hi> to Bishops of meaner place than my self; to say no more. But here Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> in his last Reply, was pleased to say, <hi>This Title was not given to any Bishop of England.</hi> First, if I had my Books about me, perhaps this might be refuted. Secondly, why should so Grave a Man as he so much Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparage his own Nation? Is it impossible (be my Unworthiness what it will) for an <hi>English</hi> Bishop to deserve as good a Title as another? Thirdly, be that as it may, if it were (as certainly it was) Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully given to other Bishops, though they not <hi>English,</hi> then is it neither <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> nor <hi>Assumption of Papal Power,</hi> as was Charged  upon it.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Oxford</hi> Mr. Serjeant went to <hi>Cambridge.</hi> And I must be <note place="margin">V.</note> Guilty, if ought were amiss there too. For this Fifth Charge were produced three Witnesses, Mr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> Mr. <hi>Greece,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Seaman.</hi> Their Testimonies agreed very near: So I will answer them together. First, they say, <hi>That at</hi> Peter-House <hi>there were Copes and Candlesticks,</hi>
                        <pb n="326" facs="tcp:54614:175"/>
                        <hi>and Pictures in the Glass-Windows; and the like.</hi> But these things I have often answered already, and shall not repeat. They say, <hi>the Chief Authors of these things, were Dr.</hi> Wren <hi>and Dr.</hi> Cosens. They are both living, why are they not called to answer their own Acts? For here's yet no shew of Proof to bring any thing home to me. For no one of them says, that I gave direction for any of these. No, <hi>(says Mr. Serjeant)</hi> but <hi>why did I tolerate them?</hi> First, no Man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to me. Secondly, I was not Chancellor, and endured no small Envy for any little thing that I had occasion to look upon in that place. And thirdly, this was not the least Cause, why I followed my Right for Power to visit there. And though that Power was confirmed to me, yet the Times have been such as that I did not then think fit to use it. It would have but heaped more Envy on me, who bare too much already.
<q>
                           <p>As for Mr. <hi>Greece,</hi> who hath laboured much against me in all this Business, God forgive him; and while he Inherits his Father's ill Affections to  me, God preserve him from his Father's End.</p>

                     <p>From <hi>Cambridge</hi> he went to the <hi>Cathedrals,</hi> and first to <hi>Canterbury.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">VI.</note> Here the Charge is <hi>Bowing versus Altare;</hi> the two Witnesses, two Prebendaries of that Church, Dr: <hi>Jackson,</hi> and Dr: <hi>Blechenden.</hi> And first, Dr: <hi>Jackson</hi> says, the <hi>Bowing was versus Altare:</hi> So not <hi>to,</hi> but <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Altar; and Dr: <hi>Blechenden</hi> says, it was the Adoration of the High Majesty of God, to whom, if no Altar were there, I should Bow. Dr: <hi>Jackson</hi> says, <hi>this Bowing was to his Grief.</hi> Strange! I avow to your Lordships and the World, no Man did so much approve all my Proceedings in that Church, as he: And for this Particular, he never found the least fault with it to me; and if he conceal his Grief, I cannot ease it. He says, <hi>this Bowing was not in use till within this Six or Seven Years.</hi> Sure the Old Man's Memory fails him. For Dr. <hi>Blechenden</hi> says, <hi>the Communion-Table was railed about, and Bowings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, when he came first to be a Member of that Church; and saith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Oath that's above Ten Years ago. And that it was practised before their new Statutes were made; and that in those Statutes no Punishment is infticted for the Breach, or not Performance of this Reverence.</hi> I could tell your Lordships how often Dr: <hi>Jackson</hi> hath shifted his Opinions in Religion, but that they tell me their Witnesses must not be Scandalized. As for the Statutes, my Secretary Mr: <hi>Dell,</hi> who co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied them out, testified here to <hi>the Lords,</hi> that I left out divers Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions which were in the Old Book, and Ordained many Sermons in their rooms.</p>
                     <p>The next Cathedral he instanced in was <hi>Winchester.</hi> But there's nothing but the old Objections, <hi>Copes.</hi> And the wearing of them is warranted by the Canon; and <hi>Reverence at coming in, and going out of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Can.</hi> 24.</note> 
                        <hi>the Church.</hi> And that, great Kings have not (in better Ages) thought much to do. And they did well to instance in the <hi>College of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> as well as the <hi>Church;</hi> for 'tis confessed, the Injunction sent thither requires, that <hi>the Reverence used be such as is not dissonant from the Church of</hi> England. So, this may be a Comment to the other Injunctions.
<q>
                           <p>But for the Copes in Cathedrals, Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> in his last Reply was not satisfied. For he said, <hi>the Canon mentioned but the wearing of one Cope.</hi> Be it so: But they must have that before they
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:54614:175"/>
can wear it. And if the Canon enjoyn the wearing of one, my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction might require the providing and using of one. Besides, if there be no Popery, no introduction to Superstition in the having or using of one; then certainly, there can be none in the having of more for the same use: The Superstition being lodged in the  misuse, not in the number.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>From the Cathedrals, Mr. <hi>Serjeant</hi> went to view some Parish-Churches. <note place="margin">VII.</note> And First, 'tis Charged, <hi>That in a Parish-Church at</hi> Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester <hi>two Seats were removed to make way for Rayling in of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion-Table.</hi> But for ought I know, this might have been concealed. For it was liked so well, that they to whom the Seats belonged, removed them at their own Charges, that the other might be done.</p>
                     <p>The next instance was in St: <hi>Gregory's</hi> Church, by S: <hi>Pauls.</hi> The Charge was, <hi>the Placing of the Communion-Table Altar-wise.</hi> To the Charge it self Answer is given before. The Particulars which are new are these: The Witness Mr: <hi>Wyan.</hi> He says, <hi>the Order for such placing of the Table was from the Dean and Chapter of</hi> S: Pauls. And S: <hi>Gregory's</hi> is in their peculiar Jurisdiction. So the <hi>Holy-Table</hi> was there placed by the Ordinary, not by me. He says next, <hi>That the Parishioners appealed to</hi> the Arches, <hi>but received an Order to Command them and the Cause to the</hi> Council <hi>Board: That it was a full Board when the Cause was heard, and his Majesty present: And that there I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the</hi> Queens <hi>Injunction, about placing the Communion-Table.</hi> In <note place="margin">Q. Eliz. Injunct. Fine.</note> all this, here's nothing Charged upon me, but maintenance of the Injunction: And I had been much to blame if I should not have maintained it. He says, Sir <hi>Henry Martin came and saw it, and said it would make a good Court Cupboard.</hi> If Sir <hi>Henry</hi> did say so, the Scorn ill became either his Age, or Profession; though a <hi>Court Cupboard</hi> be somewhat a better Phrase than a <hi>Dresser.</hi> God forgive them who have in Print called it so. He says, <hi>That hereupon I did say, that he which spake that, had a Stigmatical</hi> Puritan <hi>in his Bosom.</hi> This Man's Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry serves him long for Words: This was many Years since; and if I did speak any thing sounding this way, 'tis more like I should say <hi>Schismatical,</hi> than <hi>Stigmatical Puritan.</hi> But let him look to his Oath; and which Word soever I used, if Sir <hi>Henry</hi> used the one, he might well hear the other. For a prophane Speech it was, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle becoming a <hi>Dean of the Arches.</hi> He says, <hi>that soon after this, Sir</hi> Henry <hi>was put out of his Place.</hi> Not very soon after this; for I was at the time of this Business (as far as I remember) Bishop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and had nothing to do with the disposing of his Place. After, when I came to be <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> I found his Patent was void, neither could Sir <hi>Henry</hi> himself deny it. And being void, and in my Gift, I gave it to another.</p>
                     <p>He says farther, <hi>That it was urged that this way of Placing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Table was against the Word of God, in Bishop</hi> Jewel, <hi>and Mr:</hi> Fox <hi>his Judgment; and that I replied, it were better they should not have these Books in Churches, than so to abuse them.</hi> First, for ought I yet know (and in these straights of time the Books I cannot come at) their Judgment, rightly understood, is not so. Secondly, Though these two were very worthy Men in their Time, yet every thing which they say is not by and by <hi>the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:54614:176"/>
And I may upon good reason depart from their Judgment in some Particulars, and yet not differ from <hi>the Church of England.</hi> As in this very Particular, the Injunction for placing of the Table so, is the Act of <hi>the Queen</hi> and <hi>the Church of England.</hi> And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve <hi>the Queen,</hi> then upon the Act of Reformation, would not have enjoyned it, nor the <hi>Church</hi> obeyed it, had it been against the Word of God. Thirdly, if I did say, <hi>That if they could make no better use of</hi> Jewel <hi>and the</hi> Book of Martyrs, <hi>it were better they had them not in the Churches.</hi> They gave too great occasion for the Speech: For they had picked divers things out of those Books which they could not master, and with them distempered both themselves and their Neighbours. And yet in hope other more Modest Men might make better use of them, I never gave Counsel to have those Books remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (nor is that so much as Charged) but said only thus, That if no better use would be made of them, then that last Remedy; but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver till then.
<q>
                           <p>This last Passage Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> insisted upon: <hi>The taking of good Books from the People.</hi> But as I have answered, there was no such thing done, or intended; only a Word spoken to make bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie Men see how they abused themselves and the Church, by mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understanding and misapplying that which was written for the  good of both.</p>
                        </q>
Lastly, <hi>it was urged,</hi> He said, <hi>that the Communion-Table must stand Altarwise, that Strangers which come and look into these Churches, might not see such a Disproportion: The Holy Table standing one way in the Mother-Church, and quite otherwise in the Parochial an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed.</hi> And truly, to see this, could be no Commendation of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline of <hi>the Church of England.</hi> But howsoever, Mr. <hi>Clarke</hi> (the other Witness with <hi>Wyan,</hi> and agreeing with him in the most) says plainly that it was the Lord of <hi>Arundel</hi> that spake this, not I: And that he was seconded in it by the Lord <hi>Weston,</hi> then Lord Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, not by me.</p>
                     <p>The last Charge of this Day was a passage out of one Mr: <hi>Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">VIII.</note> Book, <hi>p.</hi> 20, 21. <hi>That they must take the Reverend Prelates for their Examples,</hi> &amp;c. And Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> Witnessed, <hi>the like was in the Missal, p.</hi> 256. Mr. <hi>Shelford</hi> is a meer Stranger to me; his Book I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read; if he have said any thing Unjust or Untrue; let him answer for himself. As for the like to that, which he says, being in <hi>the Missal,</hi> though that be but a weak Argument, yet let him salve it.</p>
                     <p>Here this Day ending, I was put off to <hi>Saturday, June</hi> 1. And <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Junii</hi> 1.</note> then again put off to <hi>Thursday, June</hi> 6. which held. <note place="margin">

                        <hi>CAP. XXXIV.</hi> My Twelfth Day of Hearing.</head>
                     <p>THis Day Serjeant <hi>Wild,</hi> instead of beginning with a new Charge, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Thursday, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                           </hi> 6. 1644.</note> made another long Reply to my Answers of the former Day. Whether he found that his former Reply made at the time, was <note place="margin">Die Duode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimo.</note> weak, and so reputed, I cannot tell.
<q>
                           <p>But another he made, as full of premeditated Weakness, as the former was of sudden. Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> I think perceived it, and was often at his Ear; but Mr. <hi>Serjeant</hi>  was little less than angry, and would on.</p>
                        </q>
I knew I was to make no Answer to any Reply, and so took no Notes: Indeed, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it all as it was, that is, either nothing, or nothing to the purpose. This tedious Reply ended;</p>
                     <p>Then came on the First Charge about the Window of Coloured <note place="margin">I.</note> Glass set up in the New Chappel at <hi>Westminster.</hi> It was the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the coming down of the <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi> upon the <hi>Apostles.</hi> This was Charged to be done by me, and at my Cost: The Witnesses, Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> imployed in setting up the Window, and Mr: <hi>Sutton</hi> the Glasier.</p>
                     <p>These Men <hi>say, that Dr:</hi> Newell, <hi>Sub-Dean of</hi> Westminster, <hi>gave Order for the Window and the setting of it up; but they know not at whose Cost, nor was any Order given from me.</hi> So here's nothing Charged upon me. And if it were, I know nothing amiss in the Window. <hi>As for the</hi> Kings Arms <hi>being taken down</hi> (as they say) Let them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer that did it. Though I believe, that the <hi>King's Arms</hi> standing alone in a white Window, was not taken down out of any ill mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but only out of necessity to make way for the History.</p>
                     <p>The Second Charge was the Picture of the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> set upon <note place="margin">II.</note> a New-Built Door at S: <hi>Marys</hi> in <hi>Oxford.</hi> Here <hi>Alderman Nixon</hi> says, <hi>That some Passengers put off their Hats, and, as he supposes, to that Picture.</hi> But, <hi>my Lords,</hi> his Supposal is no Proof. He says, <hi>that the next day he saw it.</hi> But what did he see? Nothing, but the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the Hat; For he could not see why, or to what; unless they which put off, told it. They might put off to some Acquaintance that passed by. He farther says, <hi>he saw a Man in that Porch upon his Knees, and he thinks praying; but he cannot say to that.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>But then (if the Malice he hath long born me, would have suffer'd him) </p>
                        </q>
he might have stayed till he knew to whom he was Praying, for till then 'tis no Evidence. He says, <hi>he thinks that I Countenanced the setting of it up, because it was done by Bishop</hi> Owen. But Mr: <hi>Bromfeeld,</hi> who did that Work, gave Testimony to the Lords, that I had nothing to do in it. He says, <hi>there was an Image set up at</hi> Carfax <hi>Church, but pulled down again by Mr:</hi> Widdows, <hi>Vicar there.</hi> But this hath no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation at all to me.
<q>
                           <p>This Picture of the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> was twice mentioned before. And Sir <hi>Nath: Brent</hi> could say nothing to it but Hearsay. And Mr: <hi>Corbet</hi> did not so much as hear of any Abuse. And now <hi>Alderman Nixon</hi> says, he saw Hats put off; but the wise
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:54614:177"/>
Man knows not to what. Nor is there any shew of Proof offer'd, that I had any Hand or Approbation in the setting of it up. Or that ever any Complaint was made to me of any Abuse to it, or dislike of it. And yet Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> when he gave the Summ of the Charge against me, insisted upon this also, as some great Fault of  mine, which I cannot yet see.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the next Charge, Mr. <hi>Serjeant</hi> is gone back again to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">III.</note> as in the former to <hi>Oxford.</hi> The Witnesses are Mrs. <hi>Charnock,</hi> and her Daughter. They say, they went (being at Court) into the Chappel, and it seems a Woman with them, that was a <hi>Papist:</hi> And that <hi>while they were there, Dr.</hi> Brown, <hi>one of the King's Chaplains came in, Bowed toward the Communion-Table, and then at the Altar kneeled down to his Prayers.</hi> I do not know of any Fault Dr. <hi>Brown</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, either in doing Reverence to God, or Praying, and there. And yet if he had committed any Fault, I hope I shall not answer for him. I was not then <hi>Dean</hi> of the Chappel, nor did any ever complain to me. They say, <hi>that two Strangers came into the Chappel at the same time, and saw what Dr.</hi> Brown <hi>did, and said thereupon, that sure we did not differ much, and should be of one Religion shortly. And that the Woman which was with these Witnesses, told them they were Priests.</hi> First, this can no way Relate to me; for neither did these Women complain to me of it, nor any from them. Secondly, if these two Men were Priests, and did say, as is Testified; are we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a whit the nearer them in Religion? Indeed, if all the difference between <hi>Rome</hi> and us, consisted in outward Reverence, and no Points of Doctrine, some Argument might hence be drawn; but the Points of Doctrine being so many and great, put stop enough to that. Thirdly, if Recusants, Priests especially, did so speak, might it not be said in Cunning to Discountenance all External Worship in the Service of God, that so they may have opportunity to make more Proselytes? And 'tis no small Advantage, to my knowledge, which they have this way made.
<q>
                           <p>And this was the Answer which I gave Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> when he Charged this upon me in the <hi>House of  Commons.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here, before they went any farther, Mr. <hi>Serjeant Wilde</hi> told the Lords, that when Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent</hi> was imployed in my Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>he had Instructions for particular Churches, of which some were Tacit Intimations, and some Express.</hi> I know not to what end this was spoken; for no Coherent Charge followed upon it. But sure, he thinks Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent</hi> very skilful in me, that he can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand my <hi>Tacit Intimations,</hi> and know to what Particular Church to apply them.
<q>
                           <p>And as I said no more at the Bar, so neither did I think to say any more after; yet now I cannot but a little bemoan my self. For ever since Mr. <hi>Maynard</hi> left off, who Pleaded, though strongly, yet fairly, against me, I have been in very ill Condition between the other two. For from Mr. <hi>Nicolas,</hi> I had some Sense, but extream virulent and foul Language. And from Serjeant <hi>Wilde,</hi> Language good enough sometimes, but little or no Sense. For let me answer what I would, when he came to Reply, he repeated the Charge again, as if I had made no Answer at all. Or as if all that I <hi>Expressed</hi> never so plainly, had been but <hi>Tacit</hi>
                              <pb n="331" facs="tcp:54614:177"/>
                              <hi>Intimations;</hi> which I think he understood as much as Sir <hi>Nathaniel  Brent</hi>
                           </p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Fourth Charge, he told <hi>the Lords</hi> he would not trouble <note place="margin">IV.</note> them with repeating the Evidence, but only put them in mind of some things in the Case of <hi>Ferdinando Adams,</hi> of <hi>Ipswich:</hi> Of the Men of <hi>Lewis</hi> suffering in the <hi>High-Commission:</hi> Of the Parishioners of <hi>Beckington,</hi> and some others heard before, but would leave <hi>the Lords</hi> to their Memory and their Notes. Yet read over the Sentences given in the <hi>High-Commission,</hi> and made a Repetition of whatsoever might but make a shew to render me odious to the People.
<q>
                           <p>And this hath been their Art all along, to run over the same thing twice and again (as they did here in the second Charge about the Picture of the <hi>Blessed Virgin:</hi>) To the end, that as the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors changed, the more of them might hear it; and that which wrought not upon some, might upon others. In all which I pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently referred my self to my former Answers, having no other way to help my self; in regard they pretended that they renewed the same Instances, but not the same way; but in one place, as against <hi>Law;</hi> and in another, as against <hi>Religion.</hi> But why then did they in both places run over all Circumstances appliable to  both?</p>
                        </q>
And on they went too with the Men <hi>of Lewis,</hi> where one <note place="margin">1.</note> Mr. <hi>Parnlye</hi> (they say) <hi>was Censured cruelly in</hi> the High-Commission, <hi>for not removing the Communion-Table.</hi> The Business was but this. Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent,</hi> and his own Ordinary, Dr. <hi>Nevill,</hi> Ordered the remove of the Table: He would not. For this Contumacy he was Censured, but injoyned only to make his Submission to Dr. <hi>Nevill.</hi> Which I think was a Sentence far from any Barbarous Cruelty, as 'tis called.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another Instance, and the next, was Mr. <hi>Burket.</hi> He says, <hi>he was Censured also about removing the Communion-Table, and for that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> But first, this was not simply for removing the <hi>Holy-Table;</hi> but it was for abetting the Church-Wardens to remove it back again from the place, where lawful Authority had set it. And secondly, whereas he says, <hi>he was Censured for this only;</hi> the very Charge it self confutes him. For there 'tis said, that this, about removing of the Communion-Table, appears <hi>in the Sixth Article</hi> that was against him. Therefore there were Five other Articles at least more against him. And therefore not this only.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Third Instance was in Mr. <hi>Chancye:</hi> And he likewise is said <hi>to have suffered very much only about Railing in of the Communion-Table.</hi> But this is not so neither. For he confesses that he spake Reproachful Words against Authority, and in Contempt of <hi>his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.</hi> That he said, the Rails were fit to be set up in his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. That he came Fifty Miles from his own Church, on purpose to Countenance this Business. And all this he acknowledges upon his Oath in his Submission. And yet nothing laid upon him but Suspension, and that no longer than till he submitted. And all this the Act of the <hi>High-Commission,</hi> not mine.
<q>
                           <p>And so I answered Mr.  <hi>Brown,</hi> who urged this against me also.</p>
                        </q>
And the Truth of all this appears <hi>apud Acta;</hi> though they were taken away, and kept ever since from my use, yet many things done in that Court, have
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:54614:178"/>
been Charged against me. And here stepped in a Testimony of Mr. <hi>Genebrards,</hi> That <hi>I threatned openly in the</hi> High-Commission <hi>to suspend Dr.</hi> Merrick. And why might I not do it, if he will be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-bold with the Proceeding of the whole Court? I have known e're now, a very good Lawyer Committed from the <hi>Chancery Bar</hi> to <hi>the Fleet.</hi> Though I shall spare Names.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The fourth Instance was in Mr. <hi>Workman's</hi> Case: Charged as if he were Sentenced <hi>only for Preaching a Sermon to the Judges, against Images in Churches.</hi> 1. The first Witness in the Cause was Mr. <hi>Langly:</hi> He says, <hi>Mr.</hi> Workman <hi>was Censured for this Sermon, and other things.</hi> Therefore not for this Sermon only: The High-Commissioners were no such Patrons of Images. He says, <hi>that when I was Dean of</hi> Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester, <hi>I told them in the Chappel, that King</hi> James <hi>had heard of many things amiss in that Church, and required me to take care of them.</hi> 'Tis true, he did so. He says farther, <hi>that hereupon I placed the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion-Table Altar-wise, and Commanded due Reverence at the coming into the Church.</hi> This I did, and I have given my Reason often already for it, out of the Injunctions of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> He says, <hi>that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> Smith <hi>took offence at this, and would come no more to the Cathedral.</hi> First, my Lords, this Gentleman was then Schoolmaster there, and had free Access unto me: He never discovered this. Secondly, the Bishop himself never said a word to me about it: If he had, I would either have satisfied his Lordship in that, or any thing else that I did: Or if he had satisfied me, I would have forborn it: He says, <hi>that Mr.</hi> Workman, <hi>after he was put from his Lecture, was not suffered to teach Children.</hi> First, if he had been suffered, this Man had been like to make the first Complaint for decay of his own School. But secondly, The <hi>Commission</hi> thought it no way fit to trust him with the Education of Children, who had been Factious among Men. Especially not in that place, where he had so shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
<q>
                           <p>And this Answer I gave to Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> who in Summing the Evidence stood as much, and inveighed as earnestly against this Cruel proceeding with Mr. <hi>Workman,</hi> as upon any one thing in the Charge. At which time he added also, <hi>that he would not be suffered to Practise Physick to get his Living.</hi> But First, no Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness Evidenceth this, that he was denied to Practise Physick. And Secondly, he might have taught a School, or Practised Physick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where else. But he had done so much Harm, and made such a Faction in <hi>Gloucester,</hi> as that the <hi>High Commission</hi> thought it not fit to continue him there; and he was not willing to go from  thence, where he had made his Party.</p>
                        </q>
He says farther, <hi>that some few of the Citizens of</hi> Gloucester <hi>were called into the</hi> High-Commission, <hi>for an Annuity of Twenty Pound a Year allowed Mr.</hi> Workman, <hi>out of the Town-Stock.</hi> For the thing it self, it was a Gross Abuse and Scorn put upon that Court; that when they had Censured a Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Lecturer (for such he was there proved) the Towns-Men should make him an allowance of Twenty Pound a Year. A thing (as I humbly conceive) not fit to be indured in any settled Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And whereas Clamour is made, that some few of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens were called to an account for it, that's as strange on the other side. For where there are many Offenders, the Noise would be too
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:54614:178"/>
great to call all. And yet here's Noise enough made for calling a few. Here it was replyed by Mr. <hi>Maynard,</hi> That <hi>this was done by that Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and yet a few singled out to Answer; and that therefore I might be singled out to Answer for things done in the High-Commission.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>But, under Favour, this Learned and Worthy Gentleman is mistaken. For here the Mayor and Magistrates of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> did that which was no way warrantable by their Charter, in which Case they may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, all or some: But in the <hi>High-Commission</hi> we medled with no Cause not Cognoscible there; or if by Misinformation we did, we were sure of a Prohibition to stop us. And medling with nothing but things proper to them, I conceive still, no one Man can be singled out to suffer for that which was done by all. And this may serve to Answer Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> also, who in his last  Reply upon me, when I might not Answer, made use of it:</p>
                        </q>

If this were true, I know no Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in it, to desire that such an Affront to Government might be more thoroughly Examined than the <hi>Lords</hi> had leisure to do. But the Witness doth not give this in Evidence. For he says no more, than <hi>that he heard so from Mr.</hi> Brewster. And his Hear-say is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction. He says farther, <hi>that the</hi> High-Commission <hi>called upon this Business of the Annuity, as informed that the Twenty Pound given to Mr.</hi> Workman, <hi>was taken out of the Moneys for the Poor.</hi> And this I must still think was a good and a sufficient ground, justly to call them in question. He says also, <hi>That these Men were Fined, because that which they did was against Authority.</hi> So by their own Witness it appears, that they were not Fined simply for allowing Means to Mr. <hi>Workman,</hi> but for doing it in opposition to Authority. Lastly, he says, <hi>they were Fined Ten Pound apiece, and that presently taken off again.</hi> So here was no such great Persecution as is made in the Cause. And <hi>for the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling of this Deed of the Annuity,</hi> it was done by themselves, as Mr. <hi>Langlye</hi> Witnesses.</p>
                     <p>After these two Witnesses heard, the Sentence of the <hi>High-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission-Court</hi> was read, which I could not have come at, had not they produced it. And by that it appeared evidently, that Mr: <hi>Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was Censured, as well for other things as for his Sermon about Images in Churches. As first, he said, <hi>so many Paces in Dancing were so many to Hell.</hi> This was hard, if he meant the Measures in the <hi>Inns of Court</hi> at <hi>Christmas;</hi> and he excepted none. Then he said, and was no way able to prove it; <hi>that Drunkards, so they were Conformable, were preferred.</hi> Which was a great and a notorious Slander upon the Governours of the Church, and upon Orderly and Conformable Men. Then he said, <hi>that Election of Ministers was in the People.</hi> And this is directly against the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> in the Right of all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons. Then constantly in his Prayer before his Sermon, <hi>he Prayed for the</hi> States <hi>and the King of</hi> Sweden, <hi>before his Majesty,</hi> which was the Garb of that time, among that Party of Men. Then, <hi>that one of his common Themes of Preaching to the People, was against the Government of the Church.</hi> And then, <hi>that Images in Churches, were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And therefore Mr. <hi>Workman</hi> should not have compared their setting up, to Stews, till he could have proved them Worshipped. And in all this, were the Act good or bad in the Censuring of him, it was the Act of the <hi>High-Commission,</hi> not mine.</p>
                     <p>After this followed the Fifth Charge, which was Mr: <hi>Sherfeild's</hi>

The First <note place="margin">1.</note> was Mr: <hi>Carill.</hi> He said that Mr: <hi>Sherfeild defaced this Window, because there was an Image in it, conceived to be the Picture of God the Father.</hi> But first, this comes not home. For many a Picture may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be of God the Father, which yet is not, nor was ever made for it. And then suppose it were so, yet Mr: <hi>Sherfeild</hi> in a setled Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a State, ought not to have done it, but by Command of Authority. He says, that in my Speech there in the Court, I justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the having of the Picture of God the Father, as he remembers, out of <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 22. This (as he remembers) came well in. For I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver justified the making or having that Picture.

He might have been as wary as Mr. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril,</hi> and added (<hi>as he remembers;</hi>) For so many Years since, as this Hearing was, he may easily mistake. But if I did say any such thing; why are not my own Papers here produced against me? I had that written which I then spake, and the Paper was in my Study with the rest, and came (for ought I know) into their Hands which follow the Charge against me. I ask again, why is not this Paper produced? Out of all doubt it would, had there appeared any such thing in it. He says also, that <hi>I said then, that if the Idol of</hi> Jupiter

Authority to do this from the Vestry.</hi> If he had, that's as good as none; for by the Laws of <hi>England</hi> there is yet no power given them for that or any thing else. And all that Vestries do, is by usurpation or consent of the Parish, but reaches not this.

                     <p>Here, as if these Witnesses had not said enough, Mr: <hi>Nicolas</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himself to be a Witness. And told the <hi>Lords</hi> he was present at the Hearing of this Cause, <hi>and that four Witnesses came in clear, that the Picture broken down, was the Picture of God the Father, and that yet the Sentence of the Court passed against Mr:</hi> Sherfeild. First, if this be so, it concludes against the Sentence given in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> not against me; and he calls it here <hi>the Sentence of the Court.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, be it, that it were undoubtedly the Picture of God the Father; yet he ought to have taken Authority along with him, and not to go about it with violence, which he did, and fell and brake his Leg in the Business. Thirdly, by his own description of the Picture, it seems to me to be some old Fabulous Picture out of a <hi>Legend,</hi> and not one of God the Father: For he then told the Lords, <hi>it was a Picture of an Old Man with a Budget by his side, out of which he was plucking</hi> Adam <hi>and</hi> Eve,
<q>
                           <p>And I believe no Man ever saw God the Father so Pictured any where. Lastly, let me observe how Mr: <hi>Nicolas</hi>  takes all parts upon him wherein he may hope to do me mischief.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Sixth Charge was concerning a <hi>Bible,</hi> that was Printed with <note place="margin">VP.</note> Pictures, and sold. The Witness Mr: <hi>Walsal</hi> a Stationer. Who says, That this Bible was Licensed by Dr: <hi>Weeks;</hi> my Lord of <hi>London's</hi> Chaplain, not mine; so thus far it concerns not me.
<q>
                           <p>Yes, says Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> in his last Reply: <hi>For it appears in a List of my Chaplains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my own Hand, that Dr:</hi> Weeks <hi>was one:</hi> 'Tis true, when I was Bishop <hi>of Bath and Wells</hi> he was mine; but my Lord of <hi>London</hi> had him from me, so soon as ever he was Bishop. And was his, not mine, when he Licensed that Book. And Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> knew that I  answer'd it thus to the <hi>Lords.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </q>
He says, that <hi>I gave him direction that they should not be sold openly upon the Stalls, but only to discreet Men that knew how to use them.</hi> The Case was this. As I was at Prayers in the King's Chappel, I there saw one of them in Mrs. <hi>Kirk's</hi> Hand. She was far enough from any affection to <hi>Rome.</hi> And this being the first knowledge I had of it, many were vented and sold before I could prevent it. Upon this I sent for one (whether to this Witness or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I cannot say) and acquainted the Lords of the <hi>Council</hi> with it,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:54614:180" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and craved their direction what should be done. It was there Orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that I should forbid the open Sale of them upon their Stalls, but not otherwise to Learned and Discreet Men. And when I would have had this Order stricter, no Man stuck to me but Mr: <hi>Secretary Cook.</hi> So according to this <hi>Order</hi> I gave direction to Mr: <hi>Walsal,</hi> as he witnesses.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Here Mr.</hi> Maynard <hi>replyed, that I ought to have withstood this Order, in regard it was every way faulty. For, said he,</hi> either these Pictures were good or bad. And if they were good, why should they not be Sold openly upon the Stalls to all that would buy? And if they were bad, why should they be Sold privately to any?
<q>
                           <p>To this Reply I was not suffer'd to Answer: But when I heard Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> charge this Bible with Pictures against me, then I answer'd the thing as before, and took occasion thereby to answer this <hi>Dilemma</hi> thus. Namely, that this kind of Argument concludes not, but in things Necessary, and where no <hi>Medium</hi> can be given. For where a <hi>Medium</hi> can be given, the Horns of this Argument are too weak to hurt. And so 'tis here. For Pictures in themselves are things indifferent; not simply good, nor simply bad, but as they are used. And therefore they were not to be sold to all comers, because they may be abused, and become evil; and yet might be sold to Learned and Discreet Men, who might turn them to good. And that Images are things indifferent of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, is granted in the <hi>Homilies</hi> which are against the very <hi>Peril of</hi>

He said, <hi>there was some inconvenient Pictures among them; as the</hi> Assumption, <hi>and the</hi> Dove. Be it so, the Book was not Licensed by me or mine. And yet, as I then shewed the Lords, they were not so strict at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> against these Pictures. For the Book which Mr. <hi>Walsal</hi> shewed me, was Printed and sent thence, before it was Printed here. Besides, our old <hi>English</hi> Bibles in the beginning of the <hi>Queen</hi> were full of Pictures; and no fault found. As for that which is added at the Bar, <hi>that one of these Bibles was found in Secretary</hi> Winde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank's <hi>Trunk, and another in Sir</hi> John Lambs.

Thirdly, he confesses, that all the time he was in <hi>Lambeth-House,</hi> my Predecessor ever left that care of the Press upon his Chaplains; and why I might not do it as well as my Predecessor, I do not yet know. But he said, that <hi>he complained to Sir</hi> Edmund Scott, <hi>and desired to be advised by him what he should do: And that he Answer'd, he thought I would not meddle with that troublesome Business, more than my Predecessors had done.</hi>

                           <p>Be this so, yet Sir <hi>Ed. Scott</hi> never told me this; nor is there any the least Proof offer'd that he did. But because this and the like passages about Expunging some things out of Books, makes such a great Noise, as if nothing concerning <hi>Popery</hi> might be Printed: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> in Summing up of the Charge in the House of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> warmly insisted upon this Particular, I thought it necessary
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:54614:180"/>
to Answer as follows. That what moved my Chaplain to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punge that large passage against Images, I knew not; nor could I now know, my Chaplain being Dead. But that this I was sure of, that else-where in those very Sermons, there was as plain a passage, <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Featly's</hi> Sermons.</note> and full against <note n="*" place="margin">p. <hi>477.</hi>
                              </note> Images left in. And in another place a whole Leaf together, spent to prove them <note n="†" place="margin">p. <hi>791.</hi>
                              </note> Idolaters; and that as gross as the <hi>Baalists,</hi> and so he terms them. Yea; and that the <note n="|" place="margin">p. <hi>808.</hi>
                              </note> 
                              <hi>Pope is Antichrist</hi> too, and not only called so, but proved by divers Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. And not so only, but in plain Terms, that he is the <note n="*" place="margin">p. <hi>810.</hi>
                              </note> 
                              <hi>Whore of Babylon.</hi> And these passages I then Read out of the Book it self in the House of <hi>Commons.</hi> And many other-like to these there are. So my Chaplain might see good Cause to leave out some  passages.</p>
                        </q>
Where so many upon as good Cause were left in:</p>
                     <p>But to the Business of leaving the Care of these Books, and the overview of them to my Chaplains, it was then urged,
<q>
                           <p>That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary <note place="margin">This was done long before the <hi>Reformation;</hi> when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missaries were revocable at the pleasure of the Bishop. <hi>H. W.</hi>
                              </note> of <hi>John</hi> Lord Arch-Bishop of <hi>York,</hi> had Excommunicated the Lord Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> being then in the King's Service. And that the Arch-Bishop himself was deeply Fined for this Act of his Commissary. And that therefore I ought much more to be answerable for my Chaplain's Act, whom I might put away when I would, than he for his Commissary,  who had a Patent, and could not be put out at pleasure.</p>
                        </q>
Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> also followed this Precedent close upon me. But first, there is a great deal of difference in the thing it self: My Chaplain's Case being but the leaving out of a passage in a Book to be Printed: But his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary's Case being the Excommunicating of a great Bishop, and he in the King's Service, of whose Honour the Laws of this Realm are very tender. And Secondly, the <hi>Bishop and his Official,</hi> (call him <hi>Chancellor</hi> or <hi>Commissary,</hi> or what you will) make but one Person in Law; and therefore the Act of the Commissary to the full extent of his Patent, is the Act of the Bishop in legal Construction, and the Bishop may be answerable for it. But the Bishop and his Chaplain are not one Person in any Construction of Law.
<q>
                           <p>And say he may put away his Chaplain when he will, yet that cannot help what is past, if ought have been done amiss by him. And this was  the Answer I insisted on to Mr. <hi>Brown.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon my entrance on this days Defence, I found my self aggrieved at the <hi>Diurnal,</hi> and another Pamphlet of the Week, wherein they Print whatsoever is Charged against me, as if it were fully proved; never so much as mentioning what, or how I Answer'd. And that it troubled me the more, because (as I conceived) the passages as there expressed, trenched deep upon the Justice and Proceedings of that Honourable House. And could have no Aim but to incense the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude against me. With some difficulty I got these Pamphlets re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but there they dyed, and the Weekly abuse of me continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to keep my Patience in Breath.</p>

                        <hi>Henry Mildmaye,</hi> who (as is before related) told me without ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; That I was the most Hateful Man at <hi>Rome,</hi> that ever sate in my See since the Reformation. Now he denied not this,

                        </q>
(Mr. Serjeant <hi>Wilde</hi> was Sick, and came no more till the last day when I made my Recapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation) he minced it. And now he says, that <hi>there were two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions at</hi> Rome, <hi>and that one of them did indeed speak very ill of me, because they thought I aimed at too great a Power here in</hi> England: <hi>But the other Faction spake as well of me, because they thought I endeavoured to bring us in</hi> England <hi>nearer to the Church of</hi> Rome. But first, <hi>my Lords,</hi> this Gentleman's Words to me were Round and General. That I was hated at <hi>Rome;</hi> not of a Party, or Faction there. And my Servants heard him at the same time, and are here ready to witness it, <hi>that he then said the Pope was a goodly Gentleman, and did use to ride two or three great Horses in a Morning, and, but that he was something taller, he was as like Auditor</hi> Philips (<hi>who was then at Dinner with me) as could be.</hi> But I pray mark what Wise Men he makes them at <hi>Rome:</hi> One Faction hates me, because I aim at too much Power: And the other loves me, because I would draw <hi>England</hi> nearer <hi>Rome;</hi> Why, if I went about to draw <hi>England</hi> nearer <hi>Rome,</hi> can any among them be such Fools as to think my Power too great? For if I used my Power for them; why should any there Condemn me? And if I used it against them, why should any here Accuse me?
<q>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Non sunt haec benè divisa temporibus.</hi> These things suit not with the Times, or the Dispositions of <hi>Rome:</hi> But the plain Truth is, I do not think that ever he was at <hi>Rome;</hi> I after heard a whisper, that he only stepped into <hi>France</hi> for another Cure, not to <hi>Rome</hi> for Curiosity, which was the only cause he  gave <hi>the Lords</hi> of his going thither.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The second Witness was Mr. <hi>Challoner.</hi> He says not much of his own knowledge, but of Fame, that tatling Gossip; yet he told the Lords, <hi>I was a very Obscure Man, till within these Fifteen Years.</hi> Be it so, if he please. Yet I have been a Bishop above Three and Twenty Years: And 'tis Eighteen Years since I was first <hi>Dean of his Majesty's Chappel Royal.</hi> He says, <hi>that after this time there was a strong Opinion of Reconciliation to</hi> Rome. A strong Opinion, but a weak Proof. For it was an Opinion of Enemies, and such as could easily believe, what they over-much desired. He farther said, <hi>that some of them were of Opinion, that I was a good</hi> Roman-Catholick, <hi>and that I wrought cunningly to introduce that Religion by Inches: And that they</hi>
                        <pb n="339" facs="tcp:54614:181"/>
                        <hi>Prayed for me.</hi> First, <hi>my Lords,</hi> the Opinion of Enemies is no Proof at all, that I am such as they think me. And secondly, this is a Notable, and no unusual piece of Cunning, for an Enemy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy by commending. For this was the ready way, and I doubt not, but it hath been Practised, to raise a Jealousie against me at home, thereby either to work the Ruin of my Person, or utterly to weaken and disable me from doing harm to them, or good for <hi>the Church of England.</hi> Besides, if the Commendation of Enemies may in this kind go for Proof; it shall be in the power of two or three Practising <hi>Jesuits,</hi> to destroy any Bishop or other Church-Man of <hi>England</hi> when they please. At last, <hi>he told a Story of one Father</hi> John, <hi>a</hi> Benedictin; <hi>that he asked him how Church-Livings were disposed in</hi> England, <hi>and whether I had not the disposing of those which were in the</hi> King's Gift. <hi>And concluded, that he was not out of hope to see</hi> England <hi>reduced to</hi> Rome. Why, <hi>my Lords,</hi> this is not Father <hi>John's</hi> hope alone; for there is no <note n="*" place="margin">The Arch-Bishop calls the <hi>English</hi> Papists <hi>Roman-Catholicks;</hi> not as allowing them to be such; but referring to that Name, which some of them were before said to have affixed to him. <hi>H: W:</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> but hath some hope alive in him to see this day. And were it not for that hope, there would not have been so many, some desperate, all dangerous Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices upon this Kingdom to Effect it, both in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> time, and since. But if this, I know not what <hi>Father John</hi> hope so, what is that to me?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third Witness was Mr. <hi>Anthony Mildmaye.</hi> A Man not thought on for a Witness, till I called for his Brother Sir <hi>Henry.</hi> But now he comes laden with his Brother's Language. He says just as Sir <hi>Henry</hi> did before, <hi>that there were two Factions in</hi> Rome, <hi>the</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits, <hi>and they abhorred me; but the other, the</hi> Secular Priests, <hi>they wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me well, as he was informed.</hi> First, this is so one and the same Testimony; that any Man that will may see, that either he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his Brother, or his Brother him. Secondly, here's nothing affirmed; for it is but <hi>as he was informed.</hi> And he doth not tell you by whom. It may be my Lords, it was by his Brother. Then he says, <hi>This was to make my self Great, and tells a Tale of</hi> Father Fitton, <hi>as much to the purpose as that which Mr.</hi> Challoner <hi>told of</hi> Father John. But whatsoever either of these <hi>Fathers</hi> said, it was but their own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of me, or Hearsay; neither of which can prove me guilty of any thing.
<q>
                           <p>Thus much Mr. <hi>Anthony</hi> made a shift to say by Five of the Clock at Afternoon; when I came to make my Answer. And this (as I have sufficient Cause to think) only to help to shoar up his Brother's Testimony. But in the Morning, when he should have come, as his Brother did, he was by Nine in the Morning so Drunk, that he was not able to come to the Bar, nor to speak  Common Sense, had he been brought thither.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Second Charge was the <hi>Consecration of two Churches in</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">II.</note> London: St: <hi>Catharin Cree-Church,</hi> and St: <hi>Giles</hi> in the Fields. The Witnesses two.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The first Witness was one Mr: <hi>Willingham.</hi> And he says, <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> I came to these Churches in a Pompous manner:</hi> But all the Pomp that he mentions, is, that Sir <hi>Henry Martin,</hi> Dr: <hi>Duck,</hi> and some other of the Arches attended me, as they usually do their Diocesans in
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:54614:182"/>
such Solemnities. He says, <hi>he did curiously observe what was done, thinking it would one Day be called to an Account, as now it is.</hi> So this Man (himself being Judge) looked upon that Work with Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent Eye, and God preserve him from being a malitious Witness. He says, That at my approach to the Church Door, was read, <hi>Lift up your Heads, O ye Gates, and be ye lift up ye everlasting Doors, and the King of Glory shall come in. Psal:</hi> 24. And this was urged <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Psal.</hi> 24. 7.</note> over and over as a jeer upon my Person. But this Place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath been anciently used in Consecrations. And it relates not to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> but to <hi>God Almighty,</hi> the true King of Glory, who at the Dedication enters by his Servant to take Possession of the House, then to be made his. He says, <hi>that I kneeled down at my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, and after used many Bowings and Cringings.</hi> For my kneeling down at my entranee, to begin with Prayer, and after to proceed with Reverence, I did but my Duty in that, let him scoffingly call it <hi>Cringing,</hi> or <hi>Ducking,</hi> or what he please.</p>
                     <p>He says farther, <hi>That at the beginning I took up Dust, and threw it in the Air, and after used divers Curses.</hi> And here Mr: <hi>Pryn</hi> put Mr: <hi>Nicolas</hi> in mind to add, <hi>that</hi> Spargere Cinerem <hi>is in the Form of Consecration used in the Pontifical.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>And Mr: <hi>Brown,</hi> in his summary Account of my Charge, laid <hi>the very Consecration of these Churches,  as a Crime upon me; and insisted on this particular.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </q>
But here my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to all was the same: That this Witness had need look well to his Oath; for there was no throwing up of Dust, no Curses used throughout the whole Action: Nor did I follow the <hi>Pontifical,</hi> but a Copy of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Reverend <hi>Bishop Andrews,</hi> by which he Consecrated divers Churches in his time; and that this is so, I have the Copy by me to Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and offered them to shew it. Nor can this howsoever savour any way of <hi>Treason.</hi> No; said Mr: <hi>Brown, but the Treason is, To seek, by these Ceremonies, to overthrow the Religion Established.</hi> Nor was that ever sought by me: And God of his Mercy Preserve the true <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> Religion amongst us, till the Consecration of Churches, and Reverence in the Church, can overthrow it; and then I doubt not, but by God's Blessing, it shall continue safe to the Worlds End.</p>
                     <p>He says also, <hi>That I did pronounce the Place Holy.</hi> I did so: And that was in the Solemn Act it self of the Consecration, according to the usual Form in that behalf. And no Man will deny, but that there <hi>is a Derivative, and</hi>

<q>
                           <p>And this since upon perusal of the Place, I find to be true. For after he had in some sort Commended the Popes for taking away some gross and superstitious Purgations, he adds, that yet for want of Piety, or Prudence, their later <hi>Pontifical</hi> and <hi>Missal-Books</hi> did outgo the Ancient <hi>In Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudine Ceremoniarum, &amp; peragendi Difficultate, &amp; Taedio, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p n="2">2. The Second Witness was Mr. <hi>Hope.</hi> He says, <hi>That he agrees with the former Witness, and saw all, and the throwing up of the Dust,</hi> &amp;c. Since he agrees with the former Witness, I give him the same Answer. Yet with this Observation upon him and his Oath. The former Witness says, that <hi>at the beginning of this Action,</hi> I took Dust and threw it up: This Man agrees with him, and saw all; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in the very next Words confesses, <hi>he was not there at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> Not there: Yet he saw it. <hi>My Lords;</hi> if you mark it, this is a wholsom Oath. He says, <hi>That then the Church-Yard was Consecrated by it self.</hi> It was ever so; the one Act must follow the other, though both done the same Day: For the Places being different, the Act could not pass upon them at the same time. Then he said, <hi>there were Fees required, and a good Eye had to the Money.</hi> This is a poor Objection against me: If the Officers did exact any Money without Rule, or beyond President; let them answer for it. But for that which was said to belong to me, I presently gave it to the Poor of the Parish. And this Mr. <hi>Dell</hi> my Secretary then present attested to <hi>the Lords.</hi> Lastly, he said, <hi>they were not New Churches.</hi> Let him look to his Oath again; for 'tis notoriously known, they were both New Built from the Ground; and St. <hi>Giles</hi> not wholly upon the Old Foundation.</p>

                     <p>The Chappels they instance in are Three. First, they say, <hi>I Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated a Chappel of the Right Honourable the Lord Treasurer</hi> Weston's. I did so, and did no harm therein. As for the touch given by

Secondly, they Instanced <hi>in a Chappel of Sir</hi> John Worstenham's <hi>Building.</hi> 'Tis true I Consecrated that too, <note place="margin">2.</note> but that was a Parish-Church, Built in the Place where he was born, and it was in my <hi>Diocess,</hi> and so the Work proper for me. The Third Instance was in my own Chappel, in my House at <hi>Aberguilly,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">3.</note> when I was Bishop of St. <hi>Davids;</hi> the Room lay waste and out of Repair, and I fitted it at my own Cost, and Consecrated it into a Chappel, that House having no Oratory before. Here they farther aggravated many circumstances: As First, that I named it at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, <note place="margin">

                        <hi>Avowed to be mine, in which was a fair description of Chappel Furniture, and Rich Plate, and the Ceremonies in use in that Chappel, and Wafers for the Communion.</hi> At the reading of this Paper, I was a little troubled. I knew I was not then so Rich, as to have such Plate, or Furniture; and therefore I humbly desired sight of the Paper. So soon as I saw it, I found there was nothing in it in my Hand, but the Indorsement, which told the Reader plainly, that it was the Model of Reverend Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> his Chappel, with the Furniture, Plate, Ceremonies therein used, and all Things else. And this Copy was sent me by the Household Chaplain to that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Bishop.</hi>

                           <p>This I laid open to the Lords, and it would have made any Man ashamed, but Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> who had delivered upon Oath, that it was a Paper of my Chappel Furniture at <hi>Aberguilly,</hi>  contrary to his Conscience, and his own Eye-sight of the Paper.</p>

                        </gap>, I never either gave, or received the Communion, but in Ordinary Bread. At <hi>Westminster</hi> I knew it was sometimes used, but as a thing indifferent. As for the Slur here given to that Reverend Dead Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> it might well have been spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; he deserved far better usage for his Service to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Protestant Cause.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Fourth Charge, was the Publishing <hi>the Book of Recreations:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">IV.</note> And it was ushered in with this Scorn upon me, <hi>That I laboured to put a Badge of Holiness, by my Breath, upon Places; and to take it away from Days.</hi> But I did neither; the <hi>King</hi> commanded the Printing of it, as is therein attested, and the Warrant which the King gave

me, they have: And though at Consecrations I read the Prayers, yet it was God's Blessing, not my Breath, that gave the Holyness. And for the Day, I ever laboured it might be kept Holy, but yet free from a Superstitious Holyness. And First, it was said, <hi>That this was done of purpose to take away Preaching.</hi> But First, there is no Proof of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for this. And Secondly, 'tis impossible: For till the Afternoon Service and Sermon were done; no Recreation is allowed by that Book; nor then to any but such as have been at both. Therefore it could not be done to take it away. Thirdly, the Book names none but <hi>Lawful Recreations:</hi> Therefore if any unlawful be used, the Book gives them no Warrant. And that some are Lawful (after the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service of God is ended) appears by the Practice of <hi>Geneva,</hi> where after Evening Prayer, the Elder Men Bowl, and the Younger Train. And <hi>Calvin</hi> says in express Terms, That one Cause of the Institution of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath <note place="margin">Tertio Servis, &amp; ijs qui sub aliorum degerent Imperio, quietis Diem indulgendum censuit, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Then it was urged, <hi>That there was great Ryot and Disorder at Wakes kept on the Lords Day.</hi> That is a very sufficient Cause to regulate and order those Feasts, but not quite to take them away. I make no doubt for my part, but that <hi>the Feast of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi> was abused by some among <hi>the Jews;</hi> and yet <hi>Christ</hi> was so far from taking it away for that, as that he honoured it with his own Presence.

                        <hi>three Causes why that Book was Published,</hi> that was a Note ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for my own Private Use and Memory.</p>
                     <p>Then came in Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> who said, that <hi>the Lord Chief Justice</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardson <hi>had made an Order in his Circuit against these Wakes, and was forced to revoke it.</hi> This was done by Authority, as is before answered; to which I refer my self. Here 'tis added, to help fill up the Noise: But Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> says, <hi>That all the Gentlemen in the Country Petitioned on the Judges behalf.</hi> No; there was a great Faction in <hi>Sommersetshire</hi> at that time, and Sir <hi>Robert Philips</hi> and all his Party writ up against the Judge and the Order he made, as was apparent by the Certificates which he returned. And Sir <hi>Robert</hi> was well known in his time to be neither <hi>Popish,</hi> nor <hi>Prophane.</hi> He says far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>That</hi> William <hi>then Earl of</hi> Pembrooke <hi>was out of Town, and the Book Printed in the</hi> Interim <hi>by my Procurement.</hi> But for this last, here's not one Word of Proof offered, and so I leave it.</p>
                     <p>The Fifth Charge was, that some Ministers were punished for not <note place="margin">V.</note> reading this Book. Witnesses for this were produced.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The First was Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent;</hi> who says, <hi>he had Charge from me to call for an account of not reading this Book, both in my Province at my Visitation, and in my Diocess.</hi> His Majesty having Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this, I could do little, if I had not so much as inquired what was done: And he confesses, <hi>that for my Province he gave time to them which had not read it, and then never asked more after it.</hi> So here was no eager Prosecution. But then he says, <hi>that three in my Diocess stood out, and asked time.</hi> And confesses that I granted it: But adds,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:54614:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>that when he asked more time for them, I denyed; and that they were then suspended</hi> ab Officio <hi>only.</hi> I thought I had reason to deny, when I saw they did but dally by asking time. And it was then evident, that in the <hi>Diocess</hi> of other Bishops far more than Three were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and their Punishment greater.
<q>
                           <p>However, this my proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was far from Rigour. And this was the Answer that I gave Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> who in the Summ of his Charge, instanced in this  Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular against me.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Second witness was Mr. <hi>Culmer,</hi> one of the Three Ministers that was suspended. He says, <hi>That he was suspended by Sir</hi> Nathaniel Brent, <hi>and that when he came to me about it, I said, If you know not how to Obey, I know not how to Grant your Petition.</hi> Truly, <hi>my Lords,</hi> finding him both Wilful and Ignorant, I cannot tell what I could say less. He says, <hi>that his Patron took away his Benefice.</hi> Why, <hi>my Lords,</hi> he had none; he was only a <hi>

He says, <hi>he was not absolved till the</hi> Scots <hi>came in, and that he was Conformable in all things else.</hi> For the time of his Absolution, I leave that to the Record: But for his Conformity in other <note place="margin">This Mr: <hi>Culmer</hi> not only Pissed in the Church of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> but also demolished the Noble Glass-Windows of it with his own Hands.

                           <p>This I can say for him, he is good at Purchasing a Benefice: For he offered a Servant of mine One Hundred and Fifty Pound, so he could procure me but to Name him to the Parliament for <hi>Chartham</hi> in <hi>Kent.</hi> Since, I have heard he is as good at doing Reverence in the Church: For he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                              </note> it was unfit such Books should be sent, for Ministers to read in the Church. And was himself laid by the Heels for the Falshood of this Information.

                     <p n="3">3. The Third Witness is Mr. <hi>Wilson.</hi> He says, <hi>That I sent to Sir</hi> Nath. Brent <hi>to Suspend him.</hi> That is true, but it was when he would neither Obey, nor keep in his Tongue. He says, <hi>his Living was Sequestred for almost Four Years.</hi> But it was not for Not Reading this Book. For himself confesses it was done in the <hi>High-Commission;</hi> and that for Dilapidations, in Not Repairing his House.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Fourth Witness was one Mr. <hi>Snelling,</hi> a Minister in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocess of <hi>Rochester.</hi> All that was done against this Man was openly in the <hi>High-Commission</hi> Court. And there he was Censured for other things, as well as for this. Himself confesses his open refusing to Bow at the Name of <hi>Jesus,</hi> though the Canon of the Church Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it.

it cannot touch me: For those things were done at Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where I was not present.

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs with Serjeant <hi>Turner,</hi> I give him the same Answer. For
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:54614:185" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that which he adds, that Dr. <hi>Walton did let Leases of these Houses at an undervalue, and called none of the Parishioners to it:</hi> If he did in this any thing contrary to Justice, or the Will of the Donor, or the Decree; he is Living to Answer for himself; me it concerns not. For <hi>his Exception taken to my Grant,</hi> (of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation I think he means) <hi>and to the Words therein,</hi> Omnis &amp; Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimoda, &amp;c. 'Tis the Ancient Stile of such Grants, for I know not how many Hundred Years; no Syllable innovated or altered by me.</p>
                     <p>Then followed the Charge of Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> about <note place="margin">VII.</note> their Answer, and their not being suffer'd to put it into the <hi>Star-Chamber.</hi> Which though Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> pressed at large before, yet here it must come again, to help fill the World with Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. Yet to that which shall but seem new I shall Answer. Two things are said. (1.) The one, <hi>That they were not suffered to put in their defence,</hi> Modo &amp; Forma, <hi>as it was laid.</hi> There was an Order made openly in Court to the Judges, to Expunge Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Matter. And the two <hi>Chief Justices</hi> did Order the Expung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all that which was Expunged, be it more or less: As ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the <hi>Acts</hi> of that Court. (2.) The other is, <hi>that I procured this Expunging.</hi> The Proofs that I procured it were these. 1. First, <hi>because Mr.</hi> Cockshot <hi>gave me an Account of the business from Mr. Attorney.</hi> I had Reason to look after the business, the whole Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> being scandalized in that Bill, as well as my self. But this is no Proof, that I either gave direction or used any solicitation to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend <hi>Judges,</hi> to whom it was referred. 2. Secondly, <hi>because I gave the Lords thanks for it:</hi> It was openly in Court: It was after the Expunging was agreed unto. And what could I do less in such a Cause of the Church, though I had not been personally concerned in it? 3. Thirdly, <hi>because I had a Copy of their Answer found in my Study.</hi> I conceive it was not only fit, but necessary for me to have one, the Nature of the Cause considered. But who interlined any passages in it with black Lead, I know not. For I ever used Ink, and no black Lead all my Life. These be strange Proofs that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured any thing.</p>
                     <p>Then Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> added, <hi>That the Justice and Favour which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded Dr.</hi> Leighton, <hi>was denyed unto him:</hi> As far as I remember, it was for the putting in of his Answer under his own Hand. This, if so, was done by Order of the Court, it was not my Act.</p>
                     <p>The last Charge followed. And that was taken out of the Preface <note place="margin">VIII.</note> to my <hi>Speech</hi> in Star-Chamber. The Words are, <hi>That one way of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">My Speech in the Star-Chamber, <hi>Praefat.</hi> versus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>is not always either fit or safe, when the Humors of the People are in a continual Change,</hi> &amp;c. From whence they inferred, I laboured to reduce all to an Arbitrary Government. But I do humbly conceive, no construction can force these Words against me for an Arbitrary Government. For the meaning is, and can be no other, for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a stricter, and sometimes a remisser holding and ordering the Reins of Government; yet both according to the same Laws, by a different use and application of Mercy and Justice to Offenders.
<q>
                           <p>And so I Answer'd to Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> who charged this against me as one of my ill Counsels to <hi>his Majesty.</hi> But my Answer given is
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:54614:185" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Truth. For it is not said, That there should not be One Law for Government, but not One way in the Ordering and Execution of that Law.

He speaks, <hi>as if he had fled from his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry here for fear of me.</hi> But the Second Witness Mr. <hi>Dukeswell</hi> says, that he went away upon a Warrant that came to Summon him into the <hi>High Commission.</hi> The Truth is, <hi>my Lords,</hi> and 'tis well known, and to some of his best Friends, that I preserved him once before, and my Lord <hi>Veer</hi> came and gave me Thanks for it. If after this he fell into danger again, <hi>Majus Peccatum habet;</hi> I cannot preserve Men that will continue in dangerous courses. He says farther (and in this the other Witness agrees with him) <hi>That when I heard he was gone into</hi> New-England, <hi>I should say my Arm should reach him there.</hi> The Words I remember not. But for the thing, I cannot think it fit that any Plantation should secure any Offender against the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And therefore if I did say my Arm should reach him, or them so offending, I know no Crime in it; so long as my Arm reached no Man but by the Law.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Second Witness Mr. <hi>Dukeswell</hi> adds nothing to this, but that he says, Sir <hi>Maurice Abbot</hi> kept him in before. For which Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony I thank him. For by this it appears, that Mr. <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> was a dangerous Factious Man, and so accounted in my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor's Time, and it seems Prosecuted then too, that his Brother Sir <hi>Maurice Abbot</hi> was fain, (being then a Parishioner of his) to labour hard to keep him in.</p>
                        <p>The Second Charge was concerning <hi>Nathaniel Wickens,</hi> a Servant <note place="margin">II.</note> of Mr. <hi>Pryns.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. The First Witness in this Cause was <hi>William Wickens,</hi> Father to <hi>Nathaniel.</hi> He says, <hi>his Son was Nine Weeks in divers Prisons, and for no Cause but for that he was Mr.</hi> Pryn's <hi>Servant.</hi> But it appears <hi>apud Acta,</hi> that there were many Articles of great Misdemeanour against him. And afterwards himself adds, <hi>That he knew no Cause but his refusing to take the Oath</hi> Ex Officio. Why, but if he knew that, then he knew another Cause, beside his being Mr. <hi>Pryn's</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. Unless he will say all Mr. <hi>Pryn's</hi> Servants refuse that Oath, and all that refuse that Oath are Mr. <hi>Pryn's</hi> Servants. As for the Sentence which was laid upon him and the Imprisonment, that was the Act of the <hi>High-Commission,</hi> not mine. Then he says, <hi>That my Hand was first in the Warrant for his Commitment.</hi> And so it was to be of course.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Second Witness was <hi>Sarah Wayman.</hi> She says, <hi>that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to take the Oath.</hi> Therefore he was not committed for being Mr. <hi>Pryn's</hi> Servant. She says, <hi>that for refusing the Oath, he was threatned he should be taken</hi> pro Confesso: <hi>And that when one of the Doctors replyed, that could not be done by the Order of the</hi>
                           <pb n="349" facs="tcp:54614:186" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                           <hi>Court, I should say, I would have an Order by the next Court Day.</hi> 'Tis manifest in the Course of that Court, that any Man may be taken <hi>pro Confesso,</hi> that will not take the Oath, and answer. Yet seeing how that party of Men prevailed, and that one Doctors doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing might breed more Difference, to the great Scandal and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that Court, I publickly acquainted <hi>his Majesty</hi> and the Lords with it. Who were all of Opinion, that if such Refusers might not be taken <hi>pro Confesso,</hi> the whole Power of the Court was shaken. And hereupon <hi>his Majesty</hi> sent his Letter under his Signet, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us to uphold the Power of the Court, and to proceed. She says farther, <hi>that he desired the sight of his Articles, which was denyed him.</hi> It was the constant and known Course of that Court, that he might not see the Articles till he had taken the Oath, which he refused to do.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Third Witness was one <hi>Flower.</hi> He agrees <hi>about the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of taking him</hi> pro Confesso. But that's answerd. He adds, <hi>that there was nothing laid to his Charge,</hi> and yet confesses that <hi>Wickens</hi> desired to see the Articles that were against him. This is a pretty Oath. There were Articles against him, which he desired to see, and yet there was nothing laid to his Charge.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Then was produced <hi>his Majesty's</hi> Letter sent unto us. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>the King</hi> requires us by his Supream Power Ecclesiastical to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, &amp;c. We had been in a fine case, had we disobeyed this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Besides, <hi>my Lords,</hi> I pray mark it; we are enjoyned to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by <hi>the King's</hi> Supream Power Ecclesiastical; and yet it is here urged against me, that this was done to bring in <hi>Popery.</hi> An Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent new way of bringing in <hi>Popery</hi> by <hi>the King's</hi> Supremacy. Yea, but they say, <hi>I should not have procured this Letter.</hi> Why? I hope I may by all Lawful ways preserve the Honour, and just Power of the Court in which I sat. And 'tis expressed in the Letter, that no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> was done, than was agreeable to the Laws and Customs of the Realm. And 'tis known that both an Oath, and a taking <hi>pro Confesso</hi> in point of refusal, are used both in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> and in the <hi>Chancery.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. The last Witness was Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> who says, <hi>That his Man was not suffered to come to him, during his Soarness when his ears were Crop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</hi> This Favour should have been asked of the Court of <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> not of me. And yet here is no Proof that I denyed him this, but the bare Report of him, whom he says, he employed. Nor do I remember any Man's coming to me about it.</p>
                        <p>The Third Charge followed, <hi>it was concerning stopping of Book</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">III.</note> 
                           <hi>from the Press, both Old and New, and expunging some things out of them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. The first Instance was about <hi>the English Bibles with the</hi> Geneva <hi>Notes.</hi> The Bibles with those Notes were tolerated indeed both in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> his Time; but allowed by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in neither. And King <hi>James</hi> said plainly, <hi>That he thought the</hi>

                           </note> Geneva <hi>Translation was the worst, and many of the Notes very Partial, Vntrue, Seditious, and savouring too much of Dangerous and Traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Conceits. And gave Instance.</hi> This passage I then read to <hi>the Lords:</hi> And withal told them, that now of late these Notes were more commonly used to ill purposes, than formerly, and that that
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:54614:187" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was the Cause why <hi>the High-Commission</hi> was more careful and strict against them than before.</p>
                        <p>Here <hi>Michael Sparks</hi> the Elder came in as Witness, and said, <hi>he was called into the</hi> High Commission <hi>about these Books:</hi> But he confesses, it was not only for them. He says, <hi>the restraint of those Bibles was for the Notes.</hi> But he adds, <hi>as he supposes.</hi> And his Supposal is no Proof. Besides, he might have added here also, that the restraint was not for the Notes only: For by the numerous coming over of Bibles, both with and without Notes from <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> there was a great and a just fear conceived, that by little and little, Printing would quite be carried out of the Kingdom. For the Books which came thence, were better Print, better Bound, better Paper, and for all the Charges of bringing, sold better Cheap. And would any Man Buy a worse Bible Dearer, that might have a better more Cheap? And to preserve Printing here at home, as well as the Notes, was the Cause of stricter looking to those Bibles. And this appears by a Letter of Sir <hi>William Boswell's</hi> his Majesty's Agent in the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys;</hi> the Letter written to me, and now produced against me: But makes for me, as I conceive. For therein he sends me word of two Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of the Bible in <hi>English,</hi> one with Notes, and the other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: And desires me to take care to regulate this business at home. What should I do? Should I sleep upon such Advertisements as these, and from such a hand? Especially since he sends word also, that Dr. <hi>Amyes</hi> was then Printing of a Book wholly against the Church of <hi>England.</hi> So my Care was against all underminings, both at home and abroad, of the Established Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for which I am now like to suffer. And I pray God that point of <hi>Arminianism, Libertas Prophetandi,</hi> do not more Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief in short time, than is expressible by me.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Second Instance was about the New <hi>Decree</hi> of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>, concerning Printing. <hi>Four Articles of this</hi> Decree <hi>were read, namely, the</hi> 1, 2, 18, 24. What these are, may be seen in the <hi>Deecree:</hi> And as I think that whole Decree made <hi>Anno</hi> 1637. use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and necessary: So, under <hi>your Lordships</hi> Favour, I think those Four Articles as necessary as any.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Waly</hi> and Mr. <hi>Downes,</hi> two Stationers, Witnesses in this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, say, <hi>That they desired some Mitigation of the</hi> Decree, <hi>and that Judge</hi> Bramston <hi>said, he could not do it without me.</hi> I saw my <hi>Lord Chief Justice Bramston</hi> here in the Court but the other Day; why was not he examined, but these Men only, who oppose all Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of the Press, that opposes their Profit?

                        <p n="3">3. The Third Instance was, <hi>That I used my Power to suppress Books in</hi> Holland. This was drawn out of a Letter which <hi>John le Mare,</hi> one of the Prime Preachers in <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> writ to me; expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing therein, that <hi>since the Proclamation made by</hi> the States, <hi>no Man durst meddle with Printing any Seditious Libels, against either the State or Church of</hi> England. Where's the Fault? For this Gentleman did a very good Office to this Kingdom and Church, in procuring that <hi>Proclamation:</hi> For till this was done, every discontented Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit could Print what he pleased at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> against either: And if he had any Direction from me about it (which is not proved) I neither am, nor can be sorry for it. And the Fear which kept Men in from Printing, proceeded from the Proclamation of <hi>the States,</hi> not from any Power of mine.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The Fourth Instance was in <hi>the Book of Martyrs.</hi> But that was but named, to Credit a base Business, <hi>an Almanack</hi> made by one Mr. <note n="*" place="margin">His Name was <hi>Gelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand. W. S. A. C.</hi>
                           </note> 
                           <hi>Genebrand:</hi> In which he had left out all the Saints, <hi>Apostles</hi> and all; and put in those which are named in Mr. <hi>Fox:</hi> And yet not all them neither; for he had left out the Solemn Days, which are in <hi>Fox,</hi> as <hi>Feb.</hi> 2. <hi>Feb.</hi> 25. <hi>Mar.</hi> 25. And <hi>Cranmer</hi> Translated to <hi>Mar.</hi> 23.</p>
                        <p>In this Particular Mr. <hi>Genebrand,</hi> Brother to this Almanack-maker, witnesseth, <hi>that the Queen sent to me about this New Almanack.</hi> If <hi>her Majesty</hi> did send to me about it (as 'tis probable she would disdain the Book) is that any Crime in me? Could I prevent <hi>her Majestys</hi> sending, who could not know so much as that she would send? He says, <hi>his Brother was acquitted in the</hi> High-Commission, <hi>but charged by me that he made a Faction in the Court.</hi> If I did say so, surely, <hi>my Lords,</hi> I saw some practising by him in this new-found way. He says, <hi>the</hi> Papists <hi>bought up a great number of these</hi> Almanacks, <hi>and burnt them.</hi> It seems he could not hinder that, nor I neither; unless it shall not be Lawful for <hi>a Papist</hi> to buy an <hi>Almanack.</hi> For when he hath bought him, he may burn him if he please.</p>
                        <p>But since <hi>the Book of Martyrs</hi> was named, I shall tell <hi>your Lordships</hi> how careful I was of it. It is well known, how easily <hi>Abridgments,</hi> by their Brevity and their Cheapness, in short time work out the Authors themselves. Mr. <hi>Young</hi> the Printer laboured me earnestly and often for an <hi>Abridgment of the Book of Martyrs.</hi> But I still with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood it (as my Secretary here present can Testifie) upon these two Grounds. The one, lest it should bring the large Book it self into disuse. And the other, lest if any Material thing should be left out, that should have been charged as done of purpose by me; as now I see it is in other Books. And I humbly pray <hi>your Lordships</hi> cast your Eyes upon the Frontispiece of the <hi>Book of Martyrs,</hi> Printed <hi>An:</hi> 1642. since this <hi>Parliament</hi> began, and when I was safe enough from having any Hand in the Business; and there you shall see as dangerous Pictures as have been charged upon me, or any my Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Windows.</p>
                        <p>Upon Occasion of Mr. <hi>Genebrand's</hi> Calendar, Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to tell the Lords, <hi>that I had made Notes upon the</hi> Calendar <hi>in</hi>
                           <pb n="352" facs="tcp:54614:188"/>
                           <hi>the Missal.</hi> I desired they might be read: It was thought too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. They were nothing but some Additions of my own reading to the Occurrences on some Days. And because the Calendar in the <hi>Missal</hi> was open and large, I thought fit to Write them there.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The Fifth Instance is in Dr. <hi>Pocklinton</hi> his Censure of <note n="*" place="margin">I believe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And he was Censured in this Honourable House for that and like slips of his. Then it was inferred at the Bar, <hi>That it must be taken as my Act, if it were done by my Chaplain.</hi> But Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are no sworn Proof: And, I conceive, no Man can by Law be punished criminally for his Servants Fact; Unless there be Proof that he had a hand in it. Then it was urged, but without any Proof too, <hi>that Dr.</hi> Pocklinton <hi>was preferred by me.</hi> To which I shall answer when Proof is made: And if I had, 'tis far enough from Treason.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The next Instance was, <hi>about the calling in of</hi> Thomas Beacons <hi>Disputation of the Mass.</hi> The Witness Mr. <hi>Pryn.</hi> He says, <hi>the Book</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                           <hi>was Licensed, and that a</hi> Papist <hi>thereupon said, doth my Lord of</hi> Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury <hi>License such Books? That I was informed of these Words, and the Book called in the next Day.</hi> First, Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> is single in this part of the Testimony for the Words. Secondly, if any <hi>Papist</hi> did say so, it was not in my Power to stop his Mouth; and they which License Books, must indure many and various Censures, as the Readers of them stand affected. Thirdly, if any <hi>Papist</hi> did so speak, I have reason to think it was to do me a Mischief, as much as in him lay. Fourthly, this is a very bold Oath; <hi>For he swears, that I was Inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of these Words.</hi> He was not present to hear it, and then he can have it but by <hi>Hearsay,</hi> and no Religion teaches him to swear that for Truth, which he doth but hear. Lastly, the Book was called in, because it was slipt out contrary to the late <hi>Decree</hi> for Printing. Yea, but Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> Swears, and so doth <hi>Michael Sparks</hi> the other Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                           <hi>that the Book was sent to the Printer before the Decree.</hi> But first, <hi>Sparks</hi> his Oath is uncertain; for he says Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> sent him the Book before the <hi>Decree,</hi> and then by and by after, says, it was about that time. Now the Book is somwhat large, so that it might be sent him before the <hi>Decree,</hi> and yet not be Printed till after, and that a good space too. And Secondly, Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> himself confesses, the Book was sent when the <hi>Decree</hi> was in agitation.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The Seventh Instance was about <hi>Arminianism, as maintained by me against the Declarations of both Houses of Parliament, and of King</hi> James, <hi>concerning</hi> Vorstius <hi>and</hi> Bertius. First, I have nothing to do to defend <hi>Arminianism,</hi> no Man having yet charged me with the abetting any point of it. Secondly, King <hi>James</hi> his Declaration is very Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But under Favour, he puts a great deal of difference between <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stius</hi> and <hi>Bertius:</hi> And <hi>his Majesty's</hi> Opinion is clear with the Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and so Expressed by himself: And to which I ever Consented.

or with very little difference from those which are now called <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianism.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And here comes in <hi>Michael Sparks;</hi> who says, <hi>He was called into the</hi> High-Commission <hi>about a Book of Bishop</hi> Carletons. I cannot pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually remember all Particulars so long since. But he confesses the Business was in the <hi>High-Commission.</hi> And so not singly chargable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me. Besides, he is single in this Business. He says, <hi>he was Eleven Years in the</hi> High-Commission, <hi>and never Sentenced.</hi>
                           <q>
                              <p>This is more than I know. But if it be so, he had better luck than some Honester Men. For a bitterer Enemy to his power, the Church-Government never had.</p>
                           </q>
He was Mr. <hi>Pryn's</hi> Printer. He says, <hi>I was a Dean then, and he thinks of</hi> Hereford. I was never Dean of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> But howsoever, this is a dangerous Oath; let him think of it. He Swears that I was a <hi>Dean</hi> then; and a <hi>High-Commissioner;</hi> or else what had I to do in the Business? Now it is well known I was never a <hi>High-Commissioner,</hi> till I had been a Bishop some Years. For the Book it self, <hi>Sparks</hi> says nothing what was the Argument of it: But (so far as I remember) it was expresly against the King's <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                           <q>
                              <p>And so I Answer'd Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> when he summed up the Evidence against me in the <hi>House of Commons.</hi> And though in his Reply he seemed to deny this, yet I remember no Proof he brought  for it.</p>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">8. The last Instance was pregnant, and brought forth many Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. As First, Dr: <hi>Featly's Parallels against Bishop</hi> Mountague. <note place="margin">1.</note> But this was Still-born; at least it says nothing of me. Secondly, <note place="margin">2.</note>

My Friends were willing to perswade me, that my Answer had much abated the edge of the People, saving from the violent and factious Leaders of the Multitude, whom it seems nothing would satisfie but my Life (for so I was after told in plain terms, by a Man deeply interessed in them;) when I presently saw <hi>Quaterman</hi> coming towards me, who, so soon as he came, fell to his wonted Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and asked aloud, <hi>what</hi> the Lords <hi>meant, to be troubled so long and so often, with such a base Fellow as I was, they should do well to Hang me out of the way.</hi> I heard the Words with grief enough, and so left them and him in the Hands of God. My Servants were earness to have me complain to <hi>the Lords.</hi> I remembred my late Complaint about the Pamphlets had no redress; and so forbare it. They not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, out of their Zeal, complained to Mr. Lieutenant of <hi>the Tower;</hi> who presently went forth, and said he would school him. But I hearkned no more after it.</p>
                     <p>When I came to the Bar, Mr: <hi>Nicolas</hi> began with great violence, and told the Lords, the <hi>business grew higher and higher against me.</hi> What the Business did, will after appear; but I am sure he grew higher and higher, and from this time forward, besides the violence of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, gave me such Language, as no <hi>Christian</hi> would give a <hi>Jew.</hi> But God, I humbly thank him, blessed me with Patience; and so I made my Ears Obedient. That which made him say <hi>the Business grew higher and higher,</hi> was this. Upon my often calling to have the Oaths at the Coronation of King <hi>James</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> compared, some of them repaired again to my Study at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> to search for all such Copies of <hi>Coronation-Books</hi> as could there be found.

they found some Papers concerning <hi>Parliaments,</hi> no other (I praise God for it) than such, as with indifferent construction might (I hope) well pass, especially considering what occasion led me, and what Command was upon me. And as I have been told by Able and Experienced Men, they would have been nothing, had they been found in any, but this troublesom and distracted time about the Rights of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> (as 'tis said.) Howsoever, I was most unfortunate they should be now found, and I had not left them a Being, but that I verily thought I had destroyed them long since. But they were unhappily found among the heaps of my Papers. And so</p>
                     <p>An <hi>Answer to the Remonstrance</hi> made <hi>June:</hi> 17: 1628. (which is <note place="margin">I.</note> Sixteen Years since) was made the First Charge against me.</p>
                     <p>And the Second Charge was, <hi>A Paper concerning a Declaration,</hi> Jan: <note place="margin">II.</note> 28: 1628. To both which I then Answer'd; but because these are urged more than once, to help fill the People with new Clamour, and because they are more closely pressed against me at the last day of my Hearing; and because Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> in his Summary Charge, laid and charged all these Papers together; to avoid tedious repetition, I will also make my whole and entire Answer together, when that time comes.</p>
                     <p>The Third Charge of this day was, <hi>A Letter of a</hi> Jesuit <hi>to his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour,</hi>

                        <hi>found in my Study, dated</hi> Mar: 1628. Let the Letter be dated when it will, I hope the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> may get and keep the Letters of any <hi>Jesuits</hi> or others. How shall I be able to know or prevent their Plots upon the Religion by Law Established, if this may not be done? Yet this I desire all Men to take notice of, that this Letter was not directed to me. I was then Bishop of <hi>London:</hi> The Letter was found in a search. But when by all possible care taken by the <hi>High-Commission</hi> the Author could not be found, I had (as I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive) great Reason to keep it. And I then humbly desired, the whole Letter might be Read. There was in it, that <hi>Arminianism</hi> (as 'twas urged) <hi>was their Drug, and their Plot against us,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Jesuit</hi> seeing a Fire kindling about these Opinions, might write what he pleased to help on his Cause. Yet <hi>this Drug,</hi> which he says is theirs, is the received Opinion of <hi>all the Lutherans,</hi> and they too Learned <hi>Protestants</hi> to use <hi>their Drugs.</hi> And if it be their Drug, why do the <hi>Dominicans</hi> so Condemn it? Nay, why doth the <hi>Master of the Sentences,</hi> and the <hi>School</hi> after him, for the most, determin rigid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against it? And whereas 'tis said, <hi>That these Men had Instruments at the</hi> Duke's <hi>Chamber Door.</hi> That belongs not to me, I was not Porter there. As for that Power which I had (called by Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> the Command of his Ear) I used it as much as I could to shut such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments thence. Beside, 'tis barely said, no Proof at all offer'd, that such Instruments were about the <hi>Duke's</hi> Chamber-Door. Other Papers were found in my Study, above sixty at the least, expressing my continued Labours for some Years together, to Reconcile <hi>the divided Protestants in</hi> Germany, that so they might go with united Forces against the <hi>Romanists.</hi>

The Fourth Charge was Bishop <hi>Mountagues</hi> Preferment. <hi>The Parliament</hi> (they say) <hi>called him in Question, and the King called in his Book; yet, in Affront to the Parliament, that he was preferr'd by me.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">IV.</note> No: It was then publickly known in Court (whether now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred or no, I cannot tell) that he was preferred by <hi>my Lord Duke;</hi> but being a Church Business, <hi>the King</hi> Commanded me to signifie his Pleasure to the Signet Office. And the <hi>Docket</hi> (which is all the Proof here made) mentions him only by whom <hi>the Kings</hi> Pleasure is signified, not him that procures the Preferment. So the <hi>Docket</hi> in this Case no Proof at all.</p>
                     <p>The Fifth Charge was a Paper Intituled, <hi>Considerations for the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">V.</note> 
                        <hi>Church.</hi> Three Exceptions against them. <hi>The Observation of the King's Declaration,</hi> Art 3. <hi>The Lecturers,</hi> Art 5. <hi>And the High-Commission and Prohibitions,</hi> Art 10, 11. The Paper I desired might be all Read. Nothing in them against either Law or Religion. And for Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers a better care taken, and with more Ease to the People, and more Peace to the Church, by a Combination of Conformable Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Ministers, in their turns, and not by some one Humorous Man, who too often mis-leads the People. Secondly, my Copy of <note place="margin">I suppose these <hi>Considerations</hi> are those Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in <hi>Pryn's</hi> Compl. Hist. p. <hi>287. W. S. A. C.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Considerations</hi> came from <hi>Arch-Bishop Harsnet,</hi> in which was some sour Expression concerning <hi>Emanuel</hi> and <hi>Sidney</hi> Colleges in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> which <hi>the King</hi> in his Wisdom thought fit to leave out. The King's <hi>Instructions</hi> upon these <hi>Considerations,</hi> are under Mr. <hi>Baker's</hi> Hand, who was Secretary to my Predecessor. And they were sent to me to make Exceptions to them, if I knew any, in regard of the Ministers of <hi>London,</hi> whereof I was then <hi>Bishop.</hi> And by this, that they were thus sent unto me by my Predecessor, 'tis manifest, that this account from the several Dioceses to <hi>the Arch-Bishop,</hi> and from him to <hi>his Majesty</hi> once a Year, was begun before my time. Howsoever, if it had not, I should have been glad of the Honour of it, had it begun in mine. For I humbly conceive, there cannot be a better or a safer way to preserve Truth and Peace in the Church, than that once a Year every <hi>Bishop</hi> should give an account of all greater Occurrences in the Church to his <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> and he to <hi>the King.</hi> Without which, <hi>the King,</hi> who is the Supream, is like to be a great Stranger to all Church Proceedings.</p>
                     <p>The Sixth Charge was about Dr: <hi>Sibthorp's Sermon, that my Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">VI.</note> 
                        <hi>opposed the Printing of it, and that I opposed him to Affront the Parliament.</hi> Nothing so, <hi>my Lords.</hi> Nothing done by me to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, or affront, the One or the Other. This Sermon came forth when <hi>the Loan</hi> was not yet settled in Parliament. The Lords, and the Judges, and the Bishops, were some for, some against it. And if my Judgment were Erroneous in that Point, it was mis-led by Lords of great Honour and Experience, and by Judges of great knowledge in the Law. But I did nothing to affront any. 'Tis said, <hi>that I inserted into the Sermon, that the People may not refuse any Tax that is not unjustly laid.</hi> I conceive nothing is justly laid in that kind but according to Law; Gods and Mans. And I dare not say, the People may refuse any thing so laid. For <hi>Jus Regis,</hi> the Right of a King, (which is urged against me too) I never went farther than the <hi>Scriptures</hi> lead me; Nor did I ever think, that <hi>Jus</hi>
                        <pb n="357" facs="tcp:54614:190"/>
                        <hi>Regis,</hi> mentioned, 1: <hi>Sam:</hi> 8: is meant of the Ordinary and just Right <hi>of Kings,</hi> but of that Power which, such as <hi>Saul</hi> would be, would assume unto themselves, and make it right by Power. <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 12.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then they say, I expunged some things out of it. As first, <hi>The Sabbath,</hi> and put instead of it <hi>the Lords Day.</hi> What's my Offence? <hi>Sabbath</hi> is the <hi>Jews</hi> Word, and the <hi>Lords-Day</hi> the <hi>Christians.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>about Evil Counseilors to be used as</hi> Haman. The Passage (as there Expressed) was very Scandalous, and without just Cause, upon the Lords of the <hi>Council.</hi> And they might justly have thought I had want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Discretion, should I have left it in. Thirdly, that I expunged this, <hi>that Popery is against the first and the second Commandment.</hi> If I did it, it was because it is much doubted by Learned Men, whether any thing in <hi>Popery</hi> is against the first Commandment, or denies the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the God-head. And Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> (who Charges very home <note place="margin">Perkins Opera, fol. p. <hi>34.</hi>
                        </note> against <hi>Popery)</hi> lays not the Breach of the first Commandment upon them.
<q>
                           <p>And when I gave Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> this Answer. In his last Reply, he asked <hi>why I left out both?</hi> Why, I did it because its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against the second is common and obvious, and I did not think it worthy the standing in such a Sermon, when it could not be  made good against the first.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But they demanded, <hi>why I should make any Animadversions at all upon the Sermon?</hi> It was thus. The Sermon being presented to <hi>his Majesty,</hi> and the Argument not common, he committed the Care of Printing it to Bishop <hi>Mountain,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and four o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; of which I was one. And this was the Reason of the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions</hi> now called mine. As also of the Answer <hi>to my Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors Exceptions</hi> (now Charged also) and called mine. But it was the Joint Answer of the <hi>Committee.</hi> And so is that other Particular al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, <hi>In which the whole Business is left to the Learned in the Laws.</hi> For though the <hi>Animadversions</hi> be in my Hand, yet they were done at and by the <hi>Committee,</hi> only I being puny Bishop, was put to write them in my Hand.</p>
                     <p>The Seventh Charge <hi>was Dr:</hi> Manwaring's <hi>Business and Preferment.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">VII.</note> It was handled before, only resumed here to make a Noise, and so passed it over.</p>
                     <p>The Eighth Charge was concerning <hi>some Alterations in the Prayers</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">VIII.</note> 
                        <hi>made for the Fifth of</hi> November, <hi>and in the Book for the</hi> Fast, <hi>which was Published</hi> An: 1636. <hi>And the Prayers on</hi> Coronation <hi>Day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. First for the <hi>Fast-Book:</hi> The Prayer mentioned was altered, as is Expressed; but it was by him that had the Ordering of that Book to the Press, not by me. Yet I cannot but approve the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son given for it, and that without any the least approbation <hi>of Merit.</hi> For the Abuse of Fasting, by thinking it Meritorious, is the thing left out; whereas in this Age and Kingdom, when, and where, set Fastings of the Church are cryed down, there can be little fear of that Erroneous Opinion of placing any Merit in Fasting.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Secondly, for the Prayers Published <hi>for the Fifth of</hi> November, <hi>and</hi> Coronation <hi>Day.</hi> The Alterations were made either by the <hi>King</hi> himself, or some about him when I was not in Court. And the Books sent me with a Command for the Printing, as there altered. I made stay, till I might wait upon <hi>his Majesty.</hi> I found him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:54614:191"/>
upon the alterations; nor in my judgment could I justly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept against them. <hi>His Majesty</hi> then gave Warrant to the Books themselves with the alterations in them, and so by his Warrant I commanded the Printing. And I then shewed both the Books to the Lords, who Viewed them, and acknowledged <hi>his Ma jesty'</hi> Hand, with which, not his Name only, but the whole Warrant was written.</p>
                     <p>And here I humbly desired three things might be observed, and I still desire it. First, with what Conscience this passage out of my Speech in the <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>p.</hi> 32.</note> Star Chamber was urged against me (for so it was, and fiercely by Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi>) to prove <hi>that I had altered the Oath at the King's Coronation,</hi> because the Prayers appointed for the Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary of the <hi>Coronation</hi> were altered.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Which is absolute <hi>Nonsence.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Secondly, he Charged me <hi>that the Word</hi> Antichristian <hi>was left out.</hi> But that is visibly untrue, for it is left in. Thirdly, that though it be in, <hi>yet that the Alteration takes it off from the</hi> Papist, <hi>as also their Rebellion.</hi> Neither: For the Change is this, <hi>That Antichristian Sect;</hi> altered into <hi>The Antichristian Sect of them which,</hi> &amp;c. and, <hi>whose Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is Rebellion;</hi> altered into <hi>who turn Religion into Rebellion.</hi> By which it is manifest that the alteration takes off neither Imputation from the <hi>Papist,</hi> but moderates both. And for ought I yet know, 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary it should. For if their Religion be Rebellion, see what it will produce. Is not this the Syllogism? The Religion of the <hi>Papist</hi> is Rebellion: But <hi>Christianity</hi> is the Religion of the <hi>Papist:</hi> Therefore <hi>Christianity</hi> is Rebellion. I may not inlarge; but you may see more, if you please, in my Speech in the <note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>p.</hi> 36.</note> Star-Chamber.
<q>
                           <p>And when Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> in the Summ of his Charge pressed these Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions hard against me, he did not so much as mention, that I had <hi>the King's</hi> both Warrant and Command to all that I did in that Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: And besides, urged this as a great Innovation, <hi>because the Prayers mentioned had continued unaltered for the space of above Thirty Years.</hi> Not remembring therewhile, that the Liturgy of the Church Established by Act of Parliament, must be taken away, or altered, though it hath continued above Fourscore. Nay, and <hi>Episcopacy</hi> must be quite abolished, though it have continued in the Church of  <hi>Christ</hi> above Sixteen Hundred.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Ninth Charge was from Sir <hi>Edward Hungerford,</hi> who came to <note place="margin">IX.</note> 
                        <hi>Lambeth</hi> to have a little Book Licensed to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. The Author was Sir <hi>Anthony Hungerford,</hi> whether Sir <hi>Edward's</hi> Grandfather or his Uncle, I remember not the Relation. He says, he came to my Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain Dr: <hi>Bray</hi> to License it. And <hi>that Dr:</hi> Bray <hi>told him there were some harsh Phrases in it, which were better left out, because we were upon a way of winning the</hi> Papists. First, I hope I shall not be made answerable for my Chaplains Words too. And Secondly, I hope there is no harm in winning the <hi>Papists</hi> to the Church of <hi>England:</hi> Especially if so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie a Cure, as avoiding harsh Language would do it. He says, <hi>my Chaplain expressed a dislike of</hi> Guicciardin's <hi>Censure of Pope</hi> Alexander <hi>the Sixth.</hi> Sure if the Censure be false, he had reason to except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it; if true, yet to Publish such an unsavoury Business to the Common-People ........ He says, <hi>he came and complained to me, and that I told him I was not at leisure, but left it to my Chaplain.</hi> So the
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:54614:191"/>
Charge upon me was, <hi>That my Chaplain was in an Errour concerning this Book, and I would not Redress it.</hi> To this I answerd: First, that my Chaplain was Dead, and I not knowing the Reasons which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to refuse Licensing this Book, can neither confess him to be in an Errour, nor yet justifie him. Secondly, for my own refusing to meddle with it. Sir <hi>Edward</hi> took me in a time of business, when I could not attend it. Thirdly, if I had absolutely refused it, and left it to my Chaplain, I had done no more than all my Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors did before me. And Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> then witnessed to <hi>the Lords,</hi> that Arch-Bishop <hi>Abbot,</hi> my immediate Predecessor, and to whom the Doctor was Household Chaplain, would never meddle with Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Books, but ever referred them to his Chaplains: And Dr. <hi>Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,</hi> another of his Chaplains (well known to Dr. <hi>Featly</hi>) suffered for a Book sharply; yet not one Word said to my Predecessor about it. Fourthly, as the Liberty of the Press is in <hi>England,</hi> and of the Books which are tendred to the Press, the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> had better Grind, than take that Work to his own Hands, especially consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his many and necessary Avocations. Lastly, no Man ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to me in this kind, but this Gentleman only. So it is one only single Offence, if it be any.
<q>
                           <p>But how this or the rest should be Treason against Sir <hi>Edward Hungerford,</hi> I cannot yet see. And so I answered Mr. <hi>Brown;</hi> who in his Summary Charge forgot not this: But Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> laid load upon me in his Reply, in  such Language as I am willing to forget.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Tenth Charge was out of a Paper of <hi>Considerations</hi> to Dr. <note place="margin">X.</note> 
                        <hi>Potter,</hi> about some few passages in his Answer to a Book Intituled <hi>Charity mistaken.</hi> The Business this. Dr: <hi>Potter</hi> writ to me for my Advice: I used not to be Peremptory; but put some few things back to his farther consideration. Of which, three were now Charged upon me. The first was, he used this phrase <hi>Believe in</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                        <hi>the Pope.</hi> I desired him to consider of (<hi>In</hi>) And in this I yet know not wherein I offend. The Second, was this Phrase, <hi>The Idol of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                        <hi>Rome.</hi> I advised him to consider this Phrase too, that Men might not be to seek what that Idol was.
<q>
                           <p>And here Mr: <hi>Nicolas</hi> cryed out with vehemency, <hi>That every Boy in the Street could tell the</hi> Pope <hi>was the Idol.</hi> I had not Dr: <hi>Potter's</hi> Book now at hand; and so could not be certain in what Sense <hi>the Doctor</hi> used it; but else, as many at least, think <hi>the Mass</hi> the Idol of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>the Pope:</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Mr: <hi>Nicolas</hi> his Boys in the Streets think otherwise, and then  I cannot blame him for following such mature Judgments.</p>
                        </q>
The Third was, That I bid him consider whether <hi>the Passage p.</hi> 27. (as <note place="margin">3.</note> I remember) <hi>did not give as much Power to the Parliament in matter of Doctrine, as the Church.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>But my Answer to this I shall put off to the Charge against me concerning Parliaments, because there Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> began with this. The two former he Charged also, and I answered them as before. But he omitted, that I obtained of <hi>the Lords</hi> the reading of Dr. <hi>Potter's</hi> Letter to me, by which he drew from me those Things which I determined not, but only put to his Second Thoughts and Consideration. In which way (I humbly conceive) I cannot be in <hi>Crime,</hi> though I were in <hi>Errour.</hi> Here ended  the Business of this Day, and I was Ordered to attend again <hi>June</hi> 27.</p>

                     <p>The Second Charge, was <hi>certain Expunctions of some things</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">II.</note> 
                        <hi>against the Papists in Dr:</hi> Clark's <hi>Sermons.</hi> The Witness which Swore to the passages left out, was one Mr: <hi>White</hi> a Minister, and it seems some near Acquaintance of Dr: <hi>Clark's.</hi> But First, this Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is single. Secondly, he brought only a Paper, in which he had written down what was Expunged; but Dr: <hi>Clark's</hi> Sermons he brought not with it: So 'tis not impossible he might be mistaken: Howsoever, I not having the Book, could not possibly make an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute and a perfect Answer. Thirdly, this Witness confesses, that Dr: <hi>Weeks,</hi> then Chaplain to my Lord of <hi>London,</hi> had the view of Dr: <hi>Clark's</hi> Sermons, and took Exceptions against some passages, as well as my Chaplain Dr: <hi>Haywood</hi> did. So it seems there was cause for it. Fourthly, I Answer, that for this, and for all other of like Nature, my Chaplain must Answer for his own Act, and not I. He is Living, and an Able Man; I humbly desire he may be called to his Account. For 'tis not possible for me to tell <hi>your Lordships,</hi> upon what grounds he did Expunge these many and different passages, which are instanced against me. Lastly, in all the passages of Dr: <hi>Clark's</hi> Sermons, it is not any where distinguished, which were Expunged by my Chaplain, and which by Dr: <hi>Weeks:</hi> So that the Charge in that behalf, is left very uncertain.</p>
                     <p>For the passages themselves, as they are many, so they are such as may easily be mistaken, the most of them. And whether Dr: <hi>Clark</hi> handled them in such manner as was not justifiable, either against <hi>Arminius</hi> or the <hi>Papists,</hi> cannot possibly be known, till each place in the Book be Examined for the <hi>Thing,</hi> and my Chaplain Dr: <hi>Haywood</hi> for the <hi>Meaning.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>This made a great noise in Mr: <hi>Brown's</hi> Summary Charge against me, he alledging, that two and twenty Passages about Points of <hi>Popery</hi> were dashed out of Dr: <hi>Clark's</hi> Sermons. To which I Answer'd, that I conceived my Chaplain would be able to make it good, there were two hundred left in for two and twenty left out. And that they which were left out, were not some way or other justifiable against the <hi>Papists,</hi> as set down and expressed by him. And if so, they are better out than in. For we gain nothing by urging that against the <hi>Papists,</hi> which, when it comes to the Touch, cannot be made good against  them.</p>

One Passage is here added out of Dr. <hi>Featly's</hi> Sermons, <hi>p.</hi> 225. Where he inveighs against <hi>too much imbellishing and beautifying the Church, and not the Souls of Men,</hi> &amp;c. First, if there be not a care to beautifie the Soul, let Men profess what Religion they will, 'tis a just Exception, and I believe no fault found with that. But Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for the over-much beautifying of the Church, 'tis a Point that might well be left out. Little necessity, God knows, to Preach or Print against too much adorning of Churches among us, where yet so many Churches lye very nastily in many places of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and no one too much adorned to be found. Nay, the very Consecration of Churches cryed down (as is before expressed.) And this Opinion, <hi>that no Place is Holy but during the Service in it,</hi> made Mr. <hi>Culmer,</hi> though a Minister, to piss in <hi>the Cathedral Church</hi> of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> And divers others to do so, and more, against the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in St: <hi>Paul's</hi> nearer hand, as may daily be both seen and smelt, to the shame of that which is called Religion.
<q>
                           <p>Here Mr: <hi>Nicolas</hi> would fain have shovell'd it to the out-side of the Church (which had been bad enough) but it was the inside I spake of, and the  thing is known.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Then an Instance was made in a Book of Dr: <hi>Jones.</hi> The Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that any thing was Expunged out of this, was only Mr: <hi>Chetwin.</hi> And he confesses that this Book was Licensed by Dr: <hi>Baker,</hi> and he my Lord of <hi>London's</hi> Chaplain, not mine. Here my Friends at the Bar infer, <hi>that Dr:</hi> Baker <hi>was preferred by me.</hi> First, that's not so, he was preferred by his own Lord. Secondly, if he had been prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by me, it could have made no Charge, unless proof had been made that I preferred him for abusing Dr. <hi>Jones</hi> his Book. And for the <hi>Docket,</hi> which is the only Proof offer'd that I preferred him, I have already shewed, that that is no Proof. Yea, but they say, Dr: <hi>Baker was imployed by me as one of my Visitors.</hi> And what then? Must I be answerable for every fault that is committed by every Man that I employ in my Visitation, though it be a fault committed at another time and place, though I humbly desire Dr. <hi>Baker</hi> may An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for himself, before I acknowledge any fault committed by him?
<q>
                           <p>And though I conceive this Answer abundantly satisfactory for any thing that may concern me, yet Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> omitted not this  Instance against me.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Third Charge was personally against my self, and taken <note place="margin">III.</note> out of my <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>p.</hi> 47.</note> Speech in the Star-Chamber. The words these. <hi>The Altar is the greatest place of God's Residence upon Earth, greater than the Pulpit; for there 'tis</hi> Hoc est Corpus meum, <hi>this is my Body; but in the other it is at most, but</hi> Hoc est Verbum meum, <hi>this is my Word: And a greater Reverence is due to the Body, than the Word of the Lord.</hi> Out of this place, Mr: <hi>Nicolas</hi> would needs inforce, that I maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Transubstantiation;</hi> because I say <hi>There,</hi> 'tis <hi>Hoc est Corpus meum.</hi> First, I perceive by him, he confounds (as too many else do) <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation</hi> with the <hi>Real Presence,</hi> whereas these have a wide diff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence. And <hi>Calvin</hi> grants a Real and True Presence, yea, and he grants <hi>Realiter</hi> too; and yet no Man a greater Enemy to <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> than he.

Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> avows as much. And Secondly, the Word (<hi>There</hi>) makes nothing against this. For after the Words of Consecration are past, be the Minister never so Unworthy, yet 'tis infallibly <hi>Hoc</hi>

<q>
                           <p>And as Preaching goes now, scarce is any thing heard from many in two long Hours, that  sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the Word of God.</p>
                        </q>
And St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. of <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 92.</note> a great Sin committed in his Time, <hi>of not discerning the Lord's Body,</hi> when Unworthy Communicants received it.

                           <p>Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> in his Summary Charge pressed this also upon me. I answer'd as before, and added, that in all Ages of the Church, the Touchstone of Religion was not to Hear the Word Preached, but to Communicate. And at this day, many will come and hear Sermons, who yet will not receive the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion together.

                     <p>Another passage taken out of my <note n="*" place="margin">p. <hi>49.</hi>
                        </note> Speech was; <hi>That due Reverence be given to God and to his Altar.</hi> Hence Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> infers again: <hi>This Reverence is one joint Act, therefore 'tis Divine to the Altar, as well as to God, and so Idolatry.</hi> First, the very next words in my Speech are, that this Reverence to the Altar comes <hi>far short of Divine Worship.</hi> What can prevent an Objection, if such plain words cannot? Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, having thus plainly expressed it; he may infer too if he will, that I do not then Worship God. For this Reverence is one joint Act; but 'tis confessed, that 'tis not Divine Worship to the Altar, and therefore not to God.
<q>
                           <p>But Thirdly, this Gentleman, by his Favour, understands not the Mysteries which lye hid in many parts of  Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</p>
                        </q>
In this for one. For when this Reverence is performed, 'tis to God as to the Creator, and so Divine: But 'tis only <hi>toward,</hi> not <hi>to</hi> the Altar, and so far short. And though in outward performance it be one joint Act, yet that which is not <hi>separated,</hi> is, and must be distinguished one from the other.

                     <p>The Fourth Charge, <hi>Is the Licensing of</hi> Sales, <hi>and other Books which</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">IV.</note> 
                        <hi>had</hi> Popery <hi>in them, by my Chaplain Dr.</hi> Haywood. 1. To this Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> (who is the single witness) says, <hi>That he tender'd a Bill to the then Lord</hi> Keeper <hi>against my Chaplain for Licensing this Book, and that his Lordship refused it.</hi> If the <hi>Lord Keeper Coventry</hi> refused his Bill, I believe, were he living, he would assign just Cause why he did it. But whatever Cause he had, it concerns not me, that he rejected the Bill. Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> says farther, <hi>That this Book of</hi> Sales <hi>was Printed heretofore, but purged first by Dr.</hi> James; <hi>but Licensed now by Dr.</hi> Haywood, <hi>not according to that Purgation, but with all the Points of</hi> Popery <hi>in.</hi> For this he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces Mr. <hi>Oaks,</hi> whose Son printed it. And says farther, <hi>That his Correcter at the Press found fault with some passages, and thereupon he was sent to Dr.</hi> Haywood, <hi>who returned answer</hi> (as they say) <hi>That if he Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed it, he would justifie it. And that his Son told him this.</hi> First, <hi>My Lords,</hi> this Under-Testimony of Mr. <hi>Oakes</hi> produced by Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> is nothing but a Hearsay from his Son, who is now dead, and cannot be Examined, and while he was living ran away and would not be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined. Secondly, this was a most notable piece of Villany practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed against my Chaplain, and thorough his sides against me. It was thus, <hi>My Lords.</hi> Whether the Bill were rejected or no, I cannot tell; but the Complaint of Printing this Book came publickly into the <hi>Star-Chamber.</hi> And then was the first time that ever I heard of it. I then humbly desired their Lordships that Dr. <hi>Haywood</hi> might answer what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he had done amiss, either there or where they pleased. The Court presently commanded Mr. <hi>Atturny Bankes</hi> to call all Parties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, examine them thoroughly, and then give his Account what he found; that the Court might proceed farther according to Justice. Dr. <hi>Haywood</hi> appeared, and shewed Mr. <hi>Atturney</hi> how he had Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>Sales</hi> in all Popish Points before he Licensed it. But young <hi>Oakes,</hi> and he which brought <hi>Sales</hi> to be Licensed (who was then thought to be some <hi>Jesuited</hi> Recusant, and, as I remember, Lodged for that time of Printing, in <hi>Oakes</hi> his House) ran both away, or hid their Heads, and would not be found. And this was a meer Plot of this Recusant, if not Priest, to have <hi>Sales</hi> Printed, with all his Points of <hi>Popery</hi> in him, to work mischief to my Chaplain and my self. And young <hi>Oakes</hi> was in all likelihood well payed for his pains. This Account Mr. <hi>Atturney</hi> brought into that Court, and this Relation Dr. <hi>Haywood</hi> (who I obtained might be after sent for) attested at this Barr.</p>
                     <p>One Circumstance my old decayed Memory mistook. For I thought, and so at first told <hi>the Lords,</hi> that for this Clamor raised upon him in this way, I did soon after dismiss him my House. But after, I found that he was gone out of my House before. Howsoever I left him, without any Mediation, to the Justice of the Court. And here I may not forget that which I then observed to <hi>the Lords,</hi> that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as 'tis urged, that many Points of <hi>Popery</hi> have passed the Press; 'tis no wonder, if such Art be used as was here to get out <hi>Sales.</hi> And this farther is observable, that all these <hi>Quotations of Popish Opinions,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned here to fill up the noise, are out of four or five Books at the most, of which more are out of this <hi>Sales</hi> than all the rest.

in he was, as soon as known. Which Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> in the Summ  of his Charge acknowledges.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. After <hi>Sales,</hi> the next Instance was in a <hi>Book</hi> Intituled, <hi>Christ's Epistle to the Devout Reader.</hi> Four particular Points were urged out of this: But neither I, nor my Chaplains had ought to do with it. For it was Licensed at <hi>London House</hi> by Dr. <hi>Weeks.</hi> Nor was there ever any complaint brought to me to have it called in: Nor was any such Proof so much as offer'd.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Third Instance was of a Book called the <hi>Female Glory,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> (who is single again) said that <hi>Dr.</hi> Heylin <hi>answered Mr.</hi> Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, <hi>and justified all the Passages in this Book.</hi> And added, <hi>that this was by my direction.</hi> But upon my Motion at the Barr concerning the boldness of this Oath, Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> recalled himself, and said that I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him to answer Mr. <hi>Burton.</hi> But it is one thing to appoint him to answer Mr. <hi>Burton:</hi> And another to direct him to justifie all passages in the <hi>Female Glory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Fourth Instance was in a Letter sent to me from one <hi>Crox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> a young Divine in <hi>Ireland.</hi> He was bred in St. <hi>John's</hi> College in <hi>Oxford.</hi> At the Lord <hi>Mount-Norris</hi> his Intreaty I sent <hi>Croxton</hi> into <hi>Ireland</hi> to be his Chaplain. If he miscarried there, I could not help it, nor hinder his writing of a Letter to me, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seribe what he should write in it. But, to my remembrance, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of any Miscarriage of his in matter of Religion. And whether he be living or dead, I know not. That Letter indeed hath a Cross at the top of it. But then was another Letter of his shewed without a Cross, in which he calls <hi>Rome Monstrum A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominandum.</hi> Howsoever I conceive all this is nothing to me.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Fifth Instance was a Book, which they said was Licensed by Dr. <hi>Weeks.</hi> And if so, then not by my Chaplain. But upon peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, I find no License Printed to it, nor to any of the other, but only to <hi>Sales,</hi> which is answered.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Sixth Instance was in Bishop <hi>Mountague's</hi> Books, the <hi>Gagg,</hi> and the <hi>Appeal.</hi> Here they said, that <hi>Dr.</hi> White <hi>told Dr.</hi> Featly, <hi>that five or six Bishops did allow these Books.</hi> But he did not name me to be one of them. Then Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> urged upon his Oath, <hi>that these Books were found in my Study.</hi> And I cannot but bless my self at this Argument. For I have <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in my Study; Therefore I am a <hi>Papist:</hi> Or I have the <hi>Alcaron</hi> in my Study; Therefore I am a <hi>Turk,</hi> is as good an Argument as this; I have Bishop <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague's</hi> Books in my Study; Therefore I am an <hi>Arminian.</hi> May Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> have Books in all kinds in his Study, and may not the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> have them in his? Yea, but he says, <hi>there is a Letter of the Bishops to me, submitting his Books to my Censure.</hi> This Letter hath no date, and so belike Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> thought he might be bold both with it and his Oath, and apply it to what Books he pleas'd. But as God would have it, there are Circumstances in it as good as a Date. For 'tis therein expressed, that he was now ready to remove from <hi>Chichester</hi> to <hi>Norwich.</hi> Therefore he must needs speak of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting those his Books to me, which were then ready to be set out, which were his <hi>Origines Ecclesiasticae,</hi> not the <hi>Gagg,</hi> nor the <hi>Appeal,</hi>
                        <pb n="365" facs="tcp:54614:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which are the Books Charged, and which were Printed divers Years before he was made a Bishop; and my Receit indorsed upon it is <hi>Mar.</hi> 29. 1638. And I hope Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> will not call this <hi>the Colour of an Answer,</hi> as he hath called many of the rest given by me.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Seventh Instance was in a Book Licensed by Dr. <hi>Martin,</hi> then my Chaplain in <hi>London-House. This Book Mr.</hi> Pryn <hi>says, was purposely set out to Countenance</hi> Arminianism, <hi>as if it had been some Work of Moment, whereas it was answered twice in the</hi> Queens <hi>Time.</hi> If Dr: <hi>Martin</hi> did this, 'tis more than I remember; nor can I so long after give any Account of it. But Dr: <hi>Martin</hi> is Living and in Town, and I humbly desired he might be called to answer. He was called the next Day, and gave this Account.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>The Account is wanting; a Space left for it, but not filled up.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> says farther, <hi>that after this he Preached</hi> Arminianism <hi>at S.</hi> Paul's <hi>Cross.</hi> Why did not Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> come then to me, and acquaint me with it? Which neither he nor any Man else did. And I was in Attendance at Court, whither I could not hear him. And the Charge which came against him upon the next Days Hearing, was this and no more; That one then Preached at the Cross <hi>Vniversal Redemption;</hi> but he that gave Testimony, knew him not; only he says, <hi>one told him 'twas Dr:</hi> Martin.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The last Instance was <hi>of a Bible commonly Sold, with a</hi> Popish <hi>Table at the end of it.</hi> This is more than I know, or ever heard till now; nor was any Complaint ever brought to me of it. And I cannot know all things that are done abroad for Gain; for that will teach them to conceal, as well as move them to act. Yet one of the <hi>Popish</hi> Heads mentioned in that Table, was <hi>Confirmation,</hi> which is commanded in our Church Liturgy, and ratified by Law.</p>
                     <p>Here this day ended, and I was ordered to appear again <hi>July</hi> 4. <note place="margin">Julij <hi>4.</hi>
                        </note> That Day I received a Note, under Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> his Hand, that they meant to proceed upon the 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 14th. <hi>Original Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> and the Sixth and Seventh <hi>Additionals.</hi> The last Warrant for other Articles, came under Serjeant <hi>Wild's</hi> Hand, and Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> signing this, it seems, mistook. For the Eighth and Ninth <hi>Original Articles</hi> are in part proceeded on before. Now they go forward with these, and then on to the rest, which I will write down seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally as they come to them.</p>
                     <p>The same Day, being <hi>Thursday,</hi> all my Books at <hi>Lambeth</hi> were by Order of the House of <hi>Commons</hi> taken away by Mr. ....... Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary to the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and carried I know not whither, but are (as 'tis commonly said) for the use of Mr: <hi>Peters.</hi> Before this time, some good Number of my Books were delivered to the use of the <hi>Synod,</hi> the Ministers which had them giving no Catalogue under their Hands, which or how many they had. And all this was done contrary to an Order of <hi>the Lords,</hi> bearing Date <hi>Novemb.</hi> 9. 1642. for the safe keeping of my Books there: And before I was Convicted off any Crime. This Day also I received an Order, which put off my Hearing to the next Day.</p>

                           <hi>Julij</hi> 5. 1644. <hi>Friday.</hi>
                        </note> was, <hi>that I had preferred none to Bishopricks, Deaneries, prebends, and Benefices, but Men Popishly affected, or otherwise unworthy.</hi> And <note place="margin">I.</note> some they named. <note place="margin">Die Diceimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>septimo.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. As First, Dr: <hi>Manwaring, Disabled by the Parliament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, Mr: <hi>Mountague, Excepted against by Parliament.</hi> But for these, no Proof was now brought. They referred themselves to what was said before, and so do I. And where they go to prove only by <hi>Dockets,</hi> I desire it may still be remembred that the <hi>Docket</hi> is a full Proof who gave Order for drawing the Bill at the Signet Office: But no Proof at all who procured the Preferment.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Bishop <hi>Corbet.</hi> But the Earl of <hi>Dorset</hi> got my Lord Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to prefer him, to make way for Dr. <hi>Duppa,</hi> his deserving Chaplain into <hi>Christ-Church.</hi> Nor was any thing Charged against Dr: <hi>Corbet,</hi> but that he was preferred by me.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Fourthly, Bishop <hi>Pierce:</hi> Against whom there was no Proof of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered neither. And he is living to answer it, if any be.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Nor was there now any Proof offered against Bishop <hi>Wren,</hi> who was named also; at the least not till he was made a Bishop. So if I did prefer him, it seems I did it when nothing was laid against him. And if after he had his Preferment, he did any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, that could not I foresee; and he is living to answer it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Sixth was Bishop <hi>Lindsy,</hi> a Man known to be of great and universal Learning, but preferred by the then Lord Treasurer <hi>Portland,</hi> not by me. Him they Charged with <hi>Arminianism.</hi> The Witnesses two: The First, Mr. <hi>Smart;</hi> he is positive: He was his Fellow Prebendary at <hi>Durham.</hi> There was Animosity between them.
<q>
                           <p>And <hi>Smart,</hi> not able to Judge of <hi>Arminianism.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </q>
Secondly, Mr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> who could say nothing, but that he heard so much from some Ministers, and Dr. <hi>Bastwick.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>So here is as Learned a Man as <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom</hi> had any of his time, Debased in this great and Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Court, by <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and a <hi>Hearsay.</hi> And that, when the Man  is gone to that which should be his Quiet, the Grave.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Seventh was Arch-Bishop <hi>Neile,</hi> a Man well known to be as true to, and as stout for the Church of <hi>England</hi> established by Law, as any Man that came to Preferment in it. Nor could his great Enemy Mr. <hi>Smart</hi> say any thing now against him, but a Hearsay from one Dr. <hi>Moor</hi> of <hi>Winchester.</hi> And I cannot but profess, it grieves me much, to hear so many Honest and Worthy Men so used, when the Grave hath shut up their Mouths from answering for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The next was Dr: <hi>Cosin,</hi> to be Dean of <hi>Peterborough.</hi> I named Four of <hi>his Majesty's</hi> Chaplains to him, as he had Commanded me.
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:54614:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And <hi>the King</hi> pitched upon Dr. <hi>Cosens,</hi> in regard all the Means he then had, lay in, and about <hi>Duresm,</hi> and was then in the <hi>Scots</hi> Hands; so that he had nothing but Forty Pound a Year by his Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in <hi>Peter-House</hi> to maintain himself, his Wife and Children.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The Ninth was Dr. <hi>Potter,</hi> a known <hi>Arminian,</hi> to the Deanery of <hi>Worcester.</hi> What Proof of this? Nothing but the <hi>Docket.</hi> And what of the Crime? Nothing but Dr. <hi>Featly's</hi> Testimony; who says no more but this, That Dr. <hi>Potter</hi> was at first against <hi>Arminianism,</hi> (that's Absolute) But afterwards he defended it, as he hath heard: (there's a Hearsay.)</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The Tenth was Dr: <hi>Baker.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11. The Eleventh Dr: <hi>Weeks.</hi> Both very Honest and Able Men; but Preferred by their own Lord, the Lord Bishop of <hi>London.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12. The Twelfth was Dr: <hi>Bray.</hi> He had been my Chaplain above Ten Years in my House; I found him a very Able and an Honest Man, and had reason to Prefer him to be able to Live well; and I did so. Here is nothing objected against him, but his Expungings, and not Expungings of some Books; which if he were Living, I well hope he would be able to give good Account for.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The Thirteenth Dr: <hi>Heylin.</hi> He is known to be a Learned and an Able Man; but for his Preferment, both to be <hi>his Majesty's</hi> Chaplain, and for that which he got in that Service, he owes it under God to the Memory of the <hi>Earl of Danby,</hi> who took care of him in the University.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. After these, they named some, whom they said I preferred to be <hi>the King's</hi> Chaplains. The Witness here Mr. <hi>Oldsworth,</hi> the Lord <hi>Chamberlain's</hi> Secretary. He says, <hi>the Power and Practice of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Chaplains was in the Lord</hi> Chamberlain <hi>for these</hi> 25. <hi>Years.</hi> And I say, 'tis so still, for ought I know. He says, <hi>that in all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which the Lord</hi> Chamberlain's <hi>Warrant went in this Form;</hi> These are to will and require you, &amp;c. <hi>that there his Lordship did it without consulting</hi> the King; <hi>and that the Warrant for Chaplains run all in this Form.</hi> First, this is more than I know or ever heard of till now. Secondly, be it so; yet 'tis hard to deny <hi>the King</hi> to hear Men Preach before they be sworn his Chaplains,
<q>
                           <p>if <hi>his Majesty</hi> desire it, since it argues a great care in <hi>the King,</hi> especially in such a Factious time,  as began to overlay this Church.</p>
                        </q>
Thirdly, he confesses, <hi>that he knows not who put the King upon this way; but believes that I did it.</hi> He is single, and his belief only is no Evidence.
<q>
                           <p>And whosoever gave <hi>the King</hi> that Advice, deserved very well both of <hi>his Majesty</hi> and the Church of <hi>England:</hi> That none might be put about him in that Service, but such as himself should approve of. But that which troubled this Witness, was another thing. He had not Money for every one that was made Chaplain; nor Money to get them a Month to wait in; nor Money to change their Month, if it were inconvenient for their other Occasions; nor Money for sparing their Attendance, when they pleased. In which, and other things, I would he had been as careful of his Lord's Honour, as I have been in all things. For 'tis well known in Court, I obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved  his Lordship as much as any Man.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Men which are instanced in, are Dr: <hi>Heylin.</hi> But he was
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:54614:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>
preferred to that Service by my Lord the Earl of <hi>Danby.</hi> Then Dr. <hi>Potter.</hi> But the Lord Keeper <hi>Coventry</hi> was his means. Dr. <hi>Cosens</hi> was preferred by Bishop <hi>Neile,</hi> whose Chaplain he had been many Years, and he moved <hi>the Lord Chamberlain</hi> for it. Dr: <hi>Lawrence</hi> was my <hi>Lord Chamberlain's</hi> own Chaplain, and preferred by himself; and in all likelyhood, by Mr. <hi>Oldsworth's</hi> means: For he was Fellow of <hi>Magdalen College</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Oldsworth</hi> himself was, and he once (to my Knowledge) had a great Opinion of him. Dr. <hi>Haywood</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was my Chaplain; but I preferred him not to <hi>his Majesty,</hi> till he had Preached divers times in Court with great Approbation; nor then, but with my Lord <hi>Chamberlain's</hi> Love and Liking. As for Dr. <hi>Pocklington,</hi> I know not who recommended him; nor is there any Proof offered that I did it.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Then they proceeded to my own Chaplains. They name Four of them: First Dr. <hi>Weeks.</hi> But he was never in my House, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver medled with the Licensing of any Books, till he was gone from me to the Bishop of <hi>London:</hi> So he is charged with no Fault, so long as he was mine. The Second, Dr: <hi>Haywood.</hi> But he is charged with nothing but <hi>Sales,</hi> which was a most desperate Plot against him, as is before shewed. The Third was Dr. <hi>Martin.</hi> Against him came Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> for his <hi>Arminian</hi> Sermon at S. <hi>Pauls Cross.</hi> But that's answered before. And Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> who said, <hi>he proposed</hi> Arminian <hi>Questions to divers Ministers.</hi> Belike, such as were to be examined by him. But he adds, <hi>as these Ministers told him.</hi> So 'tis but a Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say. And say he did propose such Questions; may it not be fit enough to try how able they were to answer them? The Fourth was Dr. <hi>Bray.</hi> Against him Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> was again produced, <hi>for that which he had expunged out of his Sermons.</hi> But when I saw this so often incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to make a noise, I humbly desired of <hi>the Lords,</hi> that I might ask Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> one Question: Upon leave granted, I asked him, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nothing were of late expunged out of a <hi>Book</hi> of his written against a Priest? and desired him to speak upon the Oath he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. He answered roundly, <hi>that divers passages against the</hi> Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists, <hi>and some in defence of the Liturgy of the Church of</hi> England <hi>were expunged:</hi> I asked, by whom? He said, <hi>by Mr.</hi> Rouse <hi>and the Committee,</hi> or, <hi>by Mr.</hi> Rouse <hi>or the Committee.</hi> Be it which it will, I observed to <hi>the Lords,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> and the <hi>Committee</hi> might expunge Passages against <hi>the Anabaptists,</hi> nay, <hi>for the Liturgy</hi> establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Law; but my Chaplains may not expunge any thing against the <hi>Papists,</hi> though perhaps mistaken.</p>
                     <p>From thence, they fell upon Men, whom they said I had prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Benefices. They named but Two. Dr: <hi>Heylin</hi> was one again, whom I preferred not. The other was Dr: <hi>Jackson,</hi> the late Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> College in <hi>Oxford.</hi> Dr: <hi>Featly</hi> being produced, said, <hi>Dr:</hi> Jackson <hi>was a known Arminian.</hi> If so to him, 'tis well: The Man is Dead, and cannot answer for himself. Thus far I can for him, without medling with any his Opinions. He was very Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and very Learned, and at those Years he was of, might deserve more than a Poor Benefice.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. Here Mr: <hi>Pryn</hi> came in again, and Testified very boldly, <hi>that I gave many Benefices, which were in the Gift of the</hi> Master of the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:54614:196"/>
Wards: <hi>And all Preferments, only to such Men as were for Ceremonies, Popery and Arminianism.</hi> For the First of these two, the Business was thus: There arose a Difference between the then <hi>Lord Keeper Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> and <hi>the Lord Cottington,</hi> then <hi>Master of the Wards,</hi> about the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of those Benefices. It grew somewhat high, and came to Hearing by the <hi>King</hi> himself: His <hi>Majesty,</hi> upon Hearing, gave the right of Sealing to the <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi> but for the time, till more might appear, reserved the Giving to himself; that he might have some of those lesser Preferments to bestow on such Ministers as attended upon his Navy then at Sea. I never gave any one of these Benefices in my Life. And that this Story is of Truth, <hi>the Lord Cottington</hi> is yet living, and can Witness it.
<q>
                           <p>And this very Answer I gave to Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> who in summing up the Charge laid this also upon me,  and without mentioning what Answer I gave to it.</p>
                        </q>
For the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <hi>that I preferred none but such Men.</hi> 'Tis known I preferred Bishop <hi>Hall</hi> to <hi>Exeter;</hi> Dr. <hi>Potter</hi> to <hi>Carlile;</hi> Dr. <hi>Cook</hi> to <hi>Bristol</hi> first, and then to <hi>Hereford;</hi> That I gave Dr. <hi>Westfield</hi> the Archdeaconry of S. <hi>Albans;</hi> that I was Dr. <hi>Fells</hi> means for <hi>Christ-Church;</hi> and Dr. <hi>Higgs</hi> his for the Deanery of <hi>Litchfield;</hi> that I setled Dr. <hi>Downing</hi> at <hi>Hackney;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Herrick</hi> at <hi>Manchester,</hi> when the Broad Seal for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly given him was questioned: That I gave two of my own Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to Mr. <hi>Palmer,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> two of the now <hi>Synod;</hi> an <hi>Hospital</hi> to Dr: <hi>Jackson</hi> of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> and a Benefice to his Son in Law, at his Suit: I could not Name all these upon the sudden, yet some I did; and no one of them guilty of this Charge in the least.
<q>
                           <p>Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> in his Summary said, <hi>I could name but one or two.</hi> And when in my Answer made in the House of <hi>Commons,</hi> I specified more, among which Mr: <hi>Palmer</hi> was one: Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> said in his Reply, <hi>that Mr:</hi> Palmer <hi>had indeed his Benesice of my giving, so himself told him; but it was at the Entreaty of a great Noble-Man.</hi> Say it were; Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> was then a stranger to me: Some body must speak, and assure me of his Wants and Worth, or I cannot give. But if upon this I give it freely, is it worth no thanks from him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a Noble-Man spake to me? Let Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> rank this Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude  among his other Vertues.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="17">17. From hence they stepped over into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and objected <hi>my preferring of Dr:</hi> Chappel <hi>to be Master of the College at</hi> Dublin. Here the first Witness is Mr. <hi>Walker.</hi> He says, <hi>that all his Scholars were Arminians.</hi> This is a great sign, but not full Proof. He says, <hi>that Dr.</hi> Chappel <hi>was at First fierce against them, but afterward changed his Mind.</hi> Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> said the like of Dr. <hi>Potter.</hi> Some say <hi>Arminius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was at first Zealous against those Opinions, but studying hard to confute them, changed his own Mind.
<q>
                           <p>Take heed, Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi>  do not Study these Points too hard.</p>
                        </q>
For my own part, Dr. <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> was a <hi>Cambridge</hi> Man, altogether unknown to me, save that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from thence great Testimony of his Abilities, and fitness for Government, which that College then extreamly wanted: And no Man ever complained to me, that he favoured <hi>Arminianism.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other Witness was Dr. <hi>Hoyle,</hi> a Fellow of the College in <hi>Dublin.</hi> He says, <hi>that the Doctor did maintain in that</hi> College <hi>Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Works; and in</hi> Christ-Church <hi>Arminianism.</hi> In this he is
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:54614:197"/>
single: But if it be true, why did not the Lord Primate of <hi>Armagh</hi> Punish him? for he says he knew it. <hi>That he opposed some things in the Synod.</hi> And it may be there was just Cause for it. Lastly, he says, <hi>the late Lord</hi> Deputy <hi>liked not the</hi> Irish <hi>Articles; but gave them an Honourable Burial, as</hi> (he says) <hi>the Lord</hi> Primate <hi>himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed.</hi> I am a stranger to all this; nor doth Dr. <hi>Hoyle</hi> charge any thing against me; but says, <hi>that they which did this, were supposed to have some Friend in</hi> England. And surely their Carriage was very <hi>ill,</hi> if they had none.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. Then <hi>were Letters read of my Lord</hi> Primate's <hi>to me, in which is Testified my Care of the Patrimony of that Church. And then a Paper of Instructions given by me to the Lord</hi> Deputy <hi>at his first going into that Kingdom.</hi> For the First; though it be thrust in here, among matters of Religion, yet I pray <hi>your Lordships</hi> to consider, 'tis about the Patrimony of that Church only. And I thank them heartily for producing it. For in this Letter is a full confession of my <hi>Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate's,</hi> that the motion of getting the Impropriations from <hi>his Majesty</hi> (formerly objected against me) proceeded from him, as I then plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And the Letter was read. For the Second; my <hi>Lord Deputy,</hi> a little before his first going into <hi>Ireland,</hi> asked me what Service I would command him for the Church there? I humbly thanked him, as I had reason, and told him I would bethink my self, and give him my Thoughts in Writing: These are they which are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Instructions.</hi> They are only for the good of that poor Church, as your Lordships have heard them. This was all; and herein my Lord shewed his Honour, and I did but my Duty.
<q>
                           <p>Though I very  well understand, why this Paper is produced against me.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this they proceeded to the Eleventh <hi>Original Article,</hi> which follows <hi>in haec Verba.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <q>
                        <p n="11">
                           <hi>11.</hi> He in his own Person, and his Suffragans, Visitors, Surrogates, Chancellors, or other Officers by his Command, have caused divers Learned, Pious and Orthodox Preachers of God's Word, to be Silenced, Suspended, Deprived, Degraded, Excommunicated, or otherwise Grieved and Vexed, without any just and lawful Cause; whereby, and by divers other means, he hath hindred the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God's Word, caused divers of his Majesty's Loyal Subjects to forsake the Kingdom, and Increased and Cherished Ignorance and Prophaneness among the People, that so he might the better facilitate the way to the effecting of his own Wicked and Traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Design of Altering and Corrupting the true Religion here Established.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p n="1">1. The First Instance to make good this Article, <hi>was a Repetition of some Lecturers before-named.</hi> But when they thought they had made Noise enough, they referred the Lords to their Notes; and so did I to my former Answers.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Second Instance was out of some <hi>Articles</hi> of Bishop <hi>Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue</hi> and Bishop <hi>Wrenn,</hi> and their <hi>Account</hi> given to me. Bishop <hi>Wrenn, Art:</hi> 16: Speaks of the <hi>Afternoon Sermons being turned into Catechising.</hi> And <hi>Art:</hi> 5: (of his <hi>Account</hi> I take it) <hi>that no Lecture in his Diocess after,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:54614:197"/>
It was made plain to <hi>the Lords,</hi> that this was spoken of some single and factious Lecturers, and that they had their Lectures Read by a Company of Learned and Orthodox Ministers by turns. As ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by the <hi>Munday</hi> Sermon at <hi>Burye,</hi> during that Learned Bishop's time. Nor were any forbid to Preach in the Afternoon, so the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techising were not omitted, before it, or with it. And the Bishop is Living to Answer it, if ought were then done amiss by him. In all which he did nothing, as any Deputy or Surrogate of mine, but as Diocesan of the Place. As for the Yearly Account to the <hi>King,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Royal <hi>Instructions</hi> in that behalf; though it were pressed here again to multiply noise, yet nothing being new, I gave my Answer as before, and to that I refer my self.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Third Answer was concerning Mr. <hi>Lee</hi> of <hi>Wolverhampton.</hi> The Evidence was a Letter of my Secretary Mr. <hi>Dell,</hi> written by my Command, to my Visitors there, to this Effect, <hi>That whether there were Cause or no, they should either punish Mr.</hi> Lee, <hi>or bring him into the</hi> High-Commission. Had the Words or the Sense been thus, they might well say, <hi>It was hard for the Judge before whom the Party was to Answer, to write thus.</hi> But I called to have the Letter read again, and the Words were these, <hi>If there were found against him that which might justly be Censured, then they should punish,</hi> &amp;c. And the Reason why this strict care was taken, was because the Dean of <hi>Windsor</hi> his Ordinary complained unto me, that Mr. <hi>Lee's</hi> Carriage was so Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous there, that he could contain him in no Order. If he <hi>were a Man after this approved at</hi> Shrewsbury (as Mr: <hi>Walker</hi> witnesses) I hope the Proceedings at <hi>Wolverhampton</hi> did him good. But, <hi>my Lords,</hi> had it so fallen out, that my Secretary had forgotten my Instructions, and himself too, and expressed himself amiss, shall that slip of his, (had it been such) be imputed to me? I believe <hi>your Lordships</hi> would not willingly answer for every Phrase of your Secretaries Letters, which yet you command them to write.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The last Instance, <hi>was the Sentence in the</hi> High-Commission <hi>against Mr:</hi> Barnard, <hi>for Words about</hi> Pelagian <hi>Errors and Popery.</hi> First, if he were Sentenced in the <hi>High-Commission,</hi> it was the Act of the Court, and not mine; as has been often said. Secondly, no Proof is offer'd that he was Sentenced for those Words only. Thirdly, the Recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation (howsoever refused by him, as Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> says it was) makes mention of four Points for which he was Censured, of which these words are one. But not the words themselves, but his Unjust and Scandalous Application of them to me, which deserved them not. And lastly, Dr: <hi>Cumber,</hi> Master of <hi>Trinity</hi> College in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> was Prosecutor against him; which Office, so Grave and Worthy a Man would not (I suppose) have undertaken, had there not been great and just Cause for it.</p>
                     <p>Hence they proceeded to the Sixth <hi>Additional Article,</hi> which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in these Words,</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>That whereas divers Gifts and Dispositions of divers Summs of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney were heretofore made by divers Charitable and well disposed Persons, for the buying in of divers <hi>Impropriations,</hi> for the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Preaching the Word of God in several Churches; the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:54614:198"/>
said Arch-Bishop about Eight Years last past, wilfully and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously caused the said Gifts, Feoffments, and Conveyances, made to the uses aforesaid, to be overthrown in his Majesty's Court of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,</hi> contrary to Law, as things dangerous to the Church and State, under the specious pretence of buying in <hi>Appropriations;</hi> whereby that Pious Work was suppressed and trodden down, to the great Dishonour of God, and Scandal of Religion.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>This Article is only about the <hi>Feoffments.</hi> That which I did was this. I was (as then advised upon such Information as was given me) clearly of Opinion, that this was a cunning way, under a Glorious pretence, to overthrow the Church-Government, by getting into their power more dependency of the Clergy, than <hi>the King,</hi> and all <hi>the Peers,</hi> and all <hi>the Bishops</hi> in all the Kingdom had. And I did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Plot the more dangerous for the fairness of the pretence; and that to the State, as well as the Church. Hereupon not malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously (as 'tis charged in the <hi>Article</hi>) but Conscientiously I resolved to suppress it, if by Law it might be done. Upon this, I acquainted <hi>his Majesty</hi> with the thing, and the danger which I conceived would in few Years spring out of it. The <hi>King</hi> referred me to his <hi>Attorney</hi> and the <hi>Law.</hi> Mr. Attorney <hi>Noye,</hi> after some pause upon it, proceeded in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and there it was by Judicial Proceeding and Sentence overthrown. If this Sentence were according to Law and Justice; then there's no fault at all committed: If it were against Law, the fault, what e're it be, was the Judges, not mine; for I soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited none of them. And here I humbly desired, that the <hi>Lords</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Leolin Jenkins</hi> hath a Copy of it out of the Records of the Exchequer. <hi>W. S. A. C.</hi>
                        </note> would at their leisure read over the Sentence given in the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, which I then delivered in; but by Reason of the length it was not then read: Whether after it were, I cannot tell. I desired like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that my <hi>Councel</hi> might be heard in this, and all other points of Law.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The First Witness was Mr. <hi>Kendall:</hi> He says, that speaking with me about <hi>Presteen, I thanked God that I had overthrown this</hi> Feoffment.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Second Witness Mr. <hi>Miller</hi> says, he heard me say, <hi>They would have undone the Church, but I have overthrown their</hi> Feoffment. These two Witnesses prove no more than I confess: For in the manner aforesaid, I deny not but I did my best in a Legal way to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it. And if I did Thank God for it, it was my Duty to do so, the thing being in my Judgment so pernicious as it was.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Third Witness was Mr. <hi>White,</hi> one of the <hi>Feoffees.</hi> He says, <hi>that coming as Councel in a Cause before me; when that Business was done, I fell bitterly on him as an underminer of the Church.</hi> I remember well his coming to me as Councel about a Benefice. And 'tis very likely I spake my Conscience to him, as freely as he did his to me; but the Particulars I remember not; nor do I remember his coming afterwards to me to <hi>Fulham;</hi> nor his offer <hi>to change the Men or the Course, so the thing might stand.</hi> For to this I should have been as willing as he was; and if I remember right, there was order ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for this in the Decree of the <hi>Exchequer.</hi> And <hi>his Majesty's</hi> Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:54614:198"/>
declared, that no Penny so given should be turned to other use. And I have been, and shall ever be as ready to get in Impropriations, by any Good and Legal way, as any Man (as may appear by my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours about the Impropriations in <hi>Ireland.</hi>) But this way did not stand either with my Judgment or Conscience.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. First, because little or nothing was given by them to the present Incumbent, to whom the Tythes were due, if to any; that the Parishioners which payed them, might have the more cheerful Instruction, the better Hospitality, and more full Relief for their Poor.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p n="2">2. Secondly, because most of the Men they put in, were Persons disaffected to the Discipline, if not the Doctrine too of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Thirdly, because no small part was given to School-Masters, to Season Youth <hi>ab Ovo,</hi> for their Party: And to Young Students in the Universities, to purchase them and their Judgments to their side, against their coming abroad into the Church.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Fourthly, because all this Power to breed and maintain a Faction, was in the Hands of Twelve Men, who were they never so Honest, and free from Thoughts of abusing this Power, to fill the Church with Schism, yet who should be Successors, and what use should be made of this Power, was out of Humane reach to know.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p n="5">5. Because this Power was assumed by, and to themselves, without any Legal Authority, as Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> assured me.</p>
                     <p>He farther said, <hi>that the Impropriation of</hi> Presteen <hi>in</hi> Radnorshire, <hi>was specially given to St:</hi> Antolins <hi>in</hi> London: I say the more the pity, considering the poorness of that Country, and the little Preaching that was among that poor People; and the plenty which is in <hi>London.</hi> Yet because it was so given, there was care taken after the <hi>Decree,</hi> that they of St: <hi>Antolins</hi> had consideration, and I think to the full. He says, <hi>that indeed they did not give any thing to the present Incumbents, till Good Men came to be in their Places.</hi> Scarce one Incumbent was better'd by them. And what then?
<q>
                           <p>In so many places not one <hi>Good Man</hi> found? Not one Factious enough against the Church, for  Mr: <hi>White</hi> to account him Good?</p>
                        </q>
Yet he thinks <hi>I disposed these things afterwards to Vnworthy Men.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>Truly, had they been at my disposal, I  should not wittingly have given them to Mr. <hi>White's</hi> Worthies.</p>
                        </q>
But <hi>his Majesty</hi> laid his Command upon his <hi>Attorney,</hi> and nothing was done or to be done in these things, but by his direction. For Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> if he spake any thing amiss concerning this Feoffment, in any Sermon of his, he is Living to Answer it; me it concerns not.
<q>
                           <p>Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> in the Summ of the Charge omitted not this. And I Answer'd as before. And in his Reply he turned again upon it, that it must be a Crime in me, because I projected to overthrow it. But, under favour, this follows not. For to project (though the word <hi>Projector</hi> sound ill in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) is no more than to forecast, and forelay any Business. Now as 'tis lawful for me, by all good and fit Means, to project the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of any thing that is good; so is it as lawful by good and Legal means, to project the overthrow of any thing that is cunningly or apparently Evil. And such did this Feoffment appear to my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:54614:199"/>
 and doth still.</p>
                        </q>
As for reducing of Impropriations to their proper use, they may see (if they please) in my <hi>Diary</hi> (whence they had this) another Project to buy them into the Churches use: For given they will not be. But Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> would shew nothing, nor Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> see any thing, but what they thought would make against me.</p>
                     <p>Here this day ended, and I was Commanded to Attend again, <hi>July</hi> 15. But was then put off to <hi>July</hi> 17. which day held. <note place="margin">

                     </q>
                     <p>The First Charge is, <hi>That I deny them to be a Church: For they say, that I</hi>

                        <hi>witnessed was found in my Study, and Licensed by Dr.</hi> Braye: Is this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument come again, that Bishop <hi>Mountague's</hi> Book was in my Study?

                        </q>
But they have now left me never a Book in my Study; so I cannot make them any fuller Answer, without view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the place, than themselves help me to by their own Confession. Which is, that he adds this Exception, that none but a Bishop can Ordain, but <hi>in Casu Necessitatis,</hi> which is the Opinion of many Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Moderate Divines.
<q>
                           <p>Yet this is very considerable in the Business, whether an inevitable Necessity be cast upon them, or  they pluck a kind of Necessity upon themselves.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Second Charge is out of a Letter of mine to Bishop <hi>Hall,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">II.</note> upon a Letter which he had formerly sent me. In which it seems, <hi>is something about the Case of Necessity in point of Ordination, which</hi> (<hi>they say</hi>) <hi>I disliked.</hi> And it seems I disliked upon good ground. For
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:54614:199"/>
he had given me power under his Hand, to alter what I would in that which he sent unto me. I would not take that power, but writ back to him what passages I thought might be better expressed, if it could agree with his Judgment also. Hereupon he sent me another Letter of <hi>Jan.</hi> 18. 1639. In which he altered those things which I put to his farther Consideration. Could any thing be more fairly carried? And this Letter was read to the Lords. Yea, but they say, <hi>I disliked the giving of this Title</hi> Antichrist <hi>to the Pope.</hi> No, I did not simply dislike it, but I advised Bishop <hi>Hall,</hi> if he thought it good, not to affirm it so positively. And the Reason I gave was this. That King <hi>James</hi> being pressed upon a great occasion, that he had main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <hi>that the Pope was Antichrist,</hi> which might much trouble, if not quite cross some Proceedings much desired by that Prudent King: <hi>His Majesty</hi> made Answer: <hi>I maintain it not as a point of Faith, but as a probable Opinion: And for which I have more grounds than the</hi> Pope <hi>hath for his Challenge of Temporal Power over Princes. Let him recall this Opinion, and I'll recall that.</hi> This I writ to the Bishop, but left him free to do what he pleased.</p>
                     <p>Here Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> fell extream foul upon me, in so much, that I could not but wonder at their patience which heard him. Among other Titles bestowed upon me, many and gross, he called me over and over again, <hi>Pander to the Whore of Babylon.</hi> I was much moved; and humbly desired <hi>the Lords,</hi> that if my Crimes were such, as that I might not be used like an <hi>Arch-Bishop,</hi> yet I might be used like a <hi>Christian:</hi> And that were it not for the Duty which I owe to God and my own Innocency, I would desert my Defence, before I would indure such Language in such an Honourable Presence. Hereupon some <hi>Lords</hi> shewed their dislike, and wished him to leave, and pursue the Evidence.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> in summing up the Charge made this a great matter, <hi>The denial of the</hi> Pope <hi>to be</hi> Antichrist. But I did not deny it, nor declare any Opinion of my own: And many <hi>Protestants,</hi> and those very Learned, are of Opinion that he is not. 'Tis true I did not, I cannot approve foul Language in Controversies.

                     </q>
                     <p>The Third Charge was out of a Paper, which Bishop <hi>Hall,</hi> about <note place="margin">III.</note> the time when he wrote his Book in defence of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> sent unto me, containing divers Propositions concerning Episcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: In which, either he or I, or both say, (for that Circumstance
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:54614:200"/>
I remember not) <hi>That Church-Government by Bishops is not alterable by Humane Law.</hi> To this I answer'd, that Bishops might be regulated and limited by Human Laws, in those things which are but Incidents to their Calling. But their Calling, so far as it is <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> by Divine Right, cannot be taken away. They charge farther, <hi>that I say this is the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England. And so I think it is. For Bishop <hi>Bilson</hi> set out a Book in the <hi>Queen's</hi> time, Intituled, <hi>The Perpetual</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Bishop <hi>Bilson's</hi> Perpetual Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> 
                        <hi>Government.</hi> And if the Government by Bishops be <hi>Perpetual,</hi> as he there very Learnedly proves thorough the whole Book, it will be hard for any <hi>Christian</hi> Nation to out it. Nor is this his Judgment alone, but of the whole Church of <hi>England.</hi> For in the <hi>Preface</hi> to the <note place="margin">Book of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Preface.</note> 
                        <hi>Book of Ordination,</hi> are these words. <hi>From the Apostles time, there have been three Orders of Ministers in the Church of</hi> Christ, <hi>Bishops, Priests and Deacons.</hi> Where 'tis evident, that in the Judgment of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Episcopacy is a different, not <hi>Degree</hi> only, but <hi>Order,</hi> from Priesthood, and so hath been reputed from the <hi>Apostles</hi> times. And this was then Read to <hi>the Lords.</hi> And the Law of <hi>England</hi> is as full for it, as the Church. For the Statute in <hi>the eighth of the Queen,</hi> abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely <note place="margin">8 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1.</note> confirms all and every part of this <hi>Book of Ordination.</hi> Where also the Law calls it, <hi>The high Estate of Prelacy.</hi> And <hi>Calvin</hi> (if my <note place="margin">
                           <hi>S. John</hi> 20. 21. <hi>Calvin</hi> Ibid.</note> old Memory do not fail me) upon those words <hi>of St.</hi> John, <hi>As my Father sent me, so send I you,</hi> &amp;c. says thus upon that place, <hi>Eandem illis imponit Personam ac idem Juris assignat.</hi> And if our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>Christ,</hi> put the same Person upon the Apostles, and assigned to them the same Right, which his Father gave him; it will prove a sour work to throw their Successors the Bishops out of the Church after Sixteen Hundred Years continuance.
<q>
                           <p>And in the mean time  cry out against Innovation.</p>
                        </q>
For either <hi>Christ</hi> gave this Power to his <hi>Apostles</hi> only; and that will make the Gospel a Thing Temporary, and confined to <hi>the Apostles</hi> Times: Or else he gave the same Power, though not with such Eminent Gifts, to their Successors also, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate the same Gospel to the end of the World, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us he did, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.

                     <p>The Fourth Charge was an Alteration made in a <hi>Brief,</hi> for a third <note place="margin">IV.</note> Collection for the distressed Ministers and others in the <hi>Palatinat.</hi> The Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> was pleased to do me the Honour to write to me about this; and because two Collections had been before, <hi>her Majesty</hi> desired, that this third might be only in <hi>London,</hi> and some few Shires about it. I out of my desire to relieve those distressed <hi>Protestants,</hi> and to express my Duty to the <hi>Queen,</hi> became an humble Suitor to <hi>his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi> that this Collection also might go thorough <hi>England,</hi> as the rest had done. And 'tis acknowledged by all, that this I did. Now the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which Accuse me for some Circumstances in this business, are two.</p>

Secondly, what kindness I shewed him and the Business, is mentioned before; and if for this kindness he had been practising with Mr. <hi>Wakerly</hi> about the <hi>Brief</hi> (as I had probable Reason to suspect) I cannot much be blamed, if I altered my Countenance towards him, and my Speech too; which yet these Witnesses (for the other agrees in this) have no Reason to call rough Carriage, only upon Mr. <hi>Ruly's</hi> unthankful Report.</p>
                     <p>He says, <hi>That these words,</hi> the Antichristian Yoak, were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> out. First, this is more than I remember; and the <hi>Briefs</hi> I had not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare; nor is there any necessity, that two <hi>Briefs</hi> coming for the same thing, with some Years distance between, should agree in every Phrase or Circumstance. Secondly, if I did except against this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, it was partly because of the fore-recited Judgment of King <hi>James,</hi> of which I thought his Son King <hi>Charles</hi> ought to be tender: And partly, because it could move nothing but Scorn in the common Adversary, that we should offer to determine such a Controversie by a <hi>Broad Seal.</hi> I remember well, since I had the Honour to sit in this House, the naming of Tithes to be due <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> cast out the Bill; A Prudent Lord asking the Peers, whether they meant to determine that question by <hi>an Act of Parliament?</hi> The other part of the Clause which they say was altered, was <hi>the Religion which we with them profess:</hi> Whence they infer, because <hi>(with them)</hi> was left out, that I would not acknowledge them of the same Religion; which follows not. For we may be, and are of the same Religion; and yet <hi>(agree)</hi> not with them in those Opinions, in which we differ from them. And Mr. <hi>Wakerly</hi> confesses, that the Words as alter'd, are, <hi>That they are Persecuted for their Religion;</hi> and their Religion is the <hi>Protestant</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and so is ours. And therefore I could have no intention to make the Religions different, but the Opinions under the same Religion.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>For Mr: <hi>Wakerly,</hi> he is a <hi>Dutchman</hi> born; and how far the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of an Alien may be of force by the Law, I know not: And a bitter Enemy to me he hath ever shewed himself, since I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to <hi>the King</hi> and <hi>the Lords,</hi> that a Stranger born and bred, should be so near a Secretary of State, and all his Papers and Cyphers, as he was known to be to Mr. <hi>Secretary Coke:</hi> A thing which few States would indure: And how far the Testimony of such a Canker'd Enemy should be admitted, let the World judge.  Admitted he was.</p>

He says, <hi>there was no Alteration but in that Clause, and that implies a manifest difference.</hi> But that is but in his Judgment, in which I have already shewed that <hi>Wakerly</hi> is mistaken, and so is he. Beside, he comes here as a Witness of the Fact, not as a Judge of my Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Thoughts. He adds, <hi>That, if he remember well, the Alteration was drawn by me.</hi> But, if he do not remember well, what then? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here's no Evidence to be grounded upon <hi>Ifs.</hi> Here upon the point of Antichrist, Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> stiled me as before, and was furious till he foamed again; but I saw a necessity of Patience.

also in his Summary Ch followed this Business close. But I  gave it the same Answer.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Fifth Charge, and the last under this Article, was the calling <note place="margin">V.</note> in of a Book, <hi>An.</hi> 1637. shewing the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church in the <hi>Palatinat; but called in only because against</hi> Arminianism. The single Witness <hi>Michael Sparks.</hi> He says, <hi>this Book was called in,</hi> but he knows not by whom, nor mentions he for what. But he says, <hi>The Pursevants which searched for it, were mine.</hi> He means such as belonged to the <hi>High-Commission;</hi> for other than such I had none. And there was cause enough for calling in the Book, without think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Arminianism.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>But what is the Reason, why here's nothing urged against me, about Abrogating the Immunities and Priviledges of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches, which fill the Body of this <hi>Article?</hi> Why, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there may be two Reasons of it. One, because there was taken by Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> among other Papers for my Defence, a Letter <note place="margin">See the <hi>Letter</hi> above, in the <hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note> under Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> own Hand, to the Lord <hi>Pawlet</hi> Marquess of <hi>Winchester,</hi> then Lord <hi>Treasurer,</hi> in which she expresses her wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness, that those Strangers, distressed in and for point of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, should have Succour and free Entertainment; but should conform themselves to the <hi>English</hi> Liturgy, and have that Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated into their own Language. And they knew, I would call to have this Letter produced, proved, and read. And had this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter been stood unto, they had never been able to do the Church of <hi>England</hi> half the harm they have since done. The other was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they found by their own search against me, that all which I did concerning those Churches, was with this Moderation, that all those of their several Congregations, in <hi>London, Canterbury, Sandwich, Norwich,</hi> or elsewhere, which were of the second Descent, and born in <hi>England,</hi> should repair to their several Parish Churches, and Conform themselves to the Doctrine, Discipline, and Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and not live continually in an open Separation, as if they were an <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>AEgypt,</hi> to the great distraction of the Natives of this Kingdom, and the assisting of that Schism which is now broke forth. And as this was with great Moderation, so was it with the joint Approbation of <hi>his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi> and the <hi>Lords of his Council,</hi> upon the Reasons openly given and debated: And all this before I proceeded to do any thing. As  appears <hi>apud Acta.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then they went to the Thirteenth <hi>Original Article;</hi> which here follows.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>He hath Trayterously and Wickedly endeavoured to reconcile the Church of <hi>England</hi> with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting thereof, hath Consorted and Confederated with divers <hi>Popish</hi> Priests and <hi>Jesuits,</hi> and hath kept secret Intelligence with the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by himself, his Agents or Instruments, Treated with such as have from thence received Authority and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction: He hath permitted and countenanced a <hi>Popish</hi> Hierarchy, or Ecclesiastical Government, to be Established in this Kingdom. By all which Trayterous and Malicious Practices, this Church and
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:54614:201"/>
Kingdom have been exceedingly indangered, and like to fall under the Tyranny of the <hi>Roman</hi> See.</p>
                        <p>The Seventh <hi>Additional Article.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That the said Arch-Bishop at several times within these Ten Years last past, at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and elsewhere within this Realm, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the known Laws of this Land, hath endeavoured to advance <hi>Popery</hi> and Superstition within the Realm. And for that End and Purpose hath wittingly and willingly received, harboured and relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved divers <hi>Popish</hi> Priests and Jesuits, namely one called <hi>Sancta Clara,</hi> alias <hi>Damport,</hi> a dangerous Person, and <hi>Franciscan</hi> Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, who having written a <hi>Popish</hi> and Seditious Book Intituled <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Natura, Gratia,</hi> wherein the Thirty nine Articles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> established by Act of Parliament, were much Traduced and Scandalized; the said Arch-Bishop had divers Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences with him, while he was in writing the said Book, and did also provide Maintenance and Entertainment for one <hi>Monsieur S. Giles,</hi> a <hi>Popish</hi> Priest, at <hi>Oxford;</hi> knowing him to be a <hi>Popish</hi> Priest.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>The First Charge (they say) was to be laid as a Foundation, and it <note place="margin">I.</note> was, <hi>That I was generally reputed a</hi> Papist <hi>in Heart, both in</hi> Oxford, <hi>and since I came thence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. The first Witness for this was Dr. <hi>Featly.</hi> He says, <hi>There was such an Opinion of me Thirty Years since there.</hi> But he says, he never heard any <hi>Popish</hi> Opinion maintained by me. So here's nothing of Knowledge: And if I should say, that above Thirty Years ago, there was an Opinion, that Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> then in <hi>Oxford,</hi> was a <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan;</hi> this could make no Proof against him; nor can his saying that I was reputed a <hi>Papist,</hi> make any Proof against me. He says far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>That one Mr.</hi> Russel, <hi>who had been bred in S.</hi> John's College, <hi>told him, in</hi> Paris, <hi>That I maintained some Catholick Opinions.</hi> First, Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> would have it, <hi>that this Mr.</hi> Russel <hi>was my Scholar:</hi> But that the whole College can witness it is not so; nor had he ever any relation to me, in the least Degree. After his Father's Death, he left the College, and went beyond Sea; where the Weak Man, (for such he was) lost his Religion. Secondly, Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> says ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, that Mr. <hi>Russel</hi> said, <hi>I was no Papist;</hi> which, for the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his own Change, he would never have said, had he thought me one. Thirdly, if he did say that I maintained some Catholick Opinions; yet he named none, by which there might be Tryal and Judgment, whether they were such or no, in the Sense he meant them. Lastly, Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> in his <hi>Reformed Catholick,</hi> sets down divers Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in which they of <hi>Rome</hi> and we agree: Shall he be a <hi>Papist</hi> for this? Or shall not that which is Lawful for him, be as Lawful for me?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Second Witness was one <hi>Harris.</hi> He says, <hi>that Mr.</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, (who was some time Student of <hi>Christ-Church</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and after School-Master at <hi>Westminster</hi>) <hi>told him that I would leave the Church of</hi> England. This is a bare Report from Mr. <hi>Ireland,</hi> with whom I never had any Acquaintance, nor was scarce in his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny twice in all my Life. Nor is it in my Power to hinder what Mr.
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:54614:202" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>Ireland</hi> will say, or Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> from him. He says, <hi>That one that called himself</hi> Leander, <hi>came over on purpose to make this Reconciliation.</hi> If he did (which is more than I know, or believe) I think he would hardly make such a one, as <hi>Harris</hi> is reported to be, acquainted with it. But howsoever, if he did come with that purpose, was it in my Power to hinder his coming? And here is no Proof offered that I did help on his Purpose, or so much as know of it. He says, <hi>he often Petitioned me for Relief, but had none.</hi> It may be, I well knew he deserved none: And <hi>your Lordships</hi> know that by Law I might not afford him any. Had I given him any, I should now have heard it with both Ears. For I am informed he is a Priest, and Condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> and was let out of Prison, on purpose to be a Witness against me. And having set that which is aforesaid, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Hand, is now slipped away, and gone. Who got him out of Prison for this good purpose, I know not; but fure somewhat there is in it, for <hi>your Lordships</hi> see his Testimony is now read, but he appears not.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Third Witness was Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent</hi> (now absent, but came in the next Day) He says, <hi>I was esteemed Popishly Affected in</hi> Oxford; and he gave Three Instances very carefully, to prove it. The First was, <hi>That in the</hi> Divinity School <hi>there, I maintained the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Baptism.</hi> I did so; and my Predecessor Arch-Bishop <hi>Abbot</hi> was then Vice-Chancellor, and present, and approved my Opinion; and my Grace passed for my Degree to be <hi>Batchellour of Divinity</hi> without any one Man's Opposition. He says, <hi>That Mr.</hi> Dale <hi>of</hi> Merton <hi>College, then shewed him all my Supposition taken out of</hi> Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min. This is a bold and a dangerous Oath: He might Swear that Mr. <hi>Dale</hi> shewed him in <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> that which he said was my Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position: But that he shewed him all my Supposition there, is a strange Oath for a Man of Learning and Law to make, and in such a Presence. Besides, I have my <hi>Supposition,</hi> which I then made, yet by me; and if my <hi>Tenet</hi> of that Question be the same with <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min's,</hi> or that there be any Line taken out of him, but what I cite for my own advantage against him, I will utterly forfeit my Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of any Learning to <hi>your Lordships.</hi> His Second Instance was, <hi>That I was acquainted with one Mr:</hi> Brown, <hi>Fellow of</hi> Corpus Christi <hi>College in</hi> Oxford, <hi>who was suspected to be a</hi> Papist, <hi>and after his Death proved to be one by a Book that was found in his Study, proving that a Man might be a</hi> Roman-Catholick, <hi>and yet go to Church and Conform in</hi> England. I was acquainted with this Man; he was a very good Scholar and an Honest man, and a good <hi>Protestant,</hi> for ought I know. For the <hi>Tract</hi> found after his Death among his Papers, that's no Proof: For Scholars get all the Papers they can, especially such as belong to their own Profession. And the more strange the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are, the more do they labour to get them. Nor is it any Proof <hi>that the</hi> Tract <hi>was of his making, because written in his own Hand, as 'tis urged.</hi> For the Argument being so foul and dangerous, it could not be safe for him, nor any way fit, to commit it to any other to write for him. Nor is there any Proof that I knew he had such a <hi>Tract</hi> by him; neither indeed did I. The Opinion is very base and unworthy, and was first broached by the Jesuit <hi>Azorius,</hi>

and it seems some of his Fellows had inlarged him, and made this <hi>Tract</hi> out of his Principles. His Third Instance was, <hi>That I Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned King</hi> James <hi>in this Business.</hi> I was complained of to King <hi>James</hi> by a great Person, That I had inward Acquaintance with this Man. Hereupon, my waiting Month being <hi>June,</hi> and not long after the Complaint made, I took Occasion in my first Sermon to confute this Opinion, and then Petitioned <hi>his Majesty</hi> that it might be examined, that such an Imputation might not lie upon me. <hi>His Majesty</hi> referred it to the Lords Arch-Bishop of <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Bishops of <hi>London, Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> and <hi>Duresm;</hi> where after full examination I was Acquitted.</p>
                     <p>The Second Charge was, that the same Opinion was held of <note place="margin">II.</note> me beyond the Seas, <hi>That I was a cunning Promoter of the</hi> Roman <hi>Cause.</hi> And here the Witnesses are the same, which were produced before; Mr. <hi>Challoner,</hi> who told over his old Tale again of I know not what Plot he heard from a <hi>Jesuit:</hi> Nothing but Hearsay at the best. And it savours like an Almanack <hi>de Post Facto,</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>or rather of  somwhat else, which I will spare to name, because he is upon his Oath.</p>
                        </q>
The other Witness is Mr. <hi>Anthony Mildmay,</hi> who also tells over his Old Tale of his <hi>Father Fitton.</hi> But he was out of the way again, and appeared not till the next Day, with Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent.</hi> So here's a Repetition again of the same Witnesses, and the same things, to multiply the Noise.
<q>
                           <p>Only Noble Sir <hi>Henry Mildmay</hi> appeared not the Second time; but whether it were because he had enough at his first appearance; or whether his Face was scratched then (as  since Men say it was) I cannot tell.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Third Charge was, <hi>That I had a damnable Plot, to reconcile the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">III.</note> 
                        <hi>Church of</hi> England <hi>with the Church of</hi> Rome. If to reconcile them with the maintenance of Idolatry, it were a damnable Plot indeed. But if <hi>Christian</hi> Truth and Peace might meet and unite together, all <hi>Christendom over;</hi> were that a Sin too? Were I able to Plot and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect such a Reconciliation, I would think my self most Happy, whatever I suffered for it. But how is this damnable Plot proved? <hi>Pope</hi> Gregory <hi>writ a Letter to his</hi> Nuncio <hi>in</hi> Spain, <hi>and a Letter also to King</hi> Charles; <hi>which Letter is Printed: Copies of these Letters were found in my Study.</hi> Could I hinder the <hi>Pope</hi> from writing to whom he pleased? Shall not I get Copies of any Letters I can, to see what practising is abroad for private Interest? Shall it be Lawful for all my Predecessors to get and keep Copies of such Letters by them, and shall it be Unlawful for me only? And here I produced Mr. <hi>Dobson,</hi> an ancient Servant to my Predecessors, who witnessed that Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Bancroft</hi> had store of them, and kept them all his Time. Nor do I know, how this Charge can fall upon me: For there is no one Word in any of the Letters produced, that Reflects upon me, or any Plot of mine. Nor indeed had I ever any such to Reflect upon.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth Charge is, <hi>That I had a Hand in the Plot for sending</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">IV.</note> 
                        <hi>the King, when he was Prince, into</hi> Spain, <hi>to be perverted in his Religion.</hi> They follow their Proof of this out of my <hi>Diary:</hi> And they begin with my Friendship with the Lord Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Prince in this Journey. And first they urged my <hi>Diary</hi> at <hi>June</hi> 9. 1622. where I mention, that <hi>there were then Particulars, which</hi>
                        <pb n="382" facs="tcp:54614:203" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>are not for Paper.</hi> But the Words, which lead these in, were his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance upon a near Respect to me, the particular Expressions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>were not for Paper:</hi> Nor Word, nor Thought, of either Plot or <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</hi> Then they urged <hi>June</hi> 15. 1622. where 'tis said, that I <hi>became C.</hi> that is, <hi>Confessor to the Lord Duke.</hi> First, if my <hi>Lord Duke</hi> would Honour me so much as to make me his <hi>Confessor,</hi> as I know no Sin in it, so is it abundantly Proof, that the Passages before mentioned were not for Paper. Should I venture them so, there's never a Person of Honour present, but would think me most unworthy of that Trust. Next, they pressed <hi>June</hi> 13. 1623. where I confess, that <hi>I received Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from my Lord Duke out of</hi> Spain. I did so; and I then held it great Honour to me, and do so still. But then, and long before, it was known to all Men whither he was gone, and with whom: Nay, it was commonly known to all Men of Quality hereabout within three or four Days: And till it was so commonly known, I knew it not. Yea, but then they inforced <hi>out of Feb.</hi> 17. 1622/3. That the <hi>Prince and the Marquess of</hi> Buckingham <hi>set forward very Secretly for</hi> Spain. And <hi>Feb.</hi> 21. that <hi>I writ to his Lordship into</hi> Spain. 'Tis true, they went away that Day, and very secretly; but I neither did, nor could set it down, till afterwards that I came to know it. And then so soon as I came to know it, which was about the 21th. I did write. To these was Cunningly (how Honestly let all the World Judge) pieced <hi>a Passage</hi> out of <hi>a Letter</hi> of mine to Bishop <hi>Hall.</hi> But that Letter was read, at my humble motion to the <hi>Lords,</hi> and the Date of it was in 1634. So, many Years after this Business of <hi>Spain.</hi> And the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage mentioned, was only about King <hi>James</hi> his manner of defending the Pope to be <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and how he salved it while the Prince was in <hi>Spain.</hi> But King <hi>James</hi> related it after. Nor could any Words of that Letter be drawn to <hi>the King's</hi> going thither, much less to any knowledge I had of it.</p>
                     <p>The Fifth Charge was <hi>concerning</hi> his Majesty's <hi>Match with</hi> France. <note place="margin">V.</note> And here again they urge my <hi>Diary</hi> at <hi>Mar.</hi> 11. 1625. That <hi>the Duke of</hi> Buckingham <hi>was then and there employed.</hi> And at <hi>May</hi> 19. <hi>and</hi> 29. that <hi>I then writ Letters to him.</hi> First, <hi>my Lords,</hi> I hold it my great Honour, that <hi>my Lord Duke</hi> would write to me, and give me leave to write to him. Secondly, I have committed some Error in these Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or none. If none, why are they Charged? If any, why are they not produced, that I may see what it is, and answer it?</p>
                     <p>The Sixth Charge was, <hi>That I was an Instrument of the Queens.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">VI.</note> This they endeavoured to prove by <hi>my Diary</hi> in Three Places. First, <hi>at Aug.</hi> 30. 1634. <hi>Vpon occasion of some Service done, she was graciously pleased to give me leave to have immediate Access unto her, when I had Occasion.</hi> This is true, and I most humbly Thanked <hi>her Majesty</hi> for it: For I very well knew what belonged to Addresses at Second Hand in Court. But what Crime is in this, that <hi>the Queen</hi> was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to give me Access unto her, when I had Occasion? Here's no Word of Religion. Secondly, at <hi>May</hi> 18. 1635. Where 'tis said, that <hi>I gave her Majesty an account of some thing committed to me.</hi> If <hi>her Majesty</hi> sent or spake to me to do any thing, as it seems she did, shall I want so much Duty as to give her an Account of it? So belike I must be unmannerly with <hi>her Majesty,</hi> or lye open to no less than a
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:54614:203"/>
Charge of high Treason. Thirdly, at <hi>April</hi> 3. 1639. 'Tis made a great matter, <hi>that I should then dispatch a great business for the</hi> Queen, <hi>which I understood she would not move for her self:</hi> And that <hi>for this her Majesty gave me great Thanks.</hi> Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> his Inference upon this, was, <hi>that they conceive wherefore.</hi> But his Conceit makes no Evidence: He must not only conceive, but prove wherefore, before it can work any thing against me. As for Religion, as there is no Word of it in my <hi>Diary,</hi> so neither was it at this time thought on. <hi>Her Majesty</hi> would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in have moved for her self. But it seems it must be a Crime if I be but Civil and Dutiful towards <hi>the Queen,</hi> though it be but thrice mentioned in so many Years.</p>
                     <p>The Seventh Charge was, that <hi>I forbad Ministers Praying for the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">VII.</note> 
                        <hi>Queens Conversion, and punished others.</hi> The First Witness, Mr. <hi>Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliff,</hi> says, <hi>that Sir</hi> Nath. Brent <hi>gave it in Charge at</hi> Bow <hi>Church in my Visitation.</hi> The more to blame he, if so he did. Yea, but he says <hi>it was by my Command delivered unto him by Sir</hi> John Lambe. Was it so? How doth Mr. <hi>Ratcliff</hi> know that? He doth not express. He was not present, when I spake with Sir <hi>John Lambe.</hi> And if Sir <hi>Nath. Brent</hi> told him of it, 'tis but Hearsay. And Sir <hi>Nath.</hi> having been so ready a Witness against me, why is he not examined to this Particular? And as for the Paper which was shewed, it appears plainly there, that it was no Paper of <hi>Instructions</hi> sent to my Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors by me, but of particular Informations to me: Of which one was, <hi>that the Queen was prayed for in a very Factious and Scandalous Way.</hi> And this appeared, when that <hi>Paper</hi> was read. And this I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to my Visitors, as I not only might, but ought: Not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Prayers, but the Scandalous manner of them. The Second Witness was Mr. <hi>Pryn.</hi> Who says, <hi>That one Mr.</hi> Jones <hi>was punished for praying for the Queen.</hi> He was punished in the <hi>High-Commission</hi> for scandalous Abusing <hi>the Queen,</hi> under a Form of Praying for her, and for divers other Articles that were against him.
<q>
                           <p>And this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer I gave to Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> who forgot not this in summing up  my Charge.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Eighth Charge was, <hi>That I punished Men for Praying to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">VIII.</note> 
                        <hi>the Prince.</hi> No, God forbid. The <hi>High-Commission Book</hi> was shewed, and that there in the Year 1634. one Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> was Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured for it. I got this Act of the <hi>High-Commission</hi> to be read to <hi>the Lords:</hi> His Prayer went thus, <hi>That God would preserve the Prince in the true Religion, of which there was cause to fear.</hi> Could this Prayer have any other Operation upon the People, than to make them think <hi>his Majesty</hi> was careless in the Education of <hi>the Prince,</hi> especially in point of Religion? And this was so Grievous and Graceless a Scandal cast upon a Religious King, as nothing could be greater. Upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it was the shew of a Prayer for <hi>the Prince,</hi> but was indeed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy <hi>the King</hi> in the Hearts of his People. And had I not there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to his Punishment, I had deserved to be punished my self.
<q>
                           <p>Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> when he repeated the Summ of the Evidence, laid this Charge upon me, but spake not one Word (to my Remembrance)  of this Answer given to it.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Ninth Charge, <hi>That I did Extol Queen</hi> Mary's <hi>Days.</hi> The Proof <note place="margin">IX.</note> for it was taken out <hi>of the Preface to the</hi> Statutes <hi>of the Vniversity of</hi>
                        <pb n="384" facs="tcp:54614:204" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Oxford. I took a great deal of pains about those Statutes, and might justly have expected <hi>Thanks</hi> for it, not such an <hi>Accusation.</hi> But as for <hi>the Preface,</hi> it was made and Printed at <hi>Oxford:</hi> I medled not with it. I could trust the University with little, if not with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a Preface. If they have done any thing amiss in it, let them answer it. The Passage was about certain Offers made to amend those Confused Old Statutes, both in <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. and Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> Days; but no Effect came of the pains then taken, <hi>Recruduit Labor,</hi> says <hi>the Preface.</hi> So that this I can answer for them: There's not a Word spoken of Religion, but of Manners only, and that as much in relation to the Times of Princes following, as Hers. For the Words, to my remembrance, are <hi>Interim optandâ Temporum Foelicitate,</hi> &amp;c. And that <hi>Interim</hi> cannot be restrained to Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> Days only, but must include the whole <hi>Interim,</hi> or middle distance of Time to that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in which I setled the Body of their Statutes, that is, all Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> his Days; which I think no Man can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was, <hi>Optanda Temporum Foelicitas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> confessed there was <hi>no down-right Proof</hi> against <note place="margin">X.</note> me. That was his Phrase: But he added, that was not to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in such a Work of Darkness. Then he <hi>produced a Paper found in my Study, Printed at</hi> Rome. So were divers of my Books Printed there: What of this? They may Print what they will at <hi>Rome,</hi> I cannot hinder it: And I may have and keep whatever they Print, no Law forbidding it. Then <hi>he shewed a Letter sent unto me from Mr.</hi> Graves. The Gentleman is at this present Fellow of <hi>Merton College</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> a great Traveller, and a Man of great Worth. As far as I remember, his Letter came to me from <hi>Alexandria.</hi> It was fit to be sent, and kindly received; as by me it was. I desired it might be read. Then were mentioned <hi>Sir</hi> William Boswell's <hi>Letters, and the Papers sent by</hi> Andreas ab Habernfeld, <hi>about a great Plot to destroy the King and Religion, and that I concealed these Papers.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>I might have been amazed at the Impudence of this Charge above all the rest. <hi>Diaboli Impudentia,</hi> the Devils Impudence, and no less, as  S. <hi>Augustin</hi> speaks in another Case.</p>
                        </q>
Did I conceal these Papers? <note place="margin">S. Aug. Epist. <hi>167.</hi>
                        </note> First, the same Day that I received them, I sent them by an Express to <hi>his Majesty.</hi> I had a speedy Answer from <hi>his Majesty,</hi> and that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with equal speed to <hi>his Majesty's</hi> Agent Sir <hi>William Boswell,</hi> as I was commanded. <note place="margin">This Book was Published by <hi>Pryn</hi> in the Year <hi>1643.</hi> in <hi>5.</hi> Sheets in Quarto. A Copy whereof being by his Endeavours conveyed to the Arch-Bishop, then a Prisoner in <hi>the Tower,</hi> the Arch-Bishop wrote Notes in the Margin of it, so far, and so much, as to vindicate himself from the Aspersions laid upon him therein. This Copy with the said Notes is now in the Hands of that knowing and learned Antiquary Mr. <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Wood;</hi> which having been by him Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to me, I have, with his Leave, Transcribed the Arch-Bishops Notes, and caused them to be adjoined to these Papers concerning the Plot discovered by <hi>Andrew ab Habernfeld,</hi> reprinted in the following Collection. <hi>H:</hi>
                        </note> And this Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> knew. For Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> took all these Letters and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers from me, when he searched me at <hi>the Tower;</hi> and out of them made his Book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Rome's Masterpiece:</hi> Excepting the Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which he hath Jugled in of his own. So soon as <hi>his Majesty</hi> came home, I humbly besought him, that he would be pleased to appoint a time, and call some Lords to him to hear and examine the Business, and this Examination continued till I was Committed. What was after done, I cannot account for. Besides, <hi>my Lords,</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by those Paprs, that my Life was sought for, because I would
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:54614:204"/>
not give way to the Change of Religion; and Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> himself hath Printed this; and yet now Mr. <hi>Nicolas,</hi> from his Testimony, presses these Papers against me. But <hi>the King,</hi> and <hi>the Lords,</hi> and both Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries of State then present, can witness, that I took all the Care and Pains above-mentioned, to have it sifted to the Bottom.
<q>
                           <p>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all this, Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> falls upon this Plot again upon the next Day of my Hearing, as if nothing had been said unto it: And was so shameless, as to say, <hi>that I followed this Business so long as I thought the Plot was against the</hi> Puritans: <hi>But so soon as I found it was against the</hi> Papists, <hi>I kept it secret, till Mr.</hi> Pryn <hi>discovered it in his search of my Papers.</hi> Where, First, there's no one Word in all the Papers to make me, or any Man think the Puritans were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it. And Secondly, I did not sleep upon the Receipt of these Papers, till I had sent them to <hi>his Majesty.</hi> But I had reason to keep the Papers as safe as I could, considering how much they  justifie me against these foul Calumnies put upon me.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then followed the Charge of <hi>Sancta Clara's</hi> Book, <hi>alias Monsieur St:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">XI.</note> 
                        <hi>Giles:</hi> So they expressed it; and I must follow the way they lead me. First then, they Charge <hi>that I had often Conference with him,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                        <hi>while he was writing his Book Intituled</hi> Deus, Natura, Gratia. No, he never came to me, till he was ready to Print that Book. Then some Friends of his brought him to me. His Suit then was, That he might Print that Book here. Upon Speech with him, I found the Scope of his Book to be such, as that <hi>the Church of England</hi> would have little Cause to thank him for it: And so absolutely deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. Nor did he ever come more at me after this, but twice or thrice at most, when he made great Friends to me, that he might Print another Book, to prove that Bishops are by Divine Right. My Answer then was, that I did not like the way which <hi>the Church of Rome</hi> went, in the Case of Episcopacy. And howsoever, that I would never give way, that any such Book should be Printed here from the Pen of a <hi>Romanist;</hi> and that the Bishops of <hi>England</hi> were able to defend their own Cause and Calling, without calling in Aid from <hi>Rome;</hi> and would in due time. Maintenance he never had any from me, nor did I then know him to be a Priest. Nor was there any Proof so much as offered in contrary to any of this.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, they did specially except <hi>against a Passage in the Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, and another at the end of the Book.</hi> The Book was Printed at <hi>Lions,</hi> where I could not hinder the Printing, either of the whole, or any part. This might have been something, had I Licensed it here: But that I constantly denyed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thirdly, They produced a Letter written to me from <hi>Venice,</hi> by one Mr: <hi>Middleton,</hi> Chaplain there to the Right Honourable the now <hi>Earl of Denbigh,</hi> his Majesty's Ambassadour. Therein he writes, <hi>That</hi> S: Clara <hi>was</hi> Homo nequissimus, <hi>and that one Monsieur</hi> S: Giles <hi>was the Author of that Book.</hi> That <hi>Clara</hi> and <hi>S: Giles</hi> were the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, is but Mr: <hi>Middleton's</hi> Opinion. Such News as he there heard, some true, some false, he thought fit to write unto me: And he being absent, here's no Proof upon Oath, that they are one and the same Person. And I hope a young Man's Letter from <hi>Venice,</hi> or any other place, signifying only such things as he hears, shall not stand for good
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:54614:205"/>
Evidence in a Case of Life. And he was mainly deceived in this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, as appears: First, Because what <hi>Clara</hi> is, I know not: But Monsieur <hi>S. Giles</hi> is a great Scholar, and a Sober Man; and one that gave the late L. <hi>Brooke</hi> so good Content, that he allow'd him One Hundred Pound a Year during his Life. Secondly, Because 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known that <hi>Clara</hi> is an <hi>English</hi> man, and <hi>S. Giles</hi> a <hi>French</hi> man born and bred.
<q>
                           <p>Thirdly, Because their own Article, upon which <note place="margin">
                                 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                                    <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                                 </gap> 7th Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</note> they bring this Charge, acknowledges them two distinct Persons. Fourthly, Because both Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> had Monsieur <hi>S. Giles</hi> before them in Examination, and could not but know him to be a <hi>French</hi> man. As appears by a Warrant given to him by Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> to secure him after his Examination. Which Warrant follows in these words:</p>
                           <p>These are to Certifie those whom it may concern, That the Committee of the House of <hi>Commons,</hi> appointed to prosecute the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> have examined and received Satisfaction from Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>S. Giles,</hi> a Domestick Servant to the Resident of <hi>Venice;</hi> and therefore he is no farther to be examined or molested concerning the same</p>
                           <p>This License came to my Hands since my Answering was past; so I could not then shew it. Monsieur <hi>S: Giles</hi> was never the Man that gave me notice of any of this; not so much as that he had been Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined: But my Secretary Mr: <hi>Dell</hi> came to hear of it by chance, and went to him, and had this Copy (with some labour) from him, and will make Oath it is a true Copy. This is not the thankfullest part  at ever <hi>S. Giles</hi> played, considering my Carriage towards him.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Then they charged upon Monsieur <hi>S. Giles</hi> directly, <hi>That I knew him to be a Priest, and yet maintained him at</hi> Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. The Case was this: Mr: <hi>S: Giles</hi> was <note place="margin">The Archbishop related this Case more at large, and therewith defended himself in a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Paper; which being seized by <hi>Pryn</hi> in the Tower, was now produced and read before the Lords. It may be found in <hi>Pryn's</hi> Compl. Hist. <hi>p. 428. H. W.</hi>
                        </note> in good Place about the <hi>Queen's Majesty</hi> at her first coming: Here he did so good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to this State, that he lost himself in <hi>France,</hi> and durst not go thither when the <hi>French</hi> were sent away. All this while the Man was unknown to me, till his <hi>Majesty</hi> one day at St. <hi>James's</hi> told me this, and that he was a Priest, and that it lay upon him in Honour to allow him some Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; and prescribed me a way how to order it, that he might receive One Hundred Marks a Year as from him: And gave me Charge, if the Pension were at any time behind, I should acquaint him with it. After this Mr. <hi>S: Giles</hi> by his Friends Petition'd his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi> that being a Stranger, he might live in <hi>Oxford,</hi> to have the use of the Library there, being resolved to meddle no more with the Controversies of the Time; but to apply himself to <hi>Metaphysical</hi> Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. His <hi>Majesty</hi> was desirous to have him plac'd in some College, to save Charges: But this I most humbly deprecated, because it might be dangerous to the Youth there, and scandalous to his <hi>Majesty,</hi> the Church, and the University; and dangerous to my self, being Chancellor. To the rest I submitted: So he was left to place himself in some Town-House, as he could. And for this his <hi>Majesty</hi> gave me his
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:54614:205" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>Warrant,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> in his Search took from me. But here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the true Copy of it.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Charles Rex.</p>
                        <p>CAnterbury, <hi>Mr: S: Giles</hi> by serving us and this State, hath lost all his hopes in <hi>France,</hi> and desires to spend his time here at his private Studies. I would have you think upon some way for his Maintenance, and to place him in <hi>Oxford,</hi> that he may have use of that Library, which he much desires. And you may so order it,  that his Profession in Religion may do no harm.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>And according to this direction of <hi>his Majesty</hi> I did take Order; but with assurance from himself, and with Spies upon him there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the special care of the Vice-Chancellor, that he should not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with young Students, nor Exercise his Priestly Office, nor do any thing against the Laws. Nor did I ever hear, that he failed in any of these Assumptions.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Then they produced one Mr. <hi>Broad,</hi> who testified, <hi>that while</hi> S: Giles <hi>lived at</hi> Oxford, <hi>some Doctors came to him.</hi> Doctors were able to deal well enough with him; but all resort of young Scholars was forbidden. He says farther, <hi>that</hi> Mr: S: Giles <hi>should say, that the Bishops of</hi> England <hi>were Cordially of his Religion, but that he feared their Rigidness would spoil all.</hi> First, this is but a Report of his Speech. Secondly, why was not <hi>S: Giles</hi> at his Examination asked, whether he said it or no? And if he did, what ground he had for it? At the most, 'twas but his Opinion of the Bishops, who were never the more Cordial to <hi>Popery,</hi> for his thinking so.
<q>
                           <p>And Thirdly, I doubt it appears by this time, that all is overthrown, or near it, not by the Rigidness, but by the over-remisness of some Bishops, who never would believe any danger could come from the <hi>Godly,</hi> as they  were called.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Lastly, What's the Reason of this great Endeavour, upon nothing but News in a Letter, to make <hi>S: Clara,</hi> and Mr. <hi>S: Giles,</hi> to be one and the same Man?
<q>
                           <p>Doubtless, nothing but an Hydropical Thirst  after my Blood.</p>
                        </q>
For resort of Priests to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> was usual in both my last Predecessors Times, <hi>Bancroft's</hi> and <hi>Abbot's.</hi> And some lay in the House and had Relief. This was proved to <hi>the Lords</hi> by two Ancient Servants of that House. Neither of which have been done in my Time. <hi>Arch-Bishop Abbot</hi> made a Warrant (this War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant was shewed) to secure Mr. <hi>Preston</hi> an <hi>English</hi> Priest, upon a <note n="*" place="margin">Confer. at Hamp. Court. p. <hi>51.</hi>
                        </note> Command of King <hi>James:</hi> Why may not I a <hi>French</hi> one, by the Warrant of King <hi>Charles?</hi> King <hi>James</hi> justified Bishop <hi>Bancroft</hi> for doing this, when he was Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and no Privy Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor: And may not I do it, being <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> and <hi>Privy Counsellor,</hi> with as much Privity of <hi>the King</hi> and the State, as he did?

                           <p>God of his Mercy grant, that this Thirst after my Blood lye not too heavy another day upon their Souls. Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> in Summing up the Charge, fell upon this also.

And <hi>his Majesty</hi> very Prudently and Religiously (yet in a calm way, the Persons offering it, having Relation to some Embassador) freed me speedily of that, both Trouble and Danger. They urged further out of the Papers of <hi>Andreas ab Habernfield</hi> (which Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> took from me in his search) <hi>That Signior</hi> Con <hi>had power to offer me a Cardinal's Hat.</hi> The words which they cite, are (for I could never get sight of those Papers since) <hi>Mandatum habuit offerre, sed non obtulit.</hi> What Power he had to make me such an Offer, I know not; but themselves confess he did not offer it. Nor had I ever any Speech with him, during all the time he stayed here. I was solicited as much by Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Friends to give him Admittance to me at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> with Assurance he should speak nothing about Religion, as ever I had about any thing in my Life. I still refused, and could not perswade my self to do other; and yet could not but inwardly (<hi>In Verbo Sacerdotis,</hi>

this is true) condemn my self of gross Incivility for refusing. For which yet now I see I am much bound to God for that Unmannerli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Had I held a Correspondence with him, though never so Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, where had I now been? Besides, I would not have it forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that if <hi>to offer a Cardinal's Hat,</hi> or any like thing, shall be a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Cause to make a Man guilty of Treason, it shall be in the power of any <hi>Romanist,</hi> to make any <hi>English</hi> Bishop a Traytor when he pleases: A Mischief not to be indured.

                     <p>The Second consists of a great many Particulars, and most of <note place="margin">II.</note> them urged before, repeated only to help to make the Ignorant cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous and wild against me. God forgive them this Practice.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The First Particular was <hi>Shelford's</hi> Book: <hi>The whole Book.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> very gravely said, that <hi>this Book and the other two following, were found in my Study.</hi> Is he not yet ashamed of this Argument?

                     <p n="2">2. The Second was, Dr. <hi>Heylin's</hi> Book against Mr. <hi>Burton.</hi> This Book was Printed by my Command (they say) <hi>And in it is a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage for Absolute Obedience to Kings. p.</hi> 229.

                        </gap> to put any thing unjustifiable into it. This Passage I caused to be read to <hi>the Lords,</hi> and the Doctor there says no more than what he Learned of King <hi>James</hi> in the Conference at <hi>Hampton Court.</hi> But if any thing be amiss, he is ready to Answer it. But I find not one word in him, that this Absolute Obedience ought to be in any thing that is against Law.
<q>
                           <p>That's one of Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> his Stretches.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third Particular is Bishop <hi>Mountague's Appeal,</hi> p. 141. But nothing hence charged upon me, but only, that the Book was found in my Study. I would Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> could find any Books there now.</p>

4. The Fourth was, <hi>That divers Books of like nature were Licensed by my Chaplains.</hi> But none was of all they then named, but Dr. <hi>Heylin's,</hi> and <hi>Sales;</hi> of which your <hi>Lordships</hi> have heard the Plot how it came to be Licensed. And for Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> he is ready to make all good, which he hath therein done.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Fifth Particular is, That the <hi>Homilies</hi> which are Authorised in the Church of <hi>England, make the Pope Antichrist,</hi> p. 216. <hi>And the Babylonish Beast of</hi> Rome, p. 316. But First, This is nothing against me, till it be proved, (which yet is not done) That I have positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denied the <hi>Pope</hi> to be <hi>Antichrist.</hi> And Secondly, I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which confirms the <note place="margin">Art. <hi>35.</hi> Eccl. Ang.</note> 
                        <hi>Homilies,</hi> doth also confirm every Phrase that is in them. Nor, Thirdly, Do I conceive that the <hi>Homilies</hi> in those places which are cited, do make the <hi>Pope the great Antichrist.</hi> For, in the first place, the Words are, <hi>To the beating down of Sin, Death, the Pope, the Devil, and all the Kingdom of Antichrist:</hi> Which Words cannot possibly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>that Antichrist.</hi> In the second place, he is only called the <hi>Babylonical Beast of</hi> Rome; which Phrase doth not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily signifie <hi>The Great Antichrist.</hi> For the Beast so often mentioned in the <note n="*" place="margin">Cap. <hi>11. 7.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Revelation,</hi> is no where called the <hi>Babylonical Beast of</hi> Rome.
<q>
                           <p>And if that Beast do stand for the <hi>Great Antichrist,</hi> (I say <hi>If,</hi> because those Scriptures are very dark) then <note n="‖" place="margin">Annot. in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poc. <hi>17. 8.</hi>
                              </note> the Beast is primarily the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire</hi> in the Judgment of the <hi>Geneva Noters.</hi> And that there should be two great <hi>Antichrists,</hi> is more than any man hath yet said. Here Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> was up again with <hi>Pander to the Whore of</hi> Babylon, and his other foul Language; not remembring all this while, (which yet I was loath to mind him of) that one of his zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Witnesses against the <hi>Whore of Babylon,</hi> and all her Superstitions, got all his Means (which are great) by being a <hi>Pander</hi> to other lewd Women; and loved the business it self so well, as that he was (not long since, men say) taken in Bed with one of his Wife's Maids. Good Mr. <hi>Nicolas,</hi> do not dispense with all Whores, save  the Whore of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Sixth Particular was, <hi>the Articles of</hi> Ireland, <hi>which call the</hi> Pope <hi>the Man of Sin.</hi> But the Articles of <hi>Ireland</hi> bind neither this Church, nor me. And some Learned <hi>Protestants</hi> do not understand that noted place of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. as meant of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> or <note place="margin">2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.</note> the <hi>Pope.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Seventh and Last Particular is, a Repetition of <hi>Sancta Clara</hi> and Mr. <hi>S. Giles;</hi> and the <hi>Letter of News,</hi> (which were News indeed) <hi>to make them one Man;</hi> though this were Answered at large but the last Day; and Sir <hi>Ed. Hungerford's</hi> Testimony <hi>brought up again.</hi> It's a sign Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> hath indeed <hi>no down-right right Proof</hi> (as he said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) that so tumbles up and down in repeating the same things.</p>
                     <p>The Third Charge is, that I say in my Book, <hi>That the Religion of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">III.</note> 
                        <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>and ours is all one.</hi> This is spoken only in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition <note place="margin">My Book cont. <hi>Fisher, p. 376.</hi>
                        </note> to other Religions, in regard of Christianity. The Words are, <hi>Nor do the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>and the</hi> Protestants <hi>set up a different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; for the</hi> Christian <hi>Religion is the same to both,</hi> &amp;c. And the like passage to this is in my <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. <hi>36.</hi>
                        </note> Speech in the Star-Chamber. And these Passages were read to the <hi>Lords.</hi> So that either <hi>Papists</hi> must be
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:54614:207"/>
denied to be <hi>Christians,</hi> or else this Charge can work nothing against me.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth Charge is out of <hi>Chouneus his Book,</hi> p. 45, &amp; 46. <hi>Licensed by my Chaplain Dr.</hi> Braye, <hi>where</hi> (they say) <hi>'tis said, That</hi> Rome <hi>is a True</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">IV.</note> 
                        <hi>Church, and differs not in Fundamentals.</hi> And <hi>that at the High Commission,</hi> when this Book was question'd by some, <hi>I did say that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>and the Protestants did not differ in Fundamentals, but in Circumstances.</hi> And this latter part was testified by Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Lane,</hi> who said they were present. First, Suppose this be false, and that they do differ in Fundamentals; yet this then is but my Errour in Divinity, no Practice to overthrow Religion. Secondly, I suppose, if I did so say, I did not Err: For the Foundations of <hi>Christian</hi> Religion are the Articles of the Creed, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> denies no one of them: Therefore there is no difference in the Fundamentals. If they of <hi>Rome</hi> differ in Exposition of some of these, that must needs be a Superstructure upon, or beside the Article, not the Article or Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it self. Nor did I follow my own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment herein, but <note n="*" place="margin">Quemadmodum sape <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>As for that which was said in the beginning of this Charge, <hi>That</hi> Rome <hi>is a True Church:</hi> I ever did, and ever must grant it, that such it is <hi>Veritate Entis,</hi> in the Truth of it's Entity and Being.

And every thing that hath a Being, is truly that Being which it is in truth of Substance; but a Right or an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Church I never said it was, either in Doctrine or Manners. As a Thief is a true Man in Verity of his Essence, that is, he is a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture indued with Reason; but it doth not therefore follow that he is a true Man <hi>Veritate Moris,</hi> in his Life and Conversation.
<q>
                           <p>And this I answered first to the <hi>Lords,</hi> and after to Mr. <hi>Brown's</hi> Summary Charge, who in his last Reply said two things: First, <hi>That when I said</hi> Rome <hi>was a True Church, I spake it generally without this Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> But this is quite beyond the Proof; for no Witness says so. Besides, it is manifest by distinction of Fundamentals from other Doctrines, (acknowledged by both the Witnesses) that I did not speak it absolutely, but plain enough to any ordinary Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Secondly, (which I was very sorry to hear from so grave a Man) he added, <hi>That there was no Truth of a Church, but in the Verity of Doctrine and Manners; and that in</hi> Veritate Entis <hi>a Company of</hi> Turks <hi>were a True Church.</hi> Now God be merciful to us, whither are we posting? 'Tis known that the Greek Word <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, which signifies <hi>Church,</hi> signifies also in <hi>Heathen</hi> Authors, any kind of <hi>Company</hi> or <hi>Congregation</hi> of Men, <hi>Turks</hi> if you will. But in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Writers, and among all <hi>Christians</hi> the Word <hi>Church</hi> is used only (and so <gap reason="foreign">

And will any Man say that a Company of <hi>Turks</hi> are such a Church in <hi>Veritate Entis,</hi> in the Verity of this Being; as all the World knows <hi>Papists</hi> are? Or if he will not speak <hi>de Ente tali,</hi> but change the <hi>Suppositum,</hi> he may say what he please. But I was very much  troubled to hear this, and from him.</p>

again, where 'tis said, <hi>That the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>and their Adherents are not the true Church.</hi> But the Answer is easie: For I say as the <hi>Homily</hi> doth, and as it means too in that place. Namely, that <hi>the Church of Rome</hi> is not the <hi>true,</hi> that is, not the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, nor the <hi>Head</hi> thereof. But there is a great deal of difference between <hi>the Church,</hi> and <hi>a Church:</hi> The one is the General, the other a Particular. <hi>The Church</hi> it cannot be; <hi>A Church</hi> it is, and a true one too, in the Sense before specified. Upon occasion of this Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> his Mouth was open again, and said, That at the beginning I reckon'd up some that I had Converted: But if this were my Opinion, and that if this might stand for good, <hi>I might Convert the Devil and all.</hi> My Ears had been so beaten with his Language, that I was pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and left him to insult. And to help on this business, while he was in these loud Expressions, the <hi>E. of Pembrook</hi> came to Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> to the Bar, and in my hearing desired him to repeat the Testimony he had given; which Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> did, and his <hi>Lordship</hi> seemed to be much pleased with it. Not long before, when the News was come hot to the House, that <hi>York</hi> was taken; when I came at Five in the Afternoon to make my Answer, I was no sooner come to the Bar, but the same <hi>Lord</hi> came and sat just before me, and there with much Joy told Mr. <hi>Lieutenant</hi> the News. I presume he did it in favour to me, because he thought it would put me in very good Heart, being then instantly to begin to make my Answer.

                     <p>The Seventh Charge is out of my <hi>Diary</hi> at <hi>June:</hi> 15: 1632. where <note place="margin">VII.</note> 'tis said, that <hi>I preferred Mr: Secretary</hi> Windebank, <hi>my old Friend.</hi> And here Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> laid all the Correspondency open, which (he said) that Gentleman had with the <hi>Popes</hi> Agents, with Priests and Jesuits, and when he had made him this way as foul as he could, <hi>then I must be guilty of all, for preferring such a Man to the King.</hi> This Gentleman was indeed my ancient Friend: In my many Years Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him, I saw nothing in him, but Honesty and Worth: If when he was preferred, he deceived my Opinion, he is living to answer for himself.

                        </q>
that a Youth of Seventeen at the most, should insinuate himself to Fish any thing out of him for his Fathers Service. Lastly, he pressed, <hi>that my Interest continued with Mr. Secretary in all these Courses of his.</hi> 'Tis well known in Court the old Interest did not continue between us; but for old Friendships sake, I will not be drawn to say more. As <hi>for his releasing of any Priests,</hi> he must give an account of that himself. But for my self, I was so careful in this Particular, that I never put my Hand, though Publick at <hi>Council-Table,</hi> or <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> to any Release in all my time. I might be named as present, when such Release was made (which I could not avoid) but act in any I did not. Nay, I was so careful that I refused to set my Hand to any License to Travel, lest if any Young Man should be perverted abroad in his Travels, any thing might be imputed to me. And this all the Clerks of the Council can Witness.

                     <p>The Eighth Charge was, <hi>my Correspondence with</hi> Popish <hi>Priests.</hi> And <note place="margin">VIII.</note> for Proof of this, they produced divers Witnesses.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The First Witness was one <hi>Wadsworth,</hi> one of the Common Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers used to attach such Persons. He says, <hi>that</hi> Smith, <hi>aliàs</hi> Fludd, <hi>bragged to him, that he had acquaintance with me.</hi> Here's nothing but a Bragging Report of <hi>Smith,</hi> who what he is I know not. So here's
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:54614:209"/>
no Proof. He says, <hi>that Four Pound was sent to himself to free him out of Prison, and that</hi> Davis <hi>told him it came from me.</hi> This is but a Hearsay from <hi>Davis,</hi> as the former was from <hi>Smith.</hi> But say, <hi>my Lords,</hi> if I did send him Four Pound to free him out of Prison, doth he not now very thankfully reward me for it? The Truth is, <hi>my Lords,</hi> I did send him Four Pound: And the Motive that made me send it, was because I heard he was a Convert from <hi>Popery</hi> to be a <hi>Protestant,</hi> and that his Imprisonment was as much for that as for any thing else. And this was attested to <hi>the Lords,</hi> by my Servant Mr. <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> who was one of them that moved me for him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Second Witness was <hi>Francis Newton,</hi> another Messenger. He says, <hi>that when he had taken</hi> Henry Mors <hi>a Priest, he should have been carried to a private Committee; that he disliked it, and Complained to Mr. Secretary</hi> Cook, <hi>who</hi> (he says) <hi>sent him to me; and that when he came to</hi> Lambeth, <hi>Mr.</hi> Dell <hi>told him, I was in my Garden with Sir</hi> To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Matthew. My Servant Mr. <hi>Dell</hi> being appointed my Solicitor was now present in Court, and denyed all this. And well he might, for Sir <hi>Toby</hi> was never in my Garden with me in all his Life. And if <hi>Mr.</hi> Dell <hi>told him, that I would not meddle in the Business,</hi> (as he says he did) Mr. <hi>Dell</hi> must give the Account for it, not I. Yet if there were a Reference of this <hi>Mors</hi> to a private Committee, the hindring of that was more proper to <hi>Mr. Secretary,</hi> than to me. Howsoever, here was no hurt done. For he confesses <hi>that</hi> Mors <hi>was sent back to</hi> Newgate. And if (as he farther says) <hi>he was discharged by Mr. Secretary</hi> Windebank, that is nothing to me. He says, <hi>he was informed by</hi> Stukely, <hi>that</hi> Smith <hi>aliàs</hi> Fludd, <hi>was acquainted with me.</hi> But if he were but informed so himself, that's no Proof to inform <hi>your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships.</hi> He says, <hi>that</hi> Brown <hi>a Priest was dismissed out of the High-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</hi> Thus it was, He was called in thither, for very foul Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness. In process of this Business, he there openly confessed himself a Priest. Hereupon that Court sent him to <hi>Newgate.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>What became of him after, I know not, save that I know he was  strictly examined by Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> and others concerning me.</p>
                        </q>
This <hi>Newton,</hi> upon what Grudge I know not, calls me Rogue, and all to naught, in all Companies; and with so much I acquainted <hi>the Lords.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Third Witness was <hi>Tho. Mayo,</hi> a Messenger also. He says, <hi>that Sir</hi> Toby Matthew <hi>was accounted a Priest when he was in parts beyond the Seas, and that he saw him in Coach with me, and that he went over with me in my Barge.</hi> First I gave in Two Exceptions against this Witness. One that he was a Man of no Conscience, for he had shifted his Religion from <hi>Protestant</hi> to <hi>Papist,</hi> and back again three or four times: Which was a thing known. The other was, that he kept a Brothel House at this present: And that his Fellow <hi>Wadsworth</hi> knew this, and called him Pimping Knave, saying, he kept a Brace of Wenches at this time in his House. And these Words he spake of him but the Fifth of this present <hi>July,</hi> in the <hi>Bull</hi> Tavern in the <hi>Palace-Yard.</hi> So I thought him no fit Witness. But he was heard for all this.
<q>
                           <p>And afterwards, <hi>Wadsworth</hi> meeting my Servant Mr. <hi>Snath,</hi> he told him, that he did say so to <hi>Mayo,</hi> and wondred how  I should come to hear it.</p>
                        </q>
Being admitted, and saying as he did, I told <hi>the Lords,</hi> that he began with a very bold Oath, and like a shifter
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:54614:210"/>
of his Religion. For I had Four of my Servants there, Three of which usually attended me, when I went and returned from Court, Mr. <hi>Dell,</hi> Mr. <hi>Snath,</hi> Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dobson,</hi> and they all attested the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; and I never went, but one of these at least was with me. Besides, he is single in this Testimony. He says, <hi>that he saw Sir</hi> Toby <hi>several times in my House.</hi> But he confesses withal, that he never saw him near me. For my own part I cannot say, that ever he was within my Doors. But if he, or others of his Quality, do come to pry out any thing in my House, how is it possible for me to hinder it? My Porter could not see it written in their Foreheads, who they were. He says, <hi>That one</hi> Price <hi>was often seen at my House.</hi> But he doth not say, he was seen with me, or there with my Knowledge. He says, <hi>That one</hi> Leander <hi>was Reported to have been my Chamber-Fellow in</hi> Oxford. First, this is but a Report, and so no Evidence. Secondly, if he were my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-Fellow in <hi>Oxford,</hi> when we were Boys together, I am sure he was then no Priest, and he was but a Boy when he left the College. He confesses, that I gave Order to observe who, and how many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorted to Embassadours Houses, and Signior <hi>Conn's,</hi> and says, he thought I could prove it. But I believe he would never have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed it, but that he knew I could prove it. And thereupon I shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>the Lords</hi> many Papers certifying me what Numbers were found resorting to each place respectively. And <hi>Thomas Mayo's</hi> Hand to many of those Papers. He says, <hi>he took one</hi> Peter Wilford <hi>and brought him to me to</hi> Whitehall, <hi>while Sir</hi> Jo. Lambe <hi>was with me.</hi> But he confesses withal that <hi>Wilford</hi> then shewed Mr. <hi>Secretary Windebank's</hi> Warrant to Discharge him: And then what could I do to him? Nay, I have some Cause to think he would never have apprehended him, had he not known he had that Warrant. Lastly, he says, <hi>that once at the</hi> Star-Chamber <hi>I told him he was too quick and nimble for me.</hi> And I hope it is no Treason if I did say so. Nor could I mean he was too quick in apprehending Priests, for I found both him, and his Fellows after <hi>Crosse's</hi> Death slow enough at that: But if I said so, it was because I could not tell how to trust his Shifting and his Wyliness.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Fourth Witness was <hi>Elizabeth Graye,</hi> Wife to another Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger. And this is a very fine Witness. For first, she says, <hi>Her Husband was committed by my Means.</hi> And then with a Breath she says, <hi>She doth not know by whom he was committed, but she thinks by Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> Windebank <hi>and me.</hi> But since she doth not know, but think only; I hope her <hi>Thinking</hi> can be no Evidence. She says, <hi>that she delivered me a Petition, and that I flung it away, saying, I would not meddle with any Priest-catching Knave.</hi> The Witness single, and I doubt doating, and the Words far from Treason.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Fifth Witness was <hi>John Cooke,</hi> a Messenger too, and one that for his Misdemeanour had stood in the Pillory. This I urged against him, as unfit to witness against me:
<q>
                           <p>My Witness that saw him in the Pillory, was so threatned, that he sent me word he  durst not come.</p>
                        </q>
I may not say from whom this Threatning came. But the thing was so true, that <hi>Cooke</hi> himself confessed it, but excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Cause; And his Testimony received. He told <hi>how</hi> Fisher <hi>the Jesuit was taken by</hi> Graye: <hi>That when he was brought to the</hi> Council-Table,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:54614:210"/>
                        <hi>Secretary</hi> Cooke <hi>and I went to</hi> the King <hi>to know his Pleasure about him: That we brought back word from</hi> his Majesty <hi>to the Lords, that he should be Banished.</hi> All this while here's no hurt done. Then he says, <hi>that notwithstanding this Order of his Majesty,</hi> Graye <hi>and he met</hi> Fisher <hi>at Liberty, by a Warrant from Secretary</hi> Windebank: <hi>That hereupon</hi> Graye <hi>repaired to Secretary</hi> Cooke, <hi>and to me, and that</hi> Dell <hi>told him I would not meddle with it.</hi> My Secretary must answer this, I remember it not. But if Mr. <hi>Dell</hi> received any such Answer from me, that <hi>I would not meddle with it;</hi> there were two apparent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for it. One, that I would not meddle with it alone, <hi>his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's</hi> Order being to all <hi>the Lords.</hi> The other, that <hi>Fisher</hi> was the Man I had written against, and Men would have been apt to say, that when I could not answer, I sought means to destroy: So I no way fit (alone at least) to meddle with him of all Men. He says, <hi>that</hi> Graye <hi>was committed to the</hi> Fleet, <hi>for Railing on me in my own House.</hi> Yet he confesses, that he was not committed by me. And I presume <hi>your Lordships</hi> will think there was Cause of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment, if he did Rail upon me. And 'tis confessed by Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Pop. Roy. Favourit. p. <hi>31.</hi>
                        </note> (though he had then received no Answer from my self) <hi>that he said he saw now how the Game went, and hoped e're long to see better Days,</hi> &amp;c. He says, <hi>that</hi> Smith, <hi>alias</hi> Fludd, <hi>desired Sir</hi> Kenelm Digbye, <hi>as he was going to</hi> Lambeth, <hi>to tell me that he could not Dine with me that Day, but desired his Business might be remembred.</hi> No such Man ever Dined at my Table, to my knowledge. And if any Priest would say so to Sir <hi>Kenelm,</hi> how could I possibly hinder it? And Sir <hi>Kenelm,</hi> when this <hi>Cooke</hi> was Examined, was a Prisoner in <hi>Winchester-House;</hi> why was not he Examined to sift out this Truth? If Truth be in it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Sixth Witness was <hi>John Thresher,</hi> a Messenger too: He says, <hi>that he took</hi> Mors <hi>and</hi> Goodwin, <hi>two Priests; and that Secretary</hi> Windebank <hi>took away his Warrant, and dismissed them, saying, he would speak with me about it. And that when he came to me, I was angry with him about the Warrant.</hi> Mr. Secretary <hi>Windebank</hi> will, I hope, be able to answer for his own Actions. Why he dismiss'd the Priests I know not; But he had great Reason to take away his Warrant: And I a greater Reason to be angry with him for it. For no Warrant can issue from the <hi>High-Commission</hi> Court, but under three of their Hands at least. Now <hi>Thresher</hi> having gotten my Hand to the Warrant, never goes for more Hands, but proceeds in his Office, upon this unwarrantable Warrant. Had not I Reason to be offended at this? He says, <hi>that at the same time I said that</hi> Graye <hi>was an ill-tongued Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and that if he kept him Company, I should not regard him.</hi> I had good Cause to say this and more, considering how <hi>Graye</hi> had us'd me. And I believe no <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> would have born his Words. Lastly, he says, <hi>that by a Warrant from me he Arrested Sir</hi> Toby Matthewe, <hi>and that the Earl of</hi> Strafford <hi>stayed him from going to Prison, saying, he should answer it before the Lords.</hi> Here by the Witness himself it appears that I did my Duty. And Sir <hi>Toby</hi> did appear before the Lords, as was <note n="*" place="margin">assured.</note> assumed he should. In the mean time, I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of to <hi>the Queen:</hi> And a great Lady (who perhaps made the Complaint) stood by, and made her self Merry to hear me chid:
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:54614:211"/>
                        <hi>The Queen</hi> was pleased to send to the Lords, and Sir <hi>Toby</hi> was releas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Where my Fault was in all this, I do not yet see.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The last of these famous Witnesses was <hi>Goldsmith.</hi> Who says nothing, but <hi>that one Day before the</hi> High-Commission Court <hi>began, I forewarned the Messengers of that Court of</hi> Graye, <hi>in regard he was openly spoken against at the</hi> Council-Table. Which, all things considered, I had great Reason to do. He says likewise, <hi>that then</hi> Graye's <hi>Wife tender'd me a Petition, which I rejected, saying, I would meddle with no Priest-catching Knaves.</hi> I think his Carriage deserv'd no better of me, than to reject his Petition: But as for the Words I cannot own them; let the <hi>Goldsmith</hi> look to it that he have not Forged them. And I <note place="margin">Frigidc dictum. <hi>W. S. A. C.</hi>
                        </note> would very willingly know whether when <hi>the Apostle</hi> required, <hi>that an Accusation should not be received against an Elder, but under two or three Witnesses,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. he had any meaning they should be such <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5: 19:</note> as these?</p>
                     <p>The Ninth Charge was <hi>about the ordering of</hi> Popish <hi>Books that were</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">IX.</note> 
                        <hi>seized, and the disposing of them.</hi> The sole Witness here is <hi>John Eger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi> He says, <hi>These Books were delivered to Mr.</hi> Mattershead, <hi>Register to the</hi> High-Commission. And I say so too; it was the constant Course of the <hi>High-Commission,</hi> to send them thither, and have them kept in that Office, till there was a sufficient number of them, and then to burn them. Yea, but he adds, <hi>that</hi> Mattershead <hi>told him they were re-delivered to the Owners:</hi> This is but a Report, and <hi>Mattershead</hi> is dead, who should make it good.
<q>
                           <p>And though this be but a single Witness, and of a dead Man's Report; yet Mr. <hi>Browne</hi> thought fit to Summ it up with the rest. But surely if any Books were redelivered to the Owners; it was so ordered by the <hi>High-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,</hi> in regard the Books were not found dangerous: From me,  <hi>Mattershead</hi> had never any such Command.</p>
                        </q>
Lastly, he says, <hi>he met Sir</hi> Toby Matthew <hi>twice at</hi> Lambeth. But he confesses, he never saw him with me; and then me it cannot concern.</p>
                     <p>The Tenth Charge was concerning the <hi>Priests in Newgate;</hi> the <note place="margin">X.</note> Witnesses are Mr. <hi>Deuxel,</hi> and <hi>Francis Newton.</hi> They both agree, and they say, <hi>that the Priests there had the best Chambers, and Liberty to go abroad without Keepers.</hi> I hope these Men do not mean to make <hi>the Arch-Bishop of Canterbury</hi> Keeper of <hi>Newgate.</hi> If any Man gave them this Liberty, he is to be blamed for it, not I, who never knew it till now. Nor do either of these Witnesses say, that they called on me for remedy, or ever did so much as acquaint me with it. And they say <hi>this was Twelve Years since;</hi> and I had been <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> but Seven Years when I was Committed.</p>
                     <p>The Eleventh Charge was about words in my <hi>Epistle Dedicatory</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">XI.</note> my Book against Mr. <hi>Fisher.</hi> The Words these, <hi>For, to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, I have not given him, or his, so much as course Language.</hi> So the Charge is because I have not given ill Words. And here Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> fell foul upon me again for taking such care, that <hi>the Whore of Babylon</hi> may have nothing but good Words, &amp;c. But First, <hi>my Lords,</hi> I have always thought, and do still, that ill Language is no Proof against an Adversary: All the good it can do is, it may bring Scorn upon the Author, and work hardness of Heart in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary, whom he doth, or should labour to Convert. And this I

                     <p>The Last Charge was the Commitment of one <hi>Ann Hussy</hi> to the <note place="margin">XII.</note> Sheriff of <hi>London.</hi> The Business was this. She sent one <hi>Philip Bam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> to tell me of I know not what Plot against <hi>the King</hi> (nor I think she neither.) <hi>Bambridge</hi> came to <hi>White-Hall</hi> toward the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and could make nothing of this dangerous Plot. Yet because it pretended so high, I sent him presently to <hi>Mr: Secretary Windebank;</hi> I being the next Morning to go out of Town. The Business was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Council-Table. When I came back, I was present there. <hi>Bambridge</hi> produced <hi>Ann Hussy,</hi> but she could make nothing appear. She says, <hi>I thought she was out of her Wits.</hi> Not so, <hi>my Lords;</hi> but I did not think she was well in them; nor do I yet. And whereas <hi>she complains of her Imprisonment,</hi> it was her own desire she might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Sheriff; and Mr. <hi>Hearn</hi> (my Councel here present) was assigned by <hi>the Lords</hi> to take her Examination. Therefore if any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in this Charge stick with <hi>your Lordships,</hi> I humbly desire Mr. <hi>Hearn</hi> may supply my want of Memory.

                              <hi>Art. 14.</hi> That to preserve himself from being questioned for these, and other his Traiterous Courses; he hath laboured to subvert the Rights of Parliaments, and the ancient Course of Parliamentary Proceedings, and by false and malicious Slanders to incense his Majesty against Parliaments. By which Words, Councels and Actions, he hath Traiterously, and contrary to his Allegiance, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to alienate the Hearts of the King's Liege People from his Majesty, to set a Division between them, and to ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy his Majesty's Kingdoms.

                     </p>
                     <p>The First Charge of this Day was Prefaced with a Note out <note place="margin">I.</note> of my <hi>Diary,</hi> at <hi>May</hi> 8. 1626. That <hi>the Duke of</hi> Buckingham <hi>was that Day impeached to the Lords by the House of Commons.</hi> And at <hi>May</hi> 25. <hi>The difference arising in the House of Peers about the Earl of</hi> Arundel's <hi>Commitment to the</hi> Tower <hi>without a Cause declared.</hi> No use made of these, but that I then <hi>Bishop of S. Davids</hi> took notice of these things. <note place="margin">See <hi>Heylin's</hi> Life of Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> p. <hi>152.</hi>
                        </note> Then the Charge followed; and the First of it was, <hi>That I then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lords House, and so to be one of the Duke's Judges, made a Speech for him, and Corrected his Speech in some particulars; and of a Judge made my self an Advocate.</hi> Which Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> said was a great Offence. I saw not these Papers, and therefore can say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, what is, or is not under my Hand. But to the thing it self, I say first, that if in that Speech any particular Fault had been found, impeaching any Right or Power of Parliament, that I must have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered; but none is charged, but only the bare making of one Speech, and the mending of another. And this is a very poor Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of any Enmity against Parliaments. Secondly, seeing no Fault is charged upon me in particular, it was but the Office of a poor Friend, to a great one, to whom being so much bound as I was, I could not refuse so much Service, being intreated to it. And Thirdly, I do humbly conceive, that so long as there was nothing done against Law, any Friend may privately assist another in his Difficulties. And I am perswaded, many Friends in either House, do what they justly may, when such sad Occasions happen.

                           <p>And this Answer I gave to Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> when he Summed up my Charge in the House of Commons.</p>
                           <p>But Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> did not begin with this, but with another, here omitted by Mr. <hi>Nicolas;</hi> though he had pressed it before in the
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:54614:212" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Fifteenth day of my Hearing, Dr. <hi>Potter</hi> writ unto me for my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in some Passages of a Book writ by him, (as I remember against a Book Intituled <hi>Charity mistaken.</hi>) I did not think it fit to amend any thing with my own Pen; but put some few things back to his Second Thoughts, of which this was one, <hi>That if he express him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so, he will give as much Power to the Parliament in Matters of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as to the Church.</hi> This, Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> said, took away all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from Parliaments, in that kind. But, under Favour, this takes away nor all, nor any that is due unto them. Not all, for my Words are about <hi>giving so much Power:</hi> Now he that would not have so much given to the one, as the other, doth not take away all from either. Not any that is due to them: For my Words not medling simply with Parliamentary Power (as appears by the Comparative Words <hi>so much</hi>) my Intention must needs be to have Dr. <hi>Potter</hi> so to consider of his Words, as that, that which is proper to the Church, might not be ascribed to Parliaments. And this I conceive is plain in the very Letter of the Law. The Words of the <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1:</note> Statute are, <hi>Or such as shall hereafter be Ordered, Judged, or determined to be Heresy, by the High Court of Parliament in this Realm, with the Assent of the Clergy in their Convocation.</hi> Where 'tis manifest, that the Judging and Determining Part, for the Truth or Falshood of the Doctrin, is in the Church. For <hi>the Assent of the Church</hi> or Clergy cannot be given but in Convocation, and so the Law requires it. Now <hi>Assent in Convocation</hi> cannot be given, but there must preceed a Debate, a Judging, a Voting, and a Determining. Therefore the <hi>Determining Power</hi> for the Truth or Falshood of the Doctrine, Heresie, or no Heresie, is in the Church: But <hi>the Judging and determining Power</hi> for binding to Obedience, and for Punishment, is in the Parliament, with this Assent of the Clergy. Therefore I humbly conceive, the Parliament cannot by Law, that is, till this Law be first altered, Determine the Truth of Doctrine without this Assent of the Church in Convocation. And that such a Synod and Convocation as is Chosen and Assembled as the Laws and Customs of this Realm require.</p>
                           <p>To this Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> in his Reply upon me in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, said Two Things. The one, <hi>that this Branch of the Statute of one</hi> Eliz. <hi>was for Heresie only, and the Adjudging of that; but med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not with the Parliaments Power in other matters of Religion.</hi> If it be for Heresie only, that the Church alone shall not so Determine Heresie, as to bring those grievous Punishments which the Law lays upon it, upon the Neck of any Subject, without <hi>Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Parliament;</hi> then is the Church in Convocation left free also in other matters of Religion, according to the First Clause <hi>in Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Charta,</hi> which establishes the Church in all her Rights. And her main and constant Right, when that Charter was made and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, <hi>was Power of Determining in matters of Doctrine and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church.</hi> And this Right of the Clergy is not bounded or limited by any Law, but this Clause of 1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> that ever I heard of.</p>
                           <p>The other was, <hi>that if this were so, that the Parliament might not meddle with Religion, but with the Assent of the Clergy in Convocation,</hi>
                              <pb n="402" facs="tcp:54614:213" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                              <hi>we should have had no Reformation. For the Bishops and the Clergy dissented.</hi> First, it is not (as I conceive) to be denyed, that <hi>the King</hi> and his High Court of Parliament may make any Law what they please, and <hi>by their Absolute Power</hi> may change Religion, <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi> into <hi>Turcism</hi> if they please (which God forbid.) And the Subjects, whose Consciences cannot obey, must flye or indure the Penalty of the Law. But both King and Parliament, are <hi>sub gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viori Regno,</hi> and must Answer God for all such abuse of Power. But beside this Absolute, there is <hi>a Limited Power,</hi> Limited, I say, by Natural Justice and Equity, by which, no Man, no Court, can do <note place="margin">Id possumus quod Jure possu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</note> more, than what he can by Right. And according to this Power, the Church's Interest must be considered, and that indifferently, as well as the Parliaments. To apply this to the Particular of the <hi>Reformation.</hi> The Parliament in the beginning of <hi>Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> would not indure <hi>Popish</hi> Superstition, and by <hi>Absolute Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> Abolished it, <note n="*" place="margin">By the Advice of her Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Council. <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat. to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions.</hi>
                              </note> without any Assent of the Clergy in Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. And then in her first Year, <hi>An.</hi> 1559. She had a <hi>Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> and set out her <hi>Injunctions,</hi> to direct and order such of the Clergy as could conform their Judgments <hi>to the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But then so soon as the Clergy was settled, and that a Form of Doctrine was to be agreed upon, to shew the difference from the <hi>Roman</hi> Superstition, a Synod was called, and in the Year 1562. the <hi>Articles</hi> of Religion were agreed upon, and they were determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and confirmed by Parliament, with the Assent of the Clergy in <hi>Convocation;</hi> and that by a just and orderly Power. Nor is the Absolute Power of King and Parliament any way unjust in it self, but may many ways be made such, by Misinformation, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. And this gives the King and the Parliament their full Power, and yet preserves this Church in her just Right. Just and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by some that loved her not over well.

                     </p>
                     <p>The Second Proof is, <hi>That I made two Speeches for the King, to be spoken or sent to the Parliament that then was; and that they had some sour and ill Passages in them.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>These Speeches were read to the Lords; <note place="margin">II.</note> and had I now the Copies, I would insert them here, and make the World Judge of them. First, I might shuffle here, and deny the <note place="margin">See the <hi>Diary,</hi> at <hi>March</hi> 26, 29. <hi>May</hi> 11. <hi>Anno</hi> 1626. H. W.</note>  making of them:</p>
                        </q>
For no Proof is offer'd, but that they are in my Hand; and that is no necessary Proof: For I had then many Papers by me written in my own Hand, which were not my making, though I transcribed them, as not thinking it fit to trust them in other Hands. But, Secondly, I did make them, and I followed the Instructions which were given me as close as I could to the very Phrases; and being commanded to the Service, I hope it shall not now be made my Crime that I was trusted by my Soveraign. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, As I did never endeavour to imbitter the <hi>King</hi> this way; so the smart Passages which Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> says are there, I hope will not be thought such, when 'tis consider'd whose Mouth was to utter them,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:54614:213"/>
and upon what occasion: Yet if such they shall be thought, I am heartily sorry for them, and humbly desire they may be pass'd by: However, they can make no Proof that I am an Enemy to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<q>
                           <p>And this Answer I gave Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,  for he there omitted it not.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Third Proof that I am an Enemy to Parliaments, is the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony <note place="margin">III.</note> of one Mr. <hi>Bland.</hi> A forward Witness he hath been against me in other Particulars. Here he says, <hi>That Sir</hi> Sackvil Crowe <hi>shewed him a Paper, in which were fifteen or sixteen Passages concerning Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with some sour Aspersions to boot; and that this Paper was Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed</hi> W. Laud. First, <hi>my Lords,</hi> This Man is but a single Witness. Secondly, he says, he had this Paper from Sir <hi>Sackvil Crowe;</hi> and he is now in <hi>Turkey,</hi> and cannot be produced, that the Truth may be known. Thirdly, As I never gave Sir <hi>Sackvil</hi> any such Paper, so had he come by any such, 'tis more than probable some body else might have seen it beside Mr. <hi>Bland,</hi> to make a second Witness. Fourthly, This is a very bold Oath; for he Swears, <hi>The Paper was Subscribed with my own Hand,</hi> W. Laud: Whereas I being then <hi>Bishop of S. Davids,</hi> never writ my Name to any thing other than <hi>Guil. Meneven.</hi> Let him bethink himself of this <hi>Oath, Ne quid gravius dicam.</hi> Besides, it may be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too, that this, with some Particulars mentioned by Mr. <hi>Bland,</hi> was charged in the First Additional Article, and now brought in upon the Fourteenth Original; partly to confound me, that I might not see how, or against what to defend my self; and partly to make me secure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had quite passed over the first Additional. But especially, <note place="margin">Artic. <hi>1.</hi> Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</note> because they had therein charged me, that these Propositions of mine had caused that Parliament to be Dissolved: And yet in the same Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, and within three Lines, 'tis said expresly, that my Propositions were deliver'd to my <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>. Duke of Buckingham</hi> after that Parliament was Dissolved.
<q>
                           <p>So this Article hangs as well together as Mr. <hi>Bland's</hi> Testimony concerning it. Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> pressed this also hand against me; but I answered according to the Summ of that which is above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written. </p>
                        </q>
And as for the Particular said to be in that Paper, (were it mine, as it is not) or were the Words thought Treasonable, (as well they cannot be) yet the Statute of <hi>Queen Mary</hi> makes it, that no <note place="margin">
                           <hi>1</hi> Maria, c <hi>1. § 3.</hi>
                        </note> Words, nor Writings, nor Cipherings, nor Deeds, shall be Treason, but only such as are within the Statute of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. and no other. And this Statute I then read to the Lords, though I conceive there was no need of it.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth Proof was out of <hi>my Diary,</hi> at <hi>June</hi> 15. 1626. The <note place="margin">IV.</note> Words these: <hi>Post multas agitationes privata Malitia in Ducem</hi> Buckin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamiae <hi>superavit &amp; suffocavit omnia publica negotia; nihil actum est, sed Parliamentum solutum.</hi> And this was applied first by Mr. <hi>Nicolas,</hi> and after by Mr. <hi>Brown, as if I had charged this private Malice upon the Parliament.</hi> But this is utterly mistaken:
<q>
                           <p>For I spake not this of the Parliament, but of some few particular Men, some of the House, Men well enough known to the World;</p>
                        </q>
and more, not of the House, but Sticklers at large, who went between, and did very ill Offices, and so wronged both the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Parliament;</hi> which is no new thing in <hi>England.</hi> That my Words there cannot be meant of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, is two ways apparent. First, in that I say, <hi>Privata Malitia.</hi>
                        <pb n="404" facs="tcp:54614:214"/>
Private Malice did it; but name not the Parliament, nor charge any thing upon it. Secondly, Because had I spoken this of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it could not have been called <hi>Private,</hi> but <hi>Publick</hi> Malice; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being more publick in this Kingdom, than what is done in and by the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>The Fifth Proof was, <hi>That a Proclamation for calling in of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">V.</note> 
                        <hi>was found in my Study:</hi> And Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> said, <hi>they conceived I had a Hand in it.</hi> It was as lawful for me to have and keep this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, as for any other Subject. And their Conceit that I had a Hand in it, is no Proof. Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> says, <hi>That my Preferments fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed very quick upon this;</hi> and infers, <hi>that I was preferred for my ill Services in this kind.</hi> But all the Proof that he brings for this his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable Inference, <hi>is the comparing of the Times;</hi> and I shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be tried by that. For by his own acknowledgment this Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation came out <hi>June</hi> 16. 1622. I being then <hi>Bishop of S. Davids:</hi> And he confesses I was not made <hi>Bishop of Bath and Wells</hi> till <hi>June</hi> 20. 1626. full Four Years after; nor a Privy-Counsellor till <hi>April</hi> 29. 1627. which was Five Years after. Whereas Rewards for such Services are found to come much quicker.
<q>
                           <p>And Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi>  when he made his Summary Charge, slighted this, and passed it over.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Sixth Proof of my Enmity to Parliaments, <hi>was a Paper of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">VI.</note> 
                        <hi>Reasons,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> said, <hi>against Parliaments.</hi> But First, when this Paper was shewed and read to the Lords, it was found otherwise, and was but <hi>a Paper of Hopes and Fears, which were conceived of a Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament:</hi> Not Reasons against them. Secondly, these Fears and Hopes, were not of a Parliament then in being, but of one in deliberation, whether it should be or not at that time; which all Men know is often disputed, and without offence. And any considering Man may privately do it, for his own use and tryal of his Judgment. Thirdly, in this deliberation, I was not the Author of these <hi>Fears and Hopes,</hi> but an <hi>Amanuensis</hi> to higher Powers, in regard their Hands were slower; though Commanded also to set down my own Opinion, which I did. Fourthly, I was then either a Counsellor, or a Sworn Servant to <hi>the King,</hi> and required upon my Oath, to deliver truly, both my Fears and my Hopes; and I durst not Perjure my self. And I hope the keeping of my Oath, and doing my Duty in that kind, shall not now prejudice my Life. Fifthly, these <hi>Fears and Hopes</hi> what-ever they contain, did relate to the being or not being of that one Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment only, as appears in the very Paper it self; and the Hopes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, and that Parliament sate.
<q>
                           <p>And this Answer I gave to Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> who made all the use of this Paper that could be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst  me.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> brings in Mr. <hi>Bland</hi> again, who says, <hi>that the four last Heads in this Paper, were in that Paper also which was shewed him.</hi> This single Witness hath an Excellent Memory, that can remember four Heads of a Paper punctually Sixteen Years ago. I asked why he did not complain of me then, when his Memory was fresher, and his Witness Sir <hi>Sackvill Crowe</hi> nearer? 'Twas replyed, <hi>He durst not for my Greatness.</hi> Why, but he knows well enough, that Parliaments, when they have a just Cause of Proceeding, do neither fear nor spare
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:54614:214"/>
any Man's Greatness. And is it probable, that they which spared not <hi>the Duke of Buckingham's</hi> Greatness, would have feared mine, being then a poor <hi>Bishop of</hi> Bath <hi>and</hi> Wells? And a Parliament was held again in the very next Year, 1627. So that he wanted not opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to complain. Nor can I believe any Opinion of my supposed Greatness stopped him. Let him look into himself.</p>
                     <p>Then Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> told the Lords with great vehemency, what <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom</hi> there was in this Paper, which he said was in every Particular. A right Spider I see now he is, <hi>Venom</hi> out of any thing.
<q>
                           <p>Here is a void space left, I suppose with design to have the <hi>Paper</hi> (here mentioned) to be inserted. Which was not done.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Seventh Proof was out of <hi>my Diary at</hi> March, 1628. Where <note place="margin">VII.</note> the words are, <hi>that the Parliament which was dissolved</hi> March 10: 1628. <hi>sought my Ruin.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>This had been a better Argument to prove Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments  an Enemy to me, than me to them.</p>
                        </q>
But nothing can be meant by this, but that my <hi>Ruin</hi> was sought in that Parliament by some particular Men, whose Edge was too keen against me. And this appears in <hi>my Diary at</hi> June 14. preceeding; at which time I was put into a Remonstrance, which had I been found any way guilty, must needs have ruin'd me. But by God's Blessing, the very same day I did clearly acquit my self in open Parliament, of all the Aspersions cast upon me about Dr. <hi>Manwaring's</hi> Sermons.
<q>
                           <p>This Particular Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> charged upon me, and I Answer'd as before. But Mr. <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>  did not touch upon it this day.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Eighth Proof, that I was an Enemy to Parliaments, was <note place="margin">VIII.</note> taken from some Marginal Notes, which I had made upon a printed Speech of Sir <hi>Benjamin Rudyards,</hi> which he spake in the Parliament held <hi>An.</hi> 1627. Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> named Four; but Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> in Summing up my Charge, insisted only upon Two. The Word <hi>Reducing:</hi> And the <hi>Aim of Gaining from the King.</hi> Sir <hi>Benjamin Rudyard</hi> is my old Acquaintance, and a very worthy Member of that House, both now and then. But be a Man never so Worthy, may he not use some Phrase amiss? Or if he do, may not I or another observe, yea check at it, but by and by I must be an Enemy to Parliaments? Is there any Argument in this, I said a <hi>Gentleman</hi> in the House of Commons used an ill Phrase in a Speech of his in that House, therefore I am an Enemy to the Parliament in which he spake it? Say I am mistaken, and not he, and that the Phrase is without Exception; yet this is but my Error in Judgment, no Proof of Enmity, either to the Parliament, or him that spake it. That which I said was this. First, <hi>that the word</hi> Reducing, <hi>as there placed, was a hard Phrase.</hi> Let any Man view that Speech considerately, and tell me whether it be not so: Secondly, <hi>that I disliked the word</hi> Gaining, <hi>being between the King and his People in Parliament.</hi> For (as I humbly conceive) there will always be work enough for both to joyn for the Publick Good; and well it can never be, if they which should so joyn, do labour only to <hi>gain</hi> one from another. For if <hi>the King</hi> shall labour to <hi>gain</hi> upon the Liberty or Property of the Subject; or the Subjects in Parliament, labour to <hi>gain</hi> from the just Power and Prerogative of <hi>the King,</hi> can any
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:54614:215"/>
Prudent Man think the Publick can thrive there-while? Yea, but they say, <hi>that my Marginal Note upon this Phrase was, that this</hi> Gaining <hi>was the Aim of the lower House.</hi> If my Note be so, yet that cannot be otherwise understood, than that according to this Expression, this must be their <hi>Aim.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>And the Reason why I found fault with the Phrase was, because I saw this must follow out of it. So, under Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, </p>
                        </q>
I was not so bold with this Gentleman, as he was with the House in using this Speech.</p>
                     <p>The next Proof was, <hi>that I found fault with Eight Bills that were then</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">IX.</note> 
                        <hi>in the House.</hi> This is a very poor Proof of my Enmity to Parliaments, that I disliked some Bills proposed in them: Though there be no Proof of this urged at all, save only, <hi>that I writ the time</hi> May 27. 1628. <hi>upon the Paper where the Bills were mentioned.</hi> And I hope to mention the time when any <hi>Bills</hi> were proposed, is not to dislike the <hi>Bills.</hi> But say I did dislike them, what then? It is lawful for any Member of the House (and such was I then) to take Exceptions which he thinks are just against any <hi>Bill,</hi> before it pass. And shall not that which is Lawful for any Man to do, be Lawful for me? Beside, almost all <hi>Bills</hi> are put in by private Persons. The House is not interessed in them, till they are Passed and Voted by them: So that till then, any Man may spend his Judgment upon the <hi>Bill,</hi> without any wrong at all to the Parliament.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> saw this well enough, and therefore  vouchsafed not so much as to name it.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>The Tenth Proof was, <hi>that I made an Answer to the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">X.</note> 
                        <hi>set out by Parliament,</hi> An. 1628. This was pressed before, and here 'tis laid hold of on all Hands; to make as full a Cry as it can against me.
<q>
                           <p>Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> presses it here aloud (as he doth all  things) and Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> lays it close in Summing up the Charge.</p>
                        </q>
My Answer the same to both. First, they charge me, <hi>that I made</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1:</note> 
                        <hi>that Answer to the Remonstrance which came forth,</hi> An. 1628. I did this by <hi>the King's</hi> Command, and upon such Instructions as were given me. And as I obeyed the Command, so did I closely pursue my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions. And I durst do no other, for I was then upon my Oath as a Sworn Counsellor, and so employed in that Service. And I hope no Man will conceive, that I would without such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand have undertaken such a kind of Service. Yea, but they <note place="margin">2.</note> say, <hi>it doth not appear that I had any such Command:</hi> Yes, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears as plainly as that I made it. For they bring no Proof that I made it, but because the Indorsement upon that Paper is in my Hand, and calls it my Answer: And the same Indorsement says, I made it by <hi>his Majesty's</hi> Command. So either the Indorsement is no sufficient Proof for the one, or if it be, 'tis sufficient for both; And must needs witness the one for me, with the same strength that it doth the other against me. For a kind of Confession that Indorsement is, and must therefore not be broken, but be taken with all its Qualities. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">3.</note> they say, <hi>there are some sour and bitter Passages in the Answer.</hi> 'Tis more than I perceived, if it be so. Nor was any Sourness intended. And I hope no such Passages found in it, the Person con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, in whose Name the Answer was made. The Expressions indeed might have been too big for a Subject's Mouth. Fourthly, they <note place="margin">4:</note> say, <hi>I was displeased that this Answer was not Printed;</hi> but all the Proof
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:54614:215"/>
they brought for it is, <hi>that it is written upon the Paper, that there was an Intention to Print it, but that I know not what hinder'd it.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>But this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument can never conclude: <hi>John a Nokes</hi> knows not who hindred the Printing of a Jewish <hi>Catechism in</hi> England; therefore he was displeased the Catechism was not Printed. But I see every Foot  can help trample him that is down.</p>
                        </q>
Yea, but <hi>they Instanced in three Particulars,</hi> which they charged severally upon me. The first Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <note place="margin">1.</note> was, <hi>That by this Remonstrance, they sought to fill our Peoples Hearts more than our Ears.</hi> A second was, <hi>that they swelled to that big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                        <hi>till they brake themselves.</hi> But neither of these strike at any Right or Priviledge of Parliaments; they only Tax some Abuses, which were conceived to be in the Miscarriage of that one Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And both these Particulars were in my Instructions. And though I have ever Honoured Parliaments, and ever shall, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think them Infallible. <hi>General Councils</hi> have greater Promises than they, yet they may Err.
<q>
                           <p>And when a Parliament, by what ill Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent so-ever, comes to Err, may not their <hi>King</hi> tell them of it? Or  must every Passage in his Answer be sour, that pleases not?</p>
                        </q>
And for that <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> whither it tended let the World judge, the Office is too dangerous for me. The third Particular, <hi>was the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing</hi>

                        <hi>of</hi> Ireland, <hi>and the growth of</hi> Popery <hi>there, of which that Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance,</hi> An. 1628. <hi>complained.</hi> This was in the Instructions too. And I had Reason to think, the <hi>King</hi> and his Council understood the State of <hi>Ireland,</hi> for Religion and other Affairs, as well as other Men. And I was the more easily led into the belief, that Religion was much at one State in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in <hi>Queen Elizabeth's</hi> and <hi>King James</hi> his time, and now; because ever since I understood any thing of those <hi>Irish</hi> Affairs, I still heard the same Complaints that were now made. For in all these times they had their <hi>Romish</hi> Hierarchy: Submitted to their Government: Payed them Tythes: Came not to the <hi>Protestant</hi> Churches: And Rebelled under <hi>Tyrone</hi> under pretence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And I do not conceive they have gone beyond this now.
<q>
                           <p>If they have, let them Answer it, who have occasioned it.</p>
                        </q>
But to prove this great new growth of <hi>Popery</hi> there, they produced, first <hi>a Proclamation from the</hi> State <hi>in</hi> Ireland, <hi>dated</hi> April 1. 1629. Then a <hi>Letter of the Bishop of</hi> Kilmore's <hi>to my self, dated</hi> April 1. 1630. Thirdly, <hi>a Complaint made to the</hi> State <hi>there,</hi> An. 1633. <hi>of this growth, so that I could not but know it.</hi> Most true, when these Informations came I could not but know it: But look upon their Date, and you shall find that all of them came after this <hi>Answer</hi> was made to the <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance,</hi> and therefore could not possibly be foreseen by me, without the Gift of Prophesie. Then they produced <hi>a Letter of the Earl of</hi> Straffords, <hi>in which he Communicated to me,</hi> Mar. 1633. <hi>that to mould the Lower House there, and to rule them the better, he had got them to be chosen of an equal number of Protestants and Papists.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>And here Mr. <hi>Maynard,</hi> who pressed this point of Religion hard upon me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fall foul upon this Policy of <hi>the Earl of</hi> Strafford, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self  yet brake off with this, <hi>But he is gone.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </q>
Then he fell upon me as a Man likely to approve those ways, because he desired the Letter might be communicated to me. This Letter was not written to me, as appears by the Charge it self: For if it had, no Man else
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:54614:216"/>
needed to communicate it to me. And I would fain know, how I could help any of this? If that Lord would write any thing to me himself, or communicate any thing to another that should acquaint me with it, was it in my power to hinder either of these? And there were other Passages in this Letter, for which, I conceive, his Lordship de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired the Communication of that Letter to me, much more than the Particular urged, which could no way relate unto me.
<q>
                           <p>And Mr. <hi>Brown</hi>  in his Summ said very little, if any thing, to this Business of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this Mr. <hi>Nicolas,</hi> who would have nothing forgotten, that <note place="margin">XI.</note> might help to multiply Clamour against me, fell upon five Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which he did but name, and left the Lords to their Notes. Four of these Five were handled before. As First, the words, <hi>If the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament prove peevish.</hi> Secondly, <hi>that the King might use his own Power.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>the violation of the Petition of Right.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>the Canons.</hi> Fifthly, <hi>that I set Spyes about the Election of Parliament-Men in</hi> Glocester-shire; <hi>and for this last, they produced a Letter of one</hi> Allibon <hi>to Dr.</hi> Heylin. To the four first, I referred the Lords to their Notes of my Answers, as they did. To this last, that Mr. <hi>Allibon</hi> is a meer Stranger to me, I know not the Man. And 'tis not likely I should employ a Stranger in such a Business. The Letter was sent to Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> and if there were any discovery in it of Juglings there in those Elections, (as too often there are;) and if Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> sent me those Letters, as desirous I should see what Practices are abroad; what fault is there in him or me for this?</p>
                     <p>Then Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> would not omit that which he thought <note place="margin">XII.</note> might disgrace and discontent me, though it could no way be drawn to be any Accusation: 'Twas out of <hi>my Diary, at</hi> Oct: 27. 1640. this Parliament being then ready to begin. The Passage there is, <hi>That going into my upper Study to send away some Manuscripts to</hi> Oxford, <hi>I found my Picture which hung there privately, fallen down upon the Face, and lying on the Floor; I am almost every day threatned with my Ruin, God grant this be no Omen of it.</hi> The Accident is true; and having so many Libels causelesly thrown out against me; and hearing so many ways as I did, that my Ruin was Plotted, I had Reason to apprehend it. But I apprehended it without Passion, and with looking up to God, that it might not be Ominous to me.
<q>
                           <p>What is this Man Angry at?  Or why is this produced?</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But though I cannot tell why this was produced, yet the next <note place="margin">XIII.</note> was urged only to Incense your Lordships against me: <hi>'Tis in</hi> my Diary again, at <hi>Feb.</hi> 11. 1640. Where Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> says confidently I did Abuse your Lordships, and Accuse you of Injustice. <hi>My Lords,</hi> what I said in my <hi>Diary</hi> appears not; if it did appear whole and altogether, I doubt not but it alone would abundantly satisfie your Lordships. But that Passage is more than half burnt out (as is <note n="*" place="margin">It was view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> to be seen) whether of purpose by Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> or casually, I cannot tell; yet the Passage as confidently made up, and read to your Lordships, as if nothing were wanting. For the thing it self, the close of my words is this: <hi>So I see what Justice I may expect, since here's a Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on taken, not only before my Answer, but before my Charge is brought up against me.</hi> Which Words can traduce no Man's Justice. First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they depend upon an <hi>If:</hi> If the Parliament-Man there mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:54614:216" rendition="simple:additions"/>
told me Truth, that such a Resolution was taken. And Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, because it can be no Justice in any Men, be the Sentence never so moderate in it self, to take up a Resolution what Sentence shall pass, before Answer given, or Charge put in: For else a Man may be punished first, and tryed after, which is contrary <note n="*" place="margin">Potentia sequi debet Justitiam, non praeire, Aug. L. <hi>13.</hi> de Trin, c. <hi>13.</hi>
                        </note> to all Rules of Justice. And therefore if such a Resolution were taken (as I believe not) I might well say that which followed after.</p>
                     <p>Then was produced <hi>a Paper concerning the Subsidies or Aids</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">XIV.</note> 
                        <hi>which had been given in divers Parliaments, in which it is said, at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it, that</hi> Magna Charta <hi>had an obscure Birth, and was Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered by an Ill Nurse.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>I believe that no Man that knows Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas,</hi>  thinks that he spakes softly upon this.</p>
                        </q>
No, he spake loud enough; What Laws would I spare, that spake thus of <hi>Magna Charta?</hi> First, here is no Proof offered that this Paper is my Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, but only that it is in my Hand: By which Argument (as is said before) I may be made the Author of any thing: And so may any Scholar that is able and willing to inform himself. Secondly, the main Draught of that Paper is not in my Hand, though some Notes upon it be. Thirdly, there are <hi>Littleton,</hi> and other Lawyers quoted in that Paper, Authors which I never read. Nor is this now any disgrace to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> that it had an obscure Birth: For say the Difficulties of the times brought it obscurely forth; that's no blemish to the Credit and Honour to which it hath for many Ages attained. Not only their Laws, but the greatest Empires that have been in the World, some of them have had obscure beginnings. Witness the <hi>Roman Empire.</hi> Fourthly, what if our Stories agree upon it, that it had an obscure Birth, and a worse Nurse? What if some Law Books (which Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> never read) and those of good account, use almost the same Words of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which are in that Paper? Shall the same Words be History and Law in them, and Treason in me? And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what <note place="margin">Here is a void space left in the Margin, with design (I suppose) to insert therein some Passages out of Law-Books concerning the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure Birth of <hi>Margna Charta:</hi> Which space was not filled up. <hi>H:</hi>
                        </note> certainly there is in it,
<q>
                           <p>that Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> when he gave his Summary Charge against me, First to <hi>the Lords,</hi> and after in <hi>the House of Commons,</hi> quite omitted this Particular. Sure I believe he found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was in the Paper, but known Truth, and so passed it over, else he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have denyed a Vindicaton to <hi>Magna  Charta.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>After all this Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> concludes with a Dream, which he <note place="margin">XV.</note> says was mine. <hi>The Dream</hi> (he says) <hi>was, that I should come to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Preferment in the Church, and Power in the State, than any Man of my Birth and Calling had done before me, but that in the end I should be Hanged.</hi> First, <hi>my Lords,</hi> if I had had any such Dream, 'tis no Proof of any thing against me. Dreams are not in the Power of him that hath them, but in the unruliness of the Phansie, which in broken sleeps <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Num.</hi> 11.</note> wanders which way it pleases, and shapes what it pleaseth. But this Dream is brought in as the Fall of my Picture was, to make me a Scorn to your Lordships and the People. And to try whether any
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:54614:217"/>
thing will yet at last break my Patience. This Dream is Reported here according to Mr. <hi>Pryn's</hi> Edition of my Diary, somewhat diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that which Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> Printed in a former Book of his; but the beginning and the end agree. From Mr. <hi>Pryn, Culmer</hi> hath taken and Printed it. And Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> confessed before the Lords, that one Mr. <hi>Badger</hi> an Attorney at Law, a Kinsman of mine, told it him. The Truth, <hi>my Lords,</hi> is this. This <hi>Badger</hi> Married a near Kinswo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of mine; he was a notorious Separatist, and so nearer in Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> than to me in Alliance. This Man came one day to me to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and told me privately (which was more Manners than usually the Bold Man had) that he heard I had such a Dream when I was Young, in <hi>Oxford:</hi> I protested to him there was no such thing, and that some Malicious Fellow or other had set him on work to come and Abuse me to my Face. He seemed satisfied; but going to Visit Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> then in the Tower, he told it him; and Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> without further Proof, Prints it in the next Book he set out. When I saw it in Print, and found that some in Court took notice of it, I resolved to acquaint <hi>his Majesty</hi> how I was used; and meeting with the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> then Lord Chamberlain, and my great Friend as he pretended (the <hi>King</hi> being not then come forth of his Chamber) I told his Lordship how I was used; and when <hi>the King</hi> came forth I told it him also. But the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> then present in the House, and called up by them for a Witness, forgetting the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, but remembring the thing, took it <hi>upon his Honour,</hi> that I said nothing of Mr. <hi>Pryn's</hi> Printing it, but that I told him abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely I had this Dream. Now God forgive his Lordship. I was much troubled in my self to hear him take it <hi>upon his Dishonour,</hi> (for so it was) and yet unwilling (knowing his Violence) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test with him in that place, and in my Condition; and observing what Spleen he hath lately shewed against me, I stood a little still to gather up my self. When Mr. <hi>Nicolas,</hi> before I could make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, fell on with great earnestness, <hi>and told the Lords, that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of my Dream was found true, to the great hurt both of Church and State; and that he hoped they would now make good the latter: That I might be Hanged.</hi> To which I Answer'd, That I had not forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten our Saviour's Prediction, St. <hi>John</hi> 16. <hi>That in the World we should</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">St. John <hi>16.33.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>be sure to meet with affliction.</hi> Nor his Prayer: <hi>Father forgive these Men, for they know not what they do, St.</hi> Luke 23. No, nor is that out of my <note place="margin">St. Luke <hi>23. 34. 1</hi> Cor. <hi>4. 3.</hi>
                        </note> Memory which St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>De Humano Die.</hi> But for the Publick, with this I shall conclude. God of his Infinite Mercy Bless <hi>the King</hi> and his People with Love, and Peace, and Piety, and Plenty, which is the worst I ever wished or endeavoured, whatsoever it shall please God shall become of me, to whose Blessed Will and Pleasure, in all Humility I submit my self. And here ended this last day of my Tryal. But before I went from the Bar, I made three Motions to <hi>the Lords:</hi> The one, That I might have a day to make a Recapitulation of this long and various Charge, or of the chief Heads of it, that it might appear in a Body together. The other, That after this, my <hi>Councel</hi> might have a day to speak to all Points of Law, incident to my Cause. The third, That they would be pleased to remember that I had pleaded the <hi>Act of Oblivion</hi>
                        <pb n="411" facs="tcp:54614:217"/>
to the Thirteenth Original Article. Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> said, they would acquaint their House with it. And <hi>the Lords</hi> promised to take all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Consideration. And so I was dismissed <hi>Sine Die.</hi>
                        <q>
                           <p>But here I may not go off from this Dream so, since Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> hath Printed it at the end of <hi>my Diary.</hi> Where he shamelesly says, <hi>This Dream was Attested from my own Mouth, at my Tryal in the Lords House.</hi> For I have set down all that pass'd exactly. Nor did I then give any Attestation to it; only before I could gather up my self, to Answer the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> in a fitting manner, and not to hurt my self, Mr. <hi>Nicolas</hi> fell upon me with that Unchristian bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness, as diverted me from the <hi>Earl,</hi> to Answer him. But once for all, and to satisfie any Man that desires it, That is all true which I have here set down concerning this Dream, and <hi>upon my Christianity</hi> and hope of future Salvation, I never had this Dream nor any like it, nor did I ever tell it this Lord, or any other, any other way, than in Relation to <hi>Badger</hi> and <hi>Pryn,</hi> as is before related. And surely if I had had such a Dream, I should not have had so little Discretion, as to tell it any Man, least of all, to pour it into that <hi>Sieve the Earl of</hi> Pembroke. For that which follows, and wherein his Charity and Words are almost the same with those of Mr. <hi>Nicolas,</hi> I give him the same Answer, and (forgiving him all his most Unchristian and Insatiable Malice against me) leave my self  in the Hands of God, not in his.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I Received an Order from <hi>the Lords,</hi> that if I had a mind to make a <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aug.</hi> 23.1644.</note> Recapitulation (as I had formerly desired) of my long and various Charge, I should provide my self for it against <hi>Munday</hi> next (this Order came upon <hi>Friday</hi>) and that I should give in my Answer the next Morning what I meant to do. The next day, in Obedience to <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aug.</hi> 24.</note> this Order, I gave in my Answer; which was, Humble Thanks that I might have liberty to make it, referring the day to their Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Consideration; with this, that <hi>Munday</hi> next was a very short time for such a Collection. Upon this Answer, an Order was presently made, that I should provide to make my Recapitulation upon <hi>Munday September</hi> the Second. And about this time, (the certain day I know not) it was Resolved in the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> that according to my Plea I should enjoy the benefit of the <hi>Act of Oblivion,</hi> and not be put to Answer the Thirteenth Original <hi>Article,</hi> concerning the <hi>Scottish Business.</hi> And truly, I bless God for it, I did not desire the benefit of that Act, for any Sense of Guiltiness which I had in my self; but, in Consideration of the Times, and the Malice of the now Potent Faction, which being implacable towards me, I could not think it Wisdom, to lay by any such Power as might help to secure me. Yet in the former part of this <hi>History,</hi> when I had good Reason to think I should not be called to Answer such <hi>General Articles,</hi> I have set down my Answer to each of them, as much as <hi>Generals</hi> can be Answer'd. And thereby I hope my Innocency will appear to this Thirteenth <hi>Article</hi> also.</p>
                     <p>Then came <hi>Munday, Sept.</hi> 2. and, according to the Order of <hi>the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>September</hi> 2. 1644.</note> 
                        <hi>Lords,</hi> I made the Recapitulation of my whole Cause, in matters of greatest Moment, in this form following. But so soon as I came to the Bar, I saw every Lord present with a New Thin Book <hi>in Folio</hi>
                        <pb n="412" facs="tcp:54614:218"/>
in a blue Coat. I heard that Morning that Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> had Printed my <hi>Diary,</hi> and Published it to the World to disgrace me. Some Notes of his own are made upon it. The first and the last are two desperate Untruths, beside some others. This was the Book then in <hi>the Lords</hi> Hands, and I assure my self, that time picked for it, that the sight of it might damp me, and disinable me to speak: I confess I was a little troubled at it. But after I had gathered up my self, and looked up to God, I went on to the Business of the Day, and thus I spake.</p>

                           <hi>Mr. Lords,</hi> my Hearing began <hi>March</hi> 12. 1643/4. and continued to the end of <hi>July.</hi> In this time I was heard before <hi>your Lordships,</hi> with much Honour and Patience, Twenty Days; and sent back without Hearing, by reason of <hi>your Lordships</hi> greater Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, Twelve Days. The rest were taken up with providing the Charge against me.</p>
                        <p>And now, <hi>my Lords,</hi> being come near an end, I am, by your Grace and Favour, and the leave of these Gentlemen of the <hi>Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable House of Commons,</hi> to represent to <hi>your Lordships</hi> and your Memories, a brief Summ of my Answers to this long and various Charge: In which I shall not only endeavour, but perform also all possible Brevity. And as with much Thankfulness I acknowledge my self bound to <hi>your Lordships</hi> for your Patience: So I cannot doubt, but that I shall be as much obliged for your Justice, in what I am innocent from Crime; and for your Clemency, in what the common Frailty of Mankind hath made me Err. And I Humbly desire <hi>your Lordships,</hi> to look upon the whole Business with Honourable Care of my Calling; of my Age; of my long Imprisonment; of my Sufferings in my Estate; and of my Patience in and through this whole Affliction: The Sequestration having been upon my Estate above Two Years. In which notwithstanding, I may not omit to give Thanks for the Relief which my Petitions found, for my present ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities in this time of my Hearing, at your Honourable Hands.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. First then, I humbly desire <hi>your Lordships</hi> to remember the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and by occasion of that, the incertainty of almost every Article charged upon me, which hath cast me into great streights all along in making my Defence.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Next, That <hi>your Lordships</hi> will be pleased to consider, what a
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:54614:218"/>
short space, upon each Days Hearing, hath been allowed me to make my Answer, to the many Charges in each several Day laid against me. Indeed, some Days scarce time enough to peruse the Evidence, much less to make, and then to review and weigh my Answers. Especially considering (to my greatest Grief) that such a Charge should be brought up against me, from so Great and Honourable a Body as <hi>the Commons of England.</hi> In regard of which, and all other sad Occasions, I at first did, and do still in all Humility desire, that in all Particulars concerning Law, my <hi>Councel</hi> may be heard before <hi>your Lordships</hi> proceed to Sentence, and that a Day may be assigned for my <hi>Councel</hi> accordingly.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Thirdly, I heartily pray also, that it may be taken into your Honourable Consideration, how I have all manner of ways been sift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the very Bran, for that (what e're it amounts to) which stands in Charge against me.</p>
                        <p n="1">(1) The Key and use of my Study at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> Books and Papers taken from me.</p>
                        <p n="2">(2) A Search upon me at the <hi>Tower,</hi> made by Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> and One and Twenty Bundles of Papers, prepared for my Defence, taken from me, and not Three Bundles restored to me again. This Search made before any Particular Articles were brought up against me. My very Pockets searched; and my <hi>Diary,</hi> nay, my very <hi>Prayer-Book</hi> taken from me, and after used against me: And that in some Cases, not to prove, but to make a Charge: Yet I am thus far glad, even for this sad Accident. For by <hi>my Diary</hi> your Lordships have seen the Passages of my Life: And by my <hi>Prayer-Book</hi> the greatest Secrets between God and my Soul: So that you may be sure you have me at the very bottom: Yet blessed be God, no Disloyalty is found in the one; no Popery in the other.</p>
                        <p n="3">(3) That all Books of <hi>Council-Table, Star-Chamber, High-Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Signet-Office, my own Registeries, and the Registeries of</hi> Oxford <hi>and</hi> Cambridge, have been most exquisitely searched for matter against me, and kept from me and my use, and so affording me no help towards my Defence.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. I humbly desire your Lordships to remember in the Fourth Place, That the things wherein I took great Pains, and all for the Publick Good and Honour of this Kingdom and Church, without any the least Eye to my own Particular, nay, with my own great and large Expences, have been objected against me as Crimes. As namely, the <hi>Repair of S.</hi> Pauls, <hi>and the Setling of the Statutes of the Vniversity of</hi> Oxford.</p>
                        <p n="1">(1) For S. <hi>Pauls,</hi> not the Repair it self, they say (no, for very shame they dare not say that, though that be it which Galls the Faction) but the Demolishing of the Houses which stood about it. Yea, but without taking down of these Houses, it was not possible to come at the Church to repair it, which is a known Truth. And they were taken down by Commission under the <hi>Broad Seal.</hi> And the Tenants had Valuable Consideration for their several Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests, according to the number of their Years remaining: And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Judgment of Commissioners named for that purpose, and named by <hi>his Majesty</hi> and the Lords, not by me. Nor did I
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:54614:219"/>
ever so much as sit with them about this Business. And if the Commission it self were any way Illegal (as they urge it is) that must reflect upon them, whose Office was to Draw and Seal it; not on me, who understood not the Legality or Illegality of such Commissions; nor did I desire that any one circumstance against Law should be put into it, nor is any such thing so much as offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Proof against me. And because it was pressed, <hi>that these Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses could not be pulled down but by Order of Parliament, and not by the King's Commission alone:</hi> I did here first read in part, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, according to a <hi>Salvo</hi> granted me, deliver into the Court Three Records, two in <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. Time, and one in <note n="*" place="margin">

And a little after, <hi>Quousque per nos cum deliberatione &amp; avisamento nostri Consilii super hoc aliter fuerit Ordinatum,</hi> &amp;c. Here's no staying for a Parliament; here's no Recompence given; here's Barring of all Appeal, nay all remedy of Law, though written. And all this by <hi>the King's</hi> own Authority, with the Advice of his Council. And is a far more moderate way taken by me, yet under the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and for the removal of far greater Abuses, and for a more noble End, become Treason?</p>
                        <p n="2">(2) As for <hi>the Statutes of Oxford,</hi> the Circumstances charged against me are many, and therefore I craved leave to refer my self to what I had already answered therein.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Fifthly, Many of the Witnesses brought against me in this Business are more than suspected <hi>Sectaries</hi> and <hi>Separatists</hi> from the Church, which by my place I was to punish, and that exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated them against me, whereas by <note n="†" place="margin">Cod.

At which pre-examination I was not present, nor any for me, to cross-interrogate. Nay, many Causes which took up divers Days of Hearing <hi>in Star-Chamber, High-Commission, and at Council-Table,</hi> are now upon the sudden easily overthrown, by the Depositions of the Parties themselves. And upon what Law this is grounded, I humbly submit to your Lordships. And such as these, are the Causes of Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> Alderman <hi>Chambers,</hi> Mr. <hi>Vassal,</hi> Mr. <hi>Waker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Huntly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Foxlye,</hi> and many other. Where I humbly represent also, how impossible it is for any Man, that sits as a Judge, to give an account of all the several Motives which directed his Conscience in so divers Causes, and so many Years past, as these have been; and where so many Witnesses have been Examined, as have been here produced against me: <hi>My Lords,</hi> above a Hundred and Fifty Witnesses, and some of them, Three, Four, Six Times over, and Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> I know not how often.

                           <hi>which so do, distrust the truth and goodness of their Cause.</hi> Besides, <hi>my Lords,</hi> in all matters which came before me, I have done nothing to the uttermost of my Understanding, but what might conduce to the Peace and Welfare of this Kingdom, and the maintenance of the Doctrine and Discipline of this Church established by Law; and under which God hath blessed this State, with so great Peace and Plenty, as other Neighbouring Nations have looked upon with Admiration. And what Miseries the overthrow of it (which God in Mercy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid) may produce, he alone knows.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Sixthly, <hi>my Lords,</hi> there have been many and different Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges laid upon me about Words. But many of them (if spoken) were only passionate, and hasty: And such, upon what occasion soever drawn from me (and I have had all manner of Provocations put upon me) may among humane Errours, be pardoned unto me, if so it please <hi>your Lordships.</hi> But for such as may seem to be of a higher Nature, as those witnessed by Sir <hi>Henry Vane the Elder,</hi> I gave my Answer again now fully to <hi>the Lords,</hi> but shall not need to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it here.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Then, <hi>my Lords,</hi> for my Actions; not only my own, but other Mens have been heavily Charged against me in many Particulars, and that Criminally, and I hope <hi>your Lordships</hi> will think Illegally. <hi>As Secretary</hi> Windebank's, <hi>Bishop</hi> Montague's, <hi>my Chaplains, Dr.</hi> Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyn's, <hi>Dr.</hi> Cosens, <hi>Dr.</hi> Pocklinton's, <hi>Dr.</hi> Dove's, <hi>Mr.</hi> Shelford's, and divers others: And many of these Charges look back into many Years past. Whereas the <hi>Act</hi> made this present Parliament, takes no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, nor punishes any Man, for any thing done and past at <hi>the Council-Table, Sar-Chamber, or High-Commission;</hi> much less doth it make any thing Treason. And out of this <hi>Act</hi> I am no way Except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Besides, (as I have often Pleaded) all Acts done in in the <hi>Star-Chamber, at Council-Table, High Commission, or Convocation;</hi> are all Joynt Acts of that Body, in and by which they were done; and cannot by any Law be singly put upon me, it being a known Rule of the Law, <hi>Refertur ad universos quod publice fit per Majorem Partem.</hi> And <note n="*" place="margin">

And in some of these Courts, <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> especially, and <hi>Council-Table,</hi> I was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with Persons of great Honour, Knowledge and Experience, Judges, and others; and 'tis to me strange, and will seem so to Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Ages, that one and the same Act shall be <hi>Treason</hi> in me, and not the least <hi>Crime,</hi> nay, nor <hi>Misdemeanour</hi> in any other.

The Industry used in the Framing thereof, and every and the least part thereof, the curious Workmanship thereon bestowed, the exceeding Charge and Expence in the Provisions, the Dutiful Observance in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and preserving the Holy Vessels, the Solemn removing thereof, the Vigilant Attendance thereon, and the Provident De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the same, which <hi>All Ages</hi> have in some Degree imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is now so forgotten and cast away in this superfine Age, by those of the <hi>Family,</hi> by <hi>the Anabaptists, Brownists, and other Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi> as all Cost and Care bestowed and had of the Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God is to be Served and Worshipped, is accounted a kind of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and as proceeding from an Idolatrous Disposition. Insomuch as Time would soon bring to pass (if it were not resisted) that God would be turned out of Churches into Barns, and from thence again into the Fields and Mountains, and under the Hedges; and the Office of the Ministery (robbed of all Dignity and respect) be as contemptible as those Places; all Order, Discipline and Church Government, left to newness of Opinion and Mens Fancies: Yea, and soon after as many kinds of Religions would spring up, as there  are Parish-Churches, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>But, <hi>my Lords,</hi> there are other strange Arguments produced against me, to prove my Compliance with <hi>Rome,</hi> which I most humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire your Lordships may not be forgotten.</p>
                        <p n="1">1.

Whence the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument drawn against me must be this, and can be no other: That I did endeavour: to bring in <hi>Popery,</hi> because I made and took a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Oath, never to give my Consent to subject this <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to the Usurpations and Superstitions of the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> I beseech <hi>your Lordships</hi> mark the force of this Argument: And they which follow are as pregnant against me.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>My Book against</hi> Fisher hath been charged against me; where the Argument must lie thus: I have endeavoured to advance <hi>Popery,</hi> because I have written against it: And with what strength I have written, I leave to Posterity to judge, when the Envy which now over-loads me, shall be buried with me. This I will say with St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> (whose Success at <hi>Constantinople</hi> was not much unlike mine here, save that his Life was not sought) <hi>I</hi>

[And let <hi>the Church of England</hi> look to it; for in great Humility I crave to write this (though then was no time to speak it) That <hi>the Church of England</hi> must leave the way it's now going, and come back to that way of Defence which I have followed in my Book, or She shall never be able to justifie Her Separation from <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome.]</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>All the late Canons</hi> have been charged against me; and the Argument which is drawn from thence, must lie thus: The Third of these <hi>Canons</hi> for suppressing the Growth of <hi>Popery,</hi> is the most full and strict <hi>Canon</hi> that ever was made against it in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> Therefore I that made this <hi>Canon</hi> to keep it out, am guilty of endeavouring to bring it in.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Fourthly, I have by my Industry, and God's great Blessing upon my Labours, stayed as many from going, and reduced to <hi>the Church of England</hi> as many that were gone to <hi>Rome,</hi> as I believe any Minister in <hi>England</hi> can truly say he hath done: I named them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and had Scorn enough put upon me for it, as <hi>your Lordships</hi> could not but both see and hear; where the Argument lies thus: I converted many from <hi>Popery,</hi> and setled them in the Religion established in <hi>England:</hi> Therefore I laboured to bring in <hi>Popery;</hi> which out of all doubt can be no sober Man's way.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Fifthly, The Plot discovered to Sir <hi>William Boswell</hi> and my self, by <hi>Andreas ab Habernfield,</hi> hath been charged against me: That Plot for altering of Religion, and by what ways, <hi>your Lordships</hi> have
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:54614:221"/>
heard already, and is to be seen at full in <hi>Rome's Master-piece.</hi> Now <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Pryn's Rome's</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-piece.</note> if this Plot in the Issue proved nothing but a confused Information, and no Proof of any Particular, as indeed it did; What's become of <hi>Rome's Master-piece?</hi> But if it had any reality in it, as it appeared to be a sad Plot, not only to me, but to all Men that saw the short Propositions which were first sent, with an absolute Undertaking to prove them; then it appears expresly, that I was in danger of my Life, for stiffly opposing the bringing in of <hi>Popery;</hi> and that there was no hope to alter Religion in <hi>England,</hi> 'till I was taken out of the way. And though in conclusion the Proofs failed, yet what was consulted, and it seems resolved concerning me, is plain enough. And then the Argument against me lies thus: There's no hope to bring in <hi>Popery,</hi> 'till I am taken out of the way; therefore I did labour to bring it in. Do not these things, <hi>my Lords,</hi> hang hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly together?</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Lastly, There have been above Threescore Letters and other Papers, brought out of my Study into this Honourable House; they are all about composing the Differences between <hi>the Lutherans and the Calvinists in Germany.</hi> Why they should be brought hither, but in hope to charge them upon me, I know not; and then the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument will be this: I laboured to reconcile the <hi>Protestants</hi> in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> that they might unanimously set themselves against the <hi>Papists;</hi> therefore I laboured to bring <hi>Popery</hi> into <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now that <hi>your Lordships</hi> have heard the Arguments, and what Proof they make against me, I must be bold to put you in Mind of that which was said here at the Barr, <hi>April</hi> 16. 1644. That <hi>they did not urge any of these particular Actions as Treason against me; but the Result of them all together amounted to Treason.</hi> For answer to which, I must be bold to tell <hi>your Lordships,</hi> That if no Particular which is charged upon me be Treason, the Result from them cannot be Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which will appear by these Reasons following:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. First, <hi>The Result</hi> must be of the same Nature and Species with the Particulars from which it rises. But 'tis confessed no one of the Particulars are Treason: Therefore neither is the Result that rises from them. And this holds in <hi>Nature,</hi> in <hi>Morality,</hi> and in <hi>Law.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In <hi>Nature,</hi> and that both for Integral and Essential Parts; for neither can the Body of a Bear, and the Soul of a Lion result into a Fox; nor the Legs of a Bull, the Body of a Horse, and the Head of an Ass, result into a Man.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Morality,</hi> and that is seen both in Vertues and Vices: For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can many Actions of Liberality, Meekness and Sobriety, rise up into a Result of Fortitude; neither can many Actions of Malice, Drunkenness and Covetousness, result into Treason.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Law</hi> 'tis so too: For be there never so many particular Crimes, yet there is no Law in this Kingdom, nor any where else that I know, that makes a Result of different Crimes to be Treason, where none of the Particulars are Treason by Law. So this imaginary Result is a Monster in Nature, in Morality, and in Law; and if it be nourished, will devour all the Safety of the Subject of <hi>England,</hi> which now stands so well fenced by the known Law of the Land.
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:54614:222"/>
And therefore I humbly desire <hi>your Lordships,</hi> not for mine, but for the Publick's sake, to weigh this Business well, before this Gap be made so wide, as there will hardly be Power left again to shut it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. My Second Reason is joined to the Answer of an Objection: For when this Result was spoken of, it was added, That the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars charged against me, are of the same kind, and do all tend to the Subversion of Law and Religion, and so become Treason. But, first, suppose that all the Particulars charged do tend to the subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Law, yet that cannot make them to be all of one kind: For all Crimes tend more or less to the Overthrow of Vertue; yet no Man can say, that all Crimes are of the same kind. Secondly, be they of the same, or different kinds; yet neither all, nor any of these charged against me, do tend to the subversion of the Law: For 'tis one thing to <hi>break, dislike, or speak against</hi> some particular Laws, and quite another to labour the Subversion of the whole Body of the Law and the Frame of Government. And that I have done this by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy, or Force, or any overt Action, is not so much as offered in proof. And for the breach of any particular Law, if I be guilty, I am to be punished by the Sanction of that Law which I have broken.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Whereas it hath been said, <hi>That many Actions of the same kind make a Habit.</hi> That's true. But what then? For first, the Actions urged against me, are not of the same kind, but exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing different. Secondly, if the Habit be Treasonable, then all those particular Actions which bred that Habit, must be several Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as well as the Result or Habit it self; whereas it hath been granted all along, that my particular Actions are not Treasons. And, thirdly, a Habit in it self, neither is nor can be Treason; for all Treason is either <hi>Thought, Word, or Overt Act;</hi> but no Habit is either of these: Therefore not Treason.

So an ill Habit against Soveraign Power, may make a Man apt and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to fall into Treason; but Treason it is not.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Fourthly, Nor can this Result be Treason at the <hi>Common Law,</hi> by which alone, I conceive, there is no Treason at all at this day in <hi>England:</hi> For the main end of that excellent <hi>Statute</hi> of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. was for the Safety of the Subject, against the manifold Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which variously fell upon them by the Common Law, and bounded all Treasons, and limited them to the things expressed to be Treason in and by that Statute. And in all times of difficulty since, recourse hath still been had to that <hi>Statute.</hi> And to that <hi>Statute</hi> I refer my self, with this: That this Result must be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within this <hi>Statute,</hi> or some other known Statute, or else it cannot be Treason. And no Proof at all hath been so much as offered, that this Result is Treason by any Law.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>My Lords,</hi> I do with all humble submission desire, That when the Reply is made to this matter of Fact, a Day may be assigned for my <hi>Councel</hi> to be heard in matter of Law, in all and every Particular which they shall find necessary for my just Defence.</p>

                           <pb n="421" facs="tcp:54614:222" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And now, <hi>my Lords,</hi> I do in all Humility lay my self low at God's Mercy-seat, to do with me as he pleases; and, under God, I shall rely upon <hi>your Lordships</hi> Justice, Honour and Clemency, of which I cannot doubt.

                     <p>This day my <hi>Councel,</hi> according as they were Ordered, delivered into <hi>the Lords</hi> House, these two Points following, by way of Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

Secondly, Whether the Charge of the said Impeachment <note place="margin">II.</note> and Articles, did contain such Certainty and Particularity, as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by Law, in a Case where Treason is charged? This day I Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned <hi>the Lords,</hi> that my <hi>Councel</hi> might have access to, and take Copies of all such Records as they thought necessary for my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, which was Granted and Order'd accordingly.</p>
                     <p>My <hi>Councel's</hi> Quaeries having been formerly sent down to <hi>the House of Commons,</hi> they were there referred to a Committee of Lawyers to consider of; and on <hi>September</hi> 27. <hi>Friday,</hi> they were earnestly called <note place="margin">Septemb. <hi>27.</hi>

<pb n="425" facs="tcp:54614:224"/>
were so general and uncertain, that almost any Crime, by Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Constructions, might be, and was often extended to be a Treason; in so much, as we find in 22<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. of the Book of Assize, Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the King's Messenger was Treason. And in the Parliament Roll, 21 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Numero</hi> 15. accroaching the Royal Power (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in every Excess was subject to a Construction of Treason) was Treason; for which divers having suffered, the <hi>Commons</hi> in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, finding how mischievous and destructive it was to the Subject, Petitioned it might be bounded and declared. And this, not to give any Liberty, but to give Bounds to it; one while it being <note place="margin">The uncertainty of what was, or was not Treason, produced the Law of <hi>25 Ed. 3.</hi>
                           </note> construed an Accroachment of Royal Power, as in the Case of the Earl of <hi>Lancaster temp. Ed.</hi> 2. for being over Popular with the People; and in the same King's Reign to <hi>Spencer,</hi> for being over Gracious with the King.</p>
                        <p>The sense of these and other Mischiefs by the uncertainty of Treason, brought on this <note place="margin">The Parliament of <hi>25 Ed. 3.</hi> by Reason of that Law called <hi>Parliamentum Benedictum,</hi> and that no Law had deservedly more Honour than <hi>Magna Charta.</hi>
                           </note> Law of 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. and the benefit of it to the Subject, says Sir <hi>Ed.

mentioned, saith, a compassing to Levy War, is not a Treason within that Law, unless it proceed into Act; but only to Compass the Death of the King: Yet if a Constructive Treason should be admitted, it might happily without any great straining be inferred, that compassing to Levy War, is in some sort a compassing of the King's Death; and of this Kind many more Instances may be given.</p>
                        <p>So that the result of all this is, that whatsoever is not declared <note place="margin">☜</note> to be a Treason within the Letter of this Law; may not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged a Treason, by Inference, Construction, or otherwise.</p>
                        <p>Having done with this First, we now shall come to our Second Question.</p>
                        <p>Whether any the Matters in all, or any the Articles Charged, <note place="margin">
                              <hi>2.</hi> Question.</note> contain any the Treasons declared by that Law, or Enacted by any subsequent Law; wherein, although the Charges may appear to be Great and Enormous Crimes; yet we shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, and hope to satisfie your Lordships, the same nor any of them, are Treasons by any established Law of the Kingdom: For clearing whereof, we shall pursue the Order first proposed.</p>
                        <p>First, that an Endeavour to subvert Fundamental Laws, is not Treason by any Law in this Kingdom Established; and particular Act to make it Treason there is none; so as we must then return to apply those former general Observations of that <hi>Act</hi> of 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. to this Particular; and shall add for Reasons,
<list>
                              <item>1. That it is not comprized within any the Words of that Law, nor may by any Construction or Inference be brought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it, for the Reasons formerly alledged.</item>
                              <item>2. Because an Endeavour to subvert Laws, is of so great a Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Uncertainty, that every Action not Warranted by Law, may be thereby extended to be a Treason.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the Sixth <hi>Report,</hi> in <hi>Mildmays</hi> Case <hi>Fol.</hi> 42. where a Conveyance <note place="margin">Mildmay's <hi>case</hi> 6. <hi>Report</hi> Coke <hi>fol.</hi> 42.</note> was made in Tail, with a Proviso, if he did go about or attempt to discontinue the Entail, the same should be void: It was resolved the Proviso was void; and the principal Reason was, that these Words attempt or go about, are Words uncertain and void in Law. <note place="margin">☜</note> And the Words of the Book are very observable; <hi>viz. God defend that Inheritances and Estates of Men should depend upon such incertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; for that</hi> Misera est Servitus ubi Jus est vagum, &amp; quod non defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitur in Jure quid fit conatus; <hi>and therefore the Rule of the Law doth decide this point.</hi> Non efficit conatus nisi sequitur effectus; <hi>and the Law doth reject Conations and goings about, as things uncertain which cannot be put in issue:</hi> These are the Words of the Book. And if so consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in Estates, your Lordships, we conceive, will hold it far more considerable in a Case of Life, which is of highest Consequence.</p>
                        <p>And if it should be said this <hi>Law</hi> of 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. takes notice of <note place="margin">Objection. Answer.</note> Compassing and Imagining: We answer, it is in a Particular decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by that <hi>Law</hi> to be Treason, in Compassing the death of the King. But this of Endeavouring to subvert Laws, not declared by that or any other Law to be a Treason.</p>
                        <p>And if it should be granted, that this <hi>Law</hi> might in any Case ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:54614:226"/>
any other Fact to be Treason by Inference or Construction; other than is therein particularly declared; which we conceive it cannot.</p>
                        <p>Yet it is not Imaginable, that a Law introduced purposely to limit and ascertain Crimes of so high Consequence, should by Constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or Inference be subject to a Construction of admitting so <note place="margin">☞</note> uncertain and indefinite a thing, as an endeavour to subvert the Law is, it being not comprised within the Letter of that <hi>Law.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <list>
                           <item>3. That the Subversion of the Law is an impossible thing; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Endeavour to do an act which cannot be effected, cannot be Treason</item>
                           <item>4. That in all times the Endeavouring to subvert the Laws hath been conceived no determinate Crime, but rather an Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation only of a Crime, than otherwise.

                        <p>This no more than that former of subverting the Laws is any Treason, within any Law established in this Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>And herein, as to the Charge of the Endeavour, we shall rely upon what hath been already said upon the former.</p>
                        <p>With this further:</p>
                        <p>That until that happy Reformation, begun in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. there was another Frame of Religion established by Law; which was conceived until then to have been the <hi>True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi> and any Endeavour to Change or Alter it, prosecuted with great Extremities.

                        <p>That in the Parliament of 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. amongst the many Articles preferred against the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and others, the <hi>14th Article</hi> contains a Charge much of this Nature; <hi>viz.

                     <p>My Lords,</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>We have now gone through those Articles, wherein, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, the Treasons Charged were intended; and have endeavoured to make it appear. That none of the Matters in any of the Articles Charged, are Treason within the Letter of any Law.</p>
                        <p>And if not so; then they cannot, by Inference or Parity of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, be heightned to a Treason.</p>
                        <p>It is true, the Crimes, as they are laid in the Charge, are great and many.</p>
                        <p>Yet if the Laws of this Realm, which have distinguished Crimes, and accordingly given them several Names, and inflicted Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, raise none of these to a Treason;</p>
                        <p>That we humbly conceive will be worthy of <hi>your Lordships</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration <note place="margin">Number of Crimes below Treason or Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, cannot make a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> in this Case; and that their Number cannot make them exceed their Nature: And if they be but Crimes and Misdemeanours apart, below Treason or Felony, they cannot make a Treason by putting them together.</p>
                        <p>Otherwise, the <hi>Statute</hi> of 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. which we have so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted upon, had been fruitless and vain; if after all that exactness, any Number of Misdemeanours (in themselves no Treason) should by complication produce a Treason, and yet no mention made of it in that Law; much less any Determination thereby, that any Number, or what Number, and of what Nature of Crimes, below Treason, should make a Treason.</p>

                        <p>And that hereby might seem to be inferred, That there should be some other Treasons than are mentioned in that Law, which may be declared in Parliament.</p>
                        <p>But, <hi>my Lords,</hi> we shall observe,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. If such Declaration look only forward, then the Law making <note place="margin">☜</note> it Treason preceeds the Offence, and is no more than an Enacting Law.</p>
                        <p>If it look backward to the Offence past, then it appears by the <note place="margin">☜</note> very Clause it self, of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>it should be at the least a Felony at the Common Law;</hi> and that a Crime, or Crimes, below a Felony, were never intended to be by this <hi>Law</hi> to be declared, or to be heightned to a Treason. And we find not any Crime declared Treason with a Retrospect, unless it were a Felony before: And in the late Case of <note place="margin">

                        <p n="2">2. Secondly, We are not now in case of a Declaration of a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; but before <hi>your Lordships</hi> only upon an Impeachment; and in such case, we <note place="margin">Whatsoever hath been hitherto placed in the Margin of this <hi>Argument,</hi> was transcribed from Mr. <hi>Hern's</hi> own Copy: But this which followeth, I transcribed from a loose Note, wrote by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known hand, and affixed to this place. <hi>H.

                     <p>After this, there went up and down, all about <hi>London</hi> and the Suburbs, a <hi>Petition</hi> for the bringing of <hi>Delinquents</hi> to Justice; and some Preachers exhorted the People to be zealous in it, telling them it was for the Glory of God, and the Good of the Church. By this means, they got many Hands of Men which little thought what they went about.
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:54614:228"/>
In this Petition, none were named but my self and the Bishop of <hi>Ely;</hi> so their Drift was known to none but their own Party; and was undoubtedly set on foot to do me mischief. Whose Design this was, God knows; but I have cause to suspect Mr. <hi>Pryn's</hi> Hand in it. This barbarous way of the Peoples clamouring upon great Courts of Justice, as if they knew not how to govern themselves and the Causes brought before them, is a most unchristian Course, and not to be endured in any well-governed State. This Petition, with a Multitude of Hands to it, was delivered to the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> on <hi>Munday, Octob.</hi> 28. Concerning which, I shall observe this, That <note place="margin">

What this, and such-like Courses as these, may bring upon this City, God alone knows, whom I humbly pray to shew it Mercy.</p>

I humbly besought them, that <hi>my Councel</hi> and my <hi>Solicitor</hi> (who were always present with me in the <hi>Lords House</hi>) might stand now by me: But it would not be granted. Then Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> by Order from the <hi>Speaker,</hi> delivered the Collection and Sum of the Charge against me; much at one with that which he formerly made in the <hi>Lords House.</hi> Now I took Notes of it as exactly as I could. He had no sooner done, but Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi> pressed me to make Answer presently. I humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought the <hi>House</hi> I might not be put to that, the Charge being long and various; but that I might have Time; and, that <hi>my</hi>
                        <pb n="433" facs="tcp:54614:228"/>
                        <hi>Councel</hi> might be heard for Matter of Law: I was commanded to withdraw. And when I was called in again, I received an Order peremptory, to Answer the <hi>Munday</hi> sev'n-night after, <hi>To such Things as the Reporter was mistaken in.</hi> But not a word of Hearing <hi>my Councel.</hi> I returned to my Prison.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Wednesday, Novemb.</hi> 6. I got my Prayer-Book, by the help of <note place="margin">Novemb. <hi>6.</hi>
                        </note> Mr. <hi>Hern</hi> and Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> out of Mr. <hi>Pryn's</hi> hands, where it had been ever since <hi>the last of May,</hi> 1643.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Munday, Novemb.</hi> 11. I came to the <hi>House of Commons</hi> again; and <note place="margin">Novemb. <hi>11.</hi>
                        </note> according to their peremptory Order, made my Answer to the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Charge which Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> made against me. But here I shall advertise the Reader, That to avoid troublesom and tedious Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, I shall not set down my Answer at large, as there I spake it; because there is nothing in it but what is in my former Answers, the Beginning and the End only excepted. But it was necessary for me then to make a whole and an entire Answer, because the <hi>House of Commons</hi> had then heard no Part of my Defence. But, I presume, the Charitable Reader will look upon my Answers in their proper place, rather than be troubled a second time with the same thing. Yet because Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> went a different way in his Summary, from the Charge largely given, I shall represent a <hi>Skeleton</hi> of my Answer, with all the Limbs of it entire, that it may be seen, as it were, together; though I report nothing which hath been already said. And thus I began:</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I was here <hi>Novemb.</hi> 2. It was the first time that ever <note place="margin">My Defence in the House of <hi>Commons.</hi>
                           </note> I came within these Doors: And here then you gave me the most uncomfortable Break-fast that ever I came to; namely, That this <hi>Honourable House</hi> had drawn up an <hi>Ordinance</hi> against me of High Treason; but that before they would proceed farther, I should hear the Sum of the Charge which was against me; which was the cause I was sent for then. And to give my Answer to that which was then said, or rather mistaken in saying and inferring, is the cause of my coming now.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p n="1">1. And first, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I give Thanks to this <hi>Honourable House,</hi> that they have given me leave to speak for my self. 2. Secondly, I do humbly desire, if any Word or Thing should be mistaken, or unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly expressed by me (which shall be sore against my Will) I may have liberty to re-call and expound my self. 3. Thirdly, That you will favourably consider into what Straits I am cast, that after a long and tedious Hearing, I must now come to answer to a Sum, or an <hi>Epitome</hi> of the same Charge; which how dangerous it may be for me, all Men that know <hi>Epitomes,</hi> cannot but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I am come hither to make a <hi>Brief</hi> of my Answer to a <hi>Sum</hi> of my Charge; wherein I may receive as much Detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by my own Brief, for want of larger Expression; as by the other of my Charge, by omission or mistake. Yet since your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is upon me, I shall, without farther Preface (which I conceive would be as tedious to you, as to me troublesom) address my self, and with as much Brevity as the many Heads of the Charge will bear. And that my Answer may be the clearer, both to this <hi>Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi>
                        <pb n="434" facs="tcp:54614:229"/>
                        <hi>House,</hi> and to the Gentleman who reported the Charge, I shall follow every thing in the same order he proceeded in. So far forth at least, as an old slow Hand could take them, a heavy Heart observe them, and an old decayed Memory retain them.</p>
                     <p>This worthy Gentleman hath pressed all things as hardly against me, as the Cause can any way bear: That was his Duty to this <hi>Honourable House,</hi> and it troubles me not. But his Carriage and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions were civil towards me, in this my great Affliction: And for this I render him humble and hearty Thanks; having from other Hands pledged my <hi>Saviour</hi> in Gall and Vinegar, and drunk up the Cup of the Scornings of the People to the very bottom.</p>
                     <p>This Gentleman began with four <hi>Generals,</hi> which he said I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, and I say I had cause so to do. The first Complaint was, <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                        <hi>That I had lain three Years in Prison before I was heard.</hi> And this, he said, was my own fault, because I delayed the putting in of my full An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer when I was called. But herein he is quite mistaken. For I could not answer till I was called, and I was not called in three Years: Nor then could I plead to more Articles than were put to me. [Nor did this delay Three Months, of the Three Year. Yet this Gentleman in his Reply, said still, it was my Fault, <hi>because I did not Petition to be brought to Hearing.</hi> But this, under Favour, is a Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Reason than the former. For the condition of the Times considered, neither my <hi>Councel,</hi> nor my other Friends, nor my self; could think that a fit or a discreet way. Besides, it is well known, that had I Petitioned, I could not have been Heard, my Business being in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner cast aside, till Mr. <hi>Pryn's</hi> Malice, actuated by a Search into my own Papers, undertook it.] The Gentleman said, my Second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint <note place="margin">2.</note> was, <hi>That my Papers were Seized:</hi> But he said that was done by Authority. And I never denyed that. But that which he added is much mistaken, namely, that I ever Seized any Man's Papers without Authority, or by my own Power; but what was done in that kind, was by the Joynt Authority of that Court, in which I then sat. Nor was my Complaint general, that my Papers were Seized; but that the Papers prepared for my Defence were taken from me, and not restored when I needed them, and Petitioned for them. He said, my Third Complaint was, <hi>That many of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                        <hi>produced against me were Separatists.</hi> I did indeed complain of this, and I had abundant Cause so to do. For there was scarce an active Separatist in <hi>England,</hi> but some way or other his Influence was into this Business against me. And whereas, the Gentleman said, <hi>the Witnesses were some Aldermen, and some Gentlemen, and Men of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> That's nothing; for both Gentlemen, and Aldermen, and Men of all Conditions, (the more's the pity) as the Times now go, are Separatists from the Doctrine and Discipline of <hi>the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Established by Law. And I would to God some of my Judges were not. My Fourth Complaint he said was, <hi>of the excessive Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                        <hi>of the Witnesses.</hi> And he added, that if I would not have so many Witnesses, I should not have given occasion for it, by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting so many Crimes. But First, whether I have committed so many Crimes as are urged against me, is yet in Question. And Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, 'tis one thing to give Cause, and another thing to give Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion:
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:54614:229"/>
For an Occasion may be taken, when 'tis pretended as gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And so I hope it will be found in my Case. But the thing here mistaken is, That these are all said to be <hi>Legal Witnesses,</hi> whereas almost all of them have, at some time or other, been before me as their Judge, either at <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> or <hi>Council-Table,</hi> or <hi>High-Commission,</hi> or as Referee. And then I humbly desire it may be considered. First how impossible it is for a Judge to please all Men. Secondly, how improbable it is, that Witnesses displeased should be indifferent in their Testimony. And Thirdly, how hard it is to convince a Man by such interessed Witnesses, now (upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) becoming Judges of him that Judged them. And (as <note n="*" place="margin">Quomodo potest malus litigator landare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </p>
                     <p>From these <hi>Generals</hi> the Gentleman passed to the Particulars of the Charge; and he caused the 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Original Articles, and the 7. Additional to be read. That done, he divided the Charge into two main Heads: The one, an Endeavour in me to subvert the Laws of the Kingdom: And the other, a like Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to alter the true <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion into <hi>Popery.</hi> The Evidence given in the <hi>Lords House</hi> began at <hi>the Laws,</hi> and ended in <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> but this Gentleman in his Summ, both there and here, began with <hi>Religion,</hi> and ended with the <hi>Laws.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Charge concerning <hi>Religion,</hi> he said, would bear two Parts, <note place="margin">I.</note> the Ceremonial and the Substantial part of Religion.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1) And he professed he would begin at the Ceremonial, where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving First charged in general, the <hi>Statute</hi> of the 3 and 4 of <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. 6. 10. for the destruction of Images; he gave these particular Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces following, to shew my Intention to alter Religion.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The setting up of Coloured Glass with Pictures in the Windows of my Chappel; the Communion-Table Altar-wise; Candlesticks thereon, with Reverence and Bowings.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A Bible in my Study with the Five Wounds of Christ wrought upon the Cover in Needle-Work.</p>

                     <p n="7">7. The Abuses in the Universities, especially <hi>Oxford.</hi>

                        <pb n="436" facs="tcp:54614:230"/>
9. That I preferred no Men, but such as were active for the Ceremonies.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Passages expunged out of Books, if contrary to these Courses; as that in Dr. <hi>Featly's</hi> Sermons concerning Images.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Bibles with Pictures in them.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. The severe Punishment of Mr. <hi>Workman</hi> of <hi>Gloucester;</hi> only for a Sermon against Images.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Words spoken to take Bishop <hi>Jewell's</hi> Works <hi>and the Book of Martyrs</hi> out of some Parish-Churches.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. The Consecration of <hi>Cree-Church,</hi> and S. <hi>Giles in the Fields.</hi> In all which, as I humbly conceive, here's nothing (especially my Answers being taken to them) that can co-operate to any alteration of Religion. Nor is there any Treason, were all that is urged true.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2) From hence, <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi> this worthy Gentleman passed over from the Ceremonies, to those things which he said concerned the Substance of Religion. In which, the Particulars which he Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged were these:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A doubtfulness, if not a denyal of the Pope's being <hi>Antichrist.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Dislike of the Name, <hi>the Idol of Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The alteration of some passages in the Publick Prayers appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>Novemb.</hi> 5. <hi>and the Coronation Day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. The <hi>Antichristian Yoak</hi> left out of the Brief for the <hi>Palatinat,</hi> with an expression, as if we and those Reformed Churches were not of the same Religion.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That Men were punished for Praying for <hi>the Queen,</hi> and <hi>the Prince.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a true Church.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That the Communion-Table or Altar is the Chief Place: For there's <hi>Hoc est Corpus meum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. Restraint of all Books against Popery. Instances in a Book of Bishop <hi>Carleton's.</hi> One tendred by Sir <hi>Edward Hungerford.</hi> Dr. <hi>Clarke's</hi> Sermons. Dr. <hi>Jones.</hi> None called in but <hi>Sales.</hi> That I my self did expunge some Passages out of a Sermon of Dr. <hi>Sibthorp's.</hi> Popish Books seized, re-delivered to the Owners. That for these I must answer for my Chaplains, since <hi>John</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>York</hi> was fined for his Commissary's Act against the Bishop of <hi>Durham;</hi> who having a Patent, could not so easily be put out of his Place, as I might change my Chaplains.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Three Ministers in my Diocess suspended for not reading the <hi>Book of Recreations</hi> on the Lord's Day.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The Feoffment for buying in of Impropriations overthrown, to the hindrance of Preaching, and Scandal to Religion.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Incroachment upon the Lord <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> for naming of Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains to the King; and upon the <hi>Master of the Wards</hi> for giving of Benefices.</p>

                        <pb n="437" facs="tcp:54614:230"/>
14. That an Offer was made unto me to be a Cardinal. And thus far this Gentleman proceeded in points of Religion.</p>
                     <p>But because there hath passed divers things done at and by the <hi>Council-Table,</hi> the Courts <hi>of Star-Chamber,</hi> and <hi>High-Commission,</hi> and <hi>in Convocation;</hi> and because many more things so done, are to come in the next Head concerning the Law; I humbly crave leave, for avoiding tedious Repetition, to say it once for all, That no act done by any of these, either by full Consent or major Part, which involves the rest, ought to be charged singly against me. And that for these Reasons following:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. First, because this is not <hi>Peccare cum Multis:</hi> For they meet not there in a Relation as <hi>Multi;</hi> but as <hi>Vnum Aggregatum;</hi> as Bodies made one by Law. And therefore the Acts done by them, are Acts of those Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, not of any one Man sitting in them. And in this Sense a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is one Body consisting of many; and the Acts done by it are Acts of Parliament. For which (should any of them prove amiss) no one Man is answerable, though many times one Man brings in the Bill.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, because I could sway no Man's Vote in any of those Places, (though this hath been often urged against me, as an <hi>Over Potent Member</hi>) for my Vote was either last, or last save one, in all these Places. So I could not lead. Nor is there any so much as shew of Proof offered, that I moved, or prepared any Man to a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence one way or other, in any one of these Courts or Places.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thirdly, because in those Courts of Judicature, there was the Assistance of able Judges, Lawyers, and Divines for direction. And how can that be a Treason in me, which is not made so much as a Misdemeanour in any of the rest?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Fourthly, because the Act of this present Parliament, which hath taken away the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> and the <hi>High-Commission,</hi> and bounded the <hi>Council-Table,</hi> looks forward only, and punishes no Man for any Act past; much less doth it make any Man's Actions done in them to be Treason: And I am no way excluded from the Benefit of that Act.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Lastly, because in all my Proceedings, both in the <hi>High-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> and elsewhere, I kept strictly to the Doctrine and Discipline <hi>of the Church of England</hi> Established by Law, against both Papist and other Sectaries. And under this Government, and Doctrine of this Church, it hath pleased God, now for above Fourscore Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to Bless this Kingdom and People above other Nations. And I pray God if we forsake the one, it prove not a Cause to deprive us of the other.</p>
                     <p>And now, <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi> I shall follow this worthy Gentleman, as <note place="margin">II.</note> he went on to the Second General Head, <hi>the Subversion of the Laws.</hi> And here, when he had caused the 1, 2, 3, 5, and 14. Original Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles to be read, as also the 2, 9, and 10. Additionals; He then said, that I had laboured this Subversion by <hi>my Counsels</hi> and by my <hi>Actions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) By <hi>my Counsels</hi> First; Of which he gave Three Instances.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Vote of the <hi>Council-Table</hi> to Assist the <hi>King</hi> in Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ways; if the Parliament should prove peevish and refuse. And this out of my <hi>Diary,</hi> at <hi>Decemb.</hi> 5. 1639.</p>

And for this last concerning <hi>Parliaments,</hi> I humbly and heartily desire, that this may be taken notice of, and remembred, That there is not, in any one of these Paper-Proofs produced against me, any one thing that offers to take away any Rights of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> rightly understood; much less any that offers to take away <hi>Parliaments</hi> themselves: Which is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Mistake all along this particular Charge. And if any rash or unweighed Words have fallen from me, yet these cannot be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the disannulling of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> or their Priviledges in any kind, which I defended in Print long since, before I could foresee any of this Danger threatning me: It is in my Book <note n="*" place="margin">

It was read in the <hi>Lords House,</hi> and I humbly desire I may read it here. And it was read.</p>
                     <p>After this, it was inferred by this worthy Gentleman, <hi>what a great Offender I was, and greater than Cardinal</hi> Woolsey. Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I have seen the Articles against the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> and sure some body is mistaken; for some of them are far greater than any thing that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved against me. In which (I thank Christ for it) my Conscience is at peace, whereas the <hi>Cardinal</hi> confessed himself guilty of them all; and yet no thought of <hi>Treason</hi> committed: And a <hi>Premunire</hi> was all that was laid upon him.</p>
                     <p>Then he gave a touch, That <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>An.</hi> 45. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.</note> in <hi>Edward</hi> III.'s time, there was a Complaint, That too much of the Civil Government was in the hands of the Bishops; and <hi>that in the 45th Year of his Reign, they were put out, and Lay-men put in.</hi> But first, this concerns not me. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the late Act of this Parliament hath taken sufficient Order with that Calling, for medling in Civil Affairs. Thirdly, the time is memorable when this was done: It was in the Forty and fifth Year of <hi>Edward</hi> III. That's enough.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I shall draw towards an end. Yet not forgetting what Ordinance you told me was drawn up against me; If that which I have now said may any way satisfie this <hi>Honourable House</hi> to make stay of it, or to mitigate it, I shall bless God and you for it. And I humbly desire you to take into consideration, my Calling, my Age, my former Life, my Fall, my Imprisonment, long and strict; That these Considerations may move with you. In my Prosperity (I bless God for it) I was never puffed up into Vanity, whatever the World may think of me. And in these last full four Years du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, I thank the same God, <note n="*" place="margin">Tacit. L. <hi>6.</hi> Annal.</note> 
                        <hi>Gravem Fortunam constanter tuli,</hi> I have with decent Constancy born the weight of a pressing Fortune: And I hope God will strengthen me unto, and in the end of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi> I am very <note n="*" place="margin">Annum jam a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens septuagesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum secundum.</note> aged, considering the Turmoils of my Life; and I daily find in my self more Decays than I make shew of; and the Period of my Life, in the Course of Nature, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be far off. It cannot but be a great Grief unto me, to stand at these Years thus Charged before ye: Yet give me leave to say thus much without Offence, Whatsoever Errours or Faults I may have committed by the way, in any my Proceedings, through Human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity; as who is He that hath not offended, and broken some Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute-Laws too by Ignorance, or Misapprehension, or Forgetfulness, at some sudden time of Action? Yet if God Bless me with so much Memory, I will die with these Words in my Mouth: <hi>That I never intended, much less endeavoured the subversion of the Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; nor the bringing in of Popish Superstition upon the true Protestant Religion, Established by Law in this Kingdom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now, <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi> having done with the Fact, I have but this one thing to put to the Consideration of this <hi>Honourable House.</hi> My Charge hath been repeated, I confess, by a very worthy and a very able Gentleman. But <hi>Ability</hi> is not absolute in any. The Evidence given against me before the <hi>Lords,</hi> was (as by the Law it ought to be) given in upon Oath: But the Evidence now summed up, and presented to this <hi>Honourable House,</hi> is but upon the Collection and
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:54614:232"/>
Judgment of one Man, how able or intire soever; and what he conceived is proved against me, is but according to <hi>his</hi> Judgment and Memory; which perhaps may differ much from the Opinion and Judgment of the Judges themselves, who heard the Evidence at large: Nor was this Gentleman himself present every Day of my Hearing; and then for those Days in which he was absent, he can report no more here, than what others have reported to him. So for so much, his Repetition here is but a Report of a Report of Evidence given: And at the best but a Report of Evidence, and not upon Oath. And, I suppose, never any <hi>Jurors,</hi> who are Tryers of the Fact in any Case, Civil or Criminal, did ever ground their <hi>Verdict</hi> upon an Evidence only Reported before them, and which themselves heard not.</p>
                     <p>And if this manner of Proceeding shall be thought less conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in my Person; yet I humbly desire it may be thoroughly weighed in the prudent Judgment of this <hi>Honourable House,</hi> the great Preserver of the Laws and Liberties of the Subject of <hi>England,</hi> how far it doth or may trench upon these in future Consequences, if these great <hi>Boundaries</hi> be laid loose and open.</p>
                     <p>And because my Infirmities are many and great, which Age and Grief have added to those which are naturally in me, I most humbly desire again, That <hi>my Councel</hi> may be heard for point of Law, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the former Concession of this <hi>Honourable House:</hi> For I assure my self, upon that which hath been pleaded to the <hi>Lords,</hi> That no one, nor all of the things together which are charged against me, if proved (which I conceive they are not) can make me guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>High Treason,</hi> by any known Established Law of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                     <p>The Sum of all is this: Upon an Impeachment arising from this <hi>House,</hi> I have pleaded <hi>Not Guilty.</hi> Thereupon Issue hath been joined, and Evidence given in upon Oath. And now I must humbly leave it to you, your Wisdom and Justice, Whether it shall be thought Fit, and Just, and Honourable, to Judge me here, only upon a Report, or a  Hearsay, and that not upon Oath.</p>

                     <p>HEre ended the heavy Business of this Day. I was exceeding faint with speaking so long; and I had great pain and soreness in my Breast for almost a Fortnight after; then, I thank God, it wore away. I was commanded to withdraw, and to attend the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Novemb.</hi> 13. 1644.</note> House again on <hi>Wednesday, Novemb.</hi> 13. which I did. Then Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> made a Reply to my Answer: The Reply had some great Mistakes in it; but else was for the most part but a more earnest Affirming of what he had delivered. And I conceived I was not to Answer to his Reply, but that he was to have the last Speech: For so it was always carried, during my Hearing in the <hi>Lords House.</hi> Therefore being dismissed, I went away: And I was no sooner gone, but the <hi>House</hi> called for the <hi>Ordinance</hi> which was drawn up against me, and without Hearing <hi>my Councel,</hi> or any more ado, Voted me Guilty of <hi>High Treason.</hi> And yet, when I came that Day to the <hi>House,</hi> all Men, and many of the <hi>House</hi> themselves did much magnifie my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer before given: I will forbear to set down in what Language, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was high; and as no time can be fit for <hi>Vanity,</hi> so least of all was this time for me: And <hi>Vain</hi> I must needs be thought, should I here relate what was told me from many and good Hands. But it seems the Clamour prevailed against me.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Saturday, Novemb.</hi> 16. this <hi>Ordinance</hi> was passed the <hi>House of</hi>

                        <hi>Commons</hi> suddenly, and with so great deliberation, as you have heard, was transmitted to the <hi>Lords;</hi> and by them the Debate concerning it put off to <hi>Friday, Novemb.</hi> 22. Then the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> began more <note place="margin">Novemb. <hi>22.</hi>
                        </note> fully to shew his canker'd Humour against me; how provoked, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test I know not, unless by my serving him far beyond his Desert. There, among other course Language, he bestowed (as I am infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) the <hi>Rascal</hi> and the <hi>Villain</hi> upon me. And told the <hi>Lords,</hi> they would put off giving their Consent to the <hi>Ordinance,</hi> till the Citizens would come down, and call for Justice, as they did in my Lord <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's</hi> Case. Was there not Justice and Wisdom in this Speech? <note place="margin">Novemb. <hi>23:</hi> Novemb. <hi>29.</hi> Novemb. <hi>28.</hi>
                        </note> Hereupon the Business was put off to <hi>Saturday, Novemb.</hi> 23. and then to <hi>Friday, Novemb.</hi> 29. But then upon <hi>Thursday, Novemb.</hi> 28. Mr. <hi>Strowd</hi> came up with a Message from the <hi>Commons,</hi> to quicken the <hi>Lords</hi> in this Business: And at the end of his Message, he let fall, That <hi>they should do well to agree to the Ordinance, or else the Multitude would come down and force them to it.</hi> At this, some Lords very honourably took Exception; and Mr. <hi>Strowd</hi> durst not bide it, that this was any part of the Message delivered him by the <hi>House of Commons.</hi> But the matter was passed over, and Mr. <hi>Strowd</hi> not so much as checked. This, it may be, was thought seasonable by some, to hearten on the Violence of the Earl of <hi>Pembroke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Business not long heard on <hi>Friday,</hi> was put off again to <hi>Munday Decemb.</hi> 2. and the <hi>House of Lords</hi> put into a Committee, to examine <note place="margin">Decemb. <hi>

Days. Where their own Notes failed, they called to Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> Clerk of their <hi>House,</hi> for his. But at last, finding him very ready and quick for any thing that was Charged against me, but loth to be known what Answer I gave to any Point, some Lords observed it. And it did after appear, that the Notes which he put to <hi>the Lords,</hi> were not the Notes which himself took, but that he had a Copy given him, (whether by Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> or any other, I know not) and I was informed that the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> had another Copy of the very same. This is marvellous Just and Honourable in <hi>that Earl:</hi> And most Christian-like in Mr. <hi>Brown.</hi> It may be, he learned it out of the Notes which his Father-in-Law takes at Sermons.</p>
                     <p>Upon <hi>Munday December</hi> 16. there was (the Times considered) a <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Decemb.</hi> 16. 1644.</note> very full <hi>House of Lords;</hi> about Twenty present, and my Business largely debated, and ready to come to the Question. I wish with all my Heart it had, while the <hi>House</hi> was so full. But the <hi>Earl of Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke</hi> fell again into his wonted violence: And asked <hi>the Lords</hi> what they stuck at? And added; <hi>what, shall we think the House of</hi> Commons <hi>had no Conscience in passing this</hi> Ordinance? <hi>Yes, they knew well enough what they did.</hi> One of the Wits hearing this Excellent Passage of <hi>the Earl's;</hi> Protested, If ever he lived to see a Parliament in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> this Prudent Earl should be Speaker, if he were able to procure him the Place.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time this Unhappy Clamour of his, put the Business <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Decemb.</hi> 17.</note> off again to the next day, being <hi>Tuesday;</hi> Then there were but four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Lords in the <hi>House.</hi> My Business was assumed, and proposed in three Questions, and I was Voted Guilty of the Fact in all three. Namely, Guilty of endeavouring to Subvert the Laws: To Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion: And that I was an Enemy to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Then it being put to the Judges, whether this were Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or no; the Judges unanimously declared, that nothing which was charged against me was Treason, by any known and established Law of the Land, with many things to and fro concerning this Business.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Tuesday Christmas-Eve,</hi> the <hi>Lords</hi> had a Conference with the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Decemb.</hi> 24.</note> 
                        <hi>Commons</hi> about it. In which they declared, that they had diligently weighed all things that were charged against me, but could not by any one of them, or all, find me guilty of Treason. And therefore desired that the <hi>Argument</hi> made by my <hi>Councel</hi> might be Answered. And if it could be made appear unto them by any Law, to be Treason, they would then proceed farther, as in Honour and Justice they should find fit. Then came <hi>Christmas-day,</hi> the last <hi>Wednesday</hi> in the Month, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Decemb.</hi> 25.</note> and a most Solemn Fast kept on it, with as Solemn an <hi>Ordinance</hi> for the due observance of this Fast, and against the manner of keeping of that day in former Superstitious Times. A Fast never before heard of in <hi>Christendom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this Conference, Mr. <hi>Serjeant Wild</hi> speaking freely to some Friends about this Business, told them, he wonder'd <hi>the Lords</hi> should <hi>so much distrust their Judgments,</hi> as to desire a Conference about it. To see how good Wits agree! Surely, I believe he was of the <hi>Earl of Pembroke's</hi> Councel, or <hi>the Earl</hi> of his, they jump so together. It seems in these Mens Opinions, <hi>the House of Commons</hi> can neither Err in Conscience nor Judgment. Howsoever, that <hi>House</hi> thought it fit

                        <hi>the Lords</hi> should be satisfied, that I was by Law guilty of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And to that end sent up a Committee, <hi>Jan:</hi> 2. 1644. to make <note place="margin">

                     <p>THE Reasons of the <hi>Commons</hi> for the Attainder of the Arch-Bishop, were at a Conference <hi>Jan.</hi> 2. by Serjeant <hi>Wild,</hi> Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nicolas,</hi> communicated to the <hi>Lords;</hi> who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, on the 4th of <hi>January,</hi> passed the <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>Attainder;</hi> whereby it was Ordained, that he should suffer Death, as in Cases of High Treason. And on the 6th of <hi>January</hi> it was Ordered by both Houses; that he should suffer accordingly on <hi>Friday</hi> the 10th. But on the 7th, <hi>the Lords</hi> at a Conference, acquainted the <hi>Commons,</hi> with a Letter and Petition from the Arch-Bishop, and a Pardon to him from <hi>the King,</hi> dated the 12th of <hi>April</hi> 19 <hi>Car.</hi> of which he desired the benefit; but the same was over-ruled and rejected. His Petition was, that in case he must Die, Dr: <hi>Stern,</hi> Dr: <hi>Heywood,</hi> and Dr: <hi>Martin,</hi> might be permitted to be with him, before and at his Death, to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister Comfort to his Soul; and that the manner of his Execution might be altered to Beheading. To which <hi>the Lords</hi> agreed; but the <hi>Commons</hi> then refused both; only granted, that Dr. <hi>Stern,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Marshal,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Palmer,</hi> should go to him; and one or both of the latter, to be constantly present, whilst Dr. <hi>Stern</hi> was with him. But the next day, upon another Petition of his, setting forth Reasons, from his being a Divine, a Bishop, one that had had the Honour to sit in the House of Peers, and of the King's Most Honourable Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, &amp;c. Praying in those regards, not to be exposed to such an Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious Death; the <hi>Commons</hi> consented to remit the rest of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and that he should suffer Death by being Beheaded.

                     <p>THE Bill of Attainder of the Arch-Bishop, passed in the House of <hi>Commons November</hi> 13. 1644. But yet the Business was not done; for the <hi>Lords</hi> stuck at it: Some of which, having not extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished all the Sparks of Humanity, began to find themselves Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate of his Condition, not knowing how soon it should or might be made their own, if once disfavoured by the Grandees of that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Faction. For the Ordinance having been Transmitted to the House of Peers, and the House of Peers deliberating somewhat long upon it, it was Voted on <hi>December</hi> 4. <hi>That all Books, Writings, and Evidences, which concerned the Tryal, should be brought before the Lords in Parliament;</hi> to the end, that they might seriously and distinctly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of all Particulars amongst themselves, as they came before them. But meaning to make sure work of it, they had in the mean time (after no small Evaporations of Heat and Passion) prepared an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which they sent up unto the Lords, importing the displacing of them from all those Places of Power and Command which they had in the Army. Which being found too weak to hold, they fall upon another and a likelier Project, which was to bring the Lords to sit in the Commons House, where they were sure they should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable both for Power and Number. And to effect the same with more speed and certainty, they had recourse to their Old Arts, drawing down <hi>Watkins</hi> with his General Muster of Subscriptions, and putting a <hi>Petition</hi> into his Hands, to be tendred by him to the Houses, that is, themselves: Wherein it was required amongst other things, That they should <hi>vigorously proceed unto the Punishment of all Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents;</hi> and that for the more quick dispatch of Publick Business of State, the <hi>Lords</hi> would please to Vote and Sit together with the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</hi> On such uncertain Terms, such a ticklish Tenure, did they then hold their Place and Power in Parliament, who so officiously complied with the House of <hi>Commons,</hi> in depriving the Bishops of their <hi>Vote,</hi> and the Church's Birth-Right. And this was it which helped them in that time of need. And yet not thinking this device sufficient to fright their Lordships to a present compliance, <hi>Strowd</hi> was sent up with a Message from the House of <hi>Commons,</hi> to let them
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:54614:234" rendition="simple:additions"/>
know, That the <hi>Londoners</hi> would shortly bring a Petition, with 20000 Hands to obtain that Ordinance. By which stale and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Stratagem, they wrought so far on some weak Spirits, the rest withdrawing themselves, (as formerly in the Case of the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>) that in a thin and slender House, not above six or seven in number, it was pass'd at last. The day before they pass'd the Ordinance for Establishing their New <hi>Directory;</hi> which in effect, was nothing but a total Abolition of the Common-Prayer-Book; and thereby shewed unto the World, how little hopes they had of setling their new Form of Worship, if the Foundation of it were not laid in the Blood of this Famous Prelate, who had so stoutly stood up for it, against all Novellism and Faction, in the whole course of his Life. It was certified by some Letters to <hi>Oxon,</hi> and so reported in the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius Aulicus</hi> of the following Week, That the Lord <hi>Bruce</hi> (but better known by the Name of the Earl of <hi>Elgin</hi>) was one of the Number of those few Lords, which had Voted to the Sentence of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: The others which concurred in that fatal Sentence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Earls of <hi>Kent, Pembroke, Salisbury,</hi> and <hi>Bullingbrook,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Lord <hi>North,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Wark.</hi> But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever may be said of the other six, I have been advertised lately from a very good Hand, that the said Lord <hi>Bruce</hi> hath frequently disclaimed that Action, and solemnly professed his detestation of the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, as most abhorrent from his Nature, and contrary to his known Affections, as well unto his Majesty's Service, as the Peace and Preservation of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Ordinance was no sooner passed, but it revived many of those Discourses which had before been made on the like occasion, in the Business of the Earl of <hi>Strafford.</hi>— Here we have a new-found Treason, never known before, nor declared such by any of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's Justices, nor ever brought to be considered of by the King and his Parliament; but only Voted to be such, by some of those Members which sate at <hi>Westminster,</hi> who were resolved to have it so for their private Ends. The first Example of this kind, the first that ever suffered Death by the Shot of an Ordinance, as himself very well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in his Dying Speech upon the Scaffold, (though purposely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in <hi>Hind's</hi> Printed Copy) to which now he hastneth.</p>
                     <p>For the passing of the Ordinance being signified to him by the then Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower;</hi> he neither entertained the News with a Stoical Apathy, nor wailed his Fate with weak and Womanish La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, (to which Extreams most Men are carried in this Case) but heard it with so even and so smooth a Temper, as shewed, he neither was ashamed to Live, nor afraid to Die. The time between the Sentence and Execution, he spent in Prayers and Applications to the Lord his God, having obtained, though not without some diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, a Chaplain of his own to Attend upon him, and to assist him in the work of his Preparation; though little Preparation needed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that Blow, which could not but be welcome, because long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.— On the Evening before his Passover, the Night before the dismal Combat betwixt him and Death, after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed his Spirits with a moderate Supper, he betook himself unto his Rest, and Slept very soundly, till the time came, in which his
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:54614:235"/>
Servants were appointed to Attend his Rising. A most assured sign of a Soul prepared.</p>
                     <p>The fatal Morning being come, he first applied himself to his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Prayers, and so continued, till <hi>Pennington</hi> and others of their Publick Officers, came to conduct him to the Scaffold; which he ascended with so brave a Courage, such a chearful Countenance, as if he had mounted, rather to behold a Triumph, than be made a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; and came not there to Die, but to be Translated. And though some Rude and Uncivil People, Reviled him as he pass'd along, with opprobrious Language, as loth to let him go to the Grave in Peace, yet it never discomposed his Thoughts, nor disturb'd his Patience. For he had profited so well in the School of <hi>Christ,</hi> that <hi>when he was reviled, he reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatned not,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 23.</note> 
                        <hi>but committed his Cause to him that Judgeth Righteously.</hi> And as he did not fear the Frowns, so neither did he covet the Applause of the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Herd; and therefore rather chose to read what he had to speak unto the People, than to affect the ostentation, either of Memory or Wit, in that dreadful Agony: Whether with greater Magnanimity than Prudence, I can hardly say. As for the matter of his Speech, besides what did concern himself and his own Purgation, his great care was to clear his Majesty and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to Popery; with a perswasion of the which, the Authors of the then present Miseries had abused the People, and made them take up Arms against their Soveraign. A Faithful Servant to the last: By means whereof, as it is said of <hi>Sampson</hi> in the Book of <hi>Judges,</hi> That <hi>the Men which he slew at his Death, were more than they which he</hi>

                        <hi>slew in his Life:</hi> So may it be affirmed of this Famous Prelate, That he gave a greater Blow unto the Enemies of the Church and the King, at the Hour of his Death, than he had given them in his whole Life before. But this you will more clearly see by the <hi>Speech</hi> it self, which followeth here according to the best and most perfect Copy, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his own Hands unto one of his Chaplains, and in his Name pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the King by the Lord <hi>John Bellasis</hi> at the Court in <hi>Oxon.</hi>

                     </head>
                     <q>
                        <p>Good People,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>THIS is an uncomfortable Time to Preach; yet I shall begin with a Text of Scripture,</hi> Heb. <hi>12. 2.</hi> Let us run with Patience the Race which is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the Author and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisher of our Faith; who for the Joy that was set before him, endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Cross, despising the Shame, and is set down at the right Hand of the Throne of God.</p>
                        <p>I have been long in my Race, and how I have <hi>looked to Jesus the Author and Finisher of my Faith,</hi> he best knows. I am now come to the End of my Race, and here I find the <hi>Cross,</hi> a Death of Shame. But the Shame must be despised, or no coming to the Right Hand of God. Jesus despised the Shame for me, and God forbid but that I should despise the Shame for him. I am going apace (as you see) towards the Red-Sea, and my Feet are now upon the very Brink of it; an Argument, I hope, that God is bringing me into the Land of Promise; for that was the way through which he led his People. But before they came to it, he instituted a Passover for them, <note place="margin">

And I shall remember it is the Lord's Passover: I shall not think of the Herbs, nor be angry with the Hand that gathereth them, but look up only unto him, who instituted that, and governs these. For Men <hi>can have no more Power over me, than what is given them from above.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>John</hi> 19. 11.</note> I am not in Love with this Passage through the Red-Sea, for I have the Weakness and Infirmities of Flesh and Blood plentifully in me; and I have prayed with my Saviour, <hi>Vt transiret Calix iste,</hi> That <hi>this Cup</hi> of Red Wine <hi>might pass from me;</hi> but if not, God's Will (not mine) be done: And I shall most willingly drink of this Cup, as deep as he pleases, and enter into this Sea; yea, and pass through it in the way that he shall lead me.</p>
                        <p>But I would have it remembred (Good People) that when God's Servants were in this Boisterous Sea, and <hi>Aaron</hi> amongst them, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> which persecuted them, (and did in a manner drive them into the Sea) were Drowned in the same Waters, while they were in pursuit of them.

                           <hi>fall into the Ditch.</hi> For my self, I am (and I acknowledge it in all Humility) a most grievous Sinner many ways, by Thought, Word and Deed: I cannot doubt but God hath Mercy in store for me (a poor Penitent) as well as for other Sinners. I have now, and upon this sad Occasion, ransacked every corner of my Heart; and yet (I thank God) I have not found (among the many) any one Sin, which deserves Death by any known Law of this Kingdom: And yet hereby I charge nothing upon my Judges; for if they proceed upon Proof (by valuable Witnesses) I, or any other Innocent, may be justly Condemned. And (I thank God) though the weight of my Sentence be heavy upon me, I am as quiet within, as ever I was in my Life. And though I am not only the First Arch-Bishop, but the First Man that ever died <note n="†" place="margin">In this way, <hi>Hind's</hi> Copy.</note> by an Ordinance in Parliament; yet some of my Predecessors have gone this way, though not by this means. For <hi>Elphegus</hi> was hurried away, and lost his Head by the <hi>Danes,</hi> and <hi>Simon Sudbury</hi> in the Fury of <hi>Wat Tiler</hi> and his Fellows. Before these, St. <hi>John Baptist</hi> had his Head Danced off by a lewd Woman; and St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> submitted his Head to a persecuting Sword. Many Examples, (Great and Good) and they teach me Patience; for I hope my Cause in Heaven will look of another Dye than the Colour that is put upon it here. And some Comfort it is to me, not only that I go the way of these Great Men in their several Generations; but also that my Charge (as foul as it is made) looks like that of the <hi>Jews</hi> against St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 25. 8. for he was Accused for the Law and the Temple, <hi>i. e.</hi> Religion: And like that of S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> Act. 6. 14. for breaking the Ordinances which <hi>Moses</hi> gave, <hi>i. e.</hi> Law and Religion, the Holy Place and the Temple, ver. 13. But you will then say, Do I then compare my self with the Integrity of St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Stephen?</hi> No, far be that from me. I only raise a Comfort to my self, that these great Saints and Servants of God, were laid at in their Time, as I am now. And it is memorable, that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who helped on this Accusation against St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> did after fall under the very same himself. Yea; but here is a great Clamour, that I would have brought in Popery: I shall answer that more fully by and by. In the mean time, you know what the Pharisees said against Christ himself; <hi>if we let him</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Job.</hi> 11. 48.</note> 
                           <hi>alone, all men will believe in him,</hi> &amp; venient Romani, <hi>and the Romans will come, and take away both our Place and Nation.</hi> Here was a cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less cry against Christ, that the <hi>Romans would come:</hi> And see how just the Judgment was; they Crucified <hi>Christ</hi> for fear lest the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> should come; and his Death was it which brought in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> upon them, God punishing them with that which they most feared. And I pray God, this Clamour of <hi>venient Romani,</hi> (of which I have given no cause) help not to bring them in. For the <hi>Pope</hi> never had such an Harvest in <hi>England</hi> since the Reformation, as he hath now upon the Sects and Divisions that are amongst us. In the mean time, <hi>by Honour and Dishonour, by good Report and evil Report, as Deceivers and yet true;</hi> am I passing through this World, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 8. Some Particulars also I think it not amiss to speak of.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="449" facs="tcp:54614:236"/>
And First, this I shall be bold to speak of the King our Gracious Soveraign. He hath been much traduced also for bringing in of Popery; but in my Conscience (of which I shall give God a very present Account) I know him to be as free from this Charge as any Man living; and I hold him to be as sound a Protestant (according to the Religion by Law Established) as any Man in this Kingdom; and that he will venture his Life as far and as freely for it. And I think I do, or should know, both his Affection to Religion, and his Grounds for it, as fully as any Man in <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Second Particular, is concerning this great and Populous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (which God bless.) Here hath been of late a Fashion taken up to gather Hands, and then go to the great Court of this Kingdom, (the Parliament) and Clamour for Justice; as if that Great and Wise Court, before whom the Causes come, (which are unknown to many) could not, or would not do Justice but at their appointment. A way which may endanger many an Innocent Man, and pluck his Blood upon their own Heads, and perhaps upon the City's also: and this hath been lately practised against my self, the Magistrates stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still, and suffering them openly to proceed from Parish to Parish, without any Check. God forgive the Setters of this, (with all my Heart I beg it) but many well-meaning People are caught by it. In St. <hi>Stephen's</hi> Case, when nothing else would serve, they <hi>stirred</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 12.</note> 
                           <hi>up the People against him.</hi> And <hi>Herod</hi> went the same way when he had killed St. <hi>James:</hi> Yet he would not venture on St. <hi>Peter,</hi> till he found how the other <hi>Pleased the People.</hi> But take heed of having <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Act.</hi> 12. 3.</note> your <hi>Hands full of Blood;</hi> for there is a time, (best known to himself) <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Esa.</hi> 1. 15.</note> when God (above other Sins) makes Inquisition for Blood; and when that Inquisition is on foot the Psalmist tells us, <hi>that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 9. 12.</note> (that's not all) <hi>he remembers and forgets not the Complaint of the Poor.</hi> That is, whose Blood is shed by Oppression, ver. 9. Take heed of this: <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of the Living</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 31.</note> 
                           <hi>God;</hi> but then especially, when he is <hi>making Inquisition for Blood.</hi> And (with my Prayers to avert it) I do heartily desire this City to remember the Prophesie that is expressed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 26. 15.</p>
                        <p>The Third Particular is the Poor Church of <hi>England.</hi> It hath Flourished, and been a shelter to other Neighbouring Churches, when Storms have Driven upon them. But, alas! now it is in a Storm it self; and God only knows whether, or how it shall get out. And (which is worse than the Storm from without) it is become like an Oak cleft to Shivers with Wedges made out of it's own Body, and at every Cleft Profaneness and Irreligion is entring in, while (as <hi>Prosper</hi> speaks in his Second Book <hi>de Contemptu Vitae,</hi> cap. 4.) <hi>Men that introduce Profaneness, are Cloaked over with the Name,</hi> Religionis imaginariae, <hi>of Imaginary Religion.</hi> For we have lost the Substance, and dwell too much in Opinion: And that Church, which all the Jesuites Machinations could not Ruine, is fallen into Danger by her own.</p>
                        <p>The last Particular (for I am not willing to be too long) is my self. I was Born and Baptized in the Bosom of the Church of <hi>England</hi> Established by Law; in that profession I have ever since lived, and in that I come now to Die. This is no time to dissemble with God,
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:54614:237"/>
least of all in matters of Religion: And therefore I desire it may be remembred, I have always lived in the Protestant Religion esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in <hi>England,</hi> and in that I come now to Die. What Clamours and Slanders I have endured for labouring to keep an Uniformity in the external Service of God, according to the Doctrine and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church, all Men know, and I have abundantly felt.</p>
                        <p>Now at last I am Accused of <hi>High-Treason</hi> in Parliament, a Crime which my Soul ever abhorred. This <hi>Treason</hi> was Charged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of two Parts, <hi>An Endeavour to subvert the Laws of the Land,</hi> and a like <hi>Endeavour to overthrow the true Protestant Religion Established by Law.</hi> Besides my Answers to the several Charges, I protested my Innocency in both Houses. It was said, <hi>Prisoners Protestations at the Bar, must not be taken.</hi> I can bring no Witness of my Heart, and the Intentions thereof; therefore I must come to my Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not at the Bar; but my Protestation at this Hour and Instant of my Death; in which I hope all Men will be such Charitable Christians, as not to think I would Die and Dissemble, being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly to give God an Account for the Truth of it. I do therefore here in the Presence of God and his Holy Angels take it upon my Death, that I never Endeavoured the subversion of Law or Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And I desire you all to remember this Protest of mine for my Innocency in this, and from all Treasons whatsoever. I have been Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused likewise as an Enemy to Parliaments: No; I understand them, and the Benefit that comes by them too well to be so. But I did mislike the Misgovernments of some Parliaments, many ways, and I had good Reason for it. For <hi>Corruptio Optimi est Pessima,</hi> there is no Corruption in the World, so bad as that which is of the Best Thing within it self; for the better the thing is in Nature, the worse it is Corrupted. And that being the Highest Court, over which no other hath Jurisdiction, when it is misinformed or misgoverned, the Subject is left without all Remedy. But I have done: I forgive all the World, all and every of those Bitter Enemies which have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted me; and humbly desire to be forgiven of God First, and then of every Man, whether I have offended him or not; if he do but conceive that I have. Lord do thou forgive me, and I beg forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of him. And so I heartily desire you to joyn in Prayer  with me.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Which said, with a distinct and audible Voice he Prayed as followeth.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>O Eternal God and Merciful Father, look down upon me in Mercy, in the Riches and fulness of all thy Mercies look down upon me: But not till thou hast nailed my Sins to the Cross of Christ, not till thou hast bathed me in the Blood of Christ, not till I have hid my self in the Wounds of Christ, that so the Punishment due unto my Sins may pass over me. And since thou art pleased to try me to the utmost, I humbly beseech thee, give me now in this great Instant, full Patience, proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Comfort, and a Heart ready to Die for thine Honour, the King's Happiness, and the Churches Preservation. And my Zeal to this (far from Arrogancy be it spoken) is all the Sin (Humane Frailty excepted, and all the Incidents thereunto) which is yet known to me in this Particular for which I now come to suffer; I say in this Particular
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:54614:237"/>
of Treason. But otherwise my Sins are many and great: Lord Pardon them all, and those especially (whatever they are) which have drawn down this present Judgment upon me. And when thou hast given me strength to bear it, do with me as seems best in thine own Eyes: And carry me through Death, that I may look upon it in what Visage soever it shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me. <hi>Amen.</hi> And that there may be a stop of this Issue of Blood in this more than miserable Kingdom, (I shall desire that I may Pray for the People too, as well as for my self) O Lord I beseech thee give Grace of Repentance to all Blood-Thirsty People; but if they will not Repent, O Lord confound all their Devices, defeat and frustrate all their Designs and Endeavours upon them, which are, or shall be contrary to the Glory of thy Great Name, the Truth and Sincerity of Religion, the Establishment of the King and his Posterity after him in their just Rights and Priviledges, the Honour and Conservation of Parliaments in their just Power, the Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this poor Church in her Truth, Peace and Patrimony, and the settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this distracted and distressed People under their Ancient Laws, and in their Native Liberty. And when thou hast done all this in meer Mercy to them, O Lord fill their Hearts with Thankfulness, and with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Dutiful Obedience to thee and thy Commandments all their Days. <hi>Amen,</hi> Lord <hi>Jesu, Amen.</hi> And receive my Soul into thy Bosom, <hi>Amen.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Our Father which art in Heaven, &amp;c.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>The Speech and Prayer being ended, he gave the Paper which he read into the Hands of <hi>Stern</hi> his Chaplain, permitted to Attend him in his last Extremity: Whom he desired to Communicate it to his other Chaplains, that they might see in what manner he left this World; and so Prayed God to shew his Blessings and Mercies on them. And taking notice that one <hi>Hind</hi> had employed himself in writing the Words of his Speech as it came from his Mouth, he desired him not to do him wrong in Publishing a False or Imperfect Copy. This done, he next applied himself to the Fatal Block, as to the Haven of his Rest. But finding the way full of People, who had placed themselves upon the Theatre to behold the Tragedy, he desired he might have room to Die, beseeching them to let him have <hi>an end of his Miseries which he had endured very long.</hi> All which he did with so serene and calm a Mind, as if he rather had been taking order for a Noble-Man's Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, than making way for his own. Being come near the Block, he put off his Doublet, and used some Words to this Effect, <hi>God's Will be done; I am willing to go out of this World, none can be more willing to send me.</hi> And seeing through the Chinks of the Boards, that some People were got under the Scaffold about the very Place where the Block was seated, he called to the Officer for some Dust to stop them, or to remove the People thence, saying, It was no part of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires that his Blood should fall upon the Heads of the People. Never did Man put off Mortality with a Better Courage, nor look upon his Bloody and Malicious Enemies with more Christian Charity. And thus far he was on his way toward Paradise, with such a Primitive Magnanimity, as Equalled if not Exceeded the Example of the
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:54614:238"/>
Ancient Martyrs, when he was somewhat interrupted by one of those who had placed himself on the Scaffold, not otherwise worthy to be Named, but as a Firebrand brought from <hi>Ireland</hi> to inflame this <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sir</hi> John Clot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy.</note> Kingdom. Who finding that the Mockings and Revilings of Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous People, had no power to move him, or sharpen him into any discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or shew of Passion, would needs put in and try what he could do with his Spunge and Vinegar; and stepping to him near the Block, he would needs propound unto him some impertinent Questions, not so much out of a desire to learn any thing of him, but with the same purpose as was found in the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> in propounding Questions to our <hi>Saviour;</hi> that is to say, either to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap him in his Answers, or otherwise, to expose him to some disadvantage with the standers by. Two of the Questions he made Answer to, with all Christian Meekness. The first Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion was, <hi>What was the Comfortablest Saying which a Dying Man would have in his Mouth?</hi> To which he Meekly made Answer, <hi>Cupio dissolvi &amp; esse cum Christo.</hi> Being asked again, <hi>What was the fittest Speech a Man could use to express his Confidence and Assurance?</hi> He answered with the same Spirit of Meekness, That <hi>such Assurance was to be found within, and that no words were able to express it rightly.</hi> But this not satisfying this Busie Man, (who aimed at something else, as is probable, than such satisfaction) unless he gave some Word or Place of Scripture, whereupon such Assurance might be truly founded; he used some words to this effect, That <hi>it was the Word of God concerning Christ, and his dying for us.</hi> But then finding that there was like to be no end of the Troublesom Gentleman, he turned away from him, applying himself directly to the Executioner, as the Gentler and Discreeter Person. Putting some Money into his Hand, he said unto him, without the least distemper or change of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <hi>Here, Honest Friend, God forgive thee and I do, and do thy Office upon me with Mercy.</hi> And having given him a Sign when the Blow should come, he kneeled down upon his Knees, and Prayed as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth; <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Lord I am coming as fast as I can; I know I must pass through the shadow of Death, before I can come to see thee; but it is but <hi>Umbra Mortis,</hi> a meer shadow of Death, a little darkness upon Nature; but thou by thy Merits and Passion hast broke through the Jaws of Death. <note n="*" place="margin">So Lord, <hi>Hind's</hi> Copy.</note> The Lord receive my Soul, and have Mercy upon me, and bless this Kingdom with Peace and Plenty, and with Brotherly Love and Charity, that there may not be this effusion of Christian Blood amongst them, for <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> his sake, if it be thy will.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Then laying his Head upon the Block, and praying silently to himself, he said aloud, <hi>Lord receive my Soul;</hi> which was the Signal given to the Executioner; who very dexterously did his Office, and took off his Head at a blow, his Soul ascending on the Wings of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels into <hi>Abraham's</hi> Bosom, and leaving his Body on the Scaffold to the care of Men. And if the Bodies of us Men be capable of any Happiness in the Grave, he had as great a share therein as he could desire, his Body being accompanied to the Earth with great Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:54614:238" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of People, whom Love, or Curiosity, or remorse of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, had drawn together purposely to perform that Office, and decently Interred in the Church of <hi>Alhallow Barking,</hi> (a Church of his own Patronage and Jurisdiction) according to the Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> In which it may be noted as a thing remarkable, That being whilst he Lived, the greatest Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book</hi> here by Law Established, he had the Honour being Dead, to be Buried by the Form therein prescribed, after it had been long disused, and almost reprobated in most Churches of <hi>London.</hi>

                     <p>I <hi>William Laud,</hi> by God's great Mercy and Goodness, Lord Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> being in perfect Health, (tho' at this time a Prisoner in the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> God knows for what) in due and serious Consideration of Humane Frailty, do hereby Make, Ordain and Declare, this my Last <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Testament,</hi> in Manner and Form following.</p>
                     <p>And First, in all Humility and Devotion of a contrite Heart, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> beg of God Pardon and Remission of all my Sins, for and through the Merits and Mediation of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> my alone Saviour. And though I have been a most Prodigal Son; yet my hope is in <hi>Christ,</hi> that for his sake, God (my most merciful Creator) will not cast off the Bowels of Compassion of a Father. <hi>Amen,</hi> Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi> In this Hope and Confidence I render up my Soul with Comfort, into the Mercies of God the Father, through the Merits of God the Son, in the Love of God the Holy Ghost: And I humbly pray that most Blessed and Glorious Trinity, One God, to prepare me in that Hour of Dissolution, and to make me wait every Moment when my Changing shall come, and in my Change, to receive me to that Rest which he <note n="*" place="margin">hath.</note> prepared for all them that Love and Fear his Name. So, <hi>Amen:</hi> Lord <hi>Jesu, Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whomsoever I have in the least degree Offended, I heartily ask God and him Forgiveness. And whosoever hath Offended me, I pray God forgive them, and I do. And I hope and pray, that God will forgive me my many Great and Grievous Transgressions against him. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For my Faith, I Die as I have Lived, in the True Orthodox Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Catholick Faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> foreshewed by the Prophets, and Preached to the World by <hi>Christ</hi> himself, his Blessed Apostles and their Successors; and a True Member of his Catholick Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Communion of a Living part thereof, the present Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it stands Established by Law.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I leave my Body to the Earth, whence it was taken, in full assurance of the Resurrection of it from the Grave at the last day. This Resurrection I constantly believe my Dear Saviour <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> will make happy unto me his poor and weary Servant. And for my Burial, tho' I stand not much upon the place, yet if it conveniently may be, I desire to be Buried in the Chappel of St. <hi>John Baptist's</hi> College in <hi>Oxford,</hi> underneath the Altar or Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-Table there. And should I be so unhappy as to die a Prisoner; yet my earnest desire is, I may not be buried in the <hi>Tower.</hi> But wheresoever my Burial shall be, I will have it private, that it may not waste any of the poor Means which I leave behind me to better Uses.</p>

Thirdly, For my Worldly Estate, I Will, that my Debts be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently paid, which at this time I praise God are very small. Then for St: <hi>Paul's</hi> Church, it grieves me to see it at such a stand. And tho' I have, besides my pains, given largely towards it, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs thereof; yet I leave it a Blessing of 800 <hi>l.</hi> which will be truly paid in for that Work, if ever it go on, while the Party trusted with it lives. But my Executors are not charged with this; 'tis in safe, but other Hands.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> I take the boldness to give to my Dread and Dear Soveraign King <hi>Charles</hi> (whom God bless) 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and I do forgive him the Debt, which he owes me, being 2000 <hi>l.</hi> and require, that the Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies for it be delivered up.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> I give to St: <hi>John's</hi> College in <hi>Oxford,</hi> where I was bred, all my Chappel-Plate, gilt or party-gilt: All my Chappel-Furniture, all such Books as I have in my Study at the time of my Death, which they have not in their Library, and 500 <hi>l.</hi> in Money, to be laid out upon Lands. And I Will, that the Rent of it shall be equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to every Fellow and Scholar alike, upon the 17th: day of <hi>October,:</hi> every fourth Year. Something else I have done for them already, according to my Ability: And God's everlasting Blessing be upon that Place and that Society for ever— I give to the Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <hi>George</hi> Lord Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> his Grace, my Chalice and Patin of Gold; and these I desire the young Duke to accept, and use in his Chappel, as the Memorial of him who had a Faithful Heart to love, and the Honour to be beloved of his Father. So God bless him with wise and good Counsels, and a Heart to follow them.</p>
                     <p>By Father and Mother, I never had Brother nor Sister; but by my Mother many. They were all Ancient to me, and are Dead; but I give to their Children as followeth.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> I give to so many of my Servants, as did continue my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants till the time that the Storm fell on me, as followeth.</p>
                     <p>—Among the rest, to Mr: <hi>Cobb</hi> my Organ that is at <hi>Croydon,</hi> my Harp, my Chest of Viols, and the Harpsichon that is at <hi>Lambeth.</hi>

                     <p>The remainder of my Estate, above that which is given, or shall be added to this my Will, I charge my Executor (as he will Answer me at the Bar of <hi>Christ</hi>) that he lay out upon Land, as far as it will
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:54614:240"/>
go; and then settle it by some sure course in Law to such Uses, and under the same Conditions, as I have setled my Land at <hi>Bray</hi> upon the Town of <hi>Reading.</hi>

If it rise to less; that there be an even abatement to all these places. But if it purchase more, (as, <hi>says he,</hi> it needs must, if I be well dealt with) all above 200 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> he gives to Dr: <hi>Baily,</hi> and his Son <hi>William</hi> after him, and his Heirs for ever.— He held a Lease of <hi>Barton-Farm</hi> (near <hi>Winchester</hi>) of the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral Church of <hi>Winchester,</hi> taken in his Servant <hi>Richard Cobb's</hi> Name, Rent 370 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> of which, he gives (during the Lease) 50 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> to the City of <hi>Winchester,</hi> for the binding out of Apprentices; the rest to several Nephews and Servants. And if (<hi>says he</hi>) the Cathedral Church of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> be: suffered to enjoy its Lands, I leave the power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing this Lease to Dr: <hi>Richard Baily,</hi> he paying Mr: <hi>Rich.

Likewise, I give him my Barge, and Furniture to it. As for the Pictures in the Gallery at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> I leave them to Succession; as well those that I found there, as those which I have added. But in case the Arch-Bishoprick be dissolved, (as 'tis threatned) then I Will, that my Executor add the Organ, the Barge, and such Pictures as are mine, to my Estate; that is, if they escape Plundering.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> I do lay upon Dr: <hi>Baily</hi> above Named, the charge of all my Papers and Paper-Books, if they can escape the Violence of the Time. And I give him an <hi>English</hi> Bible in <hi>4to,</hi> cover'd with Murry-leather, in which are some brief <hi>Notes</hi> upon the Liturgy; and a <hi>Note-Book</hi> in <hi>Folio,</hi> in which is my Catalogue of Books in relation to my course of Study, and my <hi>Directory</hi> to almost all my other Papers and Books: All which Papers and Paper-Books I give him also. But with this Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that he burn all that he thinks not fit to use himself, that my Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness (whatever it be) be not any Man's Scorn; and my Diligence, I am sure, cannot.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Then he makes Dr: <hi>Baily</hi> his sole Executor, and gives him 200 <hi>l.</hi> for his pains. But adds,— If he shall not be Living at the time of my Death, or shall die before he make due <hi>Probat</hi> of

                     </q>
                     <p>Thus I forgive all the World, and heartily desire forgiveness of God and the World: And so again commend and commit my Soul into the Hands of God the Father who gave it, in the Merits and Mercies of my Blessed Saviour <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> who Redeemed it, and in the Peace and Comfort of the Holy Ghost who Blessed it; and in the Truth and Unity of his Holy Catholick Church, and in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it yet stands Established by Law.</p>
                     <p>I most willingly leave the World, being weary at the very Heart of the Vanities of it, and of my own Sins, many and great, and of the grievous Distractions of the Church of <hi>Christ</hi> almost in all parts of <hi>Christendom:</hi> Which Distractions God in his good time make up, who well knows upon what many of them are grounded.</p>
                     <p>For the Mony to bear the Charge of those Legacies expressed in my <hi>Will,</hi> and other Intendments; I have, for fear of the present Storm, committed it to honest, and (I trust in God) safe Hands. And I doubt not, but they will deliver the Mony in their several Custodies to my Executor for the Uses expressed. But I forbear to Name them; lest the same Storm should fall on them, which hath driven me out of all I have considerable in my own Possession, &amp;c. <hi>Jan:</hi> 13: <hi>Anno:</hi> 1643.</p>

                        <p>The Doctrine it self is so full of Danger, that it works strongly, both upon the Learned and Unlearned, to the Scandal of Religion, and the Perverting of Truth. For the unlearned First, how it works upon them by whole Countries together, you may see by what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in <hi>Asturia, Cantabria, Galaecia;</hi> no small parts of <hi>Spain.</hi> For there the <hi>People</hi> (so he <note n="*" place="margin">Hieron. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, <hi>in Summa, p.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> tells me that was an Eye-Witness, and that since the <hi>Council of Trent) are so addicted to their Worm-eaten and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Images, that when the Bishops commanded New, and Handsomer Images to be set up in their rooms, the poor People cryed for their Old, would not look up to their New, as if they did not represent the same thing.</hi> And it works upon the Learned too, more than it should. For it wrought so far upon <hi>Lamas</hi> himself, who bemoaned the former pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, as that he delivers this Doctrine, <hi>That the Images of Christ, the Blessed Virgin, and the Saints, are not to be Worshiped, as if there were any Divinity in the Images, as they are Material things made by Art; But only as they represent Christ and the Saints; for else it were Idolatry.</hi>
                           <pb n="459" facs="tcp:54614:241"/>
So then belike, according to the Divinity of this Casuist, a Man may Worship Images, and ask of them, and put his Trust in them, <hi>as they represent Christ and the Saints:</hi> For so there is <hi>Divinity</hi> in them, though not as things, yet as Representers. And what I pray did, or could any <hi>Pagan-Priest</hi> say more than this? For the Proposition resolved is this; <hi>The Images of Christ and the Saints, as they represent their Exemplars, have Deity or Divinity in them.</hi> And now I pray, <hi>A. C.</hi> do you be Judge, whether this Proposition do not teach Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? And whether the Modern Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be not grown too like to <hi>Paganism</hi> in this Point? For my own part, I heartily wish it were not. And that Men of Learning would not strain their Wits to spoil the Truth, and rent the Peace of the Church of Christ, by such Dangerous, such Superstitious Vanities. For better they are not; but they may be worse. Nay, these and their like have given so great a Scandal among us, to some ignorant, though (I presume) well-meaning Men, that they are afraid to Testifie their Duty to God, even in his own House, by any outward Gesture at all. Insomuch, that those very Ceremonies, which by the Judgment of Godly and Learned Men, have now long continued in the Practice of the Church, suffer hard Measure for the <hi>Romish Superstitions</hi> sake.</p>

But most manifest it is, that <hi>quod legerim,</hi> for ought I have read, will not serve <hi>Bellarmin</hi> to excuse him. For he himself, but in the very Chapter going before, quotes four places out of <hi>Calvin,</hi> in which he says expresly, That we receive in the Sacrament the Body and the Blood of Christ <hi>verè,</hi> truly. So <hi>Calvin</hi> says it four times, and <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> quotes the places; and yet he says in the very next Chapter, <hi>That never any Protestants said so, to his Reading.</hi> And for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nothing is more plain, than that it believes and teaches the true and real presence of Christ in the Eucharist.</p>

For I am confident such Truth as that, would soon either command Peace, or confound Peace-Breakers. But is there no Superstition in Adoration of Images? None in Invocation of Saints? None in Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Sacrament? Is there no Errour in breaking Christ's own Institution of the Sacrament, by giving it but in one kind? None about Purgatory? About Common-Prayer in an unknown Tongue none? These and many more, are in the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, (if you will needs call it so) and 'tis no hard work to prove every of these to be Errour, or Superstition, or both.</p>

                        <p>For a Church may hold the Fundamental Point Literally, and as long as it stays there, be without controul; and yet Err grosly, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously, nay, damnably, in the Exposition of it. And this is the Church of <hi>Rome's</hi> Case. For most true it is, it hath in all Ages maintained the Faith unchanged in the expression of the <hi>Articles</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: But it hath in the Exposition both of Creeds and Councils, quite changed and lost the Sense and the Meaning of some of them. So the Faith is in many things changed, both for Life and Belief, and yet seems the same. Now that which deceives the World is, that because the Bark is the same, Men think this old decayed Tree is as sound as it was at first, and not weather-beaten in any Age. But when they can make me believe that Painting is true Beauty, I'll believe too, that <hi>Rome</hi> is not only Sound, but Beautiful.</p>

                        <p>For the Church may import in our Language, <hi>The only True Church;</hi> and perhaps, (as some of you seem to make it) the Root and the Ground of the Catholik. And this I never did grant of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, nor ever mean to do. But <hi>a Church</hi> can imply no more, than that it is a Member of the whole. And this I never did, nor ever will deny, if it fall not absolutely away from Christ. That it is <hi>a True Church,</hi> I granted also; but not a <hi>Right,</hi> as you impose upon me. For <hi>Ens</hi> and <hi>Verum,</hi> Being and True, are convertible one with another; and every thing that hath a Being, is truly that Being
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:54614:242"/>
which it is, in truth of Substance. But this Word <hi>Right</hi> is not so used; but it is referred more properly to perfection in Conditions: And in this Sense, every thing that hath a true and real Being, is not by and by Right in the Conditions of it. A Man that is most Dishonest, and Unworthy the Name, a very Thief (if you will) is a True Man, in the Verity of his Essence, as he is a Creature Endued with Reason; for this none can steal from him, nor he from himself; but Death. But he is not therefore a Right, or an Upright Man. And a Church that is exceeding Corrupt, both in Manners and Doctrine, and so a Dishonour to the Name, is yet a True Church in the verity of Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, as a Church is a Company of Men, which profess the Faith of Christ, and are Baptized into his Name; but yet it is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Right Church, either in Doctrine or Manners. It may be you meant cunningly to slip in this Word <hi>Right,</hi> that I might at unawares grant it Orthodox: But I was not so to be caught. For I know well, that Orthodox Christians are <hi>Keepers of Integrity,</hi> (so St. <hi>Augustin</hi>) and <note place="margin">Integritatis Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodes, &amp; Recta sectantes. <hi>De vera Relig.</hi> c. <hi>5.</hi>

                  <head>THE ANSWER OF THE <hi>Most Reverend Father in God,</hi> William <hi>Lord Arch-Bishop of</hi> Canterbury, TO THE SPEECH OF THE <hi>Lord</hi> Say <hi>and</hi> Seal, <hi>touching the</hi> Liturgy.</head>
                  <q>
                     <p>The Speech begins thus,</p>
                     <p>MY Lords, I have waited to find you free from greater Busines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; that I might crave leave to speak of something that concerns my self. And this I have the more desired, since my Lord of <hi>Canterbury's</hi> last Speech; who expressing his Troubles, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the Misery of his Condition, and of the Condition of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (for he would needs join them together, which I think he may, as the Cause and the Effect, for the Miseries of the Church have certainly risen from him) he insisted much upon this: That these Troubles had befallen him through the Malice of two Parties, the <hi>Papists</hi> and the <hi>Sectaries,</hi> and by those he said the Church was greatly afflicted.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>MY Lords, and all Christian Readers, <hi>those great Businesses</hi> which my Lord speaks of, are now ended; and I hope as you are free from <hi>Business,</hi> so you will be free <hi>from Prejudice,</hi> while I also crave leave to speak something concerning my self. And this I also have the more desired, since I saw this Honourable Lord had put his Speech <hi>in Print,</hi> which I find as much, if not more against me, than for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. This Speech was not put in Print, till near six Months after it was Spoken; and I conceive was Printed then to renew the Business, and to whet the Malice of those <hi>Sectaries</hi> against me. 'Tis true, that after I was Impeached by <hi>the House of Commons</hi> for <hi>High Treason,</hi>
                     <pb n="471" facs="tcp:54614:247"/>
there came no <hi>Articles</hi> up against me, in full Ten Weeks after; then they came up in <hi>Generals</hi> only; and I was called to the House to hear them, on Friday <hi>February</hi> the 26th <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Now by these <hi>Articles</hi> I found, that there was <hi>great,</hi> but (I humbly praise God for it) cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Jealousie of me in point of <hi>Religion.</hi> This made me labour more to clear my self from that, than from any thing else objected against me, as ever hating to seem other in Religion than what I truly and really am. For of all <hi>Simulations</hi> or <hi>Dissimulations,</hi> that is the basest, when a Man for poor Temporary fading ends, shall shift his <hi>Religion</hi> or his <hi>Judgment</hi> concerning it, with the Time, if not with the Tide: As if at all times he had somewhat to seek before he would express: Whereas it is most true, which St. <hi>Hilary</hi> speaks in Matter of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Non opus est intervallo aliquo inter Cor &amp; Os; There's no need of a</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">St. <hi>Hilary</hi> l. <hi>10.</hi> de Trin. p. <hi>165.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>distance between the Heart and the Mouth; as if a Man were to bethink him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of some faithless ambiguity, before he would speak that which belonged to the Profession of his Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, if seeing <hi>my self</hi> under so great a pressure, <hi>and the Church of England</hi> so hard lay'd at, as then it was, I did bewail the Condition of both, I think I did what became me. And I hope I offended no Man in <hi>joyning our Conditions together.</hi> And whereas this Honourable Lord thinks, <hi>that I might well joyn them, as the Cause and the Effect:</hi> I think so too my self, but in another Sense.</p>
                  <p>For his Lordship says too <hi>peremptorily,</hi> that the Miseries of the Church <hi>have certainly risen from me.</hi> No <hi>certainly:</hi> The Miseries of this Church have proceeded from the <hi>Separatists,</hi> and from such as for private at least, if not for worse ends, have countenanced them and their strange Proceedings against <hi>the Government</hi> and <hi>Governours of the Church.</hi> And this so long, till they brought <hi>the Church's Condition</hi> (which flourished before) to be the Cause of <hi>my Condition, such as it now is.</hi> And I fell into this Condition, by labouring by all good Means to uphold <hi>the Church of England</hi> from that Misery, into which I fear it is now falling.</p>
                  <p>And I doubt not, but God will open the Eyes of all Good Men, to see clearly in time, that this was the Cause which laid both me and this <hi>Church</hi> so low; and not any <hi>Actions,</hi> much less <hi>Practices</hi> of mine. This being so, if <hi>I insisted much upon this, that these Troubles have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen me through the Malice of two Parties, the Papists and the Sectaries</hi> (as this Honourable Lord says I did) I had great Reason so to do. For certainly, <hi>the Church of England</hi> is greatly afflicted <hi>by them;</hi> and I pray God, in the end it be not torn in pieces between them. That which I then said in my sudden Speech to the Lords to this Particular, was as follows:
<q>
                        <p>I am very Unfortunate in this Business, between the Malignity of two Parties against me, <hi>the Papist</hi> and <hi>the Separatist.</hi> And shall I suffer on both sides at once? Shall I be accounted a deadly Enemy to <hi>the Papist,</hi> as I am reputed by them both at Home and Abroad; and in the mean time, accused for no less than Treason, for favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and complying with them? Well: If I do suffer; 'tis but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Truth</hi> usually lyes between two sides, and is beaten on both sides (as the poor <hi>Church of England</hi> is at this day by these Factions:) But in this and all things else, and in despight of Malice, Truth shall
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:54614:248"/>
either be my Protection from Suffering, or my Comfort while I suffer; and by God's gracious Assistance, I shall never depart from it, but continue at the Apostle's Ward; <hi>Nihil possum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi>

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This, or to this effect, I then spake, and I hope, without any Offence; sure I am, without reflecting upon any particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Yet my Lord seems to think otherwise: For he says,</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>How far this Man will extend this Word <hi>Sectary,</hi> and whom he will comprehend under it, I know not; but I have some cause to fear, that I may lie under some Misapprehension in respect of Matters of this nature; which how far it concerns him, your Lordships will perceive by what I shall say.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>My Lord it seems, <hi>knows not how far I will extend the Word</hi> Sectary: Truly, no farther than the <hi>Church of Christ</hi> extended it, ever since Sects and Schisms broke in upon it, to help dispoil it of Peace and Unity. And a <hi>Sectary</hi> is he . . . . . <note place="margin">The Definition or Description of a <hi>Sectary</hi> is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. <hi>H.

                  </p>
                  <p>The next thing which my Lord knows not, is, <hi>Whom I will compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend under that Name;</hi> and that his Lordship may easily know. For I comprehend none under it, but such as <hi>divide from the Church,</hi> and either <hi>make</hi> or <hi>follow</hi> a Breach, where no just cause is given by the Church; or where though cause were given, <hi>Ways of Division</hi> are preferr'd before <hi>Ways of Peace.</hi> But that which troubles my Lord about these things, which he professes he knows not, is, That <hi>he hath some cause to fear</hi> (for so he confesses) <hi>that he may lie under some Misapprehensions in respect of Matters of this nature.</hi> And this I think may trouble him indeed: For there's cause enough, why he should fear, that he may lie under, not <hi>Misapprehensions,</hi> but very just <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions,</hi> in respect of Matters of this nature; since 'tis manifest, that he separates himself, as <hi>Sectaries</hi> use to do, from the <hi>Common Prayers of the Church:</hi> And those such, as were composed by such Bishops and other Divines, as suffered, some of them to <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> for the Truth of <hi>CHRIST:</hi> And those such also, as were a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, under the prosperous Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by <hi>Act of Parliament.</hi> So that his Lordship separating himself from those Prayers, which were made by the <hi>One,</hi> and confirmed by the <hi>Other,</hi> must needs be apprehended as a <hi>Sectary;</hi> whether you look upon <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State.</hi> But my Lord tells you, <hi>That you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by that which he shall say, how far this concerns me.</hi> And therefore I pray you observe it diligently; for I cannot yet conceive how any thing else that belongs to a <hi>Sectary,</hi> can concern me; or any thing else, much, which his Lordship can say against me.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>My Lord of <hi>Canterbury!</hi> A Man of mean Birth, Bred up in a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege (and that too frequently falls out to be in a Faction) whose nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Comprehension extended it self no farther, than to carry on a Side in a College, or canvas for a Proctor's Place in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity.</p>

This concerns me indeed, and very nearly; for I see his Lordship resolves to rake me up from my very <hi>Birth;</hi> a way unusual for Men well-bred, and little beseeming a <hi>Person of Honour;</hi> especially thus to insult upon a <hi>Fallen Fortune.</hi> But yet it concerns me not in any rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a <hi>Sectary,</hi> unless his Lordship would possess the World that I was bred in <hi>Faction,</hi> and so like enough to prove one. But how my Lord is mistaken in this, will plainly appear. First then, 'tis true, I am a Man of ordinary, but very honest Birth; and the Memory of my <hi>Parents</hi> savours very well to this day, in the Town in <hi>Reading,</hi> where I was born. Nor was I so meanly born, as perhaps my Lord would insinuate; for my Father had born all Offices in the Town, save the <hi>Mayoralty.</hi> And my immediate Predecessor (whom I am sure my Lord himself accounted very worthy of his Place) was as meanly born as my self, <hi>his Father</hi> being of the same Trade in <hi>Guilford,</hi> that <hi>mine</hi> was of in <hi>Reading.</hi> But all this of my Birth might well have been spared; for my Lord knows well enough, <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>And that which follows in the <hi>Satyrist.</hi> And had my Birth been meaner than it was, that would not have impaired me among Men of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. And howsoever, this Advantage I have; I have done Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to my <hi>Birth;</hi> which every Man hath not done, that hath had an <hi>Honourable Descent.</hi> To my <hi>Birth</hi> his Lordship adds, <hi>That I was bred up in a College.</hi> That's true. But 'tis as true, that his Lordship was bred up in a College also, and of the same <hi>Vniversity.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so far he speaks as much against Himself, as me. But I hope, he intends not to charge being bred in a <hi>College</hi> as a Fault upon either of us. And though <hi>it too frequently falls out, that Colleges be in a Faction</hi> (for that also is too truly observed by his Lordship) yet that is no Fault in any Man, who neither <hi>Causes</hi> nor <hi>Nourishes</hi> the Faction. But that which his Lordship charges next upon me, is both a Weakness, and a Fault, if true. <hi>Weakness,</hi> That <hi>my Comprehensions are narrow.</hi> And a <hi>Fault,</hi> because <hi>they extended no farther than to carry on a Side in the College, or a canvas for a Proctor's Place in the Vniversity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Weakness</hi> first: My <hi>Comprehensions, as narrow as they are,</hi> are yet <hi>as large</hi> as God hath been pleased to make them, and <hi>as large</hi> as my hard Study, accompanied with his <hi>Grace,</hi> hath been able to stretch them. And so large I am sure they are; as that I have ever looked carefully upon the whole Catholick Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> spread upon the Face of the whole Earth.</p>
                  <p>And therefore certainly my <hi>Comprehensions are not so narrow</hi> as theirs, whose largest cannot, or will not, look upon one entire <hi>National Church;</hi> nay, a <hi>Parochial</hi> is too big for them, and a <hi>Conventicle</hi> big enough. Nor did my <hi>narrow Comprehensions</hi> ever reject that great Body, the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> out of the <hi>Creed,</hi> as some of late have done, whose <hi>Comprehensions</hi> are not, for all that, censured by his Lordship for their <hi>Narrowness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="474" facs="tcp:54614:249"/>
Next for the Fault: That's twofold. First, <hi>My Comprehensions went no farther</hi> (says my Lord) <hi>than to carry on a Side in a College.</hi> Here my Lord is either utterly mistaken, or, which is worse, in a wilful Errour. For while I was Fellow of St. <hi>John Baptist's</hi> College, where I was bred, it is well known I never made nor held up any Side. Indeed, when I was Chosen <hi>President</hi> of that College, there was a bitter Faction both Raised and Countenanced against me (I will forbear to relate how and by whom;) But this is certain, I made no Party then: For Four being in Nomination for that <hi>Headship,</hi> I lay then so sick at <hi>London,</hi> that I was neither able to go down, nor so much as write to my Friends about it. yet after much Tumble, a major part of the Votes made choice of me. Thus I was chosen <hi>Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, May</hi> 10. 1611. After this, my Election was quarrelled at, and great means made against me; insomuch that the most Gracious King, King <hi>James,</hi> sate to hear the Cause Himself, for the space of full three Hours, <hi>Aug.</hi> 28. at <hi>Tichburn</hi> in <hi>Hampshire,</hi> as he returned out of the Western Progress. Upon this Hearing, his Majesty approved my Election, and commanded my Settlement; which was done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> following. But the Faction in the College finding such Props above, as they had, continued very eager and bitter against me. The Audit of the College for the Year's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts, and Choice of New Officers, followed in <hi>November:</hi> There so God Blessed me with Patience and Moderation in the Choice of all Offices, that I made all quiet in the College. And for all the <hi>Narrowness of my Comprehensions,</hi> I Govern'd that <hi>College</hi> in Peace, without so much as the shew of a Faction, all my Time, which was near upon <hi>Eleven Years.</hi> And the Truth of all this is notoriously known, and many yet living of great Worth in the Church, able and ready to avow it. And this, I hope, was not to lead on a Side.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, My Lord charges <hi>my narrow Comprehensions,</hi> as reaching no farther <hi>than a canvas for a Proctor's Place.</hi> I was (with Thanks to their Love that thought me Worthy) chose <hi>Proctor of the Vniversity,</hi> so soon as by <hi>Statute</hi> I was capable of it. But I never medled in the managing of the <hi>canvas</hi> for it for my self: Nor afterwards for any other, while I continued <hi>Fellow of the College.</hi> When I was chosen <hi>President,</hi> I continued so for two Years, and medled not in that Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness. And this I did, because in some things I did utterly dislike that Canvas, and the Carriage of it. At last some of the <hi>Senior Fellows</hi> came to me, and told me, That the <hi>College</hi> had been many Years without the Credit of a <hi>Proctor;</hi> and, that the <hi>Fellows</hi> began to take it ill at my hands, that I would not shew my self, and try my Credit and my Friends in that Business. Upon this, rather than I would lose the Love of my Companions, I did settle my self in an honest and fair way, to right the <hi>College</hi> as much as I could. And by God's Blessing, it succeeded beyond Expectation. But when we were at the strongest, I made this fair Offer more than once and again, That if the <hi>greater Colleges</hi> would submit to take their Turns in Order, and not seek to carry all from the <hi>lesser,</hi> we would agree to any indifferent course in <hi>Convocation,</hi> and allow the <hi>greater Colleges</hi> their
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:54614:249"/>
full proportion according to their Number. This would not be heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto; whereupon things continued some Years.</p>
                  <p>After this, by his Majesty's Grace and Favour, I was made Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of St. <hi>Davids;</hi> and after that, of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells.</hi> When I was thus gone out of the <hi>Vniversity,</hi> the Election of the <hi>Proctors</hi> grew more and more Tumultuous, till at the last the Peace of the <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity</hi> was like to be utterly broken; and the divided Parties brought up a Complaint to the <hi>Council-Table.</hi> The Lords were much troubled at it, especially the Right Honourable <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> Lord Steward, and their Honourable Chancellour. I had by that time, and by the great Grace of his <hi>Now Majesty,</hi> the Honour to be a <hi>Councellor,</hi> and was present. There I acquainted the Lords, what Offers I had made during my time in <hi>the Vniversity,</hi> which I did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive would settle all Differences, and make Peace for ever. The Lords approved the way; and after the <hi>Council</hi> was risen, my very Honourable Lord the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> desired me to put the whole Business in Writing, that he might see and consider of it. I did so: His Lordship approved of it, and sent it to the <hi>Vniversity,</hi> with all Freedom to accept or refuse, as they saw Cause. The <hi>Vniversity</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved all, only desired the addition of a Year or two more to <hi>the Circle;</hi> which would add a turn or two more, to content some of the <hi>greater Colleges.</hi> This that Honourable Lord yielded unto; and that Form of <hi>Election of their Proctors,</hi> was by unanimous Consent, made a Statute in <hi>Convocation,</hi> and hath continued the <hi>Vniversity</hi> in Peace ever since. And this is all <hi>the carrying on of a Canvas for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's place,</hi> which any Truth can challenge me withal. And it may be, my Lord is pleased to impute <hi>narrow Comprehensions</hi> to me, because my Advice inclosed the <hi>choice of the Proctors within a Circle.</hi> I am heartily sorry, I should trouble the <hi>Reader</hi> with these Passages concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my self; but my Lord forces me to it, by imputing so much Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness to me. But my Lord leaves not here, but goes on, and says worse of me:

                        <p>Being suddenly advanced to highest Places of Government in Church and State, had not his Heart enlarged by the Enlargement of his Fortune; but still the maintaining of his Party was that which filled all his Thoughts; which he prosecuted with so much Violence and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerateness, that he had not an Eye to see the Consequences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the Church and State, until he had brought both into those Distractions, Danger and Dishonour, which we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>The next thing which my Lord charges me with, is, That <hi>I was suddenly advanced to highest Places of Government in Church and State.</hi> This is like the rest. And I dare say, when my Lord shall better consider of it, he will neither re-affirm nor avouch such an Untruth. <hi>Suddenly advanced!</hi> What does my Lord call <hi>Suddenly?</hi> I was Eleven Years his Majesty's Chaplain in Ordinary, before I was made a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop. I was a Bishop Twelve Years before I was preferred to be <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that <hi>Highest Place</hi> my Lord mentions. When I was made <hi>Archbishop,</hi> I was full Threescore Years of Age, within
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:54614:250"/>
less than one Month. Whereas my immediate Predecessor was not any one Month in his Majesty's Ordinary Service as Chaplain, but far from that Honourable indeed, but yet Painful and Chargeable Service, and was made Bishop of <hi>Lichfield,</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> within the compass of two Years, he being at the time of his Translation to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> but Forty nine Years of Age; and yet never Charged as a Man <hi>suddenly</hi> advanced. But my <hi>Advancement,</hi> which it seems pleased not my Lord so well as his did, was <hi>very sudden;</hi> which I leave to the impartial Reader to judge.</p>
                  <p>Next being advanced to this <hi>High Place,</hi> as my Lord calls it; (but now made low enough by his Lordship, and other of the same Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;) he says, <hi>I had not my Heart enlarged with the Enlargement of my Fortune.</hi> Sure my Lord is mistaken again. For my <hi>Heart</hi> (I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thank God for it) was <hi>enlarged</hi> every way as much as my <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> and in some things perhaps more. But it may be my Lord meant, that my Heart was not sufficiently <hi>enlarged,</hi> because I could not receive those <hi>Separatists</hi> into it (farther than to pray for them) which would not suffer the open Bosom of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to receive them; but <hi>neglecting their Father's Commandment, forsook also their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's</hi>

                  <p>Nor did <hi>I maintain any Party;</hi> but any Church-man, or any Man else that loved Order and Peace in the Church, was very welcome to me. And I leave the World to judge, by what they now see, whether I or this Lord, have practised or studied most <hi>the Maintenance and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of a Party.</hi> And as I did not maintain <hi>a Party;</hi> so much less <hi>did it fill all my Thoughts</hi> (as <hi>narrow</hi> as my Lord thinks them.) Nor did I prosecute these or any other my Thoughts, either with <hi>Violence,</hi> or <hi>Inconsiderateness.</hi> Not with <hi>Violence;</hi> for I can name many, of whose Preferment, under <hi>God and the King,</hi> I was cause, who yet went not with them, which my Lord will needs miscal <hi>my Party.</hi> Nor did I punish either more, or more severely, any that were brought before me in the <hi>Commission,</hi> than were punished for the like Offences, in any the same number of Years in my late Predecessor's Time: As will manifestly appear by the <hi>Acts of the Court.</hi> Nor with <hi>Inconsiderateness.</hi> For I have many Witnesses that <hi>mine Eye was open,</hi> and did plainly see, and as freely tell (where I then hoped there might have been remedy) what was <hi>coming both upon Church and State,</hi> though not as <hi>Consequences</hi> upon my Proceedings; and I wish with all my Heart, they were no more Consequences upon my Lord's Proceedings, than they have been upon mine.</p>
                  <p>And my Lord is extreamly mistaken, to say that <hi>I brought both into those distractions, Danger and Dishonour, with which they are now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed.</hi> For 'tis not I, that have troubled this <hi>Israel of God.</hi> For God is my Witness, I laboured nothing but the Settlement of the Decent External Worship of God among us, which what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever some other Men think, I know was sunk very low; and if in labouring this, I did err in any <hi>Circumstance</hi> (for in matter of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance I am sure I did not) that may be forgiven me <hi>for Humanity sake,</hi> which cannot free it self from Error. But that which brought all these Distractions both upon Church and State, was the bringing in of <hi>the Scots,</hi> and the keeping of them here at a vast charge, only to
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:54614:250"/>
serve Turns, and those very base ones: And to the debasing and dishonour of this whole <hi>Nation,</hi> as well as the <hi>King.</hi> And how far this Lord had his <hi>Hand</hi> or his <hi>Head</hi> in this Treacherous Business, he best knows. Sure I am, his Lordship is thought one of the chief Moulders of this <hi>Leaven of the Pharisees.</hi> But my Lord thinks himself safe enough; so he can cry me up among the Rabble, to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all. And not content with this, he insults farther upon me, as follows:
<q>
                        <p>Yet to magnifie his Moderation, presently after the breaking of the last Parliament, he told a Lord, who sits now in my sight, that if he had been a Violent Man, he wanted no occasion to shew it. For he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that the Lord <hi>Say</hi> never came to Prayers; and added, that I was in his knowledge, as great a <hi>Separatist</hi> as any was in <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What ever it was I said, was not <hi>to magnifie my Moderation.</hi> Nor do I remember, that ever I spake these words. Yet First, if any Lord will say, <hi>upon his Honour,</hi> that I did say these very Words; I will bear him <hi>and the Peerage of the Realm</hi> that Honour, as that I will submit and believe his Testimony, against my own Old now and Weak Memory. Next, upon enquiry made by some Friends of mine, I find that the Words I should speak are said to be these, <hi>that if I listed to take any advantage against this Honourable Lord, I had as much exception to him, as to any Separatist in</hi> England. These Words are neither so <hi>Bold,</hi> nor so <hi>Vncivil,</hi> as those in the Charge; and perhaps I might speak these, though I remember it not. For during the last <hi>Parliament,</hi> not so few <hi>as Ten or a Dozen several Lords,</hi> came to me of themselves, as I sat there, and complained grievously of this Lord's absenting himself from the Prayers of the Church; and some of them wondred, he was not questioned for the Scandal he gave by it. And if any of them would be so mean, as to urge me to speak by speaking Broad themselves, and then carry the Tale to this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lord; he did that, who ever he were, which I hope was not the Noblest of his Actions; and if I did say these latter Words of this great Lord, <hi>I must and do say them again;</hi> and I heartily beseech God that this Sin be not laid to my Charge, that I questioned him not, when the Times were calmer: For had I done that, I had done my Duty; and if I had not cured him, perhaps I might have prevented so much common danger to this Church, as his Lordship hath procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red since that time, both by his Example, his Counsel, and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. And for the Words, I doubt not, but he himself will be found to have made them good, before I have done examining this Speech of his Lordship. In the mean time my Lord proceeds;
<q>
                        <p>My Lords, how far he hath spit this Venom of his against me, I am not certain; but I may well fear, where it might do me greatest Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice. I shall therefore intreat your Lordships Favour and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that I may give you in these things, which so nearly concern me, a true account of my self; which I shall do with Ingenuity and Clearness, and so, as that if I satisfie not all Men, yet I hope I shall
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:54614:251"/>
make it appear, I am not such a one, as this Waspish Man was willing to make the World believe.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have <hi>spit no Venom</hi> against his Lordship, much less have I spit any thing far. For this Report, which is here called <hi>Venom,</hi> is common through the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> And I have already told you, what divers Lords said to me during <hi>the last Parliament.</hi> And that is no more, than hath been avowed unto me by very many others, and some of very good Quality; <hi>so the spreading was to me, not from me.</hi> But yet, my <hi>Lord fears, I spread it where it might do him greatest Prejudice.</hi> I know not what my Lord means by this, unless it be that I should spread it <hi>to his Majesty.</hi> And if that be his meaning; I will tell his Lordship truth, what I know therein. I was present, when I heard some <hi>Lords,</hi> more than once, tell <hi>the King,</hi> that the Lord <hi>Say</hi> was <hi>a Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi> from <hi>the Church of</hi> England, and would not come at her <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayers.</hi> And one of these Lords afterwards told me, <hi>he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it was a great danger to this Kingdom, when Noblemen should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to separate in Religion; and that his Majesty had need look to it.</hi> To this last, which was spoken to me in private (but I will depose the Truth of it) I could not but assent. And to the former I then said, I had heard as much as was then told <hi>his Majesty;</hi> but I was not certain of it. And I doubt not, but these Lords <hi>sit in his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's sight,</hi> as well as <hi>that Lord</hi> who told him the other of me: And not in <hi>his Sight</hi> only, but in his <hi>Affections</hi> also, as things go now. But however they carry it with him now, this they said of him then. Nor will I here pick a Thanks, to tell this Lord what Service I did him to his Majesty, when he was thought to be in danger enough, though I was chidden by a Great one, that stood by, for my Labour. I shall therefore intreat the <hi>Christian Reader's</hi> Favour and Patience, that having hitherto given him a most true and clear Account of that which my Lord charges me with, and doth nearly concern me; So <hi>I may proceed to the rest, which I do with all Ingenuity and Truth. And so, as that if I satisfie not all Men; yet I hope I shall make it appear,</hi> that I am not such <hi>a Waspish Man,</hi> as my Lord would fain render me to the World. But if I have been a <hi>Wasp</hi> in any <hi>Court,</hi> wherein I have had the Honour to sit; yet his Lordship should not have called me so, considering what a Hornet all men say he is in the <hi>Court of Wards,</hi> and in other Places of Business: Where he pinches so deep, that discreet Men are in a doubt, whether his Aim be to sting the <hi>Wards,</hi> or the <hi>Court</hi> it self, to Death first. For no Man can believe, 'tis for the good of the King. And if I fail in this endeavour of mine to clear my self; I must desire the Courteous Reader to ascribe it, not to my Cause, which is very good against his Lordship, but <hi>to the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowness of my Comprehensions,</hi> and my Weakness compared with his Lordships great Abilities. And now my Lord charges as hard as he can. Thus;
<q>
                        <p>For the first of these, which he Charges upon me; it may be, he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have it thought, that I would not joyn in Prayer with your Lordships, but refused such a Communion; which is altogether false. For I should most willingly joyn in Prayers with you. And
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:54614:251"/>
farther, I will add, that I do not think, but some set Form of Prayers, by some Men in some Cases, may be lawfully used.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For this First; I was not willing to have any thing thought of this Lord which is not true; and if it <hi>be altogether false,</hi> (as his Lordship says it is) <hi>that he will not joyn in Prayers with the rest of the Lords in Parliament, but refuses such a Communion;</hi> I would fain know why his Lordship doth not joyn in Prayer with them. For most undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly he may if he will. And since it is most true, that he hath not come to Prayers in the <hi>House</hi> with the rest of the Lords, not so much as once, either in <hi>the last Parliament, or this;</hi> I think it may reasonably be concluded without any Falshood, that his Lordship <hi>will not joyn,</hi> no, not in <hi>such a Communion</hi> with them. Where it is to be observed, he says, he <hi>refuses not such a Communion with them.</hi> He refuses not; yet he will not joyn: And <hi>he refuses not such a Communion.</hi> A Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion I have cause to doubt he doth refuse; but not such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion as goes no farther than Prayers; yet to these he comes not. At the Sacrament, I believe he will be more scrupulous, of whom, or with whom, he receives that.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, his Lordship adds, that <hi>he would most willingly joyn in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with their Lordships.</hi> And though this be most strange, that he should never do that, which he would most willingly do, an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity being offered him every Day: Yet, my Lord is pleased to add farther, what his Judgment is <hi>of set Forms of Prayer.</hi> And he tells you, that he thinks <hi>some set Forms, by some Men, in some Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be lawfully used.</hi> Surely, the Church of <hi>England</hi> is much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to this Lord; very much, and the State too. For the set <hi>Forms of Prayer</hi> which she enjoyns, were compiled by some of those who suffered no less than <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> for the <hi>Reformation of Religion:</hi> The same <hi>Form of Prayer</hi> was established by <hi>Act of Parliament;</hi> and yet, as if <hi>Church and State</hi> were all at a loss, this Noble Lord, who confesses <hi>some set Forms Lawful,</hi> condemns <hi>this Form,</hi> by his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at least, in continual and professed abstaining from it. <hi>Some Forms,</hi> but not this; by <hi>some Men,</hi> but not these; in <hi>some cases,</hi> but not in God's Publick Service in the Church, <hi>may be Lawfully used.</hi> And yet for all these <hi>petty Somes of Restraint,</hi> I know his Lordship's Parts so great, that I dare not say, (as he says of me) that his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is of <hi>narrow Comprehensions.</hi> But his Lordship will now tell us, what that is, in which he is not satisfied.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>But this is that, which I am not satisfied in, that a certain number of Men should usurp an Authority unto themselves, to frame cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Prayers, and Forms of Divine Service; and when that is done, under the Name of the Church to enjoyn them upon all Persons, in all Times, and upon all Occasions, to be used, and no other. And upon this Ground (which makes it the worse) because these come from the publick Spirit of the Church (when the Bishop or his Chaplain shall frame them) and others proceed from the private Spirit of this or that particular Man.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Now, truly, since my Lord does not think <hi>some set Forms of Prayer</hi>
                     <pb n="480" facs="tcp:54614:252"/>
                     <hi>unlawful;</hi> I am very sorry, his Lordship is not satisfied <hi>that a certain Number of Men should frame these Forms of Divine Service.</hi> For all Churchmen cannot possibly meet about that, or any other Church-Affair; nor can any <hi>Synod</hi> or <hi>Assembly</hi> be called, but there must be <hi>some certain Number of them.</hi> Nor do these <hi>Men usurp any Authority to themselves herein:</hi> For in all Ages of the Church, from <hi>Christ</hi> down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, all set Forms of Prayer, used in any Church, have been either made by <hi>a certain Number of Men,</hi> or approved by them, when some Eminent Servant of God hath Composed them first, and then tendred them to the Judgment of the Church. And it is very neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that it should be so. <hi>Nor would the Church of Old admit any Prayers in the publick</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Nec aliae Preces omnino dicantur in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siâ, nisi quae à prudentioribus traditae vel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>Service and Worship of God; but such as were so made, and so approved; lest through Ignorance, or want of Care and Circumspection, something might slip in, that was contrary to the Faith.</hi> But I fear here's <hi>Anguis in Herba.</hi> And that my Lord is not satisfied, not so much because these <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to express it. And if that be his meaning, he must rest unsatisfied still. For <hi>Churchmen,</hi> and <hi>none but Churchmen</hi> must actually do Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church-Work, according to their Calling, and their Warrant. And yet, I hope, <hi>Churchmen</hi> will never be so Proud, but that if any Lay Religious Man, of <hi>larger Comprehensions than themselves,</hi> will offer in private any help to them, they will lend an open Ear to it, and after, with a prudent Consideration, do what is fit.</p>
                  <p>And as this Lord is not satisfied, that <hi>a certain Number of Men</hi> should make these set Forms; so much less is he satisfied, that when this is done, <hi>they should under the Name of the Church, enjoyn them upon all Persons, in all Times, and upon all Occasions, to be used, and no other.</hi> No set Forms, that I know, are enjoyned <hi>under the name of the Church,</hi> but such as the <hi>Church in Synod</hi> hath approved, or tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted till <hi>a Synod</hi> may be called. And when any <hi>National-Church</hi> in a Kingdom that is <hi>Christian,</hi> hath approved a set Form; yet that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be enjoyned upon all Persons, till <hi>the Soveraign Power</hi> in that State, hath weighed, approved, and commanded it. But then, though Framed <hi>by a certain Number of Men,</hi> that, and no other lays hold <hi>on all Persons, and in all Times, and upon all Occasions,</hi> that are Publick; if Men will live in Obedience to the Church and State. I say <hi>Publick,</hi> leaving all <hi>Persons at all Times,</hi> free to use any Form of Prayer <hi>agreeable to the Foundations of Christian Religion,</hi> which shall best serve their several private Occasions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And therefore I conceive, my Lord is in a great Errour in that which he adds next;</hi> Namely, that this Ground makes it the worse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these set Forms are said to come from the Publick Spirit of the Church.</p>
                  <p>I cannot think so hardly of my Lord, as if he could like a set Form of Prayer the worse, because it comes <hi>from the Publick Spirit of the Church.</hi> And therefore I will take his Words in another Sense, (though they be in my Judgment very obscurely set down) and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps that is his Lordship's meaning. That <hi>it makes the matter the</hi>
                     <pb n="481" facs="tcp:54614:252"/>
                     <hi>worse, because these Forms of Prayer come as from the Publick Spirit of the Church, when it is but the Bishop or his Chaplain, or some private Spirit that frames them.</hi> If this be my Lord's meaning; far be it from me, or any other to impose any Form of set Prayers upon the Church. But it is one thing to <hi>Impose,</hi> and quite another to <hi>Compose</hi> a set Form of Prayer. <hi>Impose,</hi> none can but Just Authority. <hi>Compose,</hi> all together cannot; but some one or more must be singled out to take that pains. And <hi>all</hi> or <hi>most</hi> may approve, what <hi>one</hi> or <hi>few</hi> have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled. When it is so approved, then it can no more be said to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from <hi>any private Spirit of this or that Man, be it the Bishop or his Chaplain;</hi> but from the Spirit and Power of the Church. My Lord himself being a Prudent Man, hath had the Happiness to make Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>Parliament,</hi> which have taken <hi>the House,</hi> been approved, and Orders drawn up upon them: When the Order is so agreed on, no Man may say, it is an Order of <hi>my Lord's private Spirit,</hi> but the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>the House,</hi> and approved by the <hi>publick Spirit,</hi> and imposed by the <hi>Publick Authority of the State.</hi> And therefore to me it seems strange, that my Lord, who understands these things so well, should neither like of a set Form of Prayers, Composed by private Men, nor by <hi>a certain number of Men,</hi> and after publickly Confirmed. Sure, this would make any Man think my Lord likes none, however he minces it. But my Lord goes farther, and says,
<q>
                        <p>This Injunction is an Vsurpation of Power over the Churches of <hi>Christ,</hi> and over the Gifts and Graces which <hi>Christ</hi> hath given unto Men; which the Apostles never exercised, nor would assume. And yet they might much better have done it. And the same Reasons might have been alledged for it that are now. This turns such Forms, instead of being Directions, into Superstition.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It seems by this (for I am most willing to take my Lord's Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the fairest) that my Lord can digest <hi>some set Forms of Prayer;</hi> but he would have no <hi>Injunction</hi> upon them. So he that would use them might, and he that would not might choose; and this in short time would bring meer confusion into the Church of God, which I hope is not my Lord's Intention to do. Besides, my Lord cannot but know that <hi>this Injunction for our set Form of Service,</hi> comes not from the Churches Direction and Constitution (though her Wisdom and Piety framed it) but from the Authority and Power of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament.</hi> So that all the Arguments which his Lordship brings here against the <hi>Church,</hi> are equally, if not more, set against the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Parliament.</hi> Well; Why then is not an Injunction of set Form of Prayers fit? Why, my Lord tells you: First, because <hi>it is an Vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Power over the Churches of Christ.</hi> 'Tis indeed, an Act of Power, but no Usurpation. The Church <hi>Directing</hi> and the Soveraign <hi>Enacting,</hi> ever had this Power since States became Christian. And should I have called it an <hi>Vsurpation of Power,</hi> his Lordship, I fear, would have called it <hi>Treason</hi> against the <hi>King's Supremacy.</hi> But I doubt my Lord would have the Churches free from <hi>Regal Power</hi> having ought to do with them, durst he speak out.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because it's <hi>an Vsurpation of Power over the Gifts and Graces which God hath given unto Men.</hi> Not so neither. For whatsoever
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:54614:253"/>
Gifts or Graces God hath given unto Men, they may all have time, place, and occasions enough, to use them to God's Glory, and the Comfort of themselves and others; and yet in the Publick Service of God, submit to that set <hi>Form of God's Worship,</hi> which is enjoyned for Unity and Decency in that External Service. So this lays no restraint upon the <hi>Gifts and Graces</hi> of pious and religious Men: But it keeps off bold, ignorant, and audacious Men, from <hi>foming out their own shame,</hi> to the great disorder and scandal of the Church of <hi>Christ.</hi> As we may see at this day, now that Injunction begins to be but a little loosed, what Froth and base Stuff is preached to the Consciences of Men. And yet these Men, which preach thus scandalously, talk of Gifts and Graces; none more.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, because <hi>the Apostles never Exercised, nor would Assume this Power of enjoyning a set Form, and yet they might better have done it.</hi> But how doth my Lord know, the <hi>Apostles</hi> never <hi>Exercised,</hi> nor would <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume</hi> this Power? Out of all doubt the Apostles did <hi>Exercise</hi> and <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume</hi> many things, which are not come down to our knowledge. And since the Apostles did enjoyn a Form of Doctrine to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and delivered it too. And since St. <hi>Paul</hi> enjoyned the Church <note place="margin">

And this with a stiff In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>v.</hi> 21. And <hi>a Form of wholesome words,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. And since, St. <hi>John the Baptist</hi> taught his Disciples to pray, St. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. and that it <note place="margin">
                        <hi>St. Luke</hi> 11. 1.</note> was by some set Form of Prayer, I have some Reason to think: First, because if they did Pray by the Motion of the Spirit only, St. <hi>John</hi> could not teach them that, but <hi>the Spirit</hi> only. So either St. <hi>John</hi> taught them not at all to pray, which I hope this Lord will not say against a plain Text. Or else he taught them some set Form, which was in his power and theirs, to teach and learn. Secondly, because <hi>Christ's</hi> Disciples seem to intimate so much. For they desire <hi>Christ</hi> to <hi>teach them to pray, as St.</hi> John <hi>taught his Disciples.</hi> And <hi>Christ</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>v.</hi> 2.</note> instantly granting their Request, taught them <hi>a set Form of Prayer:</hi> Therefore it is more than probable, that St. <hi>John</hi> taught his so too, though the Form be not Recorded in Scripture. Upon all which laid together, it is probable enough (by my Lord's leave) that the <hi>Apostles</hi> did <hi>Exercise</hi> some set Form, that at least which <hi>Christ</hi> taught them. And <hi>Assumed</hi> Power to enjoyn it upon their Followers. But herein yet the <hi>Apostles</hi> are somewhat beholding to this Lord, that he re-allows, <hi>they might better have done it,</hi> than any now-adays. Well; I will not dispute what they might better have done; sure I am, it may and ought to be done now.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, because <hi>the same Reasons might then have been alledged for it, that are now.</hi> The <hi>same</hi> might, but not <hi>all the same.</hi> In particular, the Church was small then, and might with ease be Ordered, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of the great Congregations that are now. But especially the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Apostolical Men</hi> were then present, and could <hi>in another manner,</hi> and with a <hi>greater Power</hi> than Men now adays both Judge and Order the <hi>Gifts and Graces of other Men,</hi> to the avoiding of confusion in the Church, which God by his Apostles would none of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="483" facs="tcp:54614:253"/>
Besides, the <hi>Apostles</hi> and some others in those Times, had the Grace and the Gift of Prayer, as well as other Graces. And there was then as peculiar a Gift by Inspiration to pray, as to foretell things to come, or to do Miracles. As is evident in St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> who says, that <hi>these</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>St.</hi> Chrysost. <hi>in Rom.</hi> 8. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>Men made use of this Gift, and Prayed publickly in their Assemblies.</hi> But so soon as this Gift with others ceased, there was a set Form from the beginning. Neither is it hard to prove, that some parts of our <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy</hi> hath been as Ancient as the Church hath any Records to shew; and some both practised and prescribed by the Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> for the substance of them. And the true Reason why we cannot shew the exact Primitive Forms then in use, is, because they were continually subject to Alterations, both in times and places. Now if this Lord can furnish us with such Men, as shall be inabled to pray by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Inspiration of God's Spirit, we will bind them up to no Form: But 'till he can, I hope we shall be so happy, as to retain the set Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, because <hi>this</hi> (<hi>enjoyning</hi>) <hi>turns such Forms, instead of being Directions, into Superstition.</hi> This is so wild a Conceit, that I wonder how it fell into the Thought of so Wise a Man as my Lord is taken to be. For can a <hi>Command</hi> or an <hi>Injunction</hi> alter the very Nature of a Thing so far, as to turn that which is a <hi>Direction,</hi> into a Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Then belike it is <hi>Superstition,</hi> for any <hi>Christian</hi> to obey the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and Injunctions,</hi> whether for Belief or <hi>Practice,</hi> made by any <hi>the four first General Councils.</hi> And my Lord knows well that 'tis <hi>Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> for any Man to profess against any of <hi>these Councils.</hi> And this not only by the <hi>Church Law</hi> (which his Lordship so much slights) but by <hi>the Laws of England.</hi> So by this Reason of my Lord's, it <note place="margin">1 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1.</note> shall be <hi>Heretical</hi> to deny the <hi>Injunction,</hi> and Superstition to obey it.</p>
                  <p>If this will not serve; my Lord may be pleased to remember, that in the <hi>Council</hi> held at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by the Apostles themselves; they <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 24, 29.</note> gave a <hi>Command</hi> though no such <hi>Command,</hi> as might trouble the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And therefore Decreed, that they would lay no greater burthen on them. No more grievous <hi>Injunction,</hi> than <hi>that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>v.</hi> 28.</note> 
                     <hi>they abstain from things offered unto Idols, and from Blood, and from things strangled, and from Fornication;</hi> where first, it is most evident, that the Apostles <hi>did assume this power of enjoyning, and exercise it too.</hi> And I hope, my Lord, for very Reverence to the Scripture, (for as for the Church he valueth it not) will not say this wholesom <hi>Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to avoid Fornication, <hi>is made Superstition by the Apostle's Injunction.</hi> If this Doctrine may hold, I doubt very few will be Superstitious in this point. And many Men, that are very strict and hate Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition perfectly, will rather not abstain from <hi>Fornication,</hi> than be Superstitious by abstaining. And no question can be made by a Reasonable Man, but that the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> had and hath still as much Power to enjoyn a set Form of Prayers, as any of these things. But my Lord hath more Reasons than these; and truly they had need be better too. But such as they are, they follow:
<q>
                        <p>This sets aside the Gifts and Graces which <hi>Christ</hi> hath given; and thrusts out the Exercise of them, to substitute in their places, and introduce a Device of Man.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="484" facs="tcp:54614:254"/>
Sixthly, then this Injunction of a set Form is unlawful; <hi>because it sets aside the Gifts and Graces,</hi> &amp;c. This is upon the Matter all one with my Lord's second Reason; and there 'tis answered. Yet truly I know no <hi>Gifts or Graces set aside, much less thruss out,</hi> but such as are <hi>neither Gifts nor Graces</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> but the Bold and Impudent At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of <hi>Weavers, Coblers,</hi> and <hi>Felt-Makers,</hi> taking on them to Preach without Knowledge, Warrant, or Calling. Much like the Gifts, which <hi>Alexander</hi> the Copper-Smith had in St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Time. And <hi>such Gifts and Graces</hi> as these, cannot be said to be thrust out. But my Lord and his Adherents thrust them into the Church, to help cry down <hi>all Truth</hi> and <hi>Order.</hi> Much less can they be said, to be thrust out <hi>to make room for a Device of Man,</hi> meaning the set Form of Common-Prayer. Now surely, I think, and upon very good grounds, that they which Composed the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book,</hi> had as good Gifts and Graces of <hi>Christ</hi> as these Men have. And that the conceived, and often-times, <hi>Senseless Prayers</hi> of these Men, are as much or more the <hi>Device of Man,</hi> than the <hi>set Form of Common-Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is.</hi> Yea, but for all that, my Lord says:
<q>
                        <p>This Injunction of such Forms upon all Men, turns that which in the beginning Necessity brought in, for the help of Insufficiency, to be now the continuance and maintenance of Insufficiency, and a bar to the Exercise of able and sufficient Gifts and Graces. As if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some Men had need to make use of Crutches, all Men should be prohibited the use of their Legs, and enjoyned to take up such Crutches, as have been prepared for those who had no Legs.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Seventh and last place, my Lord is pleased to tell us, <hi>this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of such Forms upon all Men, turns that, which in the beginning Necessity brought in for the help of Insufficiency, to the Maintenance of it.</hi> My Lord told us a little before, of a <hi>turning into Superstition:</hi> Now here's another <hi>turning into the Maintenance of Insufficiency;</hi> two very bad <hi>turnings,</hi> were either of them true: But God be thanked neither is. In the mean time my Lord confesses, that <hi>Necessity</hi> brought in this <hi>Injunction of set Forms.</hi> And I believe, there now is and ever will be, to the end of the World, as great <hi>a Necessity to continue them.</hi> But I cannot agree with my Lord in this, that it was <hi>a Necessity for the help of Insufficiency</hi> that brought them in. For when these were first enjoyned in the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> Men were endued with as great <hi>Gifts and Graces,</hi> as any now are; and perhaps greater. But <hi>Necessity</hi> brought them in when <hi>Christianity</hi> multiplyed, to preserve Unity and Order, and to avoid Confusion, and <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Schisms</hi> in the Church: And that all sorts of Men might be acquainted with that, which was used in the Publick Worship and Service of God.</p>
                  <p>Now that which follows, is an unjust and foul Scandal upon the Church. Namely, <hi>that this Injunction is made the Continuance and Maintenance of Insufficiency.</hi> For I believe <hi>few Churches in many Ages,</hi> have had more sufficient Preachers than this of late hath had. And therefore 'tis evident, <hi>this Injunction</hi> here, hath neither been the <hi>maintenance</hi> nor <hi>continuance of Insufficiency.</hi> This ground failing, my
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:54614:254"/>
Lord's fine <hi>Simile</hi> hath neither <hi>Crutch</hi> nor <hi>Leg</hi> to stand on; but it is as all such fine fetches are, when they have no Ground to rest on: Nor is any thing more Poor in Learning, than a fine, handsom Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, such as this, when it hath <hi>no truth</hi> upon which to rest. For the best that can be said of it, is, that it is a pretty fine thing, if it were to the purpose.</p>
                  <p>But to come nearer to the Business; I would have his Lordship remember, that <hi>Christ</hi> taught his Apostles a set Form of Prayer St. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>St. Luc.</hi> 11. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 11. And I believe, they were so religiously Dutiful, as that they would not beg of <hi>Christ</hi> to teach them to Pray, and when he had taught them, then neglect, or not practise the very Form he taught. If my Lord can think this of the Apostles, he may; I cannot. Nor can I think, that <hi>Christ</hi> taught them this Form, <hi>to be used as Crutches</hi> till their <hi>Legs</hi> were grown stronger. For our Saviour, doth not say, till ye be stronger, and have better Gifts, Pray as I teach you; but simply and absolutely, <hi>when you Pray, say, Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. That is, say these very Words, this very Form. And what? Will my Lord say that <hi>Christ</hi> taught them this Form <hi>to maintain them in Insufficiency?</hi> Or did he make <hi>Crutches</hi> for their Lameness? Or thereby prohibit the use of their <hi>Legs?</hi> This Speech savours of more Profaneness, than well become such a Professor.</p>
                  <p>His Lordship speaks better of them in another place. There he <note place="margin">In his Speech against the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops Votes in Parliament, p. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> can say, <hi>there never were, nor ever will be Men of so great Abilities and Gifts as they were Endued withal.</hi> And I think he dares not say, I am sure, nor he, nor any Man living can prove, that the <hi>Apostles,</hi> when their Gifts were at fullest, did neglect, or not use this Form of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which <hi>Christ</hi> taught them. Therefore, either to use a set Form of Prayer is not to use <hi>Crutches;</hi> or if it be, 'tis to use the same, or the like <hi>Crutches,</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> made, and his <hi>Apostles</hi> used. And they will better beseem any good <hi>Christians</hi> to use, than his own <hi>Legs,</hi> be they never so good. And for the set Prayers of the Church, this I think I am sure of; That the Men which are cry'd up by my Lord to have such excellent <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces,</hi> are in as much need of these <hi>Crutches</hi> as other Men. In the mean time, my Lord every way shews his Love to the set Liturgy of the Church, that makes nothing of it but <hi>Crutches;</hi> which a Man, if the <hi>Bath</hi> cure him, would gladly hang up, and leave behind him. I well hoped to have found, that my Lord had entertained more moderate thoughts of things appertaining unto Religion. But since he himself thus proclaims it otherwise; let us see how he goes forward without these Crutches.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>This I confess I am not satisfied in; yet will farther say thus much. Here are with your Lordships some Bishops, Men of great Parts, able to Offer up this Worship unto God, in the use of those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> which God hath endued them with. And certainly they ought to serve him with the best of their Abilities which they have received. Let them make use of their own Gifts; nay, let them but profess, that they account not themselves bound to use Forms, nor to this Form they use, more than any other; but that it is free for them to conceive Prayer, or to help themselves by the use of any other Form, they please, as well as this prescribed. And let them practise the
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:54614:255"/>
same indifferently, that so it may be manifest, the Fault rests in the person, and not in the Service: In the negligence of him that may offer better if he will, not in the Injunction of that which is offered. And I will not refuse to come to Prayers. For I take the Sin then to be personal, and to reside in the Person Officiating only.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Now my Lord goes on farther, and tells us, <hi>That there are with your Lordships, some Bishops; Men of great Parts, able to offer this Worship unto God,</hi> &amp;c. Indeed my Lord goes far here; and I am glad to hear that any <hi>Bishops</hi> can please him. Are Bishops, even as such, Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>Antichrist</hi> (so I am sure my Lord, and his Followers have accounted them, and their Libels Print them for such every Day) and now can any <hi>Offer this Worship unto God,</hi> which his Lordship would have? Why then, my Lord can be pleased, I see, that even in <hi>this Church,</hi> God should be Worshiped by <hi>the Members of Antichrist.</hi> Or if not, then in this Passage he grosly Dissembles.</p>
                  <p>But what is <hi>this Worship</hi> which his Lordship would have? Why, it is to Pray in Publick, and not by a set Form enjoyned; <hi>but in the use of those Gifts which God hath Endued them with.</hi> And it is most undoubtedly true which follows, <hi>that they ought to serve God with the best of the abilities they have received.</hi> But 'tis as true, that <hi>Bishops,</hi> and all <hi>Ministers</hi> else, ought to serve God with <hi>the best Abilities which the Church of</hi> Christ <hi>can furnish them with.</hi> And I presume, I shall not wrong any my <hi>Brethren,</hi> not those of the greatest Parts, If I say, (as I must) that <hi>those Bishops,</hi> and other <hi>Divines,</hi> which Composed the set Form of our Service, and <hi>enjoyned</hi> it too (as far as their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reached) were Men of as great Piety and Learning, and all other good Parts, as any now living. And it can be no Disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; much less any fault or dulling of their own Gifts, for <hi>the best of Bishops</hi> to use the set Forms ordered by them. And the Phrase, which my Lord uses, is somewhat unusual. <hi>To offer this Worship un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</hi> We are said indeed to offer up our Prayers unto God, and by so doing to Worship, Honour, and Serve him; and him alone in that. But to offer Worship to God, I think is an improper Phrase at least. And <hi>Psal.</hi> 110. the People are said <hi>to offer their Free-Will-Offerings</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 110. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>with an Holy Worship, or in the Beauties of Holiness.</hi> And though perhaps his Lordship will not allow of this Translation; yet so far he may, as to see the use of the Phrase. And in <hi>the Beauties</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">In decoribus Sanctitatis, Ar. Mant. Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>of Holiness</hi> (which keeps close to the <hi>Original</hi>) will please him less: Since a <hi>Barn</hi> with them, is as good as a <hi>Church.</hi> And no Church <hi>Holy</hi> with them; but that which is <hi>Slovenly,</hi> even to <hi>Nastiness.</hi> But then, 'tis void of all Superstition.</p>
                  <p>Next, my Lord proposes some Conditions, which being observed, his Lordship will not refuse to come to Common-Prayer.</p>
                  <p>I'll examine these then. For I would have all just Demands of his granted, that he may come.</p>
                  <p>The First is, <hi>Let these Bishops</hi> (and others I suppose he means) <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                     <hi>make use of their own Gifts.</hi> Well; let them on God's Name, in that Dutiful, Peaceable, and Orderly Way, make use of their own Gifts, not crossing what <hi>the Church justly prescribes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="487" facs="tcp:54614:255"/>
Secondly, <hi>Let them but profess, that they account not themselves bound</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>to use Forms.</hi> This Condition is somewhat hard. For if they shall acknowledge they hold themselves bound to <hi>no Forms,</hi> they must be bound to <hi>no Order:</hi> And how <hi>Bishops</hi> will keep the Church in Order, if they will be bound to observe none themselves, I cannot tell. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, if they shall profess this, they must profess against the constant and continued Practice of the whole Church of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Let them profess they are not bound to this Form they use more</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>than any other, but that it is free for them to conceive Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. Harder and harder. For they stand bound not only by <hi>Church-Ordinance,</hi> but by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, and Command of the State in Parliament,</hi> strictly to observe this Form. And they are therefore bound to this Form more than any other. And therefore so long as this <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> remains in force, with what Honour or Conscience can this Lord (who seems to stand so much upon <hi>Law</hi>) ask this at the Bishops Hands, that they should profess, that they are not bound to any Forms? Nor, to this more than any other; when his Lordship must needs know, they are bound to this, and no other, and that by an Act of Parliament. Besides, What a Coil hath been kept by some of this Lord's Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, against <hi>Innovations of Religion,</hi> as contrary to Law? No <hi>Rails</hi> to fence the Holy Table from Prophanation? Though that be no Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, nor forbidden by Law. <hi>No coming up to it,</hi> or <hi>the steps of the Chancel,</hi> to receive the Communion, though most decent, and in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient usage, and forbidden by no Law that I know? <hi>No Reverence to God himself</hi> at coming in, or going out of his <hi>Temple;</hi> though that of the <hi>Psalmist</hi> began the <hi>ancient Liturgies</hi> of the Church, and is continued in our <hi>O come let us worship and fall down, and kneel before the Lord our maker,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 95. 6.</note> &amp;c. <hi>Psal.</hi> 95. The <hi>Communion-Table</hi> must not stand North and South; though the <hi>Queens Injunction</hi> commanded it to be set just in that Place, in which <hi>the Altar</hi> then stood. So they <hi>innovate</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and then cry out of <hi>Innovation.</hi> And if this Lord's Doctrin be good; let's have no <hi>Injunction</hi> for North and South, and all's well: But then we must have no <hi>Injunction</hi> for East and West neither. For if there be an <hi>Injunction;</hi> East and West is Superstition, as well as North and South.</p>
                  <p>But then if my Lord would have all free; what would he have in this Particular? Why, First, he would have it <hi>free for these Men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Prayer.</hi> Let them in due time and place <hi>conceive Prayer</hi> on God's Name: But let them not make <hi>publick Abortion</hi> in the Church. 'Tis an over-hasty Mother, that brings forth so soon as she has Concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: And yet, Extemporary Men out-run these Mothers; and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and bring forth</hi> their unnatural Monsters, both at once.</p>
                  <p>Next, he would have <hi>these Men to help themselves by the use of any other Forms, they please, as well as this which is prescribed.</hi> So then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, these great <hi>Men of Gifts</hi> in my Lord's Eye, are not so perfect in the Spirit, but that they may need helps. And if my Lord be so indifferent, that these may help <hi>themselves by the use of any other Forms, as well as this which is prescribed;</hi> let him be as fair, at least, to the Church that made him a <hi>Christian,</hi> as to others; and give Men leave to help themselves, by the use of this Form which is prescribed, as well any other. And if it be the <hi>Injunction</hi> only that sticks in his
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:54614:256"/>
Stomach, I am sorry he should shew himself so Guilty of <hi>the great Sin of Disobedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Let them practise the same indifferently, that so it may be</hi>

                     <hi>manifest the Fault rests in the Person, and not in the Service,</hi> &amp;c. This is his Lordship's last Condition. And either I am dulled with this Business; or the Expression is somewhat obscure: But I will take it as right as I can. It seems, my Lord would not refuse coming to the Prayers of the Church, for <hi>the Personal Fault of him that Officiates:</hi> And that's well. It seems likewise, that to manifest this, <hi>whether the Sin lies in the Person that offers; or in the Service that is Offered up, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship would have an indifferent practice of that which is enjoyned and other Forms.</hi> And that's stark naught. For by this, we shall have no certain Service of God for the People. It shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and perhaps, more dangerously than is fit; not only in different Parishes; but in the same Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at different times. And were not this so, yet I cannot assent to my Lord in this, that these Men he means, can so easily offer better if they will; and that when they do not, it is their Negligence that is the only Cause. And besides, it is useless: For it is known already to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Minds, that the Fault (when any arises in that Work) is neither in the <hi>Service,</hi> which is very good; nor in the <hi>Injunction,</hi> which is very Lawful; but in the <hi>Person</hi> which Officiates, if he do not his Duty: And so there is no need of a confused practising of divers Forms indifferently, to manifest that, which is known already. And if my Lord brings no worse Sins about him, when he comes to Church, than he will find Faults in <hi>the Liturgy;</hi> he may safely come to Church, and be a Happy Man, in so doing. And I might well doubt of my Lord's meaning herein; for himself is jealous of his Auditors. Therefore he adds;
<q>
                        <p>I know not, whether I express my self clearly, to be understood in this or not; and it may seem to be a nice Scrupulosity: Give me leave therefore to endeavour to clear it by an Instance or two.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Truly my Lord takes himself right. For neither hath he expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed himself very clearly; nor is the matter so material in it self, but that it may be, as it seems, <hi>a very nice Scrupulosity,</hi> and altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to warrant his Lordship's <hi>Separation</hi> from the Prayers of the Church. Yet since my Lord desires <hi>to clear it by an Instance or two;</hi> I shall be well content to hear and consider of them. His First In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is,
<q>
                        <p>In the time of the Law, when God appointed himself to be Worshipped by Offerings and Sacrifices; the Shadows and Types of those Truths which were to come: If a Poor Man, which had not Ability to bring a Bullock, or a Ram, or a Lamb, had brought a pair of Turtle Doves, or two Young Pigeons; it would have been in him an acceptable Service. But if a Man of Ability, who had Herds and Flocks; should out of Negligence or Covetousness, have spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Cost of a Bullock or Ram, and brought Young Pigeons; his Service would have been rejected, and himself punished. How much more would the Service have been Abomination, if Men
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:54614:256"/>
should have taken Authority to have enjoyned all, to bring no other but Turtles, or Young Pigeons; because some were not able to do more? In one kind there might be a tolerable and lawful [use] of that which otherways used, (especially if generally enjoyned) would have been most unlawful. God will be Worshipped with the Fat, and best of the Inwards; the best of Mens Gifts and Abilities, which he that worships, or officiates in Worshipping, is to do at his own Peril. And if it be left free unto him, the Worship may be Lawful to him, that joyneth with him therein, in it self, though performed in a negligent, and so in a sinful manner, by the Minister. But if that manner be enjoyned, the Service it self is to be refused.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is my Lord's First Instance from the Services under the Law. And I must needs say, he hath made it clear what he would have. But then, he must give me leave to say too, that <hi>this Instance</hi> differs so mainly from the thing in question; that it helps my Lord and his Cause in nothing. Perhaps it makes it worse than it was.</p>
                  <p>The difference is: God in the Law, did not only prescribe all the Sacrifices and Offerings which he would have, and for what: But also when, and how he would have them. And the Poor man which had not Ability to bring the greater Sacrifice, might by the express Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Law, bring Turtles or Pigeons. Levit. 5. <hi>But if a Rich</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Man had brought them, his Service would have been rejected, and himself punished.</hi> So says my Lord: But <hi>the Law says not so.</hi> He that brought it, should have born his Sin, and the Priest could have made no Attonement for him; which was punishment enough. But that he should any other way be punished, I find not <hi>in the Text of the Law.</hi> And this Lord, which will admit of nothing but <hi>Text,</hi> should not presume to add any thing to it. <note n="*" place="margin">Apud Ains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth in Levit. <hi>20. 3.</hi>
                     </note> The <hi>Rabbins</hi> indeed, reckon up Six and Thirty kinds of Offenders, which for their Sins are threatned to be cut off from their People; and some are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Levit.</hi> 7. &amp; 17.

Well, this was the strict prescription of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and Offerings in <hi>the Law.</hi> But in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> though <hi>Christ</hi> set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his <hi>Doctrin</hi> and <hi>Sacraments;</hi> yet <hi>when,</hi> and <hi>how,</hi> with other Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Things, were left at large to the <hi>Ordering</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and the Church after them; always providing for <hi>

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> and Order.</hi> And this Liberty was left as much, if not more, in <hi>Preaching and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayer,</hi> than in the <hi>Sacraments.</hi> And therefore my Lord's Instance in this way, will not follow from the <hi>Law</hi> to the <hi>Gospel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To give instance in his own Words. In the <hi>Law; The poor Man which had nor Bullock, nor Lamb, might by the express Warrant of the Law bring Turtles or Pigeons;</hi> but they were to be his own which he bought; and the <hi>Priest</hi> was to make his Attonement accordingly. But in the <hi>Gospel</hi> Men do not bring to the <hi>Priest or Minister</hi> their own Doctrins, or their <hi>Prayers;</hi> but he offers in publick <hi>the Sermon</hi> to them, and <hi>the Prayers</hi> for them. So here the Instance comes not home neither.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As for my Lord's Aggravation;</hi> How much more would the Service have been abomination, if Men should have taken Authority to themselves,
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:54614:257"/>
                     <hi>and have enjoyned all to bring nothing but Turtles or Pigeons?</hi> Indeed it would have been full of <hi>Abomination;</hi> because in <hi>this Injunction</hi> they would have gone quite contrary to God's own Command. And let my Lord shew in the Gospel any Precept, that commands Men to use <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary,</hi> or <hi>Conceived Prayers,</hi> in the Publick Service or Worship of God; or that forbids the use of a <hi>Set Form of Prayer;</hi> and then I will grant the <hi>Church's Injunction</hi> of such Forms to be in the highest degree unlawful. But these cannot be shewed.</p>
                  <p>Besides, there is a great deal of <hi>Pride</hi> in this <hi>Instance.</hi> For my Lord all along the <hi>Instance,</hi> makes the Set Forms of the Church, <hi>Turtles and Pigeons, the poor Man's Sacrifice;</hi> and the <hi>Conceived Prayers of his Party,</hi> to be the <hi>Rich and able Men's Sacrifice,</hi> the <hi>Ram</hi> and the <hi>Bullock</hi> (the <hi>Calf</hi> I doubt it is.) So a very little before, his Lordship tells us, of a Negligence <hi>in those his Men of Gifts, which might offer better if they will.</hi> As if it were a most easie thing for those Men to offer up far better Prayers to God, than the Set <hi>Liturgy</hi> of the Church. Whereas my Lord must give me leave to doubt that, even of the best of them. And so again a little after, his Lordship tells us, <hi>That God will be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped with the Fat and the best of the Inwards,</hi> which he Interprets <hi>with the best of Mens Gifts and Abilities;</hi> and of this there is no doubt. Nor doth the enjoning of <hi>a Set Form of Publick Prayer</hi> hinder any Man from worshipping God with the best Gifts and Abilities which he hath. And who should be served with the best, if not he that gave them all? But here's the Pride of the Instance again: Their conceived, tedious, and oft-times senseless Prayers, must be the <hi>Fat and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> with which God is pleased; and the Set Forms of the Church <hi>Lean Carrion, and not fit for the Altar.</hi> O, my Lord, that you would in time lay your Hand on your Heart, and consider from what, and into what you are fallen!</p>
                  <p>My Lord concludes this Instance with this, <hi>That if it be left free to him that Officiates, 'tis his personal Sin if he be negligent; but it may be lawful for another that joins with him in that Service: But if that manner be enjoined, the Service it self is to be refused.</hi> And after this great Pride in, or of this Opinion, my Lord ends with <note n="*" place="margin">'Tis <hi>Fallacia Accidentis:</hi> For it is not in, or of the nature of Prayer, that it should be in a negligent Form set down, or negligently performed; but a meer acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and a bad one.</note> a Fallacy. For the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not, Whether <hi>a negligent Set Form of Prayer,</hi> or a <hi>Good Form of Set Prayer, negligently and without Devotion offer'd up to God</hi> (as too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten they are, God help us) be better than other Prayers, <hi>carefully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed</hi> and <hi>devoutly uttered?</hi> But simply, Whether a good Set Form of Prayer (such as the <hi>Liturgy of England</hi> is) be made so evil, only by the <hi>enjoyning</hi> of it, <hi>as that therefore the Service it self ought to be refused?</hi> Now this my Lord may say as boldly as he will; but neither he nor any man else shall ever be able to prove it.</p>
                  <p>And in this very close, I cannot but observe, that which in me or another Man would have been great Pride: But what it is in this Lord, let the Reader judge. For he doth not conclude, that <hi>this Form being enjoyned,</hi> is the Cause why he refuses to come to our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. But absolutely, as if all Men were bound to do as <hi>he</hi> doth. He says peremptorily, that in this Case of Injunction of a set Form, <hi>the Service it self ought to be refused.</hi> So that by this Doctrine, he is a Sinner that refuses not the Prayers of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> My Lord in the beginning, askt <hi>leave to speak a few Words, concerning</hi>
                     <pb n="491" facs="tcp:54614:257"/>
                     <hi>himself;</hi> but I believe, these will be found to concern some body else. Well, 'tis time to consider of my Lord's second Instance; and so I will.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Now in the time of the Gospel, God hath appointed the foolishness of Preaching, (for so the World accounts it) to be the Means by which he will save those that Believe. I conceive, where there are not Gifts enabling Men to Preach, there might be a lawful and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table use of Reading of Printed Sermons and Homilies; and in such Cases they might very lawfully be heard. But if some Men, upon pretence to prevent Extravagant Preaching, should take upon them to set forth a Book of Publick Common Sermons, fit for all Times and Occasions; and should enjoyn Ministers to conform to these, and use no other Preaching at all, but the Reading of those Common Sermons or Homilies so devised, for Publick Worship; this would make it utterly Vnlawful, and to be Professed against, as that which were the bringing in of a Humane Device and Injunction in the place, and instead of God's Ordinance, to the Exclusion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. As the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> to establish Traditions of their own, made void the Commandments of God.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>I hope, my Lord will have no better success with this Instance under the <hi>Gospel,</hi> than he had with that under the <hi>Law.</hi> And yet whatsoever is Truth in his Instance, I shall most willingly grant. And therefore I do acknowledge, that <hi>in the time of the Gospel, God appointed the foolishness of Preaching,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. to be <hi>a Means;</hi> but <hi>not</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>to be The Means</hi> (if it be meant the only Means) <hi>by which he will save those that believe.</hi> I likewise confess, that in <hi>the World's Account 'tis made the Foolishness of Preaching.</hi> And I would to God some Men, much magnified in these Times, did not give too often very just Cause to the World to account it, not only the <hi>Foolishness,</hi> but the Madness of Preaching; such <hi>Preaching</hi> as is far from being <hi>a Means of Salvation.</hi> I conceive also, as well as my Lord, <hi>that where there are no Gifts enabling Men to Preach,</hi> (as it falls out in too many <hi>Parishes in England,</hi> and the true Cause is, the smallness of the Living, unable to Feed and Cloath Men, and therefore cannot expect Men of Parts) <hi>there</hi> not only <hi>might be,</hi> but is <hi>a lawful and profitable use of Reading of Printed Sermons and Homilies; and that in such Cases,</hi> yes, and in <hi>other</hi> Cases too, <hi>they may very lawfully be heard.</hi> And I think farther, that if <hi>some Men,</hi> not upon their own <hi>private Authority,</hi> but lawfully meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a <hi>Synod or Convocation,</hi> shall, <hi>not upon pretence,</hi> but truly <hi>to prevent Extravagant Preaching,</hi> such as of late hath been, and is too common in <hi>England, should take upon them to set forth a Book of common Sermons, such as might be fit for all Times and all Occasions,</hi> which is not impossible to be done, <hi>and should enjoyn Ministers to conform to these, and use no other Preaching at all, but the Reading of these common Sermons or Homilies so devised for publick Worship;</hi> I must needs say, it were a <hi>Cure</hi> not to be used but in <hi>Extremity,</hi> to bar all other Preaching for the Abuse of some, be it never so gross. Yet if the Distempers of the Pulpit, should grow in any National Church so high, so Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, so Heretical and Blasphemous, so Schismatical and Outragious,
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:54614:258"/>
as many of them have been of late in this distracted Church of ours; I say, if such <hi>a Book of Sermons,</hi> should be so set out, by the Church direction, and published by the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>King and Parliament,</hi> as the <hi>Book of Common Prayer</hi> is: When the Comparison is made thus even, and my Lords Instance so brought home: <note n="*" place="margin">In the Church of <hi>Africa,</hi> when the <hi>Arian</hi> Heresie began, the Church had suffered so much by the Preaching of <hi>Arius</hi> the Presbyter, that they made a Law not to suffer any Presbyter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> Preach at all, at least not in the Mother Church, and in the Bishop's Presence. As may be seen in <hi>Socrates, l. 5. Hist. c. 22.</hi> And though this may seem a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Cure, yet when the Disease grew Masterful and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the Church did not refuse to use it.</note> I do then think, such a Book, <hi>not devised for publick Worship,</hi> but for <hi>publick Instruction</hi> (for Sermons are not properly the Worship of God, but as to teach us Faith and Obedience, and how we are to pray and give Worship to him) might be used with great profit; yea, and with far more than many Sermons of the present time, which do in a manner teach nothing but <hi>Disobedience to Princes and all Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, under a false pretence of Obedience to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for the <hi>Injunction</hi> which sticks so much with my Lord; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in Cases of such Extremity, as is above-mentioned, and when nothing else will serve, I conceive it might well and profitably be laid upon the Ministers; and yet that such an <hi>Imposition,</hi> would be far <hi>from making it utterly unlawful, and to be professed against, as that which were the bringing in of a Humane Device in the place, and instead of God's Ordinance, to the Exclusion thereof.</hi> For 'tis probable, these Sermons my Lord speaks of, would be Preached before they were Printed. And the end of their being Preached, was <hi>to publish Christ and his Gospel</hi> to the World. And that also, was or ought to be the end of Publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same Sermons in Print, that the benefit of them might reach the farther, and be of longer continuance. So that upon the Matter, <hi>the Printing of Sermons,</hi> is but a large and more open <hi>Preaching</hi> of them still. And then if Preaching be <hi>God's Ordinance;</hi> Printing of Sermons is the <hi>publishing of God's Ordinance.</hi> And therefore, if there were <hi>an Injunction for a Book of Sermons,</hi> as is mentioned; it were but a more publick <hi>and durable divulging of God's Ordinance; and not the bringing in of a Humane Device instead of it, and to the Exclusion thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for that which follows, <hi>that this is like the</hi> Pharisees, <hi>who, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish Traditions of their own, made void the Commandments of God.</hi> This is but a <hi>Simile,</hi> and is Answered in the former. And you see, that should any Necessity force the making of such an Injunction (which God forbid) it did help to publish God's Ordinance, and not make void his Commandments. Howsoever, my Lord may take this along with him: That that Party, which he governs in this Kingdom, are as well seen in this Art of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> as any Men in <hi>Christendom;</hi> and will, if they be let alone, make void <hi>all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God,</hi> to bring in their <hi>Dreams,</hi> against all <hi>Reason, Religion</hi> and <hi>lawful Authority.</hi> And this is most true, whatever they think of themselves. But my Lord desires farther consideration of his Instance.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Let it be considered, what difference can be found between these, but only this. Vse and Custom hath inured us to that of Prayer, not so in this of Preaching; and therefore the Evil of it would easily appear unto us, if so enjoined.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>It is fit, my Lord should have his desire in this; <hi>that it be considered what difference can be found between these:</hi> And out of all doubt my Lord
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:54614:258"/>
acknowledges, that some difference there is. And were it <hi>this only</hi> (as his Lordship would have it.) <hi>That Vse and Custom hath inured us to that of Prayer, and not so in this of Preaching;</hi> that might be Reason enough to continue our publick set Form of Prayer. For if the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice have not fault in it, but that 'tis <hi>enjoyned:</hi> And if the <hi>enjoyning</hi> of a good Service of God Almighty, in which <hi>Christian</hi> People may consent, and unanimously and uniformly worship him, be no fault at all, as most certain it is not: 'Tis neither wisdom nor safety to cast off such a <hi>Custom or Vsage,</hi> and leave every Minister (and perhaps other Men too) to make what Prayers they please in the <hi>Congregation,</hi> which doubtless would be many times such, as no good understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Christian</hi> could say <hi>Amen</hi> to.</p>
                  <p>Besides, with my Lord's leave, upon the <hi>Consideration</hi> which he desires me to take, I think I have found <hi>other Differences.</hi> For, besides <hi>the Vse and Custom which we are inured to,</hi> I find, that to have some set Form of Prayer, when the Congregation meets, is little less than * <hi>Traditio Vniversalis,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">'Tis Vniversal for Time. For it is testified by <hi>Dionysius the Areopagite</hi> (if those Works be his) <hi>De Ecclesia Hierar: P: 77: Edit: Gr: Lat.</hi> and he was one of the Contemporaries of the Apostles, that there were then set Forms of Prayer, to which all the People said <hi>Amen.</hi> And if <hi>Dionysius</hi> were not the Author, yet the Work is exceeding Ancient.

                     </note> an Universal Tradition of the whole Church. And that it took beginning, while some of the <hi>Apostles</hi> were yet living, and hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued from thence in all <hi>Ages</hi> and <hi>Places</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> to this day. Now, though parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Customs and Traditions vary and may be varied in several Churches; yet I do not find there is such a Power over Traditions that are General; but that next to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self, they are kept by all Sober <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> inviolable. And St. <hi>Augustine</hi> says plainly [St. <hi>Aug. Epist.</hi> 118. <hi>c.</hi> 5.] 'tis <hi>Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentissimae insaniae; a trick of most insolent Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to dispute or doubt of that, quod tota per Orbem frequentat Ecclesia, which the Church of Christ practises throughout the whole World.</hi> And for my part I believe him; and I would my Lord did so too, and then I think he would not refuse <hi>the Service for the Injunction,</hi> nor fall into any fit of this <hi>insolent Madness.</hi> As for <hi>Preaching,</hi> that was ever left free. And therefore the Church did ever put a difference.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="494" facs="tcp:54614:259"/>
And, I find <hi>upon this Consideration,</hi> another Difference yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Prayer and Preaching.</hi> For Preaching is a Speech to Man for his Edification, and Instruction in Faith and good Life. But Prayer is a Speech to God, to Honour and Worship him, in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of his Dominion over, and his Bounty and Goodness towards all Creatures; but Mankind especially. And therefore, though a Man cannot take too much pains in that which he is to speak from God to Man, lest he be proved <hi>a False Relater:</hi> Yet of the two, there should be more care had, what Prayers he puts up for himself and the whole Congregation, unto God; lest he be not only <hi>a false Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipper;</hi> but also, lest he suddenly and unadvisedly ask that, which may be hurtful unto all. And for ought he knows, God may at that time, be angry with us for our Sins, and may hear in his anger, and grant. And I believe, it will be found, a greater and more dangerous Sin, for the Priest to make the People ask at God's Hands, those things <hi>which they ought not.</hi> Besides, <hi>the Publick Prayers</hi> of the Church, do teach and inform the People, not only how to Pray, and so how to Worship; but in many things also, what to believe, as well, nay, often times better than many <hi>Sermons.</hi> So that ill Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Publick, contains almost all the Mischiefs that ill Preaching hath in it, over and above all the Ill that is proper to it self: And so is the more dangerous Sin: And therefore the Church cannot be too careful for <hi>a set and known Form for Publick Prayer;</hi> yea, and that enjoyned too, so it be well weighed before-hand; though for Preaching she leave a greater <hi>Latitude.</hi> So upon consideration, I think there is more difference between a set Form of Prayer, and a set Form of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than that we are invited to the one, and not to the other. Yet, when I hear what <hi>Extravagant,</hi> nay <hi>Seditious</hi> Preaching there is now-a-days, I am strongly tempted to believe, that were the like Injunction for Preaching, it were far better, than that such loose, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and most unchristian Preachings, as are in many places, should continue. It seems, my Lord hath now done with the First Part of the <hi>Waspish-Man's</hi> Charge against him (for so he is pleased to call it.) And that is his Lordship's account why he refuses to come <hi>to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer.</hi> And now he goes on to the next.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>My Lords, let me presume upon your Patience, so far farther, as to give me leave, to speak to the other Imputation laid upon me; that I am a Separatist, and the greatest in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lords</hi> very Honourably afforded his Lordship Patience <hi>to speak to the other Imputation laid upon him;</hi> and so shall I very freely. But how far, and in what Language, and upon what Occasion I impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any thing to his Lordship, I have ingenuously declared already: And shall add no more, till my Lord hath proceeded farther, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed what he pleases; as follows.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>And First I shall say of this Word <hi>Separatist,</hi> as that Learned Man, Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> of <hi>Eaton</hi> saith in a little Manuscript of his, which I have seen:
<q>
                           <p>That where it may be rightly fixed, and deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly charged, it is certainly a great Offence. But in common
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:54614:259"/>
use now among us, it is no other than a Theological Scare-crow; wherewith the potent and prevalent Party uses to fright and inforce those who are not of their Opinions, to subscribe to their Dictates, without daring to question them, or bring them to any  Rule of Examination, either of Scripture or Reason.</p>
                        </q>
And he observeth, that this was too usual even in Ancient Times, as well as now.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>And First, my Lord begins with the Word <hi>Separatist:</hi> And he professes, he will say of that, as <hi>Learned Mr.</hi> Hales <hi>saith.</hi> And surely the first part of Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> is very true; That where this Word, or the Crime signified by it, <hi>is rightly fixt, and deservedly charged, 'tis a great Offence.</hi> But that which follows, by my Lord's good leave, and Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> his too, is somewhat too hard a Censure upon the <hi>Times,</hi> and the <hi>Persons</hi> living in them. The Truth is; some Men are too apt to Accuse others of Schism and Separation; but yet I do not think the Disease is so <hi>Epidemical,</hi> as 'tis here expressed. As Namely, <hi>That it is in common use amongst us.</hi> Perhaps, nothing so Common at this Time, to <hi>call</hi> Separatist as to be one. <hi>Or that it is a Theological Scare-crow, by which the potent and prevalent Party uses to affright and enforce those who are not of their Opinions, to subscribe to their Dictates.</hi> Or sure, if there be such practice, the Fault is in the <hi>Persons</hi> that use it. But even that is no Excuse at all, for <hi>Schism or Separation;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some, in an inconsiderate heat, Charge that Crime upon such as are not Guilty. For, perhaps my Lord may say as much as this, of <hi>Excommunication</hi> it self, that some are struck with it, who deserve it not; and yet, I hope, my Lord hath not proceeded so far, as to say, that <hi>Excommunication</hi> is but a <hi>Theological Scare-crow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I farther think, there are as few at this Day of them, whom my Lord calls <hi>the potent and prevalent Party, which refuse to be brought to any Rule of Examination, either of Scripture or Reason;</hi> as have lived in this Church for some Hundreds of Years past, how meanly soever this Lord Esteems them, and how <hi>narrow</hi> soever he thinks their <hi>Comprehensions</hi> are.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this Passage; my Lord tells us, <hi>that Mr.</hi> Hales <hi>observes farther, that this was too usual, even in Ancient Times, as well as now.</hi> That some Faults, and some Degrees of this Fault, were in Ancient Times, as well as now, may be true enough: And yet in those An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Times, none thought <hi>Schism</hi> or <hi>Separation from the Church,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever charged, to be but <hi>a Theological Scare-crow.</hi> But caused it to be examined to the bottom, as 'tis fit; nay, necessary, that it should: For else, the most dangerous <hi>Separation,</hi> that can be; may go away free with this. That it is but <hi>a trick of the prevalent Party, to fright other Men into their Opinions, by charging them with Separation.</hi> Now, the most <hi>dangerous Separation in a Church, is,</hi> where the Church it self hath little or no Power to punish <hi>Separatists.</hi> And where <hi>they of the Separation,</hi> are, by the great Misfortune of the State, become the potent and prevalent Party. And whether this be not, or at least were not the condition of <hi>the State and Church of</hi> England, when my Lord Printed this Speech of his; I leave to the indifferent Reader to judge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="496" facs="tcp:54614:260"/>
My Lord hath Printed no more than this; and therefore I will take notice of no more. But yet, Iam told by a very good Hand, that his Lordship upon this quotation of <hi>Mr.</hi> Hales <hi>his Manuscript,</hi> was pleased openly in that Honourable House of Parliament, where he spake it, to lend Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> one Wipe, and <hi>me</hi> another. But since my Lord is pleased to pass it over at the Press, I shall do so too. Yet with this, that if my Lord did give that Gird, I will make it plainly appear, whenever he shall publish it, that there is no shew of Truth in it. But now that my Lord hath done with Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, and tells us his own Judgment.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Secondly, I say that there is a two-fold Separation; one from the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal or Catholick Church; which can no otherwise be made, but by denying the Faith; (for Faith and Love are the Requisites to that Communion.)</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>And I say so too, that there is a two-fold Separation; and that one of them is from the <hi>Vniversal, or Catholick Church.</hi> But that this <hi>Separation can no otherwise be made, but by denying the Faith,</hi> I doubt comes short of Truth. First, because there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Schism</hi> and <hi>Apostacy.</hi> And every <hi>Apostacy</hi> is a <hi>Separation;</hi> but every <hi>Separation</hi> is not <hi>Apostacy.</hi> For a Man is not an Apostate properly, till he fall away, by denying the whole Faith. But a Man may be in <hi>Heresie, Schism and Separation;</hi> upon the denyal <hi>of any one Article of the Faith,</hi> received by <hi>the Catholick Church.</hi> Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause should a Man agree in all and every <hi>Article of the Faith,</hi> with the <hi>Catholick-Church;</hi> yet he may maintain some false <hi>Opinion,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous, both to the <hi>Verity,</hi> and the <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Universal Church: And be so in Love with these, as that for these Opinions sake, he will Separate from the whole Body.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Denyal of the Faith is not the only Cause of Separation from the Catholick Church; since this Separation can be otherways made. And, my Lord within the space of Three Lines, crosses himself. For First, he says, <hi>that this Separation can no otherwise be made, but by denying the Faith.</hi> And in the very next Words, he tells us, <hi>that Faith and Love are the Requisites to that Communion.</hi> Two Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites to that Communion with the Universal Church; therefore two Causes of Separation from it. Therefore, by my Lord's own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, he that is so out of Charity, with the Universal Church, for some Opinions or Practices which he dislikes, as that he will not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with it; is in Separation, though he do not deny the Faith.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>The other <hi>(my Lord tells us)</hi> is, a Separation from this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, or Congregation. And that not in respect of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with them, in matter of Faith or Love: But in dislike only of such Corruptions, in their external Worship and Liturgies, as they do admit of, and would enjoyn upon others.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>In this other <hi>Particular Separation,</hi> I shall meddle with neither <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi> nor <hi>Conventicle,</hi> Meeting allowed, or disallowed by Church or State; but that Separation which is, or is not made by my Lord
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:54614:260"/>
and his Followers, from <hi>the National Church of</hi> England, <hi>as it stands Setled and Established by Law.</hi> Not as her Service may be mangled, or otherwise abused in any particular <hi>Parish,</hi> or Congregation, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. And if this Lord dislike any the Service as 'tis used in some one <hi>Parish</hi> or other, and yet will come to the Service as it is Establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by Law in other, either <hi>Cathedral</hi> or <hi>Parochial</hi> Churches, my Lord hath had great Wrong, to be accounted a Separatist. But if my Lord will not come to <hi>the Prayers of the Church of</hi> England <hi>by Law Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,</hi> let his Pretence be what it will, a Separatist he is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But my Lord says,</hi> that this Particular Separation is not in respect of difference with them, in matter of Faith or Love.</p>
                  <p>Where First you may observe on the by, that in my Lord's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">1.</note> Publick Breach in <hi>Charity,</hi> as well as in <hi>Faith,</hi> may be Cause of this <hi>Separation</hi> too, as well as of that from <hi>the Vniversal or Catholick Church,</hi> before mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Next, that this particular Separation, if it be not <hi>in respect of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>in Faith or Love;</hi> in what respect is it then? Why, if we may herein believe my Lord, 'tis only in dislike <hi>of such Corruptions in their external Worship and Liturgies, as they do admit of, and would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn others.</hi> Well, First I'll pray for my Lord, that there be no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in Faith and Charity; but I do very much doubt there is. Next, either there are such Corruptions in <hi>the External Worship</hi> and <hi>Liturgies,</hi> as his Lordship hath just Cause to dislike, or there are not. If there be not, why doth he Separate from them? If there be, or probably seem to be; why doth he not complain to <hi>the King, and the Church;</hi> that these Corruptions may be considered on, and amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if Cause appear?</p>
                  <p>And this he ought to do, before he Separate. For, I hope <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> is not yet come to that pass, (though it draw on apace) that <hi>a Powerful Lay-Man or two,</hi> shall say there are Corruptions in the set Service of God, and then be Judges of such Corruptions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Nor doth <hi>the Church of</hi> England <hi>admit of Corruptions in her Liturgy, or labour to injoyn them upon others.</hi> Now my Lord tells us farther. That</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>This is a Separation not from their Persons, as they are Christians; But from their Corruptions in matter of Worship, as they are therewith defiled. And this Separation, every Man, that will keep himself Pure from other Mens Sins, and not Sin against his own Conscience, must make.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>This will not yet help my Lord: For say <hi>this be not a Separation from their Persons, as they are Christians;</hi> which yet it too often proves to be. And I believe, if this Lord would impartially examine himself, he would find to be true in himself, and his Comportment. But <hi>that it is from their Corruptions in matter of Worship, as they are therewith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed.</hi> First, these Corruptions are not proved; so 'tis <hi>Petitio Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pii,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note> the begging of that to be granted, which is the thing in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Secondly, if there be Corruptions; yet it is not proved they <note place="margin">2.</note> are in the <hi>Matter;</hi> but of the two, rather in the <hi>Manner</hi> of Worship. Thirdly, were both these granted, yet it will remain a Question still; <note place="margin">3.</note>
                     <pb n="498" facs="tcp:54614:261"/>
whether these Corruptions be such, as <hi>that the Worshippers are defiled therewith?</hi> And another Question, whether so deeply defiled, as that other good <hi>Christians</hi> shall be defiled, by coming to Common-Prayer with them? For I am not yet persuaded, nor shall be, till I be convinced, <hi>That every Man that will keep himself pure from other Mens Sins, and not Sin against his Conscience, is bound to make this Separation.</hi> For I conceive, many Corruptions may be tolerated; nay, ought to be, before a <hi>Separation</hi> be made. And that a private Conscience is to be both <hi>informed,</hi> and <hi>reformed,</hi> before it be attempted.</p>
                  <p>Nor can I think, that he which comes to the publick Service of any Church that is not <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> or peccant in the <hi>Fundamentals of Religion,</hi> doth partake with other Mens Sins, that frequent the same <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> or <hi>Service</hi> with him, or he with them.</p>
                  <p>And yet my Lord is so peremptory, as that without any distinction or Degrees of Corruption; he delivers it positively, with a great deal more Boldness than Knowledge; <hi>That every Man, that will keep himself pure from other Mens Sins, must make this Separation. Every Man,</hi> and <hi>must make.</hi> And it is not to be conceived, but that what every Man must do, my Lord, who seems to be so careful to keep himself pure from other Mens Sins, hath done already. That is, hath made this <hi>Separation</hi> from the Church. And my Lord, for ought I see, is ready to confess as much. For he adds,
<q>
                        <p>And I will ingenuously confess, that there are many things, in many Churches or Congregations in <hi>England,</hi> practised, and injoyned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all to be practised and suffered; which I cannot practise nor admit of, except I should Sin against the Light of my Conscience, until I may out of the Word of God be convinced of the Lawfulness of them; which hitherto I could never see sufficient ground for.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I told you my Lord was very near confessing as much as I have said. For he says <hi>ingenuously there are many things in many Churches in</hi> England <hi>practised.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, I told my Lord before, that this Business of Separation, was not to be judged by what is practised in one or more Parochial Congregations, but by what ought to be practised in <hi>all the Churches of</hi> England. And if my Lord dislike any thing in one Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he may go to another (so he will endure <hi>the whole Liturgy,</hi> as it is setled by Law) and no Man if he will do this, ought to account him a Separatist. And I find by my Lord's Words, that his Exception is to <hi>many Churches;</hi> and I would willingly hope (if his Carriage would let me) that he excepts not against all. Besides, he tells us, that <hi>many things</hi> are so practised; but he is not pleased to tell us what they are. And then it is not possible for me or any Man else, either to know whether his Lordship's Exception be just against them, or to give him satisfaction in them. And it is no great sign, that my Lord bears any good Mind to the Church, that he is so ready to charge <hi>many things</hi> against the Church, and to name none.</p>
                  <p>My Lord goes farther, and says plainly, that these <hi>many things</hi> thus practised, <hi>or enjoyned also, and that upon all, to be practised or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, which he cannot practise nor admit of, except he should Sin against</hi>
                     <pb n="499" facs="tcp:54614:261"/>
                     <hi>the Light of his Conscience.</hi> You have heard already, how much my Lord is troubled with this <hi>Enjoyning,</hi> and to that I refer you: In the mean time, since I am the Man so particularly shot at by my Lord, I shall answer for my self according to Truth; and with Truth I can legally prove, if need be; I have not <hi>Commanded or injoyned</hi> any one thing Ceremonial or other, upon any Parochial Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>England,</hi> much less upon all, to be either practised or suffered, but that which is directly commanded by Law.

                  <p>For it seems, my Lord stands not simply upon the Light of his Conscience; <hi>but only until he may be convinced out of the Word of God, of the Lawfulness of these things, which hitherto he could never see sufficient ground for.</hi> And this is the Common-Plea, which all of them have resort to, till they be convinced; which (as I have had experience of many) they are resolved not to be.

So there shall be no Publick Service of God; but some <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> or other, under the Name of <hi>Light in the Conscience,</hi> shall except against it, and Separate from it. Which is directly to set up the <hi>Light in each private Spirit,</hi> against <hi>that Light</hi> which God hath placed in his <hi>Church;</hi> shine it never so clearly. Yet his Lordship is confident, and says,</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>But, my Lords, this is so far from making me the greatest Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist in <hi>England,</hi> that it cannot argue me to be any at all. For my Lords the Bishops do know, that those whom they usually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this term unto, are the <hi>Brownists</hi> (as they call them by another Name) and they know their Tenents. The truth is, they differ
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:54614:262"/>
with us in no Fundamental Point of Doctrine, or saving Truth, I know.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Here then my Lord is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to say, that all that he hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to said, <hi>is so far from making him the greatest Separatist in</hi> England, <hi>that it cannot argue him to be any at all:</hi> For my part, I would to God it were so: But let's examine, whether it be so or not. First then, this I humbly conceive is certain; That he, whoever he be, that will not <hi>Communicate in Publick Prayers</hi> with a National Church, which serves God as she ought, is a <hi>Separatist.</hi> But the <hi>Church of</hi> England as it stands established by Law, serves God as she ought: Therefore my Lord, by his general absenting himself from her Communion in Prayers, is a Separatist. And this is by his own confession: For he says, a little before, and that expresly, that <hi>this is a Separation, which every Man must make, that will keep himself pure from other Mens Sins.</hi> And I cannot doubt, but his Lordship hath made that, which he says he must make.</p>
                  <p>All that can be said for my Lord herein, is this; First, That my Lord Charges the <hi>Church of</hi> England with <hi>Corruptions in the Worship of God; and such Corruptions, as he must Separate from her.</hi> But is it sufficient for a Separation for a particular Man, barely to say there are such Corruptions in the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> when he doth neither prove them to be such, nor so much as name them what they are? Surely no. And I think these Gnats (which his Lordship strains at) may be swallowed, without any Offence to God or Man. So far are they from being <hi>a just Cause of Separation:</hi> Therefore, for all this, my Lord is a Separatist.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but my Lord charges upon the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>she injoyns her Liturgy upon all Men, by a certain Number of Men usurping Authority to themselves, and imposing this Injunction, under the name of the Church.</hi> I have made answer already to <hi>this Power of the Church</hi> to compose a set Form for publick Service; and I hope made it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that this <hi>Authority is not usurped.</hi> And then that can be no just Cause of a <hi>Separation.</hi> Nay, I must doubt, whether if such Authority were usurped by some Church-Men, in any <hi>National Church,</hi> the injoyning of the Service after it is made, supposing always that it contain no <hi>Idolatry, or Fundamental Error,</hi> be for <hi>the Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction alone</hi> a sufficient Warrant to my Lord, or any other to Separate? Therefore, my Lord's forsaking the publick Service of the Church, upon no better Grounds than these, makes him a Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist by his own Confession, without any Man calling him so.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>his Lordship's being the greatest Separatist in</hi> England: I have at the beginning of this Tract clearly related, to the uttermost of my Memory, what and upon what occasion I spake of his Lordship in this kind. But whether I said it or not, my Lord, for ought I see, will hardly escape being so. For he is the <hi>greatest Separatist</hi> from the Church, that absents himself with <hi>most will</hi> and <hi>least cause:</hi> And this, if I mistake not, is my Lord's Case; for he separates with <hi>most will,</hi> that says <hi>Men must and ought to Separate:</hi> And <hi>upon least Cause,</hi> because as yet he hath Named none at all; but <hi>Corruptions</hi> in general; which any Man may say; and <hi>the Injunction of a set Form,</hi> which is no cause.
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:54614:262"/>
Therefore (for ought I yet see) it may truly be said of his Lordship, that <hi>he is the greatest Separatist in</hi> England.</p>
                  <p>Especially if you add to this, how busie and active his Lordship is, and for many Years hath been, to promote this Cause of <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> And I have some very good grounds to think, that his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship hath been and is the great <hi>Cause,</hi> and <hi>enlarger</hi> of all <hi>the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that now is in Church Affairs. And of all the <hi>Disobedience</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by bred or cherished against <hi>Soveraign Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next, my Lord appeals to my Lords the Bishops; and tells them, <hi>that they know that they whom they usually apply this Name</hi> (Separatist) <hi>unto, are the</hi> Brownists, <hi>as they call them by another Name.</hi> I know not all things, which the rest of my Learned Brethren the <hi>Bishops</hi> know. Yet, I think, both they and I know this, that the Name <hi>Separatist,</hi> is a common Name to all <hi>Hereticks</hi> or <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> that separate for their Opinions sakes, either from the <hi>Catholick,</hi> or from any <hi>particular Orthodox Church.</hi> And if my Lord himself (who it seems is well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them) or any of my Lords the Bishops do know, <hi>that this Name is usually applyed to the</hi> Brownists; be it so. That I am sure is not material, unless it be for that which my Lord closes this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage withal.</p>
                  <p>Namely, that <hi>my Lords the Bishops know the Tenents of the</hi> Brownists; <hi>and that the truth is, they differ from us in no Fundamental Point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or Saving Truth that his Lordship knows.</hi> I doubt not but my Lords the <hi>Bishops</hi> know <hi>the Tenents of the Brownists,</hi> so far forth at least, as they be <hi>Tenents,</hi> and not varied from; and so far as they are their <hi>General Tenents,</hi> to which all or most of them agree. And so far as they are <hi>plain and univocal Tenents,</hi> and not such as shall equivocate with the very Faith it self. But <hi>such Tenents of the</hi> Brownists <hi>as these are,</hi> it may be, all my Lords the <hi>Bishops</hi> know not.</p>
                  <p>Now if the Truth be, as my Lord says it is, <hi>for ought he knows,</hi> that <hi>the</hi> Brownists <hi>differ from us in no Fundamental Point of Doctrine, or saving Truth:</hi> Then out of all doubt <hi>Majus peccatum habent,</hi> their Sin (and my Lord's too) is the greater, that they will so Unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, and with so great Heat and setled Violence, and to the great scandal of Religion, first <hi>separate themselves</hi> from, and now labour utterly to overthrow that Church, which (by my Lord's own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession here) differs not from them <hi>in any Fundamental Point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or saving Truth.</hi> For sure, if they differ not from us, we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not from them. But this is only <hi>Argumentum ad Hominem,</hi> and is sufficient to convince this Lord, I think, in his own way.</p>
                  <p>But I doubt the <hi>Truth</hi> is quite another thing. Namely, that the <hi>Church of England</hi> is very <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and that the <hi>Brownists</hi> or <hi>Separatists,</hi> call them as you will, do <hi>Separate</hi> upon false and unchristian Opinions. And that besides Matters of Opinion and breach of Charity, they do differ from us <hi>in some Fundamental Points of Doctrine and saving Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Lord a little before tells us <hi>of Corruptions in the Liturgy of the Church;</hi> but names none. And should I charge the <hi>Brownists,</hi> with <hi>difference from the Church in Fundamental Points of Doctrine,</hi> and yet name none, I should run into the same fault for which I there taxed my Lord: I shall therefore give some Instances of some of their <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi> and then leave the indifferent <hi>Reader</hi> to judge, whether they
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:54614:263"/>
                     <hi>do not differ from us in some Fundamental Points of Doctrine and saving Truth.</hi> And then consequently, whether it be not an <hi>Heretical,</hi> as well as <hi>a Schismatical Separation,</hi> which they make from the <hi>Church of England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. And first, there was a <hi>Creed</hi> Printed by <hi>John Turner,</hi> in this present Year, and the <hi>Parliament</hi> sitting. This <hi>Turner</hi> is a Notorious <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi> or <hi>Brownist</hi> if you will. In this Creed of his, he leaves out <hi>the descent of Christ into Hell.</hi> This is an <hi>Article of the Apostle's Creed.</hi> And 'tis an Article of the <hi>Church of England.</hi> And so I presume <hi>a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Point of Doctrine.</hi> Yet herein, this <hi>Brownist</hi> and his Fellows differ from us. And I have heard from some present, that at <hi>a Committee of Lords,</hi> appointed for Matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> a <note n="*" place="margin">The Lord <hi>Brook.</hi>
                     </note> young Lord should say openly and boldly enough, that he did not believe <hi>the descent of Christ into Hell.</hi> And that my Lord, the Author of this <hi>Speech,</hi> should second him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the same Creed, <hi>Turner</hi> professes, he believes <hi>that Christ In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by his Apostles certain particular Churches here on Earth, and no other.</hi> So the Catholick Church, the Mother of all particular, both Men and Churches, and out of which there can be no Salvation in the ordinary way, is quite thrust out of this <hi>Brownist's Creed.</hi> And this I hope is another <hi>Fundamental Point of Doctrine and saving Truth.</hi> But in this I must do my Lord right, and not charge him with this point. Because a little before, his Lordship tells of <hi>a two-fold Separation, one whereof he says is from the Vniversal or Catholick Church.</hi> So the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church</hi> is not yet thrust out of my <hi>Lord's Creed.</hi> But then this appears, that the <hi>Separatists</hi> are not yet agreed upon all the Articles of their <hi>Creed.</hi> Nay, some of them call the Apostle's Creed <hi>a patched For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery.</hi> And <hi>Barrow</hi> justifies it. <note place="margin">Barrow's <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to</hi> Gifford, p. 255.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, they differ from us in charging <hi>gross Corruptions</hi> upon <hi>the Church of England.</hi> And these <hi>are known to my Lord;</hi> for he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges them; and so gross, that, should they be true, the Church of <hi>England</hi> must be faulty <hi>in Fundamental and Saving Truth.</hi> As shall farther appear in my Answer to my Lord's next Passage. Therefore <note place="margin">
                        <hi>p.</hi> 48.</note> if their Charge be true, they must, by my Lord's own Confession, differ from us <hi>in Fundamental and saving Truth.</hi> And if their Charge be false, why do they separate from us? Besides, all <hi>Anabaptists</hi> and <hi>Brownists</hi> agree in this, <hi>that the Church of</hi> England <hi>is Antichristian.</hi> And if it be so, they must either differ in <hi>Fundamentals</hi> from the Church of <hi>England:</hi> Or be <hi>Antichristian</hi> themselves in joyning with them: Or grant, that <hi>Christ and Antichrist</hi> have one and the same Foundation.</p>

                     </note> these Troubles of the Church) says expresly; <hi>Let any true Saint of God be taken away in the very act of any known Sin, before it is possible for him to Repent; I make no doubt or Scruple of it, but he shall as surely be saved as if he had lived to have repented of it. And he instances in</hi> David, <hi>in case he had been taken away, before he had repented of his Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and Murther.</hi> So according to this Divinity, the true Saints of God may commit horrible and carying Sins, dye without Repentance, and yet be sure of Salvation; which teareth up the very Foundations of Religion; induceth all manner of Profaneness into the World; and is expresly contrary to the whole current of the <note n="†" place="margin">Ezech. <hi>18. 26.</hi> Prov. <hi>28. 13.</hi> S.

                  <p n="10">10.

                        </gap> from us in some fundamental points of Doctrine, or</hi>

                     <hi>saving Truth.</hi> And as these are in fault for their Separation; so I doubt the Church is to blame, for not proceeding against such of them as are altogether incorrigible.</p>
                  <p>But whether my Lord thinks these to be Fundamental Points; or whether he know, that the <hi>Brownists</hi> do differ from us in them; I shall not take on me to declare, till his Lordship open himself far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In the mean time, his Lordship goes on to tell us, wherein these <hi>Brownists</hi> fail, though they do not differ in <hi>Fundamental Points to his Knowledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Their failing is in this. They hold that there is no true Church in <hi>England,</hi> no true Ministry, no true Worship which depend the one upon the other; they say all is <hi>Antichristian.</hi> Here is their Error; they distinguish not between the <hi>bene esse</hi> or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a true Church; and the <hi>esse</hi> or true being of it, though with many Defects and gross Corruptions. But conclude, because such things are wanting, which are indeed necessary to the well-being of a true Church, and to be desired; therefore there is none at all in being.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Here my Lord shews a great deal of sharp and good Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. And distinguishes very rightly between <hi>the entire being of a true Church,</hi> which is her <hi>bene esse;</hi> and the <hi>true Being of a Church,</hi> which is her <hi>esse</hi> only. And my Lord doth farther fairly acknowledge, that this is the <hi>Brownists</hi> Error, To conclude no Church in being, because it hath many Defects and gross Corruptions in it to hinder its well-being.</p>
                  <p>So then, my Lord here grants two things.</p>
                  <p>First, that <hi>to hold there is no True Church in</hi> England, <hi>no True Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, no true Worship</hi> (which depend one upon another) <hi>but that all is Antichristian;</hi> is an Error.</p>
                  <p>And Secondly, that it is <hi>the Brownists</hi> Error. How, and how far these Three: No True Church; no True Ministry; no True Worship depend one upon another: And in what cases it may in some Exigents be otherways, I will not now dispute, nor divert from the main Business.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. First then, if it be an Error to say, there is no True Church, no True Ministry, no True Worship in <hi>England.</hi> Then, I hope, it will be found Truth to say, there is <hi>a True Church, a True Ministry, and a True Worship in</hi> England. And he that shall avow the contrary, must needs differ from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in Fundamentals. For these Contradictions; a True Church, and no True Church; a True Ministry, and no True Ministry; a True Worship of God, and no True Worship; cannot be built up but upon different <hi>Foundations.</hi> And as for that, which my Lord affirms, is added by the <hi>Brownists,</hi> That there are many Defects and gross Corruptions in it: So long as this is said, and not proved; 'tis enough, without farther Proof to deny, both the <hi>Defects</hi> and <hi>Corruptions,</hi> both the <hi>many</hi> and the <hi>gross.</hi> As I doubt not but the Church of <hi>England</hi> can make good against, both my Lord, and all the <hi>Brownists</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>

fain know of my Lord, how he can say <hi>the Brownists do not differ from or with us, in any fundamental Point of Doctrine or saving Truth?</hi> For if this be no <hi>fundamental Point,</hi> or no <hi>saving Truth;</hi> that we be <hi>in, and of a true Church;</hi> that this Church hath a <hi>true Ministry,</hi> to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us, in all the Duties of their Function; whether up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to God in <hi>Prayer and Spiritual Sacrifice,</hi> or downward to us in the <hi>Word and Sacraments;</hi> that in this <hi>Church,</hi> and by this <hi>Ministry,</hi> there is <hi>a true Worship,</hi> and that without <hi>gross Corruptions:</hi> What can be accounted, next <hi>the Creed</hi> it self, <hi>fundamental</hi> or saving? So that in one Line, my Lord is pleased to say, <hi>the Brownists do not differ with us in any fundamental Point of Doctrine, or saving Truth;</hi> and in the very next Line, his Lordship confesses, they differ from us in these three things, which if not several, yet altogether, as they depend one upon another, <hi>are saving and fundamental.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor can this cautelous close help my Lord one jot, that he adds; <hi>The Brownists do not differ from us in any fundamental point of Doctrine or saving Truth, as his Lordship knows.</hi> For were his Lordship of <hi>a shallow, or narrow Comprehension,</hi> 'twere another matter: But since he is so full of understanding in these things, 'tis impossible but he must know these three together are fundamental; and being so, he must needs know also, that <hi>the Brownists differ with us in Fundamentals;</hi> which is that which he denyed. If therefore my Lord will say, he knows not this <hi>to be the Brownists Error,</hi> why doth he take upon him to say it is? If he will grant, that <hi>he knows it,</hi> he must needs know withal (if he will not shut out <hi>the Light of his Conscience,</hi> of which a little before he is so tender) that <hi>the Brownists, or Separatists,</hi> call them what you will, <hi>differ from us in some fundamental Points of Doctrine or saving Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus far then my Lord relates the failing of the <hi>Brownist.</hi> I hope he will be so careful as not to fail with them himself. Yes sure; for he adds;</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>I hold no such Opinion; but do believe to the contrary: That there are in <hi>England</hi> many true Churches, and a true Ministry which I do hear, and with which Churches I could joyn in Communion, were those Yokes of Bondage, which are laid upon them, taken off, and those Corruptions removed, which they do (contrary, as I think, to their Duty) yield unto, and admit of: And this I am sure, no Separatist in <hi>England</hi> holds, that deserves that Name. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope your Lordships will in that respect let me stand right in your Opinions.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Here my Lord tells us, <hi>he holds no such Opinion, but does believe to the contrary.</hi> But I doubt, he so believes to the <hi>contrary,</hi> as that he is of the <hi>same Opinion.</hi> For he believes, <hi>that there are in</hi> England, <hi>many true Churches, and a true Ministry.</hi> And so do all the <hi>Brownists:</hi> For no doubt, but they believe, that all their Congregations or Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, <hi>are true Churches in</hi> England; and that the Ministers which they hear are <hi>true Ministers.</hi> And this is plainly my Lord's Belief. For he saith, he believes there is a true Ministry <hi>in</hi> England, <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>he doth hear.</hi> But what Ministers they are, which he doth hear, he does not say.</p>
                  <p>Or if this be not my Lord's meaning; but that there <hi>are some true Churches, and some true Ministers in</hi> England, though ordained as in <hi>England</hi> they are; yet my Lord continues <hi>a Separatist</hi> still. For his Lordship doth not say, either that <hi>he doth,</hi> or that <hi>he will,</hi> or that <hi>he can</hi> joyn in Communion with any of <hi>these Churches,</hi> or <hi>this Ministry,</hi> which he says, are <hi>true.</hi> But only that <hi>he could joyn with them, if;</hi> If what? Why, <hi>if these Yokes of Bondage were taken off, which are laid upon them, and those Corruptions removed.</hi> By the Yokes of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, he means <hi>the Injunction of a set Form of Prayers,</hi> which he hath so often mentioned in this <hi>Speech.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what <hi>Corruptions</hi> he means, I know not, till his Lordship shall be pleased to tell us. Only this I conceive I may add; That all things are not Corruptions in the Church, which my Lord calls so. That if <hi>these Corruptions be fundamental,</hi> they may be such too, as may keep these Churches which he speaks of, from being <hi>true Churches,</hi> and the Ministry from being a <hi>true Ministry.</hi> But if these <hi>Corruptions</hi> be of a very light Allay, (as I verily believe they are, if there be any) then his Lordship ought not to <hi>separate,</hi> but <hi>to joyn in Communion with them;</hi> for all these, either <hi>Yokes, or Corruptions.</hi> The Apostle indeed tells us of <hi>a Church without Wrinkle,</hi> Ephes. 5. But that is a <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant</hi>

                     <hi>Church</hi> in Heaven; not a <hi>Militant</hi> upon Earth. And for the Yokes, which my Lord speaks of, they are not <hi>Yokes</hi> of Bondage, as he pleases to call them; <hi>but Yokes of Obedience,</hi> which, whenever they shall be broken, <hi>the wild Asses</hi> of the Wilderness, will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 24.</note> all.</p>
                  <p>My Lord goes farther, and says; That in these true Churches, this true Ministry does yield unto, and admit of these Yokes, and these Corruptions, <hi>contrary, as he thinks, to their Duty.</hi> But it seems, they think not so; or if they do think so, why do they not remonstrate their Grievance? Sure, if their <hi>Conscience</hi> tell them they do against their <hi>Duty,</hi> they ought to <hi>inform</hi> their Conscience, or <hi>forbear</hi> the Work. To <hi>inform</hi> their <hi>Conscience,</hi> I am sure is fit for them, if they need it. Though it seems, my Lord would rather have them <hi>forbear</hi> the Duty, the doing whereof, he calls their <hi>yielding unto;</hi> and their <hi>admitting</hi> these things, which he calls <hi>Yokes and Corruptions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for that which follows, and which my Lord says <hi>he is sure of, that no Separatist in</hi> England <hi>that deserves that Name, holds that which his Lordship says here he doth believe.</hi> In that also, I conceive his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is utterly mistaken. For, I believe, there is no <hi>Separatist in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Brownist,</hi> or other <hi>deserving that Name;</hi> but he holds, and will say as much as my Lord believes, namely, <hi>that there are in</hi> England <hi>many true Churches,</hi> that is, Assemblies, or Congregations of their own Brotherhood. <hi>And a true Ministry:</hi> To wit, those which themselves have made. And that they do hear them; that is, such as these. Yea, <hi>and that they could joyn in Communion with some other Churches, were those Yokes of Bondage, which are layd upon them, taken off, and those Corruptions removed.</hi> That is, upon the matter, if they would become as themselves are, then they would joyn with them. And this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>Yoeks, nor admit of such Corruptions.</hi> So that my Lord may see every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

                     </gap> in <hi>England,</hi> even they, which most deserve that Name, hold that which his Lordship believes. And therefore no question can be made, but that my Lord deserves that Name, as much as any of them, even while he says, <hi>he is sure no Separatist in</hi> England <hi>that deserves that Name, holds as he doth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to come to the quick. The <hi>Brownists</hi> and <hi>Separatists</hi> deal plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with God and the World, and say expresly, that the whole <hi>Church of England,</hi> as it stands established by Law, is peccant, both in the <hi>Doctrine, Liturgy, and Discipline</hi> of it; and in such a degree, as that they neither will, nor can joyn in Communion with it: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore separate from it, and betake themselves to their own private Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Congregations. But my Lord he <hi>Equivocates</hi> both with God and Man: And tells us, <hi>he believes there are true Churches in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>and a true Ministry which he hears.</hi> And this no <hi>Separatist</hi> that understands himself, but will say as fast as he. But let his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship come home to the Business directly and plainly: Let him say, that <hi>the Church of</hi> England <hi>is a true Church;</hi> That the Ministry of it, <hi>is a true Ministry;</hi> That the <hi>Doctrine, Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> of it, as it stands established now by Law, are free from any <hi>such Corruptions</hi> as give just cause for a Separation.</p>
                  <p>And when he hath said this, let him joyn in Communion with it as he ought to do; and then he shall wrong my Lord very deeply, that says he is a <hi>Separatist.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But for all this which he hath yet said for himself, 'tis manifest, that <hi>a Separatist</hi> he is. And I doubt, hath hereby proved himself, whether I will or no, the greatest Separatist in <hi>England.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath little cause <hi>to hope</hi> (as he says he doth) <hi>that he shall stand right in their Lordships Opinions,</hi> or any other Man's, that is not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest with the same Humour. Yet, my Lord hath two Requests to make.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>I will now end with two Requests: The one, that your Lordships will please to pardon me, for troubling you with so long a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course concerning my self. I have not used it heretofore; and I am not like to offend again in the same kind. It is but once, and your Lordships will consider the occasion.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>In this Suit, were there need, I would joyn with my Lord. For though I have a great deal of hard Measure put upon me in this <hi>Speech;</hi> yet I have the more reason to be content with it, because this whole Discourse of my Lord's, well weighed, is more against himself than me. And such Trouble of his Lordship's, I hope all Men well affected to the present <hi>Church of England,</hi> will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily Pardon. And this I doubt not, but their Lordships, and all Men else, will the rather do, <hi>when they consider the Occasion.</hi> Which certainly I gave not personally in the <hi>House:</hi> But a Guilty Conscience (it seems) would needs be meant.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>The Second (<hi>Request</hi>) is to entreat of you, that where you know there is one and the same God worshipped, one and the same Faith
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:54614:266"/>
embraced, one and the same Spirit working Love, and causing an unblamable Conversation, without any offence to the State, in your Brethren, who in all these concur with you; you will not suffer them, (for Ceremonies and Things indifferent to you, but not to them but Burthens, which without offence to the State, or prejudice to the Churches you may take off if you will) to be thrust out of the Land and cut off from their Native Country. For if you thus shall wound the Consciences of your Brethren, you will certainly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and sin against <hi>Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </q>
                  <p>In this second Request, I can easily agree with my Lord in some things; but must differ in other. And First, I agree with all my <note place="margin">1.</note> Heart, that I would have no pressure at all; much less <hi>cutting off from their Native Country,</hi> put upon them, who <hi>are known to worship the same God, to embrace one and the same Faith, and one and the same Spirit working Love.</hi> But in this I must disagree, that the <hi>Separatists,</hi> (for they are the Men of whom this Lord speaks thus, and <hi>says they are your Brethren, and concur with you in all these</hi>) are not known to be such. For though he be one and the same God whom they worship, yet the Worship is not one and the same. For my Lord says plainly, <hi>that our set Forms are Superstition:</hi> And that he cannot joyn in Communion with us, <hi>till our yokes of Bondage, and our other gross Corruptions be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</hi> And I must doubt <hi>they embrace not the same Faith,</hi> till they admit <hi>the whole Creed,</hi> and will use the <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> which few of them will. As <hi>for the Spirit that works by Love,</hi> I much fear he is a great stranger to many of these Men. For I have many ways found their Malice to be fierce, and yet endless. And therefore I wonder my Lord should have the Boldness to tell <hi>my Lords in Parliament,</hi> that <hi>they know</hi> all these things of these Men, <hi>and that they are their Brethren and concur with them in all these forenamed things;</hi> whom in the mean time, their Lordships do, and cannot but <hi>know,</hi> different from them; nay sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating from them, in the very Worship of God.</p>
                  <p>Next I agree with my Lord again, that I would have no pressure put <note place="margin">2.</note> upon those Men, <hi>in whom the Spirit of Love causes an unblamable Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, without any offence to the State.</hi> But in this I must disagree, that the <hi>Separatists</hi> from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are such manner of Men. For the private Conversation of very many of them (whom I could name, were it fit,) is far from being unblamable. <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 line">
                           <desc>〈1 line〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Publick Conversation</hi> of all, or most of them, <hi>is full of offence to the State:</hi> Unless my Lord think <hi>the State</hi> is or ought to be of their Humour. For how can their Conversation be without great offence, very great, to this or any State <hi>Christian;</hi> who shall have and maintain <hi>private Conventicles</hi> and Meetings, in a different way <hi>of Religion,</hi> from that which is Established by the State? Nay, which shall not only differ from, but openly and slanderously oppose that
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:54614:266"/>
which is so Established? Besides, <hi>no well governed State</hi> will allow of private Meetings, especially under pretence of Religion (which carry far) without their privity and allowance. For if this be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there lies a way open to all Conspiracies against the State whatsoever, and they shall all be satisfied under the pretence of Religion.</p>
                  <p>The third thing in which I agree with my Lord is, that I would <note place="margin">3.</note> not, that <hi>for Ceremonies and Things indifferent, these Men should be thrust out of the Land, and cut off from their Native Country.</hi> No, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid; if any thing will reclaim them. But then I must disagree with my Lord in this, That these Men (whether such as my Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes them or no) <hi>are thrust out of the Land,</hi> or <hi>cut off from their Native Country, for Ceremonies or Things indifferent.</hi> For First, they are not all <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> for which <hi>they separate</hi> from the Church. For they pretend certain <hi>gross Corruptions in the very Worship of God</hi> (as my Lord a little before delivers.) Secondly, be the Cause what it will, none of them have been <hi>banished,</hi> or <hi>thrust out of the Land,</hi> or <hi>cut from their Native Country</hi> (as is here spoken to move Hatred against the Government.) But 'tis true, they have thrust <hi>themselves out,</hi> and <hi>cut themselves off,</hi> and run a Madding to <hi>New England,</hi> scar'd away (as they say) by certain <hi>gross Corruptions,</hi> not to be endured in this Church. Nor after they have gone a Madding enough, is their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn denyed to any: And I know some that went out like <hi>Fools,</hi> and are come back so like—that you cannot know the one from the other.</p>
                  <p>In this Passage 'tis said by my Lord, <hi>that these Ceremonies and Things</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>indifferent unto you,</hi> (speaking to the Lords in Parliament) <hi>are not so to them, but Burthens.</hi> In this Passage I can agree with my Lord in nothing. For First, my Lord but a very little before, tells <hi>of Yokes of Bondage and gross Corruptions.</hi> And are they so soon become but <hi>Ceremonies and Things indifferent?</hi> If they be more than <hi>Ceremonies and Things indifferent,</hi> then my Lord delivers not the whole Truth. And if they be but <hi>Ceremonies and Things indifferent,</hi> then his Lordship and all other <hi>Separatists,</hi> ought rather to yield to the Church in such things, than for such things to <hi>separate</hi> from it. And certainly so they would, <hi>if the Spirit that worketh by Love,</hi> did work in them. Yea, but my Lord says, they are such things, as <hi>though they be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to others, yet to them they are not,</hi> but <hi>burthens.</hi> And it may be, they make them so; for in their own Nature they are nothing less: And of great use they are to preserve the Substance and the Body of Religion. But this I find; let any thing in the World be <hi>enjoyned</hi> by the Church Authority, and it is a Burthen presently. And so you see all along this <hi>Speech,</hi> how earnest my Lord is, in behalf of himself and <hi>these Separatists,</hi> against all <hi>Injunctions of set Forms, and Yokes of Bondage.</hi> This is an excellent way of Religion, to settle Temporal Obedience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And I can as little agree with that which follows. Namely,</hi> that <note place="margin">5.</note> the Lords may without any Offence to the State, or prejudice to the Churches, take away, if they will, these Things indifferent to them; but Burthens to these Brethren. <hi>For First, suppose them to be but</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="510" facs="tcp:54614:267"/>
                     <hi>indifferent;</hi> yet can they not be taken away <hi>without offence to the State, or prejudic to the Churches;</hi> who to please a few unruly <hi>Separatists,</hi> must make an Alteration in that part of <hi>Religion,</hi> which hath continued with great Happiness to this Church, ever since <hi>the Reformation.</hi> Secondly, I will not dispute it here, what Power a <hi>Lay Assembly</hi> (and such a Parliament is) hath to determine Matters of Religion, Prime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Originally by and of themselves, before the Church hath first agreed upon them. Then indeed they may <hi>confirm</hi> or <hi>refuse.</hi> And this course was held in the <hi>Reformation.</hi> But <hi>Originally</hi> to take this Power over <hi>Religion,</hi> into Lay Hands, is that which hath not been thus assumed, since <hi>Christ</hi> to these unhappy days. And I pray God this Chair of Religion, do not prove <hi>Cathedra Pestilentiae,</hi> as the vulgar reads it <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 1. to the infecting of this whole Nation with <hi>Schism</hi> and <hi>Heresie,</hi> and in the end bring all to confusion.</p>
                  <p>I meddle not here with <hi>the King's Power.</hi> For he may be present in <hi>Convocation</hi> when he pleases, and take or leave any Canons, as he pleases, which are for the Peace and well Ordering of the Church; as well as in <hi>Parliament,</hi> take or leave any Laws made ready for him, for the good and quiet of his People. But if it come to be Matter of Faith, though in his Absolute Power he may do what he will, and Answer God for it after: Yet he cannot commit the ordering of that to any <hi>Lay Assembly, Parliament,</hi> or other; for them to determine that, which God hath intrusted into the Hands of his Priests. Though if he will do this, the Clergy must do their Duty, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him, and help that dangerous Error if they can. But if they cannot, they must suffer an unjust Violence, how far soever it proceed; but they may not break the Duty of their <hi>Allegiance.</hi>

                  <p>I cannot but remember a very Prudent <hi>Speech</hi> utter'd in the beginning of the late preceding <hi>Parliament,</hi> and by that Lord who now made this. The occasion was. A Lord offer'd to deliver a Message from <hi>the King</hi> before he was formally brought into the House, and his <hi>Patent</hi> shew'd. This Lord, who thinks <hi>Church-Ceremonies</hi> may so easily be alter'd, stood up and said: <hi>He would not be against the delivery of the Message; he knew not how urgent it might be; but desired withal, that it might be enter'd, that this was yielded unto by Special leave of the House. For that</hi> (saith he) <hi>though this be but a Ceremony, yet the Honour and Safety of the Priviledges of this Great House, is preserved by nothing more, than by keeping the Ancient Rights and Ceremonies thereof intire.</hi> And this I think was very wisely spoken, and with great Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And could my Lord see this in the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and can he not see it in the <hi>Church?</hi> Are Ancient Ceremonies, the chief Props of <hi>Parliamentary Rights;</hi> and have they no use in <hi>Religion,</hi> to keep up her Dignity; yea perhaps, and Truth too? The <hi>House of Parliament,</hi> is, I confess; a Great and Honourable House. But the whole Church of <hi>Christ</hi> is greater. And it will not well beseem a <hi>Parliament</hi> to maintain their own <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and to kick down the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the <hi>National Church,</hi> which, under God, made all their Members <hi>Christians.</hi> Most sure I am, they cannot do it, without ossence both to <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> and making both a Scorn to Neighbouring Nations.</p>
                  <p>Now in the close of all, my Lord tells his Fellow <hi>Peers,</hi> and all others in them, <hi>That if they shall thus wound the Consciences of their Brethren,</hi> (the Separatists) <hi>they will certainly offend and sin against Christ.</hi> Soft and fair. But what shall these Lords do, if to Humour the <hi>Consciences of those Brethren</hi> (some weak, and many wilful, and the cunning misleading the simple) they shall disgrace and weaken, and perhaps, overthrow the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion they profess? Shall they not then, both wound their <hi>own Consciences, and most certainly sin against Christ?</hi> Yes, out of all doubt, they shall do both. Now, where it comes to <hi>the wounding of Consciences,</hi> no question can be made, but that every Man ought first to look to <hi>his own;</hi> to his <hi>Brethrens</hi> after. A Man must not do that which shall justly wound his <hi>Brother's</hi> Conscience, though he be his <hi>Brother in a Separation,</hi> and stand never so much a-loof from him. But he must not wound <hi>his own,</hi> to preserve his <hi>Brother</hi> from a wound; especially such a one as happily may cure him, and by a timely pinch make him sensible of the ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in which he is.</p>
                  <p>As for these Men, God of his Mercy give them that <hi>Light</hi> of his Truth, which they want; and forgive them the boasting of <hi>that Light,</hi> which they presume they have. And give them true <hi>Repentance,</hi> and in that Sense, <hi>a wounded Conscience,</hi> for their breaking the Peace of this Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="513" facs="tcp:54614:268"/>
And forgive them all their Sins, by which they still go on with more and more violence to distract this Church.</p>
                  <p>And God of his Infinite Goodness preserve this Church at all times, and especially at this time, while the Waves of <hi>this Sea of Separation</hi> rage so horribly. And as for this Lord, God forgive him, and I do, and I hope this Church will. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <item>1: That in all Parishes the Afternoon Sermons may be turned into Catechizing by Questions and Answers, when, and wheresoever there is no great cause apparent to break this ancient and profitable Order.</item>
                        <item>2: That every Bishop Ordain in his Diocess, that every Lecturer do read Divine Service according to the Liturgy Printed by Authority, in his Surplice and Hood, before the Lecture.</item>

                     </list>
                     <p n="6">VI: That the Bishops do countenance and encourage the Grave and Orthodox Divines of their Clergy; and that they use means by some of their Clergy, that they may have knowledge, how both Lecturers and Preachers behave themselves in their Sermons within their Diocess. That so they may take Order for any abuse accordingly.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII: That the Bishops suffer none but Noblemen, and Men quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Learning, to have any Private Chaplain in his House.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII: That they take special Care, that Divine Service be duly fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented; as well for Prayers and Catechizing, as for Sermons: And take particular note of all such as absent themselves as Recusants, or otherwise.</p>

                     <p>THE Year is at an end; <hi>redit Orbis in Orbem, &amp; moritura ruit perituri Machina Mundi.</hi> But the Account of the Church Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs for the last Year must not be forgotten.</p>
                     <p>To speak generally unto the <hi>Articles</hi> heretosore propounded by your Majesty; it is enough to say, that the Bishops, for ought it appeareth unto me, have lived at home; and in their Episcopal-Houses: Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only my Lord of St. <hi>Davids;</hi> who by his Wives Sickness, but especially by a Law Suit, which concerneth him for all that he hath, as he informeth, was constrained to keep here. But now that vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Suit being ended, he promiseth to repair home, and there to reside; that there shall be no just Occasion of Complaint against him.</p>
                     <p>Of Arminian Points there is no dispute: And Ordinations of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, for ought that I can learn, are Canonically observed: The Rules for Lecturers are strictly kept.</p>
                     <p>Care is had, that Divine Service is Religiously read and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; saving by certain Separatists about <hi>London,</hi> who for their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are contemptible, but fit to be punished for their wilful Obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; which we do with Moderation: Yet yielding them Means to confer with Learned Men, which we hope will prevail with some of them. And so it may be said of the rest of the Articles, that I find no noted Transgression of them.</p>
                     <p>There is not in the Church of <hi>England</hi> left any inconformable Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, which appeareth: And yet the Lord Bishops of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Lincoln</hi> have been forced to deprive Two or Three, whom no time can Tame, nor Instruction conquer, according to the rule, <hi>Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabile Vulnus Ense recidendum est.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There was one <hi>Burges,</hi> a Physician, who opened his Mouth wide against the repairing of St: <hi>Pauls</hi> Church; but he hath been so casti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, that, as I trust, very few others will be encouraged to walk in his ways, and to Blaspheme so Holy a Work.</p>
                     <p>There hath been these Two last Years past, mention made of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists frequenting <hi>Holy-Well</hi> or St. <hi>Winifred's</hi> Well in <hi>Wales;</hi> and the Bishop of St: <hi>Asaph</hi> doth not forget to touch it again in these Words: <hi>There hath been there all this Summer more than ordinary concourse of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and more bold and open practice of Superstition.</hi> Where it is not to be forgotten, that at that Well a great part of the Powder Treason
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:54614:272"/>
was hatched: And therefore my humble Opinion is, that serious Letters should be directed from your Majesty or Privy Council, to the Lord President of <hi>Wales</hi> and his Fellow Commissioners, that at Summer next, some course should be taken for the repressing of this Conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, being indeed no better than a Pilgrimage.</p>
                     <p>The Lady <hi>Wotton</hi> in <hi>Kent</hi> hath set up a bold Epitaph upon her Lord's Tomb, and will not be perswaded to take it down. We have therefore called her into the High-Commission, where, by excuse of Sickness, she hath not yet appeared: But at the next Term (God willing) we intend to proceed with her; which is but necessary, for the avoiding of Scandal in the Country.</p>
                     <p>These few, are the most observable things, whereof I can give your Majesty any reckoning: And if there were any thing else worthy the reporting, I should not conceal it. But there being nothing more, it may be the great comfort of your Majesty, that in so large and diffuse a Multitude both of Men and Matters, upon strict Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is so little exorbitancy to be found.</p>

                     <p n="1">I: That the Lords the Bishops respectively be commanded to their several Sees, there to keep Residence; excepting those who are in necessary Attendance at our Court.</p>

                        <pb n="521" facs="tcp:54614:272"/>
II: That none of them Reside upon his Land or Lease that he hath Purchased, nor on his <hi>Commendam,</hi> if he hold any; but in one of his Episcopal Houses. And that he wast not the Woods where any are left.</p>
                     <p n="3">III: That they give Charge in their Triennial Visitations, and at other convenient times, both by themselves, and the Arch-Deacons; that our Declaration for setling all Questions in difference, be strictly observed by all Parties.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV: That there be a special care taken by them all, that their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations be Solemn, and not of unworthy Persons.</p>
                     <p n="5">V: That they likewise take great care concerning the Lecturers within their several Diocesses; for whom we give the special Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections following.</p>
                     <q>
                        <list>
                           <item>1: That in all Parishes, the Afternoon Sermons be turned into Catechizing by Question and Answer; when, and whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is not some great Cause apparent to break this ancient and profitable Order.</item>
                           <item>2: That every Bishop take care in his Diocess, that all Lecturers do read Divine Service according to the Liturgy Printed by Authority, in their Surplices and Hoods, before the Lecture.</item>
                           <item>3: That where a Lecture is set up in a Market-Town, it may be read by a Company of Grave and Orthodox Divines, near adjoyning, and of the same Diocess; and that they ever Preach in such seemly Habits as belong to their Degrees; and not in Cloaks.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>That if a Corporation do maintain a single Lecturer, he be not suffered to Preach, till he profess his willingness to take upon him a Living with Cure of Souls within that Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and he do actually take such Benefice or Cure, so soon as it shall be fairly procured for him.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p n="6">VI: That the Bishops do countenance and encourage the Grave and Orthodox Divines of their Clergy, and that they use means by some of the Clergy, or others, to have knowledge, how both Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturers and Preachers within their several Diocesses behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their Sermons; that so they may take present Order for any abuse accordingly.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII: That the Bishops suffer none under Noblemen, and Men quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Law, to have or keep any Private Chaplain in his House.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII: That they take special care, that Divine Service be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently frequented, as well for Prayers and Catechism, as Sermons;
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:54614:273"/>
and that particular notice be taken of all such as absent themselves, as Recusants or otherwise.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX: That no Bishop whatsoever, who, by our Grace and good Opinion of his Service, shall be nominated by us to another Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, shall from the Day of that our nomination, presume to make any Lease for Three Lives, or One and Twenty Years, or Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Lease, or any way renew any Estate, or cut any Wood or Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; but meerly receive the Rents due, and quit the Place. For we think it a hateful thing, that any Man's Preferment to a better Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick should almost undoe the Successor. And if any shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to break this Order, we will refuse him at our Royal Assent, and keep him at the Place which he hath so abused.</p>
                     <p n="10">X: That every Bishop give his Metropolitan a strict Account yearly, of their Obedience to our late Letters prohibiting them to change any Leases from Years into Lives; and that they fail not to certifie, if they find that the Dean, or Dean and Chapter, or any Arch-Deacon, or Prebendary, &amp;c. within their several Diocesses, have at any time broken our Commands, in any particular contained in the aforesaid Letters.</p>
                     <p n="11">XI: That every Bishop, to whom, in regard of the small Revenues of his Bishoprick, we either have already, or shall hereafter, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give Power, but Command to receive and hold as in <hi>Commendam</hi> any Lease expired, or near expiring, and belonging to their See, or any Ecclesiastical Benefice, or Benefices, or other Promotion with Cure, or without; being in his, or their own Gift by Letters given under our Signet, and sent to those Bishops respectively, do likewise give an Account yearly to his Metropolitan, that he doth not put any of the aforenamed Benefices, or other Preferment out of his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendam,</hi> to give to any Son, Kinsman, Friend, or other, upon any pretence whatsoever, thereby to frustrate our gracious Intentions to those several Sees, and the Succeeding Bishops therein.</p>
                     <p n="12">XII: That every Bishop respectively do likewise in his yearly Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to his Metropolitan, give notice of any notable Alteration, or other Accident within his Diocess, which may any ways concern ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Doctrine or the Discipline of the Church established.</p>
                     <p n="13">XIII: That whereas <hi>John Bancroft</hi> Dr. in Divinity, and Bishop of <hi>Oxford,</hi> hath very worthily, at his own proper Cost and Charges Built a House for himself, and the Bishops of <hi>Oxford</hi> successively, (by our both leave and encouragement) upon the Vicarage of <hi>Cuddes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> near <hi>Oxford,</hi> which Vicarage is in the Patronage and Gift of him and his Successors. And whereas our farther Will and Pleasure is, that the said House together with the Vicarage aforesaid, shall ever be held in <hi>Commendam</hi> by the Bishops of <hi>Oxford</hi> successively. That therefore the said Bishop for the time being do yearly give his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Account of his holding both the House, and Benefice aforesaid, to the end, that we and our Successors may upon all occasions be put
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:54614:273"/>
in mind of keeping that House and Vicarage to the See of <hi>Oxford,</hi> at all times of change, when or howsoever that Bishoprick shall become void.</p>
                     <p n="14">XIV: Lastly, we Command every Bishop respectively, to give his Account in Writing to his Metropolitan, of all these our Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, or as many of them as may concern him, at, or before the Tenth day of <hi>December</hi> yearly. And likewise, that you out of them make a Brief of your whole Province, and present it to us every Year, by the Second day of <hi>January</hi> following, that so we may see how the Church is Governed, and our Commands Obeyed. And hereof in any wise fail you not.</p>

                     <p>WHereas his Majesty in his late Instructions to the Lords the Bishops, hath amongst other things commanded, that every Bishop respectively, should give an Account in Writing to his Metropolitan, of all those Instructions, or so many of them as may concern him, at, or before the Tenth day of <hi>December</hi> yearly: And likewise, that the Lord Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> his Grace, do make out of them a Brief of his whole Province, and present it to his Sacred Majesty every year, by the second day of <hi>January</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. My Lord Arch-Bishop in Obedience to the said Commands, did present an Account in Writing to his Majesty, how those Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Pious Instructions, for the Good and Welfare of the Church of Christ in this Kingdom, have been obeyed and performed by the several Bishops within his Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for the Year of our Lord God 1634. Which Account by his Grace's Command, is Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred amongst the other Acts of his Province by his principal Register. And that in farther Obedience to the said Instructions, his Grace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered another Brief in Writing, of his said Province, for this present Year of our Lord God, 1635. unto Sir <hi>John Cooke</hi> Knight, one of the Principal Secretaries of State, to be presented to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty by the time aforesaid; but by Reason of his the said Secretary's Sickness, it is mislaid or lost, and so hath not been presented to his Majesty, nor any Observation by the King put upon it; which loss notwithstanding, the Lord Arch-Bishop commanded instead of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistring the Brief it self, that this Memorial of the loss of it should be Registred. <hi>Martij:</hi> 14. 1635.</p>

                        <p>NOtwithstanding this Memorial, the Arch-Bishop's Account for the Year 1635. is very happily come to my Hand after this manner. My very Worthy Friend, Sir <hi>Will. Cooke</hi> of <hi>Broom</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> sent me a Letter dated <hi>Nov:</hi> 6: 1681. that being Executor to an Uncle of his then lately Deceased in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> he found in his Study a Bundle of Original Papers of Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> (which are the Annual Accounts here following, from: 1632. to: 1639.) with a Letter to me in the Words following. <hi>May it please your Grace, &amp;c. vide infra.</hi> The Writer of this Letter Mr: <hi>Thomas Raymond,</hi> a very Ingenious Gentleman, was (as Sir <hi>Will: C:</hi> tells me) bred up under Sir <hi>Will. Boswell</hi> Embassadour in <hi>Holland,</hi> and was after Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the present Earl of <hi>Peterborough</hi> in his Travels: And was after his Return, (as I have heard) one of the Clerks of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's Privy Council, possibly, under Sir <hi>Jo: Cooke</hi> Principal Secretary, by which Means these Papers might come into his Hands. The Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals are all Signed by the Arch-Bishop; that of 1632. by <hi>G. Cant.</hi> being <hi>Abbot's last,</hi> and the rest <hi>W: Cant.</hi> being Arch-Bishop <hi>Lauds;</hi> all which are Apostilled in the Margin with the King's own Hand, except only that of 1635. which it seems by Secretary <hi>Cook's</hi> default, never came to the King's view. I found also, among Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud's</hi> Papers, Duplicates of the Accounts for 1634, 6, 7, 8, and 9. with the King's Notes also Copied in the Margin: And 3 of them, (<hi>scil.</hi> the 3 last) are Registred in <hi>Registr.

                     <p>ACcording to Your Royal Commands, I do here, upon the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>January</hi> 1633. <hi>Comput. Aglic:</hi> present my Accompt of both the Diocess and Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> concerning all those Church Affairs, which are contained within your Majesty's most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Declaration and Instructions; Published out of your most Princely and Religious Care to preserve Unity in Orthodox Doctrine, and Conformity to Government in this your Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And First, for my own Diocess of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> I hear of many things <note place="margin">Canterbury.</note> amiss; but as yet, my time hath been so short, that I have had no certain knowledge of any thing fit to certifie; save only, that some of my Peculiars in <hi>London</hi> are Extreamly out of order.</p>
                     <p>For the Bishoprick of <hi>London,</hi> it is certified, that my Lord the now <note place="margin">London.</note> Bishop hath not received complaint against any of his Clergy, since his coming to that See, which was since <hi>Michaelmas</hi> last. For all the former part of this First Year I must give your Majesty Accompt for my self, being then Bishop there.</p>
                     <p>And First, having heretofore, after long patience and often confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, proceeded against <hi>Nathaniel Ward,</hi> Parson of <hi>Stondon</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> to Excommunication and Deprivation, for refusing to subscribe to the Articles established by the Canon of the Church (of which I certified the last Year) I have now left him still under the Censure of Excommunication.</p>

                        <pb n="526" facs="tcp:54614:275"/>
I did likewise convent Mr: <hi>John Beedle,</hi> Rector of <hi>Barnstone</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> for omitting some parts of Divine Service, and refusing Conformity. But upon his submission and promise of reformation, I dismissed him with a Canonical Admonition only.</p>
                     <p>Since my return out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Mr: <hi>John Davenport,</hi> Vicar of St: <hi>Stephens</hi> in <hi>Coleman-street</hi> (whom I used with all Moderation, and about Two Years since, thought I had setled his Judgment, having him then at advantage enough, to have put extremity upon him, but forbare it) hath now resigned his Vicarage, declared his Judgment against Conformity with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and is since gone (as I hear) to <hi>Amsterdam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For <hi>Bath and Wells,</hi> I find that the Lord Bishop hath in his late Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <note place="margin">Bath and Wells.</note> taken a great deal of pains to see all your Majesty's Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons observed. And particularly hath put down divers Lecturers in Market-Towns, which were Beneficed Men in other Bishops Dioces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Because he found, that when they had Preached Factious and Disorderly Sermons, they retired into other Countries, where his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction would not reach to punish them.</p>
                     <p>His Lordship hath likewise sent up a List of <hi>Romish</hi> Recusants, which were presented at his last Visitation; which, he saith, are for the most part but of mean Condition, and those not many, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the greatness of the County.</p>
                     <p>In this Diocess, the Town of <hi>Mawling,</hi> and that whole Deanery, <note place="margin">Rochester:</note> were very much out of Order; but the Arch-Deacon, by my Lord the Bishop's Command, hath setled them.</p>
                     <p>My Lord likewise brought Mr: <hi>Throgmorton</hi> the Vicar of <hi>Mawling</hi> into the High Commission; where he submitted himself, and received a Canonical Admonition.</p>
                     <p>I likewise certifie your Majesty, that the Bishop complains that the Cathedral Church suffers much for want of Glass in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and that the Church-Yard lies very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decently, and the Gates down; and that he <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C: R:</hi> This must be remedied one way or other; concerning which I expect a particular account of you.</note> hath no Power to remedy these things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Dean and Chapter refuse to be visit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, upon pretence that their Statutes are not confirmed under the Broad Seal; with some other circumstances, with which I shall acquaint your Majesty more at large.</p>
                     <p>Concerning this Diocess, whereas your Majesty's Instructions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <note place="margin">Peterburgh.</note> that Lecturers should turn their Afternoon Sermons into Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing by way of Question and Answer; some Persons and Vicars make a question, whether they be bound to the like Order, because Lecturers only be named, as they pretend: But your Majesty's
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:54614:275"/>
Expression is clear for Catechizing generally, and my Lord the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop will presently settle this doubt.</p>
                     <p>There is one Mr: <hi>Elms</hi> in that Diocess, who being not qualified by Law, keeps a School-Master in his House, and useth him as a Chaplain to preach a Lecture upon <hi>Sundays</hi> in the Afternoon in the Church of <hi>Warmington:</hi> But by this time, if the Bishop keep his promise, that abuse is Rectified.</p>
                     <p>The Bishop complains, that the Peculiars of his Diocess (wherein <note place="margin">Coventry and Lich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.</note> he hath no Power) are much out of Order; and I easily believe it. But the Remedy will be hard; because I know not in whom the Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liars are; but shall inform my self.</p>
                     <p>His Lordship farther certifies, that he hath suppressed a Seditious Lecture at <hi>Repon;</hi> and divers Monthly-Lectures, with a Fast and a Moderator (like that which they called Prophesying in Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth's</hi> Time) as also the Running Lecture, so called, because the Lecturer went from Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C: R:</hi> If there be Dark Corners in this Dioces; it were fitt a true Light should Illuminat it; and not this that is falce and uncertaine.</note> to Village; and at the end of the Week Proclaimed where they should have him next, that his Disciples might follow. They say this Lecture was ordained to Illuminate the Dark Corners of that Diocess.</p>
                     <p>My Lord of St: <hi>Davids</hi> is now Resident in his Diocess, and hath <note place="margin">
                           <hi>St.</hi> Davids.</note> so been ever since the last Spring; and professes, that he will take great care hereafter, to whom he gives holy Orders.</p>
                     <p>His Lordship certifies, That he hath Suspended a Lecturer for his Inconformity; and that they have but few <hi>Romish</hi> Recusants.</p>
                     <p>The Bishop of St: <hi>Asaph</hi> returns, That all is exceeding well in his <note place="margin">
                           <hi>St.</hi> Asaph.</note> Diocess, save only that the Number and Boldness of some <hi>Romish</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusants increaseth much in many Places, and is incouraged by the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious and frequent Concourse of some of that Party to <hi>Holy-Well,</hi> otherwise called St: <hi>Winifreds</hi> Well: Whether this Concourse be by way of Pilgrimage or no, I know not; but I am sure it hath long been complained of, without Remedy.</p>
                     <p>My Lord the Bishop certifies, that he hath not one Refractory Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformist <note place="margin">Landaff.</note> or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>My Lord the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> signifies, That the Company of <note place="margin">Lincoln.</note> 
                        <hi>Mercers</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> trusted with the Gift of one Mr: <hi>Fishburn,</hi> set up a Lecturer in <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> with the allowance of Forty Pounds <hi>per An.</hi> to Preach every <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning (being Market-Day) and <hi>Sunday</hi> in the Afternoon; with a Proviso in his Grant from them, that upon any dislike they may have of him, he shall at a Month, or a Fortnights Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, give over the Place, without any relation to Bishop or Arch-Bishop.</p>

My most humble Suit to your <note place="margin">

                     <p>His Lordship likewise complains of some in <hi>Bedfordshire,</hi> that use to wander from their own Parish-Churches, to follow Preachers Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by themselves, of which he hath caused his Officers to take special care. As for the placing of the Communion-Table in Parish-Churches, his Lordship professes, that he takes care of it, according to the Canon. These two last are no part of your Majesty's Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; yet, since his Lordship hath been so careful to report them to me, I take it my Duty to express that his Lordship's care to your Majesty.</p>

                     <p>I Am at this time, in Obedience to your Sacred Majesty's Commands, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Januar.</hi> 2. 1634.</note> to give you an Account, how your prudent and pious Instructions for the Good and Welfare of the Church of Christ, in this your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, have been obeyed and performed by the several Bishops within my Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> which, with all Humility and Obedience, I here present as followeth:</p>
                     <p>And First I represent to your Majesty, That I have this Year, <note place="margin">Cant.</note> partly by my Vicar-General, and partly by the Dean of the Arches, visited seven Diocesses, beginning (as I am bound by the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Laws) at my own Metropolitical Church of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and that Diocess, that I might first see what was done at Home, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I did curiously look abroad into other Bishops Jurisdictions.</p>
                     <p>And not to conceal Truth from your Majesty, I found in my own Diocess (especially about <hi>Ashford-side</hi>) divers professed Separatists, with whom I shall take the best and most present Order that I can; some of them, and some of <hi>Maidstone</hi> (where much Inconformity hath of late Years spread) being already called into the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, where, if they be proved as guilty as they are voiced to be, I shall not fail to do Justice upon them.</p>
                     <p>I conceive, under favour, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C: R:</hi> Put mee in mynd of this at some convenient tyme, when I am at Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and I shall redress it.</note> Churches in <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Sandwich</hi> are great Nurseries of Inconformity in those Parts. Your Majesty may be pleased to remember, I have complained to your self, and my Lords at the Council-Board, and humbly desired, That they, both of the <hi>French, Italian,</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Congregations, which are born Subjects, may not be suffered any longer to live in such a Separation as they do, from both Church and State. And have, according to that which I thought might best sort with your Majesty's Intentions, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded my Vicar-General, when he was lately at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to begin fairly to call them to Conform with the <hi>English</hi> Church. Which bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness I do hereby humbly beseech your Majesty to look upon with a provident Eye, not here only, but much more in <hi>London,</hi> for the better settling of both Church and Commonwealth in that Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. And for your Majesty's Instructions I have for my own part punctually observed them.</p>
                     <p>The rest of the Diocesses which I visited this Year, are <hi>Rochester, Salisbury, Bristol, Bath and Wells, Exeter</hi> and <hi>Lincoln.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="530" facs="tcp:54614:277"/>
For <hi>Rochester</hi> I found no eminent thing amiss; but the Bishop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <note place="margin">Rochester.</note> fell into a Palsie, and was thereby forced to go to the <hi>Bath,</hi> and so to be longer absent from his Diocess, than otherwise he would have been; and he is now returned, God be thanked, much better; though not perfectly well. And for the Diocess, I did not find in my Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation any noted Breach upon any your Majesty's Instructions.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Salisbury,</hi> I found the Bishop had taken a great deal of Care <note place="margin">Sarum.</note> about your Majesty's said Instructions; and that they might be the better both known and obeyed, he hath caused Copies of them to be sent to most of the Ministers in his Diocess; which hath done a great deal of good.</p>
                     <p>And though it be not amongst your Instructions, yet I am bold to signifie unto your Sacred Majesty, that I find the greatest part of <hi>Wiltshire</hi> overgrown with the Humours of those Men that do not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; and are as backward, both Clergy and Laity, towards the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Church, as any part of <hi>England</hi> that I have observed.</p>
                     <p>The Cathedral at <hi>Salisbury</hi> is much pestered <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> I doe, and will express my Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure (if need be) what way you will.</note> with Seats, and I have given Order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them; which I hope your Majesty will approve, as well as you did at <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Durham;</hi> and add your Power, if mine be not sufficient.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Bristol,</hi> I find in my Visitation that the Bishop there hath taken <note place="margin">Bristol.</note> very good Pains and Care since his coming thither. And that some Clergy-men in <hi>Dorsetshire,</hi> which gave great cause of Suspicion, have quit themselves in a better manner than was expected; though all be not right in those Parts.</p>
                     <p>Concerning <hi>Bath and Wells,</hi> I must needs return to your Majesty, <note place="margin">Bath and Wells.</note> that which I would to God I could do of all the rest, namely, That all your Instructions are punctually observed; and the Lectures (as many as are in that Diocess) read, not by any particular factious Persons, but by a Company of Learned neighbouring Ministers, which are every way conformable to the Church.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Exeter,</hi> where, according to many Complaints that had been <note place="margin">Exon.</note> made here above, I might have expected many things out of Order; I must do my Lord the Bishop this Right, that for your Majesty's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, they have been carefully observ'd. But a great Division there is between the Dean and Chapter. I have twice set them at Peace, yet it breaks out again. And, I doubt, there being so many Brothers and Brothers-in-Law in that Chapter, is not the least Cause of it; the rest siding together for fear of Oppression.</p>
                     <p>I find also there hath been, and is at this present, a great Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Dean and Chapter and the City, about Burial with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church-yard of the Cathedral. I shall do my best to set
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:54614:277"/>
Peace between them, and if I cannot, as I much fear it, I shall be an humble Suitor to your Majesty, to take it into your Princely Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; lest it do more Prejudice to both Bodies, than is yet thought of.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Lincoln,</hi> it being the greatest Diocess in the Kingdom, I have <note place="margin">Lincoln.</note> now reduced that under Metropolitical Visitation also, and visited it this preceding Year. My Visitors there found <hi>Bedfordshire,</hi> for the bigness, most tainted of any part of the Diocess: And in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Mr: <hi>Buckley</hi> is sent to the High-Commission for Inconformity. And in <hi>Leicester</hi> the Dean of the Arches Suspended one Mr: <hi>Angell,</hi> who hath continued a Lecturer in that great Town, for these divers Years, without any License at all to Preach; yet took Liberty enough. I doubt his Violence hath crackt his Brain, and do therefore use him the more tenderly, because I see the Hand of God hath overtaken him.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Lincoln</hi> it self, my Vicar General certifies me, there are many <hi>Anabaptists</hi> in it, and that their Leader is one <hi>Johnson</hi> a Baker; and that in divers parts of that Diocess, many both of Clergy and Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are excessively given to Drunkenness: That the Town of <hi>Boston,</hi> which was a great Nursery of Inconformity, is since the calling of some of the Magistrates into the High-Commission, become very Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, and setled to Obedience. But the Town of <hi>Louth</hi> somewhat to blame.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Kelstern</hi> dwells the wild young Gentleman Mr: <hi>South</hi> (concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom I have lately spoken, and that often <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> The South-West Windis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the best, therefore I will not hinder the blowing that way.</note> with your Majesty) he hath committed a horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Incest, and gotten two Sisters with Child. I have called him into the High-Commission against the next Term, and I hope your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty will give me leave to make <hi>South</hi> blow <hi>West</hi> for St. <hi>Pauls.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At <hi>Kensworth</hi> in <hi>Hertfordshire,</hi> and some other Places, many gadd from their own Churches by Troops, after other Ministers. Which is a common fault in the South Parts of that Diocess, where the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are said to be very giddy in matters of Religion.</p>
                     <p>The Cathedral of this Diocess is not well ordered, either for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration or Ornaments; but the Dean and Chapter, to whom that Care belongs, have promised speedy amendment.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Eaton</hi> College, within that Diocess, I do not find but that the Provost, Sir <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> hath carried himself very worthily. The greatest things thought to be amiss in that Society, are those which are referred to me by your Majesty, upon the Complaint of <hi>Kings Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege</hi> in <hi>Cambridge;</hi> to which I have no more to say, till I see whether they of <hi>Eaton</hi> will decline the Reference or no.</p>
                     <p>Thus far concerning the Diocesses, which I have visited this Year. In all which I find one great Complaint, and very fit to be redressed.
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:54614:278"/>
It is the general grievance of the poor Vicars, that their Stipends are scarce able to Feed and Cloath them. And which is worse, the Vicars in great Market-Towns where the People are very many, are for the most part worst provided for. But I humbly thank your Majesty, some good hath of late been done for them; and I shall pursue all just and fair ways to give them Relief; Humbly beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you to give your gracious Assistance to me and them.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Winchester,</hi> I find my Lord Bishop there, hath been very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <note place="margin">Winton.</note> for all your Majesty's Instructions, and that they are well obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved through that Diocess; save only, that in two Parishes, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop finds some defect about Catechizing in the Afternoon, of which he will take great Care, that it my be remedied. And I find by his Lordship's return to me, that there are divers obstinate Recusants in those parts, which, I presume, are certified to your Majesty's Judges according to Law.</p>
                     <p>The Bishop of <hi>London</hi> visited his Diocess this Year, the City and <note place="margin">London.</note> 
                        <hi>Middlesex</hi> in Person, the rest by his Chancellour, by reason of his necessary attendance upon your Majesty. In this his Visitation, he found divers complaints about Inconformity to the Church Discipline; but the Proofs came home only against Four, Three Curates, and a Vicar. The Vicar upon Submission, hath time given him till the next Term, to settle himself and reduce his Parishioners. And two of the Three Curates did presently submit themselves, and promise constancy in their Obedience to the Church. The Third Curate one <hi>Philip Saunders</hi> of <hi>Hutton</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> being Refractory was Suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and hath since forsaken the Diocess. It seems he means to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle himself, where he may hope to find more Favour.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Norwich,</hi> the Bishop certifies, that he hath put down some <note place="margin">Norwich.</note> Lectures, where Factious Men performed them, and particularly, that he hath Suspended one <hi>Bridges</hi> Curate of St: <hi>Georges</hi> Parish in <hi>Norwich,</hi> for transgressing your Majesty's Declaration in his Lectures; but hath of late freed him from that Suspension, upon humble sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission made, and promise not to offend hereafter. And farther, that he hath lately heard complaint of Mr: <hi>Ward</hi> of <hi>Ipswich</hi> for some Words uttered in Sermons of his, for which he is now called into the High-Commission.</p>
                     <p>He farther Certifies, that he hath Suspended one <hi>Enoch Grey</hi> for unsound Doctrine Preached by him. And that one <hi>Simon Jacob, alias Bradshaw,</hi> and <hi>Ralph Smith</hi> two Wanderers, went up and down Preaching here and there, without Place of Aboad or Authority: And that upon his Summoning them to appear, they are run out of that Diocess. Your Majesty's Instructions in other things, have (as he certifieth) been carefully observed both by himself and his Clergy.</p>
                     <p>The Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> certifies, that for any thing that hath been <note place="margin">Ely.</note> made appear to him, all your Majesty's Royal Injunctions for the
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:54614:278"/>
good of the Church have been carefully observed throughout his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocess. And he promises to carry a watchful Eye, as he hath ever done, concerning all such Lecturers, as are, or shall at any time be in his Diocess.</p>
                     <p>For St. <hi>Davids,</hi> the Bishop is now gone and setled in his Diocess, <note place="margin">St. <hi>Davids.</hi>
                        </note> whence he hath not been absent two Months these two Years. He promiseth to be very careful whom he Ordains. The Lecturers in those parts are not many; yet of late, he hath been driven first to Suspend, and afterwards to dismiss one <hi>Roberts</hi> a Welch Lecturer for Inconformity. And one or two others, that have with their giddiness offered to distemper the People, he hath likewise driven out of his Diocess. But his Lordship complains grievously (and not without Cause) that divers Impropriators, in those parts, have either pulled down the Chancels, or suffered them to fall, to the great debasing of their Churches, and leaving them so open and cold, as that the People in those mountainous parts must endure a great deal of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as well in the Churches, as in their way to them.</p>
                     <p>The Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> professes he hath little to return. And <note place="margin">St. <hi>Asaph.</hi>
                        </note> that it is a great part of his Comfort, in that remote place, that the whole Diocess in a manner is peaceable and obedient, as well to your Majesty's Instructions, as other things which concern the Church. That they are not any where troubled with Inconformity: But heartily wishes, that they might be as well acquitted from Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition and Prophaneness.</p>
                     <p>The Bishop of <hi>Landaff</hi> certifies, That this last Year he Visited in <note place="margin">Landaff.</note> Person; and found that <hi>William Erbury,</hi> Vicar of St. <hi>Maries</hi> in <hi>Cardiff,</hi> and <hi>Walter Cradocke</hi> his Curate, have been very disobedient to your Majesty's Instructions, and have Preached very Schismatically and Dangerously to the People. That for this he hath given the Vicar a Judicial Admonition, and will further proceed, if he do not submit. And for his Curate, being a bold ignorant young Fellow, he hath Suspended him, and <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C.

Among other things he used this base and Unchristian passage in the Pulpit, That God so loved the <hi>world, that for it he sent his Son to live like a Slave, and dye like a Beast.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He farther Certifies, that one <hi>William Newport,</hi> Rector of <hi>Langua</hi> in <hi>Monmouthshire,</hi> hath pulled down the Partition betwixt the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel and the Church, and sold part, and disposed the rest to his own use, with some other violences, to the great prophanation of that place: For which the Bishop desires leave to bring him into the High Commission.</p>
                     <p>The Bishop of <hi>Glocester</hi> Certifies, That he is forced to Ordain <note place="margin">Glocester.</note> some very mean Ministers in his Diocess, to supply Cures as mean; yet he professeth, that to his knowledge, he never gave Holy Orders
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:54614:279"/>
to any unworthy Person. And further he saith, that he hath put down some Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C.

Which, if it be true, is a great clearing of those parts, which have of late been so much suspected.</p>
                     <p>This Bishoprick is void. <note place="margin">Hereford.</note>

                     <p>For the Diocess of <hi>Oxford,</hi> I find the Bishop very careful, and <note place="margin">Oxford.</note> that he hath according to his Promise made to your Majesty, built a House at <hi>Cuddesden,</hi> a Vicarage in his own Diocess and Gift, which he now holds in <hi>Commendam.</hi> Which House he humbly desires, by your Majesty's Favour, may be annexed to the See of <hi>Oxford,</hi> which never yet had any House belonging to it. And for your Instructions, they have all been observed within his Diocess, save that he doubts some few Lecturers, of whom he will make present Inquiry, and hath already suppressed Two, which were not performed as they ought, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Dadington</hi> and <hi>Woodstocke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My Lord of <hi>Chichester</hi> Certifies all very well in his Diocess; save <note place="margin">Chichester.</note> only in the East part, which is far from him, he finds that some Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan Justices of the Peace, have awed some of the Clergy into like Opinions with themselves, which yet of late have not broken out into any publick Inconformity.</p>
                     <p>The Bishop of <hi>Peterborough</hi> hath Visited his Diocess this last year, <note place="margin">Peterborough</note> and begun so well to look to all good Orders, that I hope things will go very well there. But I find he is beholding to his Predecessors, who took very good care in former Years concerning your Majesties Instructions.</p>
                     <p>This is all the Return which I have this year to make to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, having received no Accompt at all from these Bishops follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz. Worcester, Coventry</hi> and <hi>Lichfield,</hi> and <hi>Bangor.</hi>

                     </head>
                     <p>ACcording to your Royal Commands, I do here, upon the Second of <hi>Januay</hi> 1635. <hi>Comput: Angl.</hi> present my Account both for the Diocess and Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> concerning all those Church-Affairs, which are contained in your Majesty's most gracious Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, published out of your most Princely and Religious care to preserve Unity in Orthodox Doctrine, and Conformity to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment within this your Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And First, for my own Diocess; I humbly represent to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, <note place="margin">Canterbury.</note> that there are yet very many Refractory Persons to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church of <hi>England</hi> about <hi>Maidstone</hi> and <hi>Ashford,</hi> and some other Parts; the Infection being spread by one <hi>Brewer,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and increased by one <hi>Turner.</hi> They have been both Censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the High-Commission Court some Years since; but the Hurt which they have done, is so deeply rooted, as that it is not possible to be plucked up on the suddain; but I must crave time to work it off by little and little.</p>
                     <p>I have, according to your Majesty's Commands, required Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to my Injunctions sent to the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches at <hi>Canterbury, Maidstone</hi> and <hi>Sandwich.</hi> And albeit they made some shew of Conformity; yet I do not find they have yielded such Obedience as is required, and was ordered with your Majesty's Consent and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. So that I fear, I shall be driven to a quicker proceeding with them.</p>
                     <p>The Cathedral Church begins to be in very good Order. And I have almost finished their Statutes; which being once perfected, will <hi>(mutatis mutandis)</hi> be a sufficient Direction for the making of the Statutes for the other Cathedrals of the new Erection, which in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's Time, had either none left, or none Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed; and those which are, in many things not Canonical. All which Statutes, your Majesty hath given Power to me with others, under the Broad Seal of <hi>England,</hi> to alter, or make new, as we shall find Cause. And so soon as these Statutes for the Church of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> are made ready, I shall humbly submit them to your Majesty for Confirmation.</p>
                     <p>There is one Mr: <hi>Walker,</hi> of St: <hi>John's the Evangelist,</hi> a Peculiar of mine in <hi>London,</hi> who hath all his time been but a disorderly and a peevish Man; and now of late hath very frowardly Preached against the Lord Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> his Book concerning the Lord's Day, set out by Authority. But upon a Canonical Admonition given him to desist, he hath hitherto recollected himself, and I hope will be advised.</p>

                        <pb n="536" facs="tcp:54614:280"/>
For the Diocess of <hi>London,</hi> I find my Lord the Bishop hath been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">London.</note> careful for all that concerns his own Person. But Three of his Arch-Deacons have made no return at all to him; so that he can certifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what hath come to his knowledge without their help.</p>
                     <p>There have been convented in this Diocess Dr: <hi>Stoughton</hi> of <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manbury,</hi> Mr: <hi>Simpson</hi> Curate and Lecturer of St: <hi>Margarets- New-Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street,</hi> Mr: <hi>Andrew Moline</hi> Curate and Lecturer of St: <hi>Swithin,</hi> Mr: <hi>John Goodwin</hi> Vicar of St: <hi>Stevens Colman-street,</hi> and Mr: <hi>Viner</hi> Lecturer of St: <hi>Laurence</hi> in the Old <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, for Breach of the Canons of the Church in Sermons, or Practice, or both. But because all them promised Amendment for the future, and submission to the Church in all things; my Lord very moderately forbore farther proceeding against them.</p>
                     <p>There were likewise convented Mr: <hi>Sparrowhawke</hi> Curate and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturer at St: <hi>Mary Woolchurch,</hi> for Preaching against the Canon for Bowing at the Name of <hi>Jesus;</hi> who, because he wilfully persisted, is suspended from Preaching in that Diocess. As also one Mr: <hi>John Wood,</hi> a wild turbulent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and formerly Censured in the High-Commission-Court. But his Lordship forbore Mr: <hi>White</hi> of <hi>Knightsbridge,</hi> for that his Cause is at this present depending in the Court aforesaid.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Diocess of <hi>Lincoln</hi> my Lord the Bishop returns <note place="margin">Lincoln.</note> this Information. That he hath Visited the same this Year all over in Person, which he conceives no Predecessor of his hath done these Hundred Years: And that he finds so much good done thereby, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that which Chancellours use to do when they go the Visitation; that he is sorry he hath not done it heretofore, in so many Years as he hath been Bishop.</p>
                     <p>He farther Certifies, that he hath prevailed beyond Expectation for the Augmenting of Four or Five small Vicarages; and conceives (as your Majesty may be pleased to remember I have often told you upon my own Experience) that it is a Work very necessary and fit to be done, and most worthy of your Majesty's Royal Care and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.</p>
                     <p>For Conformity, his Lordship professeth that in that large Diocess he knows but one unconformable Man, and that is one <hi>Lindhall,</hi> who is in the High-Commission Court, and ready for Sentence.</p>
                     <p>My Lord the Bishop of <hi>Bath and Wells</hi> Certifies, that his Diocess is <note place="margin">Bath and Wells.</note> in very good Order and Obedience. That there is not a single Lecture in any Town Corporate, but grave Divines Preach by course; and that he hath changed the Afternoon Sermons into Catechising by Question and Answer, in all Parishes.</p>
                     <p>His Lordship farther Certifies, that no Man hath been Presented unto him since his last <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="537" facs="tcp:54614:280"/>
Church, or Your Majesty's Instructions; and that he hath received no notice of any increase of Men Popishly affected, beyond the number mentioned in his last Certificat.</p>
                     <p>The Bishop of this See died almost Half a Year since; and had <note place="margin">Norwich.</note> sent in no Certificat. But I find by my Visitation there this present Year, that the whole Diocess is much out of Order, and more at <hi>Ips<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> and <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> than at <hi>Norwich</hi> it self: But I hope my Lord, that now is will take care of it; and he shall want no Assistance, that I can give him.</p>
                     <p>Mr: <hi>Samuel Ward,</hi> Preacher at <hi>Ipswich,</hi> was Censured this last Term in the High-Commission Court, for Preaching in Disgrace of the Common-Prayer-Book and other like gross Misdemeanours.</p>
                     <p>These Six Bishops respectively make their Answer, that in their <note place="margin">Oxon. Sarum. Ely. Chichester. St. Asaph. Bristol.</note> own Persons they have observed all your Majesty's Instructions; and that they find all their Clergy very conformable, no one of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancing in any particular to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>In this Diocess, the Bishop found, in his Triennial Visitation the <note place="margin">Landaff.</note> former Year, two noted Schismaticks, <hi>Wroth</hi> and <hi>Erbury;</hi> that led away many simple People after them. And finding, that they will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully persisted in their Schismatical course, he hath carefully prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Articles against them in the High-Commission Court; where, when the Cause is ready for Hearing, they shall receive according to the Merits of it.</p>
                     <p>Concerning this Diocess, your Majesty knows, that the late Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's <note place="margin">Hereford.</note> Residence upon the place was necessarily hindred by his Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon your Majesty's Person, as Clerk of the Closet. But he hath been very careful for the observance of all your Instructions; and particularly for Catechizing of the Youth: As also for not letting of any thing into Lives, to the Prejudice of his Successor; in which he hath done exceeding well: And I have by your Majesty's Command laid a strict Charge upon his Successor, to look to those Particular Leases which he hath made stay of, that they may be reduced into Years, for the good of that See, which abundantly needs it.</p>
                     <p>My Lord Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> Certifies, that there is all Peace and <note place="margin">Winton.</note> Order in his Diocess; and that himself and his Clergy have duly Obeyed your Majesty's Instructions. But he Informs, that in the Parish of <hi>Avington</hi> in <hi>Hampshire,</hi> one <hi>Vnguyon</hi> an Esquire, is Presented for a new Recusant; as also Three others, whereof Two are in <hi>Southwark.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These Three Bishops, for their several Diocesses, respectively make <note place="margin">Peterburgh Rochester. Exeter.</note> return, that all Obedience is yielded to every of your Majesty's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions.</p>
                     <p>The late Bishop of St: <hi>Davids</hi> (now of <hi>Hereford</hi>) hath in his time <note place="margin">St: Davids.</note>
                        <pb n="538" facs="tcp:54614:281"/>
of Residence, taken a great deal of pains in that See, and hath caused Two to be questioned in the High Commission, and Suspended one <hi>Roberts,</hi> a Lecturer, for Inconformity. Three or four others which were Suspended, he hath released, upon hope given of their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Church, and hath absolutely deprived Two for their exceeding Scandalous Life. He complains much, and surely with cause enough, that there are few Ministers in those poor and remote places, that are able to Preach and Instruct the People.</p>
                     <p>My Lord the Bishop informs, that that County is very full of <note place="margin">Glocester.</note> Impropriations, which makes the Ministers poor; and their Poverty makes them fall upon Popular and Factious courses. I doubt this is too true, but it is a Mischief hard to cure in this Kingdom; yet I have taken all the care I can, and shall continue so to do.</p>
                     <p>From the rest of the Bishops of my Province, I have received no Certificat this Year, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p>And First, for my own Diocess, I have every Year acquainted <note place="margin">Canterbury.</note> your Majesty, and so must do now, that there are still about <hi>Ashford</hi> and <hi>Egerton,</hi> divers <hi>Brownists</hi> and other Separatists. But they are so very mean and poor People, that we know not what to do with them. They are said to be the Disciples of one <hi>Turner</hi> and <hi>Fennar,</hi> who were long since apprehended, and imprisoned by Order of your Majesty's High Commission Court. But how this part came to be so infected with such a Humour of Separation, I know not, unless
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:54614:281"/>
it were by too much connivence at their first beginning. Neither do I see any Remedy like <note place="margin">

                     <p>I have received Information from my Officers, that the <hi>Walloons</hi> and other Strangers in my Diocess, especially at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> do come orderly to their Parish Churches, and there receive the Sacraments, and Marry, &amp;c. according to my Injunctions, with that limitation which your Majesty allowed.</p>
                     <p>There have been heretofore many in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that were not conformable to Church Discipline, and would not kneel at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; but they are all now very Conformable, as I hear expresly by my Officers; and that there is no falling away of any to Recusancy.</p>
                     <p>There hath been a Custom, that some Ministers thereabouts, have under divers pretences lived for the most part at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and gone seldom to their Benefices; which hath given a double Scandal, both by their absence from their several Cures, and by keeping too much Company, and that not in the best manner. I have seen this remedied in all, save only one Man; and if he do not presently Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, I have taken order for his Suspension.</p>
                     <p>In the Diocess of <hi>London,</hi> I find that my Lord the Bishop there <note place="margin">London.</note> (now by your Majesty's Grace and Favour Lord High Treasurer of <hi>England</hi>) hath very carefully observed those Instructions which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to his own Person. And for the Diocess, his Lordship Informs me of three great Misdemeanours. The one committed by Dr: <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Burges,</hi> who in a <hi>Latin</hi> Sermon before the Clergy of <hi>London,</hi> uttered divers insolent passages against the Bishops and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, and refused to give his Lordship a Copy of the Sermon; so there was a necessity of calling him into the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission Court; which is done.</p>
                     <p>The second Misdemeanour, is of one Mr: <hi>Wharton,</hi> a Minister in <hi>Essex,</hi> who in a Sermon at <hi>Chelmesford,</hi> uttered many unfit, and some scurrilous things. But for this he hath been Convented, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Canonical Admonition. And upon his sorrow and submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, any farther Censure is forborn.</p>
                     <p>The third Misdemeanour which my Lord complains of, is, the late spreading and dispersing of some Factious and Malicious Pamphlets against the Bishops and Government of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And my Lord farther Certifies, that he hath reasonable ground to perswade him, that those Libellous Pamphlets have been Contrived or Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and dispersed by some of the Clergy of his Diocess; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore desires me to use the Authority of the High Commission, for the
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:54614:282"/>
further discovery of this Notorious practice, to prevent the Mischiefs which will otherwise ensue upon the Government of the Church. This, God willing, I shall see performed. But if the High Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall not have Power enough, because one of those Libels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Seditious Matter in it, and that which is very little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>My Visitation is yet depending for this Diocess; and by reason of the Sickness, I could not with safety hold it, nor think it fit to gather so much People together; but, God willing, I shall perform that Duty, so soon as conveniently I may, and then Certifie your Majesty at the next return, what shall come under mine own view.</p>
                     <p>In this Diocess I find by my Lord's Report from his Officers, that <note place="margin">Winchester.</note> there are divers Recusants in several parts of the Country, and that some of them have been seduced away from the Church of <hi>England</hi> within these two or three Years.</p>
                     <p>For all things else I receive no complaint thence, save only of three or four Ministers that are negligent in Catechising, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it not at all, or but in the Lent only. But I shall call upon the Bishop to see this remedied, and to be as vigilant as he can against any farther increase of Recusants.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Bath and Wells</hi> I have received a very good and happy Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficat, <note place="margin">Bath and Wells.</note> both that all your Majesty's Instructions have been exactly performed throughout that whole Diocess. And that by God's Blessing, and the well Ordering of Church Affairs, there have been fewer Popish Recusants presented than formerly, and that the number of them is much decreased. And this I cannot but highly approve to your Majesty, if there be not fewer presented, either by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awing of them which should present, or some Cunning in those which would not be presented.</p>
                     <p>For this Diocess, my Lord hath given me in a very careful and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual <note place="margin">Norwich.</note> Account, very large, and in all Particulars very considerable; And I shall return it to your Majesty as briefly as I can reduce it. And first, he hath for this Summer, but by your Majesty's leave, lived (from both his Episcopal Houses) in <hi>Ipswich,</hi> partly because he was informed, that that side of his Diocess did most need his presence, and he found it so: And partly, because his Chappel at his House in <hi>Norwich,</hi> was possessed by the <hi>French</hi> Congregation, and so the Bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oprick left destitute. But he hath given them warning to provide themselves elsewhere by <hi>Easter</hi> next.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="541" facs="tcp:54614:282"/>
His Lordship found a general defect of Catechising quite through the Diocess; but hath setled it. And in <hi>Norwich,</hi> where there are 34 Churches, there was no Sermon on the Sunday Morning, save only in four; but all put off to the Afternoon; and so no Catechising. But now he hath ordered that there shall be a Sermon every Morning, and Catechising in the Afternoon in every Church.</p>
                     <p>For Lectures, they abounded in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and many set up by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Gentlemen, even without so much as the knowledge of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and without any due observation to the Canons, or the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church. Divers of these his Lordship hath carefully regulated according to Order, and especially in St. <hi>Edmonds-bury,</hi> and with their very good content, and Suspended no Lecturer, of whom he might obtain Conformity. And at <hi>Ipswich</hi> it was not unknown unto them, that now Mr: <hi>Ward</hi> stands Censured in the High Commission, and obeys not: Yet the Bishop was ready to have allowed them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if they would have sought him; but they resolve to have Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> or none, and that (as is conceived) in despight of the Censure of the Court.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> where there was great division heretofore for many Years, their Lecturer being Censured in the High Commission, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two Years since, went into <hi>New-England,</hi> since which time there hath been no Lecture, and very much peace in the Town, and all <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> Let him goe: Wee are well ridd of him.</note> Ecclesiastical Orders well observed. But in <hi>Norwich,</hi> one Mr: <hi>Bridge,</hi> rather than he would Conform, hath left his Lecture and two Cures, and is gone into <hi>Holland.</hi> The Lecturers in the Country, generally observing no Church Orders at all. And yet the Bishop hath carried it with that Temper, and upon their promise, and his hopes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, that he hath Inhibited but three in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and as many in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> of which one is no Graduate, and hath been a common Stage-player.</p>
                     <p>His Lordship craves direction what he shall do with such Scholars (some in Holy Orders, and some not) as Knights and private Gentlemen keep in their Houses, under pretence to Teach their Children. As also with some Divines that are Beneficed in Towns or near, but live in Gentlemens Houses. For my part, I think it very fit the Beneficed Men were punctually commanded, to reside upon their Cures. And for the rest, your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> I approve your Judgment in this. I only add, that care must be taken, that even those Qualified by Law, keepe none but Conformable Men.</note> Instructions, allow none to keep Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, but such as are qualified by Law. All which notwithstanding, I most humbly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit (as the Bishop doth) to your Majesty's Judgment.</p>
                     <p>For Recusants, whereas formerly there were wont to be but two or three Presented, his Lordship hath caused above forty to be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted in <hi>Norwich,</hi> at the last Sessions; and at the Assizes in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> he delivered a List of such as were Presented upon the Oath of the
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:54614:283"/>
Churchwardens, to the Lord Chief Justice, and his Lordship to the Grand Jury: But they <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> Bishops Certificates in this Case, must be most unquestionable Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> slighted it, pretending the Bishop's Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat to be no Evidence. But the true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is conceived to be, because he had also inserted such as had been Presented to him for Recusant Separatists, as well as Recusant Romanists.</p>
                     <p>His Lordships Care hath been such, as that though there are about One Thousand Five Hundred Clergy-Men in that Diocess, and many Disorders; yet there are not Thirty Excommunicated or Suspended; whereof some are for Contumacy, and will not yet submit; some for obstinate denyal to Publish your Majesty's Declaration; and some for contemning all the Orders and Rites of the Church, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding themselves, without License from the Ordinary, for many Years together.</p>
                     <p>Last of all, he found, that one half of the Churches in his Diocess had not a Clerk able to Read and Answer the Minister in Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, by which means the People were wholly disused from joyning with the Priest, and in many places, from so much as saying <hi>Amen.</hi> But concerning this his Lordship hath strictly enjoyned a Reformation.</p>
                     <p>If this Account, given by my Lord of <hi>Norwich,</hi> be true, as I believe it is (and ought to believe it, till it can be disproved) he hath deserved very well of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and hath been very ill rewarded for it. His humble <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> His Sute is granted, and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly his negative Consequence shall followe.</note> Suit to your Majesty is, That you will be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously pleased in your own good time to hear the Complaints that have been made against him, [that he may not be overborn by an Outcry, for doing Service.</p>
                     <p>In the Diocess of <hi>Oxon</hi> I find all your Majesty's Instructions care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <note place="margin">Oxford.</note> obeyed; and there is but one Lecture in the whole Diocess, and that is read at <hi>Henly</hi> upon <hi>Thames,</hi> by some Ministers of the Diocess, conformable Men, and allowed by the Bishop.</p>
                     <p>His Lordship hath also called upon divers <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> If this be not, upon Composition, I understand itt not.</note> Recusants; but upon their being questioned, they plead an Exemption from his Authority under your Majesty's Great Seal.</p>
                     <p>From my Lord of <hi>Ely,</hi> I have received a very fair Account, that <note place="margin">Ely.</note> his Diocess is very orderly and obedient; insomuch, that he hath not any thing of Note to acquaint me with.</p>
                     <p>My Lord in his Certificat mentions two Particulars fit for your <note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> Majesty's Knowledge: The First is, that one of His Clergy in <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordshire,</hi> a Learned and Pious Man (as he saith) set up a Stone upon
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:54614:283"/>
Pillars of Brick, for his Communion-Table, believing it to have been the Altar-Stone. <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> This may prove a bold Part in the Bishop, and the poore Preist in noe Fault; as the other Day his information proved concerning the Ship Business at the Council-Board: therefore examine this farther.</note> And because this appeared to be but a Grave-Stone, and for avoiding of farther Rumours in that Country, among the preciser sort his Lordship caused it to be quietly removed, and the ancient Communion-Table placed in the room of it: But did not farther question the Party, because they found him a harmless Man, and otherwise a Deserver. But how deserving soever he be, I must judge it a very bold part in him to attempt this without the Knowledge and Approbation of his Ordinary.</p>
                     <p>The Second is, that there are risen some Differences in the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern parts of his Diocess, about the Ministers urging the People to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive at the Rails, which his Lordship, saith he, hath procured to be placed about the Holy Table, and the People in some places refusing so to do. Now because this is not Regulated by any Canon of the Church, his Lordship is an humble Suitor that he may have Direction <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> Try your way for some tyme.</note> herein. And truly, I think for this Particular, the People will best be won by the Decency of the Thing it self; and that I suppose may be compassed in a short time. But if your Majesty shall think it fit, that a quicker way be held, I shall humbly submit.</p>
                     <p>From the Lord Bishop of this Diocess I have received no Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; <note place="margin">Sarum.</note> but in General thus: That all your Majesty's Instructions are now observed there, without repugnance, for ought either Chancellor, or any other Officer of his hath informed him.</p>
                     <p>My Lord the Bishop of this See certifies, That your Majesty's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions <note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </note> are carefully observed; and that there are only two Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in the City of <hi>Worcester;</hi> both very conformable, and that they shall not longer continue than they are so. And that the one of them preaches on <hi>Sundays</hi> in the Afternoons, after Chatechizing and Service in the Parish-Churches, and ending before Evening Prayers in the Cathedral.</p>
                     <p>I may not here forbear to acquaint your Majesty, that this <hi>Sunday</hi> Lecture was ever wont to be in the Cathedral, and that it is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, because the City would suffer no Prebendary to have it. And Evening Prayers in their Parish-Churches must needs begin betimes, and their Catechizing be short; and the Prayers at the Cathedral be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin very late, if this Lecture can begin and end in the space between. But if it can be so fitted, I think the Dean and Chapter will not complain of the remove of the Lecture to a Parish-Church.</p>
                     <p>For these Three Diocesses my Lords the Bishops Certifie that all <note place="margin">Exon. Chichester. Peterborough.</note> your Majesty's Instructions are carefully observed; neither do any of them mention any thing amiss in the general, either for Doctrine or Discipline. Only the Bishop of <hi>Exeter</hi> hath sent me up two Copies
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:54614:284"/>
of the late Libel, Intituled, <hi>News from Ipswich,</hi> which were sent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a Stationer with Blank Covers.</p>
                     <p>These Five Diocesses following I have Visited this Year, by my <note place="margin">Hereford.</note> Vicar General and other Commissioners. And for <hi>Hereford,</hi> I find not many things amiss; though the often change of the Bishop there which hath of late hapned, hath done no good among them. But <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> Which ye shall not want if you need.</note> some pretensions there are to certain Customs, which, I conceive, were better broke than kept: And I shall do my best to reform them, as I have Opportunity; and humbly beg your Majesty's Assistance, if I want Power.</p>
                     <p>For St. <hi>Davids,</hi> the Bishop is now there, and will take the best <note place="margin">
                           <hi>St.</hi> Davids.</note> care he can, to see all things in Order. But there is one <hi>Matthews</hi> the Vicar of <hi>Penmayn,</hi> that preaches against the keeping of all Holy-Days, with divers other as Fond, or Prophane Opinions. The Bishop hath inhibited him, and if that do not serve, I shall call him into the High-Commission Court.</p>
                     <p>Baronet <hi>Rudde</hi> is in this Diocess, the Son of a late Bishop there, who is a sober Gentleman, He hath Built him a Chappel, and desires the Bishop to Consecrate it. But his Lordship finding one of your Majesty's Instructions to be, that none should keep a Chaplain in his House, but such as are qualified by Law, which he conceives a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet is not, hath hitherto forborn to Consecrate this Chappel, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be of small use without a Chaplain; and humbly craves dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction herein what he shall do. I humbly propose to your Majesty, whether, considering <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> Since he hath beene at the Charge and hath so good Testimonie, lett him have his desire, with those restricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons mentioned.</note> the Charge this Gentleman hath been at, and the ill Ways which many of them there have to Church, it may not be fit to Consecrate this Chappel, and then that he may have a License to use the Minister of the Parish, or any other lawfully in Orders. Always provided, that he use this Chappel but at times of some necessity, not making himself or his Family strangers to the Mother-Church; and that there be a Clause expressed in the License for recalling thereof, upon any Abuse there committed; and that this License be taken, either from the Bishop un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Seal, or from the Arch-Bishop of the Province.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Landaff,</hi> there is very little found amiss: Only the Bishop <note place="margin">Landaff.</note> complains, that whereas Mr. <hi>Wroth</hi> and Mr. <hi>Erbury</hi> are in the High-Commission for their Schismatical proceedings; the slow prosecution there against them, makes both them persist in their By-ways, and their Followers judge them Faultless. But for this, I humbly present to your Majesty this Answer, That now the loss of two Terms by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Sickness, hath cast the Proceedings of that Court, as well as of others, behind-hand: And there is no Remedy, where all things else stay as well as it.</p>
                     <p>In the Diocess of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> there is no Complaint, but the usual, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>St.</hi> Asaph.</note>
                        <pb n="545" facs="tcp:54614:284"/>
That there is great resort of Recusants to <hi>Holy-Well;</hi> and that this Summer the Lady <hi>Falkland</hi> and her Company, came as Pilgrims thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; who were the more observed, because they travelled on Foot, and Dissembled neither their Quality, nor their Errand. And this Boldness of theirs is of very ill construction among your Majesty's People. My humble Suit to your Majesty is, That whereas I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of this in open Council in your Majesty's presence, you would <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> Itt is done.</note> now be graciously pleased, that the Order then resolved on for her Confinement, may be put in execution.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Bangor,</hi> I find that Catechising was quite out of use in those <note place="margin">Bangor.</note> remote parts (the more the Pity): But the Bishop is now in hope to do much good, and sees some Reformation in that particular already. And I would say for this, and the other Diocesses in <hi>Wales,</hi> that much more good might be done there in a Church-way, if they were not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born by the Proceedings of the Court of the Marches there. And this present Year in this Diocess of <hi>Bangor</hi> my Commissioners for my Metropolitical Visitation there complain unto me, that the Power which belongs to my place, hath been in them very much wronged and impeached by that <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> I doubt not, but by the Grace of God to agree these Differences by my hearinge of them.</note> Court: And I do most humbly beseech your Majesty in your own good time, to give this my Cause a Hearing, if it take not a fair end without that trouble.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Rochester,</hi> the Bishop (God comfort him) is very ill of a Palsy, <note place="margin">Rochester, Glocester, Bristol.</note> and that I fear hath made him forget his Account. Neither hath the Bishop of <hi>Glocester</hi> sent me any; but why I know not. And for <hi>Bristol,</hi> that See is void.</p>
                     <p>For this Diocess, I have likewise received no Account. But I fear, <note place="margin">Coventry and Lichfield.</note> that whereas the Bishop was lately complained of to your Majesty for making Waste of the poor Woods there remaining; he is not over-willing to give an Accotnt of that Particular. Nor of the gross Abuse committed in the Cathedral Church by the Lady <hi>Davis,</hi> who, I most humbly beseech your Majesty, may be so restrained, as that she may have no more Power to commit such horrible Profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
                     <p>And so I most humbly submit this my Yearly Account of my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to your Majesty's Princely Wisdom.</p>

                     <p>ACcording to your Commands, in your Instructions Published for the good of the Clergy, and my bounden Duty, I here present my Annual Account for the Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for the Year last past, 1637.</p>
                     <p>And First, to begin with mine own Diocess, I must give your <note place="margin">Cant.</note> Majesty to understand, that at and about <hi>Ashford</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratists continue to hold their Conventicles, notwithstanding the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of so many of them as have been discovered. They are all of the poorer sort, and very simple, so that I am utterly to seek what to do with them. Two or three of their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> Keepe those particular Persons fast, untill ye thincke what to doe with the rest.</note> Ringleaders, <hi>Brewer, Fenner</hi> and <hi>Turner,</hi> have long been in Prison, and it was once thought fit to proceed against them by the Statute for Abjuration: But I do much doubt, they are so ignorantly wilful, that they will return into the Kingdom, and do a great deal more hurt before they will again be taken. And not long since <hi>Brewer</hi> slipt out of Prison, and went to <hi>Rochester</hi> and other parts of <hi>Kent,</hi> and held Conventicles, and put a great many simple People, especially Women, into great Distempers against the Church. He is taken again, and was called before the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, where he stood silent, but in such a jeering scornful manner, as I scarce ever saw the like. So in Prison he remains.</p>
                     <p>In the Churchyard of the same Town a Butcher's Slaughter-House opened, to the great Annoyance of that place; which I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded should be remedied, and the Door shut up.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Biddenden</hi> I have Suspended <hi>Richard Warren</hi> the School-Master, for refusing the Oath of Allegiance, of Canonical Obedience, and to Subscribe to the Articles. Besides, this precise Man will read no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Divinity to his Scholars: No, not so much as the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar Rules; unless <hi>Mars, Bacchus, Apollo,</hi> and <hi>Pol, AEdepol,</hi> may be blotted out.</p>
                     <p>The Strangers in <hi>Canterbury</hi> do not so much resort to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish-Churches, as formerly they did, at my first giving of my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions. But Visiting this Year, I have given a publick and strict
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:54614:285"/>
Charge that the Delinquents be presented and punished, if they do not their Duty in that behalf.</p>
                     <p>There is one dwelling in <hi>Addisham,</hi> a Married Man, called by the Name of <hi>Thomas Jordan:</hi> He was formerly called <hi>Thomas Mounton,</hi> because he was found in the Church Porch of <hi>Mounton</hi> in Swadling Clothes, left there in all likelyhood by his Mother, who was some Beggar or Strumpet. It is believed, he was never Christned: I have therefore given Order that he shall be Christned, with that Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is prescribed in the Book of Common Prayer, where the Baptism is doubtful.</p>
                     <p>About <hi>Sittingborn</hi> there are more Recusants than in any other part of my Diocess. And the Lady <hi>Roper</hi> Dowager is thought to be a great means of the increase of them. But I have given strict charge that they be carefully presented according to Law.</p>
                     <p>There is still a remainder of Schismaticks in <hi>Egerton,</hi> and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes adjacent. But they are as mean People as those about <hi>Ashford,</hi> and I am as much to seek what to do with them.</p>
                     <p>My Lord Treasurer complains, that he hath little assistance of <note place="margin">London.</note> his Archdeacons; and I believe it to be true, and shall therefore if <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> Itt is most fitt.</note> your Majesty think fit, cause Letters to be written to them, to awake them to their Duties.</p>
                     <p>His Lordship likewise complains of some inconformable Men which his Chancellor hath met with in this his last Visitation; but they have received such Censure, as their Faults deserved, or else submitted themselves. Only Mr. <hi>John Knolles</hi> a Lecturer at <hi>Colchester,</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born to receive the Holy Communion for two Years, since he came to be Lecturer: And being enjoyned to perform that Duty within a Month, he was so zealous, as that he forsook Lecture and Town and all, rather than he would receive the Communion.</p>
                     <p>I find likewise in this Account, 28 Ministers Convented before the Chancellor for some Inconformities. And five for excess in Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But there is as good Order taken with them as could be.</p>
                     <p>The Lectures in this Diocess continue many: But there is great care taken to keep them in order.</p>
                     <p>I find in the Diocess of <hi>Winchester,</hi> divers Recusants newly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: <note place="margin">Winton.</note> But whether they be newly perverted, doth not appear by <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> I desire to know the certaintie of this.</note> my Lord the Bishops Account to me.</p>
                     <p>There are some five complained of for not Catechising, which I shall require of the Bishop to see remedied.</p>
                     <p>Here my Lord the Bishop Certifies, that he is very careful, and <note place="margin">Ely.</note> sees all things done according to your Majesty's Instructions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="548" facs="tcp:54614:286"/>
My Lord the Bishop of this Diocess, dyed before the time came, <note place="margin">Rochester.</note> that he was to give up his Accounts; so that I can relate nothing upon certainty; but shall give the succeeding Bishop Charge to be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, because his Predecessor lay languishing, and was able to look to little for three whole Years before his Death.</p>
                     <p>The Account from hence is very brief. But my Lord is confident, <note place="margin">Sarum.</note> that his Diocess is clean through in good Order; and I will hope it is so.</p>
                     <p>My Lord of <hi>Peterburgh</hi> hath taken a great deal of pains, and <note place="margin">Peterburgh.</note> brought his Diocess into very good order. Only he saith, there are three Lecturers in the same; one at <hi>Northampton,</hi> but that is read by the Vicar of the place; one at <hi>Rowel,</hi> which hath Maintenance allowed; and a third at <hi>Daventree,</hi> maintained by the Contribution of the Town. And this last I think the Bishop had need take care of.</p>
                     <p>This Diocess appears by my Lord's Certificate, to be in marvelous <note place="margin">Bath and Wells.</note> good order for all things; and a great Reformation hath been wrought there by his Care and Industry.</p>
                     <p>For Popish Recusants, the number of them is there much decreased; neither are any newly presented for Recusancy.</p>
                     <p>My Lord the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> is not (as your Majesty knows) in <note place="margin">Lincoln.</note> case to make any Return for his Diocess. And since the Jurisdiction thereof came by his Suspension into my Hands, I have neither had time nor leisure to make any great Inquiry how conformable in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or Discipline Men in those parts are. Yet this I find, that both in <hi>Buckinghamshire</hi> and in <hi>Bedfordshire,</hi> there are many too refractory to all good Order. And there are a great number of very poor and miserable Vicarages and Curatships in many parts of this large Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, and which are almost past all cure and hope of help, unless by your Majesties Grace and Favour some may be had.</p>
                     <p>My Lord of <hi>Norwich</hi> hath been very careful of all your Majesty's <note place="margin">Norwich.</note> Instructions. And upon the 24th of <hi>September</hi> last, being then in his Diocess, and giving Orders, he refused to admit five well Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and well Mannered Men, because they wanted a sufficient Title according to the Canon of the Church.</p>
                     <p>I find that there are in this Diocess six Lectures, namely at <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondham, North-walsham, East-Earling, Norwich, Linn,</hi> and <hi>Bungay:</hi> But they are all performed by Conformable and Neighbouring Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and under such Conditions and Rules as my Lord their Bishop hath prescribed them. Only that at <hi>Bungay</hi> is inhibited for a time, at the entreaty of some of their own Company, and for Misdemeanours in it. As for the single Lecturers, my Lord hath had a special Eye over them.</p>
                     <p>

Your Majesties Letters, requiring the Mayor, Sheriffs and Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, &amp;c. to repair on Sundays to Divine Service and Sermons, at the Cathedral in <hi>Norwich,</hi> are very well observed by the most of them. But Complaint is brought to the Bishop against one <hi>Thomas King,</hi> who is held a factious and a dangerous Man, and he frequently ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents himself from the Cathedral, and it is doubted that his ill Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will make others neglect their Duties.</p>
                     <p>Divine Service, both for Prayers, Catechism and Sermons, is diligently frequented; and that beyond what could suddainly be hoped for in such a Diocess, and in the midst of the humorousness of this Age.</p>
                     <p>Of those which stood under Episcopal Censure, or that fled to <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C.

Yet his Lordship hath had patience (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing a peremptory Citation sent out) hitherto to expect them: But now must proceed to Deprivation, or suffer Scorn and Contempt to follow upon all his Injunctions. Nevertheless, herein he humbly craves direction, and so do I, if it please your Majesty to give it.</p>
                     <p>His Lordship likewise, very carefully and necessarily (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) craves direction for these Particulars following.
<list>
                           <item>1. Divers Towns are depopulated; no Houses left standing, but the Mannor House and the Church, and that turned to the Lord's Barn, or worse use; and no Service done in it, though the Parsonages or Vicarages be presentative.</item>
                           <item>2. In other Towns the Church is ruined, and the Inhabitants thrust upon Neighbouring Parishes, where they fill the Church, and pay few or no Duties.</item>
                           <item>3. At <hi>Carrowe</hi> Close by <hi>Norwich,</hi> there are twelve Houses, some of them fair, reputed to be of no Parish, and so an ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle for Recusant Papists, and other Separatists, to the great prejudice of that Neighbouring City.</item>
                           <item>4. At <hi>Lanwood</hi> near <hi>New-Market,</hi> and in <hi>Burwell</hi> the Mother Church stands; but the Roof suffered to decay within the Memory of Man, and the Bells sold, and the Hamlet quite slipt out of all Jurisdiction <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap>. That Church was an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation to the Abby of <hi>Ramsey,</hi> and is now in Sir <hi>William Russell's</hi> Hands.</item>
                           <item>5. The Churchyards in many places are extreamly Annoyed and Profaned, especially in Corporate Towns. And at St. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds-Bury,</hi> the Assizes are Yearly kept in a remote side of the Churchyard, and a common Ale-House stands in the
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:54614:287"/>
middle of the Yard: The like abuses by Ale-Houses, Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doors, and throwing out of Filth, with something else not fit to be related here, are found at <hi>Bungay:</hi> At St. <hi>Maries ad Turrim</hi> in <hi>Ipswich,</hi> at <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> and at <hi>Norwich,</hi> the Sign-Posts of two or three Inns stand in the Church-yard. Of remedy for these Abuses, the Bishop is utterly in despair, unless your Majesty be pleased to take some special Order for them: Because <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>C. R.</hi> Let him doe his Duty, and I shall take care, that no Prohibition shall trouble him in this case.</note> they which have these Back-doors into Church-yards or common Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, will plead Prescription, and then a Prohibition will be granted against the Ecclesiastical Proceedings.</item>
                           <item>6: Lastly, his Lordship Certifies, that divers, not only Churches, but Town-ships themselves, are in danger of utter ruin by a breach of the Sea. And there was provision made by Act of Parliament, in the Seventh Year of your Majesty's Royal Father of Blessed Memory for redress of it: But nothing being since done, it will now cost five times as much to remedy as <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>C. R.</hi> Herein I shall not faile to doe my Part.</note> then it would. But the Bishop is in good hope great good may yet be done, if your Majesty will be graciously pleased to appear in it, upon such Humble Petition as he and I shall make to Your Majesty.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Bishop of this Diocess assures me, that all things are in very <note place="margin">Exon.</note> good Order there. And indeed I think the Diocess is well amended within these few Years, his Lordship having been very careful both in his Visitations and otherwise.</p>
                     <p>This Year, by reason of the return of divers that were Captives in <hi>Morocco,</hi> and having been Inhabitants of those Western Parts, there arose in my Lord the Bishop a Doubt, how they, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced their Saviour, and become <hi>Turks,</hi> might be readmitted into the Church of Christ, and under what Penitential Form. His Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship at his last being in <hi>London</hi> spake with me about it, and we agreed on a Form, which was afterwards drawn up, and approved by the Right Reverend Fathers in God my Lords the Bishops of <hi>London, Ely</hi> and <hi>Norwich,</hi> and is now setled by your Majesty's Appointment; and I shall take care to see it Registred here, and have given Charge to my Lord of <hi>Exon</hi> to see it Registred below, to remain as a Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for future times, if there should be any more sad Examples of Apostacy from the Faith.</p>
                     <p>Whereas your Majesty hath lately been graciously pleased to grant <note place="margin">Oxford:</note> the ordering of the Woods of <hi>Shotover</hi> and <hi>Stowe</hi> by Lease, to the Lord Bishop of <hi>Oxford;</hi> his Lordship assures me, that there is a great deal of Care taken, and a great deal of Charge laid out by him and his Tenant for the Preservation and well ordering of the Woods there.</p>
                     <p>He hath likewise been very careful concerning Recusants within
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:54614:287"/>
that Diocess: But saith that divers of them pretend and shew their Exemptions, that <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> Lett mee see those exemptions and then I shall declare my further Pleasure.</note> they should not be troubled for matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Religion in any Ecclesiastical Courts; which hath made his Lordship for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear till your Majesty's Pleasure be farther known.</p>
                     <p>For Lectures, there are none in that Diocess, save one at <hi>Henly</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Thames;</hi> Preached by the Incumbent, an orderly Man; and in the Peculiars at <hi>Tame</hi> and <hi>Banbury;</hi> but they are out of the Bishop's Jurisdiction.</p>
                     <p>My Lord Bishop of this See hath taken great care in his first <note place="margin">Bristol.</note> Visitation; and if he continue that care (as I doubt not but he will) he will quickly settle that Diocess into better Order. But he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of the Dean and Chapter (for whose Benefit he hath lately made many good Injunctions) that they will not consent that Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Pounds <hi>per An.</hi> ordered by their Statute, for the Repairing of High-Ways, may be turned to the necessary supply of their Quire, in regard that 100 <hi>l. per An.</hi> is lately given by Dr. <hi>White</hi> towards the Repair of the same High-Ways. But this, and other things if <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R</hi> Doe soe.</note> your Majesty thinks fit, I can easily alter when I come to revise their Statutes, or by a Command from your Majesty in the mean time.</p>
                     <p>He farther complains, that his Predecessor, Bishop <hi>Wright</hi> (now Bishop of <hi>Lichfield</hi>) detains in his custody, all the Writings belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Cromhall,</hi> the Lease which your Majesty by your Royal Letters commanded should expire and return to the Bishoprick. And sure, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> I shall.</note> if this be so, it is very fit he be commanded to restore them out of Hand.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, he complains, that they of the preciser Faction do eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Day endeavour to disquiet the People, and that by strange In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions. And at present they give out, that the Liturgy Printed for <hi>Scotland,</hi> hath in it sundry Notorious Points of Popery, &amp;c. Which troubles the People, and doth much harm otherwise. The like is certified me from the Bishop of <hi>Exon,</hi> concerning Rumours raised in those Parts.</p>
                     <p>My Lord Bishop of <hi>Chichester</hi> is in a Quartan-Ague, besides his <note place="margin">Chichester.</note> old Diseases of the Stone and the Gout: I pray God comfort him. But I do not hear from him, that there is much amiss in that Diocess.</p>
                     <p>The Bishop of this Diocess certifies me, that your Majesty's <note place="margin">Hereford.</note> Instructions are in all things carefully observed, and he hath used the utmost Diligence he can, in reclaiming of Recusants; and such as will not conform themselves, he hath taken a strict Course, to have them proceeded withal, and granted <hi>Significavits</hi> against divers.</p>

In this Diocess, my Lord's Words are, That there is nothing but <note place="margin">St. <hi>Asaph.</hi>
                        </note> common Peace, and universal Conformity.</p>
                     <p>My Lord of <hi>Landaff</hi> hath been very careful for the setling of the <note place="margin">Landaff.</note> Rights and Profits of this Bishoprick; and God hath Blessed his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours therein. And for the Government, he professes, that in his late Visitation he hath not found one Schismatical Minister, or Non-Conformist in the Diocess.</p>
                     <p>The Bishop of this See was Consecrated but a little before <note place="margin">Bangor.</note> 
                        <hi>Michaelmas</hi> last; and, by your Majesty's leave, hath not been yet in his Diocess; and so for this broken part of the Year is able to give no Account.</p>
                     <p>My Lord the Bishop Certifies, that he is less troubled with Non-Conformists <note place="margin">Worcester.</note> since Mr: <hi>Wheatly</hi> of <hi>Banbury</hi> gave over his Lecture at <hi>Stratford</hi> within that Diocess. And that during this heavy Visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at <hi>Worcester,</hi> he hath caused the Lectures to cease in that Town.</p>

                     <p>ACcording to my bounden Duty, and your Majesty's Commands, expressed in your Instructions for the good of the Clergy, I here present my Account for the Year last past, 1638.</p>
                     <p>And First, to begin with my self and my own Diocess, I have been <note place="margin">Canterbury.</note> careful to obey all your Majesty's particular Instructions, both for the residing upon my Houses, and preserving of my Woods, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>There was one <hi>Bedle</hi> a Minister of <hi>Essex,</hi> came into this Diocess; and at <hi>Harbledown</hi> near <hi>Canterbury</hi> (the Curate there being dead) Preached very disorderly, three hours together at a time, and got himself many ignorant followers. But so soon as ever he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after by my Officers, he fled the Country, and I purpose, God willing, to speak with the Chancellor of <hi>London</hi> concerning him.</p>
                     <p>I do not find that there is either any increase or decrease of <hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Puritans</hi> in the Diocess. But the Separatists about <hi>Ashford,</hi> are very busie, miserable poor, and out of that, bold against all Church Censure; so that without some Temporal Assistance from the Judges we know not what to do: And this I have often and humbly represented. Yet two <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> Demand theire helpe and if they refuse, I shall make them assist you.</note> notorious Separatists being call'd in question, are fled the Country, and one of them brake Prison.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Tenterden</hi> some People are somewhat refractory; but the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon assures me, he hath great hope to reduce them; which I shall be glad of.</p>
                     <p>The Strangers at <hi>Canterbury</hi> do reasonably well obey my Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for coming to our Churches, and I shall give them all Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, holding it fitting to keep a moderate Hand with them.</p>
                     <p>In the Diocess and City of <hi>London,</hi> there was like to be some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction, <note place="margin">London.</note> both among the Ministers and the People, occasioned at first, by some over-nice Curiosities, Preached by one Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> Vicar of St. <hi>Stephens</hi> in <hi>Coleman-street,</hi> concerning the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness in the Justification of a Sinner. But the differences arising about it were timely prevented by Convention of the Parties dissenting. And so, God be thanked, that Business is at peace.</p>

                        <pb n="554" facs="tcp:54614:289"/>
There is but one noted refractory Person that stands out in that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocess, and he is now under Suspension.</p>
                     <p>My Lord the Bishop's Certificate informs me, that there are a <note place="margin">Winton.</note> great many Recusants within that Diocess; and that in some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> their Children are not brought to be Baptized in the Church, which I shall require the Bishop to take special care of.</p>
                     <p>This Diocess being now in my Charge, I do humbly certifie your <note place="margin">Lincoln.</note> Majesty, that one part of <hi>Buckinghamshire,</hi> and some places in <hi>Lincoln</hi> and <hi>Leicestershires</hi> are somewhat disorderly. But I do not find any Man presented unto me for any wilful Refractoriness, save one, whom Ih ave caused to be called into the High Commission Court.</p>
                     <p>There are in <hi>Lincolnshire</hi> many miserable poor Vicarages and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateships. Might your Majesty's Reign be so blest, as that they might in time find some relief. But this is quite beyond Episcopal Power.</p>
                     <p>In this Diocess my Lord hath taken care of all your Majesty's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, <note place="margin">Oxon.</note> and assures me that there is no Lecture in any Market Town within his Diocess, except at <hi>Henley,</hi> which is performed by their own Minister, a discreet Man. As for that which was begun by private Persons in the Chappel of your Majesty's Mannor House at <hi>Woodstocke,</hi> and might have been of very dangerous, both Example and Consequence, the Bishop hath carefully suppressed it by your Majesty's Gracious Command upon his Petition.</p>
                     <p>There is no Complaint in this Diocess, but only of one Mr. <hi>Ephraim</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Worcester.</note> 
                        <hi>Hewet</hi> of <hi>Wraxhall</hi> in <hi>Warwickshire,</hi> who hath taken upon him to keep Fasts in his Parish, by his own appointment, and hath contemned the decent Ceremonies commanded by the Church. My Lord the Bishop proceeds against him, and intends either to reform or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish him.</p>
                     <p>In this Diocess the Bishop assures me that all things go very order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Exon.</note> and well, saving that divers Impropriators suffer willing Ruins (as he conceives) in the Churches, which belong unto them; wherein he humbly craves both Advice and Aid, that it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied.</p>
                     <p>There was one Mr. <hi>Workeman,</hi> sometimes a Lecturer at <hi>Glocester,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Hereford.</note> and for Inconformity in a very high degree, put from that place, by Sentence of the High Commission Court. Since that, this Man hath been received into the House of one Mr. <hi>Kyrle</hi> of <hi>Wallford,</hi> and lived there without any Cure or other known Imployment. The Bishop hearing of him, and resolving to call him in Question, if he did not Conform himself, he hath suddenly left that Diocess, and is gone God knows whether.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="555" facs="tcp:54614:289"/>
There were some other Complaints put up, which I certified to the Bishop: But his Lordship hath given me a fair Answer, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures me, that by his care and vigilancy they shall all be rectified, and that out of hand.</p>
                     <p>My Lord informs me, that in his Predecessor Bishop <hi>Whites</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, <note place="margin">Ely.</note> he living most commonly at <hi>London,</hi> being your Majesty's Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner, there was cut down and wasted above a Thousand Loads of Wood.</p>
                     <p>For all other businesses they are in good condition within that Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, saving that my Lord the Bishop humbly craves leave hereby, to represent a great grievance to your Majesty, which concerns the Bishoprick, the Dean and Chapter, and all other Clergy Men (or indeed rather all your Majesty's Liege People) inhabiting within the Isle of <hi>Ely.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this Diocess, the Bishop found out one <hi>Jeffryes,</hi> who common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Bristol.</note> Administred the Blessed Sacrament of the Eucharist, being either not in Holy Orders at all, or at least not a Priest: So soon as he was discovered, he slipt out of the Diocess; and the Bishop thinks, that he now serves in a Peculiar under the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Wells.</hi> I will send thither to know the certainty, and see the abuse punished, if I can light upon the Person.</p>
                     <p>The Bishop further Certifies me, that there are very many within that small Diocess, who stand Excommunicate, and divers of them only for not payment of Fees: And again, that many of these are not able to pay them. I think it were not amiss, that once every Year in <hi>Lent,</hi> the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> In this ye have very great reason, for it is not fit that the Sentence of Excommunication should stand longer then it needs must.</note> were commanded to take an Account of all the Excommunicats in the Diocess, and to cause all to be Absolved that shall be fit for Absolution; and particularly, to see that no Man be suffered to continue Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, where nothing but Poverty hinders the payment of Duties or other Fees. The Bishop likewise informs me, that Monuments even of obscure and mean Persons, are grown very common in those Parts, and prejudicial both to the Walls and Pillars, and Liberty of Churches, which the Bishop opposes as much and as fairly as he can: But all is too little.</p>
                     <p>There were in this Diocess the last year but two Refractory Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters <note place="margin">Landaff.</note> known to the Bishop, Mr. <hi>Wroth</hi> and Mr: <hi>Erbury:</hi> The former hath submitted; but the other would neither submit, nor satisfie his Parishioners, to whom he had given publick offence; so he resigned his Vicarage, and hath left thereby the Diocess in peace.</p>
                     <p>For this Diocess, the Bishop humbly craves your Majesty's Pardon, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>St.</hi> Davids.</note> for his longer stay in <hi>London</hi> than ordinary, and professes his Excuse
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:54614:290"/>
formerly made to your Majesty to be most true, <hi>viz.</hi> That he was forced to it by extremity of Sickness falling upon him in those parts, and forcing his change of Air.</p>
                     <p>That Diocess hath been a little out of quiet this year, by some Mens medling with those <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> It is no wonder that this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is imperfect, since the Bishop's Sicknes gives him an excuse for absence.</note> nice Questions, which your Majesty hath forbidden should be commonly preached in the Pulpit. But the Relation being somewhat imperfect, I shall inform my self farther, and then give your Majesty such Account as I receive.</p>
                     <p>In this Diocess, the Bishop Certifies me two considerable things, <note place="margin">Bangor.</note> and both of them are of difficult Cure. The one concerns his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick, where every thing is let for Lives by his Predecessors to the very Mill that Grinds his Corn. The other concerns the Diocess in general, where, by Reason of the Poverty of the Place, all Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-Men of Hope and Worth, seek Preferment elsewhere. And he tells me plainly, some weak Scholars must be Ordained, or else some Cures must be left altogether unsupplied.</p>
                     <p>My Lord of <hi>Glocester</hi> confesseth he hath <note place="margin">Glocester.</note> been absent from his Diocess a good part of <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> This is well enough if he have left his desire of further absenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</note> this Year, being kept from his Dwelling-Houses, by the Infection at <hi>Glocester,</hi> which just Cause of Absence he humbly submits to your most gracious Majesty.</p>
                     <p>Concerning that Diocess the Bishop speaks not much more: But the Arch-Deacon at his Visitation, finding the Clergy conformable, gave them this grave and fitting Admonition, <hi>viz.</hi> That no Man should presume his conformity should excuse him, if in the mean time his Life were Scandalous. Which was very necessary for that Place, and these Times. And the Arch-Deacon certifies farther, that there are divers, which as far as they dare, oppose Catechising; and but for fear of losing the Livings, would almost go as far as <hi>Burton</hi> and <hi>Bastwick</hi> did, which is his own expression under his Hand.</p>
                     <p>My Lord the Bishop there complains much of the Decay of his <note place="margin">Norwich.</note> Houses, and the impoverishing of that Bishoprick by some of his Predecessors. And this partly by letting of long Leases before the Statute restrained it, and partly by a coarse exchange of some Lands in former times. This latter cannot now be helped; but for the decay of his Houses, if he pursue that faculty which I granted to his immediate Predecessor, he may help a great part of that decay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much charge. And this, God willing, I shall put him in mind to do, and give him the best assistance that I can by Law.</p>
                     <p>For the Churches in that Diocess (which are very many) my Lord acknowledges, that they are in very decent and good order generally.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="557" facs="tcp:54614:290"/>
The only thing which he saith troubles his Diocess is, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have been required to come up and receive at the Rail which is set before the Communion-Table, and that heretofore many have been Excommunicated or Suspended for not doing so. For the thing it self, it is certainly the most decent and orderly way, and is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised by your Majesty, and by the Lords in your own Chappel, and now almost every where else. And upon my knowledge, hath been long used in St: <hi>Giles</hi> his Church without <hi>Cripplegate London,</hi> with marvellous Decency and Ease; and yet in that Parish there are not so few as Two Thousand Communicants, more than within any Parish in <hi>Norwich</hi> Diocess: And when your Majesty had the Hearing of this Business, in the now Bishop of <hi>Ely's</hi> Time, you highly appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it. And therefore, I presume, you will be pleased to command <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> I doe soe.</note> that the present Bishop continue it, and look carefully to it. And whereas they plead that many stood suspended for it, the Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> in whose Time it was, doth assure me, that in above One Thousand Three Hundred Parishes, there were not Thirteen either Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated or Suspended for refusing of this.</p>
                     <p>In this Diocess, the Bishop gives a fair Account to all your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's <note place="margin">Lichfield.</note> Instructions; so that I have cause to hope, that that Diocess is in reasonable good Order: Only he complains, that his Predecessors have Leased out part of his House at <hi>Lichfield,</hi> which puts him to very great Annoyance: But he is entring into a Legal way for redress of his Abuse; in which I presume your Majesty will give him all <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> I shall.</note> fair and just Assistance, if he shall be forc'd to crave the same.</p>
                     <p>My Lord the Bishop came but lately to this See, and hath not as <note place="margin">Chichester.</note> yet found much amiss.</p>
                     <p>The Bishop of that Diocess is Dead, and no other yet setled; so <note place="margin">Peterborough</note> I can have no Account from thence this Year.</p>
                     <p>These Four Bishops Certifie, that all things are orderly and well <note place="margin">Sarum. Bath and Wells. Rochester. <hi>S.</hi> Asaph.</note> within their several Diocesses.</p>
                     <p>And so with my Prayers for your Majesty's long Life, and happy Reign; I humbly submit this my Account for the Year last past, being: 1638.</p>

                     <p>ACcording to your Royal Commands expressed in your Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for the good of the Church, I here most humbly Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent this my Account for the Year finished now at <hi>Christmas</hi> 1639.</p>
                     <p>And First, to begin with my own Diocess. The great thing which <note place="margin">Canterbury.</note> is amiss there, and beyond my Power to remedy, is the stiffness of divers <hi>Anabaptists</hi> and Separatists from the Church of <hi>England;</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in, and about the Parts near <hi>Ashford.</hi> And I do not find, either by my own Experience, or by any Advice from my Officers, that this is like to be remedied, unless the Statute concerning Abjuration <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> It were not amisse to speake with the Keeper about this.</note> of your Kingdom, or some other way by the Power of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Law or State be thought upon. But how fit that may be to be done for the present, especially in these broken Times, I humbly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to your Majesty's Wisdom, having often complained of this before.</p>
                     <p>Many that were brought to good Order for receiving of the Holy Communion, where the Rails stand before the Table, are now of late fallen off, and refuse to come up thither to receive. But this, God willing, I shall take care of, and order as well as I can, and with as much speed. And the same is now commonly fallen out in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Diocesses.</p>
                     <p>There was about half a Year since, one that pretended himself a Minister, who got many Followers in <hi>Sandwich,</hi> and some Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Parishes; but at last, was found to have gone under three Names, <hi>Enoch, Swann,</hi> and <hi>Grey;</hi> and in as several Habits, of a Minister, an ordinary Lay-Man, and a Royster. And this being discovered, he fled the Country, before any of my Officers could lay hold on him. Upon this occasion, I have commanded my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary and Arch-Deacon to give Charge in my Name, to all Parsons and Vicars of my Diocess, that they suffer no Man to preach in their Cures, but such as for whom they will Answer, as well otherwise, as for the point of Conformity; which I hope will prevent the like abuse hereafter.</p>
                     <p>In this Diocess, the last Year, there was some heat struck by oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site <note place="margin">London.</note> Preaching in the Pulpit, between one Mr: <hi>Goodwin</hi> Vicar of St: <hi>Stevens</hi> in <hi>Coleman-street,</hi> and some other Ministers in the City, concerning the Act of Believing, and the Imputation of <hi>Christ's</hi>
                        <pb n="559" facs="tcp:54614:291"/>
Righteousness in the Justification of a Sinner. And the Peoples Minds were much perplexed hereabouts. This business was quieted by my Lord the Bishop and his Chancellour, and a Promise of Forbearance made: Yet now lately Mr: <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath preached again in the same way, and the same Perplexity is like to be caused again thereby in the City. Yet my Lord the Bishop is in hopes to settle this also quietly; wherein he shall have the best Assistance I can give him.</p>
                     <p>The Arch-Deacons in this Diocess and others, are too negligent in giving their Bishops due Information of such things as are committed to their Charge.</p>
                     <p>Mr: <hi>Joseph Simonds,</hi> Rector of St: <hi>Martin's Ironmonger-lane,</hi> is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fallen from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and hath abandoned his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and gone beyond the Seas; and so was deprived in <hi>September</hi> last past. Mr: <hi>Daniel Votyer,</hi> Rector of St: <hi>Peter's</hi> in <hi>Westcheap,</hi> hath been likewise convented for divers Inconformities, and promised Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Mr: <hi>Simonds</hi> also did; but being now called into the High Commission, Order is taken for the Officiating of his Cure, till it shall appear, whether he will desert it, or no; for he also is gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas.</p>
                     <p>Mr: <hi>George Seaton,</hi> Rector of <hi>Bushy</hi> in the County of <hi>Hertford,</hi> is charged with continual Non-residency, and other Misdemeanours, little beseeming a Clergy-man. But of this, neither my Lord nor my self can say more to your Majesty, till we see what will rise in Proof against him.</p>
                     <p>My Lord, the Bishop of this Diocess, gives me a very fair Account <note place="margin">Winton.</note> of all things regular therein; saving, that the <hi>Popish</hi> Recusants, which, he saith, are many in that Diocess, do yearly increase there; and that this may appear by the Bills of Presentment in his Annual Inquisitions.</p>
                     <p>My Lord the Bishop informs me, that he hath been very careful in <note place="margin">Oxford.</note> point of Ordination, as being a Bishop near the University, and to whom many resort for Holy Orders at times appointed by the Church. But he complains, that having refused to give Orders to Twenty or Thirty at an Ordination, most of them have addressed themselves to other Bishops, and of them received Orders, not only without Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Dimissory, but without such Qualification as the Canon requires.</p>
                     <p>In this Case I would humbly advise your Majesty, That my Lord <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> Command him in my name to doe soe.</note> the Bishop may enquire, and certifie by what Bishops these Parties so refused by him, were Admitted into Holy Orders, that so they may be admonished to be more careful for the future; and that this Abuse may not find Encouragement, and increase.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Popish</hi> Recusants, they have been proceeded against in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocess according to Law, saving only such of them as have pleaded, and shewed your Majesty's Exemption under your Great Seal, from
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:54614:292"/>
being question'd in any Ecclesisiastical Court for matters concerning their Religion.</p>
                     <p>I find by the Bishop's Certificate, that he hath constantly resided <note place="margin">Conventry and Lich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.</note> upon his Episcopal Houses; but saith, that he cannot have his Health at <hi>Eccleshall,</hi> and hath therefore since resided in his Palace at <hi>Lichfield;</hi> but with very little Comfort, by reason of Inmates, left, as his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship saith, upon the Church's Possession. His Lordship adds, That he hath an ancient Palace at <hi>Coventry</hi> in Lease, but with reservation of the Use thereof, in case the Bishop shall at any time come to live <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</note> there. Here he means to reside for a time, if it stand with your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's good liking.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Popish</hi> Recusants, his Lordship saith, they are presented and prosecuted according to the Law.</p>
                     <p>This Diocess, my Lord the Bishop assures me, is as quiet, uniform, <note place="margin">Norwich.</note> and conformable, as any in the Kingdom, if not more. And doth avow it, that all which stood out in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> as well as <hi>Norfolk,</hi> at his coming to that See, are come in, and have now legally subscribed, and professed all Conformity; and for ought he can learn, observe it accordingly. Yet his Lordship confesseth, that some of the Vulgar sort in <hi>Suffolk</hi> are not conformable enough, especially in coming up to Receive at the Steps of the Chancel, where the Rails are set: But he hopes by fair means he shall be able to work upon them in time.</p>
                     <p>His Lordship adds, That some have Indicted a Minister, because he would not come down from the Communion Table to give them the Sacrament in their Seats. But this your Majesty hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly acquainted with by the Minister's Petition, which you were graciously pleased to command me to underwrite, and send to the Lord Chief Justice, who rides that Circuit; which I did accordingly; and hope your Majesty will be pleased to take Care, that there may be some Settlement in this Particular.</p>
                     <p>My Lord the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> informs me, That Sir <hi>John Cutts,</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman <note place="margin">Ely.</note> near <hi>Cambridge,</hi> keeps a Chaplain, being not thereto (as he conceives) qualify'd by Law. Sir <hi>John</hi> pretends, that he keeps him as a Curate to the Parson. The Case, may it please your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, is this: In the Town of <hi>Childerly</hi> there were of old two Parishes, <hi>Magna &amp; Parva:</hi> The one was long since wasted and lost; the other remains Presentative. But the whole Town is depopulated, except the Knight's House; and the Church is gone; upon the decayed Walls whereof stand mean Houses of Office, as Brewhouse, Stable, &amp;c. Upon this Rectory the Knight ever provides to have a Titular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent, who now is one Mr: <hi>Rainbowe,</hi> a Fellow of <hi>S: Magdalen</hi> College in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and Houshold Chaplain to the Earl of <hi>Suffolk.</hi> What Allowance the Knight makes him is not known. Tithes he takes none. The Knight and his Family go to no other Church: But he hath a Chappel, which, he saith, was Consecrated by Bishop <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi> and produces an Instrument with Seal, purporting, that on
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:54614:292"/>
such a day at <hi>Childerly,</hi> Bishop <hi>Heton</hi> did Consecrate a Chappel, by saying Service there himself, and having a Sermon. Now upon colour hereof, the Knight entertains a Stipendary, who is termed his Chaplain, and pays him a Stipend; but he is neither appointed nor payed by the Incumbent.</p>
                     <p>The Bishop questioning the whole business, hath required him to attend me, to know whether such a Consecration be to be allowed of. And if it be, then whether I will allow of a Chappel in that place instead of a Parish Church, now diverted to other profane Uses. Of this I shall take the best care I can, by advice of the ablest Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians: And in the mean time certifie your Majesty, that the Bishop hath reason to be as strict in this as he may, because there is a good Rectory devoured by this means, and that almost in the view of the University of <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I likewise find by my Lord the Bishop's Account, that there are divers Particulars of moment, and very fit for redress, presented to him in his late (yet being his first) Visitation, and most of them in the University and Town of <hi>Cambridge.</hi> As namely, that <hi>Emanuel, Sidney</hi> and <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Colleges have certain Rooms built within the Memory of Man, which they use for Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels to all Holy Uses; yet were never Consecrated. That most of the Church-Yards within the Town of <hi>Cambridge</hi> are annoyed and profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Dwelling-Houses and Shops, and part of them turned in Gardens, where by digging, the Bones of the Dead have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed; with divers other Profanations; as namely, the Church-Yards of St: <hi>Michaels,</hi> St: <hi>Marys,</hi> St: <hi>Bennets,</hi> and of St: <hi>Botolphs:</hi> And far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that in most of the Chancels of the Churches in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> there are common Seats over-high and unfitting that place in divers Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects. In all which businesses the Bishop hath been very tender, both out of his respect to his Mother the University of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and because divers of the Benefices in <hi>Cambridge</hi> are Impropriations belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to some Colleges there; yet is pleased to ask my Direction here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as I most humbly do your Majesty's. And herein, if your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty so please, I think it may be fit to consider well of the ill Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if Three College Chappels shall be used without any Consecration. And for the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> It must not bee.</note> Profanations and disorderly Seats, I think, if an Admonition would amend them, it were well given. But if that prevail not, the High-Commission <note place="margin">You are in the Right, for if faire meanes will not, power must redresse it.</note> may order it, if your Majesty so please. And I hope my Lord the Bishop should not have had all this to do at his first coming into that Diocess, if I could have held my Metropolitical Visitation of that See before this time: From performance of which Duty, I have been bold heretofore to acquaint your Majesty what hath hindred me.</p>
                     <p>There are also divers poor Cures within Six or Seven Miles round about <hi>Cambridge,</hi> which are served by some Fellows, or other Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:54614:293"/>
of Colleges within the University, who, being many of them Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendaries, go or send thither upon Sundays, and perchance on Holy-Days to read Service; but are absent all the rest of the Week from all necessary Duties of their Cure. And by this means, the Parishi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners want such necessary help and comfort in all time of Sickness, either of them, or their Families. Against this, I have taken the best care I can in <hi>Oxford.</hi> But how to effect it in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not so well, being not acquainted with the course of that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity. There hapned also in the Town of <hi>Tadlow</hi> a very ill Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on <hi>Christmas-day,</hi> 1638. by reason of not having the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-Table railed in, that it might be kept from Profanations. For in Sermon time a Dog came to the Table, and took the Loaf of Bread prepared for the Holy Sacrament, in his Mouth, and ran away with it. Some of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> took the same from the Dog, and set it again upon the Table. After Sermon, the Minister could not think fit to Consecrate this Bread; and other fit for the Sacrament was not to be had in that Town; and the Day so far spent, they could not send for it to another Town: So there was no Communion. And this was Presented by Four Sworn Men of the Town aforesaid.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, it was likewise Presented to the Bishop, that about Forty Years ago, one Sir <hi>Francis Hind</hi> did pull down the Church of St: <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> in <hi>Histon,</hi> to which then appertained a Vicarage Presentative, and forc'd the Parishioners to thrust themselves upon another small Church in the said Town, to the great wrong of the Parishioners thereof. And that the Lead, Timber, Stones, Bells, and all other <note place="margin">

                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>:</hi> And that now it is called in question, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (not being able of themselves to re-edifie the Church) can get no redress against the Descendents from the said Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> because the Heir was a Child, and in Wardship to your Majesty.</p>
                     <p>There is notice come to my Lord the Bishop of some <hi>Brownists</hi> in <note place="margin">Hereford.</note> that part of his Diocess adjoyning to <hi>Wales,</hi> which Schismatically preach dangerous Errours, and stir up the People to follow them. And when they hear of any Enquiry made after them, they slip out into another Diocess. But the Bishop promises to do his best to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them. But howsoever, your Majesty may hereby see how these Schisms increase in all parts of your Dominions.</p>
                     <p>This Diocess is in good order; and there was lately given Ten <note place="margin">Bristol.</note> Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> for Four Solemn Sermons, to be preached An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually for ever, which the Bishop hath ordered very well.</p>
                     <p>In this Diocess, Catechising in the Afternoon by Question and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, <note place="margin">Peterburgh.</note> is generally well observed; though some Men do preach also in the Afternoon. In this Particular, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop craves to receive Direction, whether he <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> Soe that Catechizng be first duely performed let them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> a Sermon after that if theye desire it.</note> shall command them to Catechise only, and not Preach; because your Majesty's Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons seem to be strict in this point. I think
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:54614:293"/>
your Majesty may be pleased to have the Ministers to preach if they will, so that they do first Catechise orderly by Question and Answer, and afterwards preach upon the same Heads to the People, for their better understanding of those Questions.</p>
                     <p>Besides, some Knights and Esquires keep Schoolmasters in their Houses, or Scholars to converse with, or dyet the Vicar, where his Maintenance is little: And this they say is not to keep a Chaplain, which your Majesty's Instructions forbid. Yet most of these read or say Service in their Houses, (which is the Office of a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain) But they read not the Prayers of the Church, according to the Liturgy Established. The Bishop craves direction in this also. And I think it be very necessary, that the Bishop proceed strictly, and keep all such, that <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C. R.</hi> It is most necessary that the Bishop observe this that you mention, strictly.</note> they read or say no Prayers, but those which are allowed and established by the Church, in the Book of Common Prayers.</p>
                     <p>There are not observed more than Seven or Eight throughout the whole Diocess which seem refractory to the Church; and they have made large professions of their Conformities, which the Bishop will settle so soon as he can. But this he saith he finds plainly, that there are few of the Laity Factious, but where the Clergy misleads them. And this I doubt is too true in most parts of the Kingdom. They have in this Diocess come to him very thick to receive Confirmation, to the number of some Thousands.</p>
                     <p>There were two Lectures held this last Year, the one at <hi>Wainfleet,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Lincoln.</note> and the other at <hi>Kirton</hi> in <hi>Lindsey,</hi> where some two or three of the Ministers, which read the Lecture, were disorderly. Among the rest, one Mr. <hi>Show</hi> preached very Factiously, just at the time when your Majesty was at <hi>Barwicke,</hi> and his Fellow Lecturers complained not of him. Hereupon the Chancellor having notice of it, called him in question; and the business was so foul, and so fully proved, that the party fled the Country, and is thought to be gone for <hi>New-England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some other small Exorbitances there are, which the Chancellor complains of: But there is hope that this Example will do some good among them.</p>
                     <p>In this Diocess, one Mr. <hi>Coxe</hi> upon <hi>Hosea:</hi> 4. 4. preached a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <note place="margin">Exeter.</note> to prove that the Church of <hi>England</hi> did not maintain the Calling of Bishops, to be <hi>Jure Divino;</hi> which Sermon troubled those Parts not a little. My Lord the Bishop after he had had Speech with him, sent him to me. When he came, it pleased God so to bless me, that I gave him satisfaction, and he went home very well contented, and made a handsome Retractation voluntarily of himself, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the People.</p>
                     <p>In the skirts of this Diocess in <hi>Shropshire,</hi> there was a Conventicle St. <note place="margin">Asaph.</note>
                        <pb n="564" facs="tcp:54614:294"/>
of mean Persons laid hold on, and Complaint was made to the Council of the Marches. And the Lord President of <hi>Wales</hi> very Honourably gave notice of it, both to the Lords and my self; <note place="margin">Bath and Wells. Sarum. Worcester. Gloucester. Rochester. St. <hi>Davids.</hi> Landaff. Bangor.</note> and they were remitted to receive such Censure, as the Laws Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical impose upon them.</p>
                     <p>These Bishops do all Certifie, that every thing is well in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Diocesses, concerning the Particulars contained in your Majesty's Instructions, and otherwise.</p>
                     <p>The like is Certified by the Lord Bishop of <hi>Chichester,</hi> saving that of late there hath hapned some little disorder in the <hi>East</hi> parts of that <note place="margin">Chichester.</note> Diocess about <hi>Lewis,</hi> which we are taking care to settle as well as we can. And for Non-Conformists, he saith, that Diocess is not so much troubled with <hi>Puritan</hi> Ministers, as with <hi>Puritan</hi> Justices of the Peace, of which latter there are store.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>And so with my Prayers for your Majesty's long and happy Reign, I humbly submit this my Account. <hi>January</hi> 2. 1639. <note place="margin">
                              <hi>C. R.</hi> I hope it is to be understood, that what is not certified here to be amisse, is right, touching the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of my Instructions, which granted, this is no ill Certificat. <hi>10:</hi> Feb. <hi>1617/40. C. R.</hi>

                  <p>WHen I wrote the Preface to this first Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, I had intended to reserve what follows, as well as the immediately preceding Papers <hi>(viz:</hi> the Arch-Bishop's Annual Accounts of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince) for the Second Volume; as not believing there would be any room for them in this. But the Book having now fallen much short of the number of Sheets, by me at first computed; I have thought fit to cause these Memorials to be here adjoyned, that so this Volume might be thereby increased to a convenient Bulk. I made choice of these, rather than any other Papers for this purpose; because they contribute very much to the more perfect knowledge of the great Transactions of those Times, both in Church and State; and do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed constitute a part of the History of the Life and Actions of the Arch-Bishop, and are often referred to by him in the preceding <hi>History.</hi> The Original Accounts of the Arch-Bishop to the King concerning his Province, Apostilled in the Margin with the King's own Hand, are now in my Custody. The Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts indeed are not wrote in the Arch-Bishop's own Hand (that being not thought fair enough by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, to be presented to the King's view upon that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) but very fairly wrote by his Secretary, or some other employed by him. But the Notes or Apostils,
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:54614:295"/>
added by the King to them, and therewith remitted to the Arch-Bishop, are wrote in the King's own Hand; which is fair enough, although the Orthography be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious (a matter common to many Learned Men of that time, and even to the Arch-Bishop himself) which yet however I have caused to be retained; as having obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Arch-Bishop had caused the King's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thography to be Literally followed in those Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts, which he ordered his Secretary and Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strary to make of them; either to be kept for his own use, or to be inserted in his Publick Register.</p>

                  <p>IF there be any professing the Protestant Religion within the King's Dominions, or elsewhere, who are yet so wilfully blinded as not to discern, so sottishly incredulous as not to believe, any real long-prosecuted Conspiracy, by former secret Practices and the present Wars to extirpate the Protestant Religion, re-establish Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and inthrall the People in all three Kingdoms, notwithstanding all visible effects, and transparent demonstrations of it, lively set forth in the late <hi>Declaration of the Lords and Commons, concerning the Rise and Progress of the Grand Rebellion in Ireland,</hi> and other <hi>Remonstran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of that nature; let them now advisedly fix their Eyes, Minds, upon the ensuing <hi>Letters</hi> and <hi>Discoveries,</hi> (seised on by Master <hi>Prynn,</hi> in the <hi>Arch-Bishop's Chamber</hi> in the <hi>Tower, May</hi> 31. 1643. by Warrant from the <hi>close Committee,</hi> unexpectedly commanded on that service) and then they must needs acknowledge it an indubitable verity; [Since Sir <hi>William Boswell,</hi> the Arch-Bishop,] and those who revealed this Plot, were perswaded [of its reality upon the first <hi>Discovery,</hi>] be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it brake forth openly in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who and what the Author of this <hi>Discovery</hi> was; who the chief active Instruments in the Plot; when, and where they assembled; in what vigorous manner they daily prosecuted it; how effectually they proceeded in it; how difficult it is to dissolve or counterwork it, without special diligence, the Relation it self will best discover. Whose verity if any question, these Reasons will inforce belief:</p>
                  <p>First, That the Discoverer was a chief Actor in this Plot, sent hither from <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Cardinal Barbarino;</hi> to assist <hi>Con</hi> the Pope's Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate in the pursuit of it, and privy to all the particulars therein discovered.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the horrour and reality of the Conspiracy so troubled his Conscience, <note n="*" place="bottom">And would be then disclose it to me, if I were in any degree a Promoter of it, or a Favourer of the Religion:</note> [as it ingaged him to disclose it,] yea to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that bloody Church and Religion, which contrived it; though bred up in, preferred by it, and promised greater advancements for his diligence in this Design.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That he discovered it under an Oath of Secresie, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to confirm every particular by solemn Oath.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That he discovers the Persons principally imployed in this Plot, the places and times of their secret Conventions, their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and diligence in the pursuit of it, with all other Circumstances so punctually, as leaves no place for doubt.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The principal Conspirators nominated by him are notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously known to be fit instruments for such a wicked design.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Many particulars therein have [immediate relation to the King and Arch-Bishop,] to whom he imparted this Discovery, and
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:54614:297"/>
durst not reveal any thing for Truth, which they could disprove on their own knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Sir <hi>William Boswell,</hi> [and the Arch-Bishop,] if not the King himself, were fully satisfied, that it was real and most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, Some particulars [are ratified by the Arch-Bishop's Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, in the Memorials of his own Life,] written with his own Hand some Years before; and others so apparent, that most intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Men in Court or City, were acquainted with them whiles they were acting, though ignorant of the Plot.</p>
                  <p>Finally, The late sad effects of this Conspiracy in all three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, in prosecution of this design, compared with it, are such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Evidence of its reality; and God's admirable hand of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in bringing this concealed Plot so seasonably to light, <note n="*" place="bottom">This is not so. For I gave not any Vote at all for his Censure.</note> [by an instrument unexpectedly rarsed from the Grave of Exile and Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, to search the Arch-Bishop's Papers, who had seised his in former times, and shut him up close Prisoner in a Foreign Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on] such a Testimony from Heaven super-added to the premises, that he who deems it an Imposture, may well be reputed an <hi>

                     <p>For as I may believe these Overtures are verifiable in the way they will be layed; and that the parties will not shrink: So I make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, That if never so little a glimpse, or shadow of these Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions shall appear by his Majesty's, or your Grace's Speech or Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, unto others, the means whereby the business may be brought best unto Tryal, will be utterly disappointed: And the parties, who have in Conserence towards God, and Devotion to his Majesty, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to your Grace, and Compassion of our Country, disclosed these things, will run a present and extream Hazard of their Persons and Lives. So easily it will be conjectured (upon the least occasion given upon his Majesty's or your Grace's parts) who is the Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer; by what means, and how he knows so much of these things; and where he is. These are the Points, which together with the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, they have presfed me especially to represent most seriously unto your Grace.</p>
                     <p>For my own paticular, having most humbly craved pardon of any Error or Omissions, that have befallen me in the managing of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, I do beseech your Grace to let me know;</p>
                     <p>First, Whether, and in what order I shall proceed hereafter with the Parties?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, What Points of these Offers I shall chiefly, and first put them to enlarge and clear?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="572" facs="tcp:54614:298"/>
Thirdly, What other Points and enquiries I shall propose unto them, and in what manner?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, How far farther I shall suffer my self to hear and know these things?</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Whether I shall not rather take the parties Answers and Discoveries sealed up by themselves; and having likewise put my own Seal upon them, without questioning or seeing what they contain, so transmit them to his Majesty or your Grace?</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Whether I may not insinuate upon some fair occasion, That there will be a due Regard held of them and their Service, by his Majesty and your Grace: When all particulars undertaken in these general offers, and necessary for perfecting the discovery and work intended, shall be effectually deliver'd to his Majesty or your Grace?</p>
                     <p>Upon these Heads, and such other as his Majesty or your Grace shall think proper in the business, I must with all Humility beseech your Grace to furnish me with Instructions, and Warrant for my proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, under his Majesty's Hand with your Grace's Attestation, as by his Majesty's Goodness and Royal Disposition is usual in like Cases.</p>
                     <p>May it please your Grace to entertain a Cypher with me upon this Occasion. I have sent the Counterpart of one here inclosed: In the vacant spaces whereof your Grace may insert such Names more, with numbers to them, as you think requisite.</p>
                     <p>If these Overtures happily sort with his Majesty's and your Grace's Mind, and shall accordingly prove effectual in their Operation, I shall think my self a most Happy Man, to have had my Oblation in so Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Work for my most Gracious Sovereign and Master: More parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, in that your Grace, under his Majesty, shall be <hi>Opifex re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum &amp; Mundi melioris origo.</hi> Which I shall incessantly beg in my Prayers at his Hands, who is the giver of all good things; and will never forsake or fail them, who do not first fail and fall from him, the God of Mercy and Peace. With which I remain evermore,</p>
                     <p>I have not dared to trust this Business (without a Cypher) but by a sure Hand; for which I have sent this Bearer, my Secretary, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press: But he knoweth nothing of the Contents hereof.</p>

                              <p>ALL my Senses are shaken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as often as I revolve the present business; neither doth my Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding suffice (to conceive) what Wind hath brought such horridthings, that they should see the Sunshine by me. For besides expectation this good Man became known unto me, who when he had heard me discoursing of these Scottish stirs, said, that I knew not the Nerve of the Business, that those things which are commonly scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered abroad are Superficial: From that hour he every day became more familiar to me; who acknowledging my dexterity herein, with a full Brest poured forth the Burdens of his Heart into my Bosom, supposing that he had discharged a Burthen of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science wherewith he was pressed. Hence he related to me the Factions of the Jesuits, with which the whole Earthly World was assaulted, and shewed, that I might behold how through their Poyson, Bohemia and Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many were devoured, and both of them maimed with an irreparable Wound: That the same Plague did creep through the Realms of England and Scotland, the matter whereof reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the adjacent writing, be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to me: Which things having heard, <note n="*" place="margin">If a stranger were thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected at the hearing of this Plot, how should we our selves be sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thereof?</note> my Bowels were contracted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, my Loyns trembled with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that a pernicious Gulf should be prepared for so many thousands of Souls: With Words moving the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, I inflamed the Mind of the Man: He had scarce one hour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted my Admonitions, but he disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:54614:299"/>
all the Secrets, and he gave free Liberty that I should treat with those whom it concerned, that they might be informed thereof. I thought no delay was to be made about the things? The same Hour I went to Master Boswell the King's Leger at the Hague, who being tied with an Oath of Secrecy to me, I communicated the Business to him; I admonished him to weigh these things by the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, neither to defer, but act, that those who were in danger might be speedily succoured: He, as becomes an honest man, mindful of his Duty, and having nearer looked into the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, refused not to obey the moniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Moreover, he forthwith cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that an Express should be dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and sent word back again, what a most acceptable Oblation this had been to the King and your Grace; for which we rejoyced from the Heart, and we judged, that a safe and favourable Deity had interposed it self in this Business, whereby you might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
                              <p>Now that the verity of the things related might be confirmed, some prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal heads of the Conspiracy were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely pretermitted, that the Knowledge of them might be extorted from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvented Society of the Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
                              <p>Now the things will be speedily and safely promoted into Act, if they be warily proceeded in at Bruxels. By my advice, that day should be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved wherein the Packet of Letters are dispatched, which under the Title of, To Monsieur Strario Arch-Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con of Cambray, tied with one Cover are delivered to the Post-Master, such a Packet may be secretly brought back from him; yet it will be unprofitable, because all the inclosed Letters are written Characteristically. Likewise another Packet coming weekly from Rome, which is brought under this Subscription, to the Most Illustrious Lord Count Rossetti, Legat for the
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:54614:299"/>
time; these are not to be neglected: to whom likewise Letters writ in the same Character are included. That they may be understood, <hi>Read</hi> is to be consulted with. The forenamed day of dispatch shall be expected: In <hi>Read's</hi> house an accumulated Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation may be circumvented; which succeeding, it will be your Grace's part to order the Business. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testine Enemy being at length detected by God's Grace, all Bitterness of Mind which is caused on either side may be abolished, delivered to oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, deleted and quieted, the Enemy be invaded on both parts: Thus the King and the King's Friend, and both Kingdoms near to danger, shall be preserved, delivered from immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Danger.</p>
                              <p>Your Grace likewise may have this Injunction by you, if you desire to have the best advice given you by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>that you trust not overmuch to your Pursevants; for some of them live under the Stipend of the Popish party.</hi> How many Rocks, how many Scillaes, how many displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Charibdes appear before your Grace, in what a dangerous Sea the Cockboat of your Grace's Life, next to Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, is tossed, your self may judge; the Fore-deck of the Ship is speedily to be driven to the Harbour.</p>
                              <p>All these things (I whisper) into your Grace's Ear; for I know it bound with an Oath of Secresie; therefore by open Name, I would by these Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents become known unto your Grace.</p>

First, because I am no way able to make haste enough with it. Secondly, because should I come at this time, and antedate the meeting <hi>Septemb.</hi> 24. there would be more jealousy of the Business, and more enquiry after it; especially, if I being once there, should return again befor that Day, as I must if this be followed, as is most fit.</p>
                           <p>The danger it seems is imminent, and laid by God knows whom; but to be executed by them which are very near about you. (For the great Honour which I have to be in danger with you, or for you, I pass not, so your Sacred person and the State may be safe.)

                           <p>The Business (if it be) is extream foul. The discovery thus by God's Providence offered, seems fair.

And if you please to return it herewith presently to me, I will send an Express away with it presently.</p>
                           <p>In the mean time, I have by this Express returned him this Answer, <note place="margin">I like your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer extreame well, and doe promise not to deceive your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, nor make you break your word.</note> That I think he shall do well to hold on the Treaty with these Men, with all Care and Secresy, and drive on to the Discovery, so soon as the Business is ripe for it, that he may assure himself and them, they shall not want reward, if they do the Service.

                     </head>
                     <p>THE Relation of this horrid Plot by a chief Actor in it, (with which the Arch-Bishop acquainted the King, not many Days before this Parliament began) lay concealed among the Arch-Bishop's Papers, <note n="a" place="bottom">I did all I could; and the whole Business was examined at a Committee of Lords, his Majesty being present. And Sir <hi>William Roswell's</hi> last Answer to these Lords Committees came after I was committed, when it lay not in my Power to follow it any farther.</note> [without any Prosecution of the Conspirators (for ought appears) who are since dispersed in part by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment] but neither Dissolved, nor taken off this Plot, but more active in it; putting forth their last and utmost Endeavours in all Places to accomplish this their Design, which they have almost brought to Maturity, to our Shame and Grief, by new raised Civil Wars both in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Two things in this Plot which concern [the Arch-Bishop] may perchance seem strange to different sorts of Men.</p>
                     <p>First, <hi>That [the Pope's Legat should presume to tempt the Arch-Bishop with the Offer of a Cardinal's Cap,]</hi> and that certainly no such Proffer was ever made unto him. But to put this out of Question: The Bishop himself, under his own Hand, among other Memorials in the Journal of his Life, (found in his Pocket) hath these two remarkable Notes, <hi>Anno</hi> 1633. <hi>August</hi> 4. <hi>Sunday, News came to Court of the Lord Arch-Bishop of</hi> Canterbury's <hi>Death, and the King resolved presently to give it me.

                           </gap>, or one employed from him.</note> ABILITY TO PERFORM IT, and OFFERED ME TO BE A CARDINAL. <hi>I went presently</hi> TO THE KING and ACQUAINTED HIM BOTH [WITH THE THING and PERSON.] <hi>August</hi> 17. (the same Month) <hi>Saturday I had</hi> A SERIOUS OFFER MADE ME AGAIN TO BE A CAR-DINAL. <hi>I was then from Court; but so soon as I came thither (which was</hi> Wednesday, August 21.) I ACQUAINTED HIS MAJESTY WITH IT. <hi>But my Answer again was, That somewhat dwelt within me that would not suffer that</hi> TILL ROME <hi>were other than it is.</hi> So that by his own Notes it appears, a Cardinal's Cap was twice proffered him <hi>very seriously,</hi> and that he acquainted the King with it; <note n="b" place="bottom">Yet, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The very Parties that tendred this Cap, <note n="h" place="bottom">The slanderous Tongues of your Faction made him presume, if any thing.</note> [presuming some good Inclination in him to accept it] and to the Romish Church, which he maintains to be a True Church, wherein Men are, and may be saved: And the Second Proffer fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing so soon at the Heels of the First, intimates, That the First was in such sort entertained by him, as rather encouraged, than discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the Party to make the Second. And his Second Consultation with the King concerning it, insinuates, That [the King rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to, than against it;] or at leastwise left it arbitrary to him, to accept or reject it, as he best liked. As for his Severity in prosecuting Papists, it appears by his Epistle to the King before his Conference with the Jesuit <hi>Fisher,</hi> where he useth these Speeches of his Carriage towards them; <hi>God forbid that I should perswade a Persecution in any kind, or practise it in the least</hi> 
                        <note n="i" place="bottom">These Words are not mine. Besides, take the whole Sentence; and then, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>[against Priests and Jesuits.] For to my remembrance I have not given him or his so much as cross Language. Therefore he is no great Enemy to them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Second thing which may seem strange to others, is this; <hi>That the Pope's Legat and Jesuits should ever hate, or conspire his Death, unless he were an utter Enemy to all Popery, Papists, and the Church of</hi> Rome; which admits an easie Answer. The Truth is, the Bishop being very pragmatical and wilful in his Courses, could not well brook pragmatical peremptory Jesuits, who in Popish Kingdoms are in perpetual Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with all other Orders, and they with them; they having been oft banished out of <note n="*" place="margin">See the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Hist. of <hi>France</hi> in the Life of H. 3. &amp; 4.</note>

                     <p>FRom the Relation of the former Plot by so good a Hand, our own Three Realms, and all Foreign Protestant States may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive full Satisfaction.</p>
                     <p>First, That there hath been a most cunning, strong, execrable Conspiracy long since contrived at <hi>Rome,</hi> and for divers Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther most vigorously pursued in <hi>England</hi> with all Industry, Policy, Subtilty, Engines, by many active, potent Confederates of all sorts, all Sexes, to undermine the Protestant Religion, re-establish Popery, and alter the very Frame of Civil Government in all the King's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; wherein a most dangerous visible Progress hath been lately made.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That to effect this Trayterous Design, they have not only secretly erected some Monasteries of <hi>Monks, Nuns,</hi> in, and about <hi>London;</hi> but sent over hither whole Regiments of most active subtile Jesuits, incorporated into a particular new Society, whereof the Pope himself is Head, and Cardinal <hi>Barbarino</hi> his Vicar; which Society was first discovered, and some of them apprehended in their private College at <hi>Clerkenwel</hi> (together with their Books of Account, Reliques, and Massing Trinkets) about the beginning of the Second Parliament of this King; yet such Power, Favour, Friends they had then acquired, that their Persons were speedily and most indirectly released out of <hi>Newgate</hi> without any Prosecution, to prevent the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament's Proceedings against them. Since which, this conjured So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety increasing in Strength and Number, secretly replanted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:54614:312"/>
in <hi>Queenstreet</hi> and <hi>Long-Acre;</hi> and their Purses are now so strong, their Hopes so elevated, their Designs so ripened, as they have there purchased, and founded [a new magnificent College] of their own for their Habitation, near the fairest Buildings of Nobles, Knights and Gentlemen, the more commodiously to seduce them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That these Jesuits and Conspirators hold weekly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, uninterrupted Intelligence with the Pope and Romish Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals; and have many Spies or Intelligencers of all sorts about the King, Court, City, Noblemen, Ladies, Gentlemen, and in all Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Kingdom, to promote this their Damnable Plot.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That the Pope for divers late Years hath had a known avowed <hi>Legat, Con</hi> by Name, openly residing even in <hi>London</hi> near the Court, of purpose to reduce the King and his Kingdoms to the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the <hi>Queen</hi> at least, another <hi>Leger</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> trading with the Pope, to facilitate the Design, to wit, one <hi>Hamilton</hi> a Scot, who receives a large Pension out of the Exchequer, granted to another Protestant of that Name, who payeth it over unto him, to palliate the business from the People's knowledge; by which means there hath been a constant allowed Negotiation held between <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> without any open interruption.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, That the Pope's Legat came over into <hi>England</hi> to effect this Project, and kept his Residence here in <hi>London,</hi> for the better Prosecution thereof, by the King's own Privity and Consent. And whereas by <note n="*" place="margin">

Pope's Legat extant in <hi>England</hi> before this in Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> Reign, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled her and the Realm to</hi> Rome, <hi>to their intolerable Prejudice.</hi> An [Act so inconsistent with the Laws of the Realm, with his Majesty's many ancient and late <hi>Remonstrances, Oaths, Protestations to maintain the</hi>] <hi>Protestant Religion, without giving way to any back-sliding to Popery, in such sort as it was maintained and professed in the purest Times of Queen</hi> Elizabeth, &amp;c. as may well amaze the World, which ever looks more at real Actions than verbal Protestations.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, That the Popish Party and Conspirators have lately usurped a Sovereign Power, not only above the Laws and Magistrates of the Realm (which take no hold of Papists, but by the Parliament's late Care against them here) but even over the King himself; who either cannot, or dares not (for fear, perchance, of Poysoning, or other Assassination) oppose or banish these horrid Conspirators from his Dominions and Court, but hath a long time permitted them to prosecute this <hi>Plot</hi> without any publick Opposition or Dislike, by whose Powerful Authority and Mediation all may easily divine. Alas! What will become of the poor Sheep, when the Shepherd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self not only neglects to chase and keep out these Romish Wolves, but permits them free Access into, and Harbour in the Sheepfold, to assault, if not devour, not only his Flock, but Person too? Either St. <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 10. 10, 11, 12, 13.</note> 
                        <hi>John</hi> was much mistaken in the Character of a <hi>good Shepherd,</hi> and in prescribing this Injunction against such Seducers, <note n="†" place="margin">2 Joh. 10, 11.</note> 
                        <hi>If there come any unto you, and bring not this Doctrine, receive him not into your House, neither bid him God speed: for he that biddeth him God speed, is Partaker of his evil Deeds.</hi> And the <note n="*" place="margin">Gratian. caus. <hi>23.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Seventhly, That these Conspirators are so potent, as to remove from Court and Publick Offices all such as dare strenuously oppose their Plots, [(as the Example of <note n="a" place="bottom">Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> wrought him out.</note> Secretary <hi>Cook,</hi> with other] Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers lately removed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> evidence) and plant others of their own Party and Confederacy both in his Majesty's Court, Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, Closet, Bed-chamber, [if not Bed,] and about the Prince, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt them: And how those who are thus environed with so many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious potent Seducers of all sorts, who have so many Snares to entrap, so many Enticements to withdraw them, both in their Beds, Bed-Chambers, Closets, Councils, Courts, where-ever they go or come, should possibly continue long untainted, unseduced, without an omnipotent Protection (of which none can be assured, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits or connives at such dangerous Temptations) is a thing scarce credible in Divine or Humane Reason, if <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 3.</note>

                     <p>Eighthly, That the late Scottish Trouble and Wars were both plotted and raised by these Jesuitical Conspirators, of purpose to force the King to resort to them and their Popish Party for Aid of Men and Money against the <hi>Scots;</hi> and by Colour thereof, to raise an Army
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:54614:313"/>
of their own, to gain the King into their Power, and then to win or force him to what Conditions they pleased; who must at least-wise promise them an universal Toleration of their Religion throughout his Dominions, e're they will yield to assist him. And in case they conquer or prevail, he must then come fully over to their Party, or else be sent packing by them with a poysoned Fig to another World, [as his Father (they say) was;] (it's likely by their Instruments or Procurement, they are so conusant of it;) and then [the Prince yet young, and well enclined to them already by his Education] being got into their Hands by this wicked Policy, shall soon be made an Obedient Son of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Thus the Relator, a chief Actor in this pre-plotted Treason, discovers. And if his single Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony (though out of a wounded Conscience) will not be believed alone, the ensuing Circumstances will abundantly manifest the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Wars to be plotted and directed by them: For <hi>Con</hi> the Pope's Legat, <hi>Hamilton</hi> the Queen's Agent, most of the Jesuits then about <hi>London,</hi> Captain <hi>Read</hi> their Host, the Lord <hi>Sterling,</hi> with other <note n="*" place="margin">Chamberlain, <hi>Cardinal</hi> Richelieu <hi>his Agent.</hi>
                        </note> chief Actors in the Plot, being all <hi>Scots,</hi> and employing <hi>Maxfield,</hi> and he two other Popish <hi>Scots,</hi> in raising these Tumults; the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> [another principal Member of this Conspiracy, being by their procurement made General of the first Army against the <hi>Scots,</hi>] and most of his Commanders Papists; the Papists in all Counties of <hi>England</hi> (upon the Queen's Letters directed to them) contributing large Sums of Money, besides Men, Arms and Horses, to maintain this War. Sir <hi>Toby Matthew</hi> (the most Industrious Conspirator in the Pack) making a Voyage with the Lord Deputy into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to stir up the Papists there to contribute Men, Arms, Moneys, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the Scottish Covenanters; [yea, Marquess <hi>Hamilton's</hi> own Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain] (employed as the King's Commissioner to appease these <hi>Scots</hi>) [holding Correspondency with <hi>Con,</hi> and resorting to him] in private, to impart the Secrets of that business to him, the general Discontent of the Papists and Conspirators upon the first Pacification of those Troubles, which they soon after infringed, and by new Contributions raised a second Army against the <hi>Scots,</hi> when the English Parliament refused to grant Subsidies to maintain the War. All these concurring Circumstances compared with the Relation, will ratifie it past Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute, that this War first sprung from these Conspirators.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, That the subsequent present Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Wars in <hi>England,</hi> originally issued from, and were plotted by the same Conspirators. For the Scottish War producing this setled Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, beyond their expectation, which they foresaw would prove fatal to this their long-agitated Conspiracy, if it continued undissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; thereupon some Popish Irish Commissioners coming over into <hi>England,</hi> and confederating with the Dutchess of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> [Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Read</hi>

there by the Parliament's Forces sent hence, and from <hi>Scotland,</hi> to relieve the Protestant Party; thereupon to work a Diversion, they raised a Civil Bloody War against the Parliament here in <hi>England,</hi> procuring the King [after <hi>Endymion Porter,</hi> a principal Conspirator in the Plot, had gained the Custody of the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi>] to issue out divers Proclamations under the great Seal, proclaiming the <hi>Parliament themselves Traytors and Rebels, to grant Commissions</hi> to Irish and English Papists (contrary to his former Proclamations) to raise Popish Forces both at Home and in Foreign parts, for his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as his trustiest and most loyal Subjects; to send Letters and Commissions of Favour to the Irish Rebels, and hinder all Supplies from hence to the Protestant Party. And withal they procured [the Queen,] by the Earl of <hi>Antrim</hi> and Dutchess of <hi>Buckingham's</hi> Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, [to send Ammunition to the Irish Rebels,] and to attempt to raise an Insurrection in <hi>Scotland</hi> too, as the <hi>Declaration of the Rise and Progress of the Rebellion in</hi> Ireland, more largely discovers. Seeing then all may clearly discern the exact Prosecution of this Plot, carried on in all these Wars by the Conspirators therein particularly nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, by the Queen and Popish Party in all Three Kingdoms, and in Foreign Parts too, who have largely contributed Men, Money, Arms, Ammunition, to accomplish this Grand Design, through the Instigation of those Conspirators in this Plot, who are gone beyond the Seas, and have lately caused publick Proclamations to be made in <hi>Bruges,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Flanders,</hi> in <hi>July</hi> last, (as appears by the Examination of <hi>Henry Mayo,</hi> since seconded by others, <hi>That all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who will now give</hi> ANY MONEY TO MAINTAIN THE RO-MAN CATHOLICKS IN ENGLAND, <hi>should have it repaid them again in a Years time, with many Thanks;</hi>) the whole World must now of Necessity both see and acknowledge (unless they will renounce their own Eyes and Reason) that this Conspiracy and Plot is no feigned Imposture, but a most real perspicuous agitated Treachery, now driven on almost to its Perfection, the full Accomplishment whereof (unless Heaven prevent it) the Catholicks of <hi>England</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect within the Circuit of one Year, as the forenamed Proclamations intimate.</p>
                     <p>Tenthly, That no setled Peace [was ever formerly intended, nor can now] be futurely expected in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi> without an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal publick Toleration (at the least) of [Popery, and a Repeal and Suspension of all Laws against it;] this being the very Condition in the Plot which the King must condescend to, e're the Papists would engage themselves to assist him in these Wars thus raised by them, for this end. And that none may doubt this Verity, the late most insolent bold Demands of the Irish Rebels in the Treaty with them, the present Suspension of all Laws against Priests and Recusants in all Counties under his Majesty's Power; [the uncontrolled multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Masses in his Armies, Quarters, <hi>Wales,</hi> the North, and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where;] the open Boasts of Papists every where, most really pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim it. And if the King, after all their many Years restless La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, Plot, Costs, Pains, and pretended Fidelity to his Cause against the Parliament, should deny these <hi>Merit-mongers</hi> such a diminutive Reward as this is, (the very least they will expect) now they have

The execrable Horrridness and Reality whereof, made the very Discoverer of the <hi>Plot,</hi> out of remorse of Conscience, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert the Conspirators Conspiracy, and that bloody Religion which begot it; and therefore should much more incite [all such in his Majesty's Army] who are cordially faithful to their Sovereign, Religion, Country, Posterity, and have hitherto ignorantly acted these Conspirators Treasonable Designs, under colour of serving the King, to consider with remorse of Conscience, whose In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments they have thus long been, whose Treasons they have ripened, what Protestant Blood they have shed, how much they have weakened, impoverished, betrayed their own Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Party, who have really stood for God, Religion, King, Country, Parliament, against these <hi>Romish</hi> Conspirators; and what Hopes, what Advantages they have given these Confederates both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to over-top, suppress, and ere long utterly to extirpate the Protestant Religion, themselves, and all others who cordially profess it, as they have done many thousands of them already. And then upon all these sad, most serious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations (the very Thoughts whereof should cause their Souls to bleed and tremble) speedily to desert these traiterous Papists, ere they get all into their Power, [and unite all their Heads, Hearts,
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:54614:314" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Hands, Forces, to the Parliament's Party] who had so good cause to take up defensive Arms, to prevent the imminent ruin, which otherwise is like to befal both King, Kingdom, Religion, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Liberty, Property, Posterity, ere we be aware; [especially since the most cowardly unworthy yielding up of <hi>Bristol,</hi> a fit In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let for the <hi>Irish</hi> Rebels] who have conspired to come over hither with all expedition, and [<hi>Welsh</hi> Papists to cut all our Throats.]</p>
                     <p>Eleventhly, That those Protestants who now side with Popish Conspirators, when they have accomplished their Designs, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may now fancy to themselves, shall find no more Mercy or Favour from them, than the greatest Roundheads, if they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply not with them in all things, and even in Popery it self: For if they will not spare the King's own Person and Life, after so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Favours, Graces, extended to them, (as they will not, if we believe this Relation, or the late Story of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France,</hi> yet fresh in memory) what inferiour Person can think to be secure to fare better than the King himself? And if <hi>Con</hi> the Legat, to insinuate himself into the King's and [Palatine's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours] at the first, when he had no interest in them, would not so <hi>much as advise the Legat of</hi> Cologne, <hi>to mediate for the</hi> Palsgrave, <hi>lest peradventure the King of</hi> Spain <hi>should report, that the Pope had Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troniz'd an Heretical Prince, as the Relation attests,</hi> though he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised the King effectually to do it; How [can Prince <hi>Rupert, Maurice,</hi> or any other Commanders in the King's Army, when they have fully accomplished the Pope's, and these his Instruments Designs] (under whose Banner they ignorantly, yet really militate, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his Cause, instead of the King's and Kingdoms, to whom they and others have been so much engaged) hope to receive the least Dram of Favour, Pity, much less any Recompence from the Pope and Popish Party, if they continue Hereticks still, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all their present goodly Promises? Will they part with any other Inheritances to them, then, who will not so much as now mediate for them to regain their own? Will these, who have butchered so many thousands of innocent Protestants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> even before they were sure of the Day, without any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation given, spare any Mother's Son of them alive, if they once erect their Trophies over them? Certainly the Experience of all former Ages, compared with the present, may fully resolve all, That <hi>the very tender Mercies of these wicked ones,</hi> will be nought <hi>but extream Cruelty;</hi> and if they prevail, we all must perish, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out distinction, sooner or later, unless we will turn Apostates, and lose our Religion, God, Heaven, Souls, to save our transitory Lives.</p>
                     <p>Finally, Therefore let the serious Consideration of all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises instruct us, to learn Wisdom from these our Adversaries; let their indefatigable Industry, subtil Policy, sincere Fidelity, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Constancy, bountiful Liberality, fraternal Unanimity, undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Magnanimity, indissolvable Confederacy, and uninterrupted Pertinacy in prosecuting, establishing, propagating their Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religions, Treasons, Designs, excite all Protestants [(accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their several late <hi>Covenants</hi> and <hi>Protestations</hi> much forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten)]

to equalize, if not transcend them in all these, in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, securing, propagating our true Christian Religion, protecting our King, Kingdoms, Parliament, Laws, Liberties, Posterities, all we yet have, or hereafter hope for, from that imminent ruin, which these Popish Conspirators threaten to them. Fore-warn'd, fore-arm'd: If now we perish through our own private Dissentions, Folly, Cowardise, Covetousness, Treachery, or Security, or [monstrous Credulity] that these Conspirators and Papists now in Arms, fight only for the King and establishment of the Protestant Religion, as it was in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> days, against whom they plotted so many Treasons, even for her very Religion, and the Powder-Plot since, against King <hi>James</hi> and the whole Parliament; our Blood shall rest upon our own Heads, who would not take timely notice of our incumbent Dangers, nor suddenly prevent them whiles we might.</p>

For you begin, that my Lord Ambassador told you, I was not pleased to hear you had made a Defection from the Church of <hi>England.</hi> 'Tis most true, I was informed so; and thereupon I writ to my Lord Ambassador, to know what he heard of it there. But 'tis true likewise, that I writ to your self; and Mr. Secretary <hi>Cooke</hi> sent my Letters very carefully. Now seeing your Letters mentioned my Lord Ambassador's Speech with you, without any notice taken of my writing; I could not but fear these Letters of mine came not to your Hands. Out of this Fear, your Second Letters took me; for they acknowledged the receipt of mine, and your kind acceptance of them. Had they miscarried, I should have held it a great Misfortune. For you must needs have condemned me deeply in your own Thoughts, if in such a near and tender Business, I should have solicited my Lord Ambassador, and not written to your self.</p>
                        <p>In the next place I thank you, and take it for a great Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of your Love to me; that you have been pleased to give me so open and clear Account of your proceedings with your self in this matter of Religion. In which as I cannot but commend the strict reckoning, to which you have called your self; so I could have wish'd, before you had absolutely setled the Foot of that Account, you would have called in some Friend, and made use of his Eye as a By-stander, who oftentimes sees more than he that plays the
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:54614:317"/>
Game. You write, I confess, that after you had fallen upon these troublesom Thoughts, you were nigh two Years in the diligent Discussion of this matter; and that you omitted no Industry, either of conversing with Learned Men, or of reading the best Authors, to beget in you a right Intelligence of this Subject. I believe all this, and you did wisely to do it. But I have some Questions, out of the freedom of a Friend, to ask about it. Were not all the Learned Men, you conversed with for this Particular, of the <hi>Roman</hi> Party? Were not the best Authors, you mention, of the same Side? If both Men and Authors were the same way; can they beget any righter Intelligence in you, than is in themselves? If they were Men and Authors on both Sides, with whom you conversed; why was I (whom you are pleased to Style one of your best Friends) omitted? True, it may be, you could not reckon me among those Learned Men and Able for Direction, with whom you conversed: Suppose that; yet your self accounts me among your Friends. And is it not many times as useful, when Thoughts are distracted, to make use of the Freedom and Openness of a Friend not altogether Ignorant, as of those which are thought more Learned; but not so Free, nor perhaps so Indifferent?</p>
                        <p>But the Result, you say, that first-began to settle you, was, that you discern'd by this your diligent Conversation, and studious Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that there were great Mistakings on both Sides, and that Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Affection to a Party, transported too many of those that entred into the Lists in this Quarrel. Suppose this also to be true, I am heartily sorry, and have been ever since I was of any Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in matters of Religion, to hear of Sides in the Church. And I make no doubt, but 'twill one Day fall heavy upon all, that wilfully make, or purposely continue Sidings in that Body. But when Sides are made and continued, remember you confess there are great Mistakings on both Sides. And how then can you go from one Side to the other; but you must go from one great Mistaking to another? And if so, then by changing the Side, you do but change the Mistaking, not quit your self from Mistakes. And if you do quit your self from them, by God's Goodness, and your own Strength; yet why might not that have been done, without changing the Side; since Mistakes are on both Sides? As for the Passion and Transportation of many that enter the Lists in this Quarrel; I am sure you mean not to make their Passion your Guide; for that would make you mistake indeed. And why then should their Passion work upon your Judgment? especially, since the Passion, as well as the Mistakes are confest to be on both Sides.</p>
                        <p>After this follows the main part of your Letters, and that which principally resolved you to enter again the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in which you had been Born and Bred, against that semblance of good Reason, which formerly had made you adhere to the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And first you say, you now perceive that you may preserve your self in that Church, without having your Belief bound up in several particulars, the dislike whereof had been a motive to you to free your
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:54614:318"/>
self from the Jurisdiction which you conceived did impose them. 'Tis true, all Churches leave some particulars free. But doth that Church leave you free to believe, or not believe, any thing deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by it? And did not your former Dislike arise from some things determined in and by that Church? And if so, what Freedom see you now, that you saw not then? And you cannot well say, that your Dislike arose from any thing not determined; for in those, the Jurisdiction of that Church imposes not.</p>
                        <p>You add, That your greatest Difficulties were solved, when you could distinguish between the Opinions of some New Men raised upon wrested Inferences, and the plain and solid Articles of Faith delivered at the first. Why, but I cannot but be confident you could distinguish these long since, and long before you joined your self to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And that therefore your greatest Difficulties (if these were they) were as fully and fairly solved then, as now they are, or can be. Besides, if by these plain and solid Articles you mean none but the Creed (and certainly no other were delivered at the first) you seem to intimate by comparing this and the former Passage, that so you believe these plain and first Articles, you may preserve your self in that Church, from having your Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief bound up to other Particulars; which I think few will believe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides your self, if you can believe it. And the Opinions of New Men, and the wrested Inferences upon these, are some of those great Mistakes which you say are on both sides, and therefore needed not to have caused your Change.</p>
                        <p>To these first Articles you say, The Church, in no succeeding Age hath power to add (as such) the least Tittle of New Doctrine. Be it so; and I believe it heartily (not as such) especially if you mean the Articles of the Creed. But yet if that Church do maintain, That all her Decisions in a General Council, are Articles <hi>Fidei Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicae;</hi> and that all Christians are bound to believe all and every of them, <hi>eâdem Fide, quâ Fidei Articulos;</hi> and that he is an Heretick which believes them not all: Where is then your Freedom, or your not being bound up in several Particulars? And if you reply, You dislike no Determination which that Church hath made; then why did you formerly leave it, to free your self from that Jurisdiction that you conceived imposed them? For if the things which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled you were Particulars not determin'd, they were not imposed upon your Belief. And if they were determin'd, and so imposed; how are you now set free more than then?</p>
                        <p>You say again, You see now, that to be a Catholick, doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of the fore-named Liberty, who have Abilities to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min the things you formerly stuck at, and drive them up to their first Principles. But first then, what shall become of their Liberty, who are not able to examin; shall they enthral their Consciences? Next, what shall secure them, who think themselves, and are perhaps thought by others able to examin, yet indeed are not? Thirdly, what Assurance is there in Cases not demonstrable (as few things in Religion are) that they which are able to examin, have either no Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to blind their Judgment, or may not mistake themselves and
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:54614:318"/>
their way, in driving a doubtful Point to its First Principles? Lastly, how much doth this differ from leaning upon a private Spirit; so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> cried out against by that side, when Men, under pretence of their Ability, shall examin the Tenets of the Church, and assume a Liberty to themselves, under a colour of not being bound?</p>
                        <p>But, you say, this is not the breaking of any Obligation that Church lays upon you; but only an exact understanding of the just and utmost Obligations that Side ties Men to. I must here question again: For first, what shall become of their Freedom, that cannot reach to this exact understanding? And next, do not you make your self, as a private Man, Judge of the Church's Obligations upon you? And is it not as great an Usurpation upon the Church's Power and Right, to be Judge of her Obligations, as of her Tenets? For if the Points be left free, there's no Obligation: Nor can you, or need any other, have any Scruple. But if the Points be binding by the Predetermination of the Church; can you any way be Judge of her Obligation, but you must be Judge also of the Point to which she obliges? Now, I think, that Church will hardly give liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to any private Man to be so far her Judge, since she scarce al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows so much to any, as <hi>Judicium Discretionis,</hi> in things determin'd by her.</p>
                        <p>These utmost Obligations, to which that Side ties Men, you believe many Men (and not of the meanest Note) pass over in gross, without ever throughly entring into the due Consideration thereof. And truly I believe so too, that among too many Men on both sides, neither the Points nor the Obligations to them, are weighed as they ought. But that's no Warrant (pardon my Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) that your self hath consider'd them in all Circumstances; or that you have consider'd them better now, than you did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when the Dislike of that imposing Jurisdiction, was your first Motive to free your self from it, by joining to the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And whereas you say, That you have return'd into that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, who from your Birth had right of possession in you, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to continue it, unless clear and evident proof (which you say surely cannot be found) should have evicted you from it: Truly, Sir, I think this had been spoken with more advantage to you and your Cause, before your adhering to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than now; for then right of possession could not have been thought little. But now since you deserted that Communion, either you did it upon clear and evident proof, or upon apparent only. If you did it then upon clear and evident proof, why say you now no such can be found? If you did it but upon apparent and seeming proof (a semblance of very good Reason as your self calls it) why did you then come off from that Communion, till your proof were clear and evident? And why may not that, which now seems clear and evident, be but apparent, as well as that which then seem'd clear unto you, be but semblance now? Nor would I have you say, That clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proof cannot be found for a Man, in this case of Religion, to forego the Communion, which had right of possession in him
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:54614:319"/>
from his Birth: For the Proposition is an universal Negative, and of hard proof. And therefore though I think I know you and your Judgment so well, that I may not without manifest wrong charge you, that you did in this great Action, and so nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning you, <hi>ad pauca respicere,</hi> which our Great Master tells us <note place="margin">Ethic. l. <hi>1.</hi>
                           </note> breeds facile and easie, rather than safe and warrantable Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; yet it will lie upon you not only in Honour without, but also in Conscience within, to be able to assure your self that you did <hi>ad plurima,</hi> if not <hi>ad omnia respicere.</hi> The thing being so weighty in it self, and the miserable Division of Christendom (never suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to be lamented) making the Doubt so great, that you who have been on both sides, must needs lie under the Dispute of both sides, whether this last Act of yours, be not in you rather a Relapse into a former Sickness, than a Recovery from a former Fall.</p>
                        <p>But against this, the Temper of your Mind (you say) arms you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>against all Censures, no slight Air of Reputation being able to move you. In this, I must needs say, you are happy: For he that can be moved from himself by the changeable Breath of Men, lives more out of, than in himself; and (which is a Misery beyond all expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) must in all Doubts go to other Men for Resolution; not to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; as if he had no Soul within him: But yet <hi>post Conscientiam Fama.</hi> And though I would not desire to live by Reputation; yet would I leave no good means untried, rather than live without it. And how far you have brought your self in question, which of these two, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science or Reputation, you have shaken by this double Change, I leave your self to judge; because you say your first was with a sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of very good Reason. And though you say again, That it now appears you were then mis-led; yet you will have much ado to make the World think so.</p>
                        <p>The way you took in concealing this your Resolution of returning into that Communion, and the Reasons which you give why you so privately carried it here, I cannot but approve. They are full of all Ingenuity, tender and civil Respects, fitted to avoid Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in your Friends, and Scandal that might be taken by others, or Contumely that might be returned upon your self. And as are these Reasons, so is the whole frame of your Letter (setting aside that I cannot concur in Judgment) full of Discretion and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and so like your self, that I cannot but love even that which I dislike in it. And though I shall never be other than I have been to the Worth of Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby;</hi> yet most heartily sorry I am, that a Man whose Discourse did so much content me, should thus slide away from me, before I had so much as suspicion to awaken me, and suggest that he was going. Had you put me into a Dispensation, and communicated your Thoughts to me before they had grown up into Resolutions, I am a Priest, and would have put on what Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie you should have commanded. A little Knowledge I have (God knows a little) I would have ventur'd it with you in that serious Debate you have had with your self. I have ever honoured you, since I knew your Worth, and I would have done all Offices of a Friend to keep you nearer than now you are. But since you are gone,
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:54614:319"/>
and setled another way, before you would let me know it, I know not now what to say to a Man of Judgment; and so resolved: For to what end should I treat, when a Resolution is set already? So set, as that you say no clear and evident proof can be found against it: Nor can I tell how to press such a Man as you to ring the Changes in Religion. In your power it was not to change; in mine it is not to make you change again. Therefore to the Moderation of your own heart, under the Grace of God, I must and do now leave you for matter of Religion; but retaining still with me, and entirely, all the Love and Friendliness which your Worth won from me; well knowing, that all Differences in Opinion shake not the Foundations of Religion.</p>
                        <p>Now to your <hi>Postscript,</hi> and then I have done. That I am the first, and the only Person to whom you have written thus freely: I thank you heartily for it. For I cannot conceive any thing thereby, but your great Respect to me, which hath abundantly spread it self all over your Letter. And had you written this to me, with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint of making it further known, I should have perform'd that Trust: But since you have submitted it to me, what further Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it I shall think fit to give to any other person; I have, as I took my self bound, acquainted <hi>his Majesty</hi> with it, who gave a great deal of very good Expression concerning you, and is not a little sorry to lose the Service of so able a Subject. I have likewise made it known in private, to Mr. Secretary <hi>Cooke,</hi> who was as confident of you as my self. I could hardly believe your own Letters, and he as hardly my Relation. To my Secretary I must needs trust it, having not Time to write it again out of my scribled Copy; but I dare trust the Secresie in which I have bound him. To others I am silent, and shall so continue, till the thing open it self; and I shall do it out of Reasons, very like to those which you give, why your self would not divulge it here. In the last place, you promise your self, That the Condition you are in, will not hinder me from continuing to be the Best Friend you have. To this I can say no more, than that I could never arrogate to my self to be your Best Friend; but a poor, yet respective Friend of yours I have been, ever since I knew you: And it is not your Change, that can change me, who never yet left, but where I was first forsaken; and not always there. So praying for God's Blessing upon you, and in that Way which He knows most necessary for you, I rest,</p>
