            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT
HONORABLE MY
SINGVLAR AND BEST
Lord, the Earle of Nottingham,
Lord high Admirall of
England.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y dutie to your Lordship hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
remembred. Although the
seruice which I confesse I doe
owe vnto your Lordship in a
manner from my childhood
for many fauors, doth so much
oblige me, as I cannot thinke
how euer it may fall in my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to expresse it: yet cannot I but acknowledge that
those fauours of yours, whereby any publike trust or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
hath been committed to me, doe sit neerest my heart,
and as often as I do thinke of them, doe call me to a stric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
account then any others, which doe onely touch me in
a priuate qualitie: for that in the one, I am onely obliged
to acquite my honesty towards your loue: but in the others
I am bound in a sort to make good your iudgement, and
to iustifie the choise you haue made of me, as a seruant of
the State, for whom your selfe are accountable to her from
<pb facs="tcp:2736:3"/>
whom all power in our State is deriued. The sense which
hereof I haue in the inwardest retraite of my soule, is the
cause I haue thought my dutie both to you, and to the
State not a little interessed, in a report very vulgar in
many mens mouthes in the Citie, and by this time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
spred ouer the Realme. And confirmed by a Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet
printed, contayning a narration of the late seruice
done vpon the Gallies: wherein no mention being made,
neither of my selfe, nor of any of her Maiesties Shippes,
nor of our nation, wee are all secretly touched with some
note, either of negligence of the things committed to vs,
(I specially) or of vnskilfulnes, or of want of courage:
from the staines of all which it importeth me to cleere my
selfe, not onely for mine owne sake, and our nations; but
in some sort for your Lordship, who through my errors
cannot but be wounded, for the ill choise made of me, for
so great a charge: I haue therefore (though against my
nature, which delighteth not to talke of my selfe) been
forced for your Lordship, and all other mens satisfaction,
to expresse in a few lines, a true report of all that was done
in that seruice: which as it is free from affectation of
glorie to my selfe, or of imputation to others; so doe I vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all the dutie I owe, both to your Lordship, and to my
owne reputation, vndertake to make good in euery point
thereof. Beseeching your Lordship notwithstanding, not
to repose your selfe onely vpon mine owne assertions: but
by diligent inquisition (which is not hard for your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to make, hauing so much power ouer the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
that serued with me) throughly to enforme your
selfe of as much as may suffice to satisfie your iudgement:
which if thereby you shall finde confirmed so much as not
to repent you of the trust by your fauour committed vnto
<pb facs="tcp:2736:3"/>
me, it is the vtmost of my desire, weighing otherwise little
what the vulgar conceits of such as either cannot, or will
not thinke aright, shall esteeme of me: if by this true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of my seruice they will not be satisfied. For it is those
that can iudge, whom I desire most to content, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
your Lordship, to whom I doe with as much truth
and synceritie dedicate all other seruices which I
may be able to doe, as I haue vsed in setting
downe this: which I beseech you to
accept as a small testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
thereof.</p>

            <head>A TRVE REPORT OF
THE SERVICE DONE VPON
CERTAINE GALLIES
passing thorough the Narrow
Seas.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N the three and twentie day
of September being in the
<hi>Hope,</hi> and hauing in my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
the <hi>Aduauntage</hi> onely
of the Queenes Ships, which
Captaine <hi>Iones</hi> commanded,
and two other Dutch men
of warre: I ridde more then
halfe Channell ouer, towards the coast of France,
vpon a Northwest and Southest line: my selfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neerest that coast, Captaine <hi>Iones</hi> next vnto
me, and the Dutch men of warre a Sea-boord, and
to the westward of him. The small force at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time
present and with me remaining, thus disposed for
the intercepting of the Gallies, hauing dismist the
Dutch men of warre, that serued vnder me, vpon
their owne intreatie to reuictual and trimme: and
hauing imployed the rest of the Queenes ships
vpon especiall seruices, I descried from my toppe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2736:5"/>
mast heads, sixe lowe sailes, which some made for
Gallies; others affirmed them to be small barkes
that had strooken their top-sailes, being bound
from Deepe towards the Downes. To which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
(though I inclined most) yet caused I the
Maister to waie and to stand with them, that I
might learne some newes of the Gallies, which
by your Lordships aduertisement sent mee, I
knew had either past me that night, or were neere
at hand: vnlesse the Sea had swallowed them vp
in the stormes, which had raged three daies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Hauing set my selfe vnder saile, the weather
waxt thicke, which caused me to lascke some two
poyntes from the winde, towards the English
coast, least the continuance of that darke wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
might giue them power to runne out a head
of me. About eleuen of the clocke the weather
cleared, when I discouered them plainely to be
the Spanish Gallies so long time expected; at
which time with the rest, I plied to receiue them
by crossing their forefoote, as they stoode alongst
the Channell: which they endeauoured, till they
perceiued that by the continuance of that course,
they could not escape the power of my Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
All this time these two Fliboates were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them and me: and as the Slaues report that
swam a shore at Douer, they determined with
three Gallies to haue boorded each of those
Ships, and would haue executed that resolution,
but for the feare of her Maiesties great Galion (as
the tearmed the <hi>Hope</hi>) whose force that they shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2736:5"/>
in that kinde (considering the disaduantage
that twice sixe of the best Gallies that euer I sawe,
hath by fighting against one Ship of her force) I
doe as much commend, as otherwise I doe detest
their shamefull working in that full of cowardli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and weakenes, they rowed backe to the west<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and spent the day by running away: in
hope that the darkenes of the night would giue
them libertie sufficient to shunne the onely Ship
they feared, or that was in deede in the Sea at that
time, to giue them cause of feare, I meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them and Dunkerke or Newport. This er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
onely of theirs bred their confusion, as you
may perceiue by the sequell. For they no sooner
began that course of rowing backe againe; but I
instantly made signes for Captaine <hi>Iones</hi> in the
<hi>Aduantage</hi> of the Queenes, to come vnto me:
whom I presentlie directed to repaire to Callis
roade; and thence to send the al-arme vnto the
States armie prepared before Sluce: and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise
such men of warre as kept on the coast of
Flanders, vpon any other occasion, to stand off
to the Sea, to meete with the Gallies in the night,
which should be chased by me with my lights in
my Top-mast heads, and a continuall discharging
of my Ordinance. Captaine <hi>Iones</hi> hauing shapte
his course according to my directions: I gaue
order for hoysing and trimming of my Sayles by
the winde, to keepe sight of the Gallies: the two
Fliboates being still a weather of me, did the like.
Which chase we held till sunne setting, obseruing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2736:6"/>
this course following all the day. They being a
weather of me, kept their continuall boords, that
the Gallies were alwaies betwixt them. And my
selfe being to Leeward, made such short turnes,
as I kept all the afternoone in a manner, euen in
the very eye of their course, betwixt them and
the place of their desseigne: euer discharging my
best Ordinance to warne the <hi>Answere</hi> of her
Maiesties, that ridde by my directions at the
Downes, vpon important seruice as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
knoweth: and the Flemmings that were
there, hauing left the Sea vppon vnknowne
groundes to me (yet sent from Portsmouth, by
the most prouident direction of her sacred Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
to awaite the comming of the Gallies, vpon
aduertisements that her Highnes receiued of their
being put to Sea) to set saile, who else had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
no vnderstanding of the Gallies: neither
came they within shot of them, till after night,
howsoeuer the reputation of the seruice is wholy
challenged by them.</p>
            <p>Hauing giuen your Lordship an account how
this day was thus spent by me, from eyght of
the clocke vntill the euening, and with these one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
helpes: I beseech your Lordship to be pleased
to vnderstand, that with the setting of the Sunne,
I could both discerne the Ships last mentioned
vnder sayle at the Downes, and the Gallies to
haue set their sayles: directing their course close
aboord our shore, each of them being out of
sight of the other, and my Dutch consorts by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2736:6"/>
this time to haue been left by the Gallies to a
sterne chase. When I perceiued them to holde
that course, which would bring them within shot
of the <hi>Answere,</hi> and the rest that were in the
Downes: I held a cleane contrary course from
them, towards the coast of France, to confirme
the secure passage they thought to finde on our
coast, which I continued, vntill the report of their
battery gaue me assurance of the Gallies being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
vnto tham.</p>
            <p>How the batterie began, who began it, how it
was continued, how ended, and to whom the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of the seruice is due, I leaue to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by your Lordship, by the perusall of the
true discourse following.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Answere</hi> of the Queenes, which Captaine
<hi>Bredgate</hi> commanded, as she rid more Southerly
at the Downes then the Flemmings, so came she
first to the Gallies, and bestowed 28. peeces of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
on them before the Flemmings came in,
who at length seconded him with very many shot.
During this batterie of ours vpon the Gallies,
(which I so terme, because they neuer exchanged
one shot) at the very first report of the <hi>Answers</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
I directed the Master of my ship to beare
vp with the South end of the <hi>Goodwin,</hi> with which
directions I deliuered my reasons publikely, as I
stood on the poope of my ship, <hi>viz.</hi> That if I stood
directly in to them, the Gallies, before I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
the place, would either be driuen a shore or
sunke, and so would there proue no neede of my
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2736:7"/>
force; or els by their nimble sayling they would
escape the ships, of whom (once getting a head)
they could receiue no impediment: for there was
no one shippe but the <hi>Aduantage</hi> in the sea that
could hinder them to recouer any port in Flanders
or the East Countries (Sluce onely excepted) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
I staied them at that sand head.</p>
            <p>Hauing recouered as neere that place as I desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
I staied at least a quarter of an houre, before I
could either see Gallie, heare or see any of those
Ships, their lights, or report of their Ordinance,
which made me and all my companie hold opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that they had outsailed the <hi>Answere</hi> and the
rest of the Flemmings, and shunned sight of me by
going a seaboord of my ship: which I so verely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued,
as I once directly determined to saile for Sluce,
with hope onely that the preparation which
I knew the States had there, would be able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
their entrance into that place.</p>
            <p>Whilest I remained thus doubtfull, or rather
hopelesse to hinder their recouerie of Dunkerke
or Newport, in case they had been a seaboord of
me, some of my companie descried a single Gallie
plying from the shore to get a head of my shippe.
When she approched within Caliuer shot, I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
aboue thirtie peeces of Ordinance of my
lower &amp; vpper tyre at her alone, my selfe with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other in my ship saw when her maineyard was
shot asunder, heard the report of many shot that
hit her hull, heard many their most pitifull out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries:
which when I perceiued to continue, and in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2736:7"/>
steed of making way from me, to neere me what
she could; I forbare shooting, and commaunded
one that spake the Portugall language, to tell them
that I was contented to receiue them into mercie:
which I would accordingly haue performed, had
not the other fiue Gallies offered to stand out a
head of me at that very instant, and thereby would
haue left me as they had done both the first two
Dutch shippes, and afterwards the <hi>Answere</hi> with
the rest of the Flemmings, had I omitted any
small time of executing the aduantage I had of
their being on my broad side, which as appeares
was so effectually employed (howsoeuer the night
wherein this seruice was performed, might hinder
the particular mention of their hurts) as none can
denie but that God pleased thereby onely to work
their confusion. For since that time none hath said
or can speake of any one shot made towards them:
yet foure of them are sunke and wracked, the
fift past doing the enemie seruice: and the sixt
they are forced to new build at Dunkerke, where
(if I bee not much deceiued) she will prooue
more chargeable then profitable, if the fault rest
not in our selues.</p>

thereof to three seuerall Captaines, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
whom no mention is made of the first:
and whereas there are but two in all sunke; I leaue
to be reconciled amongst themselues, and to your
Lordship, whether that the same of right appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
not to her Maiesties Ship the <hi>Hope,</hi> in respect
of the allegations before mentioned, euery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
whereof being to be prooued by the oathes
of my whole Companie, and maintained with
the hazard of my life with that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>1 As the shooting of the single Gallies main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
asunder, my bestowing aboue thirtie peeces
of Ordinance vpon that one Gallie, within lesse
then Caliuer shot.</p>
            <p>2 That they in the Galley made many lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
outcries for my receiuing them vnto mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</p>
            <p>3 That I would accordinglie haue receiued
them, but for giuing them ouer to encounter with
the other fiue Gallies, which els had left me to a
sterne chase.</p>
            <p>To these reasons I adde the assertions of the
Viceadmirall himselfe, who tolde me (whatsoeuer
he spake in other places) that one of the Gallies,
which he stemmed, had her maineyard shot asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
before his comming aboord her: by whom
soeuer she was then stemmed, your Lordship may
iudge, who ruin'd her, considering she made no
resistance, by his owne report, but by crying to
him for mercie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:2736:9"/>
Touching the other Gallie stemmed and sunke,
I haue alreadie proued how she (as all the rest) had
got a head the <hi>Answere</hi> of the Queenes not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and the rest of the States-men of warre with
her, who challenge the whole credit of this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice:
They (as all other Sea-men) cannot denie,
but that the Gallies will outsaile all Ships, in such a
loome gale of winde and smooth sea, as wee had
that night.</p>
            <p>The Gallies being then quicker of saile then
they, how could they by any meanes possible
fetch them vp, but by some impediment? Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they receiued none, but by my Ordinance:
which amounted to fiftie great shot at those fiue
which came last from the shoare, when al the ships
were aboue a mile a sterne.</p>
            <p>Some notwithstanding out of their detracting
dispositions may perchaunce say, that the two
which were wrecked at Newport would haue pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
by storme, though they had not been batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Whereto though I haue sufficiently answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
first in shewing that they might haue recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
any of the places thereabouts before 8. of the
clock that night but for me; and then the second
time before the morning, had they not been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
by me alone, at the South-sand head: yet
for further proofe that they miscaried by our bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie
onely, I say that if one of the Gallies which
receiued least damage by our Ordinance did out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue
Fridaies storme, continuing till Saterday
noone, being driuen among the Islands of Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2736:10"/>
to recouer Callis, then surely those two (vnles
they had bin exceedingly torne) would haue made
shift to haue recouered the Ports of Newport,
Graueling or Dunkerke: especially sith from the
place where I battered them, they might haue bin
at the remotest of those places about foure houres
before any storme began. But such seemed their
haste to saue their liues, as their thought ranne of a
shoare, and not of a harbour.</p>
            <p>Now that I haue deliuered vnto your Lordship
the whole and true discourse of this businesse, I
shall forbeare to trouble your patience with any
further relation of that night and next daies spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
my time (though the same in their chase had
like to haue cost her Maiestie her Ship, &amp; the liues
of as many as were in her) and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of their not holding her Maiesties ships, nor
I (her vnworthiest seruant) and then and yet by
her Highnes grace and your Lordships fauor, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
of the forces in that place, are not once men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned:
especially sith the sixe Gallies might safely
haue arriued before seauen of the clock that night
at any of the Ports of Flaunders to the Westward
of Ostend. And that the Dutch shippes had not
come from an anchor in the Downes, but for the
signes they receiued from me. Then that the force
of her Maiesties Shippe, wherein I was, enforced
them to keepe close aboord the English shoare,
whereby those Shippes in the Downes had power
giuen them to come to fight, which fight was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
by the <hi>Answere</hi> of the Queenes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:2736:10"/>
And lastly, sith the Gallies escaped their battery,
and had gotten a head those Shippes, aboue a mile
at least, and neuer receiued any impediment after,
but onely by me, who lingered them (as you haue
heard) vntill the comming vp of those Ships that
challenge to stemme them: which being granted,
I cannot see how any other credit can rightly be
giuen them (for that stemme I meane) then to a
lackey for pillaging of that dead bodie which his
master had slaine.</p>
            <p>ALthough this be a very true report of that
which was done in this seruice, and be a thing
very plausible to all that are well affected to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good
successe of her Maiesties affaires: yet should it not
haue mooued me much who were esteemed to
haue been the chiefe actor in so good a worke; or
to whom any augmentation of credit might grow
thereby, were it not that I haue found some, who (I
denie not) haue had their part in that seruice, haue
been so farre transported with the opinion of their
owne desert therein, as they haue not let in setting
foorth their owne commendation, to cast a staine
vpon other mens, who had a greater part in the
worke then themselues, as may appeare by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
aboue recited. Which notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding should
the lesse trouble me, if the touch thereof did reach
only to my selfe as a priuate gentleman: but seeing
the imputation, as it may be gathered in a Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
printed, containing a report of that seruice,
wherein no mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at al is made either of me, or of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2736:11"/>
any other her Maiesties seruants or Ships, or of any
of our nation, doth derogate not onely from my
selfe, but in some sort from the diligence and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancie
of al publike ministers of her Maiesties Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie:
it behoued me to haue so much sense of mine
and their reputations, as by a true report of the
thing (as indeed it was done) to redeeme the slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that in some mens conceits (whose eares are
quicke enough to receiue ill impressions of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
officers) might bee easily laid vpon vs. For
which onely cause is this report published. For
how little respect I had to affect reputation to my
selfe by publishing any report of that which had
passed in this seruice, may appeare by this one cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance:
that as soone as I had presented my self
to your Lordship, and Master Secretarie at the
Court at Oatelands, and bin by your Honors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to her Maiestie, and made report of that
which had passed: my first suite was, to be licensed
to goe into the countrie (as your Honor can well
witnes) whither immediatly I repaired attending
my owne busines, and from thence returned but
very lately, without any thought or purpose of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
my owne actions, or of any other thing,
more then of returning to my charge, vntill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the Citie I found euery mans mouth full
of an iniurious report of that seruice, and likewise
a Pamphlet printed by the procurement of some
who had had to do in that seruice, which did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the misconceit thereof. Wherefore I haue
been constrained to doe that, which otherwise (as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2736:11"/>
I haue said) is not agreeable to my nature, that is, to
speake of my selfe. But I shall be herein the more
to be excused, because the matter doth concerne
me not onely as a priuate person, but as a publike
seruant of the State: towards which it becommeth
me to make cleere all actions wherewith I am put
in trust. For which respect I must also adde this
much more; that if any man will take exception to
any point of that which I haue here aboue vpon so
good consideration set downe: I would haue him
vnderstand that I haue not lightly put foorth this
report, as a blast to fill mens eares: but so aduisedly,
that at all times I will be readie to maintaine and
iustifie the truth therof, in such sort as becommeth
a Gentleman professing Armes; and bearing the
charge, which by her Maiesties fauour I doe, to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
any thing, which he taketh vpon the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of his reputation to report. And
in assurance thereof I haue to
this report set my hand, and
published it in my
name.</p>
