            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE RUMP Roughly but righteouſly handled, In a New BALLAD:</head>
            <opener>To the tune of Cook Lorrel.</opener>
            <l>MOre ſacks to the Mill, here comes a freſh Wit,</l>
            <l>That means without Mittens (as you ſhall ſee</l>
            <l>To hundle a <hi>RUMP</hi> that's all to be ſhit,</l>
            <l>Sir reverence of the company.</l>
            <l>2. And let other ſinners that love a whole Skin,</l>
            <l>Keep out of my reach, for fear of a Stone;</l>
            <l>For I'm like the Hang-man, who (when's hand was in)</l>
            <l>Said he had as good truſs up fourty as one.</l>
            <l>3. Firſt I'le tell you whence this <hi>Rump</hi>-regnant came,</l>
            <l>When <hi>England</hi> to Faction and Schiſm was bent,</l>
            <l>By means of long peace to ſettle the ſame,</l>
            <l>Our noble King ſummon'd a Parliament.</l>
            <l>4. A Parliament which may make old men grieve,</l>
            <l>And Children that ne're ſhall be born complain;</l>
            <l>I mean ſuch as dy'd before they did live,</l>
            <l>Like <hi>Harrington</hi>'s <hi>Rota,</hi> and th' Engin of <hi>Vane.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>5. This Parliament, like a wild skittiſh Tit,</l>
            <l>Unman'd and unback't, and unapt to obey,</l>
            <l>Would let neither Prince, Peer, nor Prelate ſit,</l>
            <l>Yet ſtammell nos'd <hi>OLIVE<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> ſmelt out a way.</l>
            <l>6. With Piſtol and Muſquet he brought the Beaſt under,</l>
            <l>And aw'd<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it ſo much, and ſo far did prevail,</l>
            <l>That camely he dock't it, and (to all mens wonder)</l>
            <l>He caſt off the Colt, and ſadled the Tail:</l>
            <l>7. Which ſhortly began to kick at's Command,</l>
            <l>And reſtive it grew, and left its true pacing,</l>
            <l>Which made him reſolve on his own Legs to ſtand,</l>
            <l>And turn the <hi>RUMP</hi> out of the Stable a graſing.</l>
            <l>8. The Red-coats, with breath like my Ladys Bum-blaſt,</l>
            <l>This Parliament-ſnuff blew twice out and in:</l>
            <l>But North and Weſt-winds will ſo out it at laſt,</l>
            <l>That nought but Hell fire ſhall out it agen,</l>
            <l>9. Though now they tempt <hi>Monk</hi> with a thouſand <hi>per annum</hi>
            </l>
            <l>In hopes that to worſhip, his face hee'l fall flat on;</l>
            <l>Yet he's wiſe enough to reſiſt and diſdain 'em,</l>
            <l>And cry, <hi>Get behind me, thou Bob-tail of Satan.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>10. Right pat with St. <hi>Georg</hi>'s this ſtory will jump,</l>
            <l>Poor <hi>Englands</hi> the Damſel appointed for ſlaughter,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Monk</hi> the St. <hi>George</hi> to kill Dragon <hi>RUMP,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And ſafely reſtore to the King his fair Daughter.</l>
            <l>11. The <hi>RUMP</hi> thus in groſs no more ſhall be plaid on,</l>
            <l>But now I will whet my Pen (if it pleaſe ye)</l>
            <l>To joynt it, and ſhew what foul parts it is made on,</l>
            <l>God grant that your ſtomachs prove not over-queaſie.</l>
            <l>12. Here's <hi>Lenthall</hi> once Mouth to the Parliament's mind,</l>
            <l>Though he at length acted the Fundaments part,</l>
            <l>Whoſe ſpeech was not breaking of ſilence, but Wind,</l>
            <l>And's giving the <hi>Thanks</hi> of the Houſe, but a Fart.</l>
            <l>13. 'Tis ſaid he's now ſick, and if't be the <hi>POX,</hi>

            <l>To th' General Rendezvous of all Traytors.</l>
            <l>16. But many I find this Opinion are firm in,</l>
            <l>That he has no real diſtemper at all,</l>
            <l>But feigns it; and like a prophetical Vermin,</l>
            <l>Runs from an old Houſe that is ready to fall.</l>
            <l>17. If <hi>Ludlow</hi> the ſtate of Grace had been in,</l>
            <l>And kept himſelf ſafe fro' th' Committee of Safety,</l>

            <l>18. Next comes the <hi>Rump</hi>'s God-flye, the <hi>John</hi>-like driver,</l>
            <l>King-abjuring <hi>ARTHUR;</hi> Sir, you (if I ken you)</l>
            <l>O'th' Biſhop's <hi>Vriah</hi>-like fall were Contriver,</l>
            <l>To get the fair <hi>Berſheba</hi> of their Revenue.</l>
            <l>19. But 'twas a more carnal concupiſcence</l>
            <l>That at <hi>Briſtol</hi>-Vicaridge ſet you a neighing,</l>
            <l>Which you enjoyd and occupyd in the ſence</l>
            <l>Which puts-pretty Maids to piſhing and fying.</l>
            <l>20. Nay you like the <hi>Trojan</hi>-Adulterer ſwore</l>
            <l>To thoſe that once ſaved you from the Kings Fury,</l>
            <l>That rather then <hi>Helen</hi> of <hi>Dureſm</hi> reſtore,</l>
            <l>Their <hi>Troynovani</hi> in its own aſhes you'd burn.</l>
            <l>21. But I dare no farther his paſſion provoke</l>
            <l>For fear of a prejudice which it may do me,</l>
            <l>For with his own Choler ſhould he chance to choke,</l>
            <l>The Hang-man in Action of Treſpaſs might ſue me.</l>
            <l>22. Then have at Sir <hi>Harry</hi> the Int'reſt Refiner,</l>
            <l>Who's not of the Church, but Society of JESUS,</l>
            <l>And can make Divinity's ſelf-Diviner,</l>
            <l>And model new Heavens and new Earths to pleaſe us.</l>
            <l>23. Twas he that injected the ſublimed matter</l>
            <l>To late-Lady <hi>Lambert,</hi> and ſhe to th' Squire,</l>
            <l>Which made him Protector and Parliament-hater,</l>
            <l>And to be <hi>Fift Monarch</hi> devoutly aſpire.</l>
            <l>24. Like Grub from Sheeps tayls ſince the <hi>Rump</hi> doth him throw,</l>
            <l>He'le creep to ſome placket of Sanctification,</l>
            <l>And come forth a Fleſh-flye next Summer, and blow</l>
            <l>New Maggots in's Church, of more whimſical faſhion.</l>
            <l>25. Methinks in his eyes the Waters do gather,</l>
            <l>As if the Lord <hi>Staffords</hi> Duſt troubled his ſight;</l>
            <l>Perhaps he repents, and intends (like his Father)</l>
            <l>Ev'n in his own Garter to do his Ghoſt right.</l>
            <l>26. There goes the twice treacherous Banquerout <hi>Sallaway</hi>
            </l>
            <l>From <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Wolves, to <hi>Tow'r</hi> Lions bound,</l>
            <l>Cauſe he from one Treaſon to another did fall away,</l>
            <l>And wil fall again, but not quite to the ground.</l>
            <l>27. The next is a politick pen-man that got-land</l>
            <l>By<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <l>That <hi>Laembeth</hi> ſhal ever and ever be Scot-land,</l>
            <l>And Seat of an Arch-one, but not of a biſhop.</l>
            <l>28. Here's <hi>Nevil,</hi> (who to be made in <hi>Scot's</hi> ſtead,</l>
            <l>A State-Secretary) did practice a New art,</l>
            <l>To th' Office, by Letters (unto the Houſe read)</l>
