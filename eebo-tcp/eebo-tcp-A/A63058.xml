            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Could heartily have wish'd there had been no Occasion offer'd, or Subject-matter for an <hi>Essay</hi> of this kind. After so happy and wonderful a Revolution as we have seen, when our Hopes were grown desperate, and our Liberty reduc'd to its very last gasp, to have the only Remedy in Nature so effectually apply'd, so mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous a Recovery perform'd; after all this, to find <hi>English-men,</hi> and such as pretend to no other <hi>Interest</hi> or <hi>Religion</hi> but That of their Country; to findThem expressing Dissatisfaction, every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where busie in sowing Dissention, obstructing, as far as in them lies, the Progress of Affairs, and unhinging the present Settlement (upon which alone depends the Safety of these Nations, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Quiet of <hi>Europe</hi>); This is so just a Cause of Indignation, as must make every Lover of his Countrey to turn <hi>Satyrist,</hi> or, at least, excuse the honest Zeal of such as upon this Occasion express their Resentments. To be unconcern'd for a Man's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is theworstwant of <hi>natural</hi> Affection: A Crime reputed so heinous amongst the more generous Heathens, that it divested the indulgent <hi>Brutus</hi> of all Compassion on his Sons, whom he submitted to the extremity of Punishment, for making Commotions in the new Settlement of the <hi>Roman</hi> Liberty.</p>

In tracing the Occasions of the late Disturbances and Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the State, I was unwillingly brought within the Verge of the <hi>Church.</hi> There is no Man that has a greater Veneration for the Sacred Function and Order, or the Discipline and Worship by Law establish'd; neither does the <hi>Passive Principle</hi> it self, that has so nearly endanger'd the Shipwreck both of State and Church, derive its source from the pure Fountain of our Reformation: 'Twas a new-sprouted <hi>Tail</hi> of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> that swept many of our <hi>Stars,</hi> tho but few of the First Magnitude; most whereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd themselves as soon as they were sensible of the Consequence,</p>

               <hi>What I have touch'd concerning Penal Impositions on Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the</hi> Nicene <hi>Assembly, (amongst whom were many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that preserv'd the Primitive Character), I must for the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence refer you to the Testimony of Church-Historians; inftan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing only one Passage in St.</hi> Hilary, <hi>who gives us this Account:</hi> Conscii sumus quod post Nicænam Synodum nihil aliud quam Fidem scribimus, dum in Verbis pugna est, dum de novitatibus quæstio est, dum de Ambiguis Occasio est, dum de Authoribus querela est, dum de studiis certamen est, dum in Consensu difficultas est, dum Alter Alteri Anathema esse

            <p>
               <hi>I cannot bètter make my Apology, than in the words of a late Writer upon this Occasion, who says,</hi> It is not their declaring their Opinion (wherein they seem to me to have light upon the Truth, if they had likewise upon the Measure) that could have moved me to speak with this liberty, but their imposing what was not contain'd in express words of Scripture, under Spiritual and Civil <hi>Penalties,</hi> contrary to the Privilege of Religion, and making a Precedent, follow'd and improv'd by all succeeding Ages, for most Cruel Perfecutions.</p>
            <p>There is no Person so obscure or inconfiderable, but might have observed our most zealous Protestants, both <hi>Church-men</hi> and <hi>Dissenters,</hi> to have been all along <hi>Properties</hi> to the Common Enemy; so visible have been the Triumphs and Insultings of <hi>Roman</hi> Emissaries upon the Animosities they have sown amongst us, and of which they reckon'd shortly to reap the Harvest.</p>
            <p>The Unreasonableness (that is to say, the <hi>Impossibility</hi>) of Force in matters of meer Conscience and Opinion, has demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it self through all Ages. Our Dissenters have had their Faults, and they have suffer'd: Neither is it the least Blessing amongst those Great and Many that seem to be reserv'd for His

                  <hi>Palæmon</hi> dwelt in his unenvied Seat;</l>
