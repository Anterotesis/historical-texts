         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE TRANSLATOR TO THE Christian Reader.</head>
            <p>THERE being so many Sects and Heresies banded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against the Truth, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that of <hi>Mahomet</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Muster, I thought good to bring it to their Colours, that so viewing thine enemies in their full bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, thou maist the better prepare to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, and I hope overcome them. It may happily startle thee, to find him so to speak <hi>English,</hi> as if he had made some Conquest on the Nation; but thou wilt soon reject that fear, if thou consider that this his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> (the Ground-work of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Religion) hath been already translated into almost all Languages in
<pb facs="tcp:36900:3"/>
Christendom, (at least, the most general, as the <hi>Latin, Italian, French,</hi> &amp;c.) yet never gained any Proselyte, where the Sword, its most forcible, and strongest argument hath not prevailed: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the greatest Doctors of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion have never alledged any thing for the truth thereof; but the success of their Wars, and greatness of their Empire, than which nothing is more fallacious: for that which both in former, and these latter Ages hath been common to the bad with the good, cannot be a certain evidence of the justice of a Cause, or the truth of Religion.</p>
            <p>Thou shalt find it of so rude, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous a composure, so farced with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, blasphemies, obscene speeches, and ridiculous fables, that some modest, and more rational <hi>Mahometans</hi> have thus excused it; that their Prophet wrote an hundred and twenty thousand sayings, whereof three thousand only are good, the residue (as the impossibility of the Moons falling into his sleeve, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version and Salvation of the Devils, and the like) are false and ridiculous. Yet is the whole esteemed so sacred, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cover thereof is inscribed—<hi>Let none touch it but he who is clean.</hi> Nor are the vulgar permitted to read it, but live and die in an implicite faith of what their
<pb facs="tcp:36900:3"/>
Priests deliver; which indeed (as saith<note place="margin">Grotius de ver. Rel. Christ.</note> the learned <hi>Grotius</hi>) is a manifest argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its iniquity: For that Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise may justly be suspected, which will not be sold, unless unseen: and though all Men are not alike perspicacious in the knowledge, and discerning of things, some by arrogancy, and vain conceit of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, others by affection; Some by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, being drawn into error: yet should we believe that the way to eternal life cannot be understood by them, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any respect of profit or preferment, seek it, submitting themselves, with all they have, to God, imploring his assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, we should sin against his infinite goodness. Therefore (<hi>Christian Reader</hi>) though some, conscious of their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stability in Religion, and of theirs (too like Turks in this) whose prosperity and opinions they follow, were unwilling this should see the Press, yet am I confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, if thou hast been so true a votary to orthodox Religion, as to keep thy self untainted of their follies, this shall not hurt thee: And as for those of that Batch, having once abandoned the Sun of the Gospel, I believe they will wander as far into utter darkness, by following strange lights, as by this <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> of the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> Such as it is, I present to thee, having taken the pains only to translate
<pb facs="tcp:36900:4"/>
it out of <hi>French,</hi> not doubting, though it hath been a poyson, that hath infected a very great, but most unsound part of the Universe, it may prove an Antidote, to confirm in thee the health of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>

               <hi>Coreis,</hi> who were enemies to his design. He intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this Book the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> as one would say, the Collection of Precepts: He likewise termed it <hi>El Forcan,</hi> that is, that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth good from evil: He divided it into many Chapters, to which he gave what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription he thought good: he most commonly
<pb facs="tcp:36900:5"/>
intituleth them with words that are in their first line, without regard to the matter they treat of, and speaketh little of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription; He divided it into many signs, or Verses, that contain his ordinances and fables, without observation either of the consequence, or connexion of the discourse, which is the cause that thou shalt find in this Book, a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of incongruous pieces, and divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions of the same things. It hath been expounded by many Mahometan Doctors, their exposition being as ridiculous as the Text; They affirm the original of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> to be written upon a Table, kept in Heaven, that the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> brought this Copy to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> who could neither write nor read, and stile him Prophet, or Apostle, in honour. Thou shalt find at beginning of some Chapters letters of the <hi>Arabick</hi> Alphabet, which some Men will not expound: They fear to utter things that may displease their false Prophet: Most of their Doctors affirm those letters to be the first letters of the Names of God. Thou shalt find the exposition in this version: Thou wilt wonder that such absurdities have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the best part of the World, and wilt avouch, that the knowledge of what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Book, will render that Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible.</p>

            <head>A SUMMARY OF THE Religion of the <hi>Turks.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE <hi>Turks</hi> believe one sole God, in one sole Person, Creator of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, the rewarder of the good, and punisher of the wicked; who hath created Paradise for the recompence of the righteous, and Hell for the last punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of crimes. They believe that <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> was a very great Prophet, whom God sent into the World to teach men the way of salvation, and call themselves <hi>Musul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> that is to say, recommended to God, or saved.</p>
            <p>They believe the Decalogue of <hi>Moses,</hi> and are obliged to observe it; they cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate Friday as the Christians Sunday, that day they assemble in Temples at noon, to pray.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:36900:6"/>They are obliged to pray five times a day, <hi>viz.</hi> in the morning, at noon, at the evening, when the Sun setteth, and an hour within night.</p>
            <p>They fast the Month, or Moon, which they call <hi>Ramazan;</hi> during this Month, they neither drink nor eat all the Day, until the Sun be set, but in the Night drink and eat, according to their appetites, Flesh and Fish, except the Flesh of Swine, and Wine, that is at all times forbidden them; after this fast they have the feast of great <hi>Bairan,</hi> as the Christians Easter after Lent. They are great founders of Temples, and Hospitals, and are obliged to give to the poor the first day of the year, the tith of what they have gained during the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding year.</p>
            <p>They believe, that after being well washt, saying some prayer appropriate to that Ceremony; they have also the Soul purified from all Filthiness and Sin, which is the cause that they wash and bath often, especially before they pray.</p>
            <p>They have no Sacrament, but Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision; they cause their Children to be circumcised at the age of seven or eight years; and when they can pronounce these words <hi>La ilha illa allha Mehemet rasoul allha,</hi> that is, There is but one God, <hi>Mahomet</hi> is his Prophet and Apostle; this is their profession of faith; nevertheless
<pb facs="tcp:36900:6"/>
there is no mention of Circumcision in all the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> they say they observe it in imitation of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whose Law is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to them by <hi>Mahomet:</hi> they believe that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> was brought to him at several times by the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> in the City of <hi>Mecca,</hi> and that of <hi>Medina,</hi> because the Jews and Christians had alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Holy Scriptures, and the Law of God.</p>
            <p>They are permitted to have four Wives, married at the same time, and as many Concubines as they are able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>They can put away their Wives when they think fit, paying them what they promised them in contract of marriage, and marry again at their pleasure; but the Women are bound to tarry until they are assured that they are not with Child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they marry again, and their Husbands are obliged to keep, and take the care of the Children. The Children which they have by their slaves are indifferently esteemed with those of their Wives, and are all held as legitimate.</p>
            <p>They have Temples, Colleges, and Hospitals well revenued; they have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of Religious, that live exemplarily; obey their Superiours without contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and dance after the sound of Flutes and other instruments when they make their prayers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:36900:7"/>They have moreover another sort of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Vagabonds through the World, clothed like fools of that Country; they often go naked, and cut their skin in many places, are held to be holy persons, and live by alms, which are never refused them; both the one and the other sort of Religious are called <hi>Dervis,</hi> they are known by their habit, and can retire and marry when they please.</p>
            <p>They deny Jesus Christ to be God, or the Son of God; neither believe they in the Holy Trinity: they say that Jesus Christ was a great Prophet, born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> a Virgin both before and after her delivery; that he was conceived by divine inspiration, or by a divine breath, without a father, as <hi>Adam</hi> was created without a Mother; that he was not cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that God took him into Heaven, and that he shall come again on earth at the end of the World to confirm the Law of <hi>Mahomet;</hi> they likewise affirm that the Jews thinking to crucifie Jesus Christ, crucified a man among them that resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him.</p>
            <p>They pray to God for the Dead, they invoke their Saints, of whom they have a large Legend, nevertheless they believe not Purgatory; and many among them<note place="margin">A great question a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans.</hi>
               </note> imagine that the Soul and body remain to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the grave until the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:36900:7"/>They have <hi>Mecca</hi> and <hi>Medina,</hi> that are two Cities of <hi>Arabia,</hi> in great veneration, because <hi>Mahomet</hi> was born at <hi>Mecca,</hi> and buried at <hi>Medina:</hi> they make thither great pilgrimages, and believe that Land to be Holy: They bear likewise singular respect to the City of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> for that it hath been the Birth-place, and habitation of many Prophets.</p>
            <p>They use no Clocks; at the hour of their prayers their Priests ascend the highest part of a Tower, that is in a corner of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and with a loud voice call the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to prayer, singing prayers, composed for that purpose.</p>

            <head>THE LIFE and DEATH OF MAHOMET, THE Prophet of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and Author OF THE ALCORAN.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>MAHOMET,</hi> the Son of <hi>Abdalla,</hi> a vicious Pagan, was born <hi>Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humus</hi> at <note n="*" place="margin">Now a City cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na-talnabi, [i e.]</hi> the Town of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</note> 
               <hi>Iesrab,</hi> then a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of <hi>Arabia Foelix;</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Jewess, both by Birth and Religi on, dying when he was two years old, left him to his <note n="†" place="margin">Some will have him to be his Grand father.</note> Uncle <hi>Abdal Mutalib,</hi> who being of vile condition, and unable to give him education, above the common ignorance and irreligion of his Country, at the age of sixteen years, abandoned him
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:36900:12"/>
to fortune, or after the barbarous custom of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> sold him to the <hi>Ismaelite</hi> Merchants, who exposing him to sale in the Markets, he was purchased by <hi>Abde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monople,</hi> a wealthy Merchant; He after some observation, and experience of his wit and industry, withdrew him from the common drudgery of a slave, to employ him with his other Factors in Commerce, and finding him apt for those Affairs, gave him the conduct of his Camels into <hi>Syria, Egypt, Persia,</hi> and elsewhere. By which, in a short time, he became so expert in his Trade, that as he encreased the wealth and profit of his Master, so he gained his good will and affection.</p>
            <p>At that time <hi>Heraclius</hi> being Emperor of the East, and the seamless Coat of the Church torn by variety of Sects, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, the Bishops and Governors in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> justly fearing Divine vengeance, by reason of the <hi>Nestorian</hi> Heresie, which, with that of the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> began afresh to infect their Clergy, deliberated on some Ecclesiastical censure against them: When <hi>Sergius</hi> a Monk, and Sectary of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> conscious of his error, and dreading the punishment, fled secretly into <hi>Arabia,</hi> and found retreat and entertainment with <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonople,</hi> the Master of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> where finding slender hopes of propagating his infectious Heresie (the Family being <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi>)
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:36900:12"/>
and less of overthrowing his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites in Religions, he resolved to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge on Christianity it self, and to that effect began to practise on <hi>Mahomet,</hi> as a subject prepared to receive the impression of his design.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Abdemonople</hi> died, his Riches being augmented through the care and industry of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who having before insinuated into the favour of his Mistris <hi>Ajissa,</hi> by Presents of rare Toys, procured in his Travels, by them, or through Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery (of which he was held guilty, and laboureth to purge himself in his <hi>Alcoran</hi>) so charmed her affection, that of her slave, he was advanced to be Lord both of her Person and Fortunes.</p>
            <p>Being thus grown opulent, he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time continued his Trade, but then willing to take ease, as he had, during the Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages through several Countries, been a seeker, and inquisitive concerning the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of Religions professed through the Universe; so now (though irresolute which to follow) he rejected all, as vain, and foolish, except <hi>Iudaism</hi> and <hi>Christianity;</hi> and approving the latter as the best, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly framed his life, assuming a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious form of Sanctimony, which bred ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration in them that considered his former Education, and gave him a repute above his expectation. But this hasty
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:36900:13"/>
Fruit was soon corrupted, and with the touch of Ambition (like the Apples of <hi>Sodom</hi>) soon vanished into stink and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Sergius,</hi> as subtile, as malicious, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving his disposition, and withal, after some discourse concerning the two Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of both which he found him excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ignorant, seeing it no difficulty to distill into him the poyson of his Heresie, easily perswaded him, That Jesus Christ was but Man simply, that for the merit of his vertues he was held as Deified: that the sufferings of his death were but humane inventions; that he was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from this life to an immortal, and glorious, by another way than that of Death; That there is but one God, in one Person; so that the Faith of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans is vain, and invented, and that of the <hi>Iews</hi> too loose, and lean, through their own obstinacy. That the <hi>Arabians</hi> being a dull and ignorant people, inclining nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the one nor the other, but all (as many as had been touched with the fame of his new sanctity) admiring his perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; The <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> being like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise enemies to each other, and the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> at variance among themselves; He might in that juncture of affairs, assume the title of a Prophet sent from God, to disabuse the one, and the other, and save
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:36900:13"/>
the World by another Law. This Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of <hi>Sergius</hi> took the desired effect, and <hi>Mahomet's</hi> thoughts, before enflamed with his new gotten wealth, and fame, now entertained more ardent desires of being esteemed a Prophet, looking upon all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attributes of Religion, and sanctity, as vile and abject.</p>
            <p>To this effect, on a sudden he retires to a solitary Cave, not far distant from <hi>Mecca,</hi> while <hi>Sergius</hi> proclaimed the vain perfections of his Life, and filled the ears of the people with the noise of his deservings. The term of two years expired, <hi>Mahomet</hi> again appears to the World, and as if newly returned from the Oracles of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, stileth himself a Prophet sent from God, who willing through his mercy, to withdraw him from that precipice of his everlasting ruine, and admonish him of his error, afflicted his body with the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling sickness, which <hi>Mahomet,</hi> instead of repenting, made an advantage to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move his wicked design. For his Wife lamenting to see her self yoaked to one so diseased, and tormented with an hideous infirmity, he excused it, and easily wrought in her a belief, that being constrained frequently to converse with the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> his frail body, unable to abide the splendor of his heavenly presence, fell into that distemper, and at the departure
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:36900:14"/>
of the Divine Ambassador, recovered its former condition. His Wife believing this, was not wanting to divulge the rare qualities of her husband, his admirable sanctity, and frequent converse with the Angel, which gained him the esteem of a Prophet in his own house, and reverence among his Neighbours.</p>
            <p>That this Infant repute of his Holiness might be the better strengthned, <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> thought it requisite to promulgate some Chapters of his <hi>Alcoran</hi> (as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance of his Commission) which as he saw occasion, he shaped (though ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favouredly) to his designs, giving out that he received them from the Angel <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel,</hi> as the Counsel and precepts of God, who for that he had not saved Men, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> the Psalms of <hi>David,</hi> or the Gospel of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> did now promise them infallible Salvation by the means of the Alcoran, which though rudely, yet cunningly contrived, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with the loose humor of the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi> enjoyning nothing strict or bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensome, but leaving all to liberty; as the sole means to allure them to a belief of it, induced first the Parents and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of his Wife, then the more ignorant and meaner sort to embrace it, and esteem <hi>Mahomet</hi> as the Messenger of God sent to guide them into eternal felicity, and the
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:36900:14"/>
enjoyment of Paradise, which the easier to ensnare them, he feigned to be full of such pleasures as fall under sense, and a plentiful fruition of those delights, that in those more barren and desert parts of <hi>Arabia</hi> they exceedingly wanted.</p>
            <p>Having thus drawn to his devotion, a numerous, though vulgar party of the people, who in opinion of his Prophetical Function were prompt to his obedience; he thought it altogether as easie to obtain a Kingdom, as he had found it not difficult to attain to the title of a Prophet; and to effect this, having before, under pretence of Reformation of Religion, gained many followers, while more stood as lookers on, not at all regarding that Decoy; he resolved to yoak to it that other concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in popular disturbances, liberty, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming it to be the will of God, that all Men should enjoy it, and that the Edict might be first obeyed in his own family, enfranchized his Slave, called <hi>Zeidi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This bait, as it inhaunced his fame, so it added to his retinue; for as multitudes, affecting novelty, and a mutation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, daily added themselves to his party; so slaves from all parts of <hi>Arabia</hi> forsook their Masters, and fled to him as their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and embraced his Law, as the means of their salvation. These through a fond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of his piety, ready to sacrifice their lives
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:36900:15"/>
at his command, he divided into troops, and sent to rob the Caravans of Merchants that travelled through the desarts; and by this means, having added to his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure by spoil; and his retinue daily encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by a multitude of Fugitives and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds, who by reason of this liberty, to act any villany, resorted to him; he at length took up thoughts of imploying them in the confirmation of his Law, which he knew to be the ready way to his establishment, in that power to which he aspired.</p>
            <p>To this purpose, he marcheth with his Troops towards <hi>Medina</hi> (the place of his Birth and Burial) to preach in a <hi>Synagogue</hi> of Jews there inhabiting. These less stupid than the <hi>Arabians,</hi> could not endure his impostures, and instead of believing, did handsomly beat him, and drive his train from the Town. This repulse rather irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting than terrifying him, he drew all his force into the field, and assailed the <hi>Iews</hi> in two several conflicts; in one of which, by a wound on the face with a sword, that broke out his fore teeth, He signed the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of his Law with his Blood, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a long time as dead in a ditch; but being rescued by his Slaves, and recovered of his wound, he again sought and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished them, and converted their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue into a Temple, for his own use.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ix" facs="tcp:36900:15"/>The fame of his exploits increasing, with the number of his Sectaries (to whom some Princes, and eminent persons of the Country began to encline, giving him their Daughters in Marriage) awakened the Nobles of <hi>Mecca,</hi> particularly the family of <hi>Coreis,</hi> who wisely judging a new form of Religion, propagated by a new way, force of arms, must inevitably introduce a new Government, of which <hi>Mahomet,</hi> of base and obscure beginnings, would be chief, as the Author, opposed themselves to his designs, expelled all such as seemed to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour him out of the City, and several times gave him battel; in which he so va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly deported himself, that though he was sometimes put to the worst, yet he more often prevailed; and giving freedom to such prisoners as would embrace his Law, incorporated them into his Army, strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himself, and weakning his enemies. Being in fine a compleat Conqueror in the field; he assaulted the City of <hi>Mecca,</hi> took it, and after some slaughter of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, his enemies, proclaimed impunity to all that would acknowledge him a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of God, by whose favour (as he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) and appointment, not by his own valour, he had attained to that honor. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this proclamation, many for fear of present danger, and apprehension of future bondage, more out of ignorance, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:36900:16"/>
his belief, and he enjoyed the vain feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, to see himself General of an Army, Lord of a vast Country, and to be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and reverenced as a Prophet.</p>
            <p>About that time <hi>Heraclius</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, disposing himself rather to improve the Heresie of the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Confines of the Empire, not only permitted <hi>Mahomet</hi> to domineer in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi> but gave advantage to <hi>Cosroes,</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi> King, to invade his dominions: but at length awakened by the alarms of so puissant an Enemy, levied a strong Army, and summoned the <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Sarra</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies in their tongue a Desart, and <hi>Sahen</hi> to inhabit. See <hi>Sands</hi> his Travel.</note> 
               <hi>Saracens</hi> (a people so called from their inhabiting the Desart) to his assistance. The <hi>Persian</hi> van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished, and the <hi>Saracens</hi> expecting the salarie of their labours, and with some importunity demanding it, were answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the Emperor had not sufficient Treasure to pay the <hi>Christian</hi> Troops, and therefore those Heathen Dogs must attend the conveniency of their Prince. Incensed by this contempt, they retired and marched by the way of <hi>Africk,</hi> where finding <hi>Mahomet</hi> busie to enlarge his Power; he aggravated their discontents, affirming it to be the will of God, that all Men should enjoy their Liberty, that God was offended at their oppressions, and willed them to oppose the tyranny of the <hi>Christians,</hi> and that whosoever died in that
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:36900:16"/>
holy War, his soul should be instantly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported to Paradise. These motives raised them to a resolution of making defection; so that they elected <hi>Mahomet</hi> their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, who incontinently deprived the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Heraclius</hi> of his Tribute, and his Officers (who were slain in demanding it) of their lives. After this act, the whole Province, with that of <hi>Egypt,</hi> revolted, and the people generally esteeming the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s arms (which he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to employ) as a sure testimony of the goodness of his Cause, embraced his Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Heraclius</hi> having neglected to strangle this rebellion in its birth, endeavoured to extinguish it, being now grown to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable strength; and to that end sent an Army under the conduct of <hi>Theodosius</hi> his Favorite; his Army was twice over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, the General slain, and the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans</hi> pursuing their victories, took from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the Countries of <hi>Egypt, Syria,</hi> and other Provinces of <hi>Africa,</hi> where <hi>Mahomet</hi> encreased his Triumphs and erected his <hi>Trophies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being now grown impotent, rather through his inordinate life, than burthen of years, he retired full of glory, as a King and Prophet, to <hi>Mecca,</hi> where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to end his days, having affirmed it in the <hi>Alcoran</hi> to be the most holy City of
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:36900:17"/>
the World: as that wherein stood the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Abraham,</hi> built miraculously by <hi>Angels,</hi> to be the Sanctuary of all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair thither in Pilgrimage. And therefore it was, that when he had by his Armies taken the City of <hi>Antioch,</hi> he durst not enter into it in person, lest by the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and fertile situation of it, he should have been enticed to desert <hi>Mecca,</hi> and contradict his own Prophecy. His life now drawing to a period, a Pleuri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For he told his followers that he should rise again the third day, and ascend to Heaven. They observed this, and guarding his Corps four days entire, with impatient expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Resurrection, were at length compelled, by reason of its putrefaction, to take him up, and bury him at <hi>Medina,</hi> where his Reliques are annually visited by the superstitious Pilgrims of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.

Earth to crow: This Angel recommended him to another, he to a third, and so one to another, until he came to the Heaven, where God kept his residence. God cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously received him, asked him how his People did, how they entertained his Law, and familiarly laid his Hand upon his Shoulder, which was so cold, that it pierced to the marrow of his Back-bone. God had soon done with him, only telling him how often his People should make their Prayers, which were so many, that as he was returning, in the fourth Heaven, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> advised him to go back to God, and entreat him that fewer Prayers might serve his turn, for his People were not able to make so many; which he did, and after many returns, brought the number to five. This done, he went back to his <hi>Elborach,</hi> which in a moment brought him to his House in <hi>Mecca,</hi> where he went to bed again to his Wife, she not once dreaming her Husband would leave Heaven for her company, or thinking he had been there; all this he performed in the tenth part of a Night. The <hi>Turks</hi> at this day fondly believe this as a Truth; but the <hi>Arabians</hi> of his time requiring him to do as much in their view, he (unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take again so long a Journy) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, Praised be God, I am Man, and an

Apostle. He had other slights, which in sight of the People, by Art or Sorcery, he performed, and they stupidly belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and entertained as Miracles: as a Pigeon being by him taught to come and pick a Pease out of his Ear, he told them it was the Holy Ghost that came to tell him what God would have him do; so an Ox brought him a Chapter of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran</hi> upon his Horns, in a full Assembly. He likewise perswaded them, that being at dinner at the House of one that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be his Friend (who had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to poyson him, or he at least was so informed) a shoulder of Mutton ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in to the Table, forewarned him that he should not eat of it; and though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were present, none but he heard or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood the Language of the Mutton, and yet he permitted one of his dearest Friends to eat of it, and die impoysoned. Such, and many of the like nature were his Miracles: As the bowing of Trees, shaken by some sudden gust of Wind; the howling of Wolves, and braying of Asses, which is their Language, desiring <hi>Mahomet</hi> to pray for them; and he Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically understanding, as religiously performed. His custom was often to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate into the Ears of his Auditors, that God gave him commission to fulfil his
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:36900:18"/>
own desires in all things; and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose introduceth God speaking to him. To thee, O Prophet! It is permitted to lie with all Women that are given thee, or thou dost purchase, thy Aunts and Kindred, and all good Women that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire thy company; and this is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for thee alone. His Issue was one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Son, called <hi>Cassim,</hi> who died before him, and many Daughters; <hi>Fatione</hi> the eldest (in high esteem at this day among the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and honoured as the royal root of <hi>Aben Alabecy</hi>) was Wife to <hi>Haly. Zei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neb</hi> the second, was married to <hi>Osmen,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Son to <hi>Mahuvias,</hi> and perhaps to both successively, for they both succeeded in the Empire of <hi>Arabia;</hi> to her is attributed the original of the other Family of <hi>Aben Humeia.

Though it may be dangerous to such as like Reeds are shaken, and like empty clouds carried about with every wind of Doctrine; yet to staid and solid Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the reading of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Heresies will be no more dangerous, than the reading of those errors which are recorded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for in them are mentioned many
<pb facs="tcp:36900:20"/>
damnable errors and abominations of the <hi>Egyptians, Canaanites, Hittites, Sidonians,</hi> and other <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> themselves, of the <hi>Sadducees</hi> who denied Spirits, Angels, and the Resurrection.</item>
               <item>2. Is there more danger in reading the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> than in reading the Errors of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and modern Hereticks? surely <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, Irenaeus, Epiphanius, Austin,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fathers were not of this opinion, who have left upon record to posterity, the damnable Heresies of <hi>Arians, Eutychians, Nestorians, Macedonians,</hi> and others: and in the <hi>Alcoran</hi> there are not such danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous errors as among the <hi>Tetratheites, Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> and <hi>Theodosians,</hi> who held there were four Gods, or the <hi>Tritheites,</hi> who affirmed there were three, or the <hi>Gnosticks, Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheans, Cerdonians, Marcionites,</hi> who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained there were two contrary gods, the one good, the other bad, whereas the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran</hi> sets down there is but one true God; and although it denieth with <hi>Arius,</hi> the Divinity of Christ, yet it holds him a great Prophet; nor doth it speak so blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously of Christ as the <hi>Simonians,</hi> who held <hi>Simon Magus;</hi> or the <hi>Ophites,</hi> and <hi>Manicheans,</hi> who said, the Serpent was Christ; or <hi>Menander,</hi> who affirmed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be Christ, and the Saviour of the World. Besides; Are not the damnable Heresies of the modern <hi>Familists,</hi> who
<pb facs="tcp:36900:21"/>
deny Christ's Divinity, making as many Christs as there be illuminated Elders in their Congregations? are not also the Heresies of the <hi>Socinians, Anti-trinitarians, Adamites, Servetians, Antisabbatarians,</hi> and many others exposed to the view of all that will read them? why then may not the <hi>Alcoran?</hi> Besides, are Men debarred from reading the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Poets? nay, are not many of them translated into our English tongue? as also the modern Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the East and West <hi>Indies,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are more damnable Tenets than any in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and they who have read the <hi>Iewish</hi> Talmud, and <hi>Cabala,</hi> will find them as ridiculous pieces as the <hi>Alcoran.</hi>

               <item>3. If there were any loveliness, beauty, excellency, or any thing else in the <hi>Alcoran</hi> that might win the mind, and draw the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection after it, I should hold the reading of it dangerous, but whereas it is such a mishapen and deformed piece, I think the reading of it will confirm us in the truth, and cause us love the Scripture so much the more: for as a beautiful body is never more lovely than when she is placed near a Black-More, neither is truth more amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than when it is beset with Errors. <hi>Opposita juxta se posita clarius elucescunt,</hi> the Gem receives lustre from the <hi>foil,</hi> the Stars from the night, and Fire is most scorching in Frost; even so by an Antipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristasis
<pb facs="tcp:36900:21"/>
truth is fortified by error. Who can think that the sight of a Hob-Goblin, or deformed Vizard should draw the Child from the Nurse or breast of the Mother to embrace it; whereas the sight thereof will rather cause the Child hold faster by the Mother. The wise <hi>Spartans</hi> oft times brought Drunkards into the room, where their sons were, not that they should be induced thereby to love, but to abhor drunkenness, which they could not have done, had they not seen the unseemly and rude carriage, the undecent behaviour, and uncomposed gestures of the drunkard. When <hi>Zisca</hi> had destroyed the <hi>Adamites</hi> of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> he preserved two alive that they might reveal to the World the wicked errors of that Sect. Who is so mad as to prefer the embracements of a filthy Baboon, to his beautiful Mistress, or the braying of an Ass to a Consort of Musick? he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the ears of <hi>Midas</hi> that will prefer the Cuckows song to the sweet notes of the Nightingale.</item>
               <item>4. Though the <hi>Alcoran</hi> be received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many Nations, yet this reception proceeds not from any love they bear to it, or any loveliness they find in it, but partly out of fear, being forced by the Sword, partly out of a preposterous desire of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and preferment, and partly out of ignorance, as not being suffered to read
<pb facs="tcp:36900:22"/>
the Scriptures, nor to hear Philosophy, by which the errors thereof may be detected, nor to enquire into the absurdities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or to dispute and question any thing in it: for which cause also it is not suffered to be Printed, nor are Christians permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to enter into <hi>Mecca,</hi> lest the absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and impieties of their Religion should be manifested: and thus are those silly souls kept in blindness and ignorance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I never read that any Nation did vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily receive the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> except the theevish <hi>Saracens</hi> of <hi>Arabia,</hi> because it was a friend both to their theevery and leche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as permitting multiplicity of Wives and Concubines, and a reward for those that shall murther and rob.</item>

we shall with much more eagerness covet after the plenty of our Fathers house, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to us in his Word, where we shall find the hidden Manna, the bread of Life, that came down from Heaven.</item>

               <item>8. They that learn Arts and Sciences, desire the knowledg, not only of the good things, but of the evil things also, and the abuses of them, to the end they may avoid them; therefore Logick speaks as well of sophistical and fallacious syllogisms, as of demonstrative and topical; Ethicks treat of Vices as well as of Vertues; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philosophy handleth the natures, not only of useful and beneficial creatures, but also of hurtful and venomous, as of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents; Physick speaks of poysons as well as
<pb facs="tcp:36900:23"/>
of cures; Historians describe both the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and vicious actions of Princes; in Divinity we learn, not only what God and good Angels are, but also what Sathan is and his wicked Angels; in Navigation we must know, not only what places are Navigable, but also what are not; how shall we avoid Rocks, Quick-sands and Shelves, if we know them not? even so Christian Religion permits not only the reading of Scripture but also of heretical and heathenish books, as is said, that we may know what to embrace, what to shun; therefore if you would know what be the damnable errors to be avoided by Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, read the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and you shall find in it the sink of all, or most part of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Heresies.</item>

to admire and praise the goodness of God towards us Christians who having suffered a great part of the World to sit in the valley of the shadow of death, to be oppressed with Cimmerian, yea more than palpable <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkness, hath placed us in the Temple, where we have the Golden Candlestick of his Word, and a clearer and more durable Lamp than that of <hi>Salomon</hi>'s Temple, yea even the Sun of righteousness shining upon us in the land of <hi>Goshen,</hi> whilest a great part of the World doth follow the Antichristian beast, we follow the Lamb upon mount <hi>Sion;</hi> while they hear the voice of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres, Ostriches, and Schrich Owls, we hear the voice of the Turtle, and the Songs of Sion in our own Land: whilst they feed on husks with Swine, and drink the corrupted puddles of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, we are fed with Angels food, and eat coelestial Manna, and drink of the pure river of life clear as crystal: Again, we may tremble at the reading of this <hi>Alcoran,</hi> when we consider the severity of God's Judgments, and the fierceness of his anger, who for the contempt of his Gospel, in those Countries where <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> is worshipped, hath suffered so many millions of people to be deluded, blinded, abused, and inslaved by that false Prophet, to believe his lyes, and by loathing the

sweet Evangelical Manna, to devour greedily the poysonable Quails of his doctrine, and with it the wrath of God which hath faln on them whilst the flesh is between their teeth, so that they must needs perish everlastingly. Who would have thought that those Countreys which were honoured by God's own presence, by the Oracles of the Prophets, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, miracles, and preaching of Christ, by the planting of the Apostles, by the blood of so many Martyrs, should be thus besotted, and enslaved by the tyranny of this grand Impostor? When we think on those things, let us work out our salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with fear and trembling, and let him who thinks he standeth, take heed lest he fall: they were not greater sinners than we, therefore doubtless except we repent we shall all likewise perish; the remissness of <hi>Heraclius</hi> Government, his falling into the Heresie of the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Gospel, the slighting of the Pastors, the wickedness of the people, the continual Schisms, rents, jars, and divisions of their Churches, were both the causes and occasions of these mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which have faln upon them; let us take heed then we be not partakers of their sins, lest we also partake of their plagues.</item>

               <item>17. If you will take a brief view of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> you shall find it a hodg podge made up of these four ingredients. 1. Of
<pb facs="tcp:36900:28"/>
Contradictions. 2. Of Blasphemy. 3. Of ridiculous Fables. 4. Of Lyes: first, of Contradictions, he doth ordinarily say, and unsay the same thing; one while he tells us, that he was the first that ever entred into <hi>Paradise,</hi> and elsewhere he says he found Men and Women there; sometimes he affirms that <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> shall be saved by their own Religion, and sometimes again, that none can be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved who embrace not his <hi>Alcoran;</hi> In one place following the Opinion of <hi>Origen,</hi> or rather of the <hi>Origenists</hi> he affirmed that all the Devils shall be saved; in another place he saith, only those Devils shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved who hearken to, and obey his <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran.</hi> Secondly, of Blasphemy, for he bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemeth God, in saying that he prayeth for <hi>Mahomet,</hi> intimating hereby that he is inferior to that God he prayeth to; he makes God also swear by Flies, Worms, and such base Creatures, as if he were their inferiour, whereas God having none greater than himself, swears only by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; He blasphemes the Father, in saying he cannot have a Son, because he is not married, as if there were no other genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but what is carnal; he blasphemes the Son with <hi>Arius,</hi> in denying his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; he blasphemes the Holy Ghost with <hi>Macedonius,</hi> affirming him to be the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Creature; he blasphemes God
<pb facs="tcp:36900:29"/>
also, in making him the Author of his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> bragging that his name is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon the Throne of God, in that he is the greatest of the Prophets, who hath more knowledge than all the Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of the World: and many other brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging words he uttereth of himself, by which we may see he is that little Horn which did spring up among the ten Horns of the great and terrible Beast of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, destroying three of the <hi>Roman</hi> Horns, to wit, the <hi>Asians, Grecians</hi> and <hi>Egyptians;</hi> this is the Horn that hath many Eyes, as being crafty and vigilant, but his mouth speaks proud things, in blaspheming and bragging, as we have heard. Thirdly, of ridiculous Stories, and which are more unsavory than the <hi>Golden Legend,</hi> or <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>'s true Narrations; he tells us that he divided once the Moon, one half where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of fell into his lap, (this was not then the Man in the Moon, but the Moon in the Man) the other on the ground; these two pieces he souldred again. Perhaps in memory of this lying Miracle, the <hi>Turks</hi> use yet the half Moon for their Arms: He tells us of a great Army of Men and Angels raised by <hi>Salomon,</hi> but much hindred in their march by an Army of Flies, which <hi>Salomon</hi> rebuked, where we have a witless conference between <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> and the Fly; he tells you a strange
<pb facs="tcp:36900:29"/>
Story of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark, how there the Hog was generated of the Elephants dung, and a Rat of the Hogs dung, which gnawing a hole in the Ark, at which <hi>Noah</hi> was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted; he touched the Lyon on the Forehead, out of whose Brains leaped out a Cat, as (<hi>Minerva</hi> did out of <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s) which caused the Rat to run away: this is Philosophy indeed for a Hog. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of Lyes, for he belyeth God, in making him Author of his Impiety and Heresies; he belyes Christ, in saying he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the smell of a Rose; he belyeth the Holy Ghost, in affirming that he inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Mahomet</hi> to write the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> he bely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> calling her the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Amram,</hi> and sister of <hi>Moses,</hi> confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her with <hi>Miriam,</hi> whereas there were so many generations between; he belyeth the Gospel, in saying it is corrupted by Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; he belyeth Christians, when he saith they worship many gods, and that they give to God a companion, when they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Divinity of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he belyeth the <hi>Iews</hi> in saying they make <hi>Eleazer</hi> a god; he belyes the Patriarchs, in saying that <hi>Noah, Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> being so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years before he was born, or his <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran</hi> had any existence; he belyes also the Apostles, in making them his Scholars, who lived near six hundred years before
<pb facs="tcp:36900:30"/>
he was born: by all which we may see who was the Compiler of this <hi>Alcoran,</hi> not the God of Truth, but the Father of Lyes; not Christ and his Apostles, whose weapons in propagating the Gospel, were powerful Preaching, Miracles, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in Suffering; not the Sword, the chief means that <hi>Mahomet</hi> useth to force his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> an instrument forbid by Christ, but used by him who hath been a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer from the beginning; but I will not take upon me the task of refuting the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran,</hi> being already refuted by <hi>Canta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuzenus, Richardus</hi> the Monk, <hi>Cusa</hi> the Cardinal, <hi>Woodmanstadius, Savanorola</hi> and others. I only thought good, upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty of some learned and religious Men, to prefix this brief Caveat, that the Reader might be the better armed to encounter with any rub or difficulty he shall meet with in the reading thereof. But before I end, give me leave to clear my self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in this point, that it is not my meaning all should have the liberty to read the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran</hi> promiscuously. I know with the Apostle, that though all things be lawful, yet all things are not expedient, there are Children as well as Men in understanding; the Nurse may use that Knife which the Child may not, and that Sword which may without danger be handled by a sober Man, cannot without danger be touched
<pb facs="tcp:36900:30"/>
by a mad Man; there are as well queasie as strong stomachs, and what is Meat to the one may be Venom to the other; though <hi>Mithridates</hi> could without hurt eat Poyson, others may not presume to escape so; it is lawful for any to look upon a Monster, but it is not expedient for conceiving Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; that Iron which an Ostrich can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest, may destroy the stomach of other Creatures; how many have been decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in gathering Hemlock for Parsly? It is not for every Man to meddle with Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries Drugs, he may chance meet with Poyson as soon as an Antidote; if all Men were like Bees, to suck Hony even out of Henbane, there might be no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in reading the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> but most Men are like Spiders, suck securely Poyson e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of the sweetest Roses; therefore they only may surely and without danger read the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> who are intelligent, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, learned, and throughly grounded in Piety, and principles of Christianity; but weak, ignorant, inconstant, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected minds to the Truth, must not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to meddle with this unhallowed piece, lest they be polluted with the touch there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as they were who came near to a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous Body; and if we will not venture to go into an infected House without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servatives, much less should any dare to read the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> that is not sufficiently
<pb facs="tcp:36900:31"/>
armed with Grace, Strength, and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, against all temptations. God grant we may walk in the light of the Gospel whilst we have it, that we may not be overwhelmed with the dismal night of <hi>Mahometan</hi> darkness, which God may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inflict upon us; for our sins, rents and divisions are no lesser than those were of the <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Asiatick</hi> Churches, and doubtless except we repent we shall all perish with them, who for despising Gods sacred Oracles, are now taught to reverence every piece of paper they find, which they are made believe shall be put under the soals of their feet when they walk over the burning grate to their fools Paradise, as <hi>Busbequius</hi> in his Epistle tells us, who lived long amongst them, and was well acquainted with their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but what I have written here concerning the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> I submit to the judgment and wisdom of those who sit at the Stern, and can see more than the Passengers.</item>

are fools, and know it not. When they met with such as believed in God, they said, We<note place="margin">See <hi>Gelal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din.</hi>
                  </note> believe as you do: And when they returned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Devils, their Companions, they said, We believe as you, and mock at those men: Certainly God mocketh them, and continueth them in their Errours, to their confusion. They that have purchased Errour, for the right way, have gained nothing in their commerce, and are not well directed; they are like to such as kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led fire, and when it hath enlightened what is about them, God hath deprived them of light, and left them in darkness, deaf, dumb, blind, and they shall never be converted: or as a cloud of Heaven, full of darkness, thunder, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they stop their ears with their fingers, by reason of the noise, and for fear of death; but God seeth the unbelievers, he caused lightning to approach, that ravished from them their sight; they have followed what appeared to them, and are detained in darkness: But if God had pleased, he had deprived them, both of hearing, and sight; for he is Omnipotent. O People, worship your Lord, who created you, and all that were before you; it may be that you will fear him that hath extended the Earth, that raised the Heaven, and caused Rain to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend; that caused the production of Fruits to enrich you. Say not, That God hath a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion equal to him, because you know the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. If you doubt that I have sent my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, come, and bring some Chapters like to the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and call to witness the Idols that you adore; if you are good men, if you have not done it, or cannot perform it, Fear the fire of Hell prepared for Infidels, and Idolaters; and declare to true believers, who do good works,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36900:37"/>
That they shall enjoy the immense pleasures of Paradise, wherein flow many Rivers; they shall there find all sorts of fair and savoury Fruits, which God hath prepared for them; they shall consider, if they be like to such as they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the world: They shall there have Wives, fair, and delicate, and shall dwell, in eternal feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: God is not ashamed to compare a little <note n="*" place="margin">The Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is a stinking Worm, frequently growing in Beds in hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</note> Puny to an extream Greatness: Now, so it is, that true believers know, that it proceedeth from their Lord. The wicked demand, what God doth mean by that comparison? He by this means mis-leadeth, and directeth many men; but mis-leadeth none, but the disobedient: Such as pervert his Testament, and his Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; such as retrench his Commandments, and defile the Earth, are damned. Why will you be impious, seeing that God hath given you life after death? He will cause you to die, he will raise you again, and you shall all return before him to be judged. He it is, that created what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is upon Earth, and ascending to Heaven, hath ordained seven Heavens, knowing all things. Remember to instruct men, that thy Lord said<note place="margin">See <hi>Kitab el tenoir.</hi>
                  </note> to his Angels, I would create a Vicar upon Earth; and when they answered, Wilt thou there place him that shall defile it, and shed Blood, while we exalt thy Glory, and sanctifie thee? I know said he, what you know not. He taught <hi>Adam</hi> the Names of all things, who discovered them to the Angels, to whom God said, Declare to me the Names of all things that I have created, if you know them; they replyed, Praise is due to thy Divine Majesty; we know nothing, but what thou hast taught us, thou alone art know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wise. He said to <hi>Adam,</hi> Declare to them the Names of all things that I have crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36900:37"/>
After he had taught them, God said, Did I not tell you, that I knew what is not, neither in Earth, nor Heaven; and that I understand what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you make manifest, and whatever you keep most secret? Remember thou, that we said to the Angels, Humble your selves before <hi>Adam;</hi> they all humbled themselves, except the Devil: He was already proud, and in the number of the wicked. We said unto <hi>Adam,</hi> Dwell thou and thy Wife in Paradise, and eat there what thou likest, but approach not that Tree, lest thou be in the number of the unjust. The Devil made them to sin, and depart from the Grace in which they were; then we said to them, Descend you enemies one to another, you shall have a dwelling upon Earth, and goods wherewith to live for a time. <hi>Adam</hi> begged pardon for his fault of his Lord; he pardoned him, because he is gracious and merciful, and said, Descend, and go all of you out of Paradise; there shall hereafter come to you, a guide from me. Such as shall follow him, shall be delivered from fear and affliction (at the day of Judgment;) such as shall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, and conceal my Commandments, shall<note place="margin">The <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> in the old and new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> burn eternally in the fire of Hell. O Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> remember the Grace I have done you, I will satisfie my Promises, perform yours, fear me, and believe in what I have sent from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, confirming what was before taught you; be not the first impious, and forsake not my Law at any rate; fear me, and cover not the Truth with a lye, neither willingly conceal it: Make your Prayers at the time appointed, pay Tithes, and worship your Lord with them that adore him. Will you command people that have no care of their Souls, to do good? Will you meditate upon Scripture, with observing it? En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36900:38"/>
for succour with Patience, and with Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers they abound not, but in them that are obedient, that believe they shall one day behold their Lord, and shall return before him to be judged. O Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> call to mind my favours. I have preferred you to all the world; fear the day, wherein one Soul shall not be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stised for another; when Prayer shall not be heard, neither ransom, succours nor protection be found for the wicked. Remember, that we delivered you from the hands of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who afflicted you through the violence of torments, who murthered your Children, abused your Wives; and that your Lord encreased your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, because of the Enormity of your Crimes. Remember, that we divided the Seas to save you, and that we drowned <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s men in your view; nevertheless, you worshipped the Calf, when we detained <hi>Moses</hi> with us forty Nights, in which you were extreamly to blame; after this, we pardoned you, it may be that you will give me thanks. We gave unto <hi>Moses</hi> the Book, that distinguisheth good from evil; perhaps you will be converted. Remember, that <hi>Moses</hi> said to his people, You were to blame for having<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gelaldin</hi> saith, the innocent slay the wicked.</note> adored the Calf; repent, and be converted to your Creator: Slay one another, that will be a thing acceptable to God; he will pardon your Crime, he is gracious and merciful. You said, O <hi>Moses,</hi> we will not believe thee, for that we see not God; then you were smitten with thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, you saw your Misery with your own eyes:<note place="margin">We have pardoned you: see <hi>Gelaldin.</hi>
                  </note> nevertheless, we raised you after your death; perhaps you will give me thanks. We covered you with the shadow of Clouds, we caused Manna and Quails to fall upon you, and said, Eat the good things we have given you. They
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36900:38"/>
did us no harm, when they murmured; they afflicted themselves. We said, Enter into that<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gelaldin</hi> saith it is <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> See <hi>Kitab el tenoir.</hi>

I will pardon your offences, and encrease the Graces of those that are righteous: then the wicked altered their words that were taught them; but I sent my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation from Heaven upon them, according to their demerits. When <hi>Moses</hi> demanded drink for his people, we said, Smite the Rock with thy Rod, incontinently there sprung forth twelve Fountains, and every man knew his place, where to drink: Eat, and drink the good things of God, and defile not the Earth any more. You said unto <hi>Moses,</hi> we are not satisfied with one sort of meat; entreat thy Lord that he give us what the Earth produceth, Beets, Cucumbers, Garlick, Lentils, and Onions; he said, Desire you to change good for evil? Go down into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> you will there find what you require. They were beaten with disgrace, and poverty, and returned into the wrath of God, for that they disobeyed his Commandments, and unjustly slew his Prophets, for which they were greatly to blame. All those that shall believe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Christians, Iews</hi> or <hi>Samaritans,</hi> such as shall believe in God at the day of Judgment, and do good works, shall be recompensed by their Lord, and be free from fear, and affliction, at the day of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.<note place="margin">See <hi>Gelal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din.</hi>
                  </note> When we received your promise, to believe in the Old Testament, we raised a Mountain over you, to over-shadow you, and said, Comprehend with affection, what we teach you, and remember; perhaps you will fear the fire of Hell, and disobedience; nevertheless, you have gone astray; without the mercy of your

Lord you shall be in the number of the damned. You know what befel those that observed not the Sabbath; we said unto them, Be ye abhorred, and despised as Apes; We left this punishment, as an Advertisement to their Temporaries and Posterity, and particularly, to be for an example<note place="margin">See <hi>Kitab el tenoir.</hi>
                  </note> to the true Believers. Remember thou, that <hi>Moses</hi> said unto the people, God commandeth you to sacrifice a Cow. They answered, doest thou mock us? He replyed, God defend me from being in the number of the ignorant. They said, Call upon thy Lord, that he instruct us what Cow that ought to be. He said, it must be a Cow of a middle age, neither young, nor old, and do what is commanded you; They said, pray unto thy Lord, that he shew us of what co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour it ought to be. It must, said he, be of a bright, yellow colour, that it may delight the eyes of the beholders. They said, invoke thy Lord, that he instruct us, what it ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble, and we shall (if it please him) be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to his Commandments. He said, God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth you, that it must be a Cow, that never bare the yoke, to till the earth, neither water the fields, round, and that hath never laboured, neither hath spot upon her Body. They said, thou hast now spoken truth; they then sacrificed her, and it wanted not much, but they had not done it: When you have slain any one, you are then full of wrath, and become proud; God bringeth to light whatever you conceal; We said, smite that dead Body with a piece of that Cow: so God raiseth again the dead <note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Turks</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that a man shall rise again, being smitten with the tongue of that Cow.</note>, and manifesteth to you his Miracles; it may be you will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them, yet your hearts are hardned, more obdurate than Rocks; for Rivers flow from Rocks, when they cleave and appear, or when

There be some that know neither to read nor write, that understand nothing of Scripture, but what they have learned from the lies of their Doctors, yet they think to be knowing Men. Misery is upon them that conceal the Scripture in their hands, that alter it, and say, that what they read proceedeth from God to profit any thing thereby. Misery is upon them, because of what their hands have written; Misery is upon them, and upon what they have gained, in blaspheming against God.

If Slaves have recourse to you, you shall redeem them, their deliverance is appointed you: Do you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve one part of the Scripture to abjure the other; The reward of any of you that shall do this thing, is ignominy in this World, and to be precipitated into the most grievous torments of Hell at the day of Judgment.

The East and West are Gods, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersoever men turn themselves, the Face of God doth there meet them, his Divinity extendeth through the whole Earth. They said, believe you that God hath a Son? Praised be God on the contrary; whatever is either in Earth or Heaven, appertaineth to his Divine Majesty, and all things obey him; he hath created Heaven and Earth, and when he willeth any thing, he saith, Be thou, and it is. The unbelievers said, if God speak not to us, or if thou performest no Miracles, we will not believe thee; their Predecessors have said as much, and their words have been like unto their hearts; we have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Miracles to appear to the righteous, and have sent thee to preach and instruct the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; inquire not why those that shall descend into Hell will not believe thee; the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> will not be satisfied of thee, until thou follow their opinion; say unto them, there is no better guide in the World than God: take heed lest thou follow their Appetites, after that thou hast comprehended the knowledge which we inspired into thee; who except God, will be thy defender? They whom we have taught the Scripture, that study and read it with truth, believe the contents of it; and they that do not believe, are damned. O Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> call to mind the favour that I did you; I preferred you before all the World, fear the day wherein one Soul shall not be able to assist another, when a Ransom shall not be accepted, neither excuse; and when the wicked shall not be protected.

God said, I will for a time enrich the Infidels also, and precipitate them into the fire of Hell, where they shall remain to all Eternity. When <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Ismael</hi> raised the Foundations of the Temple of <hi>Mecca, Abraham</hi> said, Lord accept our Vows; thou understandest all, and knowest all things: Lord give us the grace to be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to thy Commandments, and let a people issue from our Loyns that may observe thy Law: Shew us the way we ought to follow, and have mercy upon us; thou art gracious and merciful: Lord send to this thy people a Prophet of their Nation, to preach to them thy Commandments, to instruct them in Scripture and knowledge, and to purifie them, thou art Omnipotent and wise. No man shall abandon the Law of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> but to his own damage, I have chosen him in this World, and he is in the other, in the number of the just. Remember thou, that his Lord said to him, Be thou obedient to thy Lord, and trust thou in him; he said, I resign my self to God, Lord of the Universe: He commanded
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:36900:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Iacob</hi> and his Children, to follow the Law of God. My Children, God hath taught you his Law, trust you in him, be obedient to him even unto death. Were you present when <hi>Iacob</hi> was near unto death? and when he said to his Sons, Whom will ye adore after me? They answered, We will worship thy God, the God of our Fathers, <hi>Abraham, Ismael,</hi> and <hi>Isaac,</hi> one sole God; we resign our selves to his pleasure. The good that those men gained, remained to them, and the evil that you shall commit, shall be against you; enquire not after what they did. They have said, Be ye either <hi>Iew,</hi> or <hi>Christian,</hi> you shall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the right way.

If they believe as you do, they shall not erre; if they abandon your faith, they will have a controversie with you, but God shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect you; he understandeth whatever they say, and what they do; he hath purified his Law, and what better Purification is there, than that of his Divine Majesty? Say unto them, Will you dispute with us concerning God, who is your, and our Lord? We will answer with our Actions, and you shall answer with yours; all our confidence is in his Divine Pleasure. Will you say, that <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Iacob,</hi> and the Tribes, were <hi>Iews</hi> or <hi>Christians?</hi> Are you more knowing than God?

Some ignorant among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will say, Their Prophet doth not appoint them to turn the face to that side, to which they turned heretofore, when they made their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Say unto them, The East and West be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto God; he directeth in the right way whom he pleaseth.

Do ye believe to enter Paradise, unless that happen to you, that befel your Predecessors? They were touched with Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, and Diseases, and trembled, until that very instant that the Prophet said to the true believers that were with him; When shall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine succour come? notwithstanding Divine suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour was not far off; They shall question thee concerning what they ought to expend; Say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, you shall assist with your goods, your Father and Mother, your Allies, Orphans, the Poor, and Pilgrims. God will understand all the good you shall do; Fighting is enjoyned you, although it be against your Will; it may chance that you will shun that which is profitable to you, and likewise love what is pernicious to you, God knoweth what you know not. They shall ask of thee, if they shall fight in the Month of <hi>Mharam;</hi> say unto them, great Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels shall happen in this Month, that shall shut up to the people the way of the Law of God; and impieties, that shall hinder the multitude to go to <hi>Mecca.</hi> To drive the people from <hi>Mecca</hi> is an exceeding great sin: Sedition is worse than murther; The wicked shall not cease to fight you, until they have, if they can accomplish it, mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

His good works among you, that shall quit his Law, and die an Infidel, shall be vain in this World, and himself be confined in the fire of Hell; Such as believe in God, that separate themselves from the impious, that abandon their Houses for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Divine Majesty, and that fight for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:36900:48"/>
the Faith, hope for his Mercy, he is gracious and merciful. They will enquire of thee concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wine, and Games of hazard; say unto them, that it is in them a very great sin, and yet of Uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to Men; but the evil that they cause, is much greater than the profit they reap. They will demand what they ought to expend in good works; say unto them, what shall remain to you, your own Affairs being done. So God teacheth you his Commandments, peradventure you will call to mind the things of Earth and Heaven. They will enquire concerning Orphans; say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, if their substance be intermingled with your own, do them no wrong, they are your Brethren in God, he knoweth them that do good, and those that do Evil: if it had pleased him, he had detained much more from you, for he is Omnipotent and just. Marry not women that believe in many Gods, until they believe in one sole God; a Slave that is a true Believer, is of more value than a free Infidel, notwithstanding she is beautiful. Infidels shall be summoned to Hell fire, and God calleth men to Paradise, and to his mercy, through his meer good Pleasure, and declareth to them his Commandments, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they will remember them. They will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of thee concerning the Monthly terms of Women; answer, that they are unclean; sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate your selves from your Wives when they are menstruous, and come not nigh them until they be purified; when they shall be clean, approach them, according to what God hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: he loveth them that repent of their Errours, that are clean and purified; your Wives are your Tillage, go to your Tillage at your Pleasure, and do good for your Souls; you shall one day find it, fear God and preach his Commandments
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:36900:49"/>
to the true Believers. Your Religion doth not permit you to swear by God in vain, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to justifie your selves; God understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and knoweth all things, he will not regard what you shall speak at Random, that shall not be hurtful to any, but he will see what it shall be in your heart. He will be gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to such as shall swear, not to touch their Wives for the space of four Months; if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to them, he is gracious and merciful; but if they desire to repudiate them, he understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and knoweth all things. Women divorced, shall tarry until their Terms be past four times, before they Marry again, it is not permitted them to conceal what God hath created in their Womb, if they believe in his divine Majesty, and the Day of Judgment; if they flie from their Husbands, they shall be brought again to them, which is a thing reasonable. They ought to honour them, and their Husbands likewise ought to honour them, but the Husbands have a degree of advantage above them. God is Omnipotent, and most wise in what he ordaineth. Divorce the first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, ought to be performed with mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, courtesie, and good deeds; it is not lawful for you to take any thing from your Wives, of what you have given them, if you both fear a disability of not satisfying the Commandments of God; but if you both fear to transgress the bounds prescribed by God, you shall do well to accord together, such are the commandments of his Divine Majesty, transgress them not, such as trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress them are exceedingly to blame. He that shall have repudiated his Wife thrice, shall not resume her, until she hath
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:36900:49"/>
been married to another that hath divorced her: then they may return to each other, and marry again without Sin, if they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves able to continue within the limits pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by God, which he manifesteth to the wise and prudent. When you shall repudiate your Wives, appoint them the time they must tarry, before they again marry, take them with civility and modesty, and in the like manner dismiss them, give them presents ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your abilities, and take them not, to abuse nor torment them; they that do this, offend their own Souls. Mock not at the Commandments of God: Remember his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and how he hath taught you Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, Knowledge, and the mysteries of his Law; Fear God, and know that he understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all your actions. When you repudiate your Wives, appoint them they ought to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, before they marry again, and hinder them not to marry according to the Commandments of God. These things are preached to them among you that believe in God, and in the Day of Judgment, it is requisite so to make use of them. God knoweth what you know not. The Women shall give suck to their Children two years entire; if they desire to accomplish the time appointed to suckle them, the Father shall nourish and cloath the Wife; and his Children, according to his faculties; expend not, but according to the measure of your goods: the Father and Mother shall not necessitate themselves for their Children: the heir shall perform what is above ordained, (he shall entertain his Father and Mother ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording<note place="margin">See <hi>Gelal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din.</hi>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:36900:50"/>
be expired, they may do it without offending God, if they both agree to it. If you cause your Children to be nursed by other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men than your own Wives, God will not be offended, in giving them their sallary, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to reason and honesty: fear God, and know that he seeth what ever you do. Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows shall tarry four months and ten nights after the death of their Husbands, before they marry again; this time being accomplished, they shall do what shall seem good to them, according to reason and honesty, God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all your actions. You will not offend God in speaking a word in secret to Women that you research in marriage, although you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal in your mind your design to espouse them, he understandeth what ever you think of them; know them not secretly, until you have pronounced the words appointed by the Law; and enter not the bonds of marriage, until the time set down in writing be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, God knoweth whatever is in your hearts: take heed unto your selves, he is gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and gracious to them that fear him. It is no sin to repudiate your Wives, before you have touched them; you shall give them some presents, and do good unto them, according to the proportion of your wealth, or pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and civilly intreat them, as is the custom of honest Men. If you repudiate them before you have touched them, and have bestowed on them any presents of garments, moveables, and other things, they shall have the moity, if they release it not to you, or if the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, remitting with his own hand the tie of marriage, doth not leave to them the whole, of courtesie: it is requisite to gratifie
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:36900:50"/>
them, and to forget nothing of the benefits between you, God beholdeth all your actions: stand upon your guard, when you make your prayers, especially, that at noon, and be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient unto God. If you fear your enemies, and cannot place your selves on your knees, neither perform the Ceremonies that are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed you; omit not to say your prayers on foot, or on horseback, and being freed from fear, remember God, and how he hath taught you what you know not. Such as die, shall be good to their Wives by their Testament; they shall bestow on them where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to live during the time they must tarry before they marry again; drive them not from your houses: If they willingly depart, the sin of what they shall do in their own persons, shall not be upon you. God is Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, and just; you shall likewise do good to your Wives that you have divorced, according to your power, it is a thing reasonable among such as fear God: Thus God teacheth you his Commandments, perhaps you will learn them. See you not them that departed their houses for the fear they had of death? they are thousands in number; God hath said to them, die: after this, he raised them again: God is the Benefactor of the People, but the greatest part return him no thanks for his favours. Fight for his Law, and know, that he understandeth and knoweth all things. Who is he that will afford him a good turn? He will augment him with multiplicity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease; he giveth good, and taketh it away from whom it pleaseth him; you shall all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn before him to be judged. Knowest thou not, that a company of the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:36900:51"/>
after the death of <hi>Moses,</hi> said to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, send us a King, we with him will fight for the Law of God? He answereth them, have you disobeyed the Commandments of God? If they enjoyn you to fight, you will not do it: They said, we have no greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, than to fight for the glory of his Divine Majesty; we for this Cause have abandoned our houses, and those of our Parents: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, when they were commanded to fight, they all, except some few of them, retired; but God knoweth them that sin against him. Their Prophet said to them, God hath sent <hi>Saul</hi> to be your King; they answered, why shall he be our King? we rather deserve the Royalty than he, he is not rich enough; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, God hath chosen him to command you; he hath encreased his knowledge, and Stature, he giveth Royalty to whom he listeth, he is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral and prudent in all his Actions. Their Prophet said to them, the sign of his Reign shall be, that the Ark shall appear to you from God, to confirm your hearts; wherein shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the remainder of what the people of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> left, and it shall be born by Angels; this shall be to you the sign of his Reign, if you believe in God. When <hi>Saul</hi> went forth with his Troops to fight his Enemies, he said, God shall try you by a River; he that shall drink of that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, shall not be mine, unless he drink with his hand; they all, except some few of them drank at their Pleasure; and having past that River with the true Believers, they said, we have not this day strength sufficient to resist <hi>Goliah</hi> and his Troops; but such as believed in God, and feared his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majesty, said, how often, through the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of God, hath a small Troop defeated a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:36900:51"/>
great Army? He is with them that are patient: when they saw <hi>Goliah</hi> with his Troops appear; they said, Lord, give us patience, confirm our steps, and give us Victory over the Infidels. They, through the permission of God, vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed their Enemies; <hi>David</hi> slew <hi>Goliah,</hi> and God<note place="margin">See <hi>Gelal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din.</hi>
                  </note> gave him the Royalty, and knowledge of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture things. Had not God raised the people one against the other, the whole Earth had been full of disorders; such are the Miracles of God, as I declare to thee with truth; thou art indeed one of the Prophets of his Divine Majesty. We have conferred our graces on the Prophets, on some more than on others; many have spoken to their Lord, and some have been more elevated than others. We gave knowledge to Jesus the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> and fortified him through the Holy Spirit. Had it pleased God, the Prophets that came heretofore, had not been slain, after they had taught his Commandments. Men were of different Opinions; some believed in God, others were impious; had it pleased God, they had not been slain, but he doth what pleaseth him. O ye that are true Believers! dispense in Alms some part of your wealth that we have given you, before the day arrive, wherein you shall find no Ransom, Alms, Protection, nor Prayers that can succour you. Certainly Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels are greatly to blame. God! There is but one only God, living and eternal; think not that he slumbereth or sleepeth; whatever is in Heaven or in Earth is his; who shall intercede for thee with his Divine Majesty unless by his permission? He knoweth all the Actions of men, and whatever they have done; they know nothing, but what it hath pleased him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:36900:52"/>
Heaven and Earth, and the Conservation of both is not troublesome to him, he is Omnipotent and glorious. The Law ought not to be abjured, it manifesteth the difference of Faith and Impiety: He that believeth not in <hi>Tagot,</hi> or the Devil, and hath Faith in God, layeth hold on the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est knot, that cannot be dissolved, broken, or cut asunder. God understandeth and knoweth all things; he aideth and assisteth them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in his Unity; he will cause them to come out of darkness, and will guide them into light: the wicked shall have <hi>Tagot,</hi> and the Devil for their Protector; he shall cause them to forsake the light, and shall lead them into darkness: such men shall remain eternally in the fire of Hell.

Hast thou considered the action of him that came into a Village desolate and ruined, and said, How is it that God can be able to give life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Village after it's death, and re-establish it after so great a ruine? Then God caused him to die, after the space of an hundred years raised him again, and said to him, How long hast thou continued here; he answered; I have sojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here a day and a half; On the contrary, thou hast been here an hundred years; consider thy Meat and Drink, that they are not altered through length of time; and behold, thine Ass is dead, see his bones, that are white; thou shalt become
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:36900:52"/>
an example to all the World, and to Posterity; see the bones of thine Ass; I will recollect and revest them with flesh: Seeing this Miracle, he said, I affirm that God is Omnipotent; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thou, that <hi>Abraham</hi> said, Lord shew me how thou revivest the dead; God said, Doest thou not believe my Omnipotency? He answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yea, Lord, but hear my Prayer for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of my heart; God said, Take four Birds, cut them altogether in pieces, and carry the pieces upon those Mountains; this done, call them, they shall speedily return to thee; God knoweth all things, and is most prudent in all his works. The action of them that dispend their Goods for his glory, is like unto a Grain of Corn that produceth seven ears, and every ear an hundred Grains: God multiplieth the wealth of whom it pleaseth him, he is liberal and omniscient: Such as dispend their substance for his glory, without repining, and reproach, shall be recompensed by his Divine Majesty, and be delivered from fear and affliction at the day of Judgment. Good words and pardon are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Almes, followed with repentance: God is most rich and merciful.

God so teacheth you his Mysteries; peradventure you will bear them in mind. Oh ye that believe! dispend in pious works, and give Alms of the wealth you have acquired, and of the Fruits of the Earth that God hath given you; desire not wealth ill got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or wherewith to give Alms; such are not received but to your shame; And know, that God is most rich, and worthy of praise. The Devil will cause you to fear Poverty, and will command you filthiness, and God promiseth to you his Grace and Mercy; he is munificent, and omniscient, he giveth knowledge to whom it pleaseth him, and to whom knowledge is given, on him is bestowed an exceeding great Treasure, which none but the wise do value; God behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth your alms, and vows, and the wicked shall be deprived of protection at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If you suffer your alms to appear, it shall not be amiss; if you conceal them, you shall do well, that will cover many of your sins; God knoweth all your actions. You are not obliged to lead Men into the right way, God guideth whom he listeth; the good and the alms that you perform, shall be for your Souls; give not alms but for the love of God, you shall be rewarded for the good works that you shall do, and no injustice shall be done against you; Be benefactors to the

poor, that are not accommodated for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, and that cannot labour. The ignorant believe them to be rich, by reason of their probity and goodness, you shall know them by their Physiognomy, and in that they demand nothing with importunity; God will know the good you shall do towards them; They that give alms, by day or by night, secretly or publickly, shall be rewarded of God; there needeth be no fear for them, they shall be exempt from affliction at the day of Judgment; Usurers shall rise again, like to Men possessed with Devils, because they have said, that traffick is like unto Usury; God permitteth traffick, and prohibiteth usury; he to whom the word of God cometh, and who hath abandoned Usury, what is past, is to himself, God will pardon his fault; but he that shall return to exercise Usury, having once abandoned it, shall be punished in the fire of Hell; God abhorreth Usury, he loveth them that are alms-givers, and hateth Infidels; Such as believe in God, that do good works, and that make their prayers at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and pay their Tyths, shall be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his Divine Majesty, they shall be delivered from fear and affliction at the day of Judgment. O ye that believe in God! have the fear of him before your eyes, and forsake Usury, if you will obey his Commandments; if you do not this, God and his Prophet will make War upon you; if you be converted, your principal remains unto you; Do injustice to no Man, it shall not be done unto you. If your debtors be unable to pay you, and are in want, you shall do well to stay their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency; if you give them alms, you shall
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:36900:55"/>
do well; fear the day when you shall return before God, and that every one shall be pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without injustice, of what he shall have gained. O ye that believe in God! when you shall charge your selves with any debt, cause an act to be drawn; the Notary shall write the Contract between you, conformable to Justice, and shall not refuse to write it, as God hath instructed him, but the debtor shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely satisfie what he shall owe, and shall have the fear of his Lord before his eyes; if he that is a debtor is a fool, or sick, and is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of himself to discharge it, his Guardian, or he that shall oversee his affairs, shall give satisfaction for him. Call with you two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, if you cannot find two Men, one, with two Women shall suffice, whose testimony you shall accept; if the one be wanting to her duty, the other shall cause her to remember; these witnesses shall not refuse their testimony, notwithstanding they be called in a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Make no difficulty to write your testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, whether it concern little or much, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the time wherein payment ought to be made; such writings are just before God, give more efficacy to testimony, and are requisite to avoid your complaints one of another; If your merchandize be present, you shall take it between you at the same time, then shall you not sin in not drawing a writing, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. Call witnesses when you sell or buy; neither the witnesses, nor the Notary shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any damage; If you shall do that which is forbidden, you shall do very ill: Fear God, he will teach you his Commandments, he knoweth all things.

If one trusteth in the other, he that shall be trusted in, shall satisfie his promise, and fear God his Lord; no Man shall conceal his testimony; he that shall conceal, shall sin in his heart; God knoweth all your actions.

Lord thou art he that shalt assemble the World at the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at which day nothing shall be found doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, when thou wilt not go against thy Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and when wealth and Children shall not serve to the wicked, but to kindle the fire of Hell. The Infidel Lineage of <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and those that preceded him, blasphemed and abjured the Law of God, but he surprized them in their sin; he is grievous in his Chastisements. Say to the Infidels, they shall be vanquished, and shall be

gathered together into the fire of Hell, that is prepared for them. You have an example in the two Troops that fought for the glory of God, they beheld with their eyes, Infidels become true Believers, like unto themselves; God strengtheneth with his Aid, whom it pleaseth him; this shall be for example to such as shall clearly see. The love and desire of Women, of Children, of Riches, abundance of Gold, and of Silver, of Horses, Cattel, and of Tillage, are pleasing to Men; such are the Riches of the life of this World, but the most assured re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge is in God. Say unto them; I will declare unto you things much better for them, that shall have the fear of God before their eyes: they shall dwell eternally in Paradise, where flow ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Rivers, with Women beautiful, and Lean, and all manner of Content. God beholdeth them that adore him, and that say, Lord we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in thy Law, pardon our sins, and deliver us from the torments of Fire. The Patient, the persevering, true Believers, the obedient, the good Men, such as beg Pardon of God in the Morning; the Angels, the Learned, that love Justice, testifie that there is but one only God. The Law of Salvation, is a Law pleasing to his Divine Majesty; no man contradicteth this Truth, among <note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Christians.</hi> See <hi>Gelal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din.</hi> The <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi>

Declare grievous torments to those that conceal his Commandments, that kill the Prophets, and injure them that instruct the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Justice; the good Works that they do, shall be unprofitable to them on Earth, and they shall be in the other World deprived of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. Seest thou not a party of them that know the written Law, how they were called to a Lecture of the Book of God, to the end they might judge with Equity the differences that are among them? but many are returned to their sin: they contemned the Scripture, in that they said, the fire shall not touch us, but for a certain number of days; They are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in their blasphemies, what will become of them, when we shall assemble them at the day of Judgment, when nothing shall be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and every one shall be recompensed, as he shall have merited? No injustice shall be done unto them. Say, Lord, thou possessest the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the World, thou givest Royalty to whom thou seest good; from thy hand, O Lord, proceedeth all good, thou art Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, thou causest day to enter the night, and night the day; thou causest life to come out of death, and death out of life; thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richest without measure whom thou seest good. The Believers shall not obey the unbelievers, to the exclusion of true Believers; he that doth this thing, observeth not the law of God; but if you fear your Enemies, God willeth that you fear him also, he is the assured refuge of the righteous; say to them whether you conceal what is in your heart, or whether you manifest i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I will teach him the Scriptures, the Mysteries of the Law, the Old Testament, and the Gospel, and he shall be a Prophet sent to the Children of <hi>Israel.</hi> Jesus said to the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> I come to you with evident signs of my mission from your Lord, I will make unto you of the slime of the Earth, the figure of a Bird, I will blow upon it, incontinently it shall be a Bird, and by the permission of God, shall flie; I will heal them that are born blind, and the leprous, I will raise again the dead, I will teach you what you shall eat, and what you ought not to eat; this shall serve you for instruction, if you believe in God; I am come to confirm the Old Testament, and what hath been taught you heretofore. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is lawful for you to eat things that have been heretofore forbidden. I am come to you with signs of my mission, that testifie that I am truly sent from your Lord; fear God, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey me, God is my Lord, and your Lord, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him, this is the right way. When Jesus knew their impiety, he said, Who shall sustain the Law of God in my absence? The Apostles answered him, we will substain the Law of God, we believe in his unity; be thou a witness before God, that we resign our selves wholly to the pleasure of his Divine Majesty. Lord we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in what thou hast commanded, and we have followed the Prophet, thy Apostle, write us in the number of them that profess thy Law. The <hi>Iews</hi> conspired against Jesus, and God caused their conspiracy to turn against them, he knoweth the designs of Conspirators. Remember thou, how the Lord said, O Jesus, I will cause thee to die, I will elevate thee to my self, and remove thee far from Infidels, and prefer those that have

obeyed thee, to Infidels, at the day of Judgment. That day shall assemble you all before me; I will judge the differences between you, and will punish the impious, in this World, and in the other; none among them shall be of power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them, I will reward them that shall have believed in my Law, and have done good works; God loveth not the unjust. I relate to thee these mysteries, and teach thee the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran;</hi> Jesus is with God, as is <hi>Adam,</hi> God created him of the Earth; he said, Be thou, and he was: this truth proceedeth from thy Lord, be not thou of the number of them that doubt; If any one dispute with thee concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy Doctrine, say to them, Come, call to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether your Children and ours, your Wives and ours, let us assemble and address our prayers to God; I will lay the curse of his Divine Majesty upon lyers. This Discourse is most true, there is no God, but God alone the Omnipotent, and Wise.

O ye that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand Scripture, dispute not the Law of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> to wit, if he observed the Old Testament, or the Gospel, they were taught after him, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you will acknowledge your error. Oh ye that have disputed what you knew not! <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was no <hi>Iew,</hi> nor Christian, he professed the unity of God, he was a true believer, and

not of the number of Infidels: The People, and particularly those that followed him, of his time, as also the Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and all true believers have known the truth of his Law. Part of them, to whom heretofore was given the knowledge of Scripture desired, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced you from the right way, but they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves erred, and they knew it not. O ye that know the Scripture! do not maliciously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the Commandments of God, cover not the Truth with a lye, neither willingly hide it. Many of them that knew the written Law, said, From the break of day, believe in what hath been taught them, that believe in the Law of God: Nevertheless, at evening, they were themselves of the number of Infidels, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture they will be converted. Believe not, but such as follow your own Law; Say to them, The true guide, is the guide of God. The knowledge that was given to you, was not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to any other, but to you: If the Infidels shall dispute against you, before your Lord, at the day of Judgment; say to them, Grace proceedeth from the hand of God: He is bountiful, and omniscient; he pardoneth whom he pleaseth, and is altogether merciful. If thou intrustest thy wealth to the hands of many of them that know the written Law, they will faithfully restore it to thee: There be also ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them that will not restore it, if thou take not heed; because they have said, They have no belief in the <hi>Arabians,</hi> they blaspheme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, and know their blasphemies. He that shall satisfie what he hath promised, and shall fear God, shall be beloved of God; he loveth such as have fear of him before their eyes; such as pervert his Commandments for

any profit, shall have no part in Paradise; he will not protect them, neither regard, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them at the day of Judgment; and they shall be rigorously punished. There be of them, that alter the Scripture in reading it, and will make believe that what they read, is in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, although it be not; they blaspheme, and know it well. God gave not to Man the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, knowledge, and prophecies, to say to the People, Worship me instead of God; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to say, Observe exactly what you have learned in Scripture, and what you read. God doth not command you to adore Angels, nor Prophets: Will he command you impiety, having instructed you in his Law?

O ye that believe, if you obey many of them that have the knowledge of the written Law, they will mis-lead you into the number of the wicked. How can you be of the impious, since you are taught the Commandments of God, and that his Prophet, and his Apostle is among you? He that resigneth himself to God, is in the right way. O ye that fear God, die in the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Unity, imbrace his Law, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the favour he hath shewed you: you were all enemies of each other; he hath united your hearts, and through his special Grace you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued united to each other as good Brethren: you were upon the brink of a pit of fire, from which he withdrew you.

from what is unreasonable; these Men shall be happy: Be not like them that have abandoned the Truth, and followed lies; notwithstanding the Truth was known to them, they shall suffer great torment in the day wherein the visage of the good shall be white, and that of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed shall be black.

They shall not hurt you, but with their tongue, and shall find no protection against you; if they fight you, they shall turn their backs; they were beaten with shame and ignominy, where they made a stand, except, when they embraced the Law of God, and observed the precepts that were taught the faithful: When they returned in the wrath of God, they were beaten with poverty; because they believed not the word of his Divine Majesty, but slew his Prophets without reason, and disobeyed his Commandments. They that heretofore had

knowledge of the written Law, are not all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: there be among them that persevered in obedience, and in the night meditate on the miracles of God, worship him, and believe in his Divine Majesty, and the Day of Judgment; preach honesty, prohibit to do things disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and apply themselves to good works; certainly, they are good Men. Hide not the good works which you perform, God knoweth such as have his fear before their eyes. Riches and Children shall be unprofitable to Infidels with God, they shall eternally dwell in the fire of Hell: The Alms that they give in this World, are like to a Wind exceeding hot, or extreamly cold, that fell upon the Tillage of them that did injury to their own Souls, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destroyed it. God did no injustice to them, they were mischievous to themselves through their sins. O ye that believe in God, esteem no man to be elected of God, that is not of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: The wicked endeavoured to bring you into their disorders, malice appeared in their mouth, and that which their heart che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth, is yet greater: We have taught you the Commandments of God; if you observe them, you shall protect your selves from the malice of Infidels. O ye! you love them, and they love not you; you believe generally in the Scriptures, and they believe not what you believe: When they met you, they said, We believe in God; and when they were gone from you, they bit for anger their Fingers ends: Say to them, Die with your Choler, God knoweth what is in your hearts. If good happen to you, they are displeased; and when evil befalleth you, they rejoyce: If you have patience, and fear God, their malice shall not hurt you; God

Say to the true Believers, sufficeth it not, that God succoureth you with three thousand of his Angels: Truly, if you have patience, and fear God, he will come to succour you at need, and your Lord will assist you with five thousand of his Angels sent from Heaven; he will not send you this assistance but to declare to you his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and to confirm your hearts. Victory proceedeth from his Divine Majesty: He is Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, and prudent in all his works; he will extirpate in this World one part of the wicked, or will so sharply reprehend them, that they shall become desperate. Thou hast nothing to do, whether he shall pardon, or chastise them, because they are wicked: Whatever is in the Earth, and in Heaven, is his, he pardoneth as he seeth good; he is gracious and merciful to the righteous. O ye that believe! be not U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers, and fear God; peradventure you will obey his Commandments; Fear the fire of Hell prepared for Infidels. Obey God, and the Prophets, his Apostles, your sins shall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given you; beg pardon speedily of your Lord. The extent of Paradise containeth Heaven and Earth; it is prepared for the good. God lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them that give Alms in joy, and in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that subdue their Passion, and forgive such as offend them: he loveth them that do good, and that after the Commission of any sin, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member

his Divine Majesty, and implore his Pardon. Who but God forgiveth sins? Such as persist not in their Errours, and acknowledge their sins, shall be recompensed with the mercy of God, and enjoy his favour in Paradise. There were heretofore Laws and Means to conduct men into the right way; but consider what hath been the end of Infidels. The <hi>Alcoran</hi> was sent to instruct the World, to guide men in the right way, and to preach to the good. Dishearten not, neither afflict your selves in fighting; you shall be Victorious if you believe in God; if you have been wounded, the like hurts have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faln the impious. God so diversifieth days a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, to the end he may know them that are truly zealous in his Law; and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, Witnesses be taken against the malice of Infidels. God loveth not the unjust, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveth sins to those that believe, and extirpate Infidels. Do you believe to enter Paradise, and that God knoweth not them that fought gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly?

                  </note> and Apostle of God; there were many Prophets before him; when they died, or were slain, you returned upon your steps to impiety: They that return upon their steps, do no harm to God; he will reward only such as acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his favours; and men cannot die without his permission, and that in a time prescribed and predestinate. I will give the good things of this World to whom it pleaseth me, and will abundantly recompence them that praise me. How many Prophets, and men with them, that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:36900:64"/>
were not dejected through their afflictions that befel them, in fighting for the Law of God? They were not weakned, neither humbled to the Infidels. God affecteth them that are patient in their adversities, and such as persevere in his Law. They said in their afflictions, Lord par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don our sins, confirm our steps, and protect us against the Infidels. God giveth them the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Earth, and the Treasures of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; he loveth them that do good. O ye that believe in God, if you obey the wicked, they will cause you to return upon your steps, you shall return to the number of the damned; truly God is your Lord, he is the best Protector; I will put fear into the hearts of Infidels, because they have without reason adored many Gods, and the fire of Hell shall be their habitation. God hath made the truth of his Promises to appear to you, when by his permission you slew the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, until you were weary of fighting; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless you contradicted what the Prophet ordained, you disobeyed him, after he had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed you to see what you desired with affection. There be among you that covet the Goods of this World, and others that love the good things of Heaven; God hath withdrawn you from the Infidels, to try you, he hath pardoned your sins, he is bountiful to them that observe his Commandments. When you retreated from the Combat, and yielded without reason, the Prophet recalled you, and gave you to know your Errour, with a thousand pains; afflict not your selves with the loss of the spoil that escaped you at the day of Victory, neither with the mischief that befel you when you were vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, God knoweth all your Actions. After your Labour, he sent you great repose, part of you
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36900:65"/>
slept in all safety, and the residue suffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be carried away at their Pleasures, they had thoughts of God contrary to the truth. Think on the ignorant, that say, Have we seen any of the succour that God hath promised? Say to them, all things proceed from God. They conceal in their Souls what they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish not, and say, had we been free of our own Wills, we had not been slain; say to them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you had stayed in your Houses, and in your B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

O ye that believe! be not like the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, that said, speaking of their Brethren that were slain in the Army; that had they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in their Houses, they had not dyed; God putteth this sorrow in their heart, because of their impiety; he giveth life and death, and beholdeth all your Actions; if you be slain for his Law, or die in his favour, it shall be more advantagious to you than all the Treasures of the World; and if you dye, or be slain, fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Faith, you shall appear before his Divine Majesty to be rewarded: Through the grace of God thou hast rendred them docile; although thou be severe to them, they will not depart from thee, pardon them, pray for them.

It is not Lawful for the Prophet to deceive; he that shall be a deceiver, shall appear at the Day of Judgment with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, to be judged; then shall men be payed with what they have gained, no injustice shall be done to them that shall have loved God, and Hell shall be the habitation of them, that through deceit shall return in the displeasure of his Divine Majesty; They shall not be all equally entreated, God shall appoint them their Rank and place, he beholdeth all their Actions, he assuredly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded the true Believers, when he sent them a Prophet of their own Nation to preach to them his Commandments, and instruct them in the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> they before his coming were in a manifest Errour: When any mischief befel you, it also befel the Infidels; you have demanded, when doth this mischief come? it proceedeth from your selves, certainly God is Omnipotent. What befel you when the two Camps encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, hapned through the permission of God, to distinguish the true Believers, that dispense their Goods with affection for the glory of his Divine Majesty, from them that abandoned the fight; when it was said to them, Come, fight for the Faith, and answered, had we thought of fighting, we had not followed you; then were they nearer to impiety, than to the Faith; nevertheless, they had not all of them that in their heart, that was in their mouth, God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what they keep secret: There be of them that said to their Brethren; Stay, and go not to the Combat; your Companions had not been slain, had they obeyed us; say to them, Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your selves from death, if you can avoid it,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:36900:66"/>
continuing in your Houses. Believe not that those that were slain for the Faith are dead: on the contrary, they are alive with God; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, for that such as ran to hinder them to fight, did not meet them; fear not for them, they shall rejoyce eternally in the favour of God, he will abundantly reward them that fight for his Law. Those that obeyed God and the Prophet, after being overcome, that did good works, and feared his Divine Majesty, shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive great rewards. When it was told them, the people have conspired against you, take heed to your selves; this Discourse increased their Faith; and they said, it sufficeth that God is our Protector, they were filled with the grace of God, no more evil befel them, and they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the Commandments of his Divine Majesty. He is gracious to them that obey him. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil will cause in you a fear of the Infidels, fear them not; but if you be good men, fear me. Afflict not your selves to see the wicked run to impiety, they hurt not God, he will not give them rest in the other World, where they shall be severely chastised. I increase the wealth of Infidels to augment their pain, they shall in the end feel grievous torments. God will not leave the faithful in the state that you are in; he will one day separate the good from the evil; he doth not teach you what is to come; he, for that effect chuseth among the Prophets whom he seeth good. Believe therefore in God, and his Prophets; if you believe in God, fear to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him, you shall be rewarded. Believe that such as are too sparing, and avaritious of the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wealth that God hath given them, do well; on the contrary, they do very ill, what they spare without reason, shall strangle them at the day of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:36900:66"/>
Judgment. The inheritance of Heaven and Earth is Gods, he knoweth all things. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God heard the Speech of them that said, God is poor, and we are rich; he hath said, I will write what they have spoken, and keep an exact account of the Murther they have unjustly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the Persons of the Prophets; I will say to them at the day of Judgment, taste of the torments of Hell fire, which you have deserved. God doth not lead into darkness them that worship him. There be that say, God hath commanded us not to believe the Prophets, until their Sacrifice be consumed by fire: Say to them, there came to you Prophets heretofore with Miracles that you demanded, you had not slain them, had you been righteous; if they belye thee, know, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed the Prophets that were before thee, that came with Miracles, the Psalter, and the Book of Light. Every man shall taste of death, and your reward shall be payed at the Day of Judgment; he that shall depart from the fire of Hell, and enter into Paradise, shall be happy. The wealth of this World is but matter of Pride, that you may be tryed in your Riches and Persons. Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken not to the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi> that have known the written Law before you, neither to them that believe in many Gods, they offend God through their blasphemies; if you have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and fear God, you shall make a very good resolution. God hath accepted the Speech of them that know his written Law, when they promised him to preach to the people his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and not conceal them; nevertheless they have contemned them, and changed them for profit of little value, and have gained nothing but misery; think not that such as rejoyce of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil they have done, and affect to be commended
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:36900:67"/>
for what they have not done, have escaped the punishment of their Crimes, they shall certainly suffer great torments. The Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and of the Earth is Gods, he is Omnipotent; the Creation of Heaven and Earth, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of day and night are evident signs of his Omnipotency, to such as have judgment. Such as have, remember God, standing, sitting, or lying down, and considered the Creation of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, have said, Lord, thou hast not created these things in vain; blessed be thy Name, deliver us from the torments of Hell fire, thou wilt render miserable him that thou shalt thither precipitate, and the wicked shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of protection at the Day of Judgment. Lord, we have heard them that say, Believe in your Lord, we believe in thy unity, pardon our faults, blot out our sins, and give us grace to die in the number of the just; bestow on us what thou hast promised by the Prophets, and suffer us not to be miserable at the Day of Judgment; thou dost not contradict what thou dost promise. The Lord heard them, and said to them, I will not suffer your works to be lost, as well of Men as of Women. I will blot out the sins of them that went out of <hi>Mecca,</hi> to separate themselves from the wicked; I will cover the offences of them that forsook their Houses, that assembled to fight for the Faith, and were slain; I will open to them the Gate of Paradise, wherein flow many Rivers, to recompence their good works. There is with God great reward: en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy not the Infidels, whom thou shalt see possess a little wealth in the Earth, Hell is prepared to be their habitation; and such as fear God shall dwell eternally in Gardens, wherein run many
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:36900:67"/>
Rivers, with all manner of content. God is a great rewarder of the just. Among them that know the written Law, there be, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God, in what was afore time taught you, and in what was preached to them, surely they obey God, and forsake not his Law: They shall receive a great reward from God, he is exact in his account. O ye that are true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, be patient in your adversities, persevere to do well, fight for the Faith, fear God, and you shall be happy.</p>

Give to Women their Dowry with a good will; if they give to you any thing that is pleasing to you, receive it with affection, and

Bestow not on fools the wealth that God hath given you for subsistence; assist Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans, give to them the Garments that shall be necessary for them, and entertain them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly; instruct them until they have attained to years of discretion, and are capable of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; if you believe they demean themselves wisely, restore to them their faculties, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them not unjustly before they be of age.

The Children shall have a good part of what their Father, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Parents left after their decease, of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or of much, there appertaineth to them a portion prefixed and limited.

You understand not to whom it is most requisite to do good, to your Children, or to your Father and Mother, give them their Portion ordained of God. The moity of what their Wives shall leave belongeth to you, if they have no Children; if they have, you shall have the fourth part of what they shall leave, after payment of the Legacies and debts; they shall have the fourth of your succession, if you have no Children; if you have, they shall have the eight portion. If a Man or Woman be the heirs of each other, and have neither Father nor Mother, nor Children, and have a Brother or Sister, each of them shall have a sixth part of the succession; if they be more, they shall share the third, after payment of Legacies and debts, without fraud, following what God hath ordained, he knoweth all your actions, and is prudent in what he ordaineth, it is so ordained by his Divine Majesty. He that shall obey him, and his Prophet, shall enter into Paradise, where many Rivers flow, and shall dwell in eternal fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity; he that shall disobey God and his Prophet, shall be cast headlong into the fire of Hell, where he shall suffer ignominious torments. If your Wives commit adultery, take four wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of their fault, that be of your Religion; if they bear witness, keep them prisoners in your Houses until death, or until God shall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise ordain; punish Whoremongers, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines, and Adulterers; if they repent of their fault, do them no harm, God is gracious and merciful to them that repent.

O ye that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God! it is not lawful for you to inherit what is your Wives by force, take not violently away what you have given them, unless they be surprized in manifest adultery; see them with civility, if you have an aversion from them, it may chance that you hate a thing, wherein God hath placed much good; but if they desire to repudiate your Wives, to take others, and that you have given them any thing, take not any thing that appertaineth to them. Will you take their wealth with a lie, and a manifest sin? How shall you take it, since you have approached each other, and that you have promised to use them civilly? Marry not the Wives of your Fathers; what is past was incest, abomination, and a wicked way. Your Mothers are forbidden you, your Daughters, Sisters, Aunts, Nieces, your Nurses, and your Foster-sisters, the Mothers of your Wives, the Daughters that your Wives have had by other Husbands, of whom you shall have a particular care: The Daughters of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that you shall have known, are also for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden you; if you have not known them, it will be no sin: the Wives of your Sons are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise prohibited, and two Sisters; for what is past, God is gracious and merciful: Married Wives are likewise forbidden you, except the women Slaves, that you shall have acquired. God hath so commanded you, except what is above forbidden, it is lawful for you to marry at your Pleasure. If you desire women for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and neither commit Concubinage, nor A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, give them their Salary for which you shall agree, so you shall not offend God, he is

Omniscient, and most Wife. He that shall not be able to espouse women of Free-condition, shall marry such women or maids, that are Slaves, as shall please him. God knoweth the Faith of the one, and other. Marry your Wives with the permission of their Parents, and give them their Dowry with honesty: If women of Free-condition, that have committed neither Concubinage, nor Adultery, secretly nor pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, flie into second Nuptials, and come to commit Adultery, they shall be doubly punished, more than the Daughters of Love.

God is gracious and merciful; he is willing to teach you his Law, and direct you in the way of them that preceded you; he is gracious and merciful to his people. Such as follow the Appetite of the wicked, decline extreamly from the Truth. God willeth that his Law be Light unto you, for that man was created weak.

If you depart from mortal sins, I will cover your Faults, and cause you to enter into Paradise: covet not through Envy, what God hath given to your Neighbour; men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men shall have the wealth they have gained; beg Grace of God, he knoweth all things. Give to your Associates what appertaineth to them. We have ordained a Portion, prefixt to the one and the other, in the succession of your

Father, Mother, and Kindred, God seeth all. The men shall have Authority over the women; they shall have them in their keeping; they shall have in their power the wealth that God shall give them; and shall have care of what shall be convenient to be expended for them. Discreet and obedient Wives observe, in the absence of their Husbands, the Commandments of God, make Remonstrances to them that shall be disobedient, and remove them from your Bed, chastise them. If they obey you, seek not occasion to abuse them unjustly. God is most high, and most mighty. If you fear there may happen some difference between a Man and his Wife, send to them some of their Kindred, to put an end to their Quarrel, and reconcile them. God will give his Peace to them, he is Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scient. Worship God, and say not that he hath a Companion equal to him; do good to your Father, and Mother, your Kindred, Orphans, the Poor, your Neighbours, Pilgrims, your Friends, and your Slaves. God loveth not the Proud. We have prepared rigorous torments for them that are avaricious, that recommend Avarice to the people, that conceal the Graces that God hath bestowed on them, and that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious. Such as dispend their wealth with Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, believe neither in God, nor the Day of Judgment; and those that shall have the Devil for their Companion, will be in exceeding bad Company; he shall not approach them, if they believe in God, and the Day of Judgment, and give in Alms some part of the Riches God hath given them. God knoweth them, and doth no injustice to any one, of the weight of a small Ant. If the righteous do good of the quantity of a Pismire, God shall multiply it, and give
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:36900:70"/>
them a great reward. In what condition will Infidels be at the Day of Judgment; for that we have Witnesses of all Nations against their impiety; and that we will call thee for a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness against them of their Deportments? That day, the Infidels that have disobeyed the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, shall desire to be consumed, like to the Earth; and not to have concealed or altered, through their Discourse, the Commandments of God. O you that believe, make not your Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, being drunk, until you know what you speak; neither likewise being polluted, unless in passing on the way, until you be cleansed; if you be in a journey, or sick, or go to discharge your Belly, or have known your Wives, and find no water to wash you, you shall lay hand upon the Sand, and wipe your Face and Hands. God is gracious and merciful to his Creatures. Seest thou not how those that know the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Law, purchase Errour? how they desire to mis-lead you through their Riches, and divert you from the right way? God knoweth your Enemies, it is enough that he is your defender and Protector. Such as <hi>Iudaize,</hi> alter the word of God, and say to the Prophet, we have heard, and disobeyed thee, they heard without hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; they say, preserve us, have care of us; nevertheless do they pervert the word of God; in reading it, and alter his Commandments; they should do better to say, Lord we have heard, and obeyed; hearken only to us, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard us: But God hath cursed them, and few of them will believe in his Divine Majesty.

I will curse Infidels, as I have cursed them of the Sabbath; the Commandment of God is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently executed; he pardoneth not them that associate him with Companions equal to him, except this, he forgiveth sins to whom it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him: He that saith, God hath Companions, blasphemeth, and mortally sinneth. Consider not such as affirm themselves to be good Men; contrariwise, God maketh those good Men that please him; no injustice shall befal them at the Day of Judgment. Consider how they blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, it is sufficient that God manifestly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth their sin. Seest thou not them that have knowledge of the written Law, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in <hi>Habot</hi> and <hi>Tagot,</hi> Idols; that say to the Infidels, Behold the way of them that believe in God? Certainly, God hath cursed them; he, whom he curseth, shall find none to protect him. Shall they alone have part in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, without giving Alms? They will envy their Neighbour, for the favours God hath conferred on him. Certainly, we gave to the posterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the knowledge of the Scriptures, and Prophecies; we bestowed on them great abundance of wealth. There were of them that believed in the Scripture, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that contemned it; but they shall be punished in the fire of Hell.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:36900:71"/>
among your selves, to render faithfully what hath been intrusted to you; and when you shall judge differences that shall happen among the people, judge with Equity. It is a good work that he commandeth you; he beholdeth, and knoweth all things. O ye that believe! obey God, and the Prophets, and such as command over you; if you be in Controversie concerning any point, refer it to God, and his Prophet, to understand the Exposition; if you believe in God, and the Day of Judgment, you shall do well: this will be the best Interpretation that you can attain to. Seest thou not, that they who think to believe in what hath been inspired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and what hath been inspired into thy Predecessors, incline to dispute before <hi>Tagot?</hi> Nevertheless, they have commanded not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in that Idol; the Devil laboureth to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, and withdraw them from the Truth. When it was said to them, Obey the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and his Prophet, they departed from thee: What will they do, when there shall happen to them any punishment of their past sins? They will return to thee, and swear by the name of God, That they desire Peace, and to do good Works; but God knoweth what is in their hearts, and hath abandoned them. Cease not to preach to them, and to declare to them the Word of God; the Prophets, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were not sent, but to preach, and to be heard through the permission of his Divine goodness. If, when they have hurt their Souls, they come to thee, and demand pardon of God, thou shalt beg pardon for them, they shall find God gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and merciful: They will not believe in his Divine Majesty, until they have disputed the difference with thee, that is among them;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:36900:72"/>
and when they shall no more doubt of what thou shalt have done, they will without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction obey thee. We have ordained them to kill each other, and to forsake their Houses; they have not done it, except very few of them: and although they did it, they did it not, to obey what should have been to them a great benefit, and exceeding merit; we had given them very great reward, and guided them to the right way. He that shall obey God, and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, shall be with them whom God hath endued with his Grace: He that knoweth it, resigneth himself to his Divine Majesty. O you that are true Believers! be upon your Guard, assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to fight stoutly for the Law of God. There be among you that be Cowardly, when any discomfiture hath befaln you; they have said, God protected me, that I was not with them: And when God gave you Victory, they spake as if there had been no understanding between them and you. Would to God I had been with them, I should have acquired exceeding great merit. Fight for the glory of God, against them that prefer the life of this World, to that of Heaven. I will give an exceeding great reward to such as shall fight, that shall be Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious, and to them that shall be slain, fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Faith. Wherefore fight you not for the Law of God? for the liberty of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children, weak and afflicted, that cry, Lord deliver us out of this place; the people<note place="margin">This place is <hi>Mecca.</hi>
                  </note> thereof are unjust, give us a Protector, give us an assured refuge. They that believe in God fight for his Law, and Infidels fight for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. Fight against them that serve the Devil, his Policies are weak. Consider those to whom it was said, Cease to imbrue your hands in the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:36900:72"/>
Blood of Infidels, persevere in your Prayers, and pay Tithes. When they were commanded to fight, part of them were afraid of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as of God, yea, more afraid of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude than of God, and said, Lord thou hast not enjoyned us to fight, unless thou hast dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered us to a near end. Say to them, The wealth of the Earth is but a small thing, there be great Riches in the other World, for him that shall have the fear of God before his eyes. No injustice shall be done to you; wheresoever you are, death will meet you, notwithstanding you may be in strong Citadels. If good happen to the Infidels, they say it proceedeth from God; if evil befal them, they say, that cometh from thee. Say to them, All proceedeth from God, what then is the Will of those Men? they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend this Discourse: The good that happeneth to you, cometh from God, and the evil that befalleth you, is of your selves. We have sent thee to the people, to teach them the Mysteries of my Law; it is sufficient that I am witness. He that obeyeth the Prophet, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle of God, obeyeth God; if they be diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, thou art not sent to be their Tutor. They say, They will obey thee, and when they are gone from thee, many of them ponder in their heart other things than they have spoken, but God shall write their thoughts, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them. Resign thy self to God, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that he is thy Protector. Will they not meditate on the <hi>Alcoran?</hi> Were it sent from any but from God, there would be therein many Contradictions. When they had any assurance of Victory, or feared to be overcome, they published it, although they had referred all to the Prophet, to the most knowing among them,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:36900:73"/>
and to them that obeyed the Prophet, who knew what ought to be published, and what to be kept secret. If the grace of God had not been with you, and his mercy, you had follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Devil. Fight for the Law of God, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy<note place="margin">See <hi>Kitab el tenoir.</hi>

When you are saluted, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the salute with Honour and Affection, God putteth all in Account.

Had it pleased God, he had given them advantage over you, and they had beaten you, if they depart from you, and follow your Religion, God permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not you to do them injury. You shall find some that shall incline to believe you, and their companions, they will turn all to confusion, and fall into it themselves: if they separate
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:36900:73"/>
themselves from you, if they desire not peace of you, and desist not to do you mischief, take and kill them, where you find them, we have given you absolute power over them. One true believer ought not to slay another true believer, unless it be through ignorance; He that shall slay a true believer through ignorance, shall redeem from slavery a true believer, or shall pay damages and interests to the Kindred and Heirs of the Dead, if they through courtesie discharge him not of them: If he be of your enemies, and a true believer, he shall ransom from captivity a true believer; If he be of your confederates, he shall pay damages and interests to the Kindred and Heirs of the Dead, and redeem from Captivity a true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; If he shall be destitute of means to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this, he shall fast two Months together for a penance appointed of God; God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things, and is prudent in what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth. He that shall kill a true believer of deliberate purpose, shall be chastised in the fire of Hell, the wrath of God, and his curse shall be upon him eternally. O ye! who are true believers, when you fight against Infidels for the Law of God, cause your selves to be known, and say not to them that salute you, Thou art not a true believer; If you desire the good things of the World, God possesseth riches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable, you were before like to them, but God hath given you grace, and seeth all your actions. The faithful that continue in their Houses without sickness, are not equal in merits to such as imploy their persons and faculties for the Law of God; he preferreth by many degrees, them that fight for his Law, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their wealth and persons for his service; to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:36900:74"/>
those that remain idle in their Houses, he is their protector, and hath prepared for them a sure refuge in Paradise: he gratifieth by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of favour, them that fight for his Law, above those that live at ease in their Houses, he is gracious and merciful. The Angel said to the Infidels that they put to death, Where were you with your Religion? they answered, We were weak and impotent in the City of <hi>Mecca;</hi> they said, Was not the Earth large enough for you to depart from the wicked? Hell shall be their habitation, except the Women and Children that were weak and impotent; peradventure God will pardon them, he is gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful; he that shall depart from the wicked, to follow his Law, shall find many places fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to him, assuredly he will recompense him that shall quit his House, that shall be slain for his glory, and to follow his Prophet, he is gracious and merciful. When you shall be in a journey, you shall not offend God to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge your prayers, that the Infidels may not surprize you, they are your declared Enemies; when thou shalt be near them, and shalt appoint the true believers to make their prayers, keep about thee a party of them for a guard, while the residue make their prayers; having finished their Orisons, they shall do as the first; take Arms and keep a guard, during the time their Companions shall make their prayers: the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels desire that you quit your Arms to surprize you; you shall not do amiss to quit them, if Rain trouble you, or you be sick, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue always upon your guard, God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for Infidels ignominious torments: Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving finished your prayers, Remember God, standing, sitting or lying down, and pray when
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:36900:74"/>
you shall be in a place of safety; prayer is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the faithful in a prefixed and appointed time. Be not negligent to pursue the Infidels, if you suffer, they shall suffer like you; but you hope for that which they must not hope for: God knoweth all their actions, he is most pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in all his works. We have sent to thee the most true Book, to the end, thou mayst judge the differences that are among the People, as thy Lord hath instructed thee. Contend not with Traitors, and ask pardon of God, he is gracious and merciful. Dispute not with those that betray their Souls, God loveth not treacherous sinners, they conceal themselves from the World, he is with them when they hide in their hearts such things as are displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to him, he knoweth all their actions: O ye! you dispute for them in this World, who shall dispute for them against God at the day of Judgment? Who shall that day be their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector?

God pardoneth not them that say, He hath Companions, except this, he pardons all things as he seeth good: he that affirmeth that God hath a Companion, greatly erreth, and is estranged from the truth. If they invoke other than God, they invoke Idols, the Devil, obstinate, and cursed of God; when he said to him, Thou wilt not give me power over them that worship thee, but I will seduce them from the right way, I will prolong their wicked life, to retard their conversion, I will cause them to cut off the <note n="*" place="margin">The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> cut off the ear of any beast, and gave him liberty through their Country for expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their sins.

God is most true in what he promiseth, who is more than God in his words? Your lies, and the lies of them that know the written Law, do him no harm; he that shall do ill, shall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and shall find no protector; he that shall do well, and shall believe in the Law of God, shall enter into Paradise, and shall have no injustice done to him; what better Law is there, than to resign thy self to God, and to be an honest Man? Follow the Law of <hi>Abraham;</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:36900:75"/>
God chose <hi>Abraham,</hi> to love him; whatsoever is in Heaven and in Earth, belongeth to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majesty, he knoweth all things. They will question thee concerning Women; say to them, God teacheth you in that, what you were taught in the Scripture touching Orphans, and Women; give to them what is appointed by the Law, and desire not to espouse them, only to possess their wealth; God teacheth you likewise to give to Orphans what appertaineth to them, and not to injure them; he will understand your good actions. If a Woman fear to be ill entreated by her Husband, and that he will divorce her, they shall do well, mutually to accord, for peace is exceeding good. If you be too ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate, and cannot agree together; if you do good to your Wives in divorcing them, and fear to wrong them, God will take notice of your actions. If you believe you cannot keep equality, and justice among your Wives, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you apply your selves to it; Incline not altogether to your own appetites, and leave not your Wife, as a thing left in toleration. If you live in a good accord, and fear to injure them, God will be merciful to you. If they se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate themselves conformably to the precepts of the Law, God will enrich them with his protection, he is bountiful and wise, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is in Heaven and Earth obeyeth him. We have recommended to you the fear of God, as we have heretofore, to them that had knowledge of the written Law. If you be impious, know, that whatever is in Heaven and Earth is Gods; he hath no need of his Creatures, and must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, it sufficeth thee, he is thy Protector. If he will, he can cause you to perish, and put o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures in your place, for he is Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.

He that loveth the good things of the Earth, shall find in God all the wealth of this World, and of the other, he understandeth and seeth all things. O you that believe! be true in your Testimonies, notwithstanding it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst your selves, against your Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and against your Kindred, and consider the rich no more than the poor, God is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of the one, and the other; follow not your Appetites, to favour the rich more than the poor, pervert not the Truth, be not scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous to testifie what you know, God knoweth all your Actions. O ye that believe in God! and his Prophet, and the Book that was sent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; know, he that blasphemeth against his Divine Majesty, against his Angels, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, the Prophets, and life eternal, greatly erreth, and departeth from the Truth. God pardoneth not them that have embraced his Law, and then have forsaken it, having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in his Divine Majesty, and are returned again to their impiety; declare to such men, they shall feel heavy torments. Such as obey Infidels, to be great in this World, extreamly delude themselves; greatness proceedeth from God; It is written in the Book that was sent to you, that the Infidels shall mock you, when they shall hear the word of God, and you shall obey his Commandments; Tarry not in their Company, if they change not their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, otherwise you will be like to them, God will assemble into the fire of Hell all Infidels, and wicked Persons. Some of them that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve your Actions, said, they were of your party, when any Felicity hapned to you; and when the Infidels had advantage over you, they said, they were with them, and that they fought
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:36900:76"/>
against you; God at the Day of Judgment shall judge the difference that is between you, and will not give advantage to Infidels, over them that observe his Law. The wicked think to deceive God, but God deceiveth them, they are negligent to make their prayers, they are hypocrites before the World, and remember not his Divine Majesty, except very few of them, uncertain whether they should follow the faithful, or the Infidels; he whom God shall cause to go astray, shall not find the right way. O ye that believe! obey not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, to the exclusion of true believers; will you give God manifest occasion to chastise you for your sins? The wicked shall be in the lowest place of Hell, and shall find no relief, except such as shall repent, that shall do good works, resign themselves to God, and obey his Commandments, they shall be with the true believers, and receive from God a very great reward. He will not send you misery, if you give him thanks for his favours, and obey him; he accepteth the acknowledgment of his benefits, and knoweth all things. He willeth not that what evil is committed, be publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he that publisheth the evil he doth, is very much to blame; if you manifest the good you do, or if you conceal it, and abstain from doing evil, he will be merciful to you, he is Omnipotent. Such as blaspheme against God and his Prophets, his Apostles; such as would make a distinction between the Commandments of his Divine Majesty, and the precepts of his Prophets; such as affirm' they believe in some of the Prophets, and believe not in all, and take a middle way between faith and impiety, are indeed impious, we have prepared for them

ignominious torments; but they who believe in God, and generally in all his Prophets, and Apostles, shall be recompensed of God, graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and merciful.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:36900:77"/>
Such as have the knowledge of Scripture, ought to believe in Jesus before his death; he shall be a witness against them of their actions at the Day of Judgment; We have prohibited them that Judaize, by reason of their sin, things that were permitted them; We have prepared for them great torment, because they mis-lead the World from the right way, because they take Use that is forbidden them, and unjustly eat the substance of their neighbour. Such of them as are profound in Learning, and all the faithful, believe in the Scriptures, both ancient, and modern; I will give great rewards to them that shall make their prayers at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, that shall pay Tyths, and believe in the Day of Judgment. We have sent thee our inspirations, as we sent them to <hi>Noah,</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets after him; as we heretofore sent them to <hi>Abraham, Ismael, Isaac, Iacob,</hi> the Tribes, to Jesus, <hi>Iob, Ionas, Aaron,</hi> and to <hi>Solomon,</hi> and gave the Psalter to <hi>David.</hi> We have told thee who were the Prophets that preceded thee; but we have not spoken to thee, concerning the merits of all of them. <hi>Moses</hi> spake to God, as his Prophet, and Apostle; all declared his mercy, and preached the torments of Hell, to the end Men might have no cause of excuse; God is Omnipotent and prudent in all his actions: He shall be witness that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> was sent to thee with his Commandments, the Angels likewise shall testifie it; but it ought to suffice thee, that God is witness. The Infidels that hinder the People to follow the Law of God, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly erroneous; God will not pardon them, he will lead them into the path of Hell, where they shall remain eternally, it is a thing easie to his Divine Majesty.

O ye that understand the written Law! Obey the Commandments of God, and speak not of his Divine Majesty but with truth; the Messiah, Jesus, the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and an Apostle of God, his Word, and his Spirit, which he sent to <hi>Mary;</hi> believe therefore in God, and in his Prophets, and say not there be three Gods, put an end to that discourse, you shall do well; For there is but one God, praised be God, he hath no Son; whatever is in Heaven, and in Earth obeyeth him, it is sufficient that he is witness. The Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah esteemeth in no dishonour to be the servant of God, neither the Angel, nor the Cherubins; He that holdeth it a dishonour to be at his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, is too proud; he shall assemble all the World at the Day of Judgment, and every one shall receive the recompence that he shall have merited, he shall augment his favours upon them that shall have believed in his Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, and have done good works; he shall cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise them that shall have held it a dishonour to be his servants, and have been proud upon the Earth, they shall find no safe refuge but in his mercy.

O ye that believe in God, when you would make your Prayers, wash your Faces, your Hands to the Elbow, and pass your hand over your head, and over your feet to the ancles. If you be polluted, purifie your selves; if sick, or in a Journey, or about to discharge your Belly, or have known Women, and find no water to wash you, lay hand on the Sand, pass it over your Visage, and wipe therewith your hands. God enjoyneth you nothing irksome, but will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you be clean, and desireth to accomplish his Grace upon you; peradventure you will give him thanks. O ye that believe in God! call to mind his Grace, and promise he made to you, when you said, We heard, and obeyed, fear him, he knoweth all that is in your hearts. O ye that believe in God! obey his Commandments, and be true in your Testimonies, take heed that no man move you to offend God, in diverting you from what is just; render justice to all, his fear inviteth you to it; have it before your eyes, he knoweth all your Actions; hath promised his grace, and great recompences to the true Believers, that shall do good works in this World, and hath prepared Hell to punish Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels.

When they swerved from what they had promised, we gave them our Curse, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their heart; they have altered the words of the Scripture, and abjured what they had approved. Thou shalt not know them that shall be Traytors, except very few of them; forgive and depart from them, God loveth them that do good. We likewise received the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of those who call themselves <hi>Christians,</hi> but they have forgotten what they promised; they have altered what was taught them, and we have cast among them Enmity and hatred, even until the Day of Judgment. That day God shall cause them to know whatever they have done for their punishment. O ye that know the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Law! our <note n="*" place="margin">Mahomet.</note> Prophet is come to bring to light many things of the Scripture, which you conceal, and he likewise leaveth in silence many things, that it is not time to make manifest. God hath sent you a Book full of light, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct into the way of Salvation them that love him, to bring them out of darkness, and by his special Grace, to lead them into the way of Salvation. Certainly he that saith, that the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> is God, is impious: Say to him, who can hinder God to exterminate the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and his Mother, with whatsoever is in the Earth, when it shall seem good to him? God is King of Heaven and Earth, he created with them what seemed good to him, he is Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent. The <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> have said, we
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:36900:80"/>
are the Children of God, his well beloved; Say to them, shall not God chastise you for your sins? Certainly ye are men; He that created you, pardoneth, and punisheth as it pleaseth him, he is the King of all that is in Heaven or Earth, and of whatever is between them, he is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of the righteous. O ye that have knowledge in the written Law! The Prophet, the Apostle of God is come to instruct you in a time that there is none other Prophet but he on the Earth; Will you say that no man preached to you the torments of Hell? Certainly the word of God is this day preached to you, the torment of Hell, and the Omnipotency of his Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty. Remember thou what <hi>Moses</hi> said to his people, O people, call to mind the grace of God towards you, he hath chosen from among you Prophets, and Kings, hath conferred on you what he hath given to none in the World: Enter into the Holy Land, as God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, turn not your Backs to your Enemies, lest you be in the number of Reprobates: They answered, O <hi>Moses!</hi> there are Gyants and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants in the Holy Land, we will not enter into it, until they be gone out of it, if they forsake it, we will enter into it. Then two men of them that were in the grace of God, said to them, enter at the Gate, and fight against them, you shall be Victorious, trust in God, if you believe in his Law: They said, O <hi>Moses!</hi> we will not enter, so long as those Tyrants dwell therein, go and fight against them with thy Lord, we will here attend. Then, said <hi>Moses,</hi> Lord, I dispose but of mine own, and my Brothers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; separate us from this wicked people; the Lord said to him, the entrance into the Holy Land is prohibited to this people, they shall
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:36900:81"/>
wander forty years upon the Earth, in confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and amazement, afflict not thy self with the Deportments of the wicked; teach them the History of the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> how they offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sacrifices, how the Sacrifice of the one was accepted, that of the other was not: he through envy menaced his Brother, to murther him; his Brother said to him, God receiveth the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and Holocausts of such as have his fear before their eyes: assuredly if thou extendest thine hand to slay me, I will not stretch forth mine to hurt thee; I fear the Lord of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse; If thou chargest thy self with the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of my Person, with thy past sins, thou shalt go to Hell, where the unjust shall be punished: The murther of his Brother seemed easie and advantagious for him, he slew him, and is in the number of the Damned. God sent a Raven that made a Pit in the Earth, and shewed him the manner to bury the Body of his Brother: Then said he, would to God I had been weak and impotent, that I were like to this Raven? I must bury the Body of my Brother, and he was penitent for his offence; by reason of this murther, we ordained to the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> that he who shall slay a Person innocent, shall be punished, as if he had slain the whole World, and he that shall give him his Life, shall be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed, as if he had given Life to the whole World. My Prophets came to the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> taught them my Commandments, and caused them to see Miracles, nevertheless ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them were disobedient: the punishment of them that oppose the Will of God, that of his Prophet, and that endeavour to pollute the Earth, is to be slain, hanged, to have the right foot, and the left hand, or right hand, and the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:36900:81"/>
left foot cut off, and to be extirpated from the Earth; they shall have in this World shame on the Forehead, and shall feel in the other, great torments, except such as shall be converted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their death, and shall know, that God is gracious and merciful. O ye that believe! fear God, fight for his Law, you perhaps shall be happy. All the Treasures of the World shall not be able to redeem Infidels at the Day of Judgment, they shall endure exceeding great torments, they shall desire to go out of the fire of Hell, but shall dwell there eternally. Cut off the hands of those Men and Women that steal, they contract upon themselves the wrath of the World, and the punishment that God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the wicked: He that shall turn, and do good works, shall be pardoned, God is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and merciful to the penitent. Knowest thou not that the Kingdom of Heaven, and of Earth is Gods? that he chastiseth and pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whom it pleaseth him? and that he is Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent? O Prophet! afflict not thy self, to behold them running to impiety; that say with the mouth, we believe, and have no Faith in their hearts; neither for them that <hi>Iudaize,</hi> and hearken to the lies of their Doctors, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them to others; they pervert the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Old Testament, and say; If you be instructed in those Precepts, you ought to observe them, if they instruct you not in them, take heed to your selves. Such as make use of the name of God, to move the people to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, are without Faith, God will not puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their hearts, they shall have in this World shame upon the Forehead, and feel in the other extream torments. They listen to blasphemies, and eat what is prohibited; If they repair to

thee, and submit themselves to thy Judgment, judge their Controversie with Equity, converse not with them; if thou depart from their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, they shall not hurt thee, if thou givest judgment between them, judge with Equity, God loveth the Just: How shall they submit to thy judgment, seeing they have the Old Testament, which containeth the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God? They will not execute thy Judgment, neither believe in the Old Testament, wherein is the guide of the right way, and a light to the Prophets, to judge the differences arising among true Believers, among <hi>Iews;</hi> their Doctors, and their Priests, who study the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and are Witnesses that it containeth the truth, fear not the World, but dread me; sell not, neither exchange my Commandments for any price. Such as judge not conformably to the Law of God, are Infidels; We have ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Talio,</hi> man for man, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, a wound for a wound; he that shall observe it, shall do well, and such as shall not judge conformably to the Law of God, are unjust. We sent after many Prophets, Jesus the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> who confirmed the ancient Scriptures, to him we gave the Gospel, full of light, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the people to the right way, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Old Testament, a guide and instruction for the righteous. They that follow the Gospel, ought to judge as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Gospel; such as judge not conformably to what God hath taught them, are disobedient to his Divine Majesty. To thee have we sent the Book that contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the truth, and confirmeth the ancient Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, determine the differences that shall arise
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:36900:82"/>
among the people, as I have inspired thee, and follow not the Appetite of men that will abjure the truth which I have taught thee. We have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed all of you in a Law, and assured means to lead you into the way of Salvation; you should all have been of one and the same Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, had it so pleased God; he hath done this to prove you; Do good, and know, that you all shall be assembled before him, and he shall resolve the doubts that are among you. If thou judgest the differences that are among them, judge conformably to what hath been inspired into thee, and follow not their Appetites; be careful they seduce thee not, and move thee to doubt many things that God hath taught thee; if they disobey his Commandments, know, he will severely punish them, because of the Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of their Crimes. The greatest part of the World are impious; Do they affect the Judgment of the Ignorant? What better Judge for the good, is there than God? O ye that believe! obey not the <hi>Iews,</hi> nor the <hi>Christians,</hi> they mutually obey each other in their impiety, he that shall obey them, shall be like unto them, God guideth not the unjust. Thou seest such as are unstable in their Faith, flock to them, and say, they fear a change of times, but God shall give advantage and Victory to his Prophet, and they shall repent to have concealed in their minds the Miracles of his Divine Majesty. What will they alledge for excuse, who swore by the name of God, exactly to observe their Religion, and to be with you? Their good works shall be unprofitable, and they in the number of the Damned. O ye that believe! if you abandon your Faith, God will put others in your place, that shall love him, and he them, and this to

You ought certainly to obey God, and his Prophet, his Apostle; they who believe in God, that make their Prayers at the time appointed, pay Tithes, and are in the Protection of God and his Prophet, shall be beloved of his Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, and be Victorious. O ye true Believers! obey not such as scoff at your Religion, who have knowledge of the written Law; obey not Infidels, and if you are good men, fear God; obey not them that deride your Prayers, it is the action of those that are unwise. O ye that understand the written Law! will you not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor me, if I believe not in God, in what he hath inspired into me, and into them that preceded me? The greatest part of you are wicked. Say to them, did I instruct you to do evil, when I preached to you the effect of Gods mercy? Those whom he curseth, against whom he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed, whom he hath Metamorphosed into Apes, and Swine, and who have adored Idols, shall be confined in the fire of Hell, they are in a very evil way. When they come to thee, they will say, they believe in the Law of God, they will enter thine House with impiety, and go forth in the like manner, but God knoweth what they conceal in their heart: Thou shalt see many of them embrace Paganism, follow a lye, eat what is forbidden, and this to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please their Doctors, and Priests, who have forbidden them to speak lies, and eat meats that are unclean. The <hi>Iews</hi> said, The hand of God is shut, contrariwise, it is their hand that is shut, and they shall be accursed by reason
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:36900:83"/>
of their discourse: certainly the hands of God are open, and he doth good to whom he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth: Many amongst them, through impiety, and disobedience, alter what is in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; but we have cast among them hatred, and horror, even to the Day of Judgment, God hath extinguished the fire which they had kindled, to make War against the righteous; they endeavour to pollute the Earth, but God detesteth such as cause disorder; he remitteth their sins that know the Scripture, believe in his Law, and flie impiety, they shall enter Paradise, that is full of delights. They have read the Old Testament, the Gospel, and all Scriptures, they enjoy abundance of all good things; nevertheless many have disobeyed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God. O Prophet! preach what God hath taught thee; whether thou dost preach it, or doest not, he will defend thee from the malice of men, he abhorreth Infidels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O ye that know the written Law! if you observe not the Old Testament, the Gospel, and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures which God hath sent you, you shall be without merit.

The <hi>Messiah,</hi> the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and Apostle of God, like to the Prophets that came before him; his Mother is holy, and both of them did eat and drink.

O ye Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers! be careful of your selves, such as be in errour shall not hurt you; if you follow the right way, all of you shall one day be assembled before God, who shall discover all your works, and reward you according to your merits. O ye Believers! make your Testament, when your death approacheth, and take two Witnesses of your own Religion, that are honest men; If you are in a journey, and sickness surprize you, you shall take two witnesses, such as you shall meet with to serve your Testament, and having pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, shall deliver to them your Will. If you doubt their integrity, cause them to swear to be faithful in their testimonies, and not give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be corrupted by your Kindred.

If you discover those two witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to have erred in their testimony, substitute two other in their place, although they partake in your succession, and take Oath of them to be more veritable in their dispositions, than the two others, otherwise they will offend God, and be numbred with the unjust. It is better to speak Truth, than to be in fear, lest your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood be detected; fear God, and hearken to his Commandments, he guideth not them that disobey him. He shall one day assemble his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles, and say unto them what did you answer, being questioned concerning my unity? they shall reply, Lord, we are ignorant, thou alone knowest all things.

Say to them, I have received a command to embrace the Law of Salvation. Be not ye in number of unbelievers; I fear to disobey my Lord, and fear the torments prepared for the wicked at the day of Judgment; he that shall deliver himself, shall enjoy the grace of God, which is supream felicity: If God will punish you, none shall deliver you from his punishment; if his Will is to do good to you, he is Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, always victorious, and hath all power over his Creatures; he is most wise and Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scient. Say to them, What better testimony is there in the World than that of God? Say to them, He shall testifie between you and me, to whom he hath inspired the <hi>Alcoran</hi> to instruct you: Will any among you that shall learn it, say there is any other God, but God; I will not say so; there is but one God, and I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent from the sin you commit, in associating him with a companion equal to him; many of them that understand the written Law, have knowledge of the truth of the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> their Children also know it, but such as forsake their own Souls, will not believe in God. Who more unjust, than he that blasphemeth against God and his Commandments? Certainly the wicked shall be miserable; I will assemble all of them, and say, Where are the gods which you did associate with God? They shall have none other excuse, but to say, by God, Lord, we were of the number of Idolaters.

Certainly he heareth the prayers of the righteous, that hearken to his word; he will give resurrection to the dead, and assemble them to receive recompense ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their merits. They have said, we believe not in the Prophet, if he shew not to us some miracle from his Lord: say unto them, God hath shewed you many miracles, but most of you do not understand them; the beasts that walk upon the Earth and the birds that flie in the Air, are in the number of his creatures: We have not omitted to write any thing that is written in the Book kept in Heaven; all Men shall one day appear before God, such as shall not have believed in his Law, shall be deaf and dumb, and inhabit darkness: God misleadeth whom it pleaseth him, and guideth in the right way whom he seeth good. Say unto them, have you felt the punishment of God? Have you had knowledge of the day of Judgment? Will you invoke any but God, if you be good Men? If you implore him, he will deliver you from the evils that you fear; and if it please him you shall abandon the Idols, which with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers you adore.

Hath God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned any but the wicked? He sent not the Prophets and Apostles, but to proclaim the felicity of Paradise, and preach the torments of Hell: He that shall believe, and do good works, shall be exempt from fear at the Day of Judgment, and unbelievers shall be punished, because of their disobedience. Say unto them, I told you not that I had in my power all the treasures of God, neither that I had knowledge of the future, and past; nor do affirm, that I am an Angel, I only act what hath been inspired into me; is the blind like to him that seeth clearly? Consider what I say. I preach not the Day of Judgment but to such as apprehend it, they shall find none other than God to protect them; peradventure they will fear his Divine Majesty.

Thus do I recount the graces of God, and discover the way of sinners; Say unto them, I am forbidden to worship what you adore, lest I should go astray from the right way. I have received from God a light, which ye have contemned; God is Judge of all things, judgeth with truth, and is most just in his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I cannot forthwith give you a sight of the torments of Hell, neither of the chastisement of God, which you with so much instance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; this dependeth on his Divine Majesty; had I this power, our difference would be soon at a period. God knoweth the unjust, in his power are the Keys of the future, none know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but he; he knoweth whatsoever is in the Earth, and the Sea, the number of the leaves that fall from the Trees, and of the Atomes that are in the darkness of the Earth. There is nothing dry or green in the Earth, that is not written in the Book of Light. He it is that causeth you to die in the night, and knoweth the good and evil that you have committed by day; he shall cause you to rise again at the day nominated; you all shall appear before him, he shall give you knowledge of your sins, and shall chastise you after your demerits; he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways victorious and Omnipotent. He shall send to observe your actions; and when you shall arrive at the hour of death, he shall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch his Messengers, who shall not fail to execute his commands; the People shall repair to him, as to their Lord, he is extreamly exact to keep account. Say unto them, He shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver

you from the darkness of the Sea, and of the Earth; when you shall in secret or publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invoke him; if he deliver me, I will return him thanks for his grace: Say unto them, God can deliver you from darkness, and all other afflictions; yet say you, He hath a Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, associate with him; Say unto them, We can send punishments from above, and from below; he is able to disunite, and cause you to taste a thousand miseries, which you shall bring upon each other. Consider how I shew them the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of my Omnipotency; they will perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture comprehend my sayings: Those of thy Nations have rejected them, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they are most true: say unto them, I am not your Tutor; every thing hath its time, you shall hereafter understand the truth. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from them that speak of our Law with contempt, until he speak otherwise; the Devil would induce thee to forget my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and cause thee to sit down with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just: the true believers shall not regard their discourse, neither cease to admonish them, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure they will be converted. Depart thou from such as sport and mock at their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the wealth of this World rendreth them haughty; declare, they shall be severely punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; none is able to protect or hear them but God, no ransom is able to deliver them; they shall find the good and evil that they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, shall drink a liquor extreamly cold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and endure grievous torments, because of their impiety; say unto them, shall we worship in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of God, what can neither benefit nor hurt us? Sall we return on our steps to our sins, having been guided by his Divine Majesty, like unto him whom the Devil hath seduced? He

I will wholly resign my self to the pleasure of his Divine Majesty: Make your prayers at the time appointed, and pay Tythes, you all shall appear before God at the Day of Judgment, to give account of your actions. He it is that created Heaven and Earth. Remember thou the Day wherein he said, Be thou, and every thing was: he shall reign, and at that day command an Angel to sound the Trumpet, to call to universal Judgment, the living and the dead. He knoweth the future, present, and past; is most Wise, and nothing is hidden from him.

                  <hi>Azer,</hi> wherefore do you worship Idols instead of God? I perceive your Family to be in manifest errour: God shewed to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> the Kingdom of Heaven, and of Earth, and he was in the number of the Blessed. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> seeing by night a most clear Star, asked in himself, if it were his God; no, replyed he to himself, my God doth not rise and set; seeing the Moon to arise, he demanded if that were his God; no, said he to himself, certainly God will not guide me to be of them that are erroneous: when he beheld the Sun rising, he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise asked, if that were his God; and when he saw it set, he said to his people, I am inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the sin which you commit, in adoring many Gods, I wholly commend my self to his Will, who created Heaven and Earth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess his Unity: His people would dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; he said to them, will you dispute against me concerning the Unity of God, who
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:36900:91"/>
hath instructed me in the right way? I fear not your Idols, my God doth what pleaseth him, and knoweth all things, will you not consider it? How shall I fear your Idols, since you are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to affirm, that God hath Companions equal to him, which you have no reason to adore? If you understand the truth, who is more true, you, or I? Such as believe in God, and shall not cover the truth with a lie, shall be delivered from the torments of Hell, and conducted into the way of Salvation. We instructed <hi>Abraham</hi> with reasons to dispute against his people; I give knowledge to whom I see good, and exalt whom I please. Thy Lord, O <hi>Abraham,</hi> seeth and knoweth all things; we gave to <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> his Sons; we before instructed <hi>Noah</hi> and his Lineage in the right way; we taught it <hi>David, Solomon, Iob, Ioseph, Moses, Aaron, Zachary,</hi> St. <hi>Iohn, Iesus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Mary, Eliah, Ismael, Ioshua, Ionas,</hi> and <hi>Lot;</hi> we gratified them above the residue of the World; we elected their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Brothers, and Progeny, and guided them in the right way: Thus God guideth whom he seeth good: Men before adored Idols, and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth there were many Gods; nevertheless he blotted out their past Errours, when they were converted. If they slander them that have knowledge of the Scriptures, and of Prophecies, will give power over their Persons to Men that shall mis-lead them with the Infidels: Those whom God guideth, believe in the Unity of his Divine Majesty. Say unto them, I require no reward for having preached to you the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> he teacheth to all the World the Commandments of God. The <hi>Iews</hi> have not honoured him as was their Duty; they understood not his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when they said, he hath instructed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:36900:92"/>
in nothing that is profitable. Say unto them, who gave the Tables unto <hi>Moses?</hi> who instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him in the Scripture, which they have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Vellum, to guide and illuminate the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? They have published what pleased them, and have concealed much; they shall learn in the <hi>Alcoran</hi> what they know not, and what their Fathers understood not: Say to them, God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that left them obstinate, and amazed in their Errours. We have sent from Heaven that Book full of Blessedness, it confirmeth the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures that were sent before it, to the end thou mayst instruct the people of <hi>Mecca,</hi> them that inhabit about that City, and the rest of the World. Such as shall believe in the Day of Judgment, believe in what is written in this Book, and shall pray to God to deliver them from the torments of Hell: Who is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, than he that blasphemeth against God? that saith, God hath inspired into him what he uttereth, notwithstanding he hath received no inspiration from his Divine Majesty. Who more unjust, than he that saith, he will cause to descend from Heaven, things like to those which God inspired into his Prophets? When thou shalt see the wicked at the point of death, and the Angels stretching forth their hands to take their Souls: say unto them, This day the torments of Hell shall be the punishment of the blasphemies that ye have vomited against God, and your disobedience to his Commandments. God shall say to them, you are come before us without Riches, and Children, naked as you were created, and have cast behind your Backs the instructions which we gave you; I see not with you the Idols you adored; you are separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from each other, and have forsaken them,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:36900:92"/>
that you esteemed on Earth, should have been your Protectors; God separateth the good from the wicked, as the Corn from the Ear, and the stone from the Date: He causeth the Living to spring from the dead, and the dead from the living: behold the works of God; why will you depart from his Law? He divideth the Morning from darkness, hath established Night for the repose of Men, and the Sun and Moon to compute Ages, Years, Months, and Seasons; such are the effects of Gods power, he is Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, and knoweth all things. He it is that created the Stars to give you light, and guide you in the obscurity of the Earth and Sea; he gratifieth with his Grace, such as learn his Commandments. He it is that created you of one sole Person, that gave you the Earth to inhabit, and preserveth you in the World, he hath conferred his Grace on such as have obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Commandments, hath made Rain to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend from Heaven, and caused the Earth to produce divers sorts of Herbs, Green things, and Corn; he hath caused the Date to spring forth, and the Palm Tree, with Gardens en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with Grapes, Olives, Pomgranets, and many Fruits alike, and different. Consider how Fruits encrease and multiply; this serveth for instruction of Gods Unity, to them that have his fear before their eyes: the Infidels have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored the Devil, with God, who created them, and said, that God hath Sons and Daughters, such is their ignorance; praised be God, he created Heaven and Earth; how shall he have a Son, who hath no Wives? He createth and knoweth all things, he is your God, and your Lord, there is none other God but he; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him, he conserveth all things, he is seen

of no Man, and beholdeth all things, he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign, and nothing is concealed from him. O people, there is come to you a light from your Lord to conduct you, he that seeth clearly shall receive advantage; and he that shall be blind, shall continue his Misery: I am your Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, neither observe I what you do; Thus do I declare the Mysteries of my Law, the wicked shall in the end confess that thou hast taught my Commandments to such as inclined to learn them. Act what thy Lord hath inspired into thee, there is no God but he, separate thy self from the Society of unbelievers; Had it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God, they had not disobeyed his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, thou art not their Tutor, injure not them that worship Idols, they injure God through Malice and Ignorance, every Man e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemeth what he hath done, and pleaseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in his opinion. Certainly they shall all be assembled at the Judgment, and be chastised after their Demerits. They have sworn by the name of God to fight for the Faith, if some Miracle appear to instruct them; Miracles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from God, they know not the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he will make them to appear; although they should see Miracles, they will not be converted. I will overturn their hearts, blind their sight, and they shall never be converted, I will leave them in their Errours, and disobedience, with contempt and confusion. If we should send to them Angels, should the dead come and speak to them, and should we bring about them all the Witnesses of the World, they shall not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, if it so please God, most of them are ignorant; we have allotted an Enemy to each Prophet; as the Devil is an Enemy to Men, he tempteth them with the Ornament of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:36900:93"/>
to render them proud. If it had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thy Lord, they had wanted that power; depart thou from unbelievers, and their blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, and incline not to their will; they shall find no advantage in their impiety. Do you desire another Judge than God, who hath sent to you the Book that distinguisheth good from evil? Such as know the Scripture are not ignorant that this Book was sent from God, and containeth the Truth; Be not thou in the number of them that doubt, the word of God exactly cometh to pass, no Man can hinder its effects, God understandeth and knoweth all things. If thou incline to the will of most Men, they will seduce thee, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve but their own opinions, and are lyars. Thy Lord knoweth them that err, and such as follow the right way. Eat what shall be slain in pronouncing the name of God; they taught you what was forbidden; eat not, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less constrained through necessity: Many err from the right way, and pursue their own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, and ignorance, God beholdeth them that offend him; flie publick and secret sin, sinners shall be severely chastised; eat not of what is not let Blood in pronouncing the name of God, lest you disobey his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Devils will tempt them that serve them, they will perswade unbelievers to dispute against you; if you incline to them, you shall be Infidels as they are. I raised again many of them that were dead through their sins, I converted them, and gave them a light to illuminate them, in the darkness, wherein Infidels shall dwell for ever, because they delight in their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience: Thus will I place in every City, leaders, that shall seduce the wicked, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:36900:94"/>
themselves, but shall not understand it: When they beheld any sign (of the truth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) appear; they said, they will not believe in him, unless he were accompanied with the vertues, and merits of other Prophets; God maketh choice of them on whom he conferreth the grace of prophecy, he shall chastise such as discourse in that manner, with ignominie in this World, and they shall feel in the other great torments, by reason of their impiety. God rejoyceth the hearts of them that he incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to lead into the way of Salvation, and punisheth them that digress from the right path; his wrath fell upon the Infidels so soon as he ascended into Heaven. The way thou followest is the right way; we have recompensed such as have understanding to profit, they shall be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, God shall be their protector, because of their good works. Remember thou the day wherein we shall assemble the People, and when it shall be said to the Devils, O ye bands of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils! wherefore are you risen against Men? The chief of those Men that shall have obeyed them, shall answer, Lord, suffer us to be revenged on each other, and let each command in his turn; O Lord, teach us the prefixed time that thou<note place="margin">See <hi>Gelal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din.</hi>
                  </note> hast appointed to our miseries: The Angels shall answer, Hell shall be your habitation, you shall there remain eternally, and so long as it shall please God: Your Lord is most wise, and Omniscient; the wicked shall obey the wicked, because of their sins. O ye Bands of Men and Devils! have you not seen my Prophets, and Apostles of your own Nation, who have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you to see Miracles? Who have preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Commandments, and the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? They shall answer, they have seen the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:36900:94"/>
Prophets, and Apostles, but that the life of the World rendered them proud, and shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess themselves to have been wicked. God shall not destroy <hi>Mecca</hi> for the unjustice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in committed, until he hath sent an Apostle to the Inhabitants, to teach them his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; every one shall be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to his works, thy Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whatsoever is done in the World. He hath no need of his People, he is altogether merciful, he can destroy you if it please him, and establish in your place another People, as he hath established you in the place of your predecessors. If you be not converted, you shall not escape the torments of Hell; Say unto them, do as you understand him, I will comport my self, as I shall apprehend him; you shall in the end understand who shall have the good part in the other World. None shall give succour to Idolaters, they offer to their Idols of the fruits that God hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and say, (following their thoughts) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold our God! Such sacrifices ascend not to God, their Idolatry hath induced many of them to sacrifice their own Children to their false Gods, they have destroyed them, and were ensnared in their Religion; which they had not done, had it so pleased God; Separate thy self from them and their blasphemies, they have said, that the fruits of the Earth, and the benefits of God were unclean, and would not eat of them. God giveth food but to those whom he is pleased to gratifie. They have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to ride on some beasts that God gave them, and slew them for food, without pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the name of his Divine Majesty, which is a great sin, but they shall be punished according
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:36900:95"/>
to their demerits. They have said it is lawful for Men to eat what is in the Bellies of Beasts, and that it is unlawful for their Wives, and when they had slain them, they did eat for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; but God shall chastise them for their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, he is most wise, and Omniscient. Such as slay their Children are wretched Men, Fools and ignorant, they have forbidden to eat the good things that God hath given them, to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, and are gone astray from the right way. It is God who created the Gardens full of Fruits and herbs of divers colours with Olives, Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granets, and other fruits alike, and different: Eat of the fruits of the Earth: Pay the dues ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed when you reap, and dispense not your substance lightly; God abhorreth prodigals: Of clean beasts, some there be that have born the burthen, and others that are young, and have not born it; Eat what God hath given you, and follow not the footsteps of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, he is your open Enemy. Say unto them,<note place="margin">See <hi>Kitab el tenoir.</hi>
                  </note> behold eight pair of Beasts, <hi>viz.</hi> two pair of Wethers, two of Ewes, two of Camels, and two pair of Cowes, of which is it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, or forbidden you to eat? Is it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for you to eat the Males, or Females? Which are those that God hath forbidden you? Who is more wicked than he that blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemeth, to seduce from the right way the People that are ignorant? God guideth not the unjust; Say unto them, In all that God hath inspired into me, I find not that it is prohibited to eat of those beasts, except they die of some Disease, and if they be slain without pronouncing the name of God. The Flesh of Swine is forbidden you; if you eat of it, you incur the wrath of God; If any one
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:36900:95"/>
be in necessity, and eateth without design to provoke God, he shall find God gracious and merciful. We forbad the <hi>Iews</hi> to eat of Beasts whose Feet were cloven, and of the fat of Beasts, except of such as is interlarded in the flesh; the Entrails and the Bones. We enjoyned this prohibition by reason of their sin, and we are veritable in our words, and exact in our promises: If they slander thee, say unto them, The mercy of God is great, and the wicked shall not avoid the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their crimes. The Infidels have said, Had it pleased God, we had not been unbelievers, neither our Fathers also, and nothing had been prohibited. Their predecessors spake as they, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they felt the punishment of their sin. Say unto them, Are you assured that God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with your proceeding? Tell us, whence ariseth this assurance? You, in this, follow but your opinion, you are but lyers, Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is great; he had guided all of you in the right way, had it so pleased him. Cause them come before us, who said, It is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to eat of clean Beasts; were they present when God made the Prohibition? If they say they were present, say not as they, neither follow the appetites of blasphemous Infidels, who believe not in the end of the word, and worship many Gods. Say unto them, Come, I will instruct you what is by God forbidden to be eaten; there is but one sole God, say not, he hath Companions equal to him; do good to your Father and Mother, and slay not your Children, in fear of dying with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, God shall bestow on you and them also, what shall be necessary; commit not whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, either privately or publickly; kill no

Man, if justice do not command it: God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth you to observe what is above (or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained) perhaps you will consider it. Take not the goods of Orphans, but to succour them, until they be of age, of discretion, measure, and weight, with good weight, and just measure. I enjoyn no Man any thing, but what is in his power to perform. Judge with equity, although it be against your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Allies; satisfie what is above (or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained) God commandeth it, peradventure you will consider it; it is the right way, which you ought to pursue: go not aside, God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth it, perhaps you will fear his Divine Majesty. We taught <hi>Moses</hi> our Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; it is a peculiar grace to instruct the righteous, and guide the People in the right way; it may be you will believe in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. O ye Inhabitants of <hi>Mecca!</hi> We have sent to you the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> full of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, perform what is ordained, flie impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, your sins shall be forgiven you; say not, That God hath sent his Law to the two<note place="margin">The <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi>

Certainly he hath taught you his Commandments, it is a special grace to guide you into the right way: Who is more unjust, than he that blasphemeth against his Divine Majesty, and departeth from his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments? Such Men shall be rigorously chastised in the fire of Hell. Will they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the Angels came to visit them? That God should punish, and declare to them his miracles? Will they look for the Day of Judgment, wherein repentance and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

shall be unprofitable? Such as believe in one part of the Law, and reject the other, have no foundation in their belief.

               <p>IN the name of God, gracious and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: I am God, the most wise, the most true. This Book was sent to thee, to preach to the True believers; doubt not the Contents of it. Say unto them, Believe in what was sent to you from your Lord, and worship none other God but him; few there be among you that consider it. How many Cities have we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed? How often have we inflicted our pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment on their Inhabitants by day, and by night, when they reposed? Nevertheless, they said nothing, but that they were greatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. We will examine the People to whom we have sent our Prophets, and require ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what they have learned, and of what they have done. We will examine our Prophets, and demand an account of such as have followed, and obeyed them. I will cause them to remember what they have done worthy of reward. We forsook not our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets when they preached to them the Truth;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:36900:97"/>
their actions shall be weighed in the Ballance of Equity; the Ballance of the blessed shall be pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous with good works; and they whose Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance shall be light of good works, shall be damned, for having contemned our Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. We gave you your habitation on the Earth, and there bestowed on you what was necessary for your nourishment; but few of you are grateful to me. We created and formed you, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Angels to worship <hi>Adam,</hi> which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, except the Devil, to whom we said, what hindred thee to worship <hi>Adam,</hi> when we commanded thee? He answered, I am better than he, thou hast created me of fire, and hast crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Man of the mire of the Earth; then said we to him; depart out of Paradise, it is not the habitation of the Proud, thou shalt be in the number of them that shall be laden with Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny; the Devil answered; let me alone until the day of the Resurrection of the dead; wherefore hast thou tempted me? I will se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Men from the right way, I will hinder them on the right hand, and on the left, and on all sides, to believe in thy Law, and the greatest part of them shall be ungrateful: we said to him, be gone out of Paradise, thou shalt be abhorred of all the World, and deprived of my mercy; I will fill Hell with such as shall follow thee. O <hi>Adam!</hi> dwell with thy Wife in Paradise, and there eat of whatsoever shall please thee, but approach not that Tree, lest thou with thy Wife be in the number of the unjust. The Devil tempted them, and despoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their Bodies of their Vestments of grace; he said to them, God bath forbidden you to eat of the Fruit of that Tree, that you may not be Angels, or eternal; he swore that he spake
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:36900:98"/>
the truth, and filled them with Ignominy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their Pride. They knew their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness, having eaten of that Fruit, and to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themselves, took leaves of Paradise; their Lord called them, and said, Did I not forbid you to approach that Tree? I told both of you, that the Devil was your open Enemy; they said, Lord, we have offended thee, and injured our Souls, if thou dost not compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate us, we shall be in the number of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: he said, Depart out of Paradise, ye Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of each other, you shall inhabit the Earth, until the time appointed; you shall there live and die, and go from the Earth to the Day of Judgment. O ye Children of <hi>Adam!</hi> we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on you Vestments of Graces, signs of our Omnipotency, peradventure you will bear it in mind. O ye Children of <hi>Adam!</hi> beware lest the Devil seduce you, as he did your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother, when he caused their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of Paradise; he dispoyled them of their Garments, and made them know their deformity; he shall appear to you, with such as follow them, and you shall see him, when you least think thereon; he protecteth the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels: when they commit any Fault, they say, we follow the Law of our Fathers, God hath so commanded us. Say unto them, Doth God command you to offend him? Will you speak of God what you know not? he hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you to do Justice, to worship him, and embrace his Law. Many shall rise again, as you have seen them; some shall be in the right way, others shall be damned, because they have obeyed the Devil, and believed they were in the right way. O Children of <hi>Adam,</hi> cloath your selves decently, when you shall repair to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:36900:98"/>
the Temples, eat and drink what pleaseth you; be not Prodigal, God abhorreth them that spend their wealth unprofitably: Say unto them, who made the prohibition of decent cloathing, when men go to the Temple to worship God? Who hath forbidden to eat of the Goods that God hath given you? This is lawful for true Believers. God shall so expound his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at the Day of Judgment. Say unto them, God hath forbidden you Whoredom, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and publick, disobedience, injustice, desire to adore any other God but him, and to speak of his Divine Majesty what you know not; every one hath his Predestination, and none can advance or retard it. O ye Children of <hi>Adam,</hi> did not the Prophets teach you my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Such as shall fear me, and do good works, shall be delivered from affliction at the Day of Judgment; and they that disobey my Commandments, that arise against the Faith, shall dwell eternally in Hell fire. Who is more unjust, than he that blasphemeth against God and his Commandments? Such shall be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed conformably to the Scripture. When the Angels of Death shall cause them to die, they shall say, where be the Idols that you adored instead of God? they shall answer, that those false Gods have forsaken them, and shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their Idolatry; but God shall say to them, enter into Hell with the Men and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils that are condemned; they shall execrate the Sects that preceeded them, and being assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, they shall say, Lord, judge them, they se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced us, augment their Miseries in Hell. God shall say, we will add to their, and your pains, but you understand it not. They shall say among themselves, we are not the cause that you were
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:36900:99"/>
unbelievers, you were not such to please us, suffer with us the torments that you have me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited. I will not open the gate of Heaven to such as disobey my Commandments, until a Camel pass through the eye of a Needle, so will I chastise sinners, Hell shall be their Bed, Fire shall be their covering; and such as shall have done good works, according to their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, shall dwell eternally in Paradise. I will remove Deceit far from their heart; Rivers shall flow in their Fields with delights; and they shall say, praised be God, who hath brought us hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, otherwise we had been in the number of the erroneous: Certainly the Prophets, Gods Messengers, taught us the truth, in saying, the observance of the Commandments of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majesty should render us Heirs of Paradise. Such as shall be saved, shall tell the damned, that they have found the Grace foretold them of God, and we will demand of them, if they have not met with the punishment that his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majesty did denounce against them; they said aloud, Yes, and that the Curse of God is upon the unjust, that mis-led Men from his Law, and they shall be eternally in the number of the miserable. <note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan</hi> Doctors believe, that such as shall have done as much good as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and whose bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the Scale of good works, or of bad, shall dwell in the place call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Aaraf,</hi> with them that have done nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good nor evil; and this place is between Hell and Paradise.</note> Between the blessed and the damned, there is a separation, and a place called <hi>Aaraf,</hi> or Prisons, wherein are many Persons, who know the blessed and the damned by their Countenances, they call to the blessed and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute them, yet they go not into Paradise, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding their great desire to enter. When they turn their eyes towards the damned; Lord, (say they) involve us not in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the unjust. Such as are in that place, call to the damned, they know them by their Visages, and say, to what served your Riches?
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:36900:99"/>
and that ye arose against the Faith, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God? Behold the faithful (whom ye contemned) you swore they should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of mercy; God hath spoken to them, and hath said, enter into Paradise, and fear not, you shall for ever be exempt from affliction; the damned shall cry unto the Blessed, Give us of the water which you drink, and the meats that you eat; they shall answer, The drink and bread of Paradise is prohibited to Infidels, who sported with their Faith, that were proud of the wealth of the Earth, and that scoffed at the Commandments of God; he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten them, because they forgot the coming of the Day of Judgment, and blasphemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Precepts. We are come to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Mecca</hi> to instruct them in the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran;</hi> we teach it unto men, to give them knowledge of the right way, and to acquire the mercy of God, if they believe in that Book: Shall they expect to believe until they know its explication? Its explication shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at the Day of Judgment; that day, such as shall have lived without Faith, shall say, Certainly the Prophets delivered the Truth; shall we partake of their Prayers, will they intercede for us, until we return to the World to do better than we have done, and to obey Gods Commandments? But they shall be damned, because of their Blasphemies. God is your Lord, he created the Heaven, and the Earth in six days, and sitteth on his Throne; he causeth the Night incontinently to succeed the day; the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars, move at his Command, and all the World o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth him; praised be God, Lord of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse: Pray to God privately and publickly,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:36900:100"/>
he abhorreth the unjust; pollute not the Earth, after the Ordure is removed; pray to God to avoid his Chastisements, and obtain his mercy, which is for the righteous. It is God that send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Winds to dissipate the Rain, when they carry the Clouds; we drive them charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with water, into places dry, dead, and rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and cause the Rain to fall there, that they may produce Herbs and Fruits; so will we cause the dead to arise again; perhaps, Men will remember the good Land bringeth forth good Fruits, through the permission of its Lord, and the bad Land produceth only Darnel. I teach my Commandments to such as are not ingrateful: Certainly we sent <hi>Noah</hi> to instruct Men; he said, O ye people, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship one God alone; if you adore other then him, you shall be punished at the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; their Rulers answered, O <hi>Noah!</hi> thou art in a great Errour; He replyed, I erre not, I am a Messenger sent from God to preach his Will; I give you most wholsome Advice, God hath taught me what you know not. Is it strange to you, that he hath sent you his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment by the Tongue of a Man like your selves, to declare to you the torments of Hell? Fear God, he will pardon your sins; But they belyed <hi>Noah,</hi> we saved him in the Ark, with his Retinue, and drowned those that contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our Law, they were altogether blind. We sent <hi>Hod</hi> to his Brother <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>d,</hi> and to his Retinue, he said, O ye people! worship one God alone, whom will ye adore, or whom fear, but God? The Teachers answered, thou art in an extream ignorance; we believe thee to be in the number of Lyars; he replied, I am not a Lyar, I am a Messenger sent from
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:36900:100"/>
God, to preach his Commandments, I give good and salutary Advice, wonder not that God teacheth you his Precepts by the Tongue of a Man, like you, who declareth to you his Pleasure. Remember that he left you on Earth after <hi>Noah,</hi> that he encreased you in number, force, and power; Call to mind his grace, you shall be happy. They answered, are we come to this, to worship one God alone, and to relinquish what our Fathers adored?

Remember thou how <hi>Lot</hi> spake to the People, saying, will you daily defile your selves with Whoredome? and with a filthiness that was never yet seen in the World by any your Predecessors? Will you love Men better than Women? Will you love sin rather than Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? They said, Let us expel <hi>Lot</hi> and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily from our City, for that they will not contaminate themselves with us, but God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him out of their hands, and those of his House, except his Wife, who continued with them that were punished: We caused a Rain to fall upon them, that destroyed all of them. Consider the end of the wicked: We sent <hi>Chaib</hi> to the Countrey of <hi>Madian,</hi> he said, O ye people, worship one God alone, weigh with good Weights, measure with good Measure, and retain nothing from your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: Possess not the high ways, to give ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to the people, neither divert true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers from the Law of God: Remember, that you were but a small handful of Men, and he caused you to multiply; consider the end of the wicked; If any among you embrace the Faith, and others contemn it, have pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, until God judge your differences, there is no better Judge than he; Their Teachers said; O <hi>Chiab,</hi> we will banish thee from <hi>Madian,</hi> thee and those that are of thy Fath, if thou

Then said their Teachers to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if you follow <hi>Chaib,</hi> you are damned; not long after an Earthquake, and Thunder surprized them, and in the Morning they were found dead in their Houses; such as belyed <hi>Chaib,</hi> found no safety in their Habitations, they were wretched, he abandoned them, and said, O ye people! I have preached to you the Will of God with fidelity; I will no longer afflict my self with the Malice of the wicked.

                  </note> City, many Prophets have been sent to its Inhabitants, and wrought many Miracles, yet would they not relinquish their former impiety; thus have we hardned the hearts of Infidels; they violated their Promises, and we found most of them to be wicked and disobedient. We sent <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his people, he to them shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Miracles, which through their Malice they contemned, but consider the end of those wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men; <hi>Moses</hi> said unto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> I am a Messenger sent from God, the God of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse; when I speak of God, I deliver the Truth; I am come, through his Command, to tell thee, thou must dismiss with me the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Israel,</hi> and no longer detain them in thy Dominions. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> said, if thou comest from God, and art true in thy sayings, let us see some Miracles; then he cast upon the ground his Staffe, which was changed into a Serpent, shewed his hand, that appeared ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding white to the eyes of the Spectators. The Doctors of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> said, this Man is a<note place="margin">

He replyed to them, you shall be well rewarded, and shall be of them that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach my Person. They said, O <hi>Moses,</hi> wilt thou first cast down thy Staffe on the ground, or shall we ours? <hi>Moses</hi> bad them cast down
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:36900:102"/>
theirs, which they did, enchanting the eyes of the Spectators, and terrifying them with an extraordinary enchantment; God inspired <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> to cast down his Rod, which devoured the Staves of the other, and the Truth appeared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove falshood, and above the Vanity of their Actions; they were vanquished, to their confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, forsook their Magick, and prostrating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves on the Earth, uttered these words; We believe in the Lord of the Universe, the Lord of <hi>Moses,</hi> and of <hi>Aaron; Pharaoh</hi> said to them, Ye believe in the God of <hi>Moses</hi> without my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission; this is a deceit, invented by you, to drive the people out of my Dominions; but you shall soon know the punishment that I will lay upon you, I will cut off your feet and hands, and command you to be crucified. They answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, We recommend our selves wholly to the Will of God, whatsoever is thy revenge on us, thou shalt not hinder us to believe in the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that we see, neither to obey the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Divine Majesty; Lord give us pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and to die in the number of true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.

leave you alone upon the Earth, he shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold your Actions. We afflicted <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Subjects with Famine, perhaps unbelievers will consider it. When any happiness befel them, they said, they well deserved it, and when they fell into Misery, they affirmed <hi>Moses</hi> and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be the cause of it; It is God that puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed them, but of this most of them were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant. They said unto <hi>Moses,</hi> cease to shew us thy Miracles to inchant us, we will not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey thee: We sent upon them a Deluge, Grass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppers, Lice, Frogs, and Blood, one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; nevertheless they were proud, and in the number of the wicked. When our wrath fell upon them, they said, O <hi>Moses!</hi> call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy Lord, that he give us what to thee he promised, remove his displeasure from us, we will believe thee, and will dismiss with thee, the Children of <hi>Israel:</hi> When we deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them from affliction, they sharpned their Tongues, murmured, and violated their Promises: we avenged our selves upon them, and drowned them in the Sea, for that they contemned our Miracles, and we gave the West and East to the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> who were humble before us; we gave them our blessing, our word was accomplished upon them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their perseverance, and we destroyed the Armies of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> The Children of <hi>Israel</hi> having past the Sea, met with Men that ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Idols, and said, O <hi>Moses!</hi> make unto us Gods, like to the Gods of this people; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, ye are ignorant; these Men are wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what they do is but ignorance and Vanity; shall I desire that you worship other Gods, than God that preferred you to all the World? We have delivered you from <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> people,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:36900:103"/>
who caused you to endure great torments, they murthered your Children, abused your Wives, and you suffer heavy afflictions for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your sins. We detained <hi>Moses</hi> on the Mountain thirty Nights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ten other Nights, which is in all forty Nights; when he went up, he said to his Brother <hi>Aaron,</hi> be thou my Lieutenant, command this people in mine ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and follow not the path of the wicked. When <hi>Moses</hi> at the time appointed arrived at the top of the Mountain, and that his Lord spake to him, he said, Lord permit me to see thee: he said, thou shalt not see me; behold this Mountain, if it continue firm in this place, thou shalt be able to see me; when the Lord appeared upon the Mountain with his light, it was reduced to ashes, and <hi>Moses</hi> ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, fell on the ground as dead. When he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose again, he said, Blessed be the name of God, I desire to obey him, and believe that no Man living is able to behold him. He said to <hi>Moses,</hi> I have chosen, and preferred thee to all the World, I have made thee a Prophet, thou hast talked with me, receive the Grace which I have bestowed on thee, and be not ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. We gave to him the Tables, whereon was written what was necessary for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Men, and we said to him, receive with affection, what I give thee, and command thy people to observe the Contents of those Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. I will precipitate into Hell such as trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress my Commandments; I will deprive the proud of my Graces, they will not believe in my Law, although they see all the Miracles in the World; if they see the right way, they will not follow it; they see the way of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and pursue it; because they have abjured
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:36900:104"/>
my Commandments, and rejected my Grace, the good works of them that disobey me, and that believe not in the Resurrection, are unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, they shall be chastised after their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits. The people of <hi>Moses,</hi> after his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, adored the Calf, a bellowing God; saw they not, that it spake not to them; neither could conduct them into the right way? Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless they adored it, for which they were greatly to blame. When this Calf fell to the ground, and they found their errour, they said, if God have not pity on us, we shall be mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. When <hi>Moses</hi> returned, he said to them, whom did ye obey after my departure? You were too hasty to worship that Idol; he in displeasure cast against the ground the Tables that God had given him, took his Brother by the head, and dragging him to him, said, Son of my Mother, how hast thou governed this people? I wanted power, replyed he, and could not divert them from their evil; It wanted little but they had slain me, do me no harm; rejoyce not my Enemies with my misery, and account me not with those that adored Idols: <hi>Moses</hi> said, Lord pardon me, and my Brother, give us thy mercy; thou art the merciful of the merciful. The wrath of God, and the infamy of the World, shall fall upon them that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped the Calf, and blasphemed against God; he will be pitiful to such as shall repent, and believe in his Divine Majesty. The displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of <hi>Moses</hi> being allayed, he again took the Tables, whereon was written the way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, for such as have the fear of their Lord before their eyes; he caused to be separated from his people, at a time appointed, three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score and ten Persons, who were surprized with
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:36900:104"/>
an Earthquake, and with Thunder; and said, Lord, thou couldest have destroyed them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they adored the Calf; wilt thou destroy us all, because of the sin of the ignorant that are amongst us? Thou hast desired to prove this people; thou guidest, and causest to erre whom thou pleasest; thou art our Protector, pardon our sins; for thou art altogether mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful; give us thy Grace in this World, and guide us to the Day of Judgment, near to thy Divine Majesty: He said, I will punish as I see good, my mercy embraceth the whole World; it is for such as have my fear before their eyes, that pay Tithes, obey my Commandments, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the right way, believe in the Prophet, <note n="*" place="margin">This is <hi>Mahomet.</hi> See <hi>Kit ab el tenoir.</hi>

There are some of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> that knew the truth, and judge with equity. We divided them
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:36900:105"/>
into twelve Tribes, when <hi>Moses</hi> required drink for his People, we inspired him to strike the Rock with his Rod, whence flowed twelve Fountains, and every one knew the place where he should drink; we covered them with the shadow of Clouds; we caused <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> and <hi>Quails</hi> to descend upon them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to eat of the good things which we gave them. They did not hurt us (when they murmured) but afflicted themselves. It<note place="margin">This is the Holy Land. See <hi>Gelal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din.</hi>
                  </note> was said to them, Dwell in this City, and eat therein what shall please you; enter at the gate with adoration, and beg pardon of your sins. I will pardon you, and will aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the graces of the righteous; nevertheless, the wicked that were among them, altered the words that were spoken to them, and perverted them; and we sent upon them our indignation from Heaven, because of their impiety. Ask of them concerning a Village that was upon the shore of the Sea, whose inhabitants obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not the Sabbath, and fished on the day of rest; they saw in that day, Serpents appear upon the water, and other days they saw none. Thus were they tryed, because of their disobedience: A party of them said, Fish not O People, it is lost labour; God shall destroy and chastise them with grievous torments, then their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors said, They shall implore pardon of the Lord, perhaps they will fear to offend him another time. When they rejected what we taught them; we saved such among them as abstained from evil-doing, and grievously af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the wicked, because of their disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; when they gloried in their sin, we said to them, Be ye contemned, and abhorred as Apes; thy Lord shall send to them at the Day
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:36900:105"/>
of Judgment, persons to torment them; he is exact in punishing the wicked, and merciful to the righteous. We sent upon them good and evil, to prove them, peradventure they will be converted. Their posterity left a progeny, heirs of their Doctrine; nevertheless, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their sins, and say, the Lord shall pardon them; they beg pardon of him, and<note place="margin">See <hi>Gelal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din.</hi>
                  </note> return daily to their sin: Shall not account be required from them, of what is ordained in the Scripture? To wit, not to speak of God, but with truth: They have read the Truth, but have not comprehended it. Paradise is only for the righteous; I will not deprive them of recompence, who make their prayers at the time appointed, and observe what is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Scriptures. Remember thou, how we raised a Mountain over them, to shelter them, and how they believed it would fall upon their heads; we said to them, Learn with affection what we teach you, and remember; perhaps you will fear disobedience. Thy Lord caused to come out of <hi>Adams</hi> Reins, all his Posterity; and asked them, saying, Am not I your Lord? they answered, yes, thou art our Lord, we know it well: They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore say at the Day of Judgment, That they knew not his unity; they shall say for excuse, Our Fathers adored many gods before us, we are their Posterity; wilt thou destroy us, because of their iniquity? Thus do I discover my mysteries to Men; it may be they will be converted. Relate to them the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of him that saw our miracles; he was dispoiled of his understanding, the Devil fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it, and he was in the number of the wretched. Had we so pleased, we had exalted
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:36900:106"/>
him through the knowledge of our wonders, among the Doctors; but he crouched to the ground, and followed his own appetite, like to a chafed Dog; if thou chase him with Choler he putteth forth his Tongue; if thou leave him at rest, he will still put forth his Tongue, like to the Infidels, that contemn our instructions; if thou recount to them our miracles, or do not recount, perhaps they will be converted, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they will not be converted, and shall be like such as have abjured our Commandments, and injured their own Souls. He whom God guideth, is well guided; and he whom God mis-leadeth, is in the number of the miserable. We have created Hell to punish Devils and Men; they have hearts, and comprehend not the truth; they have eyes, and see it not; ears have they, and hear it not; they are like to Beasts, and worse than Beasts; they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ignorant. The most beautiful names of the World appertain to God: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech him by the beauty of his name, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from them that depart from the truth, through the names that they impose on their Idols; they shall be chastised after their deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Some there be that follow the truth, and judge with equity. I will by degrees punish them that shall reject our Commandments, when they shall think thereon. I will defer their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment some time, because my wrath is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: Remember they not, that they said, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> is possest of the Devil? On the contrary, he declareth the joys of Paradise, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the torments of Hell. Consider they not the Kingdom of Heaven and of Earth, which God hath created of nothing? The fear of Death shall arrive before they have acknowledged
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:36900:106"/>
their sins; in what will they believe, if they have no Faith in the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Alcoran?</hi> He whom God shall mis-lead, shall find none to guide him; he shall leave Infidels confounded in their disobedience. They shall enquire of thee concerning the Hour and Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Say unto them, No Man knoweth it but God; but the greatest part of the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it not. I have not power to do either good or evil of my self, if God do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it; if I knew the future, I should provide wealth to preserve me from poverty: I am sent only to declare the joyes of Paradise, and preach the torments of Hell to them that believe in God; he it is that created you of one sole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and created his spouse of his Rib, to dwell with her: When she doubted of being with Child, she ceased not to travel as she was wont; but when her conception rendred her heavy, they both besought God, their Lord, and said, Lord give an happy progeny, to the end we may be in the number of them that return thee thanks for thy favours. When God gave them a Son, a righteous Man, they associated him in what he had given them; and all of them exalted the glory of his Divine Majesty, above the Idols of the Infidels, that adored things which could create nothing, that are things created, and can do neither good nor harm. If you call Idolaters to the right way, they will not follow you; if ye invoke Idols, misery shall be upon you; will you be mute, to profess the unity of God? Will you worship the Creatures, instead of the Creator? Go, adore your Idols, and may they hear your prayers, if you believe them to be Gods? Have they Feet to walk, Hands to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:36900:107"/>
touch, Eyes to see, and Ears to hear? Say unto them, If ye invoke your Idols, and conspire against me, you shall find none to protect you, God is my protector, he hath caused the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran</hi> to descend from Heaven, he is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor of the righteous; what ye adore, can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther benefit nor hurt you; If thou invokest I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, they shall not hear thee, they shall look upon thee, and shall not see thee; do what is lawful to be done, command things honest, and depart from the ignorant; if the Devil would seduce thee, trust in God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he heareth and knoweth all things; such as fear him, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his mercies and chastisements when they are tempted of the Devil. Although Infidels know the Truth, the Devil ceaseth not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue them in their sin, they always follow their impiety; If thou goest to them to instruct them, they say, thou singest an old Song, say unto them, I do what my Lord inspired into me, what I teach you, is the light of Faith, the right way, and the grace of God for them that believe in his Divine Majesty; for such as hear the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran,</hi> and study it, perhaps God will give you his mercy. Remember thou God in thy Soul, worship in publick and private, pray unto him evening, and morning, and be not in the number of the ignorant. The Angels that are near to thy Lord, neglect not to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him, they praise and adore him with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</p>

                  </note> They will demand of thee, to whom appertaineth the spoyl? Say unto them, the spoyl appertaineth to God, and his Prophet; Fear God, live with mutual amity, and obey his Divine Majesty, and his Prophet, if you believe in his Law; Such as fear when they hear mention of God, who augment their faith, when they have heard relation of his miracles, who trust in him, who persevere in their prayers, and dispend in pious works some part of their wealth, believe in the unity of his Divine Majesty; they have the degree of their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in Paradise, shall receive from their Lord pardon of their sins, and exceeding great treasure. When thy Lord caused thee to go out of thine House to go against the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, a party of the true believers had a great aversion to sighting, they disputed with thee the necessity of Combates, having seen and known that their Enemies led them to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Death; Call to mind, that God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised you that a party of the Army of the Enemies should obey you.

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:36900:108"/>
that your Lord heard you, when you of him implored succours, and that he assisted you with a thousand of his Angels sent from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; God sent you this aid, only to let you know his grace, and to confirm your hearts; Victory proceedeth from God, he is Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and most prudent: Remember that God covered you with a secure sleep, and caused Water to descend from Heaven, to wash, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and deliver you from the malice of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. Plant in your heart generosity, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and go on with assurance. God hath said to his Angels, I will be with you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the steps of the true believers; I will cast fear into the heart of the wicked, strike them on the head, smite them on the fingers, and feet, because they have contradicted my will, and that of the Prophet. God severely cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiseth such as disobey his Commandments, and oppose the will of his Prophet; the unbelievers have heretofore tasted of his punishments in this World, and shall in the end feel the pains of the fire of Hell. O ye who believe in God! turn not the back to the wicked, as vanquished, when they approach to fight you, he that shall turn the back, shall return in the wrath of God, and be thrown headlong into the fire of Hell. You slew not the Infidels at<note place="margin">See <hi>Gelal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din.</hi>

                  </note> Thou didst not cast Stones against them, God did cast them to advantage the true believers; he understandeth whatsoever they say, and knoweth all their actions: certainly, he will augment the affliction of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. When ye required victory, it was given you; if you relinquish your impiety, you shall do well; if you return to fight against the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:36900:108"/>
Prophet, know that he will protect him against you; your Men of War shall advantage you in nothing, notwithstanding they be numerous; for that God is with the true believers. O ye that believe, obey God and his Prophet, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part not from him, since ye have heard the Commandments of his Divine Majesty, be not as those that say, We have heard, and were deaf and dumb. The ignominy and misery that God layeth on beasts, is to be deaf and dumb, and to want the use of reason: Had God seen any good inclinations in the Infidels, he had not left them in their deafness; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had heard clearly, they should have always departed from his Law, and have been obstinate. O ye that believe in God! obey God and the Prophet, demand life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in your prayers, and know that God will separate the Gall from the Liver; he will se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the Infidel from the True believer, and you all shall appear before him, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compensed and chastised for your works; fear the punishment that shall be inflicted, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally on the seditious, and ingrateful, God is severe in his chastisements; Remember that in the territory of <hi>Mecca</hi> ye were but an handful of weak Men, and with fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken, and destroyed by the unbelievers; God saved, protected, and enriched you with all manner of good things, peradventure ye will give him thanks. O ye that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve! betray not God, nor the Prophet, neither such as confide in you, and have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted their wealth in your hands, otherwise your riches, and Children shall torment you in the other World. There is with God great reward for the righteous. O ye that believe!
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:36900:109"/>
if ye fear God, he shall remove your enemies far from you, and pardon your sins, his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is infinite. The wicked have conspired against thee, to punish and slay thee, or drive thee from <hi>Mecca;</hi> but God hath rendred their conspiracy ineffectual, he knoweth all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of conspirators. When his miracles were related to them, and his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments taught them, they said, we have heard them, we had said the like things, had we so inclined; it is but a Song, and a Fable of old Men: Remember thou, how they said, my God, if what <hi>Mahomet</hi> declareth be true, cause a shower of Flint-Stones to fall upon us, and rigorously chastise us; He shall not chastise them, when thou art with them, neither when they beg pardon of him; Who is he that is able to hinder God to punish them? They are not in his grace, when they hinder True be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to enter the Temple of <hi>Mecca;</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecteth only such as have his fear before his eyes, but most of them understand it not. Their prayers are very light, they go hand in hand in the Temple, but shall one day feel the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, because of their impiety. The unbelievers that expend their wealth to turn the People from the Law of God, shall have sorrow for their expence, they shall be infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and precipitated into the fire of Hell. God shall separate the good from the wicked, he shall cast the wicked headlong into Hell fire, and they shall be in the number of the damned: if they repent, he will remit what is past, and if they return to fight against the Prophet, they shall be entreated as the first: kill them, to avoid sedition, that there may be no Law in the World, but the Law of God; If they forsake their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:36900:109"/>
God shall behold their actions, if they depart from the faith, know, that God alone is your Lord, and Protector. The fifth part of the spoil that you shall gain from your Enemies, appertaineth to God, the Prophet, his Parents, Orphans, the Poor, and to Pilgrims that are in want; observe what is above ordained, if ye believe in God, in what we have inspired into our <note n="*" place="margin">Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</note> Servant, and in the day, wherein the distinction of the good and the bad was known at the encounter of the <note n="*" place="margin">The day of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>

O ye that believe! make an Halt, when you are in view of your enemies Troops, and pray to God with affection, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you shall be happy, obey God, and the Prophet, his Apostle; if disorder and terror surprise you, you shall lose your reputation; persevere, God is with them that continue to do well. Be not like them that went out of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:36900:110"/>
their Houses with dissembled joy, and hypocrisie, and turn the people from the right way, God knoweth all their actions; The Devil caused them to find pleasure in their doings, saying to them, none shall this day obtain victory over you, I will be with you; and when they beheld the two Camps in Battalia, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned on his steps, fled, and said, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of the evil that you commit, I <note n="*" place="margin">The Turks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Devil saw the Angels fight for <hi>Mahomet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

The wicked, and such as were weak in their faith, speaking of the True believers, said, These Men glory in their Law: It was replyed to them, he that relyeth on God, shall find him to be more powerful than his enemies, and that he is most prudent in whatsoever he doth. Thou sawest the Angels that slew the Infidels, they did beat them behind and before, and said to them, taste the torments of the fire which you have merited, God is not unjust to his Creatures. The people of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, and those that preceded them, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the miracles and Commandments of God, but he rigorously chastised them, he is Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, and most severe in his punishments, he shall destroy them that alter the graces he hath given to the People, until they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the grace he hath conferred on themselves. <hi>Pharoahs</hi> people were Infidels, their Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors<note place="margin">See <hi>Kit ab <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </note> disobeyed the Commandments of thy Lord; but we destroyed them because of their sin, we drowned them for that they were unjust; The wicked are like to beasts, they shall never believe in God. Such as promised not to assist the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, and violated their promise, had not the fear of God before their eyes; if thou meet
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:36900:110"/>
them in a journey, separate thy self from them, their punishment pursueth them, peradventure they will consider it. If you fear that any one will betray you, and be wanting to their word, receive no promise from him, neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise him any thing, God abhorreth Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: Believe not that Infidels escape the punishment of God, return with your whole strength to fight against them; the halters of your horses shall terrifie the enemies of God, and of you, and of other persons who ye know not, but God knoweth them all. Your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for his service, shall be payed you, and no injustice shall be done to you; If thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies incline to peace, thou shalt do ill to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, as they, trust in God, he understandeth what they say, and knoweth whatsoever they do; if they desire to betray thee, God shall protect thee; and all true believers endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to unite their hearts; but although thou shouldst expend all the riches of the World, thou shalt not be able to unite them, God shall one day unite them, he is Omnipotent, and prudent in all his works. O Prophet! the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of God sufficeth thee, and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that follow thee. Exhort the true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to fight against Infidels; If ye be twenty assembled with resolution and perseverance, ye shall vanquish two hundred Infidels; if ye be an hundred, ye shall overthrow a thousand, the unbelievers are ignorant; but God will lighten your burthen, he knoweth your weakness; if ye be an hundred true believers, ye shall defeat two hundred Infidels; if ye be a thousand, you shall subdue two thousand by the permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of God, he aideth such as expect his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cors with perseverance. The Prophet cannot
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:36900:111"/>
be a prisoner, he shall establish himself on Earth with advantage, over unbelievers; Ye desire the wealth of the Earth, and God will give you the treasures of Heaven, he is Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent and wise. If God had not taught you his Commandments, ye should have suffered great torments; eat of clean beasts that he hath permitted you to eat, and fear God, he is gracious and merciful to them that have his fear before their eyes. O Prophet! say to them that shall be prisoners in thy hands; God knoweth what is in your hearts, he shall reward you for what ye shall have lost, and shall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don your sins; if you be converted, he is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and merciful. If they betray thee, they betrayed God before thee, separate them from the True believers, God knoweth all things, and is most prudent in what he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth. Such as have believed in God, as have departed from the wicked, as have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed their wealth, and persons to fight for the Law of God; Such as have protected the Prophet, and defended him, are all protectors, and friends to each other; you shall have no consideration of the alliance of the True be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, that desert not the company of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, until they be separated from them. If they require of you succors touching Religion, you are obliged to protect them, except against such as have confederacy with you, God seeth all your actions. The Infidels pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect each other, if you obey them, great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders shall ensue, and many seditions in the Earth. Such as have believed in God, as have deserted the wicked, as have fought for the Law of God, as have established the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and defended him against his Enemies,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:36900:111"/>
are indeed faithful and true believers, they shall receive from God pardon of their sins, and exceeding great treasures. Such as having believed in God, have departed from the wicked, and have fought with you, are yours, they shall be the Heirs of their Parents, God hath so appointed it, he knoweth all things.</p>

Many Mahometan Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors have entituled this the Chapter of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Pain. See the Exposition of <hi>Gelaldin,</hi> and that of <hi>Bedaoi,</hi> and <hi>Kitab el tenoir.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>A Letter Patent from God, and his Prophet, to the unbelievers, with whom ye have made Truce. Travel in safety the space of four Months, know, ye shall not render God impotent, and that he will lay shame upon your forehead. Advice for the People, at the Day of great Pilgrimage, from God, and his Prophet: God approveth not the action
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:36900:112"/>
of them that adore Idols, his Prophet is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent from that sin; If ye repent, ye shall do well, if ye abandon the Law of God, know, ye shall not escape the punishment of your crime; preach to the unbelievers, that they shall suffer grievous torments, except those with whom ye have made Truce, who fall not from what they have promised, and that protect none against you. Observe exactly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the prefixed time, what you have promised them, God loveth them that fear him: When the Month of <hi>Heram</hi> shall be past, kill them where you shall meet them, take them Slaves, detain them Prisoners, and observe where they pass to lay ambush for them; if they be converted, if they pray at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and pay Tythes, leave them in quiet, God is merciful to them that repent. If the Infidels demand Quarter of you, give them Quarter, to the end they may learn the word of God; teach them his Commandments, for they are ignorant. How should they have Truce with God and his Prophet? If they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve neither in the one, nor the other, except them with whom you entred Truce in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Mecca?</hi> If they observe their promise to you, observe what ye promised to them, God loveth such as have his fear before their eyes: How shall they have Truce with you? If they have advantage over you, they will respect nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your alliance nor confederacy; They will speak well of you, and contemn you in their heart, the greatest part of them are impious, they have preferred the riches of this World to the Commandments of God, and have hindred the People to follow his Law, as if they knew not what they did; they bear no respect to the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:36900:112"/>
True believers, wherein they are exceedingly to blame. If they turn, and make their prayers at the time appointed, if they pay Tithes, they shall be your Brethren in God. I teach the mysteries of faith to such as have understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to comprehend them, if they break their promise, and disturb them of your Religion, kill their Captains, as persons without faith, they will perhaps put an end to their impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Slay such especially that renounce their faith, who have endeavoured to drive the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet from <hi>Mecca,</hi> and have begun to slay you, will you fear them? Will ye be terrified by them? It is reasonable that ye fear God; if ye believe in his Law, fight them, God shall cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise them by your hands, he shall render them dishonourable, and protect you against them, he shall fortifie the hearts of True believers, and expel melancholy, he pardoneth whom he seeth good, knoweth all things, and is most prudent in what he ordaineth. Think ye to be forsaken of God, and that he discerneth not them that have fought gallantly for his Law, from such as have adored Idols, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed his Prophet? The True believers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon not their Religion another time to profess it: God knoweth all your actions, Infidels must not enter into the Temple of <hi>Mec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> knowing that they are Infidels, the good works which they shall do in this World shall be unprofitable, and they shall dwell eternally in the fire of Hell. They that believe in God, and the Day of Judgment, that make their prayers at the time appointed, pay Tithes, and worship one God alone, shall visit the Temples of his Divine Majesty, and such as fear the Creatures more than the Creator err from
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:36900:113"/>
the right way; We have ordained that such as shall bear fresh Water to Pilgrims, and them that shall visit the Temple of <hi>Mecca,</hi> shall be in the number of them that believe in God, and the Day of Judgment. Such as fight for the faith are not all equal in graces, and merits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, he guideth not the unjust. Such as have believed in God, as have departed from the wicked, and employed their wealth and persons to fight for his Law, shall have a particular degree, and a particular place near to his Divine Majesty, they shall be the more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. God through his goodness declareth to them, that they shall enter into delicious Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, where they shall remain eternally, there is with God a very great reward. O ye that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve! obey not your Fathers, nor your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that love rather to follow impiety, than the faith. Such as shall obey them, shall offend exceedingly; if your Father, your Children, your Brothers, your Wives, your Parents, your friends, the wealth that you have gained, the fear of losing your riches, and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of poverty, have more of power over you than God and his Prophet, and hinder you to fight for the faith, the Commandment of God shall be executed against you, he guideth not the wicked, and hath protected you in many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. Remember the day of Battle of <hi>Hanin,</hi> when ye rejoyced in the multitude of your Men, it did not advantage you, fear made you find the place too narrow for flight, and ye turned the Back as vanquished: Remember, that God, at that time, put his Prophet, and the true Believers in a place of safety, and sent invisible Troops to chastise the Infidels, he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth sins as seemeth good to him, he is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:36900:113"/>
and merciful. O ye that believe in God! Unbelievers are unclean, permit not that they enter into the Temple of <hi>Mecca</hi> after this year, if ye have apprehension of want, God shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich you with his Grace, if it please him, he is Omniscient and most prudent. Fight against them that believe not in God, nor the Day of Judgment, that forbid not to act what God hath prohibited, and his Prophet hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and that judge not according to the Law of truth, wherein they were instructed, who heretofore received the written Law: they chuse rather to pay Tribute, than to be converted, therefore are they contemptible. The <hi>Iews</hi> have said, that the Son of God is most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; the <hi>Christians,</hi> that the <hi>Messiah</hi> is the Son of God; their words are like to the words of the Infidels that preceded them, but God shall lay upon them his Curse. Consider how they blaspheme; they adore their Doctors, and Priests, and the <hi>Messiah</hi> also, the Son of <hi>Mary;</hi> who commanded them to worship one God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, there is but one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

When God created the Heaven and the Earth, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the year of twelve Months, amongst which four are priviledged.

O ye that believe! wherefore have ye incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Earth? Why did ye prefer the wealth of this World to that of Paradise; when you were commanded to go forth of your Houses to fight for the Law of God? The Riches of this World are contemptible, if you consider those of Heaven; if you leave not your Houses to fight with the Prophet, God shall severely punish you, and put other Persons in your pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; you shall not protect the Prophet, God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is his Protector; he protected him when he went out of <hi>Mecca;</hi> he, with his Companion, they being both in a Cave, he said to his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, afflict not thy self, God is with us; He hath defended, and succoured us by invisible Troops; he hath debased the word of Unbelievers, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted that of true Believers; he is Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and wise. Fight according to your power for the Law of God, you shall do well if you have
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:36900:114"/>
knowledge to understand it; if you require the wealth of this World, Honour, and Reputation, they are not far from you, they follow you at hand, but the punishment of Crimes and Misery are as yet far remote of Infidels; they swear by the Name of God, that they were unable to go out of <hi>Mecca</hi> with the Prophet, in which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy their Souls, for God knoweth them to be Lyars: excuse them not, that thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est not them that spoke truth, and those that were Lyars. True Believers will not excuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from fighting, or employing their wealth and Persons for the Law of God; he knoweth such as fear him. They that believe not in God, neither the Day of Judgment, refuse to go with thee, they doubt the Mysteries of Faith, but shall continue in their doubt, to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion; had they inclined to go out against the Enemy, they had Arms to perform it; God contemned their going out, rendred them neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and caused them to remain with the sick, the Women, and Children; had they gone forth with you, they had brought with them more of disorder than affection to the Service of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majesty; they hate you, nevertheless you hearken to them: God knoweth them that are to blame, they hated thee heretofore, accused thee of all their mischief, until, through the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of God, the truth appeared against their Will: many of them said, excuse us, and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize us not, and they fell themselves into scandal, and impiety: but Hell is the Habitation of those wicked Persons; if good happen to you, they are discontented; if evil befal you, they say, they took heed to themselves, and foresaw i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Be not then amazed at the quantity of their Treasures, neither the number of their Children; God shall make use of them to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them in this World, and shall destroy them with their wickedness. They swear by the name of God, that they are yours, and are not, and fear to be discovered; if they meet with any Den, Cave, or House, wherein to hide them, they speedily repair thither. There be of them that say, it is ignominious to give Alms; if they give Alms it is with Choler; if they gave them for the love of God and his Prophet, they would say, God is our Benefactor; he will give us through his Grace, and to the Prophet, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever shall be necessary, our hope is in him. Alms are appointed for the poor, for them that recommend themselves to God, to redeem Slaves, for such as are in Debt, and necessitous, God knoweth all things, and is most prudent in what he ordaineth. There be among them, who deprave the Prophet, and say, he shall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what we say; say unto them, should it be to you a great advantage to hear well? The Prophet believeth in God, and teacheth true
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:36900:115"/>
Believers the Truth; the mercy of God is for them that believe in his Divine Majesty; Such as detract from the Prophet, shall feel grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous torments; they swear by the Name of God, that they desire to content God, and his Prophet; it is reasonable that they content them, if they be good Men; know they not, that such as transgress the Will of God, and that of his Prophet, shall be eternally damned? The wicked fear lest God should discover to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous the Malice that they conceal in their Souls, and that they contemn them; Say unto them, ye shall be contemned, for God bringeth to light what you fear. If you question them concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they say, they will answer for excuse, that they had no evil intent, and that they but jeast; say unto them, will you jeast with God, with his Commandments, and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets? There is none excuse for you, ye are truely impious; if God pardon any one of you, he shall rigorously punish such as persist to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him. The wicked teach among them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety to their Posterity, they depart from the truth; they go hand in hand, and agree to disobey God; they forget God, and God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth them; he hath prepared Hell for them, where they shall remain eternally; he hath Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them, and they shall feel the torment of infinite pains. The wicked that were before you, shall undergo them like you, they were more powerful than you, they possessed store of wealth, and had many Children, they possessed part of their substance, and ye possess yours, as did your Predecessours; ye were plunged in impiety, as they were plunged; but the good works that they have done in this World, shall be to them unprofitable, and at the Day of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:36900:116"/>
Judgment, they shall be in the number of the miserable. Have they not known the History of their Predecessours; the History of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Noah,</hi> of <hi>Aad,</hi> of <hi>Temod,</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Cities that were subverted? The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets preached to them the Commandments of God, who did to them no injustice; they drew affliction on themselves, through the Enormity of their Crimes. The true Believers mutually obey each other; they command to do what things are honest, prohibit to act what is not approved; they make their Prayers at the time appointed, distribute Tithes, obey God and his Prophet; God shall remit to them their sins, he is Omnipotent, and hath promised to them Gardens, wherein flow many Rivers, and an Habitation full of content in <hi>Eden;</hi> he hath promised them his Grace, which is the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of felicity. O Prophet! fight against the Infidels, fortifie thy self against them, Hell shall be their Habitation; they shall swear by the Name of God, that they have not traduced thee; nevertheless they have detracted and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered words full of impiety: they have denied to have been enriched through the grace of God, and of his Prophet; if they turn, they shall do well; if they abandon the Faith, God shall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them in this World, and in the other, with grievous torments, and on Earth they shall find no Protector; there be of them, who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to capitulate with God, and have said, if God doth good to us, we will believe in him; when he did good to them, they were Niggards, and avaritious; they have erred, and disobeyed his Commandments, but he chastised them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their impiety; he hath imprinted it in their hearts until the Day of Judgment,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:36900:116"/>
for that they have disobeyed him, because they violated their Promises, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their Lies; know they not that God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth what they conceal in their hearts? and that he knoweth what is present, past, and future? There be of them, who deride the true Believers, that give Alms according to their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; God shall deride them, and they shall feel the rigour of eternal pains; implore pardon for them, or implore it not, when thou shalt beg sixty and ten times pardon for them, God shall not pardon them, because they are ingrateful towards him, and his Prophet, God doth not guide them that disobey him; they rejoyced to be left behind the Prophet, when he went to fight for the Service of God, they had an aversion to sight, and employ their Persons and Goods for the Service of his Divine Majesty; they said, we will not go out of our Houses with this heat; say to them, Hell is much more hot, could you comprehend; they shall laugh a little in this World, and shall weep much in the other, for a punishment of their sins. If thou meet them, and they demand permission to go out with thee, to fight for the Faith; say unto them, you shall not go out, neither shall ye ever fight against the Enemy with me, ye were slothful and Cowards the first time, remain with the Unbelievers; pray not for them after their Death, and stay not at their Tombs, because they believed neither in God, nor his Prophet, and died in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Be thou not astonished, neither at the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of their wealth, nor the number of their Children, God will make use of them, to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise them in this World, and will destroy them in their impiety. When command was sent to them to believe in God, and fight with his

Prophet, the most powerful among them desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thee to excuse them, and said, leave us with them that continue in their Houses, and desire to remain with the sick, the Women and little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: God hardened their hearts, and they shall never learn the truth. The Prophet and true Believers that were with them, and fought, and employed their Persons, and goods for the Service of God, shall be blessed; he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them Gardens, wherein flow many Rivers, with perfection of felicity. Some of the <hi>Arabians</hi> came to excuse themselves of going to the War, and such as renounced God and the Prophet, remained in their Houses, but they shall resent grievous torments, because of their wickedness; the sick, the impotent, and those that want means to be present at the War, offend not God in abiding in their Houses, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they be faithful to his Divine Majesty, and his Prophet. The righteous are not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to do but what is in their power, God shall be to them gracious and merciful. Such<note place="margin">Beuou, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cren.</note> as repaired to thee to fight, and whom thou didst dismiss for want of occasion, did not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God; they returned to their Houses with tears in their eyes, with discontent to have wanted means to employ in the Service of his Divine Majesty, the War is appointed to such as intreat thee to exempt them that are rich, and have wealth to subsist, they require leave to remain with their Wives and Children, God hath hardned their hearts, and they know it not; they shall come to excuse themselves, when thou shalt meet them; Say unto them, excuse not your selves, I do not believe you, God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us to understand your News, he and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet likewise hath rendred your good works
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:36900:117"/>
vain and unprofitable; ye shall one day appear before him that knoweth what is past, present, and future, he shall cause you to remember whatsoever you have done, and shall punish you according to your demerits. They shall conjure you by the Name of God, when you approach them, to depart from them; depart from them, they are full of uncleanness, Hell shall be their Habitation, where they shall be tormented for their Crimes. They shall beseech you to love them; if you love them, know, that God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth them that disobey him: The <hi>Arabians,</hi> who observe not the Precepts which God hath sent to his Prophet; are ye more impious and ingrateful? God knoweth all things, and is most prudent. There be Persons among the <hi>Arabians,</hi> who account it lost Money that they expend for the Service of God, and protract their departure, to retard yours, and make you to attend; the Wheel of misery is upon them, God understandeth whatever they say, and knoweth all their Actions; there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them who believe in God, and the Day of Judgment; they esteem that their expence for the Service of God draweth them nigh to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majesty, and they invite the Prophet to pray for them, God shall give them his mercy, he is gracious and merciful to them that obey him. They that first arrived at <hi>Medina,</hi> the first of them that went out of <hi>Mecca,</hi> to depart from the wicked, such as were at the Battel of <hi>Beder,</hi> and such as imitated them in well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, shall injoy the Grace of God, he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them Gardens, wherein flow many Rivers, with supreme felicity. There be <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> about you, and in <hi>Medina,</hi> they affect impiety; you know them not, but I know
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:36900:118"/>
them all, I will chastise them twice on Earth, (to wit, through Ignominy and death) and they shall feel in the other World exceeding great torments. Others there be, that confess their sins, and who do good and evil works; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure God will pardon them, he is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether gracious and merciful; take of their substance for Alms, thou shalt render them righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and shalt purifie them, pray for them, thy Prayers shall procure them the mercy of God, he understandeth and knoweth all things. Know they not, that God accepteth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of his Creatures, that their Alms are pleasing to him, and that he is gracious and merciful? Say unto them, do what shall please you; God, his Prophet, and the true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers shall see what you do, you shall one day appear before him, who knoweth the present, past, and future; he shall make you to know whatsoever ye have done, and shall chastise you after your demerits. There be others that attend the pleasure of God, either his grace, or his wrath, his punishment, or his mercy, God understandeth what is in their Souls, and is most wise. They that esteemed, that the Temple built by Unbelievers, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the righteous, to distinguish the wicked from the good, and to observe such as had before fought against God, and against his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, is the Temple of his Divine Majesty, swear that they desire to do well, and that their intention is most honest, but they are Lyars, and God shall be witness of their falshood; make not thy Prayers in that Temple, make thy Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Temple founded on the fear of God, that is reasonable; there be Persons in that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who desire to be purified, God loveth such
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:36900:118"/>
as have a clean Soul; Who is he that build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth best, he that foundeth his building upon the fear of God, or he who layeth the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his building upon the brink of a Ditch of Sand, which falleth, and ruineth it self? They who esteem the Temple built by Unbelievers, to seduce the people, to be the Temple of God, shall be with that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and with the Infidels, that built it, burnt in the fire of Hell; God guideth not the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, their building shall serve only to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them, God knoweth their design; and is most wise; he purchaseth of true Believers their Souls and Goods, and giveth them Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise; if they be slain, or if they slay when they shall fight for the Faith, they shall have what he hath promised to them in the Old Testament, the Gospel, and in the <hi>Alcoran:</hi> Who better satisfieth what he hath promised, than God? Declare to them that they have made a good purchace, they have gained the height of Felicity. Such as are firm in their Faith, who pray, honour, and worship God, who observe his Commandments, and all true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, shall enjoy the delights of Paradise, with all manner of content. The Prophet, and true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ought not to ask pardon of God for Infidels, notwithstanding they be their Parents, having had knowledge that they are damned, because of their infidelity. <hi>Abraham</hi> prayed not for his Father, untill he had promised him to adore one God alone; when he knew his Father to be an Enemy to God, he declared himself an Enemy to his sin, he ceased praying for him, although he was exceeding charitable, and patient in his afflictions. God mis-leadeth not them that he hath put into the right way, he giveth them to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:36900:119"/>
understand what they ought to do, he knoweth them that deserve to be seduced, and such as merit to be guided through the right way. The Kingdom of Heaven and Earth is Gods, he giveth life and death to whom he seeth good: Who except God shall protect you? he hath given his Grace to the Prophet, and to such as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him in his affliction, although it wanted but a little, that the hearts of many of them inclined not to the party of the Unbelievers, but he pardoneth them; he hath been gracious and merciful to three Persons who deserted the Prophet, and were sorry for their Errour, they knew there was no sure refuge, but in God, he pardoned them, when they were converted,<note place="margin">Kiab bin Malik be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lal bin A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mihe, Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarhe bin Rabia.</note> he is gracious and merciful to such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. O ye that believe! Fear God, be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; the Inhabitants of <hi>Medina,</hi> and the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians,</hi> that dwell about that City, ought not to contradict the Will of the Prophet of God, neither dislike what he approveth, because they have endured neither thirst, nor pain, nor anguish for the Service of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majesty; they have not been trampled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot by their Enemies, they shall irritate the Infidels, and shall receive no displeasure; on the contrary, they shall acquire merit, and perform a good work. God doth not deprive them of recompence that do well, he shall write down their expence for his Service, and the number of the Idols that they shall destroy, for reward of their good works. It is not necessary that all the faithful go to the War, it is sufficient, that of every Lineage, and of every Nation there go a party, while the rest shall learn the Laws and Mysteries of Faith, to instruct their Companions, when they shall return from
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:36900:119"/>
their Voyage, perhaps they will fear the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement of God. O ye that believe in God! fight against them that would cause you to be defiled in impiety, be valiant, and know that God is with them that have his fear before their eyes. When God caused to descend from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, any Chapter of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> some of them said, through disdain, that will encrease the Faith of this people. Certainly it aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth the Faith of true Believers, it rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them, and enflameth the wrath of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majesty upon Infidels, who persist in their pollutions, and dye in their wickedness. They know not that God tryeth the good, once, or twice a year, they will not be converted, it is lost time to preach to them. When God sent from Heaven any Chapter of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> they beheld each others, and said, doth any one see us? They returned in their impiety, and God turned their heart from the right way, for that they would not learn the Truth. God hath sent you a Prophet of your own Nation, who, with Passion, desireth to deliver you from your obstinacy, and is extreamly affected to instruct you in the way of Salvation, God is mild, and pitiful towards true Believers. If they abandon the Faith, say unto them, God is my Protector, there is but one sole God, I recommend my self to the Will of his Divine Majesty, he is the Lord of the Majestick Throne.</p>

               <p>IN the Name of God, gracious and merciful; I am God the merciful. The Precepts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Book proceed from the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: Doth the people wonder that we have inspired a Man to preach to the wicked the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell, and to declare to true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that they shall find true what their Lord to them hath promised? The wicked say, that it is but Sorcery and enchantment. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly God is your Lord, who created Heaven and Earth in six days, and sitteth on his Thone, disposing all things; no Man interceedeth for his Neighbour without his permission, he is your God and your Lord, worship him alone, will ye not consider it? you all shall be one day assembled before him; he promised with truth, that he will cause Men to dye, and raise them again, to recompence such as have believed in his Law, and done good works: The Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers shall drink a boyling drink, and shall endure great torments, because of their impiety. He it is that gave light to the Sun, and brightness to the Moon, that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the signs to know the number of years, the account of Months, and of whatsoever he hath created, these things teach with truth,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:36900:120"/>
the Miracles of his Divine Majesty, to such as have knowledge to understand them; the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Day and of Night, and what God hath created in Heaven and in Earth, are marks of his Unity to them that have his fear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes. They who believe there is no Resurrection, such as place their content in the wealth of this World, they that trust in their Riches, and that are ignorant of the Commandments of God shall be precipitated into the fire of Hell, because of their sins, and the true Believers shall be conducted by his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majesty into delicious Gardens, wherein flow many Rivers, they shall there find what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they shall desire, and shall say at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their Prayers, praised be God; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they shall say, Salvation be to God; and at the end of their Prayers, praise be to God, Lord of the Universe. Although God doth sometimes suddenly chastise Men, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attendeth the time of their Destiny. I will leave them that shall not believe in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, in their Errours, to their confusion; When Man is afflicted, he invoketh us standing, sitting, lying, and in all postures, and when we have delivered him from his affliction, he persisteth in his wickedness. It seemeth good to the wicked to do in this manner, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed their Predecessours when they believed not in the Prophets, neither obeyed the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts that we sent them, and have established you on the Earth in their place after them, to see your Deportments. When thou teachest our Commandments to them that believe not in the Resurrection; they say, that the Precepts of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> are altogether contrary to what thou preachest, and that thou hast altered them;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:36900:121"/>
Say unto them, I have no Will to alter them of my self, I do but what is inspired into me of God, I fear to be punished at the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, should I disobey his Divine Majesty; Say unto them, Had it pleased God, I had neither read, nor taught you his Commandments, I sojourned a long time with you, before I taught you, will you not learn them? Who is more unjust than he that blasphemeth? God doth not aid the Infidels that worship what can neither benefit nor hurt them, and say, their Idols shall intercede for them; will you instruct God in any thing that he knoweth not, of what is in Heaven or in Earth? Praised be God, he hath no Companion. Men were all of one Religion before Infidelity took place, and if God had not said that he would defer the punishment of the wicked until the Day of Judgment, he had already destroyed them in this World, because of their impiety; They say, we will not believe in the Prophet, if God make not some Miracles to appear in him; Say unto them, God knoweth what shall be; expect, I will expect with you: When we gave them to taste of content after their affliction, they had subtilty upon our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments: Say unto them, God is more subtile than you, his Messengers shall write your subtilties; he it is that made Men to travel upon the Earth and Sea; It is he that sendeth them a favourable wind to rejoyce them in their Ships; when Tempest surprizeth them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Waves will overwhelm them, then they invoke God, with desire to embrace his Law, and say, if God doth deliver us from this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, we will believe in his Unity, and return him thanks for this mercy; and being delivered from
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:36900:121"/>
peril, persist in their wickedness. O People! you draw mischief on your selves, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire nothing but the wealth of this World, you all shall appear before us to be judged according to your works; the life of the World is like to the Rain, which we cause to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend from Heaven, it causeth with mixture all sorts of herbage to spring forth, for the nourishment of Men, and Beasts. When the Earth is adorned with Flowers, and enriched with its Fruits, the Inhabitants oftentimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they have the power to cause their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction; then send we our chastiiements Day and Night upon the Earth, and render it as mown, and as if the Day before it had brought no Fruit. Thus do I discover Mysteries to such as have knowledge to comprehend them. They beg their Salvation of God; he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth and putteth in the way of Salvation whom it pleaseth him. He shall not cover the Visage of them that have done good works, they shall appear without shame, and dwell in Paradise, where they shall remain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally; and such as shall have done evil shall be punished after their demerits, they shall be covered with shame, and none shall be able to protect them, they shall be as if a great part of the obscurity of the Night had covered their countenance, they shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the fire of Hell, where they shall dwell eternally.

Say unto them, who enricheth you with the wealth of Heaven and Earth? Who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth life to come out of death, and death out of life? Who disposeth all things in the World? They shall answer, it is God: Say unto them, why have you not therefore his fear before your eyes? God is indeed your Lord; what is there after the Truth, but falshood? How will you depart from his Law? his Word shall be accomplished against Infidels. Say unto them, Have your Idols the power to cause Men to die, and to make them rise again? God causeth them to die, and to rise again; how shall they be able to blaspheme after these reasons? Say unto them, Are your Idols able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct you into the right way? God guideth the People into the way of Salvation; who ought rather to be followed, he that guideth the People into the right way, or he that misleadeth them? What reason have ye to follow the evil way? The greatest part of them follow but their own opinion, but their opinion is not conformable to the Truth; God knoweth all their actions, there is no fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> it confirmeth the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Scriptures, and perspicuously explaineth them; there is no doubt, but it proceedeth from the Lord of the Universe. They say <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> hath invented this Book; say unto them, Come and bring any thing that resembleth it in Doctrine and Eloquence, and call the Idols which ye adore, we shall see if you are sincere;
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:36900:122"/>
on the contrary, they have blasphemed, and have talked of what they understood not, when they heard the exposition of the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran:</hi> Thus did their Predecessors; but consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what is the end of the unjust; There be among them, who will believe in this Book, and others that will not believe; Thy Lord knoweth them that defile the Earth; if they slander thee, say unto them, I will answer with my actions, and ye shall answer with yours, ye are innocent of what I act, and I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of what ye do. There be persons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that have inclination to hear thee, but art thou able to cause the deaf to hear? Should they not be deaf, they would learn no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; Others there be, who look toward thee, but art thou able to guide the blind? should they see clearly, they would not follow the right way; God doth no injustice to Men, they do injury to themselves, through the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of their offences. I will cause them to rise again at the Day of Judgment, as if they had remained but one hour of a day in the Grave; they shall know each other, and the wicked who have not believed in the Resurrection, shall be damned: I will shew thee many of them whom I will chastise; I will cause thee to die before they be chastised, and they all shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before me to be judged; God is witness of their actions, he shall punish them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their demerits; every Nation of the World hath had a Prophet sent from God, who hath judged with reason, and without injustice, the differences that were among them touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion: They have said, at what time shall the wrath of God appear? Say unto them, I, of my self, can neither procure good
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:36900:123"/>
nor evil, if God doth not permit it; every one hath his destiny, when the time of their destiny arriveth, they can neither retard, or advance it one hour. Have ye considered the punishment which God heretofore sent, by day, and by night against the wicked? When ye felt it, ye believed it, and fell into it headlong. It shall be said to the wicked at the Day of Judgment, taste eternal torments; shall you not be punished according to your demerits? They will ask of thee, if the pains denounced against the wicked, and if the Resurrection be matters of Truth? Say unto them, yes, my Lord is most exact in his words, and all the Treasures of the World shall not be able to redeem one Soul. They shall repent of their sins, when they shall feel the punishment of their offences, but shall be condemned without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice; whatsoever is in Heaven and in Earth appertaineth to God, he is exact in his Promise, yet the greatest part of the World do not know him. He it is who causeth to die, and giveth life, and shall assemble Men at the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. O People! God hath sent you instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and remedies for your infirmities; he hath sent a guide to conduct true believers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the way of his mercy; it shall be to them of more advantage, than the treasures that they accumulate: Have ye considered the good things which he hath created for you? Ye have appointed one part to be eaten, and have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to eat of another: Hath God permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you to blaspheme against him? The opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of such as blaspheme against God, shall be but misery at the Day of Judgment; God is full of goodness for the people, but most of them are ingrateful. In whatsoever place thou

art, whether thou teach what is contained in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> or whether thou labour, I am always present, nothing is concealed from thy Lord, of whatsoever is in Heaven and Earth; be it great or little, all is written in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible Book, that explaineth all things. There needeth no fear for such as recommend themselves to God, they shall be exempt from the pains of Hell. The true believers who have his fear before their eyes, shall suffer no torments in the other World; it is declared to them on Earth, that they shall have all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, the word of God admits of no altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they shall enjoy perfection of felicity in Paradise. Afflict not thy self for the words of the impious, vertue proceedeth from God, he understandeth, and knoweth all things; whatsoever is in Heaven and in Earth apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to him: They who worship Idols, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low but their opinion, and are lyars; God hath created the night for repose, and the day for labour; such as hear his Word, find therein marks of his Omnipotency. They have said, Do ye believe that God hath a Son? Praised be God, he is most rich, and hath no need of any person, he possesseth whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is in Heaven, and Earth; you have no reason in what ye alledge; will you speak of God what ye know not?

assemble your Doctors, with your Idols, and conceal not what ye do; go whither you will, ye shall find none to protect you; if ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn my instructions, I require not of you a reward for my pains; I desire to receive of none other than God the Omnipotent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend my self to the will of his Divine Majesty. They slandered <hi>Noah,</hi> then did we save him in the Ark, and them that were with him; we prolonged their posterity on Earth, and drowned the wicked; consider the end of such as heard the Word of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned it. We sent to them other Prophets after <hi>Noah,</hi> they made them to see Miracles, and gave them most salutary instructions; but they did not believe in what they had no will before to believe. Thus I harden the heart of the wicked. We after them, sent <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his Subjects, with our mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, they arose against our Commandments, when the truth was preached to them, and said, it was but Magick and Enchantment. <hi>Moses</hi> said to them, Will you say that the Truth is Sorcery? God doth not assist Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Sorcerers; they said, Art thou, with thy Brother, come to divert us from the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of our Fathers, and to be esteemed on Earth? We will believe in thy words. Then <hi>Pharaoh</hi> commanded to summon the most skilful of his Magicians; they being assembled, <hi>Moses</hi> said to them, cast down what ye have a will to cast down on the ground; having cast down their Cords and Staves, <hi>Moses</hi> said to them, know ye none other thing but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick? God shall render it vain, and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; he abhoreth such as defile the Earth, he confirmeth the Truth through his Word,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:36900:124"/>
although it be against the will of the wicked. Few Men believed in <hi>Moses,</hi> because of their fear to displease <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his Ministers. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was powerful on Earth, and in the number of the wicked. <hi>Moses</hi> said, O Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple! if ye believe in God, resign your selves to his will; they answered, All our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is in God; Lord, do not thou abandon us to the malice of the unjust; deliver us through thy mercy from the hands of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels. We inspired <hi>Moses</hi> and his Brother to dwell some time in <hi>Egypt</hi> with their people, and to make Oratories in their Houses, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to make their prayers, and preach to true believers. Lord, said <hi>Moses,</hi> thou hast enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his people in this World; they go astray from the way of thy Law; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found their riches, and harden your hearts, they will not believe until they see thy judgments, and feel the effect of thy wrath; he said, I have heard the prayers of you both; be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in your Embassie, and follow not the way of the ignorant. We gave passage through the Sea to the Children of <hi>Israel; Pharaoh</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued them with hatred and envy, until his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were drowned. Then said <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> believe there is none other God, but the God of the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> and I wholly recommend my self to his Will. Thou dost now believe in God, O <hi>Pharaoh!</hi> and wert before disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to his Commandments, filling the Earth with they enormities, I have delivered thee from this peril, that thou maist be an example to posterity; for many among the people are ignorant of my Omnipotency. We gave the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> to dwell in places full of delights; and enriched them with the good
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:36900:125"/>
things of the Earth; they knew the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that arose among them touching Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, thy Lord shall judge them at the Day of Judgment. If thou doubtest what we have taught thee, repair to them that have read the Scripture before thee; what thy Lord hath taught thee is most true; be not thou of them that doubt, neither of such as derogate from the Commandments of God, thou shalt be in the number of the wretched. Those whom God will chastise, shall not believe in his Divine Majesty, should they behold all the miracles of the World, until they see the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell. The faith is exceeding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the Cities that have received it; when the Inhabitants of the City of <hi>Ionas</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced it, we delivered them from our punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we delivered them from ignominy, and enriched them until the time appointed; if it pleased thy Lord, all the World should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him; wilt thou abhor the People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they believe in God? No Man can em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the faith without his permission, he send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his indignation against them that disobey his Commandments: Say unto them, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider all that is in Heaven and Earth, miracles and preaching are of no use to such as will not believe; shall they expect what their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors expected? Say unto them, expect, I will expect with you. I will deliver my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and the true believers, from the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell, it is reasonable that I deliver them that obey my Commandments. O Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple! who causeth you to doubt of the Law which I teach you? I will not worship the Idols that you adore, I worship one God alone, who shall cause you all to dye; I will

embrace his Law, it commandeth to profess his Unity, I am not of them that say, he hath a Companion equal to him. Adore not what can neither benefit nor hurt thee, if thou do it, thou shalt be in the number of the unjust. If God will afflict thee, none can deliver thee from affliction; if God will do good to thee, none can deprive thee of his grace, he hath given it to whom seemeth good to himself, he is gracious and merciful. O people! God teacheth you the truth; whosoever shall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the right way, shall save his Soul, and whosoever shall go astray, shall destroy it. I am not your Tutor, I do but what is inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into me; I have patience in my perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, I will expect the judgment of God, there is no better Judge than he.</p>

All the Creatures of the World live of his grace, he knoweth the place of their repair, and the place where they must die, all is written in an intelligible Book, that explaineth all things.

If thou saist to the wicked, that they shall rise again after their Death, they will say, it is but Witchcraft and Sorcery; if we retard some time to chastise them, they say, there is no punishment for their crimes; but they shall not avoid it, in the day when it shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and they shall feel the rigour of the pains which they contemn. If we confer riches, and health on the impious, and deprive them of them, they despair in their impiety; if we give them good after their evil, they say, misery hath forsaken them, they rejoyce, and become arrogant. Such as are humble and patient in their afflictions, and do good works,

Perhaps thou wilt forget to teach something of what I have inspired into thee, and be afflicted, because they say, that what thou speakest shall bring thee no profit.

I will bestow the riches and honours of the Earth, on many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that affect them, and in the end they shall be confined in the fire of Hell, and the good works that they shall do in this World, shall be unprofitable in the other.

that have mis-led the people from the right way, they were indeed Infidels. Such Men shall not escape the punishment of their crimes on Earth, they shall find none that is able to protect them but God, he shall augment their pains, because they would not abandon their wickedness, neither receive the light of faith. Such are miserable Men, their Idols shall not afford them succors, they doubtless shall be eternally damned: and such as shall believe in God, do good works, and be converted, shall dwell for ever in Paradise. The wicked are as deaf, and blind, and the True Believers are like those who have good sight and perfect hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; shall they be in parallel to each other? will ye never consider it? We sent <hi>Noah</hi> to reprove Men for their sins, he said to them, worship but one God alone, otherwise I fear ye shall be chastised at the Day of Judgment; The Doctors of the Infidels answered him, we see thee to be a Man, like us, and that such as follow thee are Poor People, blind, and without counsel; we perceive not that thou hast any grace, that ought to prefer thee to us; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise, we believe thee to be a lyar; he said, O people! know ye not that God hath taught me what I preach to you, that he hath given me the grace of Prophecy, and deprived you of it? Shall I exhort you to acknowledge his grace, seeing you abhor him? O People! I require no recompence of you for my pains, God will reward me largely, I desire not to banish True Believers from my company, they shall one day appear before their Lord, but I perceive that ye are ignorant.

They said, O <hi>Noah!</hi> we have a long time disputed together; if thou art sincere, let us see the pains which thou preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to us; God, said he, when it shall please him, shall cause you to see them, you shall not escape them, my instructions shall be to you unprofitable; if God will prove you, he is your Lord, and you shall one day be assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled before him to be judged.

When our will was to destroy that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the light of the morning appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Water boyled in <hi>Noah</hi>'s Pot, we commanded him to charge his Ark with two Beasts of every kind and Species; all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were destroyed, except those, of which we before made mention, as well such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,

I teach what shall be, what neither thou, nor thy people have not yet known; be patient in thine afflictions, Paradise is for them that have my fear before their eyes. We sent <hi>Hod</hi> to the People of <hi>Aad,</hi> his Brother; ye said unto them, O People! a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore but one God alone, otherwise ye shall be in the number of Infidels, I require of you no recompence for the pains I take in preaching to you, he that created me, shall reward me; will ye never be wise? implore pardon of God, be converted, and obey his Divine will, he shall send you Rain from Heaven, and shall encrease your strength, and riches, be not in the number of the wicked; they answered, O <hi>Hod!</hi> thou shewest us no reasons to prove thy sayings, thy words shall not make us to quit our Gods, we give no credit to thy discourse, and tell thee, that some one of our Gods shall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely chastise thee; He said, take God and your selves to witness that I am innocent of the sin that you commit, in adoring Idols; if you conspire against me, none shall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to protect you at the Day of Judgment, I recommend my self to the will of God, mine and your Lord, he conserveth all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Earth, and loveth them that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the right way.

When we destroyed that people, we

Our Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that came to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s House, declared to him the Birth of <hi>Isaac, Iacob,</hi> and their Posterity; they mutually saluted, when they entred into his House, he caused roasted flesh to be brought to them to eat, and perceiving that they did not eat, contemned them in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and was terrified with their coming; they said unto him, fear not, we are sent to <hi>Lot,</hi> to extirpate the Inhabitants of his City; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s Wife being present, began to laugh, when they foretold the Birth of <hi>Isaac, Iacob,</hi> and their Posterity; she said, ah God! shall I bear a Son, I, who am old, and have an Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band extreamly aged? this would be a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; they answered, are ye astonished at the power of God?

My Son, said his Father, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver not thy Dream to thy Brothers, they will conspire against thee, the Devil is an open E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to Men, thou shalt be elected of the Lord in this World, he shall teach thee the explication of Dreams, he shall accomplish his

Grace upon thee, and upon the Lineage of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> as he did accomplish it upon thy Fathers, <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Isaac;</hi> the Lord knoweth all things, and is most wise. The History of <hi>Ioseph</hi> shall serve for example to Posterity; remember thou, how his Brothers said, our Father loveth our Brother <hi>Ioseph</hi> more than all us together, he is in an exceeding great errour, let us kill <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and cast him into some secret place remote from us, his absence will render the Face of our Father more gentle toward us; after his death we will be converted. One of them said, you shall not do well to kill him, but cast him into the Well, some Passengers will take him, and carry him into an unknown Countrey: They said to their Father; Father, wherefore dost thou not send <hi>Ioseph</hi> into the Fields with us? we will be very careful, he shall sport and recreate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; I fear, said he, that ye will neglect to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve him; dost thou fear (said they) that a Wolf should devour him in our Presence, and that we want strength to defend him? In the Morning they led him with them, and cast him into a Well. We inspired him to Prophesie to them what should befal them for the mischief they acted, but they wanted knowledge to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it; they in the Evening returned to their Fathers house, with eyes full of dissembled tears, and said unto him, Father, we sported, and ran who should run the best, <hi>Ioseph</hi> remained with our Baggage, a Wolf came that devoured him; thou wilt not believe us although we speak the truth; then they shewed him his Shirt, which they had sprinkled with Blood; it is you that hath done it, said he, you shall answer before God, he is my Protector, and was patient, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lamenting.

near to that Well, who desiring to draw water to drink, let down a Bucket, on which <hi>Ioseph</hi> took hold to get out; they gave him Cloathes, led him away secretly, and sold him at a good rate for ready Money; they would not kill him, in which they were honest Men. He that bought him in <hi>Egypt,</hi> commanded his Wife to have care of him, that he might one day be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for their Service, and be to them instead of a Son. Thus did we establish <hi>Ioseph</hi> in the Countrey of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and taught him the exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Dreams, thy Lord is Omnipotent, but few Men know him: when <hi>Ioseph</hi> came to the Age of Manhood, we gave him knowledge and prudence; thus do we reward the righteous. His Masters Wife became amorous of his Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, she one day shut him into her Chamber, and solicited him with love; God defend me (said he) to betray my Master, and be unchaste (he was in the number of the righteous) and fled to the Door; his Mistress ran after him, and to stay him, tore his Shirt through the back: She met her Husband behind the Door, to whom she said, what other thing doth he merit, who would dishonour thine house, than to be imprisoned, and severely chastised? Lord, said <hi>Ioseph,</hi> she sollicited me, that Infant which is in the Cradle, and of thy Parentage shall be witness: Then the Infant in the Cradle said, if <hi>Ioseph's</hi> Shirt be torn before, she hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken truth, and <hi>Ioseph</hi> is a Lyar; if the Shirt be rent behind, <hi>Ioseph</hi> hath delivered the truth, and she a lyar: then her Husband beheld <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph's</hi> Shirt torn behind, and knew that it was extream malice, and said to <hi>Ioseph,</hi> take heed to thy self, and beware this act be not divulged, do thou, speaking to his Wife, implore pardon
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:36900:133"/>
for thy fault, thou art truly guilty. The Women of the City said among themselves, that the rich Man's wife was amorous of his Slave, and that she had sollicited his love, and had erred from the right way, which she understanding, made them an exceeding fair Feast, and caused <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> to enter the Parlour where they sate; while they carved their meat, they were so surprized, and entangled with <hi>Iosephs</hi> beauty, that they instead of carving their meat, cut their fingers. O God! said they, this is not a Man, but an Angel; then said she unto them, behold him whom I loved with so much Passion: she ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time importuned him, to satisfie her desire, and perceiving that he would not condescend to her Will, menaced him with the Prison, and to make him miserable: O God! said <hi>Ioseph,</hi> I had rather be a Prisoner, than do what she desir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, deliver me from her Malice, defend me from inclining to her lubricity, and from being in the number of the wicked: his Lord heard his Prayer, he understandeth and knoweth all things. This Woman seeing <hi>Ioseph's</hi> resolution, judged it requisite to imprison him for some time; he was put Prisoner with two Men, one of which told him that he had dreamed that he prest Grapes to make Wine; the other said, that he dreamed that he carried Bread upon his head, which the Birds did eat, they demanded of him the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of their Dreams, because he seemed to them to be a good Man; he said to them, before ye Breakfast, I will interpret your Dreams. I will first tell you what God hath taught me, and how I quit, and abandon the Law of Infidels, and embrace the Law of our Fathers, <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> we ought not to worship many Gods; such as believe in the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:36900:134"/>
Unity of God, are endued with his Grace, but few Men give him thanks. O Prisoners! who hath more power, Idols, or one sole God, who is Omnipotent? The Gods which ye adore are but Idols, whom ye and your Fathers call by such a Name, as seemeth good to you, ye have no reason to worship them; God doth not enjoyn you this, he commandeth you to worship him alone; this is the right way, but the greatest part of the World of this are ignorant. O Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners! the one of you shall give Wine to drink to his Master, the other shall be hanged, the Birds shall feed on his head, the interpretation that ye have required shall be accomplished. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought him that should be saved, to remember him when he should be near to his Master; but the Devil caused him to lose the remembrance of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who remained Prisoner the space of nine years: At that time the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> saw in a Dream seven fat Kine, which seven lean Kine devoured; and seven green ears of Corn, with seven dry ears, of which he required the interpretation of his Doctors; they answered, that the Dream was very obscure, and that they knew not the interpretation; the Prisoner that had been set at liberty, said, that he would forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with give the interpretation of the Dream, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and calling him unto him, said, O righteous Man! explain unto us what is the signification of seven fat Kine, devoured by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven lean, and seven green ears of Corn, and as many dry, peradventure I shall return to the King and his people, and they shall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the interpretation of this Dream. <hi>Ioseph</hi> said to him, ye shall sow the Earth seven years following, which shall abound in Fruits, preserve your Harvest in the ears, and take only what
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:36900:134"/>
shall be necessary for life; after this, there shall come seven years barren, and unfruitful, in which the people shall suffer much. The King of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> having learned the interpetation of this Dream, commanded to call <hi>Ioseph;</hi> the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger said unto him, O <hi>Ioseph!</hi> return to thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and require of him the meaning of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who did cut their fingers, he hath know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their Malice, hath caused them to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble, and demanded of them what was their design, when they sollicited thee with love; they answered, they knew no sin in thee, and his Wife confessed the truth, saying, she had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned thee, but that thou art a very just Man. <hi>Ioseph</hi> answered, by this it appears that I am no Traitor to my Master in his absence, God guideth not Traitors; I will not say, I am a Man without sin, the Spirit of Man inclineth to evil, except such to whom God had given his particular Grace, he is gracious and merciful to whom seemeth good to him. The King having talked with <hi>Ioseph,</hi> entred him into the number of his Domesticks, and made him super-inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of his <note n="*" place="margin">All the Revenues of the Crown.</note> revenues, because he knew him to be a Man of Spirit, faithful, and thrifty. We, by our especial Grace, established <hi>Ioseph</hi> in the Countrey of <hi>Egypt,</hi> where he did what seemed good to him. I deprive not the righteous of their reward on Earth, the recompence of the other World is yet greater for them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in my Law, and have my fear before their eyes. The Brethren of <hi>Ioseph</hi> returned to buy Corn; he said to them, when ye shall come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, bring with you your young Brother by the Father, you shall find I will make you good measure, and lodge well my Guests; if you bring him not, there shall be no Corn for you, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:36900:135"/>
not this Kingdom without him: They answered, Lord, his Father loveth him exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, nevertheless we shall endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what thou enjoynest us; he commanded his Servants to put their money for Corn in the bottoms of his Brethrens Sacks, perhaps, said he, they will return, or acknowledge this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour when they shall come into their Countrey. When they arrived at their Father, they said, Father, there is no more Corn for us, if our young Brother go not with us, if he go thither, we shall have good measure, and we will be careful of him. You will be careful, said he, as you were heretofore of your Brother <hi>Ioseph;</hi> God will defend him better than you, he is the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful of the merciful. When they poured forth their Corn, they found their Money at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of their Sacks, and said, our Father, what shall we desire more, our money is restored to us, and we have Bread for our Family, permit that our Brother go with us, we shall have better measure, that is a small thing to the King of <hi>Egypt;</hi> I will not send him with you unless ye all swear before God to bring him back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, if there be no great impediment. They swore to fulfil his Will; then said he, I take God to be witness of your Oath: O my Sons! enter not all together into the City, but go in at several Gates, to the end the people may not be jealous of you; God commandeth what to him seemeth good, I relye on him, all true Believers ought to resign themselves to his Divine Will; they entred the City as their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enjoyned them, to content him; being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived before <hi>Ioseph,</hi> he took his little Brother by the hand, and said to him, trouble not thy self for what shall become of thy Brethren; having
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:36900:135"/>
filled their Sacks, he caused a Cup adorned with precious stones to be put into the Sack of his little Brother; caused it to be given out, that they of the <hi>Caravan</hi> had stoln the Kings Cup; and sent Men after them to search; those strangers protested they saw it not, and that they came not into <hi>Egypt</hi> to steal, that they were Sureties for each other, and that he who had stoln it, deserved punishment. The Cup was found in the Sack of his young Brother; he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him to be apprehended, and accused them all of Theft; Lord, said they, his Father is old, he will be extreamly afflicted for his absence, take one of us in his place, thou shalt in the end find us to be honest Men: God forbid, said he, that I should detain other than him who was found guilty of Theft, that would be injustice; finding themselves out of hope to free their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they saved themselves in a secret place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the City; where the eldest said to his Brethren, you know the Oath we took at our departure, and how heretofore we intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Ioseph,</hi> I will not go out of <hi>Egypt</hi> without my Fathers permission, God is most just, he shall dispose of me and my Brother as shall please him, return to your Father, and say unto him, thy Son was taken in Theft, we saw him, and endeavoured to our power to deliver him, they of the <hi>Caravan</hi> shall be Witnesses. <hi>Iacob</hi> said at their return, they were the cause of that acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that did not displease you; and he took patience, saying, God perhaps will favour my Sons to return in health; he knoweth in what condition I am, he is most prudent in what he ordaineth. He retired from among his Sons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly afflicted, and bewailed the loss of his Son <hi>Ioseph;</hi> had his eyes continually covered
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:36900:136"/>
with tears, and he bore in his heart great sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. His Sons said unto him, Dost thou yet remember <hi>Ioseph,</hi> to add to thy grief, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten thine end? I am (said he) extreamly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate, I leave all to the Will of God; he hath taught me what ye know not. My Sons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and enquire tidings of your two Brethren, despair not of the Spirit of God, none despair of Gods Spirit, but the wicked. When they came unto <hi>Ioseph,</hi> they said unto him, The Famine that is in our Countrey, hath extreamly afflicted us, it hath often constrained us to come to buy Corn; thou, of thy favour, hast made us good measure; thou hast caused our Money to be restored for Alms, God will reward thee, he recompenceth such as are Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers. He said unto them, Ye remember what ye did unto your Brother <hi>Ioseph:</hi> They reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Certainly thou art not <hi>Ioseph.</hi> I am <hi>Ioseph,</hi> said he, and behold my Brother <hi>Benjamin.</hi> God hath given us his Grace; he rewardeth him that hath his fear before his eyes, and is patient in his afflictions; he depriveth not the righteous of recompence. God, said they, hath poured his favours upon us in saving thee, whom we have exceedingly offended. Be not (said he) ashamed, God this day pardoneth you that sin, he is gracious and merciful; return to your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and bear to him this Shirt, cast it upon his face, he shall recover sight, and return hither with him, and with your whole Family. The <hi>Caravan</hi> was then half way upon return, when <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> said to them that attended him, I smell the odour of my Son <hi>Ioseph;</hi> you deride me, but what I speak is most true: They told him, that he was still in his old Errour; some days fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, one of his Sons arrived with tidings of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:36900:136"/>
                  <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and cast the Shirt that he had given him, upon him; and incontinently he recovered his sight, and said, Did I not always tell you, that I knew what ye knew not; they said, Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pardon us, and ask the forgiveness of God for us, who have exceedingly offended him: He answered, I will beg pardon of God for you, he is gracious and merciful. When they arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before <hi>Ioseph,</hi> he took his Father by the hand, saying, Enter without fear into <hi>Egypt,</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him to sit down, and his Brethren fell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate before him. My Father, said he, behold there the interpretation of mine old Dream, God hath rendred it true, he hath favoured me, in delivering me from Prison, and conducting you hither; he hath put an end to the jealousie wich the Devil had procured between me and my Brethren. The Lord is liberal to whom seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good to him; he knoweth what is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for his people, and is most prudent in what he ordaineth. Lord, thou hast given me wealth, and knowledge to interpret Dreams.

We sent aforetime none but Men to instruct the people; will not Men consider what hath been the end of the wicked that were before them? Paradise is for them that are righteous; will ye not be converted? They caused the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to lose all hopes of their Conversion, and believed them to be Lyars; but we protected them, and delivered from their Malice such as seemed good to us. Nothing shall exempt the wicked from the punishment of their pains; they shall serve for example to Men of Spirit.

               <p>IN the Name of God, gracious and merciful; I am the most wise and merciful God. These Precepts are the Precepts of the Book sent to thee from thy Lord; it is a thing most true, but few Men incline to believe it. It is sent from God, who raised Heaven without a Prop, and with a Column, that appeareth, and sitteth on his
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:36900:137"/>
Throne, disposing all things. He causeth the Sun and Moon to move, until the day appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; he disposeth all things at his will, and manifesteth to Men the signs of his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency. Peradventure you will believe in the Resurrection of the flesh. He it is that hath extended the Earth, raised the Mountains, caused the Rivers to flow, who created of all sorts of Fruits, the Male and Female, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Day with the obscurity of the Night. These things are signs of his unity to such as consider them. He hath created many Fields of divers sorts, and Gardens filled with Grapes, and many different Fruits; he created Date Trees, thick as Groves, and Forests, and others that are scattered through the Fields; some are moistened with Waters, and others have a more pleasing taste. These things are signs of his unity to such as consider them. Thou art amazed at the lies of Infidels, be asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished at their discourses; when they deny the Resurrection, and say, What, shall God yet once again create us of the dust of the Earth? When we shall be Earth, shall we be a new peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? They are impious, they shall have Oaks upon their Necks, and shall remain eternally in the fire of Hell; they precipitate themselves into eternal pains, and contemn the mercy of God, so did their predecessors; but God is gracious to such as convert. Chastise severely the obstinate Infidels. They have said, We will not believe in the Prophet, unless we see some miracle to appear. Say unto them, I am not sent but to preach the word of God. He hath sent persons to every Nation, to teach them the right way; nothing is hid from him in the World; he knoweth what Women bear in their
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:36900:138"/>
Womb; he knoweth the time and period of every thing, the present, past, and future; he is great and Omnipotent. He understandeth what you keep secret, and what ye make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest; he knoweth where they be who cover themselves with the obscurity of Night, and them that travel in the clearness of Day; every one hath his guardian by his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who observeth what he doth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priveth none of grace, that hath not offended his Divine Majesty, and none can hinder him to punish whom it seemeth good to him. He it is, who giveth you to see the lightning which ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth Men, and nourisheth his Creatures by the Rain which he causeth to fall; he created the Clouds charged with moysture, causeth Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to make a noise, darteth the Thunderbolt, and striketh whom it pleaseth him; the Angels tremble in his Presence, yet do the wicked dispute his Omnipotency. He it is who ought to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored; the prayers of them who implore ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God are ineffectual, they are like to such as are very thirsty, and stretch forth the hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Fountain, to which they cannot reach; the prayers of the wicked are impiety: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is in Heaven and in the Earth, the shadow of the Morning, the obscurity of the Evening humble themselves before God, through force or affection. Say unto them, Who is the Lord of Heaven and Earth, but God? Who, except God shall protect you? your Idols can neither benefit, nor hurt you: Is the blind like unto him that seeth clearly? Is darkness like unto light? Shall they adore the Creatures instead of the Creator? God hath created all things, and is Omnipotent; he causeth Rain to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend from Heaven, and Rivers covered with
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:36900:138"/>
Foam, to flow in the Valleys. The Gold, the Silver, and Metals which ye melt to adorn and enrich your selves, are like unto Froth. Thus doth God teach what is profitable, and what unprofitable; Froth suddenly vanisheth, and is of no utility to Men: So falshood vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before Truth. Thus doth God speak through a Parable, to them that obey him, and giveth them Paradise. All the riches of the Earth, and as much again, cannot ransom the Infidels, they shall be eternally tormented in the fire of Hell. Who knoweth, that the truth contained in this Book, was not sent to thee from God? He that doubteth is blind; Men of Spirit do not doubt. They who satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie what they promise to God, who transgress not his Commandments, who have his fear before their eyes, who apprehend the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who are patient in their afflictions for love of his Divine Majesty, who make their prayers at the time appointed, who give alms privately and publickly, and blot out their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences with good works, shall be blessed. They shall enter into the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> with their Father, their Wives, and Families; the Angels shall visit them, shall salute them, and say, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the recompence of your perseverance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold eternal grace. Such as shall swerve from their promise, and disobey the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and pollute the Earth, shall be accursed of God, and severely chastised; he giveth, and depriveth of wealth, as seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good to him. The unbelievers rejoyce in the riches of the Earth; but those riches are of little value, if they consider them of the other World. They say, If <hi>Mahomet</hi> doth not make some miracle to appear from God, we
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:36900:139"/>
will not believe him. Say unto them, God guideth, and mis-leadeth whom it pleaseth him; he confirmeth the hearts of them that have faith in his Law; the remembrance of God confirmeth the hearts of True Believers: Such as shall do good works, shall be happy. We have sent thee, as we did send other Prophets, to them that preceded thee. Teach the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple what we have inspired into thee: When they shall disobey thee, say unto them, God is my Lord, there is but one God alone, I am wholly resigned to his Divine Will; my refuge is in his goodness. If the <hi>Alcoran</hi> should make Mountains to go, should it cause the Earth to open, and the Dead to arise, all would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from God. True Believers ought not to despair of any thing, God shall guide all the World into the right way when it shall please him; and unbelievers shall not escape the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of their crimes. Thou shalt dwell with them until the word of God be fulfilled: He swerveth not from what he promiseth; they derided the Prophets that came before thee, I prolonged the time of their punishment, and in the end rigorously chastised them; and with what afflictions? Doth not God behold the actions of every Man? They have said, God hath Companions, to whom they have given names after their fancy; will you instruct God in any thing? The wicked take delight in their wickedness, and are gone astray from the right way. He whom God shall mis-lead, shall find none to guide him, he shall be afflicted in this World, and yet more in the other. None shall be able to save him, but God; Paradise is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to them that have his fear before their eyes; they shall enjoy eternally all manner of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:36900:139"/>
content, such is the end of the righteous; and Hell is prepared for Infidels. They, to whom we have given the knowledge of Scriptures, rejoyce in the Doctrine which we have sent thee; there be that abjure one part; say unto them, I recommend unto you only the worship of one sole God, who is the assured refuge of the righteous. We have sent the <hi>Alcoran</hi> in the <hi>Arabick</hi> tongue, to the end the <hi>Arabians</hi> may comprehend it: If thou dost follow the will of unbelievers, having had the knowledge of the unity of God, who shall be able to save or protect thee? We sent Prophets before thee, commanded them to marry, and they had Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Prophets cannot perform miracles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the permission of God, and the end of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing is written in his Book; he blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out, and leaveth permanent what seemeth good to him, he cannot alter. I perceive that some of the wicked have a design to murther thee; thou art obliged only to preach to them, I will keep an account of their sins to punish them. See they not that their Countries and possessions diminish daily through thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests? God commandeth what pleaseth him, no Man can escape his judgments, he is most exact in his account: their predecessors used subtilties as they, but God is more subtile than they; he well knoweth the good and evil which every one doth: they shall one day understand who must have Paradise. They say thou art no Prophet, say unto them, It is sufficient that God is witness of the truth between you and me; who is he that knoweth what is written in the Book of his Divine Majesty?</p>

               <p>IN the name of God, gracious and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; I am the merciful God. That Book! We have sent it to thee to bring the People out of darkness, to guide them to the light, and the way of thy Lord, always victorious and glorious; Whatsoever is in Heaven, and in Earth, is Gods; misery is upon unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, they shall undergo at the end of the World exceeding great torments. They who prefer the wealth of this World to that of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, who go astray from the way of the Law, and would pervert it, are in a great error, far from truth; The Prophets spake the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of them to whom they were sent to instruct them, God guideth and mis-leadeth whom to him seemeth good, he is Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and prudent. We sent <hi>Moses</hi> with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies, to bring the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> out of darkness, and to conduct them to light, he taught them the Commandments of the Law, to serve for instruction to such as shall persevere to do well, and shall not be ingrateful for the favours they have received. <hi>Moses</hi> spake to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and said, Remember the grace of God towards you, he delivered you from the Men
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:36900:140"/>
of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who caused you to suffer great afflictions, who murthered your Children, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused your Wives, and laid upon you great evils (sent from God, because of your sins.) The Lord hath said, if ye be not ingrateful, I will augment my graces upon you; if ye be impious, you shall be afflicted. <hi>Moses</hi> said to his people; if you and all Men be impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, know, that God will be always glorious, and hath no need of you. Know ye not what befel (before you) the people of <hi>Noah, Aad, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mod,</hi> and their Posterity, that none had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of but God, because of their great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber? He sent them his Commandments by his Prophets, they bit their fingers for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and said unto them, we renounce, and condemn your Doctrine: The Prophets said unto them, is there any doubt in the belief of the unity of God, Creator of Heaven, and Earth? he calleth you to remit your sins, and deferreth your punishment until the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: They answered, Ye are Men like unto us, will you hinder us to adore the Gods of our Fathers? Produce arguments of strength sufficient to prove what you preach; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet replyed, We are Men as you are, but God giveth his grace to whom seemeth good to him; we are come to you through his permission, the true believers ought to trust in him; wherefore should we not be resigned to the will of God, who hath guided us into the right way? we will continue in well-doing, the righteous trust in his Divine Majesty. Then said the Infidels unto them, we will banish you from our Country, if you be not of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but God inspired into them, that the Infidels should perish, and that they should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:36900:141"/>
the Land after them; that he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect such as should have his fear before their eyes, and fear the pains that are prepared for the wicked. The Prophets were protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God, and the obstinate wicked were destroyed: they shall be precipitated into Hell, and drink of Water full of Corruption, Urine and Blood; Death shall appear on all sides be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes, before they have swallowed that Drink; they shall not dye in that misery, they shall suffer yet greater pains. The good works which the wicked have done, are like to Dust carried away by an impetuous Wind, they shall be unprofitable to them, and they shall be extirpated, because they depart from the truth: See they not that God hath created Heaven and Earth? that he can destroy them, and create in their place a new people, if it seem good to him? This is not difficult to God, all things are known to him. The more impotent of them that have followed the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, shall say at the Day of Judgment, we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed you, will you this day deliver us from the punishment of God? They shall answer, had God guided us into the right way, we had conducted you thither, we are alike mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable with you, we cry and lament in our misery, but find neither refuge nor protection. The Devil shall say unto them, what God hath promised to you is infallible, I foretold it to you, I caused you to transgress his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments through my temptations; I had none other power over you, but to tempt you, you did me no harm when ye hearkened to me, you drew mischief on your selves, I am not your Tutor, neither are you mine, I was impious, when heretofore I suffered you to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:36900:141"/>
adore me; Hell is prepared for you, and for all unbelievers, there shall they endure great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the righteous shall enter into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, wherein flow many Rivers, where they shall dwell eternally, with all manner of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness and content; Seest thou not how God speaketh by a Parable? A good word is like to a good Tree that hath taken Root in the Earth, and hath raised its Branches to Heaven, and produceth its Fruit in due time, through the permission of his Divine Majesty; he teacheth the people his Parables, perhaps they will be mindful: An evil word is like to a bad Tree, that hath been torn from the Earth, there is nothing to sustain it, and it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Root, or Fruit: God fortifieth the true believers through his word in this World, and in the other, and causeth the unjust to err, he doth what to him seemeth good: Seest thou not them that have changed his grace into impiety, and have made such as have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to dwell in the House of perdition? They shall abide eternally in the fire of Hell. They say, that God hath a Companion equal to him, and err from the way of his Law; Say unto them, ye shall have wealth in this World, but Hell is your Rendezvous. Say to the true believers, who make their prayers at the time appointed, and give alms in private, or publick, that the day shall come wherein they shall neither buy nor sell, and where eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one shall be recompensed for his works. Say unto them, God hath created the Earth, and the Heavens, he maketh the Rain to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend from Heaven, which causeth to spring sorth all sorts of Fruits to enrich you, he created the Ship, that through his permission
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:36900:142"/>
saileth on the Sea, he created the Rivers, the Sun and the Moon, which move continually, he created the Day and the Night, and bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on you whatsoever ye desire, his favours towards you can neither be numbred, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, nevertheless the inhabitants of <hi>Mec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> are always impious and wicked; <hi>Abraham</hi> said, Lord protect this City, and make it to be the refuge of the World; Keep me and my Children from the worship of Idols, they have seduced a part of the People; he that shall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me, and profess thy unity, shall be mine; if any one disobey me, thou art gracious and merciful: Lord, one part of my Lineage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiteth <hi>Mecca,</hi> in a place unfruitful, give them the grace to persevere in thy service, incline the hearts of Men to affect them, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich them with the Fruits of the Earth, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure they will thank thee; thou knowest whatsoever is in the World, I know it not; nothing that is in Heaven, or in Earth is hid from thee; praised be God, who hath given me <hi>Ismael</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi> in mine old age, he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth prayers when it pleaseth him; Lord, give me and my Posterity the grace to persevere in well doing, hear my prayers, pardon me, and pardon my Father, and all true believers at the Day of Judgment. Think not that God is ignorant of the actions of Infidels, he defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the punishment of their crimes until the day that all Men shall have their eyes opened: that day shall they behold their sins before their eyes, and their hearts shall be full of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation; If thou preachest to the people the Day of Judgment, hath God (will the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed say) preserved us to this present time, to do what thou dost appoint us? Say unto them,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:36900:142"/>
have ye not sworn heretofore, that there is no Resurrection? Ye have dwelt with the unjust, ye have seen how they have been chastised, and how we have spoken to you in Parables. Certainly they conspire, but God knoweth their conspiracy, their policy is to tempt the prophet, to see if he will make the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to move. Think not that God will vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate what he hath promised to the Prophets, he is Omnipotent, and avengeful. Consider the day wherein the Earth and Heavens shall change their face, and all people shall rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; that Day shall one sole God Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent command Men to come out of their Monuments; Thou shalt that day see the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bound in their Chains, their Garments shall be full of Pitch, and Guitran, their Faces shall be covered with Fire, that Day shall he recompence and chastise every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his works, he is exact to keep account; This Book was sent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the People, and teach them that there is but one God; the wise will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>

and sent Rain to water them; it is not you that caused the fruits thereof to spring forth; it is we who give life and death, and dispose of all things in the World. We know who they were that did precede you, and who they shall be that shall succeed you; I will assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble all at the end of the World to be judged; we created Man of the slime of the Earth, and before him the Devil, of fire, without smoak. Remember thou, that God said to his Angels, I will create Man of the slime of the Earth, I will breath upon him, to give him life; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate your selves before him; the Angels adored him, except the Devil; God said unto him, Wherefore dost thou not adore Man? He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, I will not adore him, thou hast crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me of fire, and him of the mire of the Earth: He said, get thee out of Paradise, thou shalt be banished, and accursed until the Day of Judgment. Lord, said the Devil, lay, not thy curse upon me until the Day of Judgment; he said, thou shalt be accursed until the Day nominated; Lord, said the Devil, I will tempt all the Creatures, because thou hast tempted me; I will cause them to disobey thy Commandments, except such as shall trust in thee, and recommend themselves to thy Divine Will. God said, this is the right way, thou hast no power over the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous who follow my Law, but only over the Infidels, for whom Hell is prepared. Hell hath seven Gates and every Gate hath its particular work; the righteous shall dwell in Gardens, adorned with fair Fountains, we will free them from all rancour; they shall repose upon Beds like Brethren, with respect, and affection, and shall be in eternal felicity. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:36900:144"/>
to them that worship me, that I am gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and merciful, and my chastisements are severe and rigorous. Preach unto them the History of the Guests of <hi>Abraham,</hi> they sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted him when they entred his House; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was terrified at their coming: they said to him, fear not us, we are the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of God; we declare to thee that thou shalt have a Son, who shall be a great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage: Do you tell me (said he) that I shall have a Son in my old age? why speak ye in that manner? We tell thee the truth, despair not of the grace of God, none but the wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair: O Messengers of God! (said <hi>Abraham</hi>) what do ye require? We are sent to destroy the Infidels, and to preserve the whole Family of <hi>Lot,</hi> except his Wife, she shall remain with them that shall be punished. When these Messengers came to <hi>Lot</hi>'s House, he told them, he knew them not; they said to him, we are come to thee, to clear this people of their doubt of God's Omnipotency; what we speak unto thee is most true; cause thy Family this night to go out of the City, and follow their steps, that none among you look behind him, and go whither you shall be commanded; the wicked shall in the morning be destroyed. The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the City came to <hi>Lot</hi>'s House to see those strangers; <hi>Lot</hi> said unto them, I beseech you defile not your selves, with my Guests, fear God, and dishonour not your selves, behold my Daughters, take them; They said, We do not hinder thee to lodge thy Guests, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained confounded in their drunkenness. In the morning Thunder surprised them, we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the City upside down, and caused it to rain Stones with Fire, that utterly destroyed it.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:36900:144"/>
This shall serve for example to Passengers that shall see those Ruines, and for a mark of the Omnipotency of God, to them that shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in his Divine Majesty. They that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited the Wood near to <hi>Medina</hi> were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, but we avenged us on them, they ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for example to posterity, as did the People of the City of <hi>Lot.</hi> They that dwell in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Hegir,</hi> have defamed the Prophets; we gave them to see our Miracles, and taught them our Commandments, they contemned them, but they reposed in the morning in their Houses built upon the Mountains, and in their Fortresses; when Thunder surprised them, their treasures did not save them, and they were all destroyed. We created the Heavens and the Earth to be signs of the Truth, and of our Unity: The hour of Judgment approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;<note place="margin">That is, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> containing seven Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> absent thy self from thy People with mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, thy Lord who created all things, knoweth all. We taught thee seven signs, and the most precious <hi>Alcoran.</hi> Tarry not to consider the divers sorts of riches which the wicked possess; afflict not thy self, if they persist in their impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Say unto them, I preach none other thing, but the Word of God, and the pains of Hell. We will chastise the wicked, as we chastised them that divided the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> who approved one part, and rejected the other. I am thy Lord, I will require of them an account of their actions, preach what hath been commanded thee, and depart from Infidels, we will preserve thee from them that shall scorn thee, as likewise from such as adore Idols; I know that thou wilt be grieved at their discourse, but praise and adore the Lord until Death.</p>

                  </note> The chastisement of God is not far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote; desire it not before its time; praised be God, he hath no Companion, he causeth the Angels to descend, and sendeth his inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to whom it pleaseth him; preach his power, and the pains of Hell to unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; there is no God but he, fear him, he created the Earth and the Heavens, he is more powerful than your Idols, and created Man of the Mire of the Earth, nevertheless he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate in his pride; he created clean Beasts for your use, you draw (from them) great emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument, and advantage, to cloth and nourish your selves, ye see their beauty when they feed; and when they lead them to pasture, they bear the burthen, and whatsoever ye will send into Cities, what ye cannot carry without them, but with exceeding great travel; God is gracious and merciful towards you; he created Horses, and Mules, and Asses to bear you; he cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated many glorious things, of which you have not knowledge. He teacheth them the right way,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:36900:145"/>
who observe his Commandments; had it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him, he had guided all into the way of his Law. He sendeth you water from Heaven to take away thirst, and causeth plants to bring forth, and Trees that nourish your flocks; he maketh the Olive Trees to produce, the Date Trees, Vines, and all sorts of Fruits. These things are Arguments of his Unity, to such as consider them; he created the Night, the Day, the Sun, the Moon and the Stars, that move at his Pleasure, these things are signs of his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency to them that are wise; He created whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is on Earth of divers Colours, kind, and Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; he created the Sea, which affordeth you Fish, Pearls, and other precious stones to adorn you; thou seest how the Ships sail upon the Waters, and divide the Waves for the advantage of Commerce, peradventure you will give God thanks for his Favours. He raised the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to make firm the Earth, and to hinder it to move, he created the Rivers, and established ways to guide you; he made the Stars to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct you by Night upon the Sea, and the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to direct you in your way by Day: who but he could have created what he hath made? will you never consider it? It is not in your power to keep account of his Mercies, he is altogether gracious and merciful, and knoweth the secret of your Souls: the Idols that ye adore can create nothing, but are things dead, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out motion, and know not in what time the World shall rise again; your God is one sole God; such as believe not the end of the World, such as deny his Unity, and boast of their false belief, are abhorred of his Divine Majesty; when they are interrogated concerning what God hath inspired into <hi>Mahomet;</hi> they answered,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:36900:146"/>
that he preacheth Fables of Antiquity, but they shall bear their Burthen at the Day of Judgment, who have seduced them from the right way, and have not known it. They that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them were deceivers, God overthrew their Habitations, the Ruins fell upon them, and he chastised them, when they least thought of it; he shall make them ashamed at the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and shall demand of them, where be the Idols for which they disputed against true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers? Such as have knowledge of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, assure that shame shall be upon the Foreheads of Infidels, and that the Angels shall cause them to die, because of the enormity of their sins; They will say at the hour of death, that they believe in God, and are penitent for their faults: God knoweth what they have done; he shall command them to enter into Hell, where is the abode of the proud: He shall command them who have his fear before their eyes to enter the house of Eternity, and the Gardens of <hi>Eden,</hi> wherein flow many Rivers, there shall they dwell eternally with the height of their desire. Shall the wicked continue in their sin, until the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels cause them to die, or until the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Thus did their Predecessours. God was not unjust towards them, they drew mischief on themselves through their iniquity; they were chastised and felt the punishment which they had despised; they have said, had it so pleased God, our Fathers and we had adored him alone; so spake their Predecessours. The Prophets are not obliged, but to preach and instruct the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. We sent a Prophet to every Nation, to instruct it, and to command the worship of one sole God, and to quit the Adoration of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,</hi> and of Idols; God guided some into the right
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:36900:146"/>
way, and others were seduced; consider what is the end of the wicked; if thou endeavourest to put them into the right path, thou shalt lose thy time, God guideth not them that desire to erre, they shall be deprived of Protection at the Day of Judgment: they have sworn by their Faith, that God will not make the dead to rise again, but he shall cause them to rise again, to chastise them according to his Promises; but the greatest part of Men do not know it, did they know it, they would acknowledge their Errours, and the impious would acknowledge their blasphemies. When we willed any thing, we said, be thou, and it was: They that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the wicked for the love of their Lord, and shall convert themselves, shall be rewarded in this World, and yet more in the other, had they knowledge to understand it. Such as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently endure the injuries of Unbelievers, and trust in their Lord, shall be recompenced when they least think of it. We heretofore sent but Men to preach our Law; ask of them that have knowledge of the written Law, if it be not true? We have sent to them the <hi>Alcoran;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi>
                  </note> to the end thou mayst instruct Men in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, peradventure they will consider it. The Earth shall produce nothing to them, that shall conspire against the Prophet, they shall be chastised when they least think of it; God shall afflict them in their commerce, they shall not escape his punishment, and their substance shall diminish by little and little before their eyes; God is gracious and merciful to them only that honour him: See they not the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of that which God hath created, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at the right hand, sometimes at the left, to adore his Divine Majesty, they certainly are
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:36900:147"/>
contemptible; whatsoever is on the Earth, and in the Heavens, Beast, and Angels, worship God with Humility, fear their Lord, and obey his Commandments. God hath commanded them to worship and to fear one God alone, to whom obedience is due eternally; whom will ye fear but God? who but God shall protect you? when evil befalleth you, you have recourse to his Divine goodness; being delivered, some of you give him thanks, and yet believe not in his Law: You seek only the riches of the Earth, but you shall see what shall be your end; they say, that their wealth proceedeth from their Idols: by God! an account of their blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies shall be required of them; they affirm that God hath Daughters; assuredly they deceive themselves, and are not well satisfied, when it is said to them, that a Daughter is born to them; they fly such as declare to them the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of their sins, God shall leave them in ignominy, and they shall be contemned as the Earth which they trample under their Feet; because they believe not in the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, misery shall perpetually pursue them; God shall command for ever, and be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally powerful and Victorious. Should God chastise Men when they offend, he should leave no living Creature upon the Earth, he defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth their punishment until the time appointed, they can neither advance nor retard it; they affirm God to have that which themselves are not satisfied to have; they lye, when they say that Paradise is for them, doubtless they are erroneous, and shall be precipitated into the fire of Hell. By God! we have sent hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Prophets to the people, the Devil seduced Men, and was Master of the wicked in this World,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:36900:147"/>
but in the other they shall resent great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: We have sent thee the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> to clear to Men the doubts touching Religion, and to guide true Believers into the right way. God sendeth rain from Heaven to refresh the Earth, this is an evident sign of his Omnipotency, to them that hear his word; ye have yet a token of his Omnipotency in the Beasts that give you Milk, to nourish you, and another mark in the Fruits of the Earth, in the Fruits of Date Trees, and the Vines, from which you extract Wine, and receive profit. These things are signs of his Omnipotency, to such as comprehend them. The Lord inspired the Bee to dwell in the Fields, to lodge in Trees, in Hives, and to eat of all sorts of Fruits, it produceth Honey of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers colours, that serveth for a remedy to the diseases of Men; these things are signs of Gods Omnipotency to them that consider them. God hath created you, and shall cause you to dye; There be Persons among you that shall be full of ignominy in their life, to the end they may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that God is Omnipotent, conferreth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits on some more than on others: Slaves have no part in the faculties of their Masters, neither are they associate with them, (nevertheless they associate to God another God equal to him, and blaspheme against his Grace.) God hath created you Men, and Women, and hath given you Children, and Children to your Children, he hath enriched you with the riches of the Earth; Will you after this Grace believe in your Idols, which are things inanimate, vain, and unprofitable? Will ye be ingrateful for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of God? Will ye worship what can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther benefit nor hurt you? Believe not that there is another God Companion and associate with
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:36900:148"/>
God? He knoweth what ye know not, he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you a Parable: A Slave that is poor cannot give Alms, and he who is rich giveth Alms se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly and publickly, as he seeth good; are they both alike? Ought they to be put in Parallel? Praise be to God: Certainly, the greatest part of Men know not his Graces, he teacheth you a Parable! Behold! two Men; the one was born deaf, and dumb, and given in charge to his Guardian, he knoweth not how to imploy him, he is capable neither of doing, nor speaking well, is he like to him that speaketh, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth, teacheth Men Justice, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the right way? Whatsoever is in Heaven, or on Earth appertaineth to God, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth any thing, it is performed in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an eye, yea sooner, he is Omnipotent: He it is that causeth you to come out of the Womb of your Mother, that giveth you hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, sight, and sense, perhaps ye will return him thanks; See ye not the Birds that fly in the Air; who sustaineth them but God? It is an evident sign of his Omnipotency for the true Believers, he hath given you Houses to inhabit, and the Skins and Furrs of Beasts to cover you, he hath given you their Hair, and Wooll, to furnish your Houses, and enrich you; he created Trees and Clouds to ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If the Unbelievers depart from the way of the Law, thou art obliged only to preach to them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibly; they know the Grace of God, and
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:36900:148"/>
contemn it, for that the greatest part of them are impious; preach unto them the Day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I will raise again all the Nations of the World, and the Prophets and Apostles who have prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to them my Commandments, there shall be no excuse for Infidels, neither shall they find protection, or relaxation of their Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: When they shall behold their Idols, they shall confess that they were mis-led, they shall understand the Unity of thy Lord, and that their Idols are not able to intercede for them. God hath added to the punishment of Infidels, hath sent them evil upon evil, because they hinder the World to follow his Law: Preach unto them the Day, wherein I will cause to rise again all the Nations of the World, with the Prophet who p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>hed to them, to be Witness of their Actions; I will be Witness against them of thy Nation; I have sent thee the Book that unfoldeth the Mysteries of my Law, to guide the people into the right way, and to declare the Joys of Paradise to such as profess my Unity. God commandeth you to do only that which is reasonable, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth you to give Alms, and to do good to your Parents, he forbiddeth Whoredom, disobedience, and injustice, enjoyneth you to do good, perhaps you will consider it. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what ye have Promised to God, break not promised Faith, ye call God to be Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of your Promises, he knoweth all your Actions. Do not like the Woman who spun a Thread, folded it, and afterwards entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and spoyled it, believe not that there is deceit and errour in your Law; If the Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers be more in number than you, God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth it, to prove you; he shall clear to
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:36900:149"/>
you at the Day of Judgment the doubts that be among you; had it so pleased him, you all had observed one and the same Law; he guideth, mis-leadeth whom it pleaseth him, and will exactly require of you an account of your Actions. Believe not that there is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in your Law, take heed of stumbling; having once confirmed your steps, ye shall be severely chastised, if ye seduce the people from the right way; do not violate what ye have promised to God, for any price, his Grace is of more advantage to you than the wealth of the Earth, had ye knowledge to understand it; your wealth is perishable, and the riches of Heaven are eternal; he shall recompence them that persevere in well-doing, and whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever shall do good works, shall be blessed in this World, and in the other. When thou shalt read the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> implore God to deliver thee from the Malice of the Devil, abominable to all the Creatures, he hath no power over them that trust in his Divine Majesty, his power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth over such as go astray, who obey not him, and adore many Gods. When we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any Precepts (God well knoweth what he ordaineth) they say thou art a Lyar, but the greatest part of them are ignorant; Say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that assuredly the Holy Ghost hath taught it from thy Lord, to confirm Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in their Faith, and to guide into the right way them that profess his Unity, and to announce to them the Joys of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise. I know, that they will say that a Man hath taught him the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> He whom they presume to have taught him, is a Persian by Nation, and speaketh the Language of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi> and the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is in the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:36900:149"/>
full of instruction and eloquence. They who will not believe in God, shall suffer great torments; such as renounce his Commandments, blaspheme against his Divine Majesty; those that reject his Law, after having professed it, shall feel the effect of his wrath, and be punished for preferring the wealth of the Earth to the riches of Heaven; God guideth not unbelievers. They in whose hearts he hath imprinted disobedience, those whom he hath deprived of hearing, and sight, are ignorant, they doubtless shall be at the end of the World in the number of the damned; he is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to them that convert, and repent to have mislead the People from the right way, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe in obedience to his Commandments. Be thou mindful of the day, wherein man shall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute against himself, and every one shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded according to his works without injustice. God teacheth you a Parable; behold a free and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged City, on the which God poureth his graces on all sides with abundance, and is ingrateful for his benefits; but he sent upon it misery, famine, and fear, because of its ingratitude. God hath sent to the Inhabitants thereof a Prophet of their Nation, they have standered him, and were chastised, because of their sin. Eat of what God hath given you, and give him thanks for his grace; if it be he whom ye worship, he forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you to eat of Carrion, of Bloud, and Swines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flesh, and whatsoever is not slain in pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Name of God; he will be gracious and merciful to them who shall eat through necessity, without design to offend him. Lie not, in saying, Behold that which is permitted to be eaten! blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme not against God; such as blaspheme against him, shall not prosper in this World, and in the other shall suffer grievous torments. We

did heretofore prohibit the <hi>Iews</hi> to eat of what we have recounted to thee; we did to them no injustice, they drew mischief on themselves through their sin; thy Lord is gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to them that ignorantly offend him, who convert, and do good works. <hi>Abraham</hi> was obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to God, and professed his unity, he ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Call the People to the Law of God with prudence, and preachings, and dispute against them with good arguments, God knoweth them that depart from the right way; if they evilly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, intreat them as they shall inteat you; if ye be patient, patience is advantagious to them that take it willingly, have patience for the love of God, and afflict not your selves with the deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and malice of the wicked.

               <p>IN the Name of God, gracious and merciful. Praise be to him, that caused his servant to go in one night from the Temple of <hi>Mecca,</hi> to the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> we have blessed that Temple, and whatsoever is about it, in token of our Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency. We gave to <hi>Moses</hi> the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to instruct the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> and to deter them from the worship of any other God, but of me; to forbid them to adore the Lineage of <hi>Noah,</hi> or the Lineage of them that we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in his Ark. <hi>Noah</hi> is my creature, and my<note place="margin">To quit their faith, and return to it often. <hi>See K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In the end, we gave you advantage over your Enemies; we gave you Wealth, and Children to succour you, and ye were more numerons than the Infidels; the good and the evil that you shall do, shall be for your souls.

Your Lord shall pardon you, if you convert; we have established Hell for a perpetual Prison of Infidels. The <hi>Alcoran</hi> guideth the Righteous into the right way, it declareth to them a great reward, preacheth to the wicked the torments of Hell; and exhorteth men to well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, although they are inclining to evil, and prompt to sin. We created the Day and the Night, they are two signs of our Omnipotency: We caused the Night to pass away, and the Day to appear for labour; and to the end ye might know the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Ages, of Months, and of Years: we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained our Mysteries without obscurity, and have enjoyned every one to bear the burden of his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at the Day of Judgment; that day will make men to see the account of their sins, they shall be recompenced and chastised according to the good and the evil that they shall have committed, and none shall bear the burden of his Neighbour: We sent to the People Prophets and Apostles to preach to them our Commandments, before they were chastised, before the destruction of a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: we advertised the Principal Inhabitants thereof; when they disobeyed us, we chastised them according to our word, and destroyed them.

Give to your parents what appertaineth to them, do good to the poor, and to pilgrims, be not prodigal, the prodigal are brethren of the Devil, ingrateful for the favours of their Lord. Contemn not the poor, if ye desire to obtain the mercy of God, speak to them with mildness, and endeavour to content them; do not entirely shut your hands, neither altogether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them; if ye do otherwise, ye shall offend.

we have commanded to pursue him that shall have slain his neighbour, but let not the heir sin maliciously, prosecuting the innocent for the guilty. The innocent is in Gods protection: take not the goods of Orphans, and be careful of them, until they be in years of discretion; satisfie your promises, an account shall be required of you; measure with good measure, and weigh with just weights. Busie your selves not with that which you ought not to know.

Be not proud, ye shall never be so long as the Earth, neither so high as the Mountains; such sins are exceeding great before thy Lord: It is one part of what he hath inspired into thee, to preach to his people: Say not, there be two Gods, lest thou be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the fire of Hell. Your Lord hath elected you, with all those men and women that obey his Commandments, for his sons and daughters, as the Angels; yet say not that God hath children.

When ye shall be called out of the graves by the Commandment of God, ye will believe that ye have remained but very little time in the world; then shall the Infidels confess, that the Devil hath deceived them, and that he is their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen enemy. Your Lord knoweth you all, he will pardon, or chastise you, as seemeth good to him: We have not sent thee to be their guardian; thy Lord knoweth whatsoever is in Heaven and in Earth.

Certainly, if thou tarry until the day of Judgment, I will destroy his race, except that small number that shall be under thy protection. Thy Lord said unto him, Get thee hence, hell shall be thy punishment, and the punishment of them that shall follow thee; deceive by thy speeches them whom thou shalt be able to deceive, seduce whom thou canst seduce with the wealth of the earth, cause them to exercise Usury, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the sin of whoredom; tell them, there is neither Resurrection nor Judgment; whatsoever thou shalt promise them shall be but vanity and falshood; thou shalt have no power over them that shall worship me, I will protect them against thee. It is your Lord, who causeth the ship to travel upon the waters, for the advantage of traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique; when the tempest chargeth you, your I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols forsake you, he alone is able to protect you, nevertheless when he hath caused you to arrive at the Port, you deny his Unity, and follow your impiety; believe ye that he will another time make the sea calm to you? and he will send you a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able wind, if ye do not acknowledg him your protector? Believe you to return again to the sea? He shall send you an impetuous wind, that shall overwhelm you, with your impiety,

and ye shall find none to protect you against him. We have conferred on men many favours, we have conducted them on the earth, and sea, enriched with all sorts of riches, and gratified them above all creatures of the earth; preach to them the day wherein I will assemble before me all the Nations of the World, with the Prophet that shall have preached to them. He to whom shall be given the Book of the Accompt of his works in his right hand, shall read his accompt entirely, no injustice shall be done to him, and he shall be happy. He that shall be blind in this world, shall be so in the other, and shall not see the right way. They would divert thee from performing what we have inspired into thee, to induce thee to blaspheme against me. If thou do it, thou shalt be of their friends; were it not for the strength that we have given thee, they would make thee to incline to their impiety; hadst thou done it, we had given thee to taste of great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions in this world, and in the other; thou hadst found none to protect thee against us; it wanted not much, but they had affrighted thee at <hi>Medina,</hi> to cause thee to go out of it; had they driven thee thence, they had not continued there long after thee.

They say, that thou art a man, and not an Angel: Say unto them, should the Angels have inhabited the earth, God would have sent an Angel to instruct them; it sufficeth, that he is the witness of mine actions between you and me, he knoweth and seeth all things; he whom God guideth, is well guided, and such as God shall cause to err, shall find none to put them into the right way; he will assemble all of them at the day of Judgment, they shall be infamous, deaf, mute, and blind, and condemned to the flames of hell, because they are wicked, and have said through derision, that they are bones, and flesh, and that they shall rise again as new creatures; see they not that God hath created heaven, and earth? that he can create yet more, and hath established a destiny indubitabe, and infallible?

               <p>IN the Name of God, gracious and merciful. Praise be to God, who hath sent the <hi>Alcoran</hi> to his servant. There is no contradiction in this Book; it teacheth the right way; it preacheth to the wicked, that they shall suffer great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and proclaimeth to the righteous, that they shall enjoy an eternal felicity; he preacheth the torments of Hell, principally to such as affirm, That God hath a Son; they are ignorant, like to their predecessors; they are ignorant in their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and utter nothing but blasphemies, Wilt thou destroy thy self in following their footsteps? If they believe not in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> they shall one day have sorrow, and shall repent it. We adorned the Earth, with whatsoever is upon it, for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of men. One part thereof is happy and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and the other unfruitful, and desart. Do ye not believe that the sleepers that entred the Cave, and the Paper wherein their names were written, be our miracles? When those men entred the Cave, they said, Lord, give us thy mercy,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:36900:156"/>
and guide us into the right way: Then did we cause them to sleep for the space of some years, and awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them, having continued some time in that Cave, to make it appear which of the two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions was the most just. I will relate to thee their History with truth; they were young men, who had the fear of their Lord before their eyes; we strengthned them, and encreased their faith; when they were with the Infidels, they said, Our God is Lord of heaven and Earth, we will never worship but one God, otherwise we shall separate our selves from the truth: This people have ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Idols without reason: who is more unjust than he, who blasphemeth against God? When they deserted the Infidels, they worshipped one God alone. Enter into the Cave, God shall make his mercy towards you to appear, and shall guide you through a path, smooth and pleasant. When the Sun arose, he cast his rayes on the right side of their Cave, and on the left, at his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down; they in the mean time were in the most spacious place of this Cave. This is one of Gods miracles; he whom he guideth, is well guided; and whom he misleadeth, shall find none to give him succor, or to guide him. Believe ye that they should be awake? Assuredly they slept and turned themselves, sometimes to one side, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to another: Consider how their Dog exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his feet before that old habitation of stone; if any one had entred towards them, he would have caused them to fly, and had affrighted them. In the end we awaked them, and they mutually enquired of each other in what place they were, and how long they had there continued; one of them reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That they had been there a day or two; then they all said, God knoweth the time that we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:36900:156"/>
here, send one of us to the City with money to buy bread and meat; let him not be fearful, neither make himself known to any; if we be known, they will murther or constrain us to follow their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in which we shall be eternally miserable. Thus did we stir up the people against them, to the end they might know that thy Lord is true; when he said, He will cause the dead to arise again, the Resurrection is indubitable; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless unbelievers dispute among them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the History of the Sleepers, and say, That they built a secret place to retire themselves. God knoweth the Truth. The True believers believe that they made no building; the Infidels say they were five, and that their dog was the sixth, they speak by opinion; but the True believers affirm them to be seven, and their dog to be the eighth. Say unto them, My Lord knoweth how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they were: few persons, except God, know their number: Doubt no more the History of the Sleepers, the matter is averred and known: dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute no more with the Jews, and say not, I will do this to morrow, without saying, If it plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:36900:157"/>
thou desirest to have content of life in this world: obey not those whose heart we have hardned, and are unmindful of us; follow not their impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; whatsoever they do, is but offence and sin. Say unto them, the truth proceedeth from your Lord; who shall desire [it] shall be True belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and who shall not desire [it] shall be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel, we have prepared Hell to chastise the impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and prisons wherein to detain them. They shall implore succors against the melting pit, into which they shall be plunged, as into waters, it shall rost their faces, and shall be their drink: I will not frustrate of reward them that shall have done well; they shall enjoy the delights of the gardens of <hi>Eden,</hi> wherein flow many rivers; they shall have bracelets of fine Gold; they shall be cloathed with green, with Scarlet, with shining colours, and shall sit on thrones, with an eternal felicity. Declare to them this parable: there were two men, I gave to the one of them gardens wherein are store of fruits, he in contempt told his companion, that he was more wealthy and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful than he, and entred into his gardens, being an Infidel, and an Idolater, and said, I do not think these shall ever have an end, they shall endure a long time without withering: His companion said to him: If thou dost not ackowledge this to proceed from God, and if thou be ingrateful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him that created thee of dust, and made thee a man, thou shalt soon find thy gardens ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: this cometh from God my Lord, who hath no companion: all strength and truth proceedeth from his divine Majesty: If I have less of substance than thou, God can give me fruits more fair than those of thy gardens, or send thunder that shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them, he shall fill them with water of rain, that shall encompass them, and hinder thee to approach
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:36900:157"/>
[them.] In the morning this Infidel found his gardens destroyed to the very roots; he was extreamly perplexed, by reason of the expence he had made to plant them evenly; and he said, Would to God I had not adored Idols: He shall find none that is able to protect him at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but God, all protection and grace issueth from his divine bounty, and the end of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous shall be happy. Speak unto them this parable, The life of the world is like unto rain fallen from Heaven, that refreshed and revived the herbs of the Earth, and in the morning were dry as chaff, carried away by the wind; God is omnipotent: Riches and Children are the ornaments of this life, but good works are eternal, they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, and give us hope of his grace. Be thou mindful of the day when the mountains shall walk, and thou shalt see the Earth to be plain; that day we assemble the good and the wicked, and will not fail of my word to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; that day shall the Infidels beseech the Lord to save them, he shall say unto them, You came unto us naked; as when we at first created you, and ye believed on Earth, that there was no resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Then shall he give to every one the Book, wherein shall be written the accompt of their sins; Thou shalt see the wicked trembling with fear, saying, behold here our destruction! What is there in this Book? It containeth their venial and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal sins, and detecteth their offences, they shall find the number of their crimes before their eyes: Thy Lord is unjust to none; Remember thou that we commanded the Angels to prostrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves before <hi>Adam,</hi> and that they humbled themselves, except the Devil, who was in the number of Angels, he disobeyed his Lord; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless <hi>Adam</hi> and his posterity have obeyed
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:36900:158"/>
him, although he is their open enemy, and particularly of the Infidels. Consider ye not that God created Heaven and Earth, and he made you, and hath no need to be aided of you? Be thou mindful of the day, when it shall be said to Idolaters, Call upon your Idols that ye have worshipped, for remission of your sins; they shall implore them, but none shall hear their prayers, we have ruined them; the wicked shall behold the fire, into which they shall fall, and find none to save them. We taught men in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> many parables, yet do the wicked abound in question, and dispute too much; What hindreth men to believe, since there is come to them a guide, to conduct them into the right way? If they beg not pardon of God, what hapned to their predecessors, and at <hi>Beder,</hi> shall befall them, they shall be visibly punished; I send Prophets only to anounce the joys of Paradise, and to preach the torments of Hell; the unbelievers dispute vainly, to obscure the truth, they deride my Commandments, and the fire of Hell; who is more unjust than he who knoweth the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of his Lord, and disobeyeth him, and forgetteth his past sins? We have hardned their hearts, they shall not understand the Scripture; we have stopped their ears, they shall hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; if thou callest them to the right way, they shall not follow thee, thy Lord is gracious and merciful; should he chastise them after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits, he should forthwith destroy them, he tarrieth until the time that he hath promised to punish them, and they shall find none of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to protect them. We have destroyed Cities, when their inhabitants have offended, and we prefixed the day of their ruine. Remember thou that <hi>Moses</hi> said to his servant, I will travel

incessantly, until I see a place where two seas meet, although I travel an Age. When he came to that place, he and his servant forgot their fish, he had taken his way through the Sea: Having conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued their voyage some time, <hi>Moses</hi> was an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and demanded somewhat to eat of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, who said to him, Sawest thou what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the Rock?

They went together, and they being in a boat, he brake a plank; <hi>Moses</hi> said to him, Thou hast broken this vessel, to drown us, it is a strange thing; He answered, Did not I tell thee, that thou wilt not be able patiently to abide with me? <hi>Moses</hi> replied, Excuse me, and afflict me not, I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten what thou didst enjoyn me? They went on together until they met with a child, whom he slew; <hi>Moses</hi> said to him, Thou hast slain an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, that hath not slain any one; thou hast done a thing without reason, and that ought not to be approved: He answered, Did I not say, thou wilt not be able patiently to abide with me? <hi>Moses</hi> said to him, Excuse me this time also, if I demand ought

They continued their way unto a Village, where the inhabitants refused them bread; at that time they found a wall ruined, which he raised again; <hi>Moses</hi> said to him, Thou shouldst have been payed for repairing this wall, if thou wouldst: He answered, Now behold the place of our separation, nevertheless I will explain to thee what thou wert impatient to learn. That boat belongeth to two poor men, who labour on the sea to gain their subsistence, I would have pierced it, to preserve it to those poor men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there was an Infidel Prince, who by force seized on the good vessels for his service. That In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant which I slew was an Idolater, the son of a true believer, a righteous man; we feared he might cause his father to sin, and seduce him into his error, and infidelity; the Lord through his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness would have him to be destroyed, to deliver his father from his malice. The wall appertaineth to two infant Orphans of this City, there is under it a treasure that belongeth to them, their father was a righteous man, God through his goodness wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth that the treasure be preserved for them, until they attain to years of Discretioni; he likewise wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me to do what I have done: behold the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of what thou wert impatient to learn.

this, he continued his way until he came to a place, where the Sun riseth; he found that it riseth in a Countrey, where they have nothing to shelter them from its heat, the thing is so: we taught <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> how to shelter himself; he followed his way, until he arrived between two Mountains, inhabited of a Nation that spake a Language which he could hardly understand; they said to him, O <hi>Alexander! Iagog,</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> defile the Earth, canst thou put between them and us an obstacle, to hinder that they may not come to us? God, said <hi>Alexander,</hi> hath not given me means to do it; but assist me with your power, I will put between them and you a strong separation; give me Iron that can cut Stones, that I may build betwixt the two Mountains, and that I may fortifie the way that divideth them; blow when the Iron striketh the Stones, to kindle fire, and pour on molten Brass to joyn the Stones and Iron together; if they come, they cannot pierce through the Mountains, neither find a way to come to you, this is a favour which God conferreth on you, his promises are infallible; when the hour arriveth, he is true in what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth; we will permit them to mix each with others; we will assemble all of them when the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet shall sound; then we will open Hell to the wicked, and to such as would neither see, nor hear the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> Do they imagin them that worship me to be their gods? We have prepared Hell to punish them. Say unto them, shall I relate unto thee what shall befal the damned? Their works shall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable in this World, although they think to do well, good works are unprofitable to them that contemn the Commandments of their Lord, and believe not in the Resurrection; they shall not want ballance at the Day of Judgment; Hell shall be their habitation, because they deride our

Commandments, and our Apostles, and Prophets: The Righteous shall enjoy eternally the delight of Paradise without discontinuation. If the Sea were Ink, to write the wondrous works of my Lord, it will sooner have an end than his Miracles: Say unto the Infidels, I am a man like you, God hath taught me that there is but one God; he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in the Resurrection, studieth to do good works; worship but one God, who is without a companion.</p>

It was answered him, the thing shall be as I have said unto thee, it is easie to thy Lord, who created thee; he said, Lord give me some sign of the Conception of my Wife; he said to him, Thou shalt not speak for Three nights.

Wherefore am I not in the number of persons for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten?

Remember thou what is written of <hi>Moses,</hi> he was a Righteous man, our Prophet and Messenger; we called him on the right side of the Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> drew him near unto us, and taught him our secrets; we through special grace gave him a Brother, named <hi>Aaron.</hi> Remember thou what is written of <hi>Ismael,</hi> he exactly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served what he promised, was a Prophet, and an Apostle of the Lord, preached Purity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to men to make their prayers often, and was pleasing to his Lord.

               </argument>
               <p>IN the name of God gracious and merciful. We have not given thee the <hi>Alcoran</hi> to torment thee, but to instruct therein the righteous. It was sent thee by him that created the Heavens and the Earth; the merciful sitteth on his Throne; whatsoever is in Heaven and Earth, whatsoever is between them and beneath the Earth, apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to him. He knoweth thy thoughts, he understandeth what thou keepest secret, and what thou makest manifest. God! there is but one God, all the glorious names of the world are due unto him. Knowest thou the History of <hi>Moses?</hi> When he beheld the fire, he said to his family, Stay ye here, I see a great fire, I will bring to you a spark,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:36900:164"/>
and you shall find in it the right way. When he approached, it was said unto him, O <hi>Moses!</hi> I am thy Lord, put off thy shooes, thou art in the holy Valley of <hi>Toi,</hi> I have elected thee among my people, hear my word, and receive mine inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; I am God, there is none other God but I; worship me alone, and make thy prayers as it is ordained; The hour unknown to the world ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth, wherein I will recompence and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise every one after his works: Take heed lest the wicked seduce thee from the right way; if thou follow their appetite, thou shalt be destroyed; Is it not what thou hast sworn to me? he answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Lord, I will apply my self unto thee, and will lean upon my staff; I will beat the fruits of the Trees to make them fall upon my flocks; I have yet another manner to nourish my sheep with this staff; I will make use of it to defend, and preserve them from mischief? God said unto him, O <hi>Moses!</hi> cast that staff to the ground, behold a Serpent, it creepeth, take it, and be not afraid, I will cause it to return to its former condition; draw back thine hand, and put it under thy arm, it shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come white and shining, without harm, and pain, it shall be a most certain sign of my Unity, I will give thee to see the miracles of my Omnipotency; Go to <hi>Pharoab,</hi> he is in an exceeding great error, and seduced from the right way: <hi>Moses</hi> said, Lord, rejoyce my heart, and facilitate my commission, unloose the knot of my tongue, that they may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand my speech: give me <hi>Aaron</hi> to assist me in this business, that I may praise thee, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exalt thy glory, thou only art our protector. God said, Thy prayer is heard, we were favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to thee another time, when we inspired thy mother to put thee into a coffer, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:36900:164"/>
thee to the river of <hi>Nile;</hi> the water drove thee to the shore, whence <hi>Pharoah</hi> took thee; I caused thee to be beloved of him, to have care of my people; when thy sister sought tidings of what was become of thee, she said, Who will guide us where he is? who will conduct us to him that keepeth him? we sent thee back to thy mother, to stop her tears, and put an end to her affliction. Thou slewest a man, we have deliver'd thee from the hands of thine enemies, and have approved thy perseverance; thou hast continued some time with the inhabitants of <hi>Madian;</hi> after this we sent thee to preach our Commandments; I have made choice of thee, go with thy brother to <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and lie not in speaking of me, he is gone astray from the right way; speak to him both of you, with mildness, peradventure he will hearken to you, and will fear the fire of hell; they answered, Lord, We fear that he may torment, and rise up against us: he said, Fear nothing, I will be with you, hear what he will say, consider his actions; address your selves to him, and say, We are the Messengers of the Omnipotent God; dismiss with us the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Israel,</hi> and no more torment them, we are come hither by the Commandment of God, thy Lord. Salvation is for such as follow the right way, damnation for them that blaspheme against his Law, and depart from his Commandments; <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi> said unto them, Who is your God? <hi>Moses</hi> said, My God is he that created the world, and guideth men into the right way. <hi>Pharoah</hi> said, what law did your predecessors observe? what is become of them? <hi>Moses</hi> answered, God knoweth in what condition they are; nothing is concealed from God, he extended the earth, and established the ways; he causeth rain to descend from heaven, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:36900:165"/>
to spring forth the plants, herbs, and fruits which ye eat, and that nourish your flocks. These things are signs of his Omnipotency to them that understand them. We created you of earth, and to earth will we make you to return, and will cause you to come out of it once again; we shewed miracles to <hi>Pharoah,</hi> but he was incredulous, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned them, and said, O <hi>Moses!</hi> Art thou come to drive us out of our Dominions with thy Magick? I will shew thee [Magick] like to thine; let us meet at a place and day prefixed between thee and me, to come together; <hi>Moses</hi> said unto him, Let us make choice of the day of your feast; if it seem good to you the people may assemble at the Sun ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing: After this discourse, <hi>Pharoab</hi> withdrew, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected all his subtilties, and at the day and hour prefixed, came with his people to the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, where <hi>Moses</hi> was, who said unto them, Misery is upon you, blaspeme not against God, he will punish you, and destroy them that blaspheme against him; The people of <hi>Pharoah</hi> differed in opinion what they should do, kept their design se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and said to <hi>Pharoah,</hi> These two men are Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians, they would chase you from your Country, through their Magick, and seduce your subjects from your Religion; recollect your subtilties and power, and chuse persons capable to dispute against them, this day shall be happy to him that shall be victorious. They said to <hi>Moses,</hi> Wilt thou first cast thy staff on the ground, or shall we ours? Their cords and staves arose against <hi>Moses</hi> through their Magick, and crawled: <hi>Moses</hi> spake low, between his teeth; we said unto him, Fear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, thou shalt be victorious, cast thy staff in thy right hand on the ground, it shall devour what they have done, it is but witchcraft and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:36900:165"/>
that produceth neither Profit nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Then fell the Magicians of <hi>Pharoah</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate on the ground, and said, We believe in the God of <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Moses; Pharoah</hi> said unto them, believe ye in him without my permission? <hi>Moses</hi> is your master, I will cut off your right feet, and your left hands; or your left feet, and your right hands, and cause you to be hanged on Palm-trees, that ye may know who is the more severe in his chastisements, I, or the God of <hi>Moses;</hi> they said, the miracles that thou hast seen, have they not touched thee? He that created us, doth things which are not in thy power to perform; thy power extendeth only in this World, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God our Lord, who will pardon our sins; thou art the cause that he abhorreth us with our magick, he is more powerful than thou, and Eternal; Hell is prepared for Infidels, they shall find repose neither in their life nor death; and the righteous that shall do good works, shall eternally enjoy the pleasures of the gardens of <hi>Eden,</hi> wherein flow many delicious Rivers, such is the reward of them that are purged from their sins. We said unto <hi>Moses,</hi> Go out by Night with my People, and make them a drie Path through the Sea, fear not that thine Enemies may overtake thee, neither be afraid of being drowned, <hi>Pharoah</hi> shall follow them with his Troops; I will overwhelm in the Sea, and will mislead him with his People, he shall not follow the right way. O Children of <hi>Israel!</hi> We delivered you from your Enemies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted you towards the mountains of <hi>Sinai:</hi> We caused Manna and Quailes to descend upon you, and said, Eat ye of the good things that we have given you, and be not ungrateful, otherwise my wrath shall fall upon you; he upon whom mine indignation shall fall, shall be thrown headlong
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:36900:166"/>
into the Fire of Hell; I will be merciful to such as shall convert, do good works, and follow the right way. O <hi>Moses!</hi> who pressed thee to absent thy self from thy People? He answered, behold he that followeth my steps, I am come up to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thy Commandments. We after thy depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture estranged thy People from thee, and <hi>Samery</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them from the right way; he returned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his steps to his People, in great displeasure, and said, O ye People! did not God promise to you all manner of content? He protracted the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his promises, because of your sins, will you that his wrath fall upon you? Wherefore have ye trangressed what ye promised to me? They said, we have not transgressed our promises of our own accord; we took the most weighty ornaments of the People, and cast them into the Fire, <hi>Samery</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self did cast them in; he made the body of a bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Calf, and said, with his followers, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold there your God, the God of <hi>Moses</hi> whom he hath forgotten; Saw they not that this Calf spake not to them, and that it had not power to do good or evil? <hi>Aaron</hi> had said unto them, before the coming of <hi>Moses;</hi> O ye People! you have been seduced by this Calf; the merciful is your God, and your Lord, Follow and obey me: They said, Shall we abide here until <hi>Moses</hi> return? <hi>Moses</hi> at his return said unto <hi>Aaron,</hi> What hindred thee to follow me, when thou sawest them to turn aside from the Law of God? Wherefore hast thou disobeyed me? O Son of my Mother! (said <hi>Aaron</hi>) drag me not by the Beard and Hair, I feared to displease thee, if I forsook the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> and disobey thy Commandments; <hi>Moses</hi> said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Samery,</hi> what was thy design? He answered, I saw what this People seeth not, I took an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the Earth of the footsteps of the Messenger
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:36900:166"/>
of God, and made the Figure of a Calf, the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest that I could; <hi>Moses</hi> said unto him, Go, get thee from among us, thou shalt fly the presence of men all the days of thy life; thou shalt say unto them, Come not nigh me, touch me not, the time of thy punishment is appointed, thou shalt not escape it; behold thy false god, behold the Calf which thou hast adored, I will cause it to burn, and will cast the ashes thereof into the Sea; your God is one God, and there is none other God, but the God that knoweth all things: Thus do I relate to thee things past; we have sent thee the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> such as shall abjure it, shall bear their burthen at the Day of Judgment, and be eternally tormented; I will one day require an account of their burden, and will assemble them with all their subtilties; when the Trumpet shall sound, they shall demand of each other, how long they have continued in the World? They shall say, That they have remained there but Ten days and Ten nights, I know all that they will say; the most prudent among them shall say, that they have been but one day. They shall enquire of thee concerning the Mountains; Say unto them, God shall tear them up, and level them with the Earth, thou shalt see them levelled and beaten down: Then shall men without retardment fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him that shall summon them to universal Judgment, they shall humble themselves before God, thou shalt that Day hear low and humble voices, that day shall prayers be ineffectual except of them that shall be pleasing to God, whom he will permit to speak. He knoweth whatsoever men do in this World, and what must befull them in the other, and they know it not, they shall humble themselves, and hang down the Head before the Living and Eternal Lord; all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:36900:167"/>
shall be damned, and the Righteous of True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers that have done good works, shall not fear injustice. We have sent the <hi>Alcoran</hi> in the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bique</hi> Tongue, it teacheth men our Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, peradventure they will fear impiety; it teacheth them what they ought to know; Exalt the glory of God, King of the World, he is truth it self; press not thy self to read the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> until thou hast well understood it. Say, Lord encrease my knowledge; We heretofore prohibited <hi>Adam</hi> to eat of the forbidden fruit, he was unmindful of our Commandment, I found in him no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance. Remember thou that we commanded the Angels to humble themselves before him, they humbled themselves, except the Devil, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to do it. Remember that we said, <hi>Adam,</hi> the Devil is thine enemy, and the enemy of thy Wife, he will endeavour to make you miserable, to cause you both to go out of Paradise, where thou sufferest neither hunger nor thirst, nor cold, nor heat; the Devil tempted them, and said, oh <hi>Adam!</hi> I will conduct thee to the Tree of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a treasure that shall never perish; they did both eat of the fruit of that Tree, then knew they their filthiness, and took the leaves of Trees to cover their nakedness; <hi>Adam</hi> disobeyed his Lord, and became miserable, nevertheless he heard, and pardoned him, and shewed him the right; he said, descend from Paradice, ye Enemies of each other, I will hereafter send you a guide, he that shall follow him, shall not err, and shall be blessed; he that shall go astray, and will not believe in me, shall be miserable in the World, and blind at the Day of Judgment; that Day shall he say, Lord, wherefore hast thou made me blind? I had good sight when I was in the World: I did this day forget thee,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:36900:167"/>
as thou didst forget my Commandments; thus do I intreat Infidels. The torments of the other World are more grievous than those of the Earth, and of longer continuance; do not unbelievers tremble, when they consider how many men upon Earth we have destroyed in past Ages? Their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery shall serve for example to them that are wise; had not thy Lord said, that he will defer the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of the wicked until the time appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he had already destroyed them. Be pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and endure their Discourse, praise thy Lord before the Sun arise, before it setteth, an hour before Night, and at the end of Day thou shalt do a thing acceptable to him: The life of the World is sweet to tempt you, but the Riches of thy Lord are better, and Eternal. Command the People to make their prayers at the time appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and be not impatient towards them; I require no Riches of thee, I will enrich thee, and in the end Paradise shall be for the Righteous. The unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have said, if <hi>Mahomet</hi> sheweth not some Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle from God, and knoweth not the exposition of the Books of our Predecessors, we will not believe in him; we before his coming destroyed many wicked persons, who said, Lord, hadst thou sent us a Prophet, we had observed thy Commandments, before we became infamous, and laden with ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy; Say unto them, every one expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his end; expect ye, and ye shall one day know them that follow the right way, and have not erred.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> The Chapter of the Prophets, containing an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Twelve Verses, written at <hi>Mecca.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN the Name of God, Gracious and merciful. The Day approacheth wherein the People shall render an account of their actions, but they consider it not, and depart from the Commandments of God; if they hear them, they laugh, they understand them not, and keep secret their evil intentions. Is not <hi>Mahomet</hi> a man like to you? Will ye say that he is a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician? You see the contrary; God heareth whatsoever is spoken, both in Heaven and Earth, and knoweth all things. They say, certainly <hi>Mahomet</hi> hath dreamed what he speaketh, he hath invented it, and is a Poet, we will not believe him, unless he shew some Miracle, as did the Prophets that were before him. We have layed waste many Cities, because their inhabitants were incredulous; we sent before thee but men who were inspired of us; Enquire of them, to whom heretofore was given the knowledge of the written Law, if ye know it not; they were men that did eat and drink, and were mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; we effected what we promised to them, we preserved them with such as believed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed the incredulous; we have sent you a Book to instruct you, will ye understand it? How many Infidel Cities have we made desolate? How many new People have we established in their place? When they felt our punishment, they fled; fly not, and return to what hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted you, return into your houses, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure ye will yet covet the Riches of the Earth; they said, Misery is upon us, we are
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:36900:168"/>
too blame; thus did they talk, until they were destroyed. We have not created Heaven and Earth, and whatsoever is between them, to sport with; had it been our will that they should have scoffed on Earth, they should scoff likewise in Heaven. On the contrary, I oppose the truth to falsehood, to confound it, and in effect it doth confound it. Misery shall be upon you, because of your blasphemies; whatsoever is in Heaven and Earth, is Gods; the Angels are not ashamed to worship him, they praise him Day and Night, and exalt his glory without blasphemy. The Infidels worship Gods made of Earth; have they power to create any thing? Were there in Heaven, and on Earth another God, they would not accord; praised be God, Lord of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, what the Infidels relate, is untrue. He asketh no counsel when he will do any thing, as do men; will they worship any other God but him? Say unto them, produce your arguments, behold what we have to speak unto you, behold our reasons, and those of our predecessors; Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, the greatest part of them are ignorant of the Truth, and go astray. We inspired into all the Prophets which we sent, that there was but one God that ought to be worshipped. They said, believe ye that the Angels are the Sons of God? Praised be God; on the contrary, they are his Creatures, he loveth them, they speak not but after him, and obey what he commandeth them, he knoweth all their actions past, and future; they pray for no man but through his permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and fear to displease him. Who among them will say I am God, instead of God? He shall be cast headlong into the Fire of Hell; thus do I intreat unbelievers. Know they not that the Heavens and the Earth was shut up?
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:36900:169"/>
VVe opened them, and gave life to every thing, through the Rain which we made to descend; will they not believe in my unity? VVe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Mountains to hinder the Earth to move, we made therein ways large and spacious for our Creatures, we covered it with the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and have exempted it from falling, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless they depise our Commandments. It is the Lord who created Day and Night, the Moon and the Sun, all things praise and exalt him in Heaven; we created no Person to dwell for ever on Earth; all men shall taste of Death, I will prove you with good and evil, and ye shall appear before me to give account of your actions: The Infidels scoff at you, when they see you, and say, behold them that deride our gods! They obey not the Commandments of God; he created man of dust, and shall shew you the effects of his Omnipotency; be not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to see the punishment of the wicked, who say, when shall be the Day of Judgment? Did they know it, they would remove the Fire from their backs and visages; that Day shall surprize them, it shall astonish them when they think least of it; they cannot retard it, and shall be deprived of protection. Certainly, they scorned the Prophets that were sent before thee, but they were punished after their deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Say unto them, who but the merciful [God] preserveth you Day and Night? Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless ye reject his Commandments; Have they any other God but me, that is able to save them? Their gods cannot defend themselves: I will not protect them, yet will I enrich them, as I enriched their fathers, and will prolong their life, to punish them on Earth; Know they not that their estates diminish on all
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:36900:169"/>
sides through thy Conquests? Is it so, that they are victorious? Say unto them, I preach to you what God hath inspired into me, but the deaf hear not when they are exhorted; VVhen they are a little touched with the chastisements of God, they say, oh misery! We are too blame, and are unjust; I will weigh their works at the Day of Judgment, that I may do injustice to no person, of the weight of a grain of Mustard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seed, and will most exactly account. We gave to <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> the Book that distinguisheth good from evil, and commanded them to preach our Commandments to them that had our fear before their eyes. That Book is blessed, and was sent from us; nevertheless, unbelievers reject and condemn it. We heretofore instructed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> in the right way, and knew that he was a Righteous man. Remember thou that he said to his Father, and his People, What Idols do ye adore? They said, We find that our Fathers adored them; he said unto them, your Fathers and you were exceedingly erroneous: They said, Dost thou speak the truth, or dost thou jest? He said, Certainly your Lord is the Lord of Heaven and Earth, I swear to you that he created them; Having convinced those Idolaters, he said, By God, I will make war upon your Idols, he broke them with an Hatchet in their absence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> except the greatest Idol, on which he hung his Hatchet, and said, Peraventure they will accuse him to have broken the other: Seeing at their return their Idols broken, they said, who hath in this manner handled our gods? He is impious; we heard it is a young man, named <hi>Abraham,</hi> who derideth them, bring him before the eyes of the People, perhaps they shall find witnesses of his action. They said unto him, Oh <hi>Abraham!</hi> It is
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:36900:170"/>
thou that hast so abused our gods; he said on the contrary, it is that great Idol; they enquired of each other if those Idols spake, and if they had motion; afterwards they returned to themselves, and said to the People, Ye are too blame to adore those Idols; he threw them headlong against the ground, and they said, Oh <hi>Abraham!</hi> Thou well knewest that they spake not at all; he answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Why therefore do ye worship what can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther benefit nor hurt you? You defile your selves in adoring them instead of God, Do ye not know him? Then they said, Burn <hi>Abraham,</hi> and let us defend our Gods, if ye are Righteous men; but we commanded the Fire to lose its heat, to preserve <hi>Abraham;</hi> they would have tormented him, and we destroyed them; we saved him, as we preserved <hi>Lot;</hi> we conducted him into the Land of Blessing, gave him <hi>Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and the Children of their Children, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, and True believers, to instruct the People in the way of Salvation; we inspired them to do good works, to pray at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, to pay Tithes, and to worship us; we gave to <hi>Lot</hi> prudence and knowledge, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him from the Inhabitants of the City, who were the most vicious upon Earth; we were gracious to him, because he was Righteous. Remember <hi>Noah,</hi> and that he heretofore invoked us; we heard his Prayer, and delivered him from great danger, and all that were with him in the Ark; we delivered him from the hand of the wicked, whom we drowned. Remember <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> who rendred Justice in the Field, whereinto the Flocks of the Village en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by Night without Shepherds; we are witness of their Judgments, we instructed <hi>Solomon</hi> in Justice, we gave him Prudence and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:36900:170"/>
Knowledg; the Mountains adored us with <hi>David,</hi> and with him the Birds praised us; we were with them when they praised us. We taught you the manner of sowing [Seed] to preserve you from necessity; peradventure ye will be thankful to me. We commanded the Winds to obey <hi>Solomon,</hi> and know all that he did. The Devils obeyd him, they dived into the Sea, to fish for Gems for him, and travelled also in other matters; and we hindred them to act mischief against men. Remember <hi>Iob,</hi> who prayed to his Lord, and said, I am in exceeding great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; thou art the merciful of the merciful: We heard him, and delivered him from his affliction; gave to him our grace, and to his family, and to them that were with him, who had patience, and trusted in me. Remember <hi>Ismael, Enoch,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Delcafel</hi> is <hi>Ely.</hi> See the Book composed by <hi>Abdel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baky.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cafel,</hi> and <hi>Zachary,</hi> they persevered in well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; we gave them our grace, because they were Righteous. Remember <hi>Ionas,</hi> who forsook his People in displeasure; he believed I could do nothing against him; but he cryed in the dark, and said, There is no God besides thee, praised be thy Name; I am to blame for having offended thee. We heard him, and delivered him from his disaster. Thus do I protect True believers, when they invoke me. Remember <hi>Zachary,</hi> who made his Prayer, and said, Lord, I know there is no better Heir in the World than thy self; yet let me not dye without issue: We heard his request, gave him a Son, named <hi>Iohn,</hi> and rendred his Wife fruitful. All these Prophets went on with ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity to do well, and invoked us with humility, with desire to obtain our grace, and with fear of the torments of Hell. Remember <hi>Mary,</hi> whose womb I blessed; we inspired into her our Spirit, and gave her a Son, a Miracle in the VVorld.

Your Law is one onely Law, and I am one onely God, worship me, and be not impious; ye all shall appear before me to be judged. I will protect the True believers that shall have done good works, and will write what they shall do for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Misery is upon the Cities that we have ruined; their inhabitants shall not return into the World, until the passage be opened to <hi>Iagog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and they come running from the eminent places of the Earth; then shall the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment approach; the promised Truth shall not be far off, it shall trouble the sight of the wicked, who shall say, O misery! We are miserable, we did not foresee this disaster, we have been exceeding too blame for having offended God. It shall be said unto them, Ye worshipped instead of God, the firebrands of Hell, into which ye shall be cast head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long: Had your Idols been Gods, as ye believed, they should not have entred Hell; they, and those that have adored them, shall be eternally damned; they shall groan, complain, and shall not be heard: Such as shall be in Paradise, shall be far remote from them; they shall not hear their howlings, and shall enjoy eternally what they shall desire; the crys of the Damned shall not afflict them; the Angels shall meet them when they come out of their graves; and shall say, Behold now the day that was foretold you in the World; a Day wherein we will open the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and the Book of the account of all men, as we promised to your predecessors. We ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly perform what we promise; we have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Old Testament, and afterwards in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> That the Righteous shall inherit the Earth: This Book shall teach the way of Paradise to them that shall worship me: We had not sent thee, but in favour of men; say unto
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:36900:172"/>
them, God hath always inspired into me, that your God is one God, will ye not obey him? If they go astray, I have taught you how they must be intreated. Say unto them, I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the punishment denounced to you shall be speedy, or tardy. God knoweth what is known, and unknown in the World; I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will try you, or defer his punishment until the time appointed: He is a most just Judg, and most merciful; he is not such as ye speak him.</p>

               <p>IN the Name of God, Gracious and Merciful. O ye People! fear God. The Earthquake that shall happen at the Day of Judgment shall be wonderful; ye shall that day see Mothers forget their Children, and every one shall bear his own burden; ye shall see men drunk, not with Wine, but amazed and astonished at the great judgments of God. There be, who dispute of the Deity with ignorance, and follow the will of the Devil, voluntary, and obstinate: It is written, he shall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them that obey him, and shall conduct them into Hell. O ye People! if ye doubt of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, consider how we created you of the dust of the Earth; with a little Water sprinkled upon the Dust of the Earth; with congealed blood, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle flesh intirely, and not intirely formed. I form

in the wombs of Women, what seemeth good to me at the time appointed; I cause you to come forth Children, then I give you life, and make you to arrive to the Age of Virility; some die young, and others live to extremiry of Age, to the end they may learn to live well. Consider the Earth, dry, dead, and barren; when we shall cause Rain to fall, it shall change the face, shall produce and nourish its fruits of all sorts, fair, and pleasing: Because God is truth it self, he raiseth again the dead, and is Omnipotent. There is no doubt but the Day of Judgment approacheth, and that God will cause the dead to rise again. There be men that dispute of God without knowledg, without reason, without authority, and go astray from the way of his Law; they shall be full of ignominy and shame in this World, and shall feel in the other, the pains of Hell. God doth no injustice to his People. There be who who adore him with scruple; if good befal them, they persevere to adore him; if evil, they return to their impiety, and lose the riches of Earth, and the riches of Heaven: These two losses are exceeding great; they invoke Idols instead of God; they invoke what can neither benefit, nor hurt them: Such prayers are by-ways, far remote from the Commandments of God; they worship that which doth rather mischief, nor advantage them. Certainly, God shall make the True-believers, that do good works, to enter into Gardens, wherein flow many Rivers; he doth what seemeth good to him.

Seest thou not that all that is in Heaven, and on Earth, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the Mountains, Trees, and Beasts, adore him? Many worship him with zeal, but many likewise merit to be punished: None shall esteem him, whom God shall despise; he doth as seemeth good to him. These two contrary parties, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers and the Infidels, have disputed of the Deity; but the Infidels shall be encompassed with flames of Hell, they shall have Shirts of Fire, boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Water shall flow in upon their Heads; the Fire shall burn what is in their Bellies, and shall roast their Skin, they shall be beaten with Clubs of Iron; when they think to go out of this Fire, they shall enter further into it, and be eternally tormented. God shall cause the True-believers, that have done good works, to go into Gardens, wherein flow many Rivers; they shall be adorned with Bracelets of Gold, and Pearls; they shall be clothed with Silk, and enjoy Eternal felicity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have professed his Unity; and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels shall suffer great torments, for that they have hindred the People to imbrace the Faith, and visit the Temple of <hi>Mecca,</hi> which God hath established to be therein adored of all the World: He that shall be sollicited to visit it, and shall enter it, with design to return to his impiety, shall be severely punished. Remember, that we shewed to <hi>Abraham</hi> the place to build the Temple of <hi>Mecca;</hi> that we commanded him to adore me alone, and to purge my Temple from Idols, for the satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them that should there make processions.

Men shall come thither to visit thee from all parts, on foot, and on Horse-back; they shall receive profit, they shall there make their prayers at the times appointed, and the days nominated; they shall thank the Lord for his benefits towards them, and the Riches which he hath given them; and shall make likewise processions at the old Temple. He that shall reverence it, shall do exceeding well, and shall be recompenced of his Lord. It is lawful for you to eat of all clean Beasts, except of such as have been heretofore prohibited: Depart from the pollution of Idols; beware of bearing false wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and be obedient to God. He that saith, God hath a Companion, is like to him that fell head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long from Heaven, whom the Birds devoured, and the wind cast into a remote place, full of miseries. He that shall reverence the signs of the power of God, will not doubt of his Law, and shall be rewarded for his good works at the time appointed, if he visit the old Temple of <hi>Mecca.</hi> We have given to all Nations of the World a Law to offer their Sacrifices, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thanks to their Lord, for having given them advantage above all sorts of Beasts. Your God is one God, obey his Commandments, proclaim a great reward to them that are obedient to him, to them that tremble with fear, when they hear mention of his name; that are patient in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, that pray at the time appointed, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in alms some part of the wealth that we have given them.

When they were driven from their houses without reason; they said, God is our Lord; Had not God stirred up the people against each other, the Covents of the Religious, the Churches of the Christians, the Synagogues of the Jews, and the Temples of the Believers, had been ruined, (through the multitude of<note place="margin">See <hi>Gelal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din.</hi>

God is most strong; he hath all power over his people. Those whom God hath established on Earth, with victory over their enemies, make their prayers in the manner ordained; pay Tithes, and enjoin to do what is honest and civil; forbid to do what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited of God, who knoweth the end of all things.

I preach unto you publickly the torments of Hell; such as shall believe, and do good works, shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive pardon of their sins, and a precious treasure; they that shall endeavour to make void the faith, shall be damned. We sent our Prophet to read only our Commandments to the people; the unbelievers read many things that are not in the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran;</hi> but God hath made vain what the Devil had there inserted, and confirmed the precepts of his Law: What the Devil there inserted, serveth for s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Such as have the knowledge of Scripture, know that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is truth it self, which proceedeth from thy Lord: They believe in it, and humble their heart in reading it.

God is the greatest benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in the world; he shall give them to enter where they shall desire; he is omniscient, and most merciful. The believers that shall take revenge of the injury that the unbelievers have done them, shall be protected of God: He is gracious and merciful towards his people; he maketh day to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into night, and night into day; he heareth the prayers of True believers, and seeth whatsoever they do; and will protect them, because he is truth it self. Idols are but vanity; and God is most high and omnipotent. Dost thou not consider that God sendeth the rain from Heaven, and that the Earth becometh green? He is benign to his people, and knoweth all [things] what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is in Heaven and Earth, is his; he hath no need of his people, and ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted. Seest thou not that God hath subjected to you all the beasts that are upon the earth? Seest thou not that the ship runneth upon the sea, through his command, to transport you and your substance? Seest thou not, that he hindreth Heaven to fall upon the Earth? certainly he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign, and merciful; He it is that hath given you life and death, he shall make you to die, and shall raise you again, nevertheless man is ingrateful for his favours. We have given a law to all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the World, to guide them into the right way; if they observe it, they will not dispute against thee. Invoke thy Lord, thou art in the right way; if they dispute against thee, say unto them, God knoweth all your actions, he shall judge your dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences at the day of Judgment: knowest thou not that God knoweth whatsoever is in heaven or in earth? All is written, and this is most easie to his
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:36900:177"/>
divine Majesty. Idolaters adore without reason, Idols that understand not whether they be gods or no, that shall be without protection at the day of Judgement; when they preach to men my Commandments, they know by their countenance those that are impious, and ingrateful for my graces; they would with wrath fall upon them that instruct them. Say unto them, I declare unto you things more grievous: God hath prepared the fire of hell to chastise Infidels. O people! A parable is related to you, hear it. All the Idols that ye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, cannot create a flie, when they shall be assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to do it; if the flies corrupt any thing that is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to them, they have not the power to drive them away, because of their impotency, and the weakness of them that adore them: They praise not God in that manner as is just and reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he is most strong, and most powerful; he hath chosen messengers to bear and execute his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments among Angels and men; he heareth whatsoever they say, beholdeth whatsoever they do, he knoweth whatsoever they have done, and all things obey him. O ye that believe! honor and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship your Lord, and do good, perhaps you shall be blessed: Fight for the establishment of his Law with affection, he hath chosen you to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it; he hath not given you a Law heavy and troublesom, It is the Law of <hi>Abraham</hi> your Father, he hath stiled you the Resigned to God, before the coming of the <hi>Alcoran:</hi> the Prophet shall testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie against you at the day of Judgment, and ye shall testifie against the people, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet hath preached to them the right way; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe in your prayers, pay tithes, and trust in God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is your Lord and your Protector.</p>

Certainly the true believers shall be blessed, that make their prayers with humility; they abstain from reviling, they pay tithes, they commit not whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, they touch not other women than their own, and their slaves; such as covet other, transgress the bounds of reason; they that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preserve what hath been entrusted to them; they that effect what they have promised, and that make their prayers at the time appointed, shall be heirs of Paradise, where they shall dwell eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. We formed man of the dust of the Earth, with mire, blood congealed, with a little flesh and bones, which we invested with skin; we another time created him, when we breathed to him the Soul into the Body, and blessed him, as one of our fairest Ornaments. O<note place="margin">See <hi>Galal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din.</hi>
                  </note> men! ye all shall die, and shall rise again at the Day of Judgment; we created above you, Seven Heavens, and have care of the conservation of all People that are beneath; we send Water from Heaven to satisfie your necessities; we make it to fall upon the Earth, and have power to cause to pass away and deprive you [of it.] We have created, and made gardens to bring forth Date<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, Grapes, and many other fruits, by which
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:36900:178"/>
ye live; we created trees in the Mountain of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> that produce.

We sent <hi>Noah,</hi> who spake to the People, and said, worship one God alone, what other god will ye implore but him? Will ye not fear to worship another? The chief among the People that were Idolaters, said to their adherents, This man is a man like your selves, he would appear, and be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed more than you; if God would be adored alone, as he saith, he would cause an Angel to descend, that should bring his Commandments; we have not heard spoken to our Predecessors, what he saith; he is a man possessed of the Devil, tarry, and ye shall see what will become of him: Then <hi>Noah</hi> said, Lord, protect me against them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend me from their Blasphemies; we commanded him to build an Ark, when our Commandment was given to destroy the wicked, and when the Water of his Caldron boyled, we command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to enter into the Ark, with two beasts of every kind and species; all men we destroyed, except them of whom we have before spoken, (we said unto him) speak not to me for Infidels, they shall be drowned, when thou shalt have taken order for every thing that must enter into the Ark with thee. Say, praise be to God, who hath delivered us from the malice of the wicked; Lord, give us to descend in a blessed place, thou art the best Pilot in the World. It was a sign of my Omnipotency to prove the People of <hi>Noah:</hi> We created after them another People, to whom we sent an Apostle, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:36900:178"/>
them to worship one God; and he said, What God will ye adore other than God? Will ye not fear his wrath? Their Doctors that were impious, who denied the Resurrection of the flesh, and on whom we had conferred the Wealth of the Earth, said, he is a man, he eateth and drinketh like you, if ye obey not a man like to your selves, shall ye be destroyed? Doth he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise you to return into the World, after having been bones and dust? O abuse! O abuse! ye are abused in what he promiseth, he is a man like others, he is a lyar, we will not believe him: That Apostle said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lord, preserve me from their Blasphemies, they shall repent suddenly of their impiety; then thunder surprised them, and destroyed them, as they deserved, we made the Land dry and barren without fruit, and created other persons in their place. Man cannot die before his hour, and none can retard it; we sent our Apostles and our Prophets to instruct the People, but they were slain one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, every Nation traduced the Prophet that we sent them, and we made them serve for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to Posterity, and destroyed the wicked. We sent <hi>Moses</hi> and his Brother <hi>Aaron</hi> to <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and his Doctors, with our Miracles, and with most intelligible reasons; they arose against the Faith, they tormented the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> and said, shall we believe in a man like to our selves, of them that obey us? They slandred both of them, and were in number of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. We gave to <hi>Moses</hi> the Book of the Law, peradventure it will guide the Children of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> into the right way; we created <hi>Iesus,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> his Mother, they are signs of our Unity; we established them in an eminent place, where they stayed near a Fountain. O Apostles and
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:36900:179"/>
Prophets! eat of the Fruits of the Earth, and do good, I know whatsoever ye do; your Law is one Law, and I alone am your Lord; take heed to your selves, follow not the Law of the Infidels, every one liketh what he doth, depart from the wicked, and leave them in their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, an account shall be required of them of the riches, and of the Children that we have given them, but they know it not. Such as fear the punishment of their Lord, that obey his Commandments, profess his Unity, give Alms of the substance that he hath given them, and fear in their Heart, that they are not acceptable to them, shall appear in his presence; such as shall obey him, shall enjoy his grace; he requireth not of any man what he is unable to perform. We have a Book that declareth the truth, no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice shall be done to him that shall do what he is able; certainly the Infidels are in ignorance of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> they act what is quite contrary, to that which is commanded True believers; but we have punished the chief among them in their prosperity. Be not this Day resolute, ye shall not be protected of us. Our Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are taught you, nevertheless ye are return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon your steps, and are risen against the Faith, and in discoursing by Night, withdrew your selves from the Righteous. Consider they not the words [of the <hi>Alcoran?</hi>] Doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any thing that hath not been ordained to their Predecessors? Know they not the Prophet that God hath sent to them? Wherefore will they not acknowledg him? Will they say that he is possessed of the Devil? On the contrary, he teacheth them the truth, nevertheless the greatest part of them detest him; if their will had place, Heaven and Earth, and whatsoever is
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:36900:179"/>
betwixt them, should be confounded; we have instructed them in the Law, which they ought to observe, but they have renounced it; Dost thou require of them any recompence for thy instructions? Thy Lord shall reward thee, there is none that is of power to recompence thee better than He. Call them to the right way; such as shall not believe the Resurrection, shall err. If we pardon and deliver them from afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they will still continue in their errors, to their confusion; we heretofore chastised them, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless they humble not themselves, neither implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their Lord; and when we opened upon them the gate of our Judgments, they became desperate. God hath given you sight, hearing and sense<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but few among you return him thanks; he it is that hath created you of earth, ye shall one day be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled before him to be judged; he it is that giveth life and death, and maketh the difference of day and night, will you not honor him, neither consider? On the contrary, they have said, as did their predecessors, wherefore shall we die? our bones shall be dust, and shall we rise again? This was heretofore promised to our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to us, certainly it is but an old song; Say unto them, to whom appertaineth the earth, and whatsoever is in the earth, if ye know [its Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator and King?] They will say, it is God's; Say unto them, know ye not then, that he that created you can raise you again? Who is Lord of the seven heavens? who possesseth the throne of heaven? They will say, it is God; say unto them, will ye not fear then to worship any other God but him? Say unto them, who is King of all things? who sustaineth them, and is sustained of none? They will say, that it is God; Say unto them, why then do ye deceive your selves? we have
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:36900:180"/>
taught them the truth, but they have rejected it, and said, that God had a son; were there another God with God, the one would undo what the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath done, and they would rise the one against the other. Praised be God, what they affirm is not true, God knoweth that is past, the present and the future, he hath no companion; Say, Lord, give me to see the effect of all that thou hast promised to them, and put me not among the unjust, deliver us from evil, and do good to us, I know their impiety; Lord deliver me from the temptations of the devil, deliver me from their malice; when any one among them dieth, he saith, Lord, permit me to return into the world, I will do better than I have done; there is no return, it is to speak in vain, there is an obstacle behind them, that detaineth them until the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; when the Trumpet shall sound, nothing shall retard them, they shall not glory, nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with each other; the ballance of the blessed shall be heavy with good works, and the ballance of the cursed shall be light of good works. Have not my Commandments been preached unto you, wherefore did ye contemn them? They shall say, Lord, our misery prevailed over us, we are mislead, Lord deliver us from this misery, the contrary was promised to us, truly we are exceedingly too blame. It shall be said unto them, depart into the fire, and never speak to come out. Many of them that worship me, say, Lord, we believe in thee, pardon our sins, thou art merciful. Ye have derided them, O ye wicked! and have despised my Commandments, but I will reward them for their perseverance, and they shall be blessed. It shall be said to those that rise again, how many years have ye remained in the earth? they shall answer, we have been there a day, or some days;
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:36900:180"/>
ask of the Angels appointed to keep the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, ye have been there but a litte time, did ye know it, do ye believe that I have created, and assembled you before me in vain? Praise and exalt God, King of Truth, there is no God but he, he is King of heaven; he is void of reason that invoketh another god with Him, he shall give account of his actions, and the Infidels shall be miserable: Say, Lord, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the sins of the righteous, thou art the great merciful.</p>

them that were taught your Predecessors, to be preached to the Righteous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God illuminateth the Heaven and the Earth, as the Lamp that is in the Lanthorn of Chrystal, fed with Oyl of the blessed Olive; it seemeth to be a Star full of Light, which goeth neither to the West, nor to the East, and yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth brightness upon brightness; God guideth by his light whom it pleaseth him, he teacheth his People Parables, and is Omniscient; he permitteth you to praise him in your Houses, there to be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his name, and to exalt him evening and morning. Oh ye men! your affairs ought not to hinder your remembrance of his divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, to make your prayers at the time appointed, neither to pay Tithes. Fear the day when the hearts of men shall be perplexed, and their sight troubled, when God shall reward and chastise every one after his works, and shall augment his grace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the good; he enricheth with his innumerable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits whom to him seemeth good. The good works of the wicked are like to mists in a spacious plain, they seem to be water when afar off, and being approached, nothing is to be there found; They shall find before God the Book, wherein is written whatsoever they have done, he shall punish them according to their demerits, he is exact to keep account. Their actions are moreover like to the darkness that is in the bottom of the sea, that is covered with wave upon wave, obscurity and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness upon one another; he that is in this darkness cannot see his hand; he that shall not be illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God, shall not see a jot: Seest thou not, that whatsoever is in Heaven and Earth exalteth the glory of God? the Birds extend their wings before him to praise him, he heareth the prayers of all his creatures, and understandeth the praises that they give him, he knoweth all that they

do, he is King of Heaven and earth, the refuge of all the world: Seest thou not how he assembleth the clouds? how he placeth them one upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other? Considerest thou not how the rain falleth through their pores? and that God causeth fresh water to descend from the mountains? He hath given it to whom seemeth good to him, he causeth the brightness of lightning to approach men, which blindeth their sight, and over whelmeth the day with night? These things are signs of his omnipotency, to them that consider them: He created of a little water, all sorts of living Creatures; some creep upon the Earth, others walk upon two feet, and others upon four; he created what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him, he is omnipotent.

                  </gap> a Law clear and intelligible, to conduct into the right way whom it shall seem good to him. The Infidels say, We believe in God, and his Prophet: nevertheless a party among them abandon his Law, and believe not in his divine Majesty: When they are called before God, and before the Prophet, to judge their differences, many among them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to come; if they come, it is with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. They are greatly afflicted at heart, do they fear that God and his Prophet will do them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice? On the contrary, they themselves are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just. When the True believers are called before God, and the Prophet, to be judged, they say, We have heard and obeyed; they are not ignorant. Those that shall obey God, and his Prophet, shall be blessed. Many swear to fight, gallantly for the Faith, when they shall be commanded to march against the enemy; say unto them, Swear not, your obedience to the Prophet shall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to your oaths, God knoweth whatsoever ye do; say unto them, Obey God, and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; if they be disobedient, they shall bear
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:36900:183"/>
their burden, and ye shall bear your own; if ye obey, ye shall follow the right way. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is obliged onely to preach intelligibly; God promiseth to the True believers, that shall do good works, that they shall live long upon Earth, as he promised to them that were before them, that they might establish the Law that he gave them; he shall change their fear into assurance; he shall deliver them from terror, that they may adore him alone, without Companion. He that is wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will depart from the obedience which he oweth to God: Make your prayers at the time appointed, pay Tithes, and obey the Prophet, God shall give you his mercy. Believe not that the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels are more powerful on Earth than we; they shall be precipitated into the fire of Hell. O ye that are True believers! your Slaves and your Servants of free-condition shall require leave of you, to enter where ye shall be thrice, <hi>viz.</hi> Before the Prayer at break of Day, after Noon, and after Supper; they shall not offend in entring without leave, where ye shall be at another time; they enter there to serve you. In this manner doth God teach you his Commandments, he knoweth the humor of his Creatures, and is most prudent in all that he ordaineth. It is ordained to your Children, when they shall be at age of discretion, to demand of you permission to do what they shall desire, as did your Predecessors: Thus doth God teach you his Commandments; he is gracious and merciful. The old and decrepit Women shall not offend God, to quit their vails, and discover their faces; provided it be without vanity, and design to shew their Ornaments: If they abstain, they shall do well, God heareth whatsoever ye say, and knoweth all that is in your hearts. The Blind, the Lame, the Sick, and you also, shall

When ye shall enter into any House, salute each other from God, with blessing and affection. Thus doth God teach you his Commandments, peradventure you will learn them. When those that believed in God, and his Prophet, repaired to the Prophet, they retired not without his permission. Such as required leave (to depart) believe in God, and his Prophet; if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire leave of thee for any business, licence whom shall seem good to thee, and pray to God for them; he is gracious and merciful.

Heavens and Earth; he hath no Son, nor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion in his Reign; he created and ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every thing. The Infidels worship Gods that can create nothing, and are things created; they can neither do them good nor evil, they can give neither Life nor Death, neither cause them to rise again. They say that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is but a fable of thine inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, invented with the assistance of some other Person; but they lye and blaspheme. They say that it is but an old Song, and a fable of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients that thou writest, and that thou studiest Morning and Evening. Say unto them, It was sent by him that knoweth all things in Heaven and Earth, altogether gracious and merciful. They said, Who is this Prophet? He eateth Bread and Meat, and walketh through the streets; we will not believe him, unless that an Angel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend from Heaven to preach to us with him; unless that Angel enrich him, and that he have a Garden full of good and savory fruits; he is but a Wizard, or one possessed of the Devil. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider to what they compare thee; certainly they are in error, and cannot find the right way. Praise and bless him that is able to bestow on thee a greater good, when it shall seem good to thee, to wit, Gardens, wherein flow many Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and Houses of pleasure. They have denyed the certainty of Universal Judgment, and we have prepared the Fire of Hell to punish them; wrath shall carry them away with terrible crys: when they shall behold the place of the assembly of Judgment; when they shall there appear, they shall be desperate, and shall cry, O misery! Cry not O misery, cry O miseries! (in the Plural) Ask of them which is better, and more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous, that, or Paradise, which is prepared for
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:36900:185"/>
the recompence of the righteous, where they shall dwell eternally with all manner of felicity; this is it that God hath promised, and that which was impetrated of his Divine Majesty, (for them that have his fear before their eyes) I will one day assemble Idolaters, with their Idols; God shall say unto them, you are they who have sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced my creatures from the right way; they shall say, praised be thy Name; we ought to have wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped none but thy Divine Majesty; but the wealth that thou gavest to our Magistrates, and their life, which thou didst prolong, caused them to forget thy Commandments; they were pernicious men, in that they abjured thy Law, they cannot this day be exempt from the punishment of our crimes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther protect us against thy wrath. The Idolaters shall be rigorously punished; the Prophets that we sent before thee, did eat Bread and Meat, and walked through the streets; we prove them one after another: Persevere, God beholdeth them that are patient. Those that believe not in the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, have said, The Angels are not descended from Heaven, we have not seen God; they are become proud, and are fallen into an exceeding great error, but the wicked shall one day be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out comfort; when they see the Angels, they shall cry, help, help! We will set before their eyes all the sins that they have committed; the good works which they shall think to have done, shall be like to dust, which the wind carryeth away; and the blessed shall enjoy a most certain good, they shall hear of nothing but what contenteth them. When the Heaven and the Air shall divide themselves, and the Angels shall descend, then shall the truth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and the merciful shall Reign; that day shall be tedious to Infidels, they shall bite their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and say, would to God I had followed

the Prophet and his Apostle! Oh misery! would to God I had not contracted amity with such an Infidel, he seduced me from the right way, he hindred me to believe in the <hi>Alcoran</hi> which God sent; certainly the Devil hath tempted men. Then shall the Prophet say, Lord, such as have followed me, have obeyed what is written in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and the Infidels have rejected it. We have appointed an enemy among the wicked, to every Prophet of them that were before thee, but it sufficeth thee that God guideth and protecteth thee. The Infidels have demanded, if the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> was sent all at once; I have so done to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the truth in thy heart, I have sent it piece by piece, they shall not shew thee any thing like unto it; I have instructed thee in the Truth, clear and intelligible; the incredulous shall be confined in the Fire of Hell, and be most miserable. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, We gave to <hi>Moses</hi> the Book of the Law, we sent with him his Brother <hi>Aaron</hi> to assist him, and said unto them, Go both of you, preach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Infidels, we will destroy them, unless they be converted. When the People of <hi>Noah</hi> despised our Commandment, we drowned them, and made them serve for example to Posterity, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared great torments for the impious. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Aad, Temod,</hi> and those that dwelt nigh unto the Well, a long time after them; we spake to them in Parables, and destroyed them. Oh ye wicked! consider the misery of the City, upon which fell that mischievous Rain, that destroyed them, because the Inhabitants believed not in the Resurrection. When the Infidels saw thee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, they derided thee, and said, This Prophet would seduce us, and make us to abandon our God; we had patience, and deferred our punishment: They shall know at the Day of Judgment them

that have been seduced; Hast thou considered the action of him that spake of his God after his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie? Wert thou his Tutor, to hinder him to speak? Dost thou believe that the greatest part of the wicked, hear, and understand what thou speakest to them? They are like Beasts, and worse; Seest thou how thy Lord sheddeth the Rose? Were it his will, it should be permanent, the Sun hath caused it to melt, and attracteth it gently to himself. He it is that created the Night for repose, and the Day for labour. He it is that sendeth the Winds by his special grace, he maketh Rain to descend from Heaven, to refresh the Earth, to give it life, to water the beasts, and for the contentment of men; we have divided it among them, that they may be mindful of our grace, nevertheless, the greatest part of them are ungrateful. Had we so pleased, we had sent to every City a preacher, to preach unto the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants the Torments of Hell; obey not Infidels, preach to them frequently what is written in the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> It is God that hath sweetned the water of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> that joyned the two Seas, that made them Salt, and put between them a separation, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them to mix: He created Man and Woman of a little water, to increase and multiply together; thy Lord can do whatsoever him pleaseth, yet do the Infidels adore what can neither benefit nor hurt them, and assist the devil their master to tempt the world; We sent thee only to preach the torments of hell, and to proclaim the joys of Paradise: Say unto them, I require not of you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for my preaching, he that shall be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, will follow the way of his Law: Praise and exalt thy Lord, trust in him, he knoweth all the sins of men; he created the heavens, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

this of him that knoweth it. When it was said to the Infidels, worship the merciful [God;] they said, what merciful? shall we worship what ye appoint us? and they added to their impiety.

Do they good unto you when ye wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship them, or mischief when ye neglect them? they answered, We find that our Fathers wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped them as we do; <hi>Abraham</hi> said unto them, you and your Fathers worship vain things, ye adore only Idols, mine Enemies; I will not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship them, I will worship the Lord of the World, who created, guideth, and nourisheth me, who giveth me health when I am sick, who maketh me to live, and will cause me to die, and from whom I hope for pardon of my Sins at the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Lord give me the knowledg of thy will, grant that my Tongue and Words may be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited as true, by Posterity; put me into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Heirs of Paradise; pardon my Father, who hath been in the number of the erroneous, and make me not ashamed at the Day of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection; at the Day, when riches and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren shall be unprofitable, except to such as shall have an heart estranged from Impiety; God shall make the righteous to approach to Paradise, and the wicked to see Hell: They shall say, Can the Idols that ye adore save you?

He said, I know not what they do, my Lord keepeth accompt of their actions; if ye knew the right way, ye would not worship Idols; I drive not true believers from my society, I am sent only to preach the torments of Hell. They said, O <hi>Noah!</hi> if thou quit not this discourse, thou shalt be stoned; <hi>Noah</hi> said, Lord, this people is impious, judge our difference, deliver me from their malice, and all true believers that are with me; We preserved him, and those that were with him in the Ark, and destroyed them that remained on the earth: This is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our Omnipotency, yet the greatest part of Infidels believe not that God is omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent and merciful.

Throne, I have found that she with her Subjects adore the Sun, the Devil caused them to delight in this their action, he hath seduced them from the right way, and they shall be in error until they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship one God, who sendeth Rain from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and maketh the Earth to produce Plants and Fruits, who knoweth whatsoever is in the hearts of men, and what they utter; God! There is but one God, Lord of the Universe. <hi>Solomon</hi> said, I shall soon see if thou speak truth, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou be in the number of the Lyars; Go, bear to her this Letter, and observe what she and her People shall answer; at her arrival, the Queen said to her Ministers, Oh ye that are raised to dignity in my dominions; a Letter is given me from <hi>Solomon,</hi> of this tenour. In the Name of God gracious and merciful, rise not up against me, and obey me. Give me counsel, what I ought to do, I will do nothing without your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and what you see not with your eyes: They answered, Our welfare and misery depend on thee, command whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:36900:192"/>
we will obey thee. She said, When Kings enter a City, they introduce many disorders; they abase, and humble the chief of the Inhabitants, and the most eminent; if <hi>Solomon</hi> and his People come hither, they will use [us] in the like manner. I think it requisite to send to him an Ambassador with some presents, perhaps he will take a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to return. When the Ambassador arrived in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s presence, he said unto him, Do ye bring me presents?

They spake to her to enter into a gallery; when she beheld the pavement, she believed it to be Water; and in lifting up her Robe, fearing to wet it, discovered her Leg. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> told her, that the pavement was of pollished glass, and exhorted her to embrace the Law of God. Then she said, Lord, I am too blame, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving offended thee; I am obedient with <hi>Solomon,</hi> to the Commandments of the God of the Universe. We sent <hi>Salhe</hi> to <hi>Temod,</hi> and his People, to exhort them to worship one God: He said unto them, O People! flie to the Mercy of God; if ye im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore pardon of him, ye shall be pardoned. They said, Wouldst thou draw us into thine error? And into the error of them that are with thee? He said, God shall chastise you, ye are Seditious. They were Nine persons in the City that defiled the Earth, and did no good; they said among them, Let us this Night kill the Prophet, and his adherents: We will say to them that seek him, That we saw him not, neither them that slew him; and will swear that we speak truth: They were cunning, but we were more subtil than they, and they knew it not. Consider what was the issue of their stratagems; we destroyed them with their followers; and their Houses are become de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart, because of their impiety. This shall serve for example to them that have knowledg of our Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency: We served the Prophet, and all the True believers that were with him. Remember thou the History of <hi>Lot,</hi> who said to his Citizens, Will ye alway defile your selves in uncleanness, in each others view? Will ye love men more than women? Ye are ignorant. They replyed, Let us drive <hi>Lot</hi> and his Family out of our City; they defile not themselves like us. We pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served

him, with all his Family, except his Wife; she remained among them that were chastised. We caused it to Rain upon them, a Rain that gave them to know the severity of our chastisements. Say unto them, Praised be God, that destroyeth the wicked, and Salvation to all those who he hath chosen; are they not more happy, than such as believe there are many Gods? Who created the Heavens and the Earth? Who caused Rain to fall from Heaven? Who hath made many delicious Gardens to bring forth? You have not the power to cause the plants to spring forth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the assistance of God. Certainly unbelievers do err from the right way. Who hath established the Earth, and made the Rivers to flow? Who hath made heavy the Mountains? Who but God hath put separation that is between Seas? The greatest part of the World know it not. Who rendreth men miserable? Who delivereth them from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction when they invoke him? Who hath caused you to multiply, and leave your Posterity on Earth, but God? Nevertheless few men give him thanks. Who guideth in the darkness of the Earth and Sea? Who but God sendeth the Winds, the forerunners of Rain? He is most high, and most powerful, but the wicked will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the effects of his Omnipotency. Who formeth men? Who maketh them to live, die, and rise again? Who enricheth them with the Wealth of Heaven, and of Earth, but God? Say unto them, produce your reasons, bring your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if what ye alledg be true; say unto them, None but God knoweth what is in Heaven and Earth, no man knoweth the future, present and past; do men know the day of the Resurrection? Contrariwise they doubt, and are blind. The wicked have said, What? we shall be dust, as
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:36900:194"/>
are our Fathers; and shall come forth out of our Graves! This was heretofore promised to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to us, this is but a Fable of old men: Tell them, that they consider not what was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore the end of the wicked; afflict not thy self, for that they conspire against thee, and that they demand at what time they shall see the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is foretold them: Say unto them, it is not far from you, ye throw your selves headlong into it, but God is pitiful towards his People, nevertheless the greatest part give him no thanks for his Grace, thy Lord knoweth what is in their Heart, and whatsoever they speak; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Heaven or Earth, that is not written in a most intelligible Book; the <hi>Alcoran</hi> explaineth to the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> the greatest part of their difficulties, it will guide them in the right way, and deliver from Hell them that shall believe thee; thy Lord shall judge them at the day of Judgment, he is Omnipotent and wise; trust thou in God, thou art in the way of truth; the Dead and Deaf shall not hear thee, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers shall depart from thee pensive and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished; thou oughtest not to guide the blind, neither to make the deaf to hear, except such as shall believe in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and be obedient, when the time of the punishment that is denounced against them shall be come; we will cause a Beast to come from under the Earth, that shall speak unto them, and shall say, The People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not in the Law of God, they know not his wondrous works. Be thou mindful of the Day, when I will assemble a Multitude of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that have disobeyed my Commandments, to give account of their actions: I will say unto them, Ye have traduced my Prophets, ye know <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:36900:195"/>
and is most Wise. These mysteries are the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of the Book that distinguisheth the Truth from a Lye. I relate to thee the history of <hi>Moses,</hi> and of <hi>Pharoah</hi> with Truth, for the contentment of True believers. <hi>Pharoah</hi> was powerful on Earth, he entreated his Subjects as seemed good to him, he tormented one party, and murthered their Children, he abused their Wives, and was of them that defiled the Earth; I gave my Grace to them that were afflicted on Earth; I made them successors of <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s Kingdom, I established them in his Dominions; I made <hi>Pharoah, Haman,</hi> and their Army to see what they most feared; we said to the Mother of <hi>Moses,</hi> give suck to thy Child; if thou fearest that they will mischief him, cast him upon <hi>Nile,</hi> fear not, neither afflict thy self, I will restore him to thee between thine Arms, and place him in the number of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. The domestiques of <hi>Pharoah</hi> found him upon the Water, and saved him, to be one day their enemy, and to torment them, because <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah, Haman,</hi> and their People were Infidels. <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s wife said unto him, I entreat thee not to suffer this Infant to be slain, mine eyes rejoyce to see him, he shall one day be profitable for our service, as our Son; but they were ignorant of what should befal them; the Heart of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was freed from fear, when she behold him in the hands of <hi>Pharorh</hi>'s wife, and scarce could she refrain to let them know that she was his Mother; we caused her to have patience, and she had faith in our promises: she spake to his sister to follow him step by step, she followed afar off, without intimation that she was his sister, or that she regarded him. We had before prohibited <hi>Moses</hi> to suck the milk of any other nurse, than that of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:36900:195"/>
his mother; his sister said to <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s servant, will ye that I provide you a nurse, and people that shall carefully nourish him? We caused him to be restored to his mother, to nurse him; she ceased from her sadness, when she knew, and saw that God was sincere in what he had promised, but the greatest part of the people know it not. When <hi>Moses</hi> was aged, about thirty three years, we gave him knowledg and wisdom; thus do I reward the righteous; <hi>Moses</hi> entring one day into the City, met two men that fought; the one was of the Children of Israel, and the other was an Egyptian, and of his enemies, whom he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted and slew; after this he said the Devil tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted me, he is the open enemy of men; Lord, I have offended thee, pardon me; he pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, he is gracious and merciful; Lord, since thou hast been so gracious to me, I will never give aid or succour to Infidels. He contined in the City with fear, and kept himself upon his guard; on the morrow he again met him, whom the day before he had defended, who fought likewise with another Egyptian, and required his assistance; <hi>Moses</hi> said unto him, Thou art se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious; he replyed, oh <hi>Moses!</hi> wilt thou slay me, as thou didst slay him yesterday? Wilt thou be a murtherer of all men, or a just man? Not long after a man came [in hast] to him from the utmost part of the City, who said unto him, oh <hi>Moses!</hi> the Officers of <hi>Pharoah</hi> have conspired against thee, they desire to put thee to death, save thy self, and follow my counsel; He depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the City with fear, keeping himself up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his guard, beseeching his Lord to deliver him from the hands of Infidels; he went towards <hi>Madian,</hi> and said, Lord suffer me not to follow
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:36900:196"/>
an evil way; He met a great number of persons that made their flocks to drink, he with them found two maids that could not water their Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, he said unto them, what do ye two do here? We have not strength to draw water to give our beasts to drink, we tarry for the Shepherd, our father is too old to draw [it.] He drew water out of the well to water their Cattel, and withdrew to a shade, because of the heat of the Sun, saying, Lord, I am deprived of all the graces which heretofore thou didst confer on me; I am now poor and necessitous. One of those maidens came to seek him, and bashfully said unto him, My father calleth thee, to recompence thee for the pains thou hast taken in watering our cattel; When he was in the old mans pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, he related what had befaln him. The old man said, Fear nothing, I will deliver thee from the hands of the wicked; one of his daughters said to her sister, Give to this man to eat, and reward his pains, he assisted us with affection; their Father said unto him, I will marry thee to one of my two daughters, on condition, that thou wilt have a care of my flocks the space of eight years; ten years if it please thee, said <hi>Moses;</hi> I will not forsake thee, thou shalt find me an honest man, I will serve thee the two terms, either eight or ten years, as shall seem good to thee, God is witness of what I say. After the term expired, <hi>Moses</hi> forsook the house of his father in law; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing with his wife, he beheld afar off a great fire on the side of the mountain, and said to his wife, tarry here, I see the fire of the Omnipotent, I will speedily return, I will bring you a spark, peradventure you shall be warmed: when he drew near to this fire, they cried unto him from
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:36900:196"/>
the right side of the valley, from an eminent place, and from a bush, Oh <hi>Moses!</hi> I am God, Lord of the Universe, cast thy staff on the ground; when he beheld his staff to move, as it had been alive, he fled for fear, and returned no more: O <hi>Moses!</hi> draw near, and fear not, thou art in a place of safety, put thine hand into thy pocket, it shall come out white and shining, without harm; draw back thine arm into thy sleeve, it shall return to its former condition; thy staff and thine hand shall be two signs of my Omnipotency to <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his Ministers, who disobey my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; <hi>Moses</hi> said, Lord, I have slain an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> I am afraid they will take away my life, command <hi>Aaron,</hi> who is eloquent, to go with me, to aid me, and to confirm what I shall say, I fear they will tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me; I will give thee thy brother for thine assistant, I will give to you both strength to defend your selves from their malice; go, do what is commanded you, ye shall be victorious, and all those that shall follow you: when <hi>Moses</hi> came to <hi>Pharoah,</hi> he made him to see my miracles, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched my Commandments to his Ministers; they said, this is but magick and witchcraft, we have not heard these things to have been spoken to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors. <hi>Moses</hi> said, the Lord knoweth him that teacheth the right way, and him that ought to have part in Paradise, Infidels shall be most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. <hi>Pharoah</hi> said to his Ministers, do ye know any other God but me?

of unbelievers; we abandoned them, and they are in the number of the condemned to the fire of hell. They shall find none to protect them at the day of Judgment; we cursed them on earth, and at the day of the Resurrection they shall be abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to all the world. We taught <hi>Moses</hi> our Commandments, after the destruction of many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels before his coming. We gave him the Book, to be a light to the people, to conduct them into the right way, and acquire our grace, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture they will remember. Thou wert not with <hi>Moses</hi> when we spake to him; to him we created another age after him, thou didst not at that time dwell with the Inhabitants of <hi>Madian,</hi> neither didst thou teach them our Commandments; it is we that have instructed thee in the History of past ages; thou wert not on the mountain when we spake to <hi>Moses;</hi> we sent thee through our special grace, to preach to men the torments of hell; they have not yet had a preacher like unto thee, perhaps they will consider it; when they felt any punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their sins, they said, Lord, hadst thou sent us an Apostle to instruct us, we should have obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy Commandments, and have believed in thy Law: and when on our part they were instructed in the Truth, they said, doth <hi>Mahomet</hi> work mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles like <hi>Moses?</hi> Do they not traduce what <hi>Moses</hi> did, when they say, that <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Mahomet</hi> are two apparent Sorcerers? and when they said that they believed neither Prophet, nor Scripture? Say unto them, bring any book from God, that bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter teacheth the right way than the Old Testament, and more savingly than the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> I will follow it, if ye speak the truth: If they be not heard when they shall require this book, know, that they follow only their own appetites and their impiety; who is more erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:36900:197"/>
than he that followeth but his own passion, and is not guided of God? He guideth not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels; Certainly we have sent them the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> peradventure they will believe in it; they, to whom we heretofore sent this Book, believe in the contents thereof; when they hear it read, they say, we believe in those words, it is the very Truth that proceedeth from God; we believe in the Unity of his Divine Majesty, they shall be doubly rewarded, because they have persevered in well-doing; they have overcome evil through their good deeds, and have expended in good works part of the Wealth that we gave them. When they heard the Faith evil spoken of, they withdrew themselves, took leave of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and said, Ye shall answer for your selves, and we for our actions. Regard not the ignorant, thou shalt not convert all them that thou shalt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to convert; God converteth, and guideth into the right way whom he pleaseth, and knoweth such as serve him. They said, if I follow with thee the right way, I must forsake my Country. Shall not I establish them in a place of safety, where they shall find all sorts of fruits to enrich them? But the greatest part of the People know it not. How many Cities have we destroyed, that took pleasure in their evil life? No man inhabited them any more, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept very few, and we became heirs of their riches. God shall not destroy <hi>Mecca,</hi> until he have sent an Apostle to instruct the Inhabitants thereof in the right way: God destroyeth not a City, if the Inhabitants be not unjust, and disobey not his Commandments; the Wealth of this World which ye possess, pleaseth you, but the Riches of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are much better, and eternal; will ye not understand it? Have we not kept promise with them to whom we promised Paradise? And with
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:36900:198"/>
them to whom we promised the Riches of this World, and in the end were in the number of the damned? Be thou mindful of the day when thy Lord shall call them, and say unto them, where are your Idols, which ye believed to be my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions? The chief of them shall say, Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold those that were seduced like us, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of their Idolatry, they adored not us; they shall speak that day to the Idolaters to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke their Idols, but they shall not hear them, they shall be visibly chastised on Earth: Be thou mindful of the day when thy Lord shall call them, and say unto them, Wherefore have ye not believed my Apostles and my Prophets? They shall be confounded, and remain dumb. He that shall be converted, and do good works, shall be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. Thy Lord createth what pleaseth him, and maketh choice of what seemeth to him good. Praised be God, he hath no Companion, he knoweth what is in the hearts of men, and what they make manifest; he is God, there is no God but he, praise is due to him in the beginning, and in the end, he commandeth over all things, and all People shall one day be assembled before him to be judged; say unto them, Had God given a continual Night, even until the Day of Judgment, what other God is there that is able to give you light? Will ye not hear me? Had God given you a continual Day until the Day of Judgment, what other God could have given the Night to refresh you? Will ye not consider his benefits and his grace? He hath created the Night for repose, and the Day for Labour, peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ye will give him thanks. Be thou mindful of the Day, when thy Lord shall call the Infidels, and shall say unto them, where are the Idols that ye worshipped? We will call a witness
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:36900:198"/>
of every Nation, and will say to the Idolaters, Bring your arguments that may prove the Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Gods; Ye shall this day know your Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemies, and that there is but one God. <hi>Caron</hi> was of the People of <hi>Moses,</hi> he was proud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of his riches; we gave so great trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, that many men were burthened when they conveyed away the Keyes. Remember how his People said unto him, Rejoyce not above measure in thy great wealth, God abhorreth them that rejoyce without reason; beg of him Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise; with thy Riches forget not to do good in this World, give alms of the substance which God hath given thee, be not disobedient to him on Earth, he abhorreth those that disobey him; these Riches were given thee, because thou didst instruct the People in the Old Testament; knowest thou not that God destroyed in times past many rich and opulent persons? Who is more strong, more powerful, more rich than God?

               <p>IN the Name of God, gracious and merciful. I am God most Wise. Men have believed that it is sufficient to say, We believe in God, and that they be not proved: Certainly God proved their Predecessors, and knew such as were zealous in his Law, and them that were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels. Do they who have done evil, think to escape the punishment of their Crimes, and
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:36900:199"/>
not to be judged? Such as hope to see God, shall behold him at the time appointed by his divine Majesty; he understandeth and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things. He that fighteth for the faith, fighteth for his soul: certainly God hath no need of men, their sins shall be pardoned who shall believe in his divine Majesty, and shall do good works. We enjoyned the children of Israel to honour their father and mother, and to do good to them; if they press thee to worship many Gods, thou shalt be damned, if thou give ear to them; obey them not in this matter, ye shall be assembled before me, I will set before you all that ye have done, I will reward you according to your works, and place such as shall have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served my Law in the number of the blessed. There be men who affirm, that they believe in God, and are impatient when evil befalleth them from God to prove them: If God give victory to the True believers, they say, that they are on their side, but doth not God know what is in their heart? He knoweth them that believe in his Law, and those that are impious. The Infidels said to the True believers, do like us, follow our way, we will bear your sins; They will not bear them, they are lyars, they shall bear their own burdens; shall not an account of their sins be required of them at the day of Judgment? We sent <hi>Noah</hi> to instruct men, he lived upon the Earth nine hundred and fifty years. The Flood sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, and destroyed the people of his time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were unjust, and we saved <hi>Noah,</hi> and those that were with him in the Ark; this ought to serve for example to all the world. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Abraham,</hi> who said to his people, Adore one God, and fear him, ye shall do well, if ye have knowledge to comprehend it; ye worship
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:36900:200"/>
but Idols, and are but lyars, those whom ye worship cannot benefit you, implore succor of God, worship him, and give him thanks for his graces, ye shall one day appear before him, if ye traduce me; those that were before you tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Prophets, Gods Messengers: Messengers are obliged only to discharge their message; are ye ignorant that God causeth men to dye, and shall raise them again? it is a thing easie to God: Walk through the Earth, and consider how God hath extirpated your predecessors, and created after them another people, certainly he is omnipotent. He punisheth and pardoneth as he seeth good, you all shall one day be assembled before him to be judged; you shall not render him impotent, either in Earth, or in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; ye shall find none of power to protect, or defend you against his divine Majesty; such as obey not his Commandments, who believe not the resurrection, and despair of his mercy, shall suffer great torments. The people answered, kill <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and burn him; but God delivered him from the fire that they had kindled, which shall serve for example to True believers. He said unto them, ye adore only Idols, because of your love to the wealth of the world; ye shall despise and curse each other at the day of Judgment. Hell shall be your habitation, and ye shall be deprived of prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. <hi>Lot</hi> believed in his words, and said, I will retire to the place which my Lord shall appoint me; he alone is omnipotent, and most wise. We gave to <hi>Abraham</hi> two sons, <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob;</hi> we caused Prophets to be be born of his race, and taught his progeny the Scripture; we rewarded him in this world, and he shall be at the day of judgment in the number of the blessed. Remember <hi>Lot,</hi> who said to his people, Ye
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:36900:200"/>
defile your selves with filthiness, unknown to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny before you; ye incline to the love of men, ye rob upon the high ways, and defile one another. This people answered, Let us see the judgments of God, if what thou speakest be true. Then he said, Lord protect me against unbelievers. When our Messengers came towards <hi>Abraham,</hi> to declare to him that he should have children; they said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, We will ruine <hi>Lots</hi> City, and destroy all the inhabitants thereof, because they are impious. <hi>Abraham</hi> answered, <hi>Lot</hi> dwelleth in that City; they said, We know all that is within it, and we will preserve him, with all his family, except his wife, she shall be in the number of them that shall be punished. When our Messengers arived at <hi>Lots</hi> house, he was troubled, in that he had not strength sufficient to defend them from the malice of the people; they said unto him, Fear nothing, neither afflict thy self. We will preserve thee and all thy family, except thy wife; she shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide among them that shall be destroyed; we will cause the indignation of God to fall upon this City, because of their impiety; it shall serve for example to posterity, We sent <hi>Chaib</hi> ro his brethren, the inhabitants of <hi>Madian;</hi> he said unto them, Worship one God, fear the day of Judgment, and defile not the Earth.

of their crimes. We chastised some by an impetuous wind, and others were surprized by thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; we deprived them of their riches, and they were drowned. God was not unjust towards them, they drew mischief on themselves through their impiety. They that worship Idols are like to the Spider; she buildeth her house of her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I teach the people these parables, and none but the wise understand them. Truly God created Heaven and Earth, it is a sign of his Omnipotency to True believers. Instruct them in the book that is inspired into thee; make thy prayers at the time appointed, prayers divert men from sin; to be mindful of God is the best work thou canst perform, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the actions of men. Dispute with mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness against them that have knowledg of the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Law; except against the wicked that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. Say unto them, We believe in what hath been taught you, and in what hath been taught us: Your God, and our God is one God; we are resigned to his divine will. We have sent thee the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> as we sent to them the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Such as understand the Old Testament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Truth of the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> Thou hast not written it with thine own hand; hadst thou writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it, thou hadst caused them to doubt, who desire to make it void: Certainly it containeth, and teacheth intelligibly the Commandments of the Law; none but Infidels reject it. They have said, We will not believe in this Book, unless God work in it some miracle. Say unto them, Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles proceed from God, I am sent only to preach the torments of Hell. Is it not sufficient, that
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:36900:201"/>
we have sent thee the <hi>Alcoran</hi> to instruct them? It containeth the effects of my mercy and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, necessary for their salvation. Say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, it sufficeth that God is witness of mine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, betwixt you and me; he knoweth whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is in Heaven, and in Earth: They that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Idols, and have not faith in God, are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. They urge thee to make them see the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of their crimes; if the time were come, they should soon feel it; they shall rescent it, when they least think of it, but they know it not; they shall press thee to make them see it. Say unto them, Hell is prepared for Infidels. When they shall be plunged in torments over their heads, and under their feet, it shall be said unto them, Taste the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment which ye have deserved. O ye people that believe! The Earth is sufficiently large and spacious for you, to separate your selves from the wicked; worship me alone, all Creatures shall die, and be assembled before me to be judged. The True believers that shall have done good works, shall inhabit Paradise, wherein flow many rivers; wherein is the reward of the righteous, of them that persevere to do good, and are patient in their affliction, and trust in their Lord. How many beasts be there that have not wherewith to live? God nourisheth them, and you also; he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth and knoweth all things. If thou ask of the Infidels, who created Heaven and Earth, the Sun, and the Moon? they will say, It is God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then do they deny his Unity? God enricheth and impoverisheth whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If thou demand of them, who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the rain to fall from Heaven, to give life to the Earth, after the death thereof? they will say, It is God. Say unto them, Praised be God, that ye avouch it; nevertheless, the greatest part of
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:36900:202"/>
men understand it not. The life of this world is but sport and vanity, life is in Paradise, had they knowledge to comprehend it. When they enter into a ship, and see the tempest, they call upon God and protest to profess his Law: And when he hath preserved them on the Land, they are ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for his grace, and return to their Idolatry, they shall too late understand their error. Know they not that we have established in <hi>Mecca</hi> all safety and freedom? and that men are taken away by violence to be slain, and made slaves? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they in things unprofitable? shall they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful for the graces of God? who is more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious than he that blasphemeth against God, and impugneth the known Truth? is there no place in Hell for the wicked?

Certainly the greatest part of the people believe not in the Resurrection: Will they not consider the end of their predecessors; who were more powerful and wealthy than they? God hath sent to all an Apostle to teach them his Law, he hath done to them no injustice, they have drawn mischief on themselves through their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; the end of the wicked shall be like to their works, they despise the Commandments of God, and deride them, but God shall cause them to die, and rise again, and all shall be assembled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him at the day of Judgment; that day shall they be desperate, their Idols shall not intercede for them, they shall forsake them, and they shall be separated from the true believers. Such as believe in God, and do good works, shall enjoy the delights of Paradise, and the wicked shall be chastised according to their demerits. Praise God, pray unto him evening and morning, praise is due to him in heaven and earth; pray unto him before the Sun set, and at the hour of noon; he maketh the dead to come out of the living, and the living out of the dead; he causeth the barren earth to revive, and grow green after its death; in like manner will he cause you to arise again, and come out of your sepulchres: it is a sign of his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, to have created you of earth, to have given you flesh and bones, and to have created the woman (of the rib of the man) to dwell with him; he hath commanded you to love mutually,

Praised be God, he hath no companion; disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der appeared in the Earth, and in the Sea, because of the iniquities of men; peradventure they will be converted, when they shall feel the punishment of their Crimes: say unto them, Go throughout the Earth, and consider the end of your Predecessors, the greatest part of them were Idolaters; embrace the true Law before the Day cometh, when none shall be heard; that Day shall the wicked be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the good, the impious shall give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their impiety, and such as shall have lived well, shall enjoy the joys of Paradise, the Grace of God shall be their recompence, God abhorreth In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels. It is a sign of his Omnipotency, to send the Winds to bring you Rain, and make you to taste the Fruits of his Grace; the Ship runneth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Water through his permission, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of your commerce; will ye not be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him for his benefits?

There be who deride this Book, they ignorantly depart from the Law of God, and have despised it, but shall one day be severely punished: When they are taught the Commandments of God, they turn the back with disdain, they will not hear, and have Ears stopped; say unto them, You shall in the end suffer infinite pains: Such as believe in the Law of God, and do good works, shall eternally enjoy the Delights of Paradise; what God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth, is infallible, he is Omnipotent, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether wise, he created the Heaven, and sustaineth it without a Pillar, appearing to your Eyes; he lifted up the Mountains upon the Earth, to fasten and hinder it to move; he hath thereon dispersed many Beasts, and sent Rain from Heaven, which causeth Plants to spring forth, and Herbs of divers sorts.

O my Son! make thy prayers at the time appointed, do what is honest and civil, fly what is not approved, and be patient in thy adversities; regard not the World, disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered through pride; converse not with the proud, God detesteth the haughty; observe thy steps, walk with modesty, speak gently, they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that bray like Asses when they speak; seest thou not that God hath created for men all that is in Heaven and Earth, and conferreth on them his Graces in general, and particular? There be ignorant [persons] that dispute of the Deity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reason; when it is said unto them, Do what God hath appointed, they answer, We will do what we saw done by our Fathers. They consider not that the Devil calleth them and their Fathers

The impiety of the wicked ought not to afflict thee, they shall be one day assembled in our presence, to be chastised; I will shew them all that they have done, I know what is in the hearts of men, I will prolong awhile their punishment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, and precipitate them in the other World, into the Fire of Hell. Hast thou not demanded of them who created Heaven and Earth? They said, It is God; say unto them, therefore praised be God; nevertheless the greatest part of them are ignorant.

Oh Prophet! fear God, and obey not unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, God knoweth all things, and is most pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in what he ordaineth; observe what thy Lord hath taught thee, he knoweth the actions of men; recommend thy self to God, it ought to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice thee, that he protecteth thee. He hath not given two hearts unto men; he hath not enjoyned us to call your wives your mothers; those which you call your children, are not all your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ye speak it only with the mouth, but God always speaketh the truth, and guideth men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the way of salvation. Call your neighbour by the name of his father, this action shall be acceptable to God, provided that ye have no evil design in the heart; if ye know not his name, call him your brother in God, or Sir; God is gracious and merciful. The Prophet is obeyed of them that believe in God, and honour his wives, as their mothers. Kinsmen are heirs of each other, it is so appointed by his divine Majesty to the Believers that went out of <hi>Mecca</hi> to follow the Prophet: It is ordained in Scripture to do good to your parents. Remember thou that we received the promise of the Prophets of thee, of <hi>Noah,</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> and of Jesus the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> (to worship but one God) we received a strong promise: An accompt shall be required of their actions, and the wicked shall feel the rigour of infinite pains. Oh ye that

believe in God! remember his favour towards you; when ye were charged by troups of enemies, he sent against them an impetuous wind, and troups invisible to your eyes, to fight them; he seeth all that ye do; those invisible troups came from the East, and from the West, from above, and below, when your sight was troubled, and your hearts failed you, because of the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

thee because of their extreme avarice. Such men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not in God, he rendreth all their works un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful; it is a thing easie to his divine Majstey. The Troups of the Infidels believed they were invincible, and when they saw the troups of the True be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers they desired to flye. The Infidels desired to draw the <hi>Arabians</hi> to their party, and have intelligence to know in what condition you are; had they been of your party, few of them had been slain; the adhering to the Prophet of God serveth to you as a Cittadel, it serveth as a Bulwark to them that apprehend the day of Judgment, and think often on his divine Majesty. When the believers said, behold! what God and his Prophet promised us, they are sincere in their promises; the sight of their enemies encreased their faith and zeal towards God and his Prophet. There be persons among the True believers who have performed what they promised to God; many of them are dead in obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of his divine Majesty, others at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the same thing, and swerve not from what they have promised; God shall recompence them for their zeal, and chastise the Infidels, or pardon them if it so please him, he is gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful. God shall destroy the unbelievers with their wrath against the believers; he protecteth True believers in combats, he is strong and omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent. The Jews descended from their Fortress, to give aid to the Infidels, but God cast fear into their hearts; a party of them were slain, and the rest taken slaves; they by their death made you heirs of their lands, their houses, their riches, and fortresses which you were not able to conquer; God is omnipotent. Oh Prophet! if thy wives be too ambitious of the wealth of the earth, and of garments too sumptuous; Call them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Say

unto them, that thou wilt deal well with them, and wilt repudiate them with mildness and civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. If they love God and his Prophet, if they are virtuous, his divine Majesty will give them an exceeding great reward: Oh ye wives of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet! such of you as shall be unchast, shall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished doubly, more than other women, this is a thing easie to God; such among you as shall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey God and his Prophet, and shall do good works, shall be rewarded more than other women, an exceeding great reward is prepared for you. Oh ye wives of the Prophet! ye are not like other women of the world; fear God, and believe not in the discourse of such as have design to seduce you, speak with civility, abide in your houses; go not forth to make your beauty appear, and to make a shew, as did the ignorant of old; pray to God with affection, give alms, obey God and his Prophet, God will deliver you from his wrath, and will purifie you; be mindful of the Law that is taught you in your houses, he is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to them that honour him, he knoweth all the actions of the Prophet, he hath promised his mercy, and an exceeding great reward to those (men and women) that shall obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. Those men and women that believe in his unity, that resign themselves to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine pleasure, that are patient and humble, that speak the truth, that fast, give alms, and are chaste; and the men and women that observe his Law, ought not to controul his actions, neither those of his Prophet, nor say, that they could do better than they, if they would endeavour [it.] He that disobeyeth God and his Prophet, erreth from the right way; Remember what thou didst say to him whom God favoured, to receive him into his Law, and whom thou didst gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie

               <p>IN the Name of God, gracious and merciful. Praised be God, whatsoever is in Heaven, and in the Earth, appertaineth to him; praise is due unto him, he is most Wise and Omniscient: he knoweth whatsoever entreth into the Earth, and cometh out of it, whatsoever ascendeth to Heaven, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendeth, he is gracious and merciful to his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The wicked demand if they shall see the Day of Judgment; say unto them, yes, and that thy Lord knoweth the time; he knoweth what is past, present and future, and all that is in Heaven and in the Earth, even to the weight of an Atome; what is yet less, and what is yet greater than an Atome, is written in a Book that discovereth every thing; he shall reward the True believers that have done good works; he shall give them his Mercy, and enrich them
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:36900:211"/>
with precious treasures: Such as have endeavoured to suppress his Law, shall feel the effects of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. They that understand the Scripture, know that God hath taught thee the very truth, to guide the People into the right way, into the path of honour and vertue; but the wicked said among them, will ye believe a man, who affirmeth, that after your death ye shall rise again, and be new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? He lyeth impudently, he is possessed of the Devil. Certainly they that believe not in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, are in an exceeding great error, and shall suffer most grievous pains; see they not what is above, and what is below them? Consider they not the Heaven and the Earth? If I will, I can ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it barren, and cause a piece of the Heaven to fall upon them for a sign of my Omnipotency. We gave our grace to <hi>David,</hi> and spake to the Mountains, Birds, and Metals with him, to praise me; we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to make Cuirasses, and Iron was soft in his hand, as Wax. O Lineage of <hi>David!</hi> be not ingrateful, I see whatsoever ye do. We made the Winds subject to <hi>Solomon,</hi> he commanded them Evening and Morning, from the East to the West; we gave him a Fountain, and a Brook of dissolved Brass; the Devils, through our permission, wrought it to his mind, and we punished in the Fire of Hell such as refused to obey him. They built for him lofty Palaces, and <note n="*" place="margin">De p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="346" facs="tcp:36900:212"/>
them, they should not have laboured so long a time in his Service. The Inhabitants of <hi>Saba</hi> have a mark of my Omnipotency in their Countrey, <hi>viz.</hi> two Gardens, the one on the North side, and the other towards the South, (it was said unto them) eat of the good things that your Lord hath given you, and return him thanks; their Country is delicious, God hath been merciful towards them, nevertheless they are ingrateful and impious; we sent the River of <hi>Arem</hi> that overflowed their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens; we changed them into two Gardens of Thorns of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and a little <note n="*" place="margin">An <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Date.

                  <hi>Tamarinde;</hi> thus did we punish them, because of their impiety. We established a way with many Cities, for facility of commerce among them, and the City which we blessed, and spake unto the People to follow that way Night and Day with safety, and withou fear: They said, God destroyeth us through the length of this way; they returned to their impiety, and we dispersed them upon the Earth, to serve for example to Posterity, and instruction to such as persevere in my Law, and acknowledg my graces. The Devil caused them to believe his Opinion, they followed him, except some of the True believers that were among them; he had no power over them, but to know them that believed in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, and such as doubt. Thy Lord ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth and regardeth all.

who enricheth you with the good things of Heaven and Earth? They will say that it is God. Say unto them, Who of you, or of us followeth the right way? Or who of you, or of us is seduced? En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire not after our sins, we are not curious to know what ye do, God shall assemble us at the Day of Judgment, and shall judg our differences with equity, he is an exceeding great Judg; say unto them, Let us see the Idols that ye have worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; certainly there is but One God, Omnipotent and Wise. We have not sent thee but to declare to men the joys of Paradise, and to preach to them the pains of Hell, but the greatest part knoweth it not; they ask in what time they shall see the punishment that is preached to them; and if thou speakest the truth; say unto them, when the time thereof is come, ye shall not be able to retard, or advance an hour: They have said, That they will not believe in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> but thou shalt see them one day assembled in the presence of thy Lord, thou shalt see that they shall accuse one another; the Poor shall say unto the Rich, you have hindred us to obey the Commandments of God; they shall answer, have we seduced you from the way that was taught you? On the contrary, you were wicked and malicious: They shall say, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, you employed Night and Day your Artifices to render us ingrateful for the graces of God, and to induce us to believe that he hath Companions equal to him; they shall repent of their sins, when they shall see their punishment; we will lay Chains upon their Necks, and they shall be chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed after their demerits. The chief Inhahitants of the Cities, said to the Prophets that we sent to them to preach the torments of Hell, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not their words. We have (said they) more riches, and more Children than those that believe
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:36900:213"/>
in their discourse; we shall not be damned, as they affirm; say unto them, my Lord giveth and taketh away Riches as seemeth good to him, but the greatest part of the People know it not; your wealth and your children shall not give you access to God; such as shall perform good works, shall be rewarded, and shall live eternally in the delights of Paradise; they that shall endeavour to suppress our Law, shall be cast headlong into the Fire of Hell: Say unto them, My Lord giveth, and taketh away Wealth as to him seemeth good; he maketh vain the alms which ye shall give, if ye observe not his Law; he is the Rich of the Rich: Be thou mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the day, when I shall assemble the Idolaters, and shall say to the Angels, Behold them who have adored you; they shall say, praised be God, thou alone art our master and protector; they ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not us, they worshipped the Devil; the greatest part of them believed in his word, this day they are not able to benefit, or hurt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they will say to the unjust, taste the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell Fire, which ye would not believe. They said when thou didst preach unto them our Commandments, this man would hinder us to worship the gods of our fathers, he is a Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. They have said, That the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is but Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery and Magick, and read not the books that we have sent unto them. Their predecessors did like them; they traduced our Apostles, and hindred them to preach the tenth part of what we had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired into them; they traduced them, but how were they chastised? Say unto them, I preach to you to pray to God two by two, or alone, or in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; ye shall know one day, that your friend <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> is not possessed of the Devil, and that he preacheth to you the pains of Hell; I require no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of you for mine exhortations, God shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:36900:213"/>
me, he seeth all. Say unto them, God teacheth his Prophet the Truth, and what is to come; the truth appeared, and falshood was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and the lyars were deprived of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; if I wilfully go astray, or if I act what God hath enjoyned me, this shall be for my Soul, God heareth, and is present at all things. Thou shalt see the Infidels filled with fear, and affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when they shall come out of their sepulchres; they shall not escape the punishment of their incredulity; they shall then say, That they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> but I will shew to them from far the Law which they have despised in the World; they shall be precipitated with their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, into a place remote from mercy and pardon. They shall be separated from the True believers, because they have doubted the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the Law of God.</p>

They who devoutly read the Book of God, who make their prayers at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and bestow in pious works, secretly or publickly, part of the wealth that we have given them, have hope of a recompence that shall never perish; God shall recompence and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his graces upon them; he is merciful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the good, and accepteth the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his graces. The Book that we have sent thee containeth the Truth, it confirmeth the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Scriptures, God knoweth and seeth all things. We have given the understanding of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> to such as we have chosen among our creatures; there be some who have ill discharged what we have taught them; some have perfrom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what was enjoyned them, and others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have

taught it with affection and diligence through Gods permission. This is a great grace, they shall enter into the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> where they shall remain eternally; they shall be adorned with Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of Gold, enriched with precious stones, they shall be cloathed with fine silk, and shall say, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be God, who hath delivered us from afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he is most merciful, and accepteth the thanks of his creatures; such as through his special grace shall enjoy the house of eternity, shall be free from all pain, and the Infidels shall be cast headlong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire of Hell. They shall not die in those tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and their torture shall never be asswaged; thus shall the wicked be chastised, they shall in vain implore succour of God, and say, Lord deliver us from these pains, we will do better than we have done heretofore; I will no more prolong your life on Earth, I have sent you my Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, They preached unto you my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, you would not hear them, taste now the pains of Hell, which ye have merited, the wicked shall this day be deprived of protection.

wicked swore to fight for the encrease of the faith, if there should come to them a Preacher to instruct them; and when he came, they augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their wickedness, became proud in the Earth, and conspired against the true believers; their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy fell upon themselves, and they can expect none other things than what was ordained against their predecessors, the Law of God admitteth none alteration. Consider they not what was the end of their Predecessors? who were more wealthy and powerful than they? Nothing is impossible to God, he knoweth all things, and is omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Should God punish the people when they offend him, he should leave no living creature on the Earth, he deferreth the chastisement of the wicked until the time appointed; when their time shall be come, he will punish them according to their demerits, he seeth all.</p>

right way. This Book was sent by the Omnipotent and merciful, that thou maist instruct men in that which was not taught their Predecessors: Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what was said is true, <hi>viz.</hi> That the greatest part of them is incredulous; We will put a chain upon their neck, and bind their hands to the very chin; they shall lift up the head to complain, but we will place before and behind them a great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle, we will cover their sight with darkness, and they shall not see a jot. Misery is upon them; whether thou dost reprove, or not reprove them, they shall not be converted. If thou preachest to them that believe in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and to such as believe in what they have seen, proclaim to them a general pardon of their sins, and a very great reward.

They said, certainly God knoweth that he sent us to you; we are obliged only to preach to you his Commandments; They answered, would ye make us Infidels like your selves? If ye end not this discourse, we will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Certainly you are wicked: Then a man came running from the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most part of the City, who said unto them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Oh people! obey the Apostles of God, obey them that require no reward from you for the pains
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:36900:217"/>
which they take in teaching you, and who are in the right way. Wherefore shall not I worship him that created me, and before whom ye all shall be assembled to be judged? Will ye worship ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beside him? If it be his will to chastise me, your Idols cannot save me, I should be extremely erroneous, should I believe in your Gods; hear and understand what I say unto you. [Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they slew him] and said unto him, Go, enter into Paradise; He said, in dying, would to God this people knew the graces that his Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty hath conferred on me, he placed me in the number of the blessed: After his death we did not send Angels from Heaven to chastise the wicked; I will send them but once to destroy them; they shall one day be dumb, for shame that they have not followed the True-believers, and of being mocked by them that I sent to preach unto them my Commandments: Will they not consider how much people we have destroyed in times past, who are not returned, and that shall be one day assembled before me to be judged? The Earth, dry, dead, and barren, as a sign of my omnipotency for the wicked; we made it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, and become green again, and to bring forth fruits, with which they were satiate; we there created Gardens, Date-trees, and Vines, we cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Fountains to flow; they eat of the fruits which are not the works of their hands; will they not acknowledg the works of their Lord? Praise is due to him that created the male and the female of all Plants that the Earth produceth, who created man and woman, and many other things, of which they have no knowledg. It is a sign of my omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, to separate the day from the night, and to make the Sun to run to his appointed place. We have appointed to the Moon her Signs, she
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:36900:217"/>
goeth and cometh always through her old way; the Sun neither hastneth, nor retardeth his course at any time, neither doth joyn himself by night to the Moon; the night cometh not until the end of the day. And all, to wit, the Moon, the Sun, and the Stars exalt my glory in the Heaven: It is a mark of mine omnipotency, to have born their fathers upon the waters in the Ark, and to have given them vessels like the Ark to bear them; had it pleased me, I had caused them to be drowned, without succor and salvation; I saved them through my special grace, until the time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The wicked despise the signs of Gods omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, and scoffed, when they were required to fear the wrath of his Divine Majesty, present, and to come, and that their iniquities shall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given them. When it was said unto them, Give alms of the wealth that God hath given you, they answered, shall I give him to eat, to whom God shall give bread when it shall please him? They are in a very great error. They will enquire of you when the day of Judgment shall be; and if ye believe it, tell them that they must expect but one sole voice, that shall surprize them, they shall quarrel, they shall not be able to make their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, neither return to see their Parents; in the end they shall go out of their Sepulchres, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent themselves before God, when the Trumpet shall sound: Then shall they say, we are most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, to have departed from our graves, behold what God hath promised us! The Prophets spake to us the Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> That the world ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect but one voice: This day shall all men be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled before their Lord, no injustice shall be done to any person, and every one shall be rewarded, and chastised after his works: Such as shall go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Paradise, shall be in exceeding great repose, with
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:36900:218"/>
all manner of contentment, they and their wives shall be safe from all evils, lying on delicious beds, they shall have all sorts of fruits, and whatsoever they shall desire, they shall be saluted on the behalf of the Lord, gracious and merciful. God shall say to the wicked at the day of Judgment, Depart ye this day from the company of the good; did I not forbid you to worship the Devil, your open enemy, but to worship me alone, and that it was the right way? Did I not tell you that the Devil seduced a multitude of the people? Ye would not believe it, behold Hell, that is prepared for you, through your incredulity. I will shut their mouth, their hand shall speak, and their feet shall be witnesses of their crimes: If we will, we can make the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels blind, they shall find no way, they shall not be able to go or come, and shall be succoured of none; had it been our pleasure we could have transformed them in their houses, and they had not been able to go forth; I will cast their head against the ground, and will render them infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, whose life I shall prolong, and they shall not know their errors. We have not made them to understand the Mysteries of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> but that was not necessary; it is but to preach to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, who comprehend what is spoken to them; it is most true, that the wicked shall be punished: See they not that we alone have created all the Beasts of the Earth, over which they command? We have made them subject to them: Some serve them to ride on, and others for their nourishment, will they be ingrateful? Nevertheless they have worshipped Idols, they adored what could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them from the pains of Hell. Afflict not thy self at their discourse, I know whatsoever they say, and all that they keep secret in their souls: Doth not man consider <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 words">

Say unto them, he it is that created you at first, and that knoweth what he created; he maketh fire to come out of the green woods which ye burn, and created the Heaven and the Earth; cannot he create other creatures like unto you? Yes, without doubt, he createth what pleaseth him, he knoweth all things; when he willeth any thing, he saith, Be thou, and it is; praised be he, to whom all things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain, and before whom you all shall return [to be judged.]</p>

We adorned the Heaven and the Earth with Planets, and have kept them safe from the malice of the Devils; they cannot hear what is spoken in the Firmament, they are shamefully driven away on all sides, and shall be eternally tormented; if they hear any thing spoken, they hear it greedly, and follow

[it] speedily, but the shining Planet pursueth them, [and detecteth their malice.] The wicked have demanded if we created any thing more illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than they: Certainly we created them all of the dust of the Earth: Thou art amazed at their blasphemies, they deride thy amazement, and shall never be converted. When they shall see Miracles, they shall scoff, and say, that it is but evident Magick to believe that they shall dye, and after, being earth, bones, and dust, they shall rise again with their fathers and predecessors: Say unto them, that they shall rise again, and that they are seduced from the right way; that the world shall be but once destroyed, and they shall see what will befall them at the day of Judgment: They shall that day say, they are wretched, and the Angel shall say unto them, behold the day of Judgment, behold the day that the godly shall be separated from the wicked; behold the day which ye would not believe: It shall be said to the Angels, gather them together, assemble their wives, and their Idols, put them into the way of Hell, and stay them, to give account of their deportments, and why their Idols do not succour them. Certainly they shall desire to be in the number of them that have obeyed Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments: They shall quarrel among them, and shall say, it is you that have seduced us from the right way, through your Oaths; ye swore that ye followed the Law of God, and observed his Commandments: They shall answer on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, We have no power over you, you your selves were in manifest error, the word of God shall be accomplished against us, and we shall for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany suffer the tormens of Hell; if we seduced you, we were likewise seduced, and we shall this day be your companions in punishment. That day

On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he teacheth you the truth, as did the Prophets that were before him; ye shall be chastised, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated according to your demerits. Such as shall obey Gods Commandments, shall have a place of safety wherein to rest, with all sorts of fruits, in pleasant gardens, sitting orderly on delicious beds, with glasses full of a drink, pleasing to the taste, which shall not make them drunk. Their wives white as fresh Eggs, shall not cast an eye upon any but upon them; they shall talk together, and one among them shall say, I had on earth a compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who asked me if I believed in the Resurrection; and if after being reduced to earth, bones, and dust, we shall rise again? come with me, let us go see what he doth; he shall see him in the bottom of Hell, and shall say unto him, by God, it wanted little but that thou hadst seduced me, without the grace of God I had been damned, as thou art, we are not in the number of the dead, we shall not suffer any pain; on the contrary, we are in excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great happiness; thus are the righteous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded; who are the more happy? they who are in our felicity, or such as are near to <hi>Zacon,</hi> the tree of hell? This tree cometh out of the bottom of hell, it riseth high, and the branches themselves resemble the heads of Devils; the damned shall eat of the fruit thereof, they shall drink boiling water, and Hell shall be the place of their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; their fathers were Infidels, they followed their footsteps, and the way of them that were seduced before them; we sent unto them Preachers, whom they refused to hear, but consider what is the end of the righteous, and that of the wicked. We saved
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:36900:220"/>
                  <hi>Noah,</hi> and gave grace to such as obeyed him; we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him with his family from a great danger, and perpetuated his progeny; he shall be praised of all them that shall come after him, because we gave him our blessing; thus do I recompence the righteous, he was in the number of them that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed my Commandments; we saved him, and them that followed him, and drowned the Infidels. Remember <hi>Abraham,</hi> God gave him an heart free from impiety and malice; he said to his father and his people, wherefore worship ye false gods instead of the true God? think ye to escape the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your crimes? Then he had a vision in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and said, I am sick of your Idolatry, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from him with purpose to be converted, and empty the Temples of Idols of their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; he said to the Idols, wherefore eat ye not the sacrifices that are before you? wherefore speak ye not? and gave them a great blow with his right hand: the people came together with wrath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had stricken their gods; he said unto them, Will ye worship the works of your hands? know ye not that it is God that created you? Then they said among them, let us build a great pile, and put fire to it, and cast <hi>Abraham</hi> into the fire; they conspired against him, but we rendred them asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and confounded. <hi>Abraham</hi> said unto them, I go towards my Lord, he shall guide me into the way of salvation; Lord, give me a son that may be in the number of the righteous; we declared to him that he should have a son, exceeding wise, when he arrived to years of discretion; he said unto him, my son, I dreamed this night that I must sacrifice thee, what wilt thou that I do? He replied, my father, do what is commanded you, ye shall find me full of patience; when his father laid him on the ground, and put the knife nigh unto his throat; we said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:36900:220"/>
him, O <hi>Abraham!</hi> it is enough, thou hast satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thy dream; thus do I intreat the righteous, thus were we wont to prove them. We redeemed his son with a fair Ram; he shall be praised of posterity, and those that shall come after him, shall bless his memory. Thus do I reward the righteous, he was in the number of them that obey my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. We declared to him that he should have a son called <hi>Isaac,</hi> from whom should issue many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and unbelievers. Certainly we gave our grace to <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> we delivered them with their followers from an evident peril, we protected them, and they were in the number of the victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; we gave them the Book full of light, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them into the right way; they shall be praised in ages to come, and posterity shall bless their memory. Thus do I recompence the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, they were in the number of them that obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Commandments: <hi>Elias</hi> is in the number of my Prophets and Apostles; he said unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, wherefore fear ye not God? wherefore wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship ye the Idol <hi>Balan,</hi> and forsake the Creator of the world? God is your Lord, and the Lord of your predecessors; they traduced him, and were condemned to the fire of hell, except such among them as obeyed my Commandments. We left his memory happy to posterity; thus I reward the righteous; he was in the number of them that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed my Commandments. <hi>Lot</hi> was in the number of my Prophets and Apostles: Remember thou, how we delivered him and his family from evident peril, except his wife, who remained among them that were chastised; having saved him, we destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the wicked; they saw in the morning the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of the ruin that befell them the night before; will ye not understand this miracle? <hi>Ionas</hi> was in the number of the Prophets. Remember thou, that
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:36900:221"/>
he fled in a Ship, and was the cause of evil to the Sailors, he was swallowed of a Whale; had he not repented of his fault, he should have continued in the belly of that Fish until the day of Judgment; we cast him on the shore extremely feeble, we co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him with leaves of Filbert, and sent him to preach to more than an hundred thousand persons, that we reconverted, whose decease we deferred until the time appointed. The Infidels have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded if thy Lord hath daughters, as they have sons? did we create the Angels male and female in their presence? They lye, when they say, that God hath a son; hath he desired to have daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters rather than sons? how can you thus blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme? Consider ye not that he is God alone, without children? have ye any reason or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to speak in this manner? bring your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, produce your reason, if ye are true. The Infidels have said, that the Angels were of the lineage of God, but the Angels well know that the Infidels shall be damned, because of their blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies. Praised be God, he hath neither son nor daughter, other than the righteous that worship him, and obey his Commandments. You, with your Idols cannot escape the punishment of your sins, ye shall be condemned to the fire of hell. There is none among the Angels that knoweth not his place, and his order in Paradise, to praise and worship his Divine Majesty. If the Infidels say, we observe the Religion of our Predecessors, we are in the right way; Say unto them, that if they believe not in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> they shall in fine know their incredulity. We have promised prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to believers, and Prophets, they shall be protected and victorious; depart for a time from the wicked, consider how God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth them, they shall feel the punishment
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:36900:221"/>
of their impiety; will they cast themselves head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the torments of hell? assuredly they will be astonished when they shall feel them; depart from their company, and consider that they shall not be able to escape the punishment of their crimes. Praise thy Lord, the Lord of power and greatness, above the wicked; salvation be to the Prophets, and eternal praise to the God of the Universe.</p>

See the <hi>Gloss</hi> of <hi>Gelaldin, Kitab el tenoir.</hi> They have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled it the Chapter of Truth.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the name of God, gracious and merciful. I swear by the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> that this Book teacheth the way of Salvation; nevertheless, the Infidels re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the Faith, and are among themselves of a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent opinion. How many have we destroyed in times past, that were like unto them? They cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and required succors, but they were no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be succored. The Infidels wonder, that a man like themselves should be sent to instruct them: they say, That he is a Magician, and a lyar, to preach one sole God. It is a strange thing! Their Doctors forsook their Assemblies, they went to preach through the City, and said, Persist to adore
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:36900:222"/>
your Gods; we abjure the belief of the unity of God, the last Sect did not preach it; it is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent lye. Was <hi>Mahomet</hi> chosen among us to receive alone the <hi>Alcoran</hi> descended from Heaven? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they doubt the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> they shall know the truth, when they shall be in the fire of Hell. Have they in their power the Treasures of the mercy of thy Lord, omnipotent and bountiful? Possess they the Kingdom of the Heavens and Earth, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is betwixt them? If it be so, let them as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend into Heaven with their forces; assuredly, they shall be shamefully beaten in all places. The wicked heretofore defamed <hi>Noah, Aad, Pharoah,</hi> the maker of <hi>Charmes</hi> and <hi>Temod,</hi> the Inhabitants of the City of <hi>Lot;</hi> those that dwelt in the Forest, and their companions, traduced the Prophets, and were punished after their demerits; nevertheless, the Infidels consider not that they shall be chastised, when the trumpet shall sound at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that they shall no more return on earth to be converted. They say in scorn, Lord give us to see the Book of the Accompt of our sins, before the day of Judgment. Persevere, and be patient, be not troubled at their discourse, and call to mind our servant <hi>David,</hi> stout and zealous in my Law; the Mountains and the Birds praised me with him; they assembled in his presence, and obeyed him; we gave force to his reign, and endued him with knowledg and eloquence. Hast thou learnt <hi>Davids</hi> quarrel, when they hindred him to enter into the Temple? and how he feared his enemies? When they entred towards him, they said unto him, Be not afraid, we have a dispute among us, judg our difference with equity, and teach us the right way. This man is my brother, he hath fourscore and nineteen sheep: I had but one, which he hath ravished from me, because he was stronger than I.
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:36900:222"/>
                  <hi>David</hi> said, He hath done thee wrong, art thou troubled for one Ew? The greatest part of men arose against their neighbour, except such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Law of God, and observe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, which are few in number. Then <hi>David</hi> knew that we had tried him, he implored pardon of his sin, he humbled himself, worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped us, and was converted. We gave him pardon of his fault, we drew him near unto us, and lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in a place of content. I said unto him, O <hi>David!</hi> we have established thee on Earth, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the differences that shall arise among the people, follow not thine own appetite, it will se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thee from the way of Salvation; such as shall err from my Law, shall suffer grievous pains at the day of Judgment. We have not in vain created the Heaven, and the Earth, as the wicked affirm; misery shall befal them, they shall be cast headlong and burnt in the fire of Hell. Shall I alike entreat the believers, and unbelievers? the righteous and the wicked? This Book! we have sent it to thee, and blessed it, to the end the people may medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the mysteries thereof; and the wise reap ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for their salvation. We gave <hi>Solomon</hi> to our servant <hi>David,</hi> he was extreamly zealous in our service. Remember that horses, ready and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, were presented to him about evening; that he forgot to make his prayer at the hour of Vespers; and said, What? Have I preferred the love of the wealth of the Earth, to the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of God, even until the Sunset? He caused them to be led back again, and sacrificed some of them (for expiation of his fault.) He caused their legs and necks to be cut off. We tried <hi>Solomon,</hi> we<note place="margin">See <hi>Tefsir anf Ioahir</hi> in <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish.</hi>

a reign, that the like hath not been seen; thou art liberal towards thy creatures. We made sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to him the winds, which blowed at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, where it pleased him. We made the Devils subject to him; some built his Palaces, others di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the Seas to bring him Pearls, and others were bound and chained to attend his commands; he retained and dismissed whom he listed, with rendring an accompt. We drew him near unto us, and lodged him in a place of content. Remember our servant <hi>Iob,</hi> that he prayed to his Lord, and said, That the Devil had heaped misery and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon him. It was said unto him, Strike the Earth with thy foot; thou shalt see water spring forth to wash thee, and to drink: We restored to him his children, and his riches, through our spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial grace, to be an example to posterity. It was said unto him, when his wife would have made him to murmur, Take rods in thine hand, strike thy wife, and swerve not from what thou hast promised. We found him patient, and zealous in obedience to our Commandments. Remember our servant <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Iacob,</hi> affectionate and zealous in our Law; we saved, and chose them among the righteous. Such as have my fear before their eyes, shall enjoy the delights of the Garden of <hi>Eden;</hi> where they shall repose upon most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous beds; they shall there have all sorts of fruits, and delicious drink; and their wives shall not look on any but on them. Behold, what is promised to them at the day of Judgment, and these pleasures shall never end. The wicked and Infidels shall be precipitated into the fire of Hell, they shall drink boiling water in abundance, and water extreamly cold, full of all manner of noysom smells; they shall be precipitated into the flames, and shall say to them that have obeyed them upon Earth, May

ye be perpetually tormented, you have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and mis-led us. On the contrary, may yout selves be tormented, you have been the cause of our misery, and shall be damned with us. Then shall they say, Lord encrease the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of him that is the cause of our misery: Shall we not be able to see them whom we belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on Earth to be Infidels, and whom we deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? cannot our eyes see? Thus shall the damned quarrel. Say (to the people) I am sent only to preach unto you the Unity of God, the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Creator of Heaven and Earth, and of all that is between them. Behold, the best Sermon that I can make unto you; nevertheless you despise it. I know not what happened in Heaven when the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels quarrelled. God hath inspired it into me, and I am sent but to instruct you, and to preach publikely the pains of Hell. Remember thou that God said to his Angels, I will create man of the mire of the Earth; when I have formed him, I will breathe against him, and inspire my Spirit into his body; prostrate your selves before him with humility. The Angels there prostrated themselves, except the Devil; he was proud, and already in the number of the wicked. Thy Lord said unto him. Wherefore dost thou not humble thy self before the work of my hands? Thou art in the number of the proud; he replied, I am better than man, thou hast made me of fire, and hast created him of the dust of the Earth. Then thy Lord said unto him, Get thee hence, thou shalt be chastised on all sides, and my curse be upon thee until the day of Judgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He answered, Lord, defer my punishment until the day of the Resurrection; he said, I will defer it until the day appointed. He repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, through thy permission I will tempt all the world, except such as shall be zealous in thy Law,

Are such as labour, to be compared to them that are idle? They that have judgment will understand this discourse. Say unto them oh ye people that believe in your Lord! have his fear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your eyes; such as shall do good works in this world, shall enjoy abundantly the riches of the earth, God will innumerably reward them that persevere in obedience to his Commandments. Say unto them, I am commanded to worship one God, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess his Unity, and to be obedient to him. Say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, I apprehend the day of Judgment, if I disobey God my Lord. Say unto them, I will worship but one God; worship ye others, whom
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:36900:225"/>
ye will. Such as shall despise the Law of God, shall lose their souls, and families, at the day of Judgment. These are two great losses, and most certain they be involved in eternal fire. Thus God preacheth to true believers. O my creature! speak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that have my fear before their eyes, that they adore not Idols, and that if they turn to their Lord, they shall enjoy the delights of Paradise. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim to them that hear my Word, and obey my Commandments, that they are in the right way, and well advised; canst thou deliver from the fire of hell him that shall be condemned? Certainly such as obey God, shall enjoy the pleasures of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, wherein flow many rivers, and there shall they dwell eternally. This is the promise of God, he swerveth not from that which he promiseth. Seest thou not that God sendeth rain from heaven, and maketh the rivers to run upon the earth, he causeth plants to spring forth, and herbs of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers colours; thou seest them become yellow, and then altogether drie; this is a sign of his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency. Hath not he to whom God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the light of faith, received a great grace from his divine Majesty? Misery is upon them that have an heart hardned, and forget his Law; they are manifestly seduced; he hath sent an excellent book for the instruction of men, his precepts are alike in purity, and without contradiction: They that fear God, tremble when they hear mention of this book, and find their rest in the word of his divine Majesty. This book is the guide of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, God by it guideth whom pleaseth him. He whom God shall seduce, shall find none to guide him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he shall be precipitated into the fire of hell at the day of Judgment. It shall be said that day to the wicked, taste the torments that ye have merited; their predecessors defamed the
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:36900:225"/>
Prophets, and were punished when they least thought of it; God rendred them ignominious in this world, and they shall feel in the other, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments much more grievous, and they know it not. We have taught in this book what is necessary for the salvation of the people, peradventure they will learn it; it is in the Arabique tongue, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out falshood and contradiction, perhaps the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will fly from impiety; God teacheth you a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: Two men are associates in their traffique, the one is wicked, the other an honest man, are they alike? Praise is due to one sole God; the greatest part of the Infidels understand it not. Thou shalt die, all men shall die, and ye shall be assembled at the day of Judgment, when ye shall dispute together; Who is more unjust, than he that blasphemeth against God, and against the known truth? Shall not the wicked be damned? Such as shall believe the Prophet, and fly impiety, shall obtain from God what they desire; such is the recompence of the righteous, God shall pardon their sins, and reward them for their good works: doth not he protect his servant? They will ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie thee with the Idols which they adore; but he whom God shall mislead, shall find none able to guide him, and none shall be able to seduce him whom he shall guide; is not he the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and revenging? If thou ask of the Infidels, who created heaven and earth? they will say it is God; Say unto them, have ye therefore conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Idols which ye adore, can they exempt you from the wrath of God, when it shall be his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to chastise you? Shall they be able to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his grace, when it shall be his will to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don you? Say unto them, my refuge is God, I am resigned to his Will, the wise trust in his divine Majesty. Say unto them, oh people! do
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:36900:226"/>
as you understand him. I will do as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand him; ye shall know in the end, that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever shall be condemned, shall be ashamed, and be precipitated into eternall torments. We have sent unto thee the most true Book, to instruct the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; He that shall follow the right way, shall meet with nothing but good; and he that shall go astray, shall meet with nothing but evill; thou art not the guardian of the wicked; God causeth men to die when the hour of their death is arrived; he deferreth the death of many during their sleep, and remitteth that of others to the time appointed, this is a sign of his Omnipotencie, to such as consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. Will ye worship any but God? Say unto them, how shall your Idols be able to intercede for you, since they want power? know you not this? Say unto them, we ought to invoke one God alone, King of the heaven and earth; you all shall one day be assembled before him to be judged. The Infidels tremble with fear, when they hear mention of one sole God, and rejoyce, when they hear speak of their Idols; Say unto them, God is Creator of the heavens and the earth, he knoweth the past, present, and future; (Lord!) thou shalt one day judge the differences of thy creatures: Should the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels possess all the riches of the earth, and yet as much more, they would not be able to escape the fire of hell at the day of Judgment; they shall be punished more grievously than they imagine, their sins shall be set before them, and they shall feel the rigors of the torments which they despise. Man calleth upon us when he is in affliction, and when we give him our grace, he saith, he meriteth it; on the contrary, this is to prove him, but most of them are ignorant of it; their predecessors spake as they; the good that they have done, hath profited them nothing: and the misery
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:36900:226"/>
that they have merited, is faln upon them, they shall not escape the punishment of their crimes. Know they not that God giveth and taketh away wealth from whom pleaseth him? This is a sign of his omnipotency for the righteous. Say unto them, oh people! they who have offended God, ought not to despair of his grace, he is gracious and merciful; be ye converted, and recommend your selves to his will before ye be condemned, otherwise ye shall remain without protection; follow the instruction that God hath sent to you, before ye be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the punishment of your crimes shall surprise you, ye know not the time; the wicked shall be afflicted, for that they have not obeyed Gods Commandments, they shall know their damnation, and the sin that they have committed, in scorning the true believers: They shall say, had God guided me into the right way, I had had his fear before mine eyes. When they shall see hell, they shall say, could I return into the world, I would be in the number of the righteous; on the contrary, my Commandments were taught you, but ye became proud, and despised them. Thou shalt see that day how the visages of Infidels shall be blackned: is there not a place in hell prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the proud? God loveth, and putteth into a place of felicitie them that fear him, they shall not be touched, either with displeasure or affliction; God hath created all things, and disposeth all at his pleasure; he hath in his power the keyes of heaven and earth, such as disobey him are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Say unto them, oh ignorant [men] will ye enjoyn me to worship another god, besides God? It hath been preached to you, and your predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, that all your good works shall be unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, if ye adore many gods, and that you shall be in the number of the damned: there is but
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:36900:227"/>
one God, worship him, and be mindful of his graces. The Infidels have not praised God as he ought to be praised, they have no knowledg of his power, he shall make the earth to tremble, and gather together the heavens by rhe strength of his right hand at the day of Judgment; praised be God, he hath no companion. When the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet shall sound the first time, he shall cause to die, whom he will have to die in the heavens and earth; the second time all the world shall rise again and attend his Commandments; the earth shall be full of the light of the Lord thereof; he shall bring his book, wherein shall be written what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Martyrs have taught, he shall judge the world with equity, and shall not do injustice to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; every one shall be rewarded and chastised for his works, he knoweth all that they have done, he shall send the Infidels into the fire of hell, in troops; when they shall be arrived at the gate, it shall open before their eyes; it shall be said unto them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Hell, which ye have merited; were there not Prophets and Apostles, to teach you the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and to preach unto you on Earth the coming of this rigorous day? They shall say, yes, but the word of God, shall be accomplished against the wicked. It shall be said unto them, go, enter into Hell, ye shall abide there eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is the habitation of the proud. Such as shall have the fear of God before their eyes, shall be conducted in troops to the gate of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, the gate shall open before their eyes; it shall be said unto them, behold what ye have gained, the peace of God is with you, ye have not been ignorant, enter into Paradise, ye shall dwell therein eternally. They shall say, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be God, for that we believed in his Law; and because we are heirs of his grace, we
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:36900:227"/>
will go into Paradise, into what place shall seem good to us, God giveth his blessing to the righteous. Thou shalt see the Angels about the Throne of thy Lord, who shall praise and exalt his glory; they shall say, God hath judged his creatures with equity, praise is due to the Lord of the Universe.</p>

               <p>IN the Name of God, Gracious and Merciful: God is prudent and wise. This Book is sent by the Omnipotent, who knoweth all things, who par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth sins, and accepteth the conversion of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he is severe in his chastisements, and indulgent to his People, there is no God but he, and all the World shall one day be assembled before his Divine Majesty [to be judged.] No man disputeth against the Precepts of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> but the wicked; be not thou discontented if they live on Earth with some felicity; the People of <hi>Noah</hi>'s time contemned his instructions, their Posterity did like them, and every Nation hath conspired the death of them whom God sent to instruct them; they disputed to obscure the truth through their lyes, but they were punished; and after what manner? So is the Word of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished against the wicked, they all shall be
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:36900:228"/>
damned. The Angels that are about the Throne of God, and those that bear him, praise and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt his Divine Majesty, they believe in his Unity, and beg pardon of him for the True believers; Lord, thy mercy extendeth through the whole World, nothing is hid from thee, either in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Earth, pardon their sins that convert, and embrace thy holy Law; deliver them from the Fire of Hell, open to them the gate of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of <hi>Eden,</hi> which thou hast prepared for them, their Fathers, Wives, and Children, and them of their Lineage that shall do good works, thou art Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent and wise. Depart from sin, he that shall depart [from it] shall resent the effect of God's mercy at the Day of Judgment, and shall enjoy eternal felicity; the Infidels shall be hated of God, his hatred is infinitely more dangerous than yours; will ye be Infidels after being called to the observation of the Law of Salvation? They said, Lord, wilt thou cause us to die twice? And shall we twice rise again? But they shall say at the day of Judgment, Lord, we confess we have offended thee, we acknowledg our sin, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving renounced the belief of thine Unity; shall we never go out of Hell, to observe thy Law, and follow the way of Salvation? No, ye shall suffer in the Fire of Hell, because that ye have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved them that adored Idols, and because ye have said, that God hath companions equal to him. All things obey one sole God Omnipotent, he it is that made you to see his Miracles, and sendeth you the riches of Heaven and Earth; none consider it, but such as are converted. Pray to God, and observe his Law, although it be against the will of the wicked; he elevateth his Creatures to what degree he listeth, he hath created his Throne, and sent his inspirations to whom he seeth
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:36900:228"/>
good, to preach the Day of Judgment; that Day shall the People come out of their Monuments, and none shall be able to hide himself from his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majesty. Who shall command that day? It shall be God alone, victorious; that day shall he recompence every one after his works without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice, he is exact to make account. If thou preach to the wicked the Day of Judgment, their heart will lift them up, and they shall be full of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, their prayers shall not be heard, and none shall intercede for them: God knoweth them that have eyes of treachery, and seeth all that is in the hearts of men, he judgeth of every thing with truth; the Idols which they worship are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out power, God alone understandeth all things, and is Omnipotent. Consider they not what was the end of their predecessors? Who were more powerful, and more wealthy than they? God sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised them in their sins, there was none of power to save them, for that they despised the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of his Divine Majesty, they contemned his Law, and were impious; but he severely chastised them, he is Omnipotent, and most severe. We sent <hi>Moses</hi> with Miracles, with Reasons clear and intelligible to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to <hi>Haman,</hi> and <hi>Caron;</hi> they said that <hi>Moses</hi> was a Sorcerer, and a lyar; and when he preached to them the truth on our behalf, they said, kill him, with all those that believe him, and make their wives infamous; but their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy was but impiety: <hi>Pharaoh</hi> said, hinder me not to kill <hi>Moses,</hi> let him invoke his God to save him; I fear that he may alter your Law, and introduce some disorder in the Land; <hi>Moses</hi> said, God, mine and your Lord, shall defend me from the malice of the proud, that believe not the Day of Judgment: Then a man of the dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiques of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that secretly professed the true
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:36900:229"/>
Law, said, will ye slay a man that declareth that God is his Lord? And that hath made you to see Miracles? If he be a Lyar, his lye shall be against him; but if he speak the truth, something of what he hath preached shall befal you. God guideth neither the wicked nor lyars. Oh Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple! you this day command on Earth with splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor; who shall defend us from the wrath of God, if it fall upon us? <hi>Pharaoh</hi> said, I speak nothing to you, but what I have told you heretofore, and I will guide you all into the right way; he of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestiques, that secretly professed the true Law, said, Oh people! I fear lest ye be chastised, as have been your predecessors, as were the people of <hi>Noah, Aad, Temod,</hi> and those that were after them; God will not do injustice to men, I fear for you the Day of Judgment, a day, when ye shall rise again with terror, to render account of your actions; he whom God shall seduce shall find none to guide him. Certainly <hi>Ioseph</hi> came heretofore with instructions, clear and intelligible: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless ye doubted, even until his death, and said, that after him God shall not send a Prophet like unto him; thus doth God seduce the wicked, that doubt of his Law; he hateth such as dispute without reason, they are abhorred of them that believe in his Divine Majesty; thus God hardneth the heart of the proud, and Tyrants. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> said to * <hi>Haman,</hi> build me an high Palace, peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<note place="margin">

                  </note> I shall arrive at the Heavens, and as high as the God of <hi>Moses,</hi> I believe him to be a Lyar. Thus <hi>Pharaoh</hi> delighted in his wicked actions, he erred from the right way, and his conspiracy was but his destruction. He of his Family that was a True believer, said, Oh people! follow me, I will guide you into the right way, the riches of the Earth pass away lightly, and the riches
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:36900:229"/>
of Heaven are Eternal; he that doth evil shall find evil; who doth good, man or woman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in God, shall enter into Paradise, where he shall be enriched innumerably with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of riches. Wherefore invite you me to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate my self into the Fire of Hell, since I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you to your Salvation? Ye invite me to be wicked, and to believe that God hath companions, and I know it is not so; I call you to the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and merciful [God] doubtless I will not worship your Idols, they cannot hear you, either in this World, or in the other; we all shall be one day assembled before God, who will condemn Infidels to the Fire of Hell; consider hereafter what to you I have preached; I am resigned to the will of God, he beholdeth all the actions of his creatures; he shall chastise them for the evil that they shall commit, and for their wicked designs. He sent his punishment upon the Lineage of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> they deserved to be precipitated into the Fire of Hell, they shall burn Evening and Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It shall be said to them at the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, oh People of <hi>Pharaoh!</hi> go, enter into the Fire of Hell. The Infidels shall quarrel in Hell, the poor shall say unto the rich; We followed you, are ye able this day to deliver us from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal flames? They shall answer, we all are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with you, God is a most just Judg. The damned shall say to the Ministers of Hell, Pray to your Lord, that he may asswage these tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for one day; they shall answer, had ye not on Earth the Prophets and Apostles of God to instruct you? They shall say, Yes; pray therefore to God your selves; the wicked love nothing but impiety; I will protect on Earth my Prophets, and them that observe my Law, and particularly at the Day of Judgment; that day the wicked
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:36900:230"/>
shall have no excuse that shall advantage them, my curse shall fall upon them, and they all shall be damned. We taught <hi>Moses</hi> the way of Salvation, and made the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> heirs of his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, to instruct them that shall understand them. Persevere and be patient, the promise of God is infallible; implore pardon of thy sins, and exalt the praise of thy Lord Evening and Morning. They that dispute against the Commandments of God are without reason, and have nought in their Souls but pride and ignorance: Implore suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor of God, he understandeth and seeth all things, the Creation of the Heavens, and of the Earth, is greater than the Creation of men, but the greatest part of men know it not; the Blind is not like to him that seeth clearly; he that doth good, is not like to him that doth evil, neither is obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity such as the light, but few men consider it. Doubtless the Day of Judgment shall come, nevertheless the greatest part of men will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it: Your Lord hath said, Call upon me, I will hear you; such as shall resist my Law, shall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>go into Hell, and be Eternally seduced. God hath created the Night for repose, and the day for travel, he is bountiful towards his creatures, but the greatest part of the people are ingrateful; God is your Lord, Creator of all things, there is no God but he. How can the wicked Blaspheme? So do they blaspheme that are ingrateful for the graces of God; he hath established you on Earth, he hath covered you with the Heavens, he hath formed you, enriched you; he is your God, your Lord, blessed be God, Lord of the Universe, he it is that giveth and depriveth you of life, there is no God but he, be obedient to him, and observe his Law; praised be God, Lord of the Universe, who hath created you
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:36900:230"/>
of mire. Say unto the Infidels, I am forbidden to worship the Idols that ye adore; God hath taught me his unity, I have received command to worship none but the Lord of the Universe; he created you of dust, and mire, and congealed Blood, he causeth you to be born little Infants, he maketh you to arrive to the age of discretion, to virility, and old age; many die before that age, and all attain to the time of their destiny; peradventure ye shall understand his Unity; he it is that maketh you to live and to die, and when he willeth any thing, he saith, Be thou, and it is. See ye not, that they that dispute against his Commandments, depart from his Law? Such as reject our Commandments, and what we enjoyned our Prophets to preach to men, shall find their errors, when they shall see Chains on their Necks, and Fetters on their feet; they shall be dragged and burned in Hell; then shall it be said unto them, where are those Idols that ye adored upon Earth? They shall answer, they are depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from us, certainly they are without power; thus God seduceth Infidels to their confusion. It shall be said unto them, These pains befal you, for that ye were proud and insolent without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; enter within the gates of Hell, which is the habitation of the proud, ye shall dwell there Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. Be patient and and persevere, the word of God is infallible; I will make thee to see a part of what I have promised to men, I will cause thee to die, and thou shalt behold them all assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to be judged. Certainly we sent Prophets before thee, we have spoken to thee of one part of our Apostles, and the rest are concealed from thee; neither Prophet nor Apostles can preach any thing without God's permission; he chastiseth the wicked when he pleaseth, he shall judg the
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:36900:231"/>
differences that are between them and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and shall destroy the unbelievers. God hath created the beasts for your use; some ye eat, and others serve you to ride on, [from them] ye reap profit, they bear the burden, as likewise do the Ships for the advantage of your commerce; God manifesteth to you his graces: And what graces! Will ye despise them? Do not unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers consider the end of them that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, who were more powerful and rich than they? Their Treasures did not save them; they derided the Prophets and Apostles that preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them; and in the end felt the pains that they had despised. When they shall fear the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell, they shall say, We believe in One God alone, and renounce Idols. This professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith shall be unprofitable to them in Hell; they shall incur the rigor of the Law of God, that was observed against their predecessors, and all unbelievers shall be damned.</p>

               <p>IN the Name of God, gracious and merciful. The <hi>Alcoran</hi> was sent by the gracious and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God: It explaineth Divine Mysteries in the <hi>Arabique</hi> Tongue, to them that have knowledg to understand them; it proclaimeth to the good, the
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:36900:231"/>
delights of Paradise, and preacheth to the wicked the torments of Hell; nevertheless, the greatest part of the world depart from the Faith, and hear not thy words: They say, We have obdurate hearts, we cannot comprehend what thou preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, our ears are stopped, we are too remote to hear what thou sayest. Observe thy Law, we will live after our own. Say unto them, I am a man like you, your God is one sole God, be obedient to him, and beg pardon of him for your sins: Misery is upon unbelievers, that pay not Tythes, and believe not in the day of Judgment. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers that shall do good works, shall enjoy an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite reward. Say unto them, How, will ye be<note place="margin">Monday and Tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. See <hi>Gelaldin.</hi>
                  </note> wicked towards him that created the Earth in two days? how can you say that he hath a Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on equal to him? He is sole Lord of the Universe; he raised the Mountains, blessed the Earth, and gave to every Region the particulars thereof in four days, for them that shall have need: After this he ascended into Heaven, that was like unto smoke, and said unto Heaven and Earth, Ye shall obey me, either through force or affection: They answered, Lord, we will be obedient to thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.<note place="margin">Thursday and Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. See <hi>Gelaldin.</hi>
                  </note> He created seven Heavens in two days, and disposed every Heaven after his own will; he adorned them with Stars, and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them from the malice of the Devil. This is an effect of his Omnipotency; he is omnipotent, and knoweth all things. If the unbelievers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the Faith, say unto them, I have threatened you, as heretofore thunder did the people of <hi>Aad</hi> and <hi>Temod,</hi> when the Prophets taught them the Law of the ancient True-believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to wit, To worship but one God: They said, Were it Gods pleasure to alter our Law, he would have sent us Angels to reach unto us; we
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:36900:232"/>
will not beiieve in thy Mission. The people of <hi>Aad</hi> waxed proud on the Earth without reason, and said, Who is more powerful than we? will they not consider, that he that created them, is more powerful and wealthy than they? Nevertheless they despised our Commandments. We sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them a cold and impetuous wind, in an unhappy time, that made them to suffer on Earth shame and ignominy, because of their crimes: He shall cause them to feel the pains of Hell, that are much greater than those of the Earth, and they shall be eternally deprived of protection. We in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed the men of <hi>Temod</hi> in the right way; they preferred blindness to light, and impiety to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; they were surprized by thunder, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered great afflictions, because of their sins. We saved none of them, but the believers, who had our fear before their eyes. Be thou mindful of the day that the enemies of God shall be assembled in Hell, they shall defend their cause before the Judg, until testimony be brought against them; their ears, their eyes, and their skin shall be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of their iniquities: They shall say, Wherefore do ye witness against us? They shall answer, He that made us to speak, giveth speech to every thing; he it is that created you, and ye are this day assembled before him to be judged. Ye did not well conceal your selves, when ye offended him; your ears, your eyes, your skin are witnesses against you; ye believed that God should not see your sins, this was your opinion: Certainly he shall chastise you and you all shall be in the number of the damned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Persevere, and be thou patient, the fire of Hell shall be their habitation; they shall not be able to please God in the flames. We have given them the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils for their Companions, who caused them to delight in sin. The word of God shall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:36900:232"/>
against them, as it was accompllshed against their Predecessors, as well men as Devils, that are condemned. The unbelievers have said, Hear not that <hi>Alcoran,</hi> it is full of error; peradventure, ye shall be seduced. I will cause them to suffer grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous pains, and will chastise them after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits; such is the reward of Gods enemies. They shall remain eternally in the fire of Hell, because they despise his Commandments. The wicked shall say at the day of Judgment, Lord, let us see the Devils, and the men that seduced us? we will trample them under our feet, and precipitate them to the bottom of Hell. Such as shall have professed the Law of God, as shall have obeyed his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, shall be visited by the Angels, and shall that day be free from fear and affliction. They shall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>say unto them, Rejoice ye in Paradise, that is prepared for you; ye shall there find all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments that ye shall desire; they have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for you by the gracious and merciful. There is nothing better than to pray to God, than to do good works, and to profess his unity. Good and evil are not alike: Expel evil with thy good works. There is an exceeding great antipathy between Faith and Impiety: Faith is given to such as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe to do well, and to them that are endued with the grace of God. The Devil will tempt thee, but implore assistance from God; he heareth and knoweth all things. The night and the day, the Sun and the Moon, are Signs of his Omnipotency: Adore neither the Sun, nor the Moon, worship God that created them. If the Infidels resist the Faith, the Angels that are in Paradise desist not, notwithstanding, to exalt the glory of his Divine Majesty, day and night, without intermission. It is a sign of his Omnipotency, to see the barren and dry Earth to change the face, and become green,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:36900:233"/>
when it is watered with rain. He that maketh the plants to revive, is he that maketh every thing to live and die, he is Omnipotent. Such as depart from our Commandments, cannot hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from us: shall he that shall be precipitated into Hell, be better lodged than he that shall be saved at the day of Judgment; Do what shall please you, your Lord beholdeth all your actions. I will chastise them that traduce the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> it is a precious Book, it is approved by the ancient and modern Scriptures, it is sent from the glorious and merciful. None other thing shall be spoken to thee, than what hath been spoken to the Prophets that preceded thee; thy Lord is merciful and just. Had we sent the <hi>Alcoran</hi> in the <hi>Persian</hi> tongue, to a Prophet, an <hi>Arabian</hi> by Nation, the wicked would have said, That the Divine Mysteries are not well explained. Say unto them, It is the guide of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and a remedy to their ignorance. Infidels have deaf ears, they are blind, and hear not, as those that are called too far off: Certainly, we gave the Book and the Law to <hi>Moses.</hi> Unbelievers doubt, but if thy Lord had not said, That he would defer their punishment until the day of Judgment, he had already chastised them in this world, because they doubt of the truth. Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever shall do good, shall find good; and the evil that a man committeth, shall be against him. Thy Lord doth no injustice to his Creatures: None but he knoweth the day of Judgment; no fruit nor flower springeth out of the Earth, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man neither conceiveth, nor bringeth forth, but by his permission. Be thou mindful of the day that thy Lord shall call Idolaters, and demand of them, where be their Idols? They shall say, Lord, we acknowledg thy Unity; none of us will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after adore those false gods. They that worshipped
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:36900:233"/>
one God, departed from Idolaters; they know that the punishment of their sins is infallible. Man never ceaseth to require riches, and is troubled when evil befalleth him; if we give him good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his affliction, he saith, that he foresaw it, and hath no thought of the coming of the day of Judgment; if he be converted, thy Lord open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to him the Gate of Paradise. I will make the wicked to know their wickedness, and will most severely punish them; when we bestow wealth on man, he followeth his Idolatry and his sin; and when he is touched in affliction, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth in prayer: Say unto them, know ye not that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> proceedeth from God? neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less ye have renounced it; who is more impious than he that impugneth the known truth? I will cause them to see my Miracles, even to the utmost parts of Heaven and Earth, and in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to the end they may know the truth of the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> Sufficeth it not them that thy Lord seeth all things? nevertheless, they are in doubt of the Resurrection, and of being assembled before him to be judged; certainly God is omniscient.</p>

               <p>IN the Name of God, gracious and merciful. God is Prudent, Wise, Majestick; he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth all things, and is omnipotent; God hath sent thee the same inspirations that he sent to them that did precede thee; he is omnipotent and wise, whatsoever is in Heaven and in Earth appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:36900:234"/>
to him; he is omnipotent, and knoweth all things; the Heavens open at his command, the Angels exalt his glory, and implore his pardon for them that are on earth; he is merciful, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth them that invoke Idols, and knoweth them all, but thou art not their Tutor. We have inspired into thee the <hi>Alcoran</hi> in the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue, to preach to the Inhabitants of <hi>Mecca,</hi> and such as dwell about that City; we have sent thee to preach unto them the day of Judgment; there is no doubt that one part of men shall be saved, and the other shall be damned; had it pleased God, he had created them of one and the same Religion, he giveth his grace to whom he listeth, and Infidels shall be deprived of succour, because they have required the protection of Idols; but God is the true protector of the world: he reviveth the dead, and is omnipotent; he shall one day judg all the difficulties, and resolve all your doubts in your Religion, he is my Lord, I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend my self to his divine will; he created your wife of your selves, he created all beasts male and female, and caused you to multiply; there is not any thing like unto him, he keepeth the keys of the Treasures of Heaven and Earth, and taketh away, and giveth wealth as pleaseth him. The Law that I gave to <hi>Noah, Abraham, Moses,</hi> and <hi>Iesus,</hi> is that which I commanded thee to observe, <hi>viz.</hi> to believe in one God. The Infidels are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry when thou preachest to them the unity of God, he teacheth it whom he pleaseth, and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth into the right way them that obey him; the wicked approve some points of his Law, and reject the rest, although they have knowledg of his Unity, and that through the envy that is risen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; if thy Lord had not heretofore said that he would defer their punishment until the
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:36900:234"/>
day of Judgment, he had already destroyed them; many of those, who after them shall have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Scriptures, shall doubt of his Law; but follow thou the way that is appointed thee, and follow not their appetites: Say unto them, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Book that God hath sent, I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived commandment to preach unto you, that God is your, and our Lord; ye shall answer for your actions, and we shall answer for ours; it is not necessary to dispute against us, God will one day assemble us in his presence to judg our differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, he is our refuge; such as dispute against the faith, after knowledg of the truth, are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reason; their arguments shall be vain with God, they shall be the object of his wrath, and shall suffer exceeding great pains. God hath sent the <hi>Alcoran</hi> with truth and ballance; he will not instruct thee when the day of Judgment shall be: Such as have no faith in him, ask when it shall come, and they that believe him, fear the coming thereof, and know it to be infallible; such as doubt, are erroneous from the right way. God is merciful to his people, and enricheth whom he pleaseth; he is strong and omnipotent, he increaseth the graces of him that desireth the riches of Heaven; he giveth the wealth of the Earth to them that affect it, and depriveth them of the riches of Heaven: Are there wicked ones among men that teach them a false Religion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited of God? God hath not revealed it to them; had he not deferred their punishment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the day of Judgment, he had already destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them; they shall in the end feel grievous tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; ye shall see them fear their own deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ye shall see them chastised after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits; and the believers that do good works, shall enjoy the delights of Paradise, where they
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:36900:235"/>
shall find whatsoever they shall desire; this is the great grace of God; this is that which he hath proclaimed to the faithful that believed, and have done good works: Say unto them, I require none other recompence for the pains that I take in preaching to you, than to love my kindred; he that shall do any good work, shall be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, God is merciful, and good works are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to him. Will they say that thou hast blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed against God? If it please God, he shall hinder thee to hear this discourse, or will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print patience in thine heart; he abolisheth lyes, and confirmeth the truth through his words; he knoweth whatsoever is in the hearts of men; he accepteth the conversion of his Creatures, he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth their sins, and knoweth all their actions; he heareth the prayers of the faithful, that do good works, and augmenteth his grace upon them; but Infidels shall undergo the rigors of eternal pains. Had God equally enriched all his Creatures, they had been in confusion upon earth; he enricheth whom he pleaseth; he seeth and knoweth all; he sendeth rain when men despair of his grace, he is the Protector of believers, and praise is due to him eternally: the Creation of the Heavens, and of the Earth, and of all that moveth between them, is a sign of thine Omnipotency: If evil befal you, believe that ye have deserved it; nevertheless, he pardoneth you many things; ye cannot escape his punishment on earth, and none is able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect you against him; the vessel that runneth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the water, big as a mountain, is a token of his Omnipotency, to them that persevere in his Law, and acknowledg his graces. He shall reprove the wicked for their sins, and shall pardon many: They that dispute against his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, cannot escape their punishment; the riches
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:36900:235"/>
that we possess are the riches of the earth; the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that God bestoweth on them that trust in him, are eternal: They that depart from mortal sins, that repent to have committed them, that beg of God to be heard, and persevere in their supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; they that take counsel, and consult among them what they ought to do, that employ in good works part of the wealth that God hath given them, that implore his help in their afflictions; such as do good, and such as commit evil, shall be recompensed, and punished according to their works. God abhorreth Infidels; ye have no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer over them that implore his assistance in their affliction, and repent; your power extendeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them that do injustice to the people, and diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey on earth the Commandments of his divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty; they shall suffer great torments. Such as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe in well-doing, and pardon their neighbour, do what God hath Commanded. He whom God shall mislead, shall find none to guide him. Thou shalt see that the Infidels shall ask if they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into the world, when they shall behold the fire of hell; thou shalt see them flie with extream fear of external ignominy; they shall look awry upon hell, and the believers shall see that the wicked, that have lost their souls, that have mislead their family, and all the impious, shall be eternally damned, none shall be able to save them, and he that God shall mislead, shall not find the right way. Say unto them, beg pardon of God before the day come, that ye shall find no way to return into the world, nor excuse for your sins. If they disobey thee, we have not sent thee to be their Tutor; thou art sent only to preach unto them.

               <p>IN the name of God, gracious and merciful: God is prudent and wise. I swear by the Book that teacheth to do well, that we have sent it in the <hi>Arabique</hi> tongue, peradventure ye shall understand the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> it is written in our original Book, majestique and mysterious. Shall I conceal from you the Book of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if ye be wicked? How many Prophets and Apostles have we sent in past Ages whom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:36900:236"/>
have despised? We destroyed the most powerful among them, and all have incurred the pain of their predecessors. If thou ask of them who created Heaven and Earth; they will say, that it is the Omnipotent, who knoweth all things. Who hath extended the Earth under you? Who established the wayes to guide you? It is God, he causeth the rain to descend from Heaven in your necessity; he maketh the dead, dry, and barren fields to revive; in like manner shall the dead come out of their Sepulchers. He it is that created whatsoever is in the world, of divers kinds and species, and created the Ships, and beast, to carry you. Remember the grace of your Lord, say, praised be he that created for us these things; we had not the power to create them. They also shall return before the Lord to be judged. The Infidels have divided God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many parts. Certainly he that saith that there are many Gods, is impious; hath he appointed you to say, that the Angels which he hath created are his daughters, seeing that he giveth you Sons? When it is declared to some Infidels that a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is born to him, he is not satisfied, (he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to have a son) will they say that God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorneth himself, and taketh Ornaments to beautifie him like their Idols? It is a manifest er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror they say, that the Angels that worship God, are the daughters of his divine Majesty; I will write what they say, and will require of them an account of their discourse at the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They have said, had it pleased God, we had not adored the Angels; They know not what they say, and ignorantly blaspheme: do they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve any Scripture that hath been taught them heretofore? On the contrary, they say that their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers lived in like manner, and that they follow
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:36900:237"/>
their steps; they have said as much to all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that were sent unto them. When thou spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest to them to observe what is contained in the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran,</hi> and to abandon the Idols which their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers worshipped, they answered, that they believed neither in thee, nor in thy mission; but we avenged our selves upon them; Consider what is the end of blasphemers; Remember thou, that <hi>Abraham</hi> said to his father, and his people, I am innocent of the sin that you commit, in adoring Idols, I worship him alone that cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated me, he shall guide me into the way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and hath left his words to posterity; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Infidels shall be converted. I deferred heretofore the punishment of Idolaters, untill they had learned the truth, and that a Prophet came to instruct them; When he preached unto them the truth, they said, that it is but witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, and that they would give no faith to it. Had the <hi>Alcoran</hi> been sent to a man, <note n="*" place="margin">

He hath divided the riches of the world among men; Some there be that are more eminent, and scorn each other, but the mercy of God is more advantageous than the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Earth, which they accumulate: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all the people be not of the same Religion, we cease not to bestow on the wicked houses adorned with seelings, enchased with silver, stairs, doors, and beds of silver and gold; These things are the riches of the Earth, and Paradise is for them that are righteous. I will cause to fall headlong with the Devils, such as shall reject the Law of the merciful; the Devils shall be their companions, they shall seduce them from the way of Salvation, and they shall not

know it. When we shall come to judg the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, they shall say, Would to God we had been as remote from you, as the West is from the East. Oh what company for you! This day your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and your hopes shall be vain; ye were Infidels for company, ye shall be companions in the Fire of Hell. Wilt thou make the blind to see, and the deaf to hear? Wilt thou guide them that wilfully err? If they dye before being pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished on Earth, I will be avenged on them in the other World. Shall I shew thee during thy life, the punishment that we have prepared for them? We can do it, but do thou only what hath been commanded thee, thou art in the way of Salvation, instruct men therein; an account of thy mission shall be required of thee. I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an account of their mission that we sent heretofore to instruct the People, we will demand of them, if we appointed them to worship any other God but us. We sent <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his Ministers, he caused them to see our Miracles, and preached to them our Commandments; he told them that he was the Messenger of the God of the Universe, nevertheless they scoffed. I shewed them no greater Miracle than that of <hi>Moses</hi> his sister, and we chastised them, because of their incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity. They said unto <hi>Moses,</hi> Oh Magician! pray unto thy Lord, that he deliver us from these evils, and we will be converted; when they were delivered, they violated their promises; and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> said to his people, Am not I King of <hi>Aegypt?</hi> doth not the River <hi>Nilus</hi> flow under my obedience? Know ye not that I am more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than that poor wretch <hi>Moses,</hi> that knows not what he says? Give him <note n="*" place="margin">

He terrified his Subjects, they obeyed him, for they were Infidels, but we were avenged on them when they provoked us; we drowned them, and made them serve for example to Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, like those that preceded them in impiety. The people would not hearken to the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> when he spake by Parable; they said, Our Gods are more profitable to us than his lyes and questions. On the contrary, they were refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; he is our Servant, we conferred on him our grace, and made him like to the other Prophets of the Children of <hi>Israel:</hi> Had it pleased me, I had created Angels on Earth in your place; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Jesus, the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> shall be a sign of the certainty of the day of Judgment, doubt not concerning that day. He said unto men, Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me, it is the right way, beware lest the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil seduce you, he is your open Enemy. I come to teach you the Commandments of God, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve the doubts, and judge the differences that are among you; fear God, and obey him, he is your Lord and mine, worship him, it is the right way; the people doubted his Doctrine, but misery shall be upon the wicked, they shall suffer great torments at the Day of Judgment; will they expect that day for their conversion? It shall sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize them, and they know it not; that day shall they be enemies one of another, God shall say to the righteous, fear not, ye shall not this Day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent any affliction; the believers that have obeyed my Commandments, shall enter into Paradise, you and your wives shall there rejoyce, ye shall drink in cups of fine Gold; ye shall there find whatsoever ye shall desire, and all that can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the mind, and delight the eyes, and ye shall dwell eternally in supreme felicity; behold the Paradise that ye have gained by your good
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:36900:238"/>
life! it is enriched with abundance of fruits, which ye shall eat with contentment; and the wicked shall remain eternally in the Fire of Hell, they shall not be eased in their miseries, and shall be dumb with dispair; we do no injustice to them, they draw mischief on themselves, through their disobedience; they shall demand of the Keeper of the Fire, will thy Lord never deliver us from these pains? He shall answer them, Ye shall abide there eternally; We have taught men the truth, but the greatest part of them would not believe it. The wicked have conspired against thee, and we conspired against them; think they that I know not their secrets, and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they utter? The Angels our Messengers keep account; say unto them, If God have a Son, who shall we first adore? Praised be God, King of the Heavens and of the Earth; the matter is not as the Infidels deliever it: Leave them implunged in their impiety, let them laugh and rejoyce, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the day of their punishment arrive: One God alone ought to be worshipped in Heaven and Earth, he is most wise and Omniscient. Praised be he to whom appertaineth the Kingdom of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and Earth, and whatsoever is between them. He knoweth the hour and the day, that all the World shall be assembled before him to be judged. The Idols that the Infidels adore, shall not be able to intercede for them; the good intercede for them that have knowledge of the truth; if thou ask of men, Who created them? They will say, It is God; How can they then depart from his Commandments? Lord, this People is incredulous; Depart thou far from their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, they shall in the end, too late, acknowledg their errors.</p>

We have recommended to man, to honour Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother, and to do good to them; his Mother beareth him with pain, she bringeth forth with dolour, she giveth him suck, and weaneth him at the end of Thirty months; she hath care [of him] until he be in a condition to govern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and hath attained to Age of discretion.

of God, the Word of his Divine Majesty shall be accomplished against him, as it hath been accomplished against them that did precede him in impiety, as well Devils as men, they shall be damned; they shall be in sundry degrees of pains, he shall chastise them after their demerits, and no injustice shall be done to them. It shall be said to the wicked that would depart out of Hell fire, Ye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled your felicity, when ye lived in the World; your punishment was deferred until this present, ye shall this day be punished in this Fire, because of your pride and crimes. Remember thou the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Aad,</hi> who preached the torments of Hell in the Valley of <hi>Hecaf,</hi> his words was heard in his time, and are come to Posterity, <hi>viz.</hi> worship but one God alone; if you do otherwise, I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend for you the Day of Judgment: They answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, Art thou come to hinder us to adore our gods? Let us see the torments that thou preachest to us, if thou art true: He said, God knoweth in what time he will chastise you; I preach to you what hath been appointed me to preach, but I see that ye are obstinate. When they beheld a black cloud appear, which approached the place of their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, they said, Behold a Cloud that shall give us Rain; on the contrary, it is the punishment that ye have demanded, it is full of an impetuous wind that shall destroy you through the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God; in the Morning their houses were found empty of inhabitants. Thus God chastiseth the wicked; ye dwell in the places which they inhabited; they had hearts, eyes, and ears, but their hearts, eyes, and ears were to them unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; the evil which they despised befel them, when they neglected to observe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God. We have destroyed whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is round about <hi>Mecca,</hi> and have made the effects
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:36900:243"/>
of our Omnipotency to appear; peradventure the inhabitants thereof will be converted. The Idols that they worshipped, and those to whom they sacrificed, did not save them; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they forsook them, because of their blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies. Remember thou, that we sent to thee Devils, that desired to hear a Lecture of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran;</hi> when they heard thee, they said, Hark, he begins; and when thou madest an end, they returned with exceeding great fear, and said to their companions, We have heard a Lecture of a Book sent from Heaven after the Book of <hi>Moses,</hi> it confirmeth the ancient Scriptures, teacheth the truth, and guideth the people into the way of salvation. O people! hear him that calleth you to the Law of God, and to the observance of his Commandments; believe him, God shall pardon your sins, and deliver you from the pains of Hell: such as shall not hearken to him, shall not escape the punishment of their crimes, and shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of protection at the day of Judgment; such men are seduced from the way of salvation. Consider they not that God, who created Heaven and Earth, did not labour in creating them? that he is able to give life and death, and is omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent? Be thou mindful of the day that the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels shall desire to get out of the fire of Hell; it shall be said unto them, Are not the pains that were preached to you true? they shall say, yes Lord; it shall be said to them, Taste then the torments which ye have merited through your impiety. Persevere thou, as the Prophets thy Predecessors persevered. Be not impatient, till thou see the punishment of Infidels; they shall see it when they shall rise again, and shall believe that they have been but an hour in their Sepulchres: This is that which God hath commanded to preach;

               <p>IN the name of God, gracious and merciful. Good works are vain and unprofitable to the wicked, and to them that hinder their neighbour to follow the Law of God; he pardoneth their sins, who believe in what <hi>Mahomet</hi> hath preached; it is the very truth that proceedeth from his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majesty, but the Infidels have followed va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and the believers have embraced the truth sent from their Lord: Thus God speaketh to the people in Parables. When ye shall meet the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels in time of war, cut their necks, pursue them until ye take them prisoners, then bind them; after this, ye shall either give them liberty, or put them to ransome, until their party shall lay down arms. If God pleased, he could give you victory without fighting, but his will is to prove you; he guideth into Paradise, them that are slain for the defence of his Law, and giveth them his grace. Oh ye that believe in God! If ye protect the Law of God, God will protect you, he will confirm your steps, and destroy the Infidels, because they have contemned his Commandments, and their good works shall be to them unprofitable; consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

they not what hath been the end of the impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that were before them, and that God hath destroyed them? He shall destroy them in like manner, because he protecteth the Believers, and Infidels are deprived of his protection; he maketh the righteous to enter into Paradise, into Gardens wherein flow many Rivers. The punishment of the wicked is sometimes deferred in this world, they live like beasts, but the fire of Hell is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for their punishment. How many Cities, stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,<note place="margin">Mecca.</note> and more opulent than that which they cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thee to abandon, have we destroyed? They found no protection. Are such as embrace the Law of God like to them that follow their own appetites? God hath promised Paradise to them that have his fear before their eyes; there be in Paradise rivers of water, that receiveth no altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; there be rivers of milk that never corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, rivers of wine, savoury and delicious to the taste; rivers of honey, pure and clean; fruits of all sorts, and the grace of God for them that shall obey his Commandments; the wicked shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main eternally in the fire of Hell, where they shall drink a boiling liquor, that shall burn their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails. There be persons among the Insidels, that hear what thou dost preach; when they are gone from thee, their Doctors demand of them what thou hast said concerning the day of Judgment? God hath hardned the hearts of such men, and they shall never follow but their own passions. God encreaseth the graces of them that obey his Commandments, and fortifieth them in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance: Shall the Infidels tarry until the day of Judgment surprizeth them?

men and women, that believe in his Law, he knoweth what they do day and night: If the Chapter of the place where Justice is rendred, had not been sent, and had not made mention of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats, thou hadst not seen them, that doubt of the Law, look upon thee with eyes troubled, because of their fears of dying. Teach them obedience, and speak to them with civility. Had they believed, and obeyed, when they were appointed to fight, they had performed a good work. Have ye diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed? Have ye abandoned the Law of God, to defile the Earth? and to deprive your selves of his mercy? God rendreth them whom he curseth, and who comprehend not the truth of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> deaf and blind. Have they a firm heart? Such as have returned to their impiety, after having known the right way, were tempted of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and particularly, when they told the Infidels that they would obey them in any thing, God knoweth all their secrets; what will become of them when the Angels shall cause them to die? they shall beat them before and behind, because they have incurred the wrath of God, and despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his Commandments; their good works shall be unprofitable; think they that God will never make manifest their malice? If thou wilt, I will make it appear, thou shalt know them by their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, thou shalt discover them by their voice and speech. Say unto them, God knoweth all your actions; he shall prove you, to discover the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and the unbelievers. The wicked, who hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the people to follow the way of Salvation, that contradict the Prophet, after they have had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Law of God, hurt not his Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, their actions are vain and unprofitable.

disobedience; he pardoneth not the wicked, who seduce the people from the way of Salvation, and die in their impiety: Be not faint-hearted and flothful, ye shall be victorious, God is with you. He will not deprive you of reward; the life of this world is but foolish pastime and delusion; if ye believe in God, and have his fear before your eyes, he will recompence you for your good works, he requireth not an account of your riches; if he do require [it] of you, it is to hinder you to be avaricious, and to banish usury from among them that believe in his Law: Oh people! ye are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to make some expence for the love of God: He that shall be a niggard, and avaricious in this occurrence, shall be avaricious, and a nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to himself.

delivered the hearts of the believers from fear, to augment their faith; he disposeth the forces of the Heavens and Earth, he knoweth all, and is most prudent. He shall make them that shall obey his Commandments, to dwell in Gardens, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in flow many rivers, and shall remit to them their offences, this is supreme felicity: The Infidels, the wicked, the disobedient, and unjust, that have evil thoughts of God, shall be accursed of his Divine Majesty, misery shall always pursue them, and his wrath be eternally upon them; he hath prepared for them the pains of Hell. God disposeth the powers of the Heavens and Earth, he is omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and wise. We have sent thee to be witness of the deportments of those of thy Nation, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim to them the joys of Paradise, and to preach to them the pains of Hell, to the end they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God, and in his Prophet, that they may praise him, honour him, and exalt his glory eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and morning: Such as shall obey thee, obey God; the hand of God is stronger than the hand of men; he that shall sin, shall offend against his own soul; and he that performed what he hath promised to God, shall have an exceeding great reward. Such of the <hi>Arabians</hi> as have no inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to follow thee, say, thou imployest our wealth and persons to go with thee, implore therefore pardon of God for us; but they speak not with the mouth, what they have in the heart; Say unto them, who but God is able to do ought for you? if it be his will to bring good or evil upon you, he is omnipotent, and knoweth all that you do. Ye believed that the Prophet and True belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers should be slain when they fought for the Law of God; ye believed that they should never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their houses. This opinion rejoiced your heart, but you were deceived, and were your selves

When ye shall go to the spoil, such as refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed before to follow you to the fight, will say, Permit us to go with you; they would pervert the Word of God. Say unto them, Ye shall not follow us in this occasion, God hath not hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ordained it; they will reply, Certainly ye are envious against us; on the contrary, they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not the Law of God, except very few among them. Say to the <hi>Arabians,</hi> that refused to follow thee, Ye shall be called to fight against miserable men, ye shall fight them, nevertheless they shall still be obedient to God; if ye obey and fight for the Faith, he will largely reward you; if ye desert his service, as heretofore ye have done, he shall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely chastise you. The blind, the lame, and the sick, are not obliged to go to the war. He that shall obey God and his Prophet, shall dwell eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in Gardens, wherein flow many rivers; and he that shall disobey Gods Commandments, shall be punished for his disobedience. God accepted their action that repaired to thee under the tree, he knew what they had in their hearts, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed their steps, and gave them victory, he is omnipotent and wise. God had promised you great spoil, he gave it you, and delivered you from the hands of the people; this shall serve for a sign of his omnipotency to the true believers, he will conduct you into the right way; none but you could have atchieved that conquest, he well knew that that was for none other, he is omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent: if the wicked fight you, they shall fly, they shall turn the back, and find none to protect

God bestoweth his mercy on whom he pleaseth; had ye been separated from the unbelievers, we had severely punished them. When they were suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured of the ignorant, and had some advantage, God put his Prophet, and all the believers in a place of safety, they had recourse to the word of force and virtue, wherein they did better than the Infidels; God knoweth all. Assuredly the Dream of the Prophet of God was true, when he dreamed that ye were in the Temple of <hi>Mecca</hi> without fear, your hair shaven, and beards trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; fear nothing, God knoweth what you know not; in lieu of this Dream, he hath given you a great victory; he it is that hath sent you his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, to teach you his Law, more salutary than all other Laws of the world. It is sufficient, that God is witness that <hi>Mahomet</hi> is his Prophet, and Apostle; it sufficeth that the True-believers, who are with him, bear testimony. God encreaseth his mercy towards those Infidels that convert; thou shalt see them worship God, humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves before his Divine Majesty, and implore his grace; thou shalt know them by their

aspect, they shall have in their countenance the marks of their zeal; it is so written in the Old Testament and the Gospel; they are like a Plant that produceth its leaves, that grows strong by little and little, and becometh big, afterwards it taketh strength upon its roots, becometh a great Tree, and the wood thereof serveth to make war against Infidels. God hath promised his mercy, and an exceeding great reward to the Infidels that shall be converted, that shall believe in his Law, and do good works.</p>

If two Nations, or two Provinces, of such as believe in God are at odds, reconcile them; if the one do injury to the other, fight against him that is unjust, until he repair what God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained; if he make reparation, reconcile them with equity; be just, God loveth them that do justice to his people: All those that believe in his Law, are brethren; make peace among your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and fear God, he shall give you his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.

Behold a very strong re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn! we know assuredly what the Earth will do with us, we have a Book, wherein all is written; they impugn the known truth, and are in a great confusion: See they not Heaven above them, how we have built it, how we have adorned it, and how there is no defect?

with reasons clear and intelligible, he despised my Commandments, and said, That <hi>Moses</hi> was a Magician, and possessed of the Devil, but we surprised him, and drowned his People, to his great displeasure; <hi>Aad</hi> is an example of our Omnipotency: We sent an impetuous Wind against those wicked people, that destroyed them. <hi>Temod</hi> is an example of our Omnipotency, with his Nation; they waxed proud, and resisted the Commandments of their Lord; when it was said to them, that the punishment of the wicked was deferred to another time; but Thunder sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised them, they saw it, they had not the power to stand on their feet, and were deprived of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. The People of <hi>Noah</hi>'s time are an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our Omnipotency, we destroyed them, because they were impious: We built Heaven with strength and virtue; I am he that giveth power and strength; we extended the Earth, and created of every thing, Male and Female; perhaps ye will consider it. Say unto them, Turn ye to God; I am sent from him to preach to you the pains of Hell: Believe not that God hath another God with him; the wicked said heretofore, that the Prophets and Apostles whom he sent, were Magicians, and possessed of the Devil: Have they recommended to their Posterity to do the like? Certainly they are in a great error. Separate thy self far from their company, and be not troubled at what they say; preach the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> it is profitable to the Righteous; I did not create the Devils and men but to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship me. Say unto them, I require nothing of unbelievers for instructing them; I require not that they nourish me, God enricheth whom he pleaseth, he is omnipotent; the wicked shall be chastised as heretofore have been their predecessors,

Will ye swear that God hath daughters, and that ye have sons?

Ye follow only your passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, remote from the truth, God teacheth you the way of Salvation by the mouth of his Prophet; doth man obtain from Idols what he required of them?

               <p>IN the Name of God, gracious and merciful. The Day of Judgment approacheth, the Moon was divided into two parts, nevertheless Infidels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not Miracles when they see them; they say that this is Magick, they lye, and follow but their passion, but all is written. The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of past Ages, full of salutary Counsels, was preached to them; nevertheless Preachers were to them unprofitable; depart thou far from them, when they shall be called to the Universal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they will not believe; that Day shall their eyes be troubled with fear; they shall come out of the Earth, dispersed, like frighted Grass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppers, they shall flock to him that shall sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon them to Judgment, and shall say, Behold here a Day, unhappy for the wicked. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple heretofore belyed <hi>Noah,</hi> and said, That he was possessed of the Devil. <hi>Noah</hi> exhorted them, and invoked his Lord; in the end, he said, That his strength was gone, and that he was overcome through the malice of men; then was he power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully succoured; we opened the gates of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and caused an extraordinary Rain to fall; we caused Fountains to issue forth from under the Earth, the water of Heaven and Earth were gathered together, and overwhelmed the Infidels, because of their sins: We saved <hi>Noah</hi> in the Ark, well pinned, and chaulked, it floated upon the waters through our permission, to serve for a token of our Omnipotency; will any of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers of this time consider this? Will they
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:36900:254"/>
consider the punishment of their crimes, and the pains of Hell? We have made the <hi>Alcoran</hi> easie to be understood, will there be any that study it? The wicked that traduced <hi>Aad</hi> were chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but with what chastisement? We sent against them an impetuous wind, in a day to them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, that caused men to fall like Palms rooted up; consider what was their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; we have rendred the <hi>Alcoran</hi> intelligible, will there be any one that will study it? <hi>Temod</hi> and his People traduced the Prophets, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned their exhortations; they said, There is a man among us, who would seduce us from the right way, if ye follow him, he will lead you into Hell; was he alone elected among us to receive the inspirations of God? No, he is an Impostor; but in the end, they knew them that were wicked, and lyars. We sent the Camel to prove the Infidels; their Prophet observed what they did, and was patient, the water was divided for them, and for the Camel, and each at his day found to drink, nevertheless they called their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and slew the Camel of <hi>Salhe,</hi> but in what manner were they chastised? I darted Thunder against them, which made them dry as Chaff; we have made the <hi>Alcoran</hi> easie to be understood, Will there be any to study it? <hi>Lot's</hi> Citizens traduced him, and despised his instructions; we sent against them an hot wind, with burning stones, that destroyed them, and we in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing saved <hi>Lot,</hi> with his Family, through our spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial grace; thus do I recompence them that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my benefits. <hi>Lot</hi> had preached to them the pains of Hell, we surprized them; when they disputed against his exhortations, they saw his guests enter into the City, in the figure of men; we blinded their sight, and said, Taste oh
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:36900:255"/>
ye wicked! the punishment of your crimes; in the Morning they were chastised with a perpetual chastisement, because they despised the words of <hi>Lot.</hi> We have made the <hi>Alcoran</hi> intelligible, will there be any that will study it? Certainly the men of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> were preached unto; they would not obey my Law, and despised my Miracles, but we surprized them in their sins; Are the Infidels that are among you of more value than those that preceded them? Find ye any Salvation for them in the Scripture? Will they say they shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain victory over the believers? On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they are vanquished, and turn the back. Certainly the hour of their punishment shall speedily come, their time approacheth, and their pain in Hell shall be greater than that of the Earth, they are wholly seduced from the way of Salvation, and shall be dragged, and cast headlong into Eternal flames. We have crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all things by our sole power; we spake but one word, and in the twinkling of an eye the thing was; we heretofore destroyed a great number of Infidels like unto them, will there be any that considereth it? All the good and the evil that they have done is exactly written. The Righteous shall dwell in pleasant Gardens, they shall drink in Eternal Rivers, they shall not speak a Lye in their Assemblies, and shall dwell eternally near to the most Majestique and Omnipotent God.</p>

Majesty, and his Prophet, this is an immense grace, which he conferreth on whom he pleaseth. All the evil that ye suffer on earth, in your goods and persons, is written in a Book, before it befal you; it is an easie thing to God; to the end that ye afflict not your selves extraordinarily in your displeasures, and that ye rejoyce not over-much in your contentments; God loveth not the proud, he hath not to do with the covetous, who recommend avarice to the People, and who neglect their duty. Praise is due to him, praise is due to him in all places; certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we sent our Messengers with our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, we sent with them their Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and Ballance, that People might weigh with good weights. We gave Iron to men, it causeth great evils, and great good in the World, God knoweth them that fight with zeal for his Law and his Prophet, without seeing him, he is Strong and Omnipotent. We sent <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> to instruct the People; we instructed their Progeny in the Scripture; some followed the right way, and many disobeyed our Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; we sent after them our Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles; we sent <hi>Iesus</hi> the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> we taught him the Gospel; we put civility, clemency, and chastity into the hearts of them that followed him; we did not command them to keep Virginity, they kept it of their own accord, because of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire they had to please God; they have not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served their Law as they ought, many have been disobedient, but we have rewarded those among them that believed. O ye that believe in <hi>Iesus!</hi> fear God, and believe in his Prophet, ye shall have double the reward of God's mercy, he shall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don your sins, he is gracious and merciful: I teach you these things, to the end that such as have

No person among you shall swear never to touch his Wife no more than his Mother; your wives are not your mothers; your Mothers are those that conceiyed and brought you forth; they that speak in that manner, speak uncivilly, but God is gracious and merciful. He that shall have sworn to touch no more his Wife, and shall desire (afterwards) to know her, shall give liberty to a Slave, for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of his Oath, before he touch her; this is commanded you, God knoweth all your actions: if he have not the power to free a Slave, he shall fast two Months together, before touching her; if he cannot fast, he shall give to Fifty poor: Thus ought ye to do, if ye believe in God and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, God so appointed it, and hath prepared great torments for them that transgress his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. They that shall disobey him and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, shall be covered with shame and ignominy, as were their Predecessors in impiety; God hath

sent his Commandments on Earth, those who shall reject them, shall be severely tormented at the day that he shall revive them, he shall declare to them all that they have done, he hath kept ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and they have forgotten it, he seeth all. Seest thou not that all that is in the Heaven and Earth is Gods? If ye be Three secretly met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he is the Fourth; if ye be Five, he is the Sixth; if ye be more or less, he is always with you wheresoever you are. He shall relate to men at the Day of Judgment all that they have done, he knoweth all things. Seest thou not the actions of them to whom private meetings were prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? They return to their sin, and do what was forbidden them; they assemble secretly with malice to conspire against thee, and to disobey thee; and when they come towards thee, they say, that thou hast spoken things that God hath not inspired thee to utter; they know in their Souls that God will chastise them for their discourse, and that they all shall go into Hell, where their Rendezvous is: Oh ye that believe! make no private meetings to offend God, to conspire against his Prophet, and to disobey him; assemble ye to perform acts of Virtue, and to serve God; have his fear before your eyes, ye shall once appear before his Divine Majesty to be judged. Private assemblies proceed from the Devil, for the affliction of the Righteous: He bringeth no evil upon them, but through God's permission; and all believers ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign themselves to his Divine Will. O ye that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve! when ye shall be assembled with your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and are entreated to inlarge your selves, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large ye your selves, God shall inlarge to you his grace. When ye are bid to rise, rise, God shall raise up all the True believers that are among you, and place the learned some degrees above others, he

O ye that believe! when ye shall be disposed to deliver any secret to the prophet, speak to him with truth, good shall befal you, and [he] shall purifie you: If ye fear to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to him your secret, God will not give you his grace. Make your prayers at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, distribute Tithes, obey God and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, God knoweth what ye do: Seest thou not them that have abandoned his Law? The wrath of his Divine Majesty is faln upon them, they are of different opinion in their lye, and know not that they lye, but he hath prepared for them a great punishment, because of their blasphemies; they have concealed their Faith, and are seduced; certainly he hath prepared for them grievous pains, their Wealth and their Children shall not be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them from his Indignation, they shall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated into the Fire of Hell, where they shall abide eternally. Be thou mindful of the day, when he will cause them to revive; they shall swear, as they swear before thee, that they believed in his Law; they affirm they do good, and are Lyars, the Devil hath prepossessed them, and hath made them forget the word of God; such as follow him are damned. They that transgress the will of God, and that of his Prophet, are overcome of the Devil; God hath said in the Scriptures, thou shalt not obtain victory over me, neither over my Prophet, he is Omnipotent, and alway victorious; thou shalt find none of them that believe in his Law, and the Day of Judgment, that doth not exactly observe the Commandments of his Divine Majesty, and those of his Prophet, although their Fathers, their Children, their Brethren, and companions oppose them.

They that before them forsook their houses for the Service of God, affect those that have followed them, they bear them no malice for the wealth they possess, although themselves are necessitous.

God hath not to do with them that obey Infidels, neither hath he need of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and praise is due to him in all places; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure he will establish for the future great amity between you and them that ye hate, he is omnipotent, gracious, and merciful; he doth prohibit you the conversation of them that fight not against you for his faith, and that expel you not from your houses; he doth not forbid you to do them justice, he loveth the just; He forbiddeth you to converse with them that fight against your faith, that drive you from your houses, and aid to expel you; he prohibiteth you to obey them, and to contract amity with them: such as obey them, shall be exceedingly too blame. O ye that believe in God! when the wives of your enemies shall throw themselves into your party, try their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: if ye know them to be faithful, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Law of God, restore them not to the incredulous Infidels, it is not lawful for them to know them, neither for the women to teach them: give them subsistence, ye shall not sin in espousing them: marry them not after the laws of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; demand of them what dowry they require: they shall demand of you what ye are willing to bestow on them: continue in accord, God so commandeth, he shall be your judg at the day of Judgment, he knoweth all your actions, and is most wise.

When the wicked shall come to visit thee, they will say, That they are witnesses, that thou art a Prophet sent from God; he well knoweth that thou art his Prophet, he seeth that they dissemble, and sell their Faith to enjoy wealth in the World, wherein they commit evil; they say with the mouth, We believe in the Law of God, and are impious in their Souls, impiety is imprinted in their hearts, and they will not learn the Mysteries of Faith; the beauty of their bodies shall not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>splease thee, when thou shalt see them; they erect themselves when they speak, and resemble a piece of wood set up against a wall; they fear all ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors that fly abroad, and are your enemies. Beware of them, doubtless God will destroy them; how can they blaspheme against his Law? When it was said to them, Come to the Prophet, he shall beg pardon of God for your sins, they shook the head, and withdrew with pride; misery is upon them; whether thou implore pardon for them, or dost not implore it, God will not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them, he abhorreth the wicked. They say, Do no good to them that follow that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of God, until they abandon him; the treasures of Heaven and Earth are Gods, but they comprehend it not; they say, If we return to the City of <hi>Medina,</hi> we will drive thence shame and infamy, and will there establish Greatness and
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:36900:266"/>
Honour; on the contrary, Greatness, Power, and Victory proceed from God, his Prophet, and them that believe in his Law, but Infidels under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it not. Oh ye that believe in God! your Riches, and your Children ought not to seduce you from his Service; such as shall forsake it, shall be in the number of the damned; give alms of the Wealth that he hath given you, before the Hour of your Death arrive; then shall the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed say, Lord, if thou hadst not so soon caused me to die, I had embraced thy Law; God retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the day of any one, when the Hour is come; he knoweth all that ye do.</p>

He created the Heavens and the Earth, he formed you, and ye shall be one day assembled before him to be judged, he knoweth all that is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, he understandeth your secrets, and what ye publish, he is not ignorant of what is in the hearts of men.

They despised them, and forsook the Law of God; he hath not to do with them, neither hath he need of the World, praise is due to him in all places; do the wicked believe that they shall not rise again? Contrariwise, God shall make them to revive, and shall declare to them all that they have done; this thing is easie to his Divine Majesty; Believe in God, his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and the light that he hath sent you, he knoweth all your actions. Remember thou the day, when he shall Summon all to Judgment, this shall be the Day of Deceit; they shall be known that have deceived themselves, and those that have deluded their Neighbours. That day their sins shall be pardoned, that shall have believed in his unity, and have done good works, they shall dwell eternally in Gardens, wherein flow many<note place="margin">See <hi>Kitab el tenoir.</hi>

O ye that believe! ye have Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Wives, that are your enemies, beware of their malice, if ye pardon them; if ye depart from them, God shall be to you gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful.

Believe ye, that he who is in heaven is not able to send against you an impetuous wind, to destroy you? Ye shall hereafter feel what are the torments of hell. Your predecessors would not believe them, and were chastised for their incredulity. Consider ye not the birds that flie over your heads, how they extend, and shut their wings? nothing sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth them, but that mercy that beholdeth all things.

The Infidels are proud: Who shall enrich you, if God restraineth his grace? nevertheless ye persevere in your sins, and flie the truth; Is he that creepeth on his face, like to him that goeth on his feet in the right way? Say unto them, God hath created you; he hath given you sight, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and sense, but few among you return him thanks for his graces: Say unto them, he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you of earth, and ye shall one day be assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled before him, to render account of your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.

               <p>IN the Name of God, gracious and merciful. Misery is upon him that persecuteth his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; Persecution hath its Counter-Persecution. He that heapeth up treasures, and is busied to count them, thinketh they will make him immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, but they shall precipitate him into his misery; I will not tell thee into what misery, but the fire of hell is always kindled to burn the heart of the wicked; they shall be overwhelmed in flames, and bound to great pillars.</p>
