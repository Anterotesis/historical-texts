            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hile I trouble not my Reader with other Preface, I muſt not omit to give him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of thus much at the firſt; that M <hi>Horn's</hi> Catechiſme, called <hi>Brief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions for children,</hi> was brought me by a friend, with this ſmall requeſt that I would peruſe it; which though I might perhaps have ſeen before; yet as then, had I not read ſo much as one entire page of it, howſoever it had been extant for above the ſpace of five years. But for the next requeſt he made, that I would let him know what I thought of it, eſpecially ſome of the Anſwers in it; it was not enough to tell him that he knew, the better of the two, how to judge of it: and for his further deſire, that I would write ſomething in brief, touching what I thought therein to be unſound; it might not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to ſay, That to be <hi>Cenſor librorum,</hi> or but <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belli,</hi> was too high and hard a task for me, though it were but in a private way: ſo that the motion with ſome earneſtneſs redoubled, took place with him that is of this minde, that whoſo with importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſets another on work, ſtands reaſonably charged, in ſome ſort, with the faults and failings.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, and in ſuch a licentious ſeaſon, wherein every opinion dares boldly bring a voucher

ready; though we can do little elſe, we cannot but complaìn, that whatſoever libertie be given to other Diſcourſes, ſome of them too wilde and ſcathfull; books of Chriſtian Inſtitution, which lay down the firſt Principles, ſhould be no more heeded and lookt after, but paſs abroad without all cenſure and inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: That Catechiſmes which are the publick ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns or receptacles, made and framed the better to hold the water derived from the ſpring of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly word, for benefit of the young and ignorant, ſhould be no better preſerved and guarded, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that nothing noxious or unwholſome be inje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. The law of God ſeverely forbade his people, to remove the land-marks that their forefathers had ſet down and faſtened: and the Romanes from <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> thus, <hi>Qui terminum exarâſsit, ipſus &amp; boves ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cri ſunto</hi>: there may be cauſe given oftentimes to poſteritie, entangled in endleſs contentions, to curſe the memorie of thoſe who pluck up that which they never ſet. Articles of Religion, and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Faith, and forms of Catechiſme, are the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred terms and bounds of particular churches, fixed as the ſureſt conſervatours of peace, as well as of the truth.</p>
               <p>But as the laws, are not made for the righteous, whoſe obedience moveth from a ſtronger ſpring; but for the unrighteous, looſe and irregular: ſo theſe limits now ſpoken of, are chiefly for the ignorant and unſtable; for the untaught, that are in danger to be ill taught; for ſuch as make the multitude
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96773:3"/>
one of their marks, whereby to finde out the truth of Chriſtianitie; for other Chriſtians, who are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the land, and are firmly built upon that truth which they have learned of men, but not of men onely; they make good the want of outward or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſupply the defect of humane Authoritie, by their greater care and diligence; that they may not be found as chaff when the floor is purged with the fan of hereſie and ſchiſme; that they may ſave themſelves, and others, ſo far as they may, from an untoward and backſliding generation: as Davids zeal was the more kindled, becauſe of others wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs: <hi>They have made void thy law,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Therefore I love thy commandments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No marvel is it, of ſuch perſons as this authour is, who dread and deprecate all national eſtabliſhment of Religion, as ſanguinary perſecution; but matter of wonder is it as well as grief, that any of thoſe that worthily lament the breaking down of the hedge, ſhould be among the firſt of them, that lay to their hands to ſpoil the vines: and being aggrieved at the removal of that government, which is indeed the beſt ſimply, and as I think the beſt always, ſhould be with the forwardeſt, to take advantage of no government at all, whereby to ſpread and propagate opinions moſt contrariant and deſtructive to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our Church, when it was rightly conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But while I ſpeak of limit and good order, it is fit to keep my ſelf to what I am about.</p>
               <p>In the title of theſe Brief inſtructions, that clauſe [<hi>as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96773:4"/>
may beſt ſerve the capacitie of children</hi>] might well have been omitted, unleſs he had meant to leave out that which follows in the title, concerning the great myſteries, there ſpecified; and that which follows, and bears a great proportion in the book, concerning the Quinquarticular controverſies: For think you theſe to be fit matter of inſtruction for children? If this be milk, I wonder what he count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſtrong meat. Heretofore it hath been ſaid, that theſe things ſhould be argued in ſchools, among the learned, and not be made the ſubject of our Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies <hi>ad populum,</hi> or treated of in vulgar auditories, to fall upon theſe points <hi>there,</hi> was a matter of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, and an iniquitie to be puniſhed, and have they already found ſo large a room in brief Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for children?</p>
               <p>Solomon giveth this warning in the 17 of the Proverbs, <hi>Qui attollit oſtium, quaerit ruinam</hi>; He that exalteth his gate ſeeketh deſtruction: whether it be a moral caution againſt vain pretences, and high preſumptions; or oeconomical, adviſing men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of over-chargeable and too coſtly ſtructures, leſt they be unable to go on, and finiſh; and for want of foreſight, come at laſt to build themſelves quite out of doors. [<hi>The great myſteries of redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, faith, works, law, goſpel, of predeſtination, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, reprobation opened</hi>] appears at firſt approach, too high a gate, too loſty a frontiſpiece for a chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Catechiſme: but I cannot beleeve that ever he thought theſe points ſo needfull to be learned at
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96773:4"/>
firſt beginning: that was not the chief intent. The young ones muſt betimes be prepoſſeſſed with a vile opinion <hi>of the preſent pretended Orthodox</hi>: and this is the ſcope of many of the Anſwers they are to learn: <hi>Hannibals</hi> father brought him along to the Altar, and made him lay hold on it with his hands, and there he ſwore him againſt the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, when he was but nine years old. And the children muſt be brought early to know their foes, and what they are againſt whom they muſt bend their forces, and emptie their qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: not againſt the Papiſts, nor the Anabaptiſts, nor the Socinians: no danger being feared now, it ſeems, from any of theſe: but the pretended ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox that walk by vote, and Elders tradition. Againſt theſe they muſt be taught to beleeve, that they <hi>are of a Satanical perſwaſion.</hi> Anſw. 199. and that they hold moſt <hi>horrible impieties.</hi> Anſw. 298. with other reproaches and all for beleeving Gods free and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace, and that he doth not love all men alike. And theſe Anſwers they are to get by heart, and lay them up in the ſtore-houſe of their memorie, that ſo they may be ready at all times to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to him that asketh, of the malice that is in them: howbeit the Apoſtle faith, In underſtanding be ye men, but in malice be ye children, as if malice, uncharitableneſs and hatred of others, were not to be found in <hi>them,</hi> nor are they ſo comparatively, unleſs it be where ſuch inſtructions as theſe are planted. But it is the ſureſt way, and that he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96773:5"/>
well, to train them up early in the way he would have them go, that ſo they may not depart from it in their older age; to fill them with animoſities ſo ſoon as they be capable againſt the perſons and opinions of their adverſaries. As there is no friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to that which is called <hi>Praetextata amicitia</hi>: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Scolium a kinde of ſong, in <hi>Athenaeus</hi> makes it the fourth point of felicitie <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is, to have neighbourhood and acquaintance with ſuch as have been brought up together with us from our childhood: ſo there is no enmitie like that which children are ſeaſoned with all, at their firſt ſetting out, and bred in from their green and tender years: <hi>Creſcent illi, creſcetis &amp; irae</hi>; As they grow up, their diſaffections alſo increaſe and gather ſtrength with them. But if abrenunciations, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative poſitions have been thought unfit, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune to be thruſt into a Confeſſion of Faith, or Articles of Religion agreed upon; then doubtleſs, ſuch condemnation of contrary erroars, as doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve the parties alſo, and reflect upon the perſons, doth much leſs become the delivery of the very firſt principles.</p>
               <p>In the Preface is this profeſſion made.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">I do indeed about the goodneſs of God towards, and the death of Chriſt for men, varie from the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>road of the preſent pretended orthodox, becauſe they leave the Scripture-road, and walk in a by-path of ſome Elders tradition. I would have you and yours with my ſelf, not walk by vote, but by rule, the word of God.]</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:96773:5"/>The road is not therefore to be forſaken, becauſe it is common: as <hi>multitude</hi> is the <hi>Papiſts</hi> miſt, which they would caſt before our eyes; ſo is <hi>paucity</hi> the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi>: but God hath given us no ſuch rule as either: and as it is unthankfulneſs; and worſe than ſo, when God hath given Kings and worldly powers to propagate and cheriſh Chriſtian Religion, then to crie out, <hi>Not many noble</hi>; ſo is it alſo, when as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do ſlie as a cloud of Doves to the windows of the Church, and God fulfills his gracious promiſes of multiplying beleevers as the ſand, or the ſtars, or the numberleſs drops of dew from the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings womb, then to crie out of following the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, or walking in a common road. <q rend="margQuotes">[<hi>Not by vote,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>nor by mans precept, but by the word of God.</hi>]</q> 
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Vote, and the rule of Gods word may be, not contrary but ſubordinate.

If a ſingle Paſtour write a Catechiſme, and frame Anſwers, that he would have his pariſhioners, or people, over whom he is ſet, to learn, and get by heart are they not now taught by the precept and appointment of man? Is there not as much lording or dominion over the faith of others, in a pariſh, or ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, as there is in a Dioceſs, Province, or Nation? Should we in earneſt walk after this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, here plainly taught and delivered; as the Jews in the Prophet Jeremy are ſaid to multiplie
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96773:6"/>
their gods, <hi>ſecundùm numerum civitatum,</hi> according to the number of their cities; ſo muſt we multiplie our Creeds <hi>ſecundùm numerum capitum,</hi> ſo that every particular perſon may have a form of faith by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: which is the very ſpirits and heart of Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme.

               <p>And as to the particular, touching which he now enters his diſſent; he loveth to raiſe a perpetual duſt, whereſover he goeth, about the extent and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of benefit by Chriſts death, and injuriouſly chargeth his adverſaries, with broad denial of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſayings, becauſe they interpret one ſentence by another, and are unwilling to make uſe of the univerſal particle <hi>All,</hi> or <hi>Every one,</hi> therewithall to overthrow the contents of the Goſpel, and as with a helve or handle, to cut down the chief trees of the forreſt. And whatſoever he talketh here of the <hi>Scripture-road,</hi> and rule of Gods word: as if this were it, that did bear the ſway with him, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him on ſo ſtrongly; I have cauſe to ſuſpect it to be but talk, out of what I finde in a late work of his, called <hi>Eſſays</hi>: for pag. 24. he obſerveth that thoſe words Act. 13. 48. were no part of <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine by him then preached, but onely an

aſſertion of <hi>Luke,</hi> the writer of the Apoſtles Acts: and telleth us further, that it is ſafer to ſtick to <hi>Paul,</hi> than to <hi>Luke,</hi> if they diſagree, though he thinketh here he can reconcile them.</p>
               <p>But will he indeed ſtick to the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>? Neither. for pag. 36. He telleth us that thoſe places in <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, which ſeem to claſh with Gods willing all men to be ſaved, and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that diſcourſe of his Rom. 9. Are thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces hard to be underſtood that <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh of 2 Epiſt. 3. 16. So that he hath bethought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, how he may eaſily anſwer all that can be brought againſt him, out of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> the Champion of free grace though he be; for if the argument that is brought be hard to be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; then the place whence it is taken, is hard to be underſtood; and it muſt be ſuppoſed not to be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood, ſo long as it ſhall ſeem to croſs the Univerſaliſts. And thus in ſtead of walking by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vote, he plainly and peremptorily walketh by his own will, and without regard, or heed ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, wreſteth to his purpoſe that very Scripture, that warneth us of the fearfull danger of wreſting any.</p>

               <p>I think him much miſtaken in unfolding thoſe words of our Church-Catechiſme [<hi>The ſinfull luſts of the fleſh</hi>]. It had been a good work to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed his ſcholars, in the right meaning of the word <hi>fleſh,</hi> as it is taken in that place. The <hi>Jews,</hi> as <hi>Buxtorfius</hi> tells us in his <hi>Synagoga,</hi> when their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren come to be paſt ſeven, are wont to learn them <hi>Nomenclations,</hi> and how to call and know by the right names, thoſe things that are of daily uſe in life and common converſe. Without preſumption to give direction, a great part may be allotted in the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, to the explication of Divinitie-terms, for want of which, wholeſome and ſound diſcourſes are often either quite loſt, or ſerve to breed in men, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes and errours.</p>
               <p>Our three enemies, to be fought againſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, are the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>Devil.</hi> Now in this Anſwer M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Horn</hi> takes the word <hi>Fleſh,</hi> for the work of God, or created nature, even ſuch as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96773:9"/>
was in our bleſſed Saviour, as by his text of <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. appears. But it is not the <hi>ſinfull</hi> luſts of the Fleſh; it is the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> which in Scripture ordinarily, without any manner of Addition, is ſpoken of, as our Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual enemy, and it ſignifies, not the Body, nor yet ſenſe and appetite, inferiour to reaſon; but it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the corruption of our nature, repugnant to the Law of God, defiling Body and Soul, and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt faculties of the minde. And thus the beſt of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh expoſitours interpret the word; howſoever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of them ſo give the meaning, that many of their common followers, think that to crucifie the fleſh, is to ſtarve themſelves; as they think that to renounce the world, is to go into a Monaſtery, where they enjoy the plenty of the world, without the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that belongs to it. A man would think, ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine, De Civ. Dei, lib.</hi> 14. <hi>cap.</hi>2. that the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureans lived according to the fleſh, becauſe they followed bodily pleaſures: and the Stoicks accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Spirit, becauſe they placed happineſs in the minde; <hi>Sed ſicut loquitur Scriptura divina, ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dùm carnem vivere utrique monſtrantur</hi>: but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the holy Scripture ſpeaketh, both of them live according to the fleſh. That which deceived him, was, as I ſuppoſe, the Epithet of <hi>ſinfull</hi>: as if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome luſts of the fleſh were not ſinfull. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Epithets are not always put for diſtinction, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for Amplification and Efficacy. So may we read <hi>Vaſtum aequor, gelidum Boream,</hi> for Emphaſis, and not Difference: and in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. 23. <hi>Spiritus juſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum

As theſe, did forego his Sacrifice, ſo did they prepare ſo it: but that his death ſhould be a preparation to his Sacrifice; and that his Sacrifice ſhould onely be prepared on earth, and offered in Heaven; is a new part of learning, and ſoundeth ſomewhat ſtrange, out of what ſhop ſoever it came and to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſoever it was firſt forged.</p>
               <p>Our Church hath taught us, that Chriſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the croſs, did make THERE, a full, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect &amp; ſufficient Sacrifice, oblation and ſatisfaction, and our Saviour ſaid upon the Croſs, <hi>It is finiſhed.</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:96773:12"/>
And when the Apoſtle to the Coloſſians, C.2.V.14. ſaith that the handwriting was blotted out, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the way, or, out of ſight, and (to make it paſt all fear of ever being produced againſt us) that it was nailed to his croſs, that is, cancelled, and torn in pieces; there needeth nothing more to be ſaid, to let us know that there needeth nothing more to be done, for perfecting the Sacrifice and expiation. For whether he ſpeaketh in reference to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial, or the moral law or both, it was a full and complete Sacrifice to the purpoſe intended. And holy Scripture plainly ſpeaketh of his death, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, as preciſely the ſame: the altar being the croſs, and no other propitiatory Sacrifice, but his body crucified and dead. Hebr.9. 26, 28. Chriſt muſt not <hi>offer</hi> often, becauſe he muſt not <hi>ſuffer</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and he muſt not <hi>ſuffer often,</hi> becauſe it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for men <hi>once,</hi> and but once to die: To <hi>offer,</hi> and to <hi>ſuffer,</hi> and to <hi>die</hi>; are in this caſe, made the very ſame thing. And even in common ſpeech, and in common ſenſe, the ſacrifice of any thing conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the killing of it: and if it be of a thing ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate, then it conſiſteth in the conſuming of it: but neither killing nor conſuming, is the preparing of the Sacrifice. Where was Chriſt ſlain? was it not upon the earth? yes: and ſhall he be ſacrificed in heaven? or where was ever the killing the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, called the preparing of it?</p>
               <p>There was among the Jews, the Preparation of the Paſs-over; and the killing of the Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96773:13"/>
and the eating of the Paſs-over, theſe three. It is true that the killing of it, did prepare for the eating of it. But the eating of it, was the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of it, not the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of it. The pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or texts of Scripture, ſuch as carry any colour, may be conſidered. Hebr. 8. 4. <hi>For if he were on earth, he ſhould not be a Prieſt, ſeeing that there are Prieſts that offer gifts according to the law.</hi>] From which words, he may as well gather, that Jeſus Chriſt was not a Prieſt at all, upon earth, as that he did not complete his ſacrifice upon earth: but it was granted he was a Prieſt in preparing the Sacrifice. Anſw. to Qu. 83. By ſhewing the meaning of that place, his miſtake will appear. The Apoſtle prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Jeſus Chriſt before the Levitical High Prieſt, among many other reſpects, in this for one, The place, where now he is. Our High Prieſt is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, made higher then the heavens, c. 7. v. 26. c. 8. v. 1. A miniſter of the Sanctuary, verſ. 2. that is, The Holy of Holies, the Oracle, or moſt ſacred Quire, wherein, under the law, the High Prieſt one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did officiate: which place, as formerly, it did ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifie, ſo here it doth ſignifie heaven it ſelf. On this, dependeth the fourth verſe: wherein he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that if a Chriſt be a Prieſt, as that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for granted; he muſt be a Prieſt in heaven, for if he were on earth, he ſhould not be ſo much as a Prieſt, much leſs a High Prieſt. For Prieſts on earth offer gifts preſcribed by the Levitical law: ſuch gifts Chriſt did not offer: ſuch a Prieſt therefore
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96773:13"/>
Chriſt was not, he was not of the tribe of Levi: no Levitical Prieſt, therefore he offered no Levitical gifts: other earthly Prieſts there are to do that. Therefore muſt he be a Prieſt offering in heaven, or no Prieſt at all. Now our Catechiſt ſhould have conſidered, how theſe words, in verſe 4. are brought in, and to what they belong, the Apoſtle ſpeaketh not now of ſacrifices, ſlain and offered in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by the Prieſts; but of ſuch oblations as were made by the High Prieſt in the moſt holy place, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which he entred once a year, and thereby did ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow out our High Prieſt, who entred into heaven, and offered there ſuch ſervices as we needed, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he had finiſhed the Sacrifice of himſelf on earth.</p>
               <p>In this Epiſtle are often mentioned, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, gifts, and ſacrifices: in this fourth verſe, onely, gifts are named; all ſacrifices are gifts, but all gifts are not ſacrifices. Our High Prieſt being aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into heaven, offereth, as a Gift, not as a Sacrifice, himſelf; and the merit of his paſſion, as the High Prieſt carryed the bloud into the Oracle: And as Aaron did bear the names of the twelve tribes upon his breaſt, ſo doth our High Prieſt, the names of all his faithfull people: he offereth prayers for them, and incenſe with their prayers, that they may be accepted.</p>
               <p>But eſpecially he would abuſe his Reader here upon the Homonymie or ambiguitie of the word, <hi>offer</hi>: which though by frequent uſe it be in ſome
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96773:14"/>
ſort appropriate to ſacrifices, yet is it ſometimes otherwiſe uſed, as, To him that ſmiteth thee on the one cheek, <hi>offer</hi> alſo the other; and, if he ſhall ask an egg, will he <hi>offer</hi> him a ſcorpion? it may mean no more than to tender, exhibit, ſhew: no more than to proffer, produce, or bring forth: as much as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or repreſent, if we take this word, after the Latine uſe, which is, to bring forth any thing and make it preſent. <hi>Suetonius</hi> of the Emperour <hi>Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us: poenas parricidarum repraeſentabat,</hi> he would ſee them ſuffer before his face, or in his preſence. Such is the uſe of it in <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and often in <hi>Tertullian.</hi> And in this ſenſe did our High Prieſt offer himſelf at the throne of Majeſty; on the <hi>croſſ</hi> he offered his <hi>Sacrifice</hi>; but in <hi>heaven,</hi> he preſenteth his <hi>Gift,</hi> his body, his merits, his prayers, his incenſe, our names alſo, or perſons, in ſome ſort; gifts or ſervices, all of them, but Sacrifice none of them.</p>
               <p>Theſe two words [<hi>offer</hi> and <hi>preſent</hi>] are coupled together in the Anſwer thus. He in his Aſcenſion offered, and preſented himſelf as the prepared Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to his Father] To offer a prepared Sacrifice, is one thing; which Chriſt then did not; it is another to preſent himſelf, who was before offered in Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and thus did our Prieſt and Advocate, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſour, appear in the preſence of God for us, Hebr. 9. 24.</p>
               <p>So this is the abuſe, to make us beleeve, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe whatſoever is preſented <hi>may</hi> be ſaid to be <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,</hi> therefore it muſt be offered as a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:96773:14"/>Another Text is, Pſal. 110, <hi>Thou art a Prieſt for ever.</hi> The eternity of his Prieſthood can be no where but in heaven. Therefore, no where but in heaven was his Sacrifice perfected. Thus he ſeemeth to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thence. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Prieſt, and Sacrifice, are relative, where one is, the other is alſo. A prieſt muſt offer ſacrifice; but it is not requiſite that he ſhould do it always <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> it is enough that it be done <hi>in actu ſignato</hi>; that is, that he <hi>will</hi> offer, or <hi>hath</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, or <hi>can,</hi> according to Law and Rite, offer ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Jeſus Chriſt <hi>is a Prieſt for ever,</hi> but he doth <hi>not ever,</hi> or always <hi>ſacrifice.</hi> The Sacrifice was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered but once (and how often doth the Apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe that word <hi>Once</hi>?) by vertue of which, he was conſecrated a Prieſt for ever. One Text more Hebr. 9. 12. <hi>by his own bloud he entred into the Holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us</hi>] <hi>Anſw.</hi> But this bloud was ſhed upon the croſs, as the bullock and the ram, were firſt ſlain, and then their bloud was carryed into the moſt holy place.

               <p>The former of theſe, is termed the Church vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, or, The <hi>many called</hi>: the other, is termed the Church inviſible, or, The <hi>few choſen.</hi> The viſible Church Catholick is the whole number of profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Chriſtians thorowout the world, All that in every place call upon the name of Jeſus Chriſt.

               <p>Of the Catholick inviſible Church, Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96773:15"/>
is the onely Head and Lord: but he hath not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted any other in his ſtead, <hi>niſi vicarium ſpiritum ſanctum,</hi> unleſs the Holy Ghoſt. He hath indeed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed officers in the Church viſible; which officers have hitherto uſually been divided into two ſorts: firſt, Temporary &amp; extraordinary; and ſecondly, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, and ordinary: which diviſion, I think, it had been better to retain, than to give us a new one, which will not hold. For certainly the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, did govern outwardly; and as certain it is, that the Biſhops or Elders did teach, and feed the flock of God, for inward growth and helpfulneſs, Acts 20. 28. and 1 Pet. 5. 2.</p>
               <p>It ſhould ſeem that he means here, The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church viſible; for ſuch was the Church he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in Anſw. to Qu. 158. <q rend="margQuotes">A company of men called out of the world, and gathered into the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hip of God.]</q> In this Church indeed our Saviour hath ſet officers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. in which whole cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, the Apoſtle treateth of this kinde of Church: and it is true alſo that Jeſus Chriſt may be ſaid to be Head of this Church, in regard of the Graces of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification, derived from him, for the Offices, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and Government of his Church, and in regard of the common benefits, and common gifts of a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual kinde: and thus is ſaid v. 12. So alſo is Chriſt: where he meaneth, by Chriſt, this Body of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church viſible, of which he is in ſome ſort the Head; and which is, in ſome ſort his Body, and therefore called Chriſt, Though moſt properly he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96773:16"/>
is, as moſt commonly he is ſaid to be, Head onely of that Body, whereof he is alſo the Saviour, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 23. which as his Spouſe, or wife, ſhall live and reign with him for ever in heaven. And I have ſome reaſon to think, that our Catechiſt did not intend, in this place, ſo much to exclude the Biſhop of Rome from being the ſpiritual head of the Chriſtian world; as he did intend to exclude the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, from ruling in a National, or any other particular Church.</p>
               <p>Many years now paſt, that the King of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be called <hi>Head</hi> of the Church, offended the parties of each extremitie: As thoſe of our own were ſorely troubled at it; ſo was it the point or ſting of the charge againſt the <hi>Biſhop of Rocheſter</hi>:&amp; when <hi>Hadr. Junius</hi> was blaſted from <hi>Rome,</hi> for that in the Dedication of his Greek <hi>Lexicon</hi> to <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. he called him Supreme <hi>Head</hi> of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>; he pleaded for himſelf by letters, to the Court of Cardinals, that here with us, to clip the Kings Title, was almoſt as Capital, as to clip his Coin.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, it was thought fit, in the beginning of the Queens Reign, whether to alter it, or explain it, by putting <hi>Governour</hi> in ſtead of <hi>Head.</hi> More, as I ſuppoſe, out of charitable condeſcenſion, then any neceſſity, or harm in the word; inasmuch as the word doth not note any internal efficacy or influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but onely outward regiment; the title or term of [<hi>LORD</hi>] being as liable to exception, both the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96773:16"/>
one and the other ſignifying no more then Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or pre-eminence: and a King or Queen regnant, might as well be called Head of theſe National Churches, as <hi>Saul</hi> was called by <hi>Samuel,</hi> Head of the tribes of Iſrael, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>15. 17. And that argument had with it more fallacy, then civility, which ſome formerly have uſed: <hi>Omnes filii participes, &amp;c.</hi> All that are ſons, are partakers of chaſtiſement or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline: No true, or right-bred ſon that is <hi>extra Diſciplinam</hi>: Therefore the Supreme Magiſtrate being a Chriſtian, muſt be cenſurable as others are, becauſe he is a ſon of the Church. But of what Church is he a ſon? of the Church Catholick he is: but of a particular or local Church, of this or that denomination, he is the Father, not a ſon: nor any member is he, but the Head.

of the doubt raiſed out of his Anſwer to Qu. 160.

               <p>In the mean time, and untill they reform their vein of Allegorizing, I would, with all due reſpect, beſeech him, to forbear his vein of ſcoffing; the which of the two, doth bring the greater prejudice to Religion, and doth more expoſe it to contempt of ſtrangers: as when he calleth his brethren that diſſent from him, <hi>Miniſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </q>
               <p>The brief Inſtruction to be gathered out of theſe Queſtions and Anſwers, is this: that the Law (that is, the Decalogue or ten Commandments) is of good uſe to bring us to Chriſt: but after that we be
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96773:19"/>
brought to him; then his Grace and Spirit be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to direct us, ſo that we ſhall not much need the Law to be a Rule to us, at leaſtwiſe not regard it more than any other piece of Scripture.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer: We have hitherto in our Church been taught, and have learned, that the Decalogue is a Rule directing, and, a Law binding, even juſtified and regenerate Chriſtians, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than it bindeth perſons unregenerate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Artic.</hi> 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the 39. Though the Law given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as touching Ceremonies do not binde Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian men, nor the civil precepts be of neceſſity to be received, yet <hi>no Chriſtian man what ſoever</hi> is free from the obedience of the Commandments which are called Moral. No man, be he never ſo perfect a Chriſtian. So the Articles of K. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſſemblies larger Catechiſme.</hi> The Moral Law is a Declaration of the will of God to mankinde, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting and binding every one, as well perſons rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate as others, to perfect and perpetual conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and obedience thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Congregational Churches</hi> in the Declaration of their Faith chap. 19. § 5, 6. The moral Law doth for ever binde all, as well juſtified perſons as others to the obedience thereof, and is a Rule of life to true beleevers, as well as to others.</p>
               <p>Thus have theſe taught, agreeably to the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſmes and Chriſtian Inſtitutions of other reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches, and writers. For whether they have made the ends and uſes of the Moral Law, fewer,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96773:20"/>
or more; this hath ſtill been one; to be <hi>Norma vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendi,</hi> a Direction to order our life by. We thought, we had attained hitherto, to walk by the ſame Rule, and to be of one minde in this matter, whatſoever our other differences be; And why this Authour ſhould by teaching otherwiſe draw away diſciples af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, let him ſee to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Open door,</hi> Preface. § It's injurious. <q rend="margQuotes">[Many preachers in ſtead of Goſpel-preaching, become teachers of the Law, and jumble Law and Goſpel together: ſo that they neither preach Law nor Goſpel, but a mingle mangle of both, not knowing what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm, talking of Duties to them, who want Principles to perform them rightly]</q> by theſe words of his, it ſhould ſeem, that as the Law, muſt not be a Rule of Duties, to perſons unconverted: ſo it muſt be no Rule at all, to any perſon whatſoever.</p>
               <p>But I prove, that the ten Commandments, even <hi>As given by Moſes,</hi> do oblige juſtified perſons, to the Duties therein enjoyned. Firſt, by Scripture. When Jeſus Chriſt came, he confirmed the Law Moral, Matth. 5. 17. <hi>Think not that I came to deſtroy the Law, I came to fulfill it.</hi> Now that he meant the Law Moral, and that <hi>As given by Moſes,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the following explication of the ſeveral Commandments, verſ.21. and 27, and 33. Matth.22. v. 38,39. He gave the ſum of the firſt and ſecond Table, calling them the firſt and ſecond, the two great Commandments. Moſes gave the Law, in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96773:20"/>
ten Precepts, and two Tables, and as ſo given, Chriſt confirmed it.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles alſo in their Epiſtles, exhort Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to the Duties of the Law, <hi>As given by Moſes</hi>; as well for manner, as matter. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. <hi>He that ſaid, Do not commit adultery, ſaid alſo, Do not kill.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 6. calleth the fifth command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>The firſt commandment with promiſe</hi>; the <hi>firſt,</hi> to wit, of the ſecond Table. <hi>Moſes</hi> gave the Law in ten precepts, and two Tables, and <hi>as ſo given,</hi> the Apoſtles do mention it, and urge the Duties of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I prove by his own words, the Law to be a Rule to them that are in Chriſt. Qu. and Anſw. 197. he ſaith, The firſt lawfull uſe of the Law, is, to ſhew us what is ſin, and to convince us that we do ſin; that is, that the regenerate do ſin, as appears by his Text, 1 <hi>Joh.1.8. If we ſay we have no ſin, &amp;c.</hi> How can the Law ſhew us that we do ſin, but by being a rule againſt which we ſin. Then next he alloweth the Moral Law, to be profitable with all other Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, <hi>to inſtruct, exhort, rebuke, &amp;c.</hi> indeed he doth not ſay, to direct, rule, binde, unleſs theſe be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in his, &amp;c. But if all other Scripture be a <hi>rule</hi> or <hi>Canon</hi> to us, in belief and life, why may not the Decalogue be ſo alſo? or what reaſon can be given, why the Decalogue written in the 20 Chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> ſhould be of uſe above other Scripture to diſcover ſin, and convince men, <hi>Before</hi> Juſtification; and yet after Juſtification, ſhould be of no more uſe, then other Scriptures are, to rule and direct us in our
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96773:21"/>
obedience? for plainly he teacheth in his Anſw. to Qu. 197. (What is the lawfull uſe of the Law?) That for juſtified perſons to uſe the Law as a Rule of obedience, <hi>More</hi> then other parts or places of Scripture, is to uſe it unlawfully.</p>
               <q rend="margQuotes">
                  <p>Qu. 197. he faith, The Law ſheweth what we may expect to be effected in us, by the Grace of Chriſt: and to that Qu. Oughteſt thou not to walk in the obſervation of the ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? the Anſwer is, In acting forth faith and love we keep the Commandments, becauſe in walking after the Spirit, the righteouſneſs of the Law is fulfilled in us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 4.</p>
               </q>
               <p>I anſwer, Firſt, that place now named, I beleeve, he miſunderſtandeth: for he taketh it to be meant of Sanctification, whereas, moſt probably it is meant of the righteouſneſs of Juſtification, as is evident by conferring the fourth verſe with the firſt, being both of the ſame import.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whatſoever the teacher intends to ſow, the ſcholar may likely pick up here, a ſeed of Enthuſiaſime: for, if walking in the Spirit, and grace of Chriſt, and Acting forth faith and love, do bring a <hi>Superſedeas</hi> to the ten Commandments; then why not to all the Scripture as well? why may not the written word in general be thought needleſs to teach us our duties, or minde us of Comfort, Reproof, or Inſtruction? ſince this may be as well ſupplied in us, as the righteouſneſs of the Law is fulfilled in us,</p>
               <p>by walking after the Spirit. But the Spirit of God
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96773:21"/>
directs us by the word, not diſcharging it, but cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing us to underſtand, beleeve, embrace, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas he produceth that text in the margin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> to prove that if we act forth love, we ſhall not much need to walk in the obſervation of the Decalogue. I ſhall now endeavour to ſhew his miſtake.</p>
               <p>To fulfill, is taken two ways; Firſt, to perform perfectly: <hi>To fulfill all righteouſneſs, Matth.</hi> 3. <hi>To fulfill the Miniſtery, Coloſſ.</hi> 4. And thus the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was fulfilled, while the Prieſts, Levites, and people, performed the rites and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances which were enjoyned them. Secondly, to bring to an end, iſſue, or event. So Predictions and Propheſies, Types and Figures, are ſaid to be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, when the things are come to paſs, which thoſe did foreſignifie: So <hi>the Scripture was fulfilled which ſaith, He was numbred with the tranſgreſſours</hi>: and thus the Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was <hi>fulfilled,</hi> when Chriſt came and died for us, and put an end to it.</p>
               <p>Now of theſe two ſignifications of the word [<hi>fulfill</hi>] in this ſentence [<hi>Love fulfilleth the Law</hi>] he ſeemeth to take it in the latter ſenſe, as if it were ſaid, The Spirit of God and Grace of Charity, hath made the Law out of Date, and put a final period to it; ſo that now it is not to be regarded any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than the propheſies and ſhadows which have accompliſhment in Chriſt: whereas the word <hi>fulfill,</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:96773:22"/>
is not to be taken in this ſenſe, but in the former. And yet if he doth take the word, <hi>fulfill,</hi> in the former ſenſe, namely <hi>perfectly to perform,</hi> as the word is taken there, (underſtanding the while, perfection of parts, not of degrees) then, he is miſtaken in thinking that love fulfills the Law <hi>per actus elicitos,</hi> doing it ſelf all that is required, whereas it doth not fulfill the Law otherwiſe than <hi>per actus imperatos,</hi> by ſetting others, other faculties and graces on work. The Sun giveth light to the world, <hi>per actum elici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>; it bringeth forth flowers and fruits, <hi>per actum imperatum.</hi> Love cauſeth us to be well and kindly affected, this is the own and proper work of it: but over and above, it layes a command upon us to be ſerviceable in ſeveral Duties. Love is not the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Law by elicit actions (for fear and truſt, are required moreover in the firſt Table; upright dealing and mercifulneſs in the ſecond) if it were, it ſhould indeed bring ſome diſcharge to the Law; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſhould contain in it ſelf, all the ſeveral parcels of the Law: But becauſe it doth fulfill the Law onely, by exciting us, or ſetting us on work, to do the ſeveral duties enjoyned, therefore it is needfull, nevertheleſs, that the Law ſhould ſtill abide in place and force, that we may know what the particulars are that God requireth of us, and that we may do them out of obedience to his will, who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth theſe particulars to be done.</p>
               <p>And certainly, Love is not more, a fulfilling of the Law, after that Chriſt is come, then it was before his
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:96773:22"/>
coming: for to love God above all, was ever the ſum of the firſt Table: and to love our Neighbour as our ſelf, was always the ſum of the ſecond Table: and howſoever meant, the meaning was ever the ſame: and as much did charity put an end to the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, in the Old Teſtament, as it doth in the New.</p>
               <p>One chief place of Scripture, by occaſion of which, and by following the ſound of it more than ſeeking after the ſenſe of it, he is miſ-led, and miſ-leadeth others, is that which he quoteth to the Qu. 167. of <hi>the Law</hi> being <hi>a ſchoolmaſter to Chriſt</hi>: which text, as ſome others alſo do, he miſ-underſtands thorowout. For firſt by the Law, they mean the Moral, or ten Commandments; whereas indeed it meaneth the Law Ceremonial, <hi>chiefly,</hi> if not <hi>onely,</hi> which hath as much of the Goſpel in it, as of the Law; the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rites and Ceremonies, being but <hi>appendices Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelii,</hi> annexed to the Doctrine of the Goſpel, then, though ſomewhat darkly, revealed. That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle means this, and not the Law Moral, conſidered, as a Covenant of works, holding nothing for the preſent of a Saviour, appears by the ſcope of the Apoſtle to the Galatians; which is againſt them, that would have circumciſion, and all the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of <hi>Moſes</hi> retained in the time of the Goſpel, as neceſſary to our Juſtification in Chriſt: the very ſame opinion, that beginning at <hi>Antioch,</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles condemned at <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> 15. The er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the beleeving Phariſees was not, that it was needfull to be circumciſed, and to keep the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96773:23"/>
but to be circumciſed, and keep the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> namely, that Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was of the ſame kinde with circumciſion, which properly is the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi>; the law <hi>Moral,</hi> being the Law of Nature, written in mans heart before, and by <hi>Moſes</hi> miniſtery written out fair, in Tables of ſtone. Yet is it true that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in that Epiſtle againſt the Moral Law, ſo far as it was ſuppoſed to juſtifie us: but this he doth by way of argument againſt his adverſaries; and not as if he made the cauſe of the Moral Law, and Ceremonial, all alike, in reſpect of retaining, or not retaining them; his way of arguing being, <hi>à genere ad ſpeciem negativé.</hi> We are not juſtified by the Law, any Law whatſoever; therefore not by the Law Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial.</p>
               <p>And as our Authour miſtakes the term [<hi>Law</hi>] here; ſo doth he alſo in the fourth lawfull uſe of the Law, which is to witneſs to Chriſt, quoting <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21. where it is ſaid, that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is witneſſed by the Law and the Prophets. Where the Law, ſignifies the Books of the Law, not the ten Commandments. In the promiſe made to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, Gen</hi> 3. to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 12. is teſtimony given to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his grace, and in all thoſe places where <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote of him. The Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, being the ſame in that place, that <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 22. <hi>Moſes</hi> in his five books wrote of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo did the Prophets.</p>
               <p>So for the Law. The word <hi>Schoolmaſter</hi> miſtaken,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:96773:23"/>
helpeth to deceive them further: for upon hearing of that, they preſently imagine great rigour, and hard uſage to be intended: they think of nothing but ſtripes and ſcourges, and ruling with a wooden ſceptre, as if he muſt needs be an <hi>Orbilius plagoſus,</hi> ſuch a one as <hi>Fr. Junius</hi> met withall, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of ſo much in his life: <hi>Corpus ſuum exercitavit in corpore meo</hi>: whereas the beſt authours that treat of teaching young ſcholars, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Quinti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> will not allow of ſtriking of them. But be it as it may, for that: <hi>Paedagogus,</hi> howſoever through penury of words we be forced to turn it, is, <hi>Formator morum</hi>: ſuch a one as was allowed and appointed to wait on great mens ſons and heirs apparent, and to teach them how to behave themſelves; and to frame their pliable and waxen age, to love of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and practiſe of vertue, and deteſtation of vice, to faſhion them betimes, ſo far as might be, for what they were to be another day. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſo calls it <hi>Conſtantine Manaſſes,</hi> ſpeaking of him that was Pedagogue to the Emperour <hi>Auguſtus</hi>: he did ſet him in right tune for his carriage, and made his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour congruous to himſelf, ſo great a Perſonage. Thus <hi>Cyrus</hi> had one who taught him before-hand, not to reſpect: perſons in matters of Juſtice, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving him for that he would have adjudged a coat, that was in queſtion, not to the true owner, but to another whom it beſt fitted. And <hi>Iulian</hi> in his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopogon,</hi> checks the ſoft and effeminate people of <hi>Antioch</hi> by his own education, which was no way
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96773:24"/>
ſuitable to them: My Pedagogue, ſaith he, taught me, when I went into the Theatre, to look upon the ground; he would have him caſt his eyes downward; not look up, upon the wanton and laſcivious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects there preſented to ſpectatours.</p>
               <p>His office likewiſe was, to accompany his young maſter, when he went abroad, or from home: Thus the famous <hi>Cato,</hi> the latter of the two, and the laſt of the Romanes, aged fourteen, when upon a viſit he went to <hi>Sylla,</hi> being then at the height of his tyrannies; and ſaw the heads of the proſcribed lye by heaps at the gate of his Palace; had a Pedagogue attending on him: and well it was he had ſo; for he talked ſo deſperately upon their return, that (as my Authour ſaith, <hi>ſemper poſtea adduxit excuſſum)</hi> when ever after they were to go thither, care was taken that he might be ſearched left the fierce youth ſhould bear any thing about him, that might carry danger with it.</p>
               <p>Yea, more than all this, the Pedagogue, did wait upon this his charge, when he went to ſchool, to learn letters and literature: <hi>Barthius Adverſ.</hi> 21. 1. <hi>Paedagogi ſequebantur pueros heriles literis operam daturos</hi>: and <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith that the Pedagogue, is not contrary to the Maſter (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) but joyns with him in the work, and prepares the ſcholar to take the leſſons that are to be taught him: Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly diſtinguiſhing him from a Schoolmaſter, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the common and vulgar notion. So our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, with many others, miſtakes the ſecond term, in, <hi>lex Paedagogus noſter.</hi>

                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:96773:24"/>Thirdly, they miſtake as much, and as ill, the word <hi>noſter</hi>; for, the [<hi>Nos</hi>] included in that Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, they take tor particular Chriſtians now living, and for ſuch as ſhall hereafter live in the Church of God. Anſwer. to Qu. 167. <q rend="margQuotes">The law was given for a Schoolmaſter to tutour men to Chriſt]</q> men, indefinitely, and indifferently; meaning to humble unconverted Chriſtians in a ſenſe of their ſins, till ſuch time as they have attained peace and pardon, and then the Law hath done the work belonging to it; when they have attained faith, they are no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er under ſuch a maſter. Whereas the Apoſtle doth not ſpeak of particular perſons, nor of the differing condition and eſtate of a man before his converſion and after; Although it be true that the work of the Law, is needfull to prepare for Juſtification through Chriſt Jeſus, and a diſtreſſed conſcience makes way for ſaving grace and ſpiritual comfort; yet that is not it, which the Apoſtle teacheth there; he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth compariſon (not between two ſeveral eſtates of the ſame perſon) but between two ſeveral people. He compareth the Judaical Church, and the Chriſtian Church; and conſidering them both together, as a congregative body, or one entire perſon, he ſpeaks of the ſeveral ages of that Body or Perſon. The Church of God under the old Teſtament was a Childe, or Heir in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noritie: But the Chriſtian Church in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, is as a man grown up, or of full age: as if he had thus ſaid: We the Jews were under the law of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:96773:25"/>
Ceremonies, and circumciſion, but now we are no longer ſo. For neither doth he ſay, in the preſent time, The Law <hi>is,</hi> but it <hi>was,</hi> heretofore a School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter to Chriſt. And laſtly, they miſ-underſtand the word Chriſt, in this ſentence, The Law is a Schoolmaſter to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For they take <hi>Chriſt</hi> here for a <hi>Saviour,</hi> at large: as <hi>faith,</hi> in the next verſe Gal. 3. 25. for <hi>juſtifying</hi> faith, or faith in a Saviour: whereas <hi>Chriſt</hi> here ſignifyeth, <hi>Chriſt revealed,</hi> or manifeſted in the times of the Goſpel, as chap. 2. verſe 4. <hi>Our libertie which we have in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and chap. 6. verſ. 15. <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus neither circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion availeth, nor uncircumciſiſon</hi>: in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, it was ſomething, now it is nothing. And <hi>Faith</hi> in the place now named, [<hi>after that faith is come</hi>] meaneth <hi>Tempus Evangelii,</hi> the Goſpel, or Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt</hi> exhibited in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Whereas therefore, they take the meaning of theſe two verſes to be this; (Gal. 3. 24, 25.) The Moral Law, ſhewing what God requireth of us, and what the curſe is, that is due to the breach of it; driveth us to Chriſt, and forceth us to ſeek a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: but after we be jaſtified by faith in Chriſt, we are no longer under that Law; the Apoſtle ſaith not ſo: but this it amounteth to, which he ſaith: The Ceremonial law under which ye would ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, was but to train you up, and prepare you for the full manifeſtation of Chriſt incarnate, and now when Chriſt Jeſus is come, the Church of God hath no more need of ſhadows and Ceremonies:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:96773:25"/>
their work is done, and we are freed from being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them any longer.</p>
               <p>That this is the meaning of the words, and that S. <hi>Paul,</hi> by being under a Schoolmaſter, meaneth not. Being under the ſpirit of bondage, (as ſome call it) and that he ſpeaks not of Chriſtian liberty, from the curſe of the Moral Law, but onely from the burden of the Ceremonial law, is evident by that which follows in the fourth chapter. For they who were under this Schoolmaſter, whoſoever they were, were the mean while heirs or children, not ſervants, although in ſome regards not much diſtant from ſervants. A ſervant knoweth not what his lord doth: A ſervant knoweth as much as the heir doth, before he be of age, being kept in ignorance, little acquainted with his fathers minde, yet he knoweth that his father loves him, and will make him inheritour of his eſtate. But they who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the malediction of the Moral Law, know not thus much, know not ſo much as this comes to; neither are they heirs, or lords of all.</p>
               <p>The Jews, whiles under this Schoolmaſter, were children; after Chriſt came, they were ſons: they were ſons before, but how? <hi>naturâ, non libertate,</hi> ſons in their minority, and under tutelage. They were made partakers of Chriſt, but not of Chriſt fully manifeſted. So that the Apoſtle maketh op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, betwixt theſe two, <hi>Children,</hi> and <hi>Sons,</hi> by ſons underſtanding <hi>adulti,</hi> men of age. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of which words in the Apoſtles text chap. 3.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96773:26"/>
verſ. 26. and chap. 4. verſ. 1, 6. is not obſerved ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly in ſome tranſlations; though in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers it be: and among the former, Ours is. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Alex. Paedag.</hi> 1. 6. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, when he called them <hi>Sons,</hi> he meant they were men, to diſtinguiſh them from infants or little ones under the Law. So then there is nothing ſpoken by St Paul here, that giveth countenance to them that make void the force of the Decalogue to beleeving Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: and though our Authour in expounding of the words, goes not alone; yet approved writers never go ſo far, as to teach that when a Chriſtian hath attained faith, he is no longer under the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of the Moral Law, though they teach he is no longer under the malediction of it.</p>

both the Miniſter to deliver, and the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants to receive, the Euchariſt, if they be not under Church-cenſures, though they be not as yet endued with juſtifying faith, or ſaving grace; Otherwiſe, if competency of knowledge, and freedome from ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, without convincing ſignes of regeneration, be not ſufficient; it would follow, that the Sacraments ſhould be, in their own nature intended, as badges or marks of difference, not betwixt Chriſtians and Pagans, a Church, and no Church; but betwixt hypocrites and true beleevers: the converted, and the non-converted: and ſhould ſerve to ſeparate the Church viſible, from the Inviſible: and the Lords Supper ſhould be as a fan to ſever the wheat from the chaff: which to do is a work belonging to the laſt day, both generally, and reſpectively.</p>
               <p>But that <hi>Profeſſours</hi> ſhould be appointed to break bread, this hath with it ſome umbrage and ſuſpicion.

               <p>The controverſie is not, Whether Chriſt did die for all, or no: but how, and in what ſenſe, it is ſo ſaid. There be many places of holy Scripture, and many arguments, not eaſily ſolved; becauſe, as I think, inſoluble; which are brought to prove, that Jeſus Chriſt did ſuffer death for all men: But when it is alſo ſaid, that he died for his ſheep; and for his Church; and that for whom God delivered up his ſon, to them he giveth all things; and when his
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96773:29"/>
Death, Reſurrection, and Interceſſion, do as in a chain, one draw the other, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. And when it is certain, that God doth not give all things to all men, as namely, not Faith and Repentance; we are of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity put upon it to diſtinguiſh: which we do ſo as to ſatisfie our ſelves; yet finding withall, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is fed with a fire that is unquenchable.</p>
               <p>We beleeve, as our Church hath made profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and taught us, that the Son of God did offer a full, perfect, and ſufficient oblation and ſatisfaction. for the ſins of the whole world, and that he died for every man. And although notice of this be not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to every man, or all the world; yet may it be given, and truly declared to them.</p>
               <p>Such love did God bear to Humane nature, or all mankinde, more than to the lapſed Angels; that there was, and is a poſſibility for every man whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to be ſaved, though he do not perform the Law, or Covenant of works. Gods juſtice is ſo far ſatisfied, that way is made for mercy, pardon, and favour. Nevertheleſs, for the actual participation of benefit by Chriſts Death, and application to each particular perſon, there is more to be done, than what is done by Chriſt for all the world. The fruit of his paſſion, as to life eternal, is derived onely to his body myſtical, to ſuch as are more nearly united to him, than by the common Relation, or kin, or claim of humane nature, which he took upon him, and for which he ſuffered. And although by his bloud he obtained, as well Univerſal, as eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96773:29"/>
yet by Faith in his bloud are we juſtified. And he who is ſaid to be the Saviour of <hi>all men,</hi> is ſaid alſo to be the Saviour of <hi>his Body</hi>; that is, of ſuch as partake of his Spirit, and are ſubject to him, and joyned to him, as the parts of the Body are to the Head: So all men are not.</p>
               <p>In this Nation at ſome eſpeciall times, comes forth a General Pardon: in which caſe though we ſet aſide the Exceptions, or the excepted; Thoſe perſons to whom it is really and truely intended, muſt ſue out their pardon: otherwiſe, they may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed not to accept of it. And if then, any ſhall urge the Term, and Title of the General Pardon, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, without end upon this, That a pardon it is, and ſuch a pardon as is general to all the people, without taking notice of any thing elſe further to be done; he that hath but ſmall skill, can eaſily ſee, how weak ſuch kinde of reaſoning is.</p>
               <p>Now whereas Faith is Gods gift, and he beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Spirit where he will, and man cannot beleeve of himſelf, nor perform the condition required; here beginneth the firſt overture of that ſecret difference that is betwixt man and man: and here firſt openeth it ſelf, the great myſtery of <hi>Election,</hi> in that the Ranſom, or Satisfaction which God hath accepted, as general, and ſufficient for all men, that <hi>whoſoever beleeveth ſhould not periſh</hi>; doth not actually, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaciouſly, profit all men to life eternal, becauſe to all men it is not given, to beleeve and perform the condition.</p>

               <p>The death of Chriſt was <hi>for all,</hi> but not <hi>for all alike,</hi> or in the ſame manner, or with the like iſſue &amp; event. He gave himſelf, and ſuffered ſufficiently, with <hi>a general Intention for all</hi>; but efficaciouſly, with <hi>a ſpecial Intention, for ſome onely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we ſay <hi>ſufficiently,</hi> we do not mean a mere or bare ſufficiency, as if there were onely price and worth enough in Chriſts bloud, to redeem all. As a rich man may have money enough in his cheſt, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all the poor in the Town: But we mean a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency with promiſe and proffer of benefit for all, yet not without a condition to be performed: As when a rich man doth give ſuch a ſum of money, to be by dole diſtributed to all the poor of that Town where he liveth: provided that they orderly attend at ſuch a time and place to receive it. The Gift is intended for them all. But ſome it may be, had no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it: and perhaps ſome others have no minde to take it. Yet were the alms intended for them all, and to each of them who did abſent themſelves, it may be truly ſaid, Had you waited as was appointed, you had received your dole. But ſo it cannot truely be ſaid to ſuch poor, as live in diſtant places, becauſe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96773:30"/>
it was not intended, nor provided for them.</p>
               <p>There is no poſſibility for Satan and his angels to be ſaved by the death of Chriſt, not onely becauſe their nature was not aſſumed, but becauſe Chriſts death in the purpoſe of God, was not ordained for them, as it was for mankind. This Propoſition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore [<hi>If Satan beleeve, he ſhall be ſaved</hi>] is not true, becauſe Chriſt died not for him. But this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion [<hi>If Judas Iſcariot beleeve, he ſhall be ſaved, was true, becauſe Chriſt died for him.</hi>

               <p>A favourite may procure a place at Court, for his friend in the Countrey; who nevertheleſs doth chooſe to live retiredly, and in the ſhadow, rather then in the view and glory of the world: the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the mean time being ready for him, intended for him, and proffered him.</p>
               <p>And that in this ſenſe, our Bleſſed Saviour did ſuffer death for <hi>all men</hi>: as our Church hath framed the Anſwer; <hi>Jeſus Chriſt redeemed me and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> may be proved out of thoſe words, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 23. <hi>This is his Commandment, that we ſhould beleeve in the name of his Son.</hi> There is not onely a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> or Commiſſion to the Apoſtles, <hi>to preach</hi> the Goſpel to every Creature: But a <hi>Command alſo</hi> to every one that hears it, <hi>to beleeve it.</hi> Now, firſt, God doth not command any thing to be beleeved that is not true: and whoſoever beleeveth in the Son of God, muſt beleeve, this at the leaſt, that he died for him; therefore God commandeth every man that heareth the Goſpel, to beleeve that the Son of God
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96773:31"/>
died for him. Now whatſoever I beleeve, is not therefore true becauſe I beleeve it; but it muſt be true before it be beleeved: ſo for all thoſe that are commanded to beleeve, did Chriſt ſuffer Death, and offer Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>And if any man ſhall hold on the contrary, that Faith doth not conſiſt in beleeving this or that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, as, Jeſus Chriſt gave himſelf for me; but in laying hold on, and apprehending and receiving Chriſt a Saviour, and that this is the right object of that kind of Faith, which is given in command to every one that heareth the Goſpel; Then I argue, ſecondly thus: God doth not command any thing that is impoſſible. I mean not, that is impoſſible to ſuch a perſon as now he is, and at ſuch a time; but that is impoſſible in it ſelf to be done. But now it is a thing not poſſible or any way feaſable, for me to lay hold on Chriſt a Saviour, unleſs he be ordained and appointed a Saviour for me: and this cannot be, but by Gods appointment and inſtitution, ſetting him forth to be a common Sacrifice and propitiation: thus it is in life ſpiritual, even as in corporal life, and the courſe of nature, it is impoſſible to be fed and nouriſhed by a ſtone, becauſe it never was ordained of God for food. Therefore Jeſus Chriſt did give himſelf a Sacrifice for all men that hear the Goſpel: and as for them who never heard of him, he offered Sacrifice for their ſins alſo: and whoſoever ſhall go and tell them ſo, ſhall tell them but the truth. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, untill they hear it, they do not ſin, in not
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:96773:31"/>
beleeving it; as they do, who hear, and beleeve not. So much for the general intention, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Chriſts Death for all men.</p>
               <p>But as there is this general Redemption, by means of that one Sacrifice for all men; ſo there is proper to thoſe who are choſen to life, A ſpecial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; which, as it proceeds from Election, Eph. 1.4. ſo it conſiſts in actual forgiveneſs of ſins, v.7. <hi>in whom we have Redemption, the forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi> All men are no where ſaid to be <hi>elected,</hi> All men are no where ſaid to be <hi>forgiven.</hi> So ſome Redemption belongs to all; but, not every kinde of Redemption.</p>
               <p>And that the intention of benefit by Chriſts Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, was not alike to all, on his part; but more to ſome than to others; appeareth hence, that there was not the like application of it, made by him to all. He who offered himſelf a Sacrifice for the ſins of all men, yet did pray for ſome onely, Joh. 17. 9. And God who gave his ſon, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth in him, ſhould not periſh, did abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that the benefit of that promiſe ſhould infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly take place, in ſome, by removing that infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which might have hindred them, and by giving faith which enabled them, to perform the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and lay hold on the promiſe, for want of which faith, others are loſt. If in time, and in execution, he dealeth not alike the fruit of Chriſts Death to all men; then may we ſafely gather, that his purpoſe and intention, touching the fruit of Chriſts Death
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96773:32"/>
was not alike to all men. <hi>Executio eſt ſpeculum De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creti,</hi> we may ſafely behold and view, Gods purpoſe and determination, in what he doth in time effect and bring to paſs.</p>
               <p>And if any man ſhall now murmure within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and ſay: I know not whether I be of that ſele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted number, for whom Chriſts Death was intended to be actually &amp; every way efficacious; nor whether Gods love and good will be as much to me, as it is to any other, and ſhall thereupon neglect the duties of Gods law, and the means of his own eternal ſafety, giving ear to the whiſpers of ſome falſe teachers, by whom he is encouraged ſo to do, or at leaſtwiſe excuſed for ſo doing, rather than liſtening to the grave and wholſome advice, of our Church-Articles; which is, To receive Gods promiſes, in ſuch wiſe, as they be generally ſet forth in holy Scriptures; I ſhall onely deſire him to call to minde that ſaying of <hi>Moſes</hi> Deut. 29. <hi>Secret things belong to the Lord, our God; but things revealed belong to us.</hi> In which words the Man of God ſetteth bounds to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and to our ſearch, as once he did to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at the foot of the mount, that they might know their diſtance and keep it, and not at their utmoſt peril, break thorow, ani gaze. And whoſoever he be that ſhall refuſe, to entertain and embrace points of belief, and the Doctrine of godlineſs fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed; and in the mean time buſily intermeddle with ſecrets reſerved; ſhall add to diſobedience, the ſacriledge of curioſity, and may fear that God will

               <p>The Brief of theſe Inſtructions is this:</p>
               <p>All ſin, and ſins whatſoever; Original and Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; of all men whomſoever, whether they repent of thoſe ſins or not, do obtain at Gods hand for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs as due debt, by means and vertue of Chriſts ſatisfaction; thoſe ſins excepted which are againſt the Goſpel; and Chriſt coming a light into the world, yet theſe may be forgiven too, if they be repented of, becauſe Chriſts gift for Juſtification ſuperaboundeth for the forgiveneſs of more ſins than Adams tranſgreſſion brought upon us.</p>
               <p>An accuſation that is found to be falſe, rebound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with greater force upon him that brought it: I will not charge the Catechiſt with this opinion now ſet down by me. It is charitable to think, he wrote here, he could not well tell what: but I do charge
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96773:33"/>
his words, his Queſtions and Anſwers with the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection aboveſaid.</p>
               <p>The worſt of Pagans, may claim, it ſeems, as due debt, the pardon of their moſt atrocious crimes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe are ſins, that Adams ſin brought upon them, Anſw. 97. that Chriſt found upon them, Anſw. 99] Original ſin produceth, or bringeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, all actual ſins, as the root produceth the fruit. The greateſt ſins of all, thoſe by the Apoſtle enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated, Rom. 1. Sins againſt the law of nature, ſins ripe to judgement, filled in meaſure and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning over: ſuch as for number, and greatneſs, and multiplication, follow one another till they reach to heaven, Revel. 18.5. theſe all, if they be but againſt the Law of nature, and not againſt the Grace of Chriſt, claim pardon, as due debt, firſt, without <hi>asking</hi> pardon, (it is but juſt, and juſt it is, to give, or pay due debt, though it be not demanded.) ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly without <hi>Repentance</hi>: indeed for ſins againſt Chriſts Mediation, there is a Condition or Proviſo, that they be repented of: but none at all for other ſins, they are forgiven abſolutely, without further ſuit or ſervice. So that according to this Doctrine, it is far better, to hold of the firſt Adam, as our Head, and as our Root, than to hold of the ſecond, or to hear of him: For, by the firſt Adam, and the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge procured for him, we are clear of our old debts, and by means of the ſecond, we contract new.</p>
               <p>If any ſhall ſay, to ſalve his words, from this
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:96773:34"/>
worſe than heatheniſh Divinity, that whereas he ſpeaks Anſw. 96. of ſinning againſt Chriſts Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, he may haply mean that Mediation, which the works of Creation do ſpeak, according to his Inſtructions Qu. and Anſw. 152, 153. and that thus all hainous ſins againſt the law of nature, may be ſaid to be againſt the Grace of Chriſt; and thus the Sodomites might be ſaid, to ſin againſt Chriſts Mediation, obſcurely intimated in that God gave them a pleaſant countrey, and cauſed the ſun to riſe upon their city: To this I <hi>anſwer,</hi> He cannot mean the Mediation and Grace made known by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but muſt mean the Mediation made known by Chriſts Incarnation, becauſe <hi>Anſw.</hi> 97. he ſaith Chriſts Death was a Ranſome for thoſe ſins that were upon us <hi>Before,</hi> and conſidered <hi>Without,</hi> Chriſts coming a light into the world: now I think Chriſts coming, cannot poſsibly be underſtood otherwiſe, than of his coming in the fleſh; and Anſw. 96. <hi>He here-through coming</hi>: that is, by his Death, as is plain by the Queſtion. And howſoever, there weit no ſins before God did ſpeak his goodneſs, in the heavens and works of Creation, or that can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered without Chriſts Mediation ſuppoſed to be ſhown in temporal bleſſings. So that the ſenſe which the words yeeld, cannot be, but as is ſaid.</p>
               <p>There be ſome opinions, if they be fit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed in Chriſtian ears; need nothing but their mere rehearſal for their confutation, for their dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation. I love not to rake in this worſe than Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian

puddle, where the Preaching of the Goſpel is ſo far from being made a benefit or a bleſſing upon a People, that Chriſtians, and none but Chriſtians thorowout the world, are capable of being caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way or periſhing. But for his Pelagian Crambe (I call it ſo, as by him urged) of the Univerſal par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle [<hi>All</hi>] he hath alledged two texts. One, Rom. 5. 18. <hi>By the righteouſneſs of one the free gift came upon all men, to juſtification</hi>: the other 1 Cor. 15.22. (for I take that verſe and not the 21 to be meant, as being the parallel place). <hi>In chriſt ſhall all be made alive</hi>: concerning this laſt place, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the 21, or 22, or both, ſomewhat is to be premiſed, becauſe it may be diverſly underſtood. I think it is to be taken of a glorious vivification, or Reſurrection to life: for this properly is a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: and of this onely is treated, in that whole chapter; for the wicked or caſt-aways ſhall ariſe, not by efficacy of Chriſt the Saviour, but by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of God the Judge: for being by him, ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to Death, they muſt come forth of priſon to be led to execution: That Reſurrection, which is a priviledge of the holy Catholick Church, in the Apoſtles Creed: That which is ſpoken of Luke 20. 36. <hi>children of God, being children of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; is that ſpoken of in this chapter: alſo in 1 Theſſ. 4. the comfort of Gods people being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended both there, and here.</p>
               <p>Now for the Texts brought to prove, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of mens ſins, that were brought upon
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96773:35"/>
them by Adam, to be <hi>Due Debt,</hi> I anſwer, he might have looked within a few verſes of his ſecond text, and thus have read: [<hi>But when he ſaith all things, it is manifeſt that he is excepted, &amp;c.</hi>] In ſome uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſals, there be manifeſt exceptions: and in every univerſal, there is reſtriction to the ſubject matter, or that which for the preſent is ſpoken of: he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth us ſomewhere, with <hi>broad denial</hi> of Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayings. Not ſo: but it is the <hi>Denial of the broad ſenſe</hi> of ſome Scripture-ſayings, this we own and acknowledge. All things that are ſaid in Scripture, or any where elſe, are not to be taken in the full latitude. <hi>Divinâ gratiâ opus eſt,</hi> ſaith St <hi>Chryſoſtom.

Gods word is written for them that are awake, and have underſtanding, and make uſe of it, when they read, But for thoſe two places he needed not to have looked far, to finde a limitation of the univerſal particle <hi>all</hi>: for Rom. 5.18. it is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited in the very next verſe, verſ. 17. <hi>recipientibus,</hi> to them that receive the abundance ot Grace.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:96773:35"/>
Death ſhould be properly, for the pardon of the former, and not of the other, I can no where finde; nor do I acknowledge any ground for it. St <hi>John</hi> telleth us, that the bloud of Jeſus <hi>Chriſt,</hi> cleanſeth us from <hi>all</hi> ſin: and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when he was come a light into the world, was nevertheleſs made a <hi>pattern</hi> to thoſe that ſhould afterwards believe, 1 Tim. 1.16. if he who fiercely perſecuted <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> be made of God a Pattern and Precedent to others, of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Death; ſurely then was Chriſts Death as proper for him, as for others; and as proper for them that ſin as he did, as for him. They who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of Chriſt are commanded to repent; Act. 17.30. as well as they who crucified the Lord of life, Act. 2. 38. Chriſt died for both, and both muſt repent, and neither of them can claim for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of <hi>due debt,</hi> without Repentance.</p>
               <p>M <hi>H.</hi> talks much, and unſeaſonably enough of the extent of Chriſts Death; and makes it almoſt an unpardonable crime, to limit it to Gods elect, or them that ſhall be ſaved: But who ever made ſo odious a reſtraint of it, as he hath here made? as if it were not properly and abſolutely a Ranſome, for any perſon this day in <hi>England,</hi> or yet in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome; for all the ſins of Chriſtians muſt needs be againſt the light of the Goſpel, <hi>their</hi> ſins cannot be conſidered <hi>before,</hi> or <hi>without</hi> Chriſts coming. One text he alledgeth, but depraveth it, that it may ſerve his purpoſe, Rom. 5.16,17. <hi>The judgement</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:96773:36"/>
                  <hi>was by one to condemnation; but the free gift is of many offences to juſtification,</hi> therefore Chriſts Death was properly for thoſe ſins he found upon us, for thoſe ſins, which were brought upon us by Adam; but for no other ſins properly and abſolutely. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the ſuperabundance of Chriſts Grace, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Repentance, ſhall be forgiven more ſins than ever came by Adam: as if infidelity, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt the light of the Goſpel, and refuſing to be ſaved, and love of darkneſs more than light; were not found upon us by means of Adams tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. And ſecondly I <hi>anſwer,</hi> the meaning of the Apoſtles words is this. The firſt Adams ſin was but one: but when the ſecond Adam cometh, doth he onely take away that one ſin? not ſo: he doth ſet us free from many offences; that is, from the multitude of offences or actual ſins committed by us: Now S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not diſtinguiſh of thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny offences, (and why ſhould any other then?) but would be taken to mean all kinde of offences, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſidered before, and without Chriſts co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; or elſe proceeding out of love of darkneſs, when his coming is made known. From all kinde of actual ſins, properly and intentionally, though not abſolutely without Repentance, Chriſts off-ſpring or children are diſcharged, through Chriſt their Head and Father.</p>

Should any man take ſuch libertie as to imitate him, he might reduce not the Incarnation onely, but moſt of the Articles of the Creed, and moſt of the works of God, to Election. And even this great Myſtery of the Incarnation, which appertained not to this place, he hath expreſſed very untowardly. Had he been ſo wary as to keep himſelf to the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed, he had not uſed thoſe words of God choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the man Jeſus Chriſt to be united with the word, but of Chriſt aſſuming the manhood into God, or to the Eternal word.

fairly, thus to aggravate a miſtake of this kinde, where no harm is intended, but all is meant well, as I am willing to acknowledge out of his own words elſewhere, I ſhall alledge that for my ſelf, which is to be found, if I miſtake not, and is obſerved in the Civil Law, and as I think, in our Laws too: <hi>Res illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cita &amp; jocularia, caſum reddit atrociorem.</hi> He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeriouſly employed in his honeſt calling, or any lawfull action, doth by way of miſ-adventure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſome danger or damage, to his neighbours goods, or life, or limb; ſhall not incur the ſame guilt, nor draw upon himſelf the ſame puniſhment, that another ſhall, who doth the very ſame harm, whiles he is either in ſport and idle, or elſe bent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome other miſchief. Our Authour was medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating a Mock-anſwer to a ſerious Queſtion, and ſtudying how to elude, and evade, and make void, Gods Election of particular perſons: to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe wreſting both the word of God, and the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of Faith: a bad intent, an ill deſigne and work; in proſecution of which, while he ſtumbled upon an old condemned hereſie, the blame of what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell him, may with right and reaſon reſt upon him.</p>
               <p>After the prime and principal part of his Anſwer, followeth ſomething touching what is mentioned in the Queſtion; (the other I called a Mock-Anſwer) but in ſuch a manner, as if he were afraid of being guilty of following his Elders Tradition, or of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering what he hath received of our Church, affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:96773:38"/>
to be wiſer then his Teachers, who yet have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered nothing, but what they have received of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. This may appear by theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> whereas he ſaith, [<hi>choſe, or purpoſed to chooſe</hi>] I do miſ-doubt his disjunctive, as tending to overthrow all precedaneous Election. In Copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, both muſt be true, to make the propoſition true: but in Disjunctives, it is enough, if one of them hold true; and it is likely that with ſome of his partners, he will betake himſelf, if need be, to the ſole <hi>purpoſe</hi> or <hi>intention</hi> to Elect. So abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cautelous he is, that there ſhould be no Election whatſoever, <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> though it be but ſuch, as one would think, might very ſafely have been yeelded. <hi>open door,</hi> Preface. <q rend="margQuotes">[That any uncalled, are ever called Elect, I can no where finde in Scripture,]</q> In what terms would he have it delivered that he might ſay, Now have I found it? There are Elect from the beginning; Elect before the foundation of the world: therefore as yet uncalled: he may finde Election placed before Vocation, in that chain, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>When as they hear the Elect ſpoken of, they will tell you, that <hi>Elect</hi> doth not ſignifie choſen, but choiſe, or Excellent. Tell them, it is <hi>Electos quos elegit</hi>: the Elect whom he hath choſen: they will ſay, That God chooſeth them then, when they beleeve. Tell them, that God doth chooſe his Elect before the foundation of the world: that is, ſay they,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:96773:38"/>
He did purpoſe to chooſe them when they come to beleeve. But ſo were they juſtified, and glorified before the world was: ſo was the world at an end, before the foundation was laid. Thus no words of holy Writ, how plain ſoever, can ſecure the truth againſt the perverſe wits, of ſuch as are corrupt and ſelf-willed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> he teacheth here, That in the Doctrine of Election we muſt begin with Chriſt: and there are given abroad certain verſes of his, which tender this as a Main-principle to be born in minde, That Chriſt fore-known is the foundation of all, and the not knowing, or learning of this, breedeth many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours: theſe texts ſubjoyned, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. Agreeably whereunto it hath been taught by others of his way, and by ſuch as led the way to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. That Gods firſt Decree, is, <hi>De mittendo Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto,</hi> to ſend his ſon into the world. <hi>Anſw.</hi> There muſt be ſomething of neceſſity, precedent to the Miſſion or Manifeſtation of Chriſt, or to Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to ſend and manifeſt him. I know that in God, who is eternity it ſelf, all things are toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nothing properly going before or following. And to us, as we now are, it is a hard matter to know how to ſpeak or think of Gods manner of acting or proceeding in his Decrees: Nevertheleſs, as when he ſpeaketh unto us in holy Scripture, he is pleaſed to condeſcend to our capacities, and to borrow his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeech from our cuſtome and uſage, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent he may be underſtood of us; So he giveth us
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:96773:39"/>
leave, when we ſpeak of him, to uſe our own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, ſo they be agreeable to his holy Word, and with due regard to him who is in all things infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. Accordingly whereunto we ſay; That as ſome things in the order and manner of the Creatures, are <hi>ſimul tempore,</hi> together as to their beginning in time, which are not, <hi>ſimul naturâ,</hi> together in their own nature, one of them cauſing the other to be; as the Sun, and the light of it; Fire, and the heat of it: In like ſort, Gods election of men, and his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſend Jeſus Chriſt; theſe two, though they be both alike <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> yet <hi>naturâ,</hi> the Election of his Church, goeth before his purpoſe to ſend his Son. And this I prove by thoſe words, <hi>So God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the world, that he gave his Son</hi>: 1. <hi>John</hi> 4. He <hi>loved</hi> us, and <hi>ſent his Son.</hi> Therefore whether it be Gods love and mercy to mankind, in the general; or in ſpecial to the Elect; and whether election be of particular perſons, or beleevers in general; Gods love doth go before his purpoſe or decree to ſend his Son, becauſe he ſent his Son out of his love to Man.</p>
               <p>When a Chriſtian Prince, hearing of ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his ſubjects, held captives under the Great Turk, doth ſend ſuch a ſum of money as is demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; in this caſe certainly his good will that he bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to thoſe his ſubjects, doth precede his ſending, or his purpoſe to ſend the money for their Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
               <p>The Love of God, is, <hi>Cauſa proegumena, quae in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:96773:39"/>
movet ad agendum,</hi> which ſome call <hi>cauſa antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> the cauſe moving from within, The Death of Chriſt is, <hi>Cauſa procatarctica, quae extrinſecus mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet ad agendum,</hi> the cauſe moving from without: and therefore ſubſequent to the other, though both be conſidered together; as he that reſolves upon the end, doth therewithall deliberate and reſolve of the means tending thereto. Gods Love, or good will is an antecedent cauſe to Chriſts manifeſtation. And as a foundation is for the good and benefit of what is laid upon it; ſo was Chriſt given <hi>in caput Electorum,</hi> to be a Head, and a Mediatour, that by him the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect might be brought to Glory. Although there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſon of God, be the Authour and finiſher of our Salvation, if we ſpeak of the Execution of it in time; yet if we ſpeak of the Decree of it, before all time; So Chriſt is not the foundation of our Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but Gods love is. And yet I hope, he will not ſay, we lay any other foundation then Chriſt, according to the Apoſtles ſenſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. any more then the Apoſtle himſelf did, when he ſaid in one place, <hi>The foundation of God ſtandeth ſure,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. and in another, <hi>We are built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Eph.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> he teacheth that Chriſt is not onely <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentum electionis,</hi> but <hi>ſubjectum</hi> alſo and <hi>primus Electorum,</hi> as if God did chooſe Chriſt firſt, and then others; and two places are brought in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, wherein he is ſaid to be <hi>Gods Elect; Iſa.</hi> 42. 1. <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I uphold, my Elect in whom
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96773:40"/>
my ſoul delighteth</hi>: and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. <hi>To whom coming as to a living ſtone, diſallowed of men, but choſen of God, and precious.</hi> Theſe two places are alledged to make good his new Doctrine, that the Great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of Election, which in his Title he promiſed to open, is in the prime notion to be underſtood, of Gods chooſing of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, It is needfull that be done, that he hath omitted; and that is, to diſtinguiſh, and remove the darkneſs, that ariſeth from ambiguity. There is a <hi>fourfold Election.</hi>

               </list>
               <p>Now both the places aboveſaid, where Chriſt is ſaid to be Elected, are meant of an Election to an Office, or Place, Honour and Dignity, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, and plain reaſon evidently ſhew: in <hi>Iſai</hi> 42. he is, <hi>To give judgement, to make Laws, to be a teacher, to be a light of the Gentiles, to open the blinde eyes, and to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96773:40"/>
bring forth the priſoners.</hi> All theſe belong to his Royal and Prophetical Office. And in that place of <hi>Peter,</hi> his office is likewiſe ſpoken of. <hi>To whom co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi>] as to one in chief place, that in him we may be eſtabliſhed: <hi>a chief corner ſtone</hi>] this is for the good of others, to hold the building firm: and ſuch as was the Reprobation, or Rejection; ſuch was the Election ſurely. But the Rejection was in this to be in no place at all: therefore the Election muſt be in this, to be in the chief place of all. So we may ſay that our Saviour was predeſtinated, and preordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>ad officium</hi>; but if we ſay, that he is the firſt of the predeſtinate, or <hi>primus Electorum,</hi> who then is <hi>ſecundus</hi>? None: for none is there of that order to follow. Jeſus Chriſt is choſen to an Office: Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are choſen to ſalvation, Each of theſe is called Election. But the one is not of the ſame kinde, that the other is.</p>
               <p>Therefore, inasmuch as he hath not brought any place where it is ſaid, that Chriſt was elected other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than to an Office: and inasmuch, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> as Election to ſalvation or life eternal importeth either a loſt eſtate, as in men; or a changeable and hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eſtate, as in Angels, who are ſaid to be elected, I <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. and inasmuch <hi>thirdly,</hi> as the Manhood of our Saviour never had any perſonal ſubſiſtence, but was immediately aſſumed to the God-head, paſt all poſſibility of falling into ſin and miſery; in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards, I leave it to be conſidered, whether or no, and how Chriſt may be ſaid to be elected to ſalvation.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:96773:41"/>
But if in no place of Scripture this Election be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, then ſure I am, this is none of the Election that ought to have been ſpoken to, in the Anſwer to the Queſtion above-ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> he teacheth that Chriſt is not onely the firſt Elected, but the onely elected perſonally [<hi>in him all the ſeed ſpringing forth of the travel of his ſoul</hi>] <hi>All,</hi> in the general, not <hi>one</hi> in particular, not <hi>any</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately. But the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>The, foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this ſeal, The Lord knoweth WHO are his. Qui</hi> not <hi>Quales,</hi> who, not how qualified, as, that they are true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, and obedient. This general conſideration may ſoon be known by every one. But you may ſay again, Every one cannot tell <hi>who</hi> they be that are truly faithfull and obedient: but the Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in particular who they be that are ſuch: to this, I return, That unleſs final perſeverance be yeelded, this is no ſure foundation: this is no ſeal, the which uſeth to be for certainty and aſſurance: that founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtandeth not ſure, that is ſubject to change, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt, and apoſtacy. <hi>Qui ſint,</hi> therefore cannot be, beleevers in general: if you ſay, <hi>Qui ſint,</hi> be <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes perſeverantes,</hi> beleevers that hold on in faith and obedience to the end: then I ſay, this is not to the ſcope of the Apoſtle, which is to comfort the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God againſt the fearfull example and offence of Apoſtates. <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> have erred and overthrown the faith of ſome: if ſome fall away, and draw others after them, who can be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure?
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:96773:41"/>
We may all be ſeduced, firſt or laſt: No, ſaith the Apoſtle. <hi>Nevertheleſſ</hi>] that is, though ſome fall away, and others follow, yet Gods elect ſhall ſtedfaſtly abide; But here were no comfort for belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, if onely thoſe who perſevered in true faith and continued to the end, ſhould then, upon their perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance and continuance be ſure not to fall away, as <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> did.</p>

But this is not his ſenſe, although divers have ſo taken Eph. 1.4. He hath helped us elſewhere to know his meaning here. In the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to his other work. § For the matter. <q rend="margQuotes">[We were choſen to bleſſing and holineſs in him, as the preſent Freemen of Lynn, might be ſaid to have been, by foregoing Kings, choſen to ſuch priviledges as they have now, in the firſt chooſing it to be a Corporation, and in thoſe that were then made members of it.]</q> We ſee how ſmall and faint a matter he maketh of Election, if any thing at all: A King of <hi>England,</hi> that above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years now paſt, did chooſe a Corporation (if you call it chooſing) neither did, nor doth, chooſe them who are admitted freemen ſince that time, any more than he did chooſe their chief Magiſtrate, this year; or their Burgeſſes that were ſent thence to the laſt Parliament. There is no Election, where there is no knowledge, of what is choſen, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed. This ſimilitude therefore can neither prove
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96773:43"/>
nor illuſtrate being falſe in the ground of it: yet it helpeth us to his meaning, or interpretation of thoſe words, <hi>Elegit nos in Chriſto</hi>; which is this, God choſe us in chooſing Chriſt: Choſe Chriſt firſt, in him choſe them, who ſhould in after ages beleeve in him. This gloſs did well become the Problems of that hardy adventurer, who attempted to wreſt and winde up our Engliſh Articles to the Church of Rome. But for Mr <hi>Horn,</hi> who promiſed to cleave perfectly to the word, he might very well have looked onward to the next verſe, verſ. 5. where it is, <hi>per Chriſtum,</hi> by him; which might very well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret <hi>in ipſo,</hi> in him: and he might very well have looked on to the ſeventh verſe, where it is <hi>in quo,</hi> in whom we have forgiveneſs. What? had Chriſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs firſt, and then we in him? had he Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption through his bloud, and then we in him? No: but God did forgive us, and redeem us, and bleſs us, and chooſe us through him, or by means of him, or with reſpect to him, as our Mediatour: or he might have interpreted this place by 1 Theſſ. 5.9. God hath appointed us to obtain ſalvation by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; which is as much as this, he hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen us to ſalvation in Chriſt. And as his ſimilitude is not true, ſo neither is it fitted to the Myſtery now ſpoken of. For God Almighty did chiefly, and in the firſt place (ſo far as we may be able to make difference) chooſe his people to ſalvation, and in the next place choſe Jeſus Chriſt, to the office of Mediatour (no other Election of him I know ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:96773:43"/>
of) Jeſus Chriſt was the gift of God; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving choſen his Church, he gave his ſon to be their Head to bring them together, and to hold them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that they might not fall and be loſt, as they were under the firſt Adam.</p>
               <p>But to prove Election to be perſonal, and not of the generalitie of beleevers; and yet withall to be in Chriſt, I alledge that place in Revel. 13.8. where it is deſcribed by <hi>Names written in the book of the Lamb ſlain.

                     <hi>names written in the book of life.</hi>]</q> I anſwer, not beyond <hi>all,</hi> for it is in ſome contradiction to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; it is his common Doctrine, and in particular beneath at the Qu. and Anſw. 202. That we may not gather Gods love or Election, from our duties of obedience, or inherent graces. Are theſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and diſpoſitions names always written in heaven, and put upon beleving perſons when they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt, and are endued with thoſe qualities; and ſhall they not ſignifie that God hath <hi>then</hi> elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and doth <hi>then</hi> love ſuch perſons? Shall they be names in the book of life, and ſhall they not no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the perſons upon whom they are put, as heirs of life? This therefore is in clear contradiction to himſelf. He ſhould not be ſo forward as he is, to accuſe his brethren for making a mingle-mangle, of ſome matters they take in hand; for he hath here moſt confuſedly mingled together Qualities with Names, Names proper with names appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and if his Atchievements take place, and be anſwerable to his eſſays, he will go near to bring us all to Babel, that none ſhall underſtand other. If the Meſſenger that bringeth to a Corporation, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for Election, ſhould deliver it to the chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate there, with theſe words; Sir, I have brought you here a writing for choice of Burgeſſes, together with the names of thoſe whom you are to chooſe, for to ſerve in Parliament; hearing this, he would perhaps think, there were ſent him a <hi>Cónge d'eſlire,</hi> and fear ſome infringement of libertie: but opening
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:96773:44"/>
it and finding nothing but ſome general and uſual qualifications, well conſiſting with freedome of choice; he might very well chide him for ſuch abuſe, and ask him where he learned to talk ſo frivolouſly and ſo fondly. Qualities are not Names; neither are Names Qualities: Qualities are inherent in us; Names are impoſed on us: neither is that a mans Name al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways by which he is called. Noah was righteous and he was called ſo, yet that was not his name. Moſes was meek, and was called ſo; yet that was not his name. In the language of holy Scripture, Names do ſignifie Perſons, and individual Subſtances: <hi>he calleth the ſtars by their names: I know thee by name,</hi> Exod.33. <hi>I have called thee by Name,</hi> Iſai.43. <hi>He cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his own ſheep by name, Joh.</hi>10. Can any take theſe places to be meant otherwiſe, than of individual and perſonal notice? Nothing will ſerve Mr <hi>Horn,</hi> but ſuch names, as <hi>John</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> and ſo long as we cannot finde theſe ſpoken of in Gods word, he will not yeeld, there are any ſuch written in heaven; nor any perſonal Election: but what if he can finde ſuch names as <hi>Clement</hi>? Will that ſatisfie him? when the Apoſtle ſaith Phili. 4.3. with <hi>Clement</hi> alſo, and other my fellow-labourers, whoſe <hi>Names</hi> are written in the book of life; I take his meaning to be this; as if he had ſaid, with <hi>Clement,</hi> and thoſe others, whom though I name not now in this Epiſtle, as I do <hi>Clement</hi>; yet are their names written far more happily elſewhere, even in the book of life with God in heaven.

                     <hi>Q.</hi> 142. Doth not the Scripture tell us that God elected Jacob perſonally to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and rejected Eſau, perſonally from it, before they were born, or had done good or evil?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> God did elect Jacob, but the Apoſtle neither ſays perſonally, nor to or from ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qu.</hi> 143. How are we to underſtand him then?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That he choſe Jacob nationally (that is, him and his poſteritie to be priviledged with the choice means of ſalvation above all nations, and therein gave him the Dominion, and rejected Eſau and his poſteritie from the ſame, yet ſo as his family, and all the families of the earth, had bleſſing in Jacob's, and might have enjoyed it, in ſubmitting to him.</p>
                  <p>This appears to be the Apoſtles meaning: 1. The Oracle to <hi>Rebecca</hi> ſpeaks of them as of two nations. 2. The Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> applies it to their poſterities. 3. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of caſting off the nation of the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:96773:45"/>
Jews. 4. Nor doth he ſpeak of them, as ſo reprobated, that it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them to be ſaved.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let it be ſuppoſed, that the words are not taken perſonally, but are to be taken of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites preeminence above the Edomites in outward and temporal Priviledges: yet this is enough by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, to ſhew that God is free in his choice, and refuſal; in that they who are every way alike, are not alike dealt withall, whether it be in worldly bleſſings, or ſpiritual, or eternal: if temporal inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance be of Gods purpoſe wholly, not of works; then alſo the heavenly: and why may not one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as well as one People, be loved, and another hated, before either good or evil done?</p>
               <p>But <hi>ſecondly,</hi> The Election and the Rejection were Perſonal. The Scripture in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> ſpeaketh primarily of their Perſons: in <hi>Malachi,</hi> ſecondarily, and by application, of their poſterity. Anſw. to Qu. 143. [Him and his Poſterity] The perſons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the Heads of the reſpective nations, are not to be excluded. And in particular, for the perſonal Reprobation of <hi>Eſau,</hi> it that muſt be ſpoken to: 1. Holy Scripture ſaith, he was a <hi>profane perſon,</hi> for that he ſold his Birth-right for a Break-faſt: it is not ſaid, he was unwiſe, to make ſo fooliſh a bargain; but profane, ſo to under-value and part with his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the land of Canaan, the right he had to the promiſe, and to the covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:96773:46"/>
in ſo contemptuous a manner. 2. It is ſaid he was <hi>hated of God.</hi> Now though hatred may ſometime ſignifie leſs love, yet not always, yet not here like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, where there are ſuch Synonymous phraſes, as hardened veſſels to diſhonour, veſſels of wrath. 3. The Apoſtle bringeth <hi>Eſau</hi> for an example, or proof, that ſome of <hi>Abrahams</hi> children may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, may be children of the fleſh, and not children of God, not children of the promiſe, <hi>Room.</hi> 9.8,13. Let us not go about to make void the Apoſtles ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. Nevertheleſs, if any man will contend, that as the bleſſings conferred on <hi>Jacob,</hi> and denied to <hi>Eſau,</hi> were typical; ſo alſo was the Election of the one, and the Rejection of the other: and that <hi>Eſau</hi> was onely <hi>Typus Reproborum,</hi> and that he did repent afterwards, being reconciled to his Brother, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. and return to the Church of God; The Allegorical expoſition of theſe two texts, in <hi>Geneſis</hi> and <hi>Malachi,</hi> are ſufficient to confirm the Apoſtles Doctrine of Election and Reprobation, which he treateth of in thoſe three chapters, <hi>Rom.</hi>9,10,11.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas our Authour would have the Election of <hi>Jacob</hi> to conſiſt in this, that he and his poſterity were priviledged, with the <hi>choice</hi> means of ſalvation. 1. It moveth ſome wonder that ſo great weight ſhould be laid upon the greater or leſs means of ſalvation, by them who hold all men in the world to have ſufficient means of ſalvation.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> were brought up alike in the ſame family, inſtructed in the ſame religion, made
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:96773:46"/>
alike partakers of the ſeal of the righteouſneſs of Faith, thus far they were not differenced.</p>
               <p>3. A Catechiſt who pretends to deliver common grounds of Divinity, ſhould deliver them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon terms of Divinity In his Title, was, the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of <hi>Election</hi>: But to be priviledged with the means of ſalvation, this is, and ought to be called <hi>Externall vocation,</hi> which is expreſly contra-diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from Election, by our bleſſed Saviour, when he ſaith, <hi>Many are called, few are choſen.</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly S. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſhews the difference, betwixt the Church viſible, and inviſible; and that all are not Iſrael, that are of Iſrael, becauſe God chooſeth and refuſeth whom he will, of thoſe who belong to the Church, and partake of the outward Call: but he makes no compariſon or oppoſition betwixt Iſraelites and Ethnicks; nor betwixt Chriſtians, and Infidels; nor betwixt thoſe that have more means, and thoſe that have leſs means: But to remove the offence, which did ariſe from the Jews rejection of Chriſt and his righteouſneſs, he ſheweth that God doth keep his promiſe with <hi>Abraham,</hi> in that he ſaveth his children of the promiſe, whom he chooſeth to Glory, whether they be many or few, whether they be Jews or Gentiles.</p>
               <p>4. It had been agreeable and tending to our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours deſigne, if he could have ſhewed, that in theſe three chapters, 9,10, and 11; there is no other love nor hatred ſpoken of, or intended, but onely as thus far, that God offers to ſome the more choice means
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:96773:47"/>
of Salvation; to others, but ordinary and common means: and that to ſhew mercy, and to harden, is the ſame with affording choice means, and ordinary means. But this he could never do. Did God love his Church of the Old Teſtament, leſs than us of the New Teſtament? Was his love ſo much leſs to the Kings and Prophets, who deſired to ſee Chriſts day, then it was to the Apoſtles, who ſaw what the others deſired to ſee, but could not ſee? Or was <hi>Caperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> more beloved of God, then <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> ſo far as the one ſhould be ſaid to be loved, the other ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? the one elected, the other reprobated? In what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever way it be, that God may be ſaid to harden, he hardeneth them that he ſends the beſt means to, as ſoon as any other: yea, by his word he hardeneth them. To the Prophet he ſaith, by whom he ſends, and when he ſends his word, <hi>Make the heart of this people fat, and their ears heavy</hi>; and the Goſpel preached by the Apoſtles themſelves, was the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to death, as well as to life. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.49. <hi>The wiſdome of God ſaid, I will ſend them Prophets and Apoſtles, and ſome of them they ſhall ſlay and perſecute</hi>; He ſends oftentimes, and in wiſdome ſends, where he knoweth little good will be done. Or he ſhould have ſhewed, that there is no Election or Rejection ſpoken of, in all that diſcourſe of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to or from ſalvation. But this he could never do: for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh of an Election that is made out of thoſe who have choice external means: a chooſing out of theſe. Among the Iſraelites who were for number
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:96773:47"/>
as the ſand, a remnant ſaved, chap.9.27. of whom <hi>Paul</hi> was one, chap. 10.1. there was a people whom God fore-knew, verſ.2. that is, a people not onely called, but choſen. Iſrael hath not obtained, but the Election hath obtained, verſ. 7. Out of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites therefore, who were elected to choice means of ſaluation, there was an Election to life eternal, which properly is called the myſterie of Election. But now it is to no purpoſe all that he hath ſaid, concerning <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> unleſs he intended to prove that the Apoſtle hath not rightly alledged the Testimonies concerning them, out of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and the Prophecy ot <hi>Malachi.</hi>

They need not be aſſiſted, in ſetting up ſuch ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious fancies, and conceits of their teachers, and outward helps to holineſs and happineſs.

And 2. ſome others are too ready to lay the blame here, and give this the reaſon, why they and the world about them amend no faſter, becauſe they are no better taught. World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, when they have no minde to finde the way to true converſion, and reformation; begin often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to quarrel with their Miniſters and Paſtours, as not being qualified with <hi>awakening</hi> gifts: their way of preaching is not <hi>efficacious</hi>: and, who was ever known to be converted by a Liturgy? forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the mean time the 16 chapter of S.

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> A Doctrine it is uncomfortable, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:96773:49"/>
uncharitable, to teach, that thoſe perſons, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples ſake, who living in the darker corners of this Land, have not ſo plentifull inſtructions, as others have, are therefore made of God to be veſſels of diſhonour. God ſeeth not as man ſeeth; chooſeth not according to outward appearance and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; but requireth of Chriſtian people, according to what they have, and not according to what they have not: it lies not all upon the edge of the inſtrument, or weapon; but ſtrength of the hand, in this work: and oftentimes, the firſt are laſt, and the Liſt firſt. Mans life conſiſteth not, whether it be corporal or ſpiritual, in the abundance of the means that he poſſeſſeth, but in Gods bleſſing and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly influence, which cauſeth often, as good health and habitude with. <hi>Daniels</hi> pulſe, as <hi>Benjamins</hi> double Meſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A like Doctrine it is to teach, that whom God forbeareth not, but chaſteneth and ſcourgeth early, they are therefore veſſels of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, but who knoweth not that Judgement uſeth to begin at Gods houſe? and that if there be a difference, he leaſt of all forbeareth thoſe that be his own? the fruit of this Doctrine would be, to add affliction to the afflicted, and help to make up the meaſure of their ſufferings, who finde not the power of God exerciſed for their good, with the mark and deſignation of reprobates.</p>
               <p>In the very next verſe following the mention of veſſels to honour and diſhonour, it is ſaid that, <hi>God</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:96773:50"/>
                  <hi>endureth with much long-ſuffering the veſſels of wrath,</hi> Rom. 9.22. and doth forbearance help to make a veſſel of honour? ſpoken of verſ. 21. Our Authour either could not or would not ſee what was next at hand, and lay plain before his eyes: otherwiſe, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Gods forbearance to puniſh, had never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the deſcription of a veſſel made to honour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> he interprets that to be a veſſel to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, upon which any honour is conferred though for the duration, temporary and tranſitory, for ſuch are all the honours that he mentioneth. Thus Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, even then, when an Unbeleever, Thief, and Devil, was notwithſtanding a veſſel of honour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Dialect of theſe inſtructions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was born withall, and preferred in outward means to life eternal before thouſands of others whereas this prepoſition, <hi>In, I N honorem, I N con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumeliam,</hi> not <hi>of,</hi> but <hi>to</hi> honour, and diſhonour, being a final particle, and denoting the end; cannot otherwiſe well be taken, than to denote a final ſtate, and condition permanent. Had it been his aim to take the Apoſtles ſenſe, and not to force a meaning upon him; in the very next verſe, verſ. 22. he might have ſeen explained what is meant by veſſels of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, namely, veſſels made up and fitted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, not leſs forborn, leſs regarded, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> according to the tenour of the anſwer aboveſaid, the ſame perſon may be a veſſel to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and diſhonour both; ſucceſſively, at ſeveral
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:96773:50"/>
times; that, confeſſedly: but not onely ſo, but <hi>ſenſu compoſito</hi>; at the ſame time, he ſhall be a veſſel of honour, becauſe he is preferred before ſome others, and a veſſel of diſhonour, becauſe ſome others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain are preferred before him, in participation of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine patience and goodneſs, and outward aid. For thus it muſt needs be, in the ſeveral degrees, and the variety of theſe kinds of ſavours vouchſafed of God to the ſons of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> if we view the words before, that gave the occaſion to theſe, we ſhall ſoon perceive how unlikely a matter it is, that either Jew or Gentile, ſhould charge God above with injuſtice, or that the Apoſtle ſhould defend Gods juſtice, by checking the preſumption of humane reaſon; and yet nothing be objected but this, that God uſeth ſome men bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than he uſeth others, in patience towards them, and means tending to life, and power exerciſed for their good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> there would be no colourable cauſe of complaint againſt God, nor ſhould any man need to ſay, why haſt thou made me thus? if it be in his power to make himſelf otherwiſe, to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, even as he will, notwithſtanding any thing that God hath done. He may haply honour one man more than another, in outward mercies, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, which thereafter as a man ſhall well or ill make uſe of, he ſhall make himſelf accordingly a veſſel of wrath, or mercy.</p>

               </q>
               <p>The brief of theſe inſtructions is this; according to the New light that ſome blazing Comets have afforded us: The works of Creation and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, bring men to the knowledge of Chriſt our Saviour, and the Sun, Moon, and Stars preach the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>As for Chriſts interpoſing betwixt God and us, I do in the firſt place acknowledge, that his Mediation is not onely ſufficient, that is to ſay, potentially effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:96773:52"/>
but moreover actually efficacious, for all men in the world, whether they come to know any thing of him or no; yea, for the other creatures alſo: thus far, as to that mixture and meaſure of mercy which they enjoy, and conſervation of them in that eſtate, wherein we now behold them. God did ſo far accept of <hi>Noahs</hi> ſacrifice, <hi>Gen.</hi>8. from which he ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a ſweet ſavour; that he ſaid, <hi>I will not again curſe the ground any more: but while the earth remaineth, Seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time and Harveſt, Cold and Heat, Summer and Winter, Day and Night ſhall not ceaſe.</hi> It is more likely that the weight of ſo great a promiſe, and of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, to the worlds end, ſhould reſt and bear it ſelf, upon the virtual contents of <hi>Noahs</hi> ſacrifice; than upon the Dutie, Obedience, or Religious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of <hi>Noahs</hi> perſon at that time. The ſacrifice of <hi>Noah</hi> might pleaſe God, but that with which he was pacified and appeaſed, was the virtue of Chriſts ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, contained Sacramentally in that of <hi>Noah,</hi> as it was alſo in all the Propitiatory offerings of the Old Teſtament, in which was offered and performed true ſatisfaction and propitiation, though not truly, or in truth, but onely in Type and figure.</p>
               <p>And as this promiſe or purpoſe of God, touching the preſervation and upholding of Man, and all fleſh; although it were abſolute and not conditionate, nor with any contract made, is yet called in Scripture, a Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi>9. taking that term at large and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly: So hath the Rain-bowe been called a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of it, in like large and improper acception.

Thus far we hold that Jeſus Chriſt did interpoſe as a general Mediatour: but this no way conduceth to the purpoſe of theſe Queſtions and Anſwers: and that for theſe two reaſons: 1. Becauſe thus much is not known to all men by means of the works or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God, but to ſome onely, and that by means of his word. 2. Becauſe this Mediation availeth onely, and extendeth onely, to temporal and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly benefits, not to ſalvation, or life eternal. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in this Catechiſme, the works of God are ſaid to ſpeak a further Mediation, and to be means with which Gods ſpirit and power is converſant <q rend="margQuotes">[To bring men to faith in Chriſt, and ſo to the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings in him, even to be veſſels of mercy.</q> Queſt. and Anſw. 146, 147, 148.</p>
               <p>In gainſaying which opinion, I craveleave to ask this queſtion: Do the Sun, Moon, and Stars toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with other works of Gods Creation, ſpeak any other language now, then they did before the fall of man? it muſt be anſwered, No. As the Sun doth ſhine alike, at this day upon the juſt and the unjuſt; ſo did it upon <hi>Adam,</hi> while he was in Paradiſe, and when he was thence excluded. All things continue alike from the beginning of the Creation, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. which though brought in as the ſaying of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtours, yet doth not the Apoſtle deny the truth of what is ſaid, but onely their falſe collection and reaſoning thence: namely, that becauſe the world hath ſo long continued, therefore it muſt always continue, and never have end. Now ſhall we think,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:96773:53"/>
that Jeſus Chriſt did interpoſe as Mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us, when as yet there was no need? Or, that there was a Remedy publiſhed to the world, before the Maladie was known, or was? If any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there be in the Dialect and voice of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and works of God; then, they do not utter his goodneſs towards men <hi>more,</hi> than they did before ſin came into the world, rather his anger and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand: The vanity and ſervitude of corruption, to which the creature is unwillingly ſubject, teſtifying as well the frown of Gods countenance, as the ſin and fall of man. The characters of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, though they be not very dim to be diſcerned, yet are they very difficult to be diſciphered, and do preſent to the quickeſt view and apprehenſion, the Bounty of the Supreme Lord, and the curſe of his Law, ſet one over againſt the other; but not the contents of the Goſpel, or the mercy of a Saviour: The Goſpel being Tidings muſt be brought; and being News, muſt be told, before it can be known; and being tendred by way of Covenant, implyeth a neceſſity that notice be given to the parties concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Faith in Chriſt comes by hearing: how can they beleeve in him, of whom they have not heard? Our Redemption is taught us in the ſchool of Chriſt, not in the Theatre of the world. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>1.21. <hi>After that in the wiſdome of God</hi> (that is, in the Glaſs of the Creatures, where ſhineth Gods wiſdome, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and goodneſs) <hi>the world by wiſdome,</hi> (that is, by their own wiſdome, and ſearch, and interpretations,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:96773:53"/>
and collections) <hi>knew not God</hi> (not God a Saviour) <hi>it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſſ of preaching</hi> (that is, by making known to the world, that the eternal Son of God was crucified for them) <hi>to ſave them that beleeve.</hi> No myſtery is known by nature. The Goſpel is a myſterie or ſecret, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>3.16. a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie which none of the Princes of the world knew.</p>
               <p>And whereas he ſaith, Qu, 152. <q rend="margQuotes">The works of Creation do ſpeak of Chriſt, but more obſcurely]</q> againſt this, I argue thus. If heathen perſons by means of the creatures were brought to know Chriſt a Saviour, though more obſcurely; Then, when Chriſt a Saviour is evidently taught, they would have entertained him: But when he was evidently taught, they refuſed him, and counted his Goſpel fooliſhneſs: Therefore they did not know him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, no, not ſo much as obſcurely.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> preached Jeſus at <hi>Athens,</hi> where was higheſt improvement of natural light, he was not onely encountred by the Philoſophers, even the Stoicks, the beſt of the pack; but a worſe matter then ſo, he was had before the Higheſt Court, and endited for innovating in Religion. And every where, as well as there, was the Goſpel ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.</p>
               <p>He who ſhould have counted all fabulous, that was reported of <hi>America,</hi> or the Weſtern world, at the firſt diſcovery; certainly that man never had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, any ſuch ſuſpicion or ſurmiſe, as <hi>Columbus</hi> had: namely, that of the huge ſpace or quantity of the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:96773:54"/>
Globe terreſtrial, which the Sun in daily motion compaſſeth, and which was not then taken notice of, there might be as well land as ſea, and that land habitable and inhabited: for had he thus imagined of himſelf, he would not then have laughed at the ſtory of the New-found land, and held it as a fooliſh fiction.</p>
               <p>Had the Mediation of Chriſt a Saviour been dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gathered from the fabrick of the world, and works of Providence; then would it not, when fully, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and credibly publiſhed, prove to be matter of offence, and be judged folly, as it was of them who had no other call but outward. And how could that be ſeen of them by the leſs light, that was not ſeen of them by the greater light, ariſing, and ſhining on them?</p>
               <p>And whereas he ſaith, that <q rend="margQuotes">Gods works ſpeak chriſt, as the work the workman]</q> it comes in here impertinenly, and belongs to the former member of the Diviſion; <q rend="margQuotes">They ſpeak of God, but do they ſpeak of Chriſt?</q> So asketh the Queſtion, which is as much as to ſay thus; The works ſpeak of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, but do they ſpeak alſo of a Saviour? Now they ſpeak God the <hi>Creatour,</hi> and not Chriſt the <hi>Saviour,</hi> as the work the workman. Secondly, it is true that the work ſhews the workman: but as a workman, and no further: it ſhews <hi>qualis,</hi> or <hi>qualis artifex,</hi> but not <hi>quis</hi>: not his name: if it did, we ſhould not ſee Artiſts ſet their names upon their curious pieces, Such a one <hi>Fecit, Sculpſit</hi>; or if his

name, not his diſpoſition, and moral character: or if that, not his Will and Teſtament.</p>
               <p>If a Nobleman ſhould build a large and fair houſe, furniſhing it with all things needfull, and making it his place of reſidence, ſhould freely entertain paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, for the time they ſtay with him; thus far may they well reaſon and conclude: Surely this great man had money enough, neither did he ſpare for any coſt in rearing this edifice. One of good judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he is, and diſcretion, thus to contrive the rooms, and order his family in ſo frugal, and ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull a manner: A good and courteous man he alſo is, to treat us ſo liberally, that we want neither meat, nor drink, nor lodging, nor atendance. Thus far ſhould they argue well, from the effect to the cauſe; from the work, to the workman. But too ſimple and ſhallow ſhould he be among them, that ſhould conclude thus from the premiſes: Therefore ſurely, he will pay my debts; therefore he will put me into his Will, and give me ſuch and ſuch Legacies: therefore he will make me one of his heirs. The works which God hath made, and the bleſſings he beſtoweth on us, with an open hand, and daily load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us withall, do witneſs of him, his goodneſs, his eternal power and Godhead. But they ſhew not who he is, they declare not his name, nor that he is the God of Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob, that brought Iſrael out of Egypt: This is his name; and this is his memorial: they ſhew not his nature; nor the perſons of the Trinity; and therefore not the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

               <p>And I do obſerve here, the Catechiſts partiality. He hath included in a different character, four ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſtances of ſuch as have falſe conceptions touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God Almighty. The firſt is, ſome of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, who worſhip God in the picture of an old man. The ſecond, his Adverſaries, whom he ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deal withall, in this Catechiſme, and againſt whom principally it was compoſed, as intentionally for his chief aim, ſo intenſively, for his greateſt earneſtneſs: theſe he meaneth who conceive of God as cruel. The third, they who hold God to be all Mercy, as the old <hi>Marcionites,</hi> and many others now, their near allyes. The fourth the Epicureans, who denie Providence; theſe four. Now of theſe four, he repreſents the firſt, ſo as they themſelves
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:96773:57"/>
do willingly own, what he chargeth them withall. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, that though it be not a matter of Faith, but of Opinion, yet for his part, he holds it lawfull, to picture God, <hi>in forma hominis ſenis</hi>; and the 7th of Daniel is commonly alledged, where it is ſaid, that <hi>the Ancient of days did ſit, and the hair of his head was like the pure wooll,</hi> (that is, white as wooll) <hi>as white as ſnow.</hi> Rev.3. And yet perhaps, and by the way; the ground of the proof from thence, may be found to fail. For, firſt, <hi>Candidum,</hi> and <hi>canum,</hi> are not the ſame: whiteneſs, moſt likely, meaning not hoari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or age, but purity, or ſanctity. <hi>Mundities,</hi> not <hi>canities,</hi> as well in hair, as garment. Secondly, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquus,</hi> and <hi>Senex,</hi> are not the ſame. <hi>Ancient,</hi> doth ſignifie Gods Eternity, before all times; but an old man, is looked upon as decaying, and going out of the world, <hi>Et quod ſeneſcit prope eſt interitum,</hi> Hebr.8. The heavenly Spirits whom God hath placed next himſelf, in condition and ſtate, as well as in ſtation, are pourtrayed with younger faces commonly: Even as that Angel, that rolled away the ſtone from our Saviours ſepulchre, was <hi>in forma</hi>

But whether the practice can be made good or no, it is not denied, nor diſowned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:96773:57"/>No more is that which is charged upon the third ſort, who make God all goodneſs, and mercy; they think they need not be aſhamed of this, ſo pleaſing it is, and plauſible. And our Authour himſelf gives them no great diſcouragement, pag.268. of his work abovenamed, where the queſtion being concerning Gods deſire of mans ſalvation, how great it is, and of his helpfulneſs thereto, he makes a kinde of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at it, that any man ſhould think [<hi>that we can ſpeak too well of God.</hi>] Our ſelves in the mean time being judges, what is well and what is ill, thought or ſaid, and underſtanding goodneſs, not abſolute, but related, which is no other but beneficence, or bounty.</p>
               <p>The fourth ſort are likewiſe forward to maintain the opinion that is laid to them, and think it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to the ſupreme governour of the world, not to look after matters of ſmall regard, one of their founders boaſted <hi>Relligionum animos nodis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvere porgo</hi>: and his followers freely make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Theſe three the Catechiſt deals fairly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and does them no wrong. But when he comes at the ſecond inſtance, or the <hi>partie,</hi> as he calls them in the preface, he moſt invidiouſly lays to them, that which they never ſaid, nor thought: as if they taught God to be cruel, and as if he were by them ſo conceived and apprehended to be.</p>
               <p>Oppoſite to mercy named by him, on one hand, ſtandeth Juſtice, or Severity, as well as Cruelty: but thoſe terms were not for his turn, <hi>Cruelty</hi> is unjuſt
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96773:58"/>
Severity: God puniſheth none but for ſin, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſin is no injuſtice; therefore doth the Apoſtle abominate the thought, of aſcribing to God any injuſtice, even there where mans reaſon muſt leaſt of all be ſatisfied. This is not their opinion, but a falſe and odious deduction of his own. So much for his partiality in this place.</p>

This we think, this we beleeve, and hold. And if any man ſhall ſay, That whiles we are of this minde, and becauſe we think thus much, therefore Satan blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our eyes, hath perſwaded us to it: We will with more modeſty return him this advice, that he would beware of another kinde of blindneſs, which <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Apolog.</hi>9. <hi>Coecitatis ſpecies videri videre quae non ſunt</hi>: it is a kinde of blindneſs to ſee that which is not, or to ſee more than is to be ſeen:

after the ſame manner do we think him to be blind, who can diſcern that Grace is of the ſame extent in the world, that Sin is: and that the Salve provided for mankinde, is full out as broad as the ſore, (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than as before explained upon Qu.93.) and that looks upon the Goſpel, with a falſe pair of ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, by means of which it appeareth far larger, than God hath thought fit it ſhould be.</p>

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:96773:61"/>
that knoweth that Chriſt died for all the world, that whoſoever beleeveth in him ſhould not periſh. Thus the remedie is <hi>for him,</hi> provided that he ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to enjoy it, and attain it. 2.

He that knoweth the remedie to be for him in the firſt ſenſe, may poſſibly not know it to be for him in the ſecond. So plainly they be two ſeveral matters, and yet here they are made all one. The Orthodox do ſay, That a Chriſtian by faith, obedience, and the teſtimonie of the Spirit, may aſſuredly know, that the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Chriſts Death, and the benefits of his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are his own, and efficaciouſly applyed for the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him to ſpiritual life, and hope of inheritance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible. But can any man know the remedie to be for him <hi>thus,</hi> by the word of God alone, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aſide the conſideration of faith and obedience? he cannot. Well may he queſtion the truth of his faith, that hath no better ground to beleeve that Chriſt hath done away his ſins, than this; That he hath done away the ſins of all the perſons in the world.</p>
               <p>How he demeaned himſelf in delivering the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Moral law, we ſaw before: here we have another ſmack of his Antinomian leaven, whiles he denieth works, or graces, or faith either, unleſs it be of his own mark and allowance, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

any thing to the conſolation of a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>He telleth his opinion with ſome paſſion, in the Preface to his other work, <q rend="margQuotes">§. <hi>Onely whereas.</hi> [Their daubings that tell ſouls, they may know that Chriſt loves them, by their good deſires and endeavours, ſtrifes and labours, my ſoul abhorreth.]</q> We have little reaſon to think, that he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth the profeſſion that he made at the beginning; To follow the rule of Gods word, howſoever he might leave the common-road, for moſt certainly he hath here left both the one and the other. Holy Scripture teacheth us to argue from our Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our Juſtification, as being two things never ſevered in the perſon, or their ſubject; though they be diſtinguiſhed in their nature. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature</hi>: and he that is renewed, may be aſſured, that he is in Chriſt, and that Chriſt loves him. They are the Characters which he gave: Bleſſed are the mercifull, the meek, the pure in heart, and they who have good deſires, hungring and thirſting after righteouſneſs: and he hath told us, that they who do the will of God, ſhall enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdome of heaven; and that they are in the mean time to him, as his brother and ſiſter and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I truſt his ſheep will never hearken to the voice of any ſtranger, to the contrary, nor much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard great words. They hear the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, 2 Cor. 1. 12. <hi>Our rejoycing is this, the teſtimony of our conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity we have had our converſation in the world.</hi> And they hear the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:96773:62"/>
Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſay 2 Epiſt. 1. chap. if vertue, and temperance, and patience and godlineſs be in you, you make your calling and election ſure, and you ſhall never fall: and they hear the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſay 1. Epiſt. 3. chap. in this the children of God are manifeſt, even in doing righteouſneſs, verſ. 10. and verſ. 14. <hi>We know we have paſſed from death to life, becauſe we love the brethren.</hi> There is great cauſe that that kinde of faith ſhould be ſuſpected, how much ſoever it be cried up, that muſt aſſure our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt, without good actions, or good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
               <p>And whereas alſo he excludeth Revelation, we oppoſe like wiſe the Apoſtles teſtimony, Rom. 8. 16. <hi>the Spirit beareth witneſs that we are the children of God.</hi> and 1 Cor. 2. 12. <hi>We have received the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which is of God, that we may know the things that are freely given to us of God.</hi> I know no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation the pretended orthodox do pretend to, and he ſets himſelf againſt none elſe, and his words are general [<hi>not any other pretended revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I think that under thoſe words in the Qu.

                  <hi>Anſw,</hi> Thoſe who are
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:96773:63"/>
taught, that good works are the product and fruit of faith, cannot ground their faith upon their works. Neither can good Chriſtians value ſuch talk as this while they remember what S. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Shew me thy faith by thy works, and I will ſhew thee my faith by my works.</hi> He that is ſuſpected to be dead, may by a ſtander by, be certainly known to be alive, if he perceive him to draw his breath; and if another of of the by-ſtanders ſhall argue, that it is a great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ground any mans life upon his breath, and that it can be no true life that is ſo grounded; he would by others, be thought in this, not to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, but ridiculous.</p>
               <p>Mans Converſion is a work of that nature, that it is not always eaſie to be diſcerned; neither ought men to be too ſcrupulous, or curious, in finding the time, means, and manner of it. But where theſe are obſcure, or uncertain, and when doubts and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties ariſe, touching theſe; the help hath always been from conſideration of the change that is wrought in us. If a man may aſſuredly know that he hath attained his journeys end, and arrived at the deſired haven; he ought not too much to trouble himſelf, about the way, how he came there. Let not therefore Chriſtians be beguiled of this ſupply and relief, but paſs by, if need be, the circumſtances, of time, and place, and way, and inſiſt upon the ſubſtance, which is the alteration that is made, which they may do, as well, and upon as certain ground, as to this work upon the ſoul, as the blinde
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:96773:63"/>
man did concerning the work that our Saviour wrought upon his body, ſaying, Joh. 9. <hi>One thing I know, that whereas I was blinde, now I ſee.</hi> So may a true convert ſay, I was ſometimes darkneſs, but now am I light in the Lord, Eph. 5. 8. And the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal ſon, had as much cauſe of comfort and joy, as the father had, upon the new return, and change appearing, that He who was dead is alive, and he that was loſt, is found.</p>
               <p>And whereas he told his Auditory then, pag. 19. that it is Phariſaical to conceit, that God loveth us, becauſe of reformations, and frames begotten in us by his grace and <q rend="margQuotes">[a certain ſecret inſenſible work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of power in the heart]</q> it may be anſwered, If the work of the Spirit be ſecret and inſenſible, what better way can there be, to take notice of it, than by the change and alteration that is made in us? He that would know whether the Sun moveth or not, muſt not look upon the Sun, nor can he ſee the ſhadow move upon the Dial; but if he comes an hour or two hence, he may eaſily diſcern, that the Sun and the ſhadow are removed, and that therefore they did move before. But the truth is, our Authour holds no ſuch internal work, or power needfull to converſion, for of the ſix helps to Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſme, afforded by ſuch as are counted orthodox, this is by him counted the ſecond <q rend="margQuotes">[Their ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of faith as wrought by ſome immediate power, as beſides the word preached.]</q> but ſo much for this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:96773:64"/>I think, by [the like] in the Queſtion laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed, he may mean alſo, Conſolations, and ſenſe of heavenly joy: for in a diſcourſe of his, called <hi>A Caveat to true Chriſtians,</hi> pag. 84, 85. he much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, that men ſhould gather comfort or aſſurance, from ſenſible feeling and viſits, and ſaith <q rend="margQuotes">that ſuch are thence called ſenſual, as not living by Faith, but upon matters of ſenſe:</q> thus he there. But where are they called ſenſual? who ever called them ſo? A little before, pag. 82. upon thoſe words of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, They that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, wreſt the Scriptures</hi>; he noteth thus. [He means not unlearned in Aits and languages] But I ſuppoſe, there be few among us, though ſo far il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate, as they be not able to read his book, but even by cuſtome of our Engliſh language, have learned the difference betwixt <hi>Senſual,</hi> and <hi>Senſible.</hi> The word [ſenſual] is twice found. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. and <hi>Jude</hi> verſ. 19. in both places it ſtands oppoſed to ſpiritual, and ſignifies as much as <hi>Carnal</hi>: ſuch as intend onely, and are led by, their part ſenſitive, or carnal appetite, or nature, common to us, with the bruits: (<hi>ſenſual, having not the Spirit</hi>) and in our common ſpeech, a ſenſual man, is one that is given to brutiſh pleaſures. Now ſhall ſuch a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, as is viſited with the conſolations of God, and is made ſenſible of heavenly light and joy; that can in ſome ſort take up the Prophets words, <hi>in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the ſorrows that I had in my heart, thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts have refreſhed my ſoul</hi>; be called Senſual? It
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:96773:64"/>
is true that the ſenſe of divine comfort, and the light of Gods countenance, may denominate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſenſible, namely, thereof: yet not abſolutely ſenſible, for ſuch we call them that are apt to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and underſtand readily what is done or ſaid. But to ſay they are, abſolutely <hi>Senſual,</hi> is ſo groſs a miſtake, that I cannot but wonder it ſhould fall from him who is skilfull in Arts and languages, how ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever undervaluing them in others. <q rend="margQuotes">Not living by Faith, ſaith he, but upon matters of ſenſe.]</q> Faith, and Senſe, may be oppoſed, and are ſometimes, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſtant and contrary; but not as ſenſe is taken here. For they who have, as holy Scripture ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, joy in beleeving; or that, as the Apoſtle <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſaith, beleeving, rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and glorious; do live by faith, and upon ſenſe too, that is upon ſenſible conſolations, or perception of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine favour: as a man may comfort and chear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in a winters night, by the heat of the fire, and the light of it too.</p>
               <p>But what is the reaſon, why we may not beleeve that Chriſt hath dealt graciouſly with us, in that he hath beſtowed upon us, the gifts of Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; or that we may not conclude ſpiritual life, from ſpiritual affections and deſires? It is this, <hi>becauſe a mans heart is deceitfull.</hi> The Scripture ſaith indeed, Mans heart is deceitfull; but it ſaith not, that every mans heart, is at all times and in every thing actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deceived. Some men have a cuſtome <hi>lacerare Scriptur as</hi>; to rend the Scripture, as it were, to tear
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:96773:65"/>
a text out of the Bible, which they think is for their turn, though againſt reaſon, againſt the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie of Faith, and quite contrary to other places, which ſhould, by collation, help to interpret. One Scripture ſaith, Mans heart is deceitfull above all things. Another ſaith, that our heart doth gives right and true verdict concerning our eſtates: If our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things. If our heart condemn us not, it is ſo good a ſigne that we may have confidence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. A faithfull Chriſtian may rightly judge of his own condition, though an hypocrite be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in judging of <hi>his</hi>; whoſe heart yet, as it is heavy in the midſt of his mirth and laughter; may, likely enough condemn him, in the midſt of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and ſelf-deceit. I anſwer ſecondly, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that this rule, here given, or this ſaying of Scripture, without right interpretation, or due reſtriction, That Mans heart is deceitfull, and no ſure foundation of beleeving a thing, being applyed to other matters in like ſort (and why not to others as well as to this?) is a ſure foundation or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Scepticiſme, or beleeving nothing at all; which is not many removes diſtant from Atheiſme. With the heart man beleeves: and if the heart be deceitfull in every thing, how can he beleeve any thing? And thirdly he doth not well, to make oppoſition betwixt a beleeving mans heart, and Gods word. He who collecteth that God loveth him, becauſe he hath beſtowed his ſanctifying
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:96773:65"/>
graces upon him; doth not make his own heart, but Gods word, to be the foundation of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. Nor doth he, as the Text pointeth, Prov. 28. Truſt in his own heart, but maketh uſe of his own heart, or reaſon, in applying the word of God to his own caſe, and his own benefit, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of God. Now followeth the ſecond reaſon.</p>

               </q>
               <p>This is his ſecond reaſon, preferring the faith of the Univerſaliſt, before the faith of the pretended Orthodox: The one is no character of Gods Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the other is. The meaning is this, as if he had ſaid; He who beleeveth that God loveth all alike, and Chriſt died alike for all men, as to the intention of benefit by his Death; hath a right faith, even before any grace of Sanctification wrought. But he who beleeveth that the benefit of Chriſts Death,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:96773:66"/>
who died for all, is more intended to ſome than others, hath no true faith, nor ſigne of Gods Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, though his faith be accompanyed with obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, good deſires and changes, and a pretended teſtimony of the Spirit. An Aſſertion, I know not whether he more boldly, or more blindly uttered. I ſhall touch now onely upon theſe two particulars. 1. How uncharitable he is to his adverſaries, or the diſſenting partie. 2. How uncomfortable, to his own partie. 1. He hath no charity for that party, that is not of his own way. I take charity now for that effect or fruit of charity, which is ſhewed in belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all things, and hoping all things: that is, the beſt things that may be beleeved, and that may be hoped, touching others. He aſſirmeth the faith of the Univerſaliſt, to be the onely diſtinguiſhing character of Gods Election; the faith of all others, be they never ſo vertuous, pious, ſanctified, morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, to be a falſe and feigned faith: it ſeems they ſet their ſoot in the wrong way, at firſt: they began amiſs; and now how far ſoever they go, and how faſt ſoever they go, they ſtill wander and go aſtray in a by-path. What good can be expected from an ill beginning? what firm building, from a ſandy foundation? if the root be rottenneſs, the fruit can be nothing but duſt and ſmoke. But I anſwer: That every one may be ſaved in his own Religion, is an Opinion Anathematized in our Church-Articles. Nevertheleſs Chriſtians are not wont, I am ſure they ought not to be peremptory, in condemning
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:96773:66"/>
one another, upon matters of no greater importance. But of all men, an Univerſaliſt, how ill doth it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to be a Monopoliſt! How ill accordeth that charity to it ſelf (if at leaſt that be not a falſe charity, that overthroweth the true faith) which is in ſo high a flow to Heathens, and in ſo low an ebb to fellow-Chriſtians! But it muſt not be any great matter with us to be judged by man. That perſon, who with a true belief can ſay; The Son of God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me and gave himſelf for me: and with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and thankfull minde can ſay, God hath put his fear in my heart; if not reſearching but adoring Gods ſecret judgements; he ſhall forbear to think, that there was as much good intended to every one as to him; hath far more reaſon to ſuſpect this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſt for a ſeducer, than himſelf for an hypocrite, or unſound beleever. For, ſuppoſing it were true, as we are verily perſwaded it is not, that God had ſuch a love, and ſuch a gracious intention towards all perſons in the world, as this Authour teacheth; yet is not the belief of it, ſo neceſſary an ingredient to juſtifying faith, that it ſhould be no true juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith without it. For as the faith of <hi>Peter,</hi> and many others of the Jews, was a true and ſaving faith, even then when they were ignorant of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Gods Love and Grace in the Goſpel, towards the Gentiles, Act. 10. and 11. So we doubt not but the faith of a Chriſtian beleever, may be, and is, a ſound faith, and character of Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection; although he be to ſeek in this New diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:96773:67"/>
very of Gods good will, and grace extended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men in an equal diſpenſation.</p>
               <p>2. As he is uncharitable to all others, ſo is he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable to ſuch who do think it beſt, to leave the beaten path of Gods Church, and follow him For he doth deprive and ſpoil them of that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and teſtimony of Gods love, which they had from ſanctifying gifts, and inherent graces: having been heretofore rightly taught, that though they might not put confidence in their works, and good deſires; yet they might raiſe and gather confidence and comfort from their works, and good deſires, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying, that their faith is true. And that Apoſtle who ſaid, That his rejoycing was the teſtimony of a good conſcience, and good converſation; adviſeth every man to rejoyce in himſelf, Gal. 6. 4. And whoſoever goeth any other way to work, to get a comfortable aſſurance, than by theſe marks of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and fruits of faith; will never be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh, betwixt a falſe peace of conſcience, and a true; but will be unavoidably expoſed to the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Satan.</p>
               <p>But it may be thought, that he takes his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from their former ſtay, and prop, to help them to a better. What is that? It is to be of his judgement of Univerſal Redemption, and Univerſal Grace Well: ſuppoſe that a ſinner were fully perſwaded that God did wiſh him as well, from the foundation of the world, and as really intend the benefit of Chriſts Death for him, as for any other Saint, now
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:96773:67"/>
glorified in heaven; There cannot hence ariſe any ſtrong conſolation, whiles withall he is perſwaded that God intended as much good from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi>; and whiles withall he taketh notice of our Authours Queſt. and Anſw. 95. <hi>Shall all men then be ſaved eternally? No, the greateſt part go to deſtruction.</hi>] So ſmall relief can be had for a diſtreſſed conſcience, from the common love, or the generality of Gods good will towards all men.</p>
               <p>His texts in the Margin, Tit. 3. 5. <hi>Not by works of rightcouſneſſ, but according to his mercy he ſaved us</hi>: and Rom. 3. and 4. treating of Juſtification, cannot be applyed againſt the knowledge of Gods love that may be obtained by means of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>His laſt reaſon, why we may not gather out of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent graces, that there is mercy and remedy for us, is in theſe words:</p>

Another man whoſe ſins are comparatively ſmall, if he ſtands upon his own righteouſneſs, and good deeds, ſhall be loſt.

It is rightly obſerved, <hi>Finis dat eſſe in moralibus</hi>: it is our intention that doth formalize our words, or our actions; towards God, or man.

               <p>I obſerve of our Authour, that though he think good to conform in his opinions to the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants, and militate under their Banner, for the moſt part either following them in their way, or elſe therein going beyond them; yet he often march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth over into the Tents of the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> and cloſeth with them as their own: which two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nevertheleſs, and their Principles, are wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent, and oppoſite in extremes.

or <hi>captious queſtion,</hi> why of two men, every way alike diſpoſed, going to the ſame ſermon, one ſhould be converted, the other not; he rendreth this reaſon among many others: Becauſe one may be more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious outwardly, and having leſs conceit of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, may ſooner receive inſtruction, than another that is <hi>civilly and religiouſly inclined,</hi> as the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and harlots entred into the kingdome ſooner than the proud conceited Phariſees.] But firſt, Theſe two ſorts of men, are not every way alike diſpoſed: and ſecondly, If he had ſaid, That the civilly and religiouſly inclined, are more ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive inſtruction, than the vitious, he had ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what probable: But the quite contrary by him there delivered, is an errour; and whether it be a vulgar one or no, it is a very weak one, and very ſcandalous to weak people.

               <p>If he be pleaſed to enquire, it may be, he may finde, that they were of his own party, who thought that ſaying of our Saviour, that Salvation was not onely difficult, but impoſſible with men, howbeit poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible with God; to be too harſh and rigid; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſought to make it more ſoft and pliable, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up an odd conceit, that turned the <hi>Camel</hi> into a <hi>Cable-rope,</hi> which might by their own hands be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twiſted, and paſs the needles eye. Little reaſon was for this, but that they had a minde to keep the ſtaff in their own hands, and truſt themſelues rather than any other. Yet I ſay not, that they are as the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees were, truſters in themſelves, that they <hi>are</hi> righteous: but truſters in themſelves, that they <hi>can</hi> be ſo when they will. Thus wicked men are taught by them, to beleeve that God would never be ſo

unreaſonable, as to command any thing that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; or bid them work if their hands were bound; or invite them to come to him, if their feet were not at liberty; and ſo long as God calls them, they have power to come. Such who are loth for the preſent to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, are encouraged to defer their repentance, thinking that they can leave their ſins, and be converted, and become new men at their own leaſure, before their death, at furtheſt when they come to leave this life, that ſo they may be elected (for that is the onely time of peremptory election) to life eternal.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:96773:71"/>
would they but be perſwaded, the work were done. But I take his word, and argue thence; If wicked men be unperſwaſible, as I think they are; then perſwaſion will not do it; that will not do it alone. There muſt be that, and ſomewhat more done. There is no charming of deaf ears: the contumacious will not liſten to fair words. No ſuch hooks will draw Leviathan to the ſhore; no ſuch darts enter his ſcales, while he ſporteth in the deep.</p>
               <p>But if not by perſwaſion, how then? what? by compulſion? Neither. Never yet was any man compelled to either good, or evil. We muſt, and will think that to be the beſt and nobleſt way that God Almighty is pleaſed to uſe: and that is, to give a new ſpirit, and frame of heart; to incline and bend the will to good: yet not to break it, or deprive it of the native liberty, but to cure the depraved nature of it; to amend and rectifie the chief ſpring or wheel of motion. And this is not to offer violence, or force, any more than was offered to that band of men that followed <hi>Saul,</hi> whoſe hearts God had touched; or to <hi>Saul</hi> himſelf, that was turned to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>To draw a man to that which is againſt his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, this indeed is rather violent, then kindly work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. When a Phyſician hath cured the dropſie once, it is then an eaſie matter to perſwade the patient to forbear immoderate drinking; but before that be done, it is either labour loſt, or force offered. The ſtrength of Gods grace overcometh the reluctancie
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:96773:71"/>
and rebellion of mans heart, yet not in a hoſtile way: for as it overcometh the heart ſtrongly; ſo it incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it mildly, and changeth it gently, and healeth it, and raiſeth it to a right temper, and better ſtate; ſo here is more than perſwaſion and yet no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the liberty of will.</p>
               <p>And as for <hi>Illumination,</hi> he hath likewiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a text; <hi>Open Door,</hi> p. 141. whereupon thoſe words, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 7. [<hi>If we walk in the light</hi>] he giveth his paraphraſe: <q rend="margQuotes">Whoſoever receiveth the light that comes from God, and walks therein, as God is in it, affording power, and ſtrength to him there-through]</q> as if all men within the Church were within the light there ſpoken of, and they walked in it that receive it, being preſented to them, and met withall, as our Authour loves to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>But by <hi>Light,</hi> the Apoſtle meaneth <hi>Goodneſſ,</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Purity,</hi> as by <hi>Darkneſſ, Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>Sin:</hi> verſe next before, if we walk in darkneſs: and chap. 2. verſ. 9. <hi>he that hateth his brother is in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>; ſpeaking of Chriſtians, not Infidels. To walk in the light therefore, is not to entertain the means, that God affordeth to his Church, univerſally, as the light of the Sun is ſpread in the air: but it is to live in Gods faith and fear, in holineſs, truth and juſtice. I grant that God is a <hi>Sun,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt calleth him, and as S. James meaneth, when he termeth him the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>Lights:</hi> yea, a ſpiritual Sun: yet doth he not ſhed forth his ſpiritual beams
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:96773:72"/>
any otherwiſe than by a voluntary diſpenſation, when, and how, and to whom he will; not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all alike, not by every one to be met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, or to be walked in: ſo that hence cannot be made good that Univerſal Objective Grace, by ſome maintained.</p>
               <p>Now that ſaving Faith is not produced, in the heart of a ſinner, by Illumination and Perſwaſion onely; may be proved by theſe two arguments. <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe they are far unable to do it; for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is ſo deeply faſtened in mans nature, and ſuch is his Death in ſin, that though his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding be enlightened, and his affections perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yet if his heart and will be not renewed, and changed and quickened, the work will ſtill be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</p>
               <p>To perſwade, is but to preſent objects outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and theſe are looked upon, according as the Subject is diſpoſed; theſe are apprehended, <hi>ad mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum recipientis,</hi> as the party ſtands affected. Never was there foul love, nor fair priſon. Sin, and ſinfull luſts are more beautifull in the eyes of a wicked worldling, and are more ſuitable to him, than the Grace and Glory of heaven, though ſet forth by a potent Oratour. And the wilde Aſs, that hath long been wonted to the range of the hills, ſcorneth the populous and pompous city.</p>
               <p>Illumination likewiſe, is but an outward work; though it be wrought within man, yet it is external to the heart of man; it is from without, and as I may ſay,

forinſecal, and therefore cannot much confer to the power of the ſoul. It is not Light, but Eye-ſalve, that muſt help the facultie, and recover the ſight. And this is to be noted further, that where the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt doth enlighten the minde, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all correct the innate pravitie of the heart; may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and ſometime doth follow, the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt: which ſin, is ſo called, as we know, not becauſe it is againſt the perſon, but againſt the office, or work of the holy Ghoſt, which is, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and to illuminate. And the Devils are thought to be guilty of this kinde of ſin, becauſe of the height of light in them joyned with the height of malice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> ſuppoſe that theſe two, could produce true faith, yet this were not enough to make good, what we are often taught, namely, that Faith is not of our ſelves, but it is the gift of God; yea ſuch a gift as is wrought by the exceeding greatneſs of his power, even that power that raiſed Chriſt from the dead: for what is done ſhould be chiefly by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of the object, thorowly laid open. And as Satan on the one hand enticeth to the pleaſures of ſin, ſo ſhould the Spirit of God on the other, prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer holineſs, and heaven; and promiſe, and excite, and invite, and commend: but the will when it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to, muſt caſt the ſcale, and like an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial judge, no way bent, or made beforehand, give ſentence and determine, what is to be done, and what muſt be followed: and thus ſhall faith be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:96773:73"/>
by man himſelf, and not be as it is called, <hi>Gods gift.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas he ſaith, that God doth work Faith [by the cooperation of the holy Ghoſt] it is to be noted that the Spirit of God in working Faith (if it be meant of the firſt production of it) is not ſaid in ſound Divinity to cooperate with man, as if man did co-work with God. For what is done, is the ſole work of Gods grace and power. As <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> being dead, could do nothing, could not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate to raiſe himſelf to life: but being by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power quickened, he could then eat, and walk and ſpeak. So man being dead in ſin, hath no free will to Good, to Faith or Converſion: but having received Grace, as a principle of ſpiritual life, he can then walk in the Spirit, and Serve God in a ſpiritual manner.</p>

place or Head of Free-will. Yet whereas he ſaith here: No man can hear outwardly of himſelf, but it is Gods gift: it may admit a twofold ſenſe: The firſt is this: No man can come to hear the Goſpel outwardly, unleſs God of his Grace be pleaſed to ſend it to him. And this ſhould be his meaning by one of his texts which he quoteth, Rom. 10. <hi>Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God.</hi> Which words ſignifie thus much, if at leaſt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle may explain himſelf. <hi>Men cannot beleeve in him, of whom they never heard</hi>: neither can they hear but by the word of God: that is, by mandate, or commiſſion from God, to ſome or other, for to go and preach to them. But this is not his meaning: for he is giving the reaſon, why Faith is not wrought in all thoſe, that have the Goſpel; which is this: becauſe they do not hear and learn, but ſtop their ears and refuſe Gods gift.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſenſe therefore is this: That any man is able outwardly to hear the Goſpel, is the gift of God by nature, in whom we live and move, and are. This, I think, he means. But Firſt, this is not proved by his text out of the Proverbs, <hi>The hearing ear and the ſeeing eye, the Lord hath made even both of them.</hi> For as God did frame the earth, and yet the earth doth bring forth fruit of her ſelf, the blade, the ear, and the corn; Mark 4.28. So may man hear the word of God, and ſee the Moon and Stars, of himſelf, though God did frame both the hearing ear, and the ſeeing eye.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:96773:74"/>And ſecondly, the pretended Orthodox, who are thought by ſome, too much to denie free-will, did never yet denie that man hath free-will to natural, and moral actions, and religious too, though not in a ſpiritual manner untill he be regenerate. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſay, as here he doth, that man hath not abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of himſelf to hear outwardly, is a note beneath Gammoth, and a great deal more than needs, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the matter is, that he ſtoops ſo low. But ſeeing he goeth ſo far in denying free-will, I hope he will never be ſo fierce, as ſome have been before him; who, for the Semi-Pelagian objected to them, have returned roundly the Seſqui-Maniche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; with ſomewhat more rage, than reaſon: The Manicheans did indeed deny free-will: but how, <hi>quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad naturam, ſive radicem liberi arbitrii,</hi> according to the very nature of it, or free choice, which is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to man. 2. to evil. 3. before the fall: this was the Manichean. Whereas the Pelagian affirmed, <hi>vires liberi arbitrii,</hi> the power or ſtrength of mans will to good after the fall. And who they be that claim kindred more or leſs, to each of theſe is an eaſie matter to judge and determine. But thirdly, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much courteſie and condeſcenſion, do always give ſome cauſe of ſuſpicion: yet I proceed no further, than to ſuſpicion, or conjecture. He who can, upon quitting the point of free-will, gain in exchange the point of Univerſal Grace, may think himſelf no looſer, having found out a way to corroborate the title of Univerſaliſt, which is thought now, well
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:96773:74"/>
worth the owning and affecting. We know who it was of old time, who talked much of Grace, but when it came to be explained it was nothing but Nature. To hear outwardly, is by nature: to hear inwardly is by grace, both of theſe, are in this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, called, both alike, without any difference, Gods gift: And as far as we may gueſs by his words, here, and in other places, both of them are of like extent, thus far, that look where God giveth the outward hearing, he giveth the inward hearing alſo. Now though it ſhould be granted, that Grace may poſſibly be Univerſal, and beſtowed upon all men, and yet be grace ſtill, and that it doth not conſiſt in being a Priviledge vouchſafed to ſome onely; yet how <hi>univerſal</hi> ſoever it be, it cannot be univerſal <hi>Grace,</hi> unleſs it be ſuperadded to Nature, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral endowments. Gods Grace is always beſide, or, over and above humane nature.</p>
               <p>Barely to hear, is not Grace but nature, ſo is it to live and move, with inward attention to hear, is not univerſal, but belongeth to internal vocation, which is the ſpecial Grace of God, opening the ears and inclining the heart to hear and obey. So that from the power of hearing, can no way be made good, Univerſal Grace.</p>

               <p>Such a faith as is feigned and unſound, may be loſt: but true faith, that is of a right kinde, is not loſt. Our bleſſed Saviour hath learned us this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and taught us this Doctrine, Matth. 13, verſ. 21, 23. True faith hath rooting, and is fruitfull, and abideth.

               <p>This therefore, may well be added, and inſerted into his Anſwer. Such faith from which any man doth fall, was never true faith, even while he did ſtand therein.

And as it was more ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Gods nature, who is a Spirit, to be worſhipped in ſpirit and truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. and not as before Chriſts coming, in outward rites, ſhadows, and ceremonies, which then bare a great part of Gods ſervice; So was it more agreeable and conſonant: That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there is one God, Creatour of all mankinde, there ſhould be now acceſs to him for all people, by one Mediatour, and not for one nation onely as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And becauſe this cannot be done ſo well, not quietly and peaceably, unleſs Kings and earthly Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates embrace the Chriſtian faith; Therefore
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:96773:77"/>
eſpecially muſt they be prayed for.</p>
               <p>So that Gods <hi>will,</hi> in this place, is not his <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>; and <hi>to be ſaved,</hi> is matter of reward, not of work; a reward which he beſtoweth on us, not a work which he commandeth us to do. And to come to the knowledge of the truth, is not to beleeve, but to be made partakers of the Goſpel, by publication: The which was joyned indeed with a command or charge to his Apoſtles, to preach the Goſpel; but no command there was to the Nations to receive it, untill it were brought them, and they did come to the knowledge of it.</p>
               <p>But may the univerſaliſts now ſay: If it be indeed the will of God, that <hi>all</hi> that hear the Goſpel ſhould be ſaved: Then is not ſalvation limited to ſome onely, called the <hi>Elect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, by putting them in minde, of what I ſuppoſe they have often heard. <hi>Gods will</hi> is twofold: 1. <hi>Revealed, and Conditional</hi>; thus he willeth all men to be ſaved. 2. <hi>Secret and abſolute</hi>; ſo he willeth onely a few to be ſaved. If they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand how he ſhould will things thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one to the other, let them help themſelves with this ſimilitude. A Nobleman, Landlord to many decayed tenants deeply endebted to him, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them to pay what they ow him, otherwiſe to be ejected. To ſome few of them, formerly his menial ſervants, he ſendeth ſecretly ſupplies, and enableth them to diſcharge their arrears: againſt the reſt the law paſſeth. The Landlords will now is, that all his
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:96773:78"/>
tenants ſhould pay their rents, enjoy their houſes and lands as formerly, and that none of them ſhould be diſpoſſeſſed, or empriſoned. And it is his will alſo, that a few of his tenants ſhould certainly hold poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, though moſt of them be caſt out: of theſe two, the firſt will is conditional, upon their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, and payment: the ſecond is abſolute, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe accompanied with his power and purſe, and grounded upon his own performance. If this be right, and reaſon, and plain to be underſtood; then let them not ſay, that we denie the Scripture-ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>God willeth all men to be ſaved</hi>: and let them give us leave to ſay withall, that he doth not <hi>abſolutely</hi> will all men to be ſaved, becauſe he doth not by his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty arm, reſcue all men out of the bands of infidelity, in which by their own fault they are faſt held.</p>

What I have written is upon the former: whereas it might have ſeemed more ingenuous to have dealt with the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, containing ſecond thoughts, &amp; ſome alteration. This is the objection. My Anſwer now followeth. It was the firſt Edition onely that was brought and put upon me, having not ſo much as heard of any ſecond, untill I had welnigh gone thorow with the obſervations here tendred. Secondly, the firſt was publiſhed, and is extant, and in the hands of many, who will not be very ready, ſo long as they have one, to enquire after another of the ſecond im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. Thirdly, how far this allegation may be plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, who told us that which hath been noted once before, <q rend="margQuotes">There was nothing in the firſt Edition, but what might look his worſt adverſaries in the face,</q> I leave to himſelf to be conſidered. And laſtly, How little the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is, &amp; how the difference is not very material, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as to the chief points of Heterodoxy, and how the Retractation none at all, I leave to others to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For as when we have once acknowledged the Truth, and never ſo much as once denied it, there lieth no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon us, that we ſhould at all times make confeſſion of it: So an Errour or Errours once divulged and ſpread abroad, are not ſufficiently recalled by ſilence and omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but remain the Authours own, till ſomething more be done, and it is well if then the danger ceaſeth.</p>
