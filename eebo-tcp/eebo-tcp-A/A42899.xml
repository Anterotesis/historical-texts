            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>WO Years were now elaps'd from the time of their firſt Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Diſciples</hi> had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>Auditors</hi> in the <hi>School</hi> of the <hi>Word made Fleſh,</hi> converſing daily with him,

hearing the Sacred <hi>Oracles,</hi> which diſtill'd from his <hi>Gracious Lips,</hi> and beholding the great <hi>Miracles</hi> he wrought for the Benefit of Mankind. And now it was high time they ſhould give ſome Account of what they had learn'd under ſo Divine a Maſter. In order to this, our Lord deſigns a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn <hi>Examination;</hi> and having led them into the Coaſts of <hi>Caeſarea Philippi,</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes two Queſtions to them. The <hi>Firſt,</hi> Preliminary only, to open the way, and lead them (as it were by the Hand) into the Knowledge and Confeſſion of the Truth, <hi>Quem dicunt homines eſſe Filium ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis?

            </p>
            <p>To the <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe Queſtions the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was eaſie, becauſe the Judgments of the World are every where to be met with; and ſo, without any demurring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter, they readily anſwer'd, <hi>Some ſaid, that He was John the Baptiſt; ſome, that He was Elias; others, Jeremias, or ſome one of the Prophets.</hi> Theſe were the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

the World made of him: But why not one Word of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> among the reſt, ſince they knew the term of Years was now expir'd, and his Coming daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted? No ſooner did the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> appear <note place="margin">Jo. 1. 19.</note> out of his Solitude, but preſently a ſolemn Embaſſy of Prieſts &amp; Levites was ſent from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to ask him if he were not <hi>the Chriſt</hi> who was to come. But when the <hi>Meſſias</hi> himſelf appears, the beſt Title they can afford him, is of a <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> or an <hi>Elias,</hi> or a <hi>Jeremias,</hi> or ſome one of the Prophets; but no mention at all of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> O falſe and deceitful World, how Erroneous art thou in thy Weights, and Unequal in thy Meaſures, giving to one what is due to another, and always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viating from Truth, either by Exceſs or Defect!</p>
            <p>That theſe Judgments the World made of his Perſon, were ſuch, that is, Erroneous, our Lord ſufficiently intimated by leaving them, and addreſſing himſelf to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples with the <hi>Second</hi> Queſtion; <hi>Vos autem quem me eſſe dicitis?</hi> But you, My Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, who now for two Years together have been daily Witneſſes of my Life and

Converſation, and ſeen the great Works I have done, <hi>Whom do you ſay that I am?</hi> Here the reſt of the Apoſtles, not knowing what to anſwer, (for this Doctrine, as St. <hi>Cyril</hi> ſays, was above their reach) <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd</hi>

            <p>And now what was the Reward (as St. <hi>Hilary</hi> calls it) of this ſo Noble and <note place="margin">S. Hilar. in Matth. c. 16.</note> Generous a Confeſſion? Firſt, He declar'd him <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> in having been ſo highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd by God: And then, as it follows in the Words of my Text, and the Sequel of the Goſpel, He ſaid unto him, <hi>Et ego dico tibi, quia Tu es Petrus: And I ſay alſo to thee, that Thou art Peter,</hi> (which is by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation <hi>a Rock) and upon this Rock I will build my Church, and the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.

            <p>Had theſe been the Words of a <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom,</hi> or ſome other fam'd Orator, in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyrick of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> they might have been look'd upon as <hi>Hyperboles,</hi> or Exaggerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Rhetorick. For if they be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to mean as they ſound, never was <hi>ſuch Honour</hi> and Dignity as this, conferr'd upon any of the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> from the Creation of the World. But now that the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> who is Truth it ſelf, has been pleas'd to be the Encomiaſt of our <hi>Saint,</hi> and to pronounce them with His own Bleſſed Mouth in ſo ſolemn a Manner, our Faith is exempt from all ſuſpicion of <hi>Hyperboles,</hi> and the <hi>Honours</hi> given to St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> muſt be his very True and Proper <hi>Elogium.</hi>

               <p>Two things there were, at which the World was ſcandaliz'd in our Saviour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others. The firſt, that he had told them, That to obtain Eternal Life, they muſt <hi>eat his Fleſh</hi> and <hi>drink his Blood,</hi> which they could not hear without <hi>Horrour.</hi> The Second, That he made himſelf the <hi>Son of God,</hi> which they look'd upon as the greateſt of Blaſphemies. And by whom was <hi>his Honour</hi> vindicated in both theſe Points, but by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in the two moſt Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious <hi>Confeſſions</hi> he made of theſe two great Myſteries of our Faith: The Firſt, of the neceſſity of the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real eating</hi> his Fleſh, and <hi>drinking</hi> his Blood, for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Everlaſting Life. The Second, Of his being the <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Natural Son</hi> of the <hi>Living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> he made of the <hi>Real Manducation</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> of our Lord, was <hi>firſt in time,</hi> is manifeſtly evinc'd from the ſeries of the Acts of our Saviour's Life, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55648:7"/>
by the Evangeliſts. For before his coming into the Coaſts of <hi>Caeſarea Philippi,</hi> where he propos'd the Queſtion to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, <hi>Whom do you ſay that I am?</hi> he had fed five thouſand Men, beſides Women and Children, with ſive Loaves and two Fiſhes, which Miracle St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſays, <note place="margin">Hom. 45. in Jo.</note> he purpoſely wrought before hand, by it, to prepare them to believe what he ſhould afterwards teach, concerning the giving them his own Body and Blood at his laſt Supper; <hi>Propterea id prius fecit miraculum</hi> &amp;c. and accordingly, ſeeing the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes <note place="margin">Jo. 6. 26.</note> follow him from place to place, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had eaten of the Loaves, and were filled,</hi> that is, with expectation of being ſtill ſo fed and entertain'd by him; he took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from thence to exhort them to labour for a much better <hi>Bread,</hi> which camedown from Heaven, and which he would give them, <hi>viz. His own Fleſh, which he would give for the Life of the World.</hi> At this, you know, how not only the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtrove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, ſaying, <hi>How can this Man give us his Fleſh to eat?</hi> but <hi>many</hi> of his own <hi>Diſciples</hi> alſo, were ſo ſcandaliz'd, that they withdrew themſelves from his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55648:8"/>
and would have no more to do with a Teacher of ſo <hi>abſurd</hi> a <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and Commander of ſo <hi>horrible a Practice.</hi> And this too, after they had heard him ſay, <hi>The Fleſh profiteth nothing; The words that I ſpeak unto you, are Spirit and Life.</hi> Rather it was upon hearing theſe very words, and underſtanding them to be a confirmation of what he had ſaid before, that <hi>they went back, and walked no more with him.</hi> And is not all this an evident Sign, that they underſtood him to ſpeak of giving them his very <hi>true Fleſh</hi> to eat? Otherwiſe, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they would not have quitted him, nor call'd it a <hi>hard Saying,</hi> that he ſhould <hi>ſay</hi> his <hi>Fleſh was Bread,</hi> any more than they did, when they heard him ſay, He was a <hi>Vine</hi> or a <hi>Door.</hi> Nor was it a leſs evident Sign, that our Lord <hi>himſelf</hi> alſo meant, as he ſaid, that is, to give them his <hi>Fleſh</hi> to eat in very deed; how eaſie had it been for him, and how would his <hi>Goodneſs, (that Goodneſs</hi> which brought him down from Heaven to ſave Sinners) have mov'd him in this, as in other Occaſions it had done, to have bid them not to be ſcandaliz'd at what he had ſaid of giving them his Fleſh
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55648:8"/>
to eat, for that it was ſpoken only in a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi> and that he intended no more by it, than to give them <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> as a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> in remembrance of him? This, I ſay, had been very <hi>eaſie</hi> for him to do, and ſurely well becoming him, who came down from Heaven to <hi>ſeek</hi> what was <hi>loſt,</hi> and not to <hi>drive</hi> away what was found: And his not doing it, but reprehending them for <hi>not believing,</hi> and permitting them to depart in their unbelief, <note place="margin">John 6. 64</note> is a convincing Argument, that both he ſpake, and they underſtood him to ſpeak of the giving his <hi>true Fleſh</hi> to be eaten by them. This being ſo, our deareſt <hi>Lord</hi> ſolicitous now for the <hi>Twelve,</hi> whom he had choſen <note place="margin">Marc. 3. 14.</note> to be conſtantly <hi>with him,</hi> and to ſend them forth as occaſion ſerv'd, to <hi>Preach</hi> to others, Addreſſes himſelf to them with thoſe words full of Tenderneſs and Love, <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid &amp; vos vultis abire?

               <p>'TIs no very unuſual thing among Men, to meet with <hi>Titles</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi> without any thing correſpondent in the Subject to ſupport them: And the Reaſon is, Becauſe it is in the Power of <hi>Princes</hi> to give <hi>Titles,</hi> but not to give <hi>fit qualifications</hi> for them; nor yet always to diſcern, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Perſon be really endow'd with them or no.

And this St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſhews to have been our Saviour's meaning, by the Example he immediately ſubjoyns, That <hi>as our Lord communicated Light to his Apoſtles,</hi> that they might be called <hi>the Light of the World, and the like, in other Names or Titles they received from him,</hi> as of the Salt of the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In like manner <hi>alſo to Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, who believ'd in Chriſt the Rock, he gave the Name of Peter.</hi> And then concludes, that <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Metaphor of a Rock—Recte di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur ei; It is rightly and properly ſaid to him,</hi> that is, <hi>to Peter, Aedificabo Eccleſiam meam</hi>

               <p>This is the Diſcourſe of that great and famous Doctor St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> by which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that our Saviour, when he gave to <hi>Simon</hi> the Name of <hi>Peter,</hi> that is, <hi>a Rock</hi> made him the <hi>Rock</hi> on which he would build his Church, and that in a more Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent manner than any other of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as is every where affirm'd by the ſame holy Doctor, giving him the Titles of <hi>Prince, Chief, Head,</hi> and <hi>Greateſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles:</hi> And this very agreeably to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning of S. <hi>Paul</hi> in a Point of much higher Concern, in his firſt Chapter to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews.</hi> There this great Apoſtle being to prove, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord tranſcended all the Quires of Angels in the <hi>Excellency</hi> of his Nature, thought it a convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to alledge, that he had obtain'd a more <hi>Excellent name than they,</hi> foraſmuch <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 4.</note> as our <hi>Lord</hi> had ſaid to <hi>him,</hi> and to none of <hi>them,</hi> in the ſecond Pſalm, <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> And thoſe muſt think this Argument of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to be of no force, who when they hear our Saviour ſay to <hi>Simon the Son of Jonas,</hi> and to none other of his Apoſtles, <hi>Thou art</hi>

The Firſt by St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> c. 10. v. 2. The Second by St. <hi>Mark,</hi> c. 3. v. 16. The Third by St. <hi>Luke,</hi> c. 6. v. 14. And the Fourth by the ſame St. <hi>Luke,</hi> in the 1. c. of the Acts of the Apoſtles, v. 13. For altho' St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi> were before St. <hi>Peter</hi> in divers reſpects, as in <hi>Age,</hi> being (according to St. <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius)</hi> his <hi>Elder Brother;</hi> and alſo in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Haer. 51.</note> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (for St. <hi>John</hi> ſays of him, that <note place="margin">Jo. 1. 41.</note> he went and found out <hi>Peter</hi> and brought him to <hi>Chriſt)</hi> yet <hi>Peter</hi> by all the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> is evermore ſet before <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,</hi> and all the reſt of the Apoſtles. And St. <hi>Matthew</hi> (himſelf one of the Twelve) not only puts him in the <hi>firſt Place,</hi> but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly gives him the Title of <hi>Primus. The Names of the twelve Apoſtles,</hi> ſays he, are <note place="margin">Matt. 10. 2.</note> theſe; <hi>Primus, The Firſt, Simon, who is called</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:55648:14"/>
                  <hi>Peter.</hi> And why was this? to obſerve only the order of numbring? No: For then after he had ſaid, <hi>Primus, The Firſt, Simon, who is called Peter,</hi> he would have gone for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with, <hi>The Second, Andrew; the Third, James; the Fourth, John;</hi> and ſo of the reſt to the end. But whereas he do's not do this, but ſets down their <hi>Names,</hi> as it were in a <hi>Liſt</hi> one after another, without any Particle to ſignifie <hi>Precedency</hi> in one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another, and only adds the Title of <hi>Primus</hi> to <hi>Peter,</hi> 'tis a manifeſt Indication, that the <hi>Word</hi> was us'd by him to ſignifie <hi>Peter</hi> to be not only the Firſt in <hi>Order,</hi> nor yet in <hi>Place,</hi> but the <hi>Chief</hi> alſo in <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> among them; as when we ſay of a <hi>Foundation,</hi> (which <hi>S. Peter</hi> was) that it is the <hi>Firſt</hi> thing in a Building, the meaning is not, that it is ſo only in <hi>Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi> of <hi>Time</hi> or <hi>Place,</hi> but in regard of the <hi>Preeminence</hi> it hath of Firmneſs and Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity in order to the reſt of the Building, which is to be ſuſtained by it.</p>
               <p>And this is yet farther confirm'd from another remarkable Circumſtance in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid <hi>Catalogues,</hi> which is, that whereas the <hi>other Apoſtles</hi> are never nam'd in <hi>order,</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:55648:15"/>

Hierom</hi> calls him, <hi>Maximus,</hi> the <hi>Greateſt</hi> of the Apoſtles in <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Authority;</hi> in like manner as <hi>S.

in the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> and Enormity of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               <p>But that which muſt needs weigh down the Scale in this matter, with all imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally-conſidering Men, is the <hi>ſolemn Promiſe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 19.</note> (and no leſs <hi>ſolemn Performance)</hi> which our Saviour made to <hi>St. Peter,</hi> and to him alone, that he would give to <hi>him</hi> the <hi>Keys</hi> of the Kingdom of Heaven: <hi>Tibi dabo Claves Regni Coelorum; To thee will I give the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And what was this, but the <hi>Supreme Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of Governing his Church? For the word <hi>Keys</hi> being a metaphorical Expreſſion, is frequently us'd in the Holy Scripture to ſignifie that <hi>Superiority</hi> or Supreme Power with which a Perſon is inveſted to Govern a <hi>Family,</hi> a <hi>City,</hi> or a <hi>Kingdom;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when a <hi>City</hi> is ſurrendred, 'tis the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Cuſtom to deliver up the <hi>Keys</hi> to the <hi>Prince,</hi> or Principal Perſon, in acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his <hi>Power,</hi> and as a ſign of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> to it.

               <p>And when did our <hi>Lord</hi> perform <hi>this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> but when, a little before his Aſcenſion into Heaven, being now to withdraw his own <hi>Viſible Preſence</hi> from his Church, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a <hi>ſecond</hi> Examination, or, as <hi>Origen</hi> calls it, <hi>Confeſſion</hi> how much he lov'd him, and this in the preſence of the reſt of the Diſciples, <hi>he deliver'd</hi> to him, as the ſame <hi>Origen</hi> expreſſes it, (in his Fifth Book upon <note place="margin">In Ep. ad Rom. c. 6. l. 5.</note> the Sixth Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> which St. <hi>Hierom</hi> thought worthy his tranſlating) <hi>Summam rerum de paſcendis ovibus, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Charge</hi> or <hi>Superintendency</hi> of things, in order to the feeding of his Flock; not only of his <hi>Lambs,</hi> but of his <hi>Sheep;</hi> in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55648:17"/>
which Expreſſions <hi>all</hi> the Faithful, of what Degree or Preeminence ſoever, are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? And to take away all ſuſpicion as if he meant not to give him an Authority <hi>above</hi> that of the reſt of his Brethren, he ask'd him not only if he <hi>lov'd</hi> him, but if he did not love him <hi>more than They;</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly declaring, by the <hi>Exceſs</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> he requir'd from him, a proportionable <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs</hi> or Superiority in the <hi>Power</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him.</p>
               <p>Nor was <hi>this</hi> any way <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with their being <hi>All Equal,</hi> as they were <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> (in which regard it is, that S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi> and others, affirm them to have been ſo.) But on the contrary it was neceſſary, that one ſhould be endow'd with a <hi>Preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi> of Authority above the reſt, for the preſervation of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and conſequently of the <hi>Church,</hi> its <hi>Safety</hi> conſiſting in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> its <hi>Ruin</hi> in <hi>Diviſion,</hi> according to the known Saying of our Saviour, <hi>Every Kingdom di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt it ſelf, ſhall be brought to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 12. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>and every City or Houſe divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it ſelf, ſhall not ſtand.</hi> And this is the Reaſon which S. <hi>Hierom</hi> gives, (with whom <note place="margin">Lib. 1. adv. Jovinian.</note> the reſt of the <hi>Fathers</hi> agree) why One
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55648:17"/>

               </p>
               <p>And now to advance one ſtep farther, and ſo draw to a Concluſion: If it be <hi>true,</hi> as moſt certainly it is, what our Saviour ſaid, that <hi>Every Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf, ſhall be brought to ruin;</hi> and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, that <hi>The Gates of Hell ſhall never prevail againſt his Church,</hi> which is his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, it manifeſtly follows, That as <hi>the Church</hi> is to <hi>continue</hi> for ever, ſo alſo the <hi>Authority</hi> given to <hi>Peter</hi> was not to die with him, but to deſcend to <hi>his Succeſſors,</hi> and to remain for ever in the <hi>Chair of Peter.</hi> Of which <hi>Chair</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaking, ſays, <note place="margin">In Pſal. cont. part.

Hierom,</hi> when three unhappy <note place="margin">Ep. 56. ad Damaſ.</note> Factions brake out at the ſame time, and each endeavour'd to gain him to their Party, cries out to them, <hi>Si quis Cathedrae Petri jungitur, meus eſt; Let me know which of you holds Communion with the Chair of Peter,</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:55648:18"/>
                  <hi>and him I ſhall acknowledge for mine:</hi> Super illam Petram aedificatam Eccleſiam ſcio; <note place="margin">Id. Ep. 58.</note> 
                  <hi>I know the Church to be built upon that Rock.</hi> I know, that <hi>whoſoever eateth the Lamb out of that Houſe is Prophane, and whoſoever ſhall not be in the Ark of Noe, when the Deluge comes,</hi> peribit regnante diluvio, <hi>ſhall periſh in the Waters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some perhaps may think this to be a <hi>dreadful</hi> Saying, and ſo indeed it is: for as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays, <hi>Nihil ſic debet formidare Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus, quam</hi>

The Spirit quickens only the Members which are united to the Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How much then are <hi>They</hi> bound to give thanks to Almighty God, whoſe <hi>good Lot</hi> it has been, either to have been brought up from their Infancy in the <hi>Communion</hi> of this <hi>Chair,</hi> upon which the <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>built,</hi> or after having been bred otherwiſe, to have been <hi>powerfully,</hi> and yet <hi>ſweetly</hi> drawn

               <p>Firſt then, by being Members of this Holy Communion, it is, as the ſame <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
