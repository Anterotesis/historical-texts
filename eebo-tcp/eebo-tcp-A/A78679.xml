            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MY Lords and Gentlemen: It is no ſmall comfort to me, that my Native Country hath ſo true a ſenſe of my preſent Condition, as I find expreſſed by your Letter of the eight of this Month, and your Declaration, both which I received upon Friday laſt, and the ſame reaſon which makes you Diſcreetly and Generouſly at this time, forbear to preſſe any thing to me, hinders me likewiſe to make any particular Profeſſions unto you, left it may be imagined that deſire of liberty ſhould now be the only Secretary to my thoughts: Yet thus much I cannot but ſay; that, as in all humane Reaſon, nothing but a <hi>free Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall Treaty</hi> with me, can ſettle the unhappy Diſtractions of theſe diſtreſſed Kingdomes: So, if that could once be had, I would not doubt, but, that (by the grace of God) a happy Peace would ſoon follow. Such force (I believe) true Reaſon has in the hearts of all Men, when it may be clearly and calmly heard; and I am not aſhamed, at all times, to profeſſe, that it hath, and ſo ſhall be alwayes want of underſtanding, not of will, if I do not yeeld to Reaſon whenſoever, and from whomſoever I hear it; and it were a ſtrange thing, if Reaſon ſhould be leſſe eſteemed becauſe it comes from me, which (truly) I doe not expect from you: your Declaration ſeeming to me, (and I hope your Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will prove that I am not deceived) to be ſo well grounded upon <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Juſtice;</hi> that albeit by way of opinion, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give a <hi>Placet</hi> to every Clauſe in it: Yet I am confident, upon a calme and friendly Debate, we ſhall very well agree. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; I cannot (for the preſent) better ſhew my thankfulneſſe to you, for the Generous and Loyall expreſſions of your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to me, then by giving you my honeſt and ſincere Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; which is, Really and Conſtanſtly, without ſeeking private Ends, to purſue the Publicke profeſſions in your Declaration, as ſincere Chriſtians &amp; good Subjects ought to do, alwaies remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, that as the beſt foundation of Loyalty is Chriſtianity; So true Chriſtianity teaches perfect Loyalty, for without this Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procation, neither is truely what they pretend to be: But I am both confident that needs not to you, as likewiſe that you will rightly underſtand this, which is affectionatly intended by</p>
