            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It was a very large City, and the Metropolis of all <hi>Persia,</hi> two of the gates standing twelve miles asunder, which shews what the circuit of it was, when in her beauty and bravery. On the South side was a stately and magnificent Pallace, built by King <hi>Cyrus:</hi> On the North side stood a mighty strong Castle, which was girt about with three walls: The first wall was four and twenty foot high, adorned and beautified with many turrets and spires: The second was like the first, but twice as high: And the third was foursquare, being ninety foot high; all built of polished Marble: On each side of the City were twelve brasen gates, with brasen Pales set before them very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously wrought. On the East arose amiably an Hill of four Acres, in which, in stately <hi>Mausoleum's,</hi> were entombed the Monarchs of the VVorld. Many rare and admirable buildings it had, amongst which the glorious Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> was the most exquisite for Art, and materials in the VVorld: The stones were of the richest Marble and Porphery, the roof of refined gold. The Pallace Royal was cut out of the Marble Rock, above two miles in compasse: the roof and windows were of Gold, Silver, Amber, and Ivory: The Seate within was of Gold, and Oriental glittering Gems: In one room was an artificial Vine, the stalk of pure Gold, the clusters of Grapes of Pearls and Carbuncles: His bolster was valued at five thousand Talents of Gold; the footstool worth three thousand Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents: so that when the greedy <hi>Greeks</hi> had pillaged three dayes, yet <hi>Alexander</hi> had for his share seventy two millions of Crowns of Gold: besides hee loaded away three thousand Mules, with two and thirty millions, and seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds in Coin.

The Midan, or great Market-place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is the most spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, pleasant and Aromatick Market in the VVorld: a thousand pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from North to South, the other way above two hundred, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling

our <hi>Exchange:</hi> the building is of Brick, well made, and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in a most delightful manner; the inside is full of shops, each shop full of ware, arched above, a top framed Tarrase-wise: and cemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with excellent plaister, its placed in the heart of this triumphant City. The Kings Pallace joyns to the West side of it, possessing a large quantity of ground backward, though to the street side it hath no magnifick front; her best bravery being in the trim pargetting and painting with Azure and Gold, in Mosaick and Antick sort, interlaced with Poesies of <hi>Arabick:</hi> But within, the rooms are arched, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened with curious trellizes: the roof embossed with red, white, blew, and gold, the sides with sports, and painted Images: the ground spread with rich and curious Carpets of Silk and Gold. Tarrased above, garnished with a very high Tower, excellent for view; and breathing. The Wildernesse behinde is filled with all sorts of birds, priviledged from hurt, or affrights, who return their thanks in a sweet melodious consort. The North Isle of the Midan, contains eight or nine arched rooms, hung with Lamps and Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks, which being lighted, gives a curious splendor.</p>
               <p>Opposite to this Pallace is a fair Mosque, in form round, and within distinguished into Isles; the walls are lined fifteen foot high from the ground with white, and well polisht Marble, without pews or seats: In the midst is a stately Tank, or Pond, and at the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal another eightsquare, filled with Christal streams of water, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all <hi>Musslemen</hi> wash their hands, armes, eyes, &amp;c. as an operative work to purge sin, and confer devotion.</p>
               <p>In the Midan the shops bee uniform, the Trades are no where se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; all the Mercers together, the Lapidaries together, &amp;c. but most of them are of gums, drugs, and spices so sweet and delicate as can bee imagined.</p>
               <p>The Hummums or Sudatories are many, and very beautiful, some square, but most round, made of white stone polished, and durable; the windows are large without, and narrower within, the glasse is thick, and dark: the top round, tyled with a counterfeit Turquoise, perfectly blew, fresh and lasting; they are divided into many rooms, some for delight, and others for sweating: the paving all pure black Marble: Men use them in the morning, women towards night. Tis their <hi>Catholicon</hi> against all diseases, colds, catarrhes, flegme, aches, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The City is Oval, each house made pleasant by large Cypresse Gardens. The <hi>Seraglio</hi> for his women, is full of precious treasures, and more precious beauties, but not to bee seen. The Castle is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large, well walled, and deeply moated. The City hath so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pleasant Gardens, that at a distance you would take it for a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, so sweet, you would call it a Paradise: I shall only describe one of them excelling all others.</p>
               <p>Going from the Midan, you passe through an even delicate street two miles long, most part of the way walled on both sides, bedecked with Summer-houses, but more remarkable in that abundance of

green, broad spreading Chenore Trees, yeelding shade, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable order and beauty. The Garden is circled with a stately wall, three miles in compasse, entred by three gallant and curious gates. From North to South it is one thousand paces; from East to West seven hundred: from one end to the other easily seen by reason of a fair large Alley, running all along in parallel, distinguished into nine ascents, each surmounting other a foot, each distance smooth and even. In the Center is a spacious Tank, made into twelve equal sides, each side being five foot, set round with pipes of lead, which spout out water in variety of conceits and postures, which sort of pastime continues thence to the North gate, where is raised a house of pleasure, antickly garnished without, within divided into four or six Chambers: the lower is set out with Tanks of rich white Marble, and fumes out a cool Breese: the higher rooms are garnished with variety of Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skips, representing their sports of hunting, hawking, fishing, riding, shooting, wrestling, and other fancies: the seeling is inriched with beaten gold, imbost with Azure. From her Tarrasses is a dainty prospect of most part of the City. This Garden is replenished with trees of all sorts, for fruit, shade, and medicine: All so green, so sweet, so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, as may well bee tearmed a Compendium of Sense-ravishing delights.</p>
               <p>Within the City is a Column or Pillar, at the base twenty foot round, and sixty foot high, made of the heads of men and beasts: the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of this was <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1500. when <hi>Tamas Shaw</hi> ruled <hi>Persia,</hi> being much troubled with <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> these Citizens refused not only to contribute to his Wars, but denyed him enterance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon hee vowed revenge, entred the City by force, and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding age, or sex, slew three hundred thousand of them; and of their heads made this Pillar, as a Trophee of his victory, and their basenesse.</p>

From thence they were led into another large square upper Room, where the roof was formed into an Artificial Element, many golden Planets attracting the wandring eye to help their Motion: The ground was covered with far richer Carpets than the other: the Tank was larger: the matter, Jasper; and Porphiry: the silver purling-stream was forced up into another Region, yet seemed here to bubble wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly as in her proper Center: about it was so much gold in ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels for use, and oftentation, that some Merchants with them, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it worth twenty millions of pounds sterling: Another Tank there was incircled with a wall of Gold, and richest Gems: No other Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, Cups, nor other vessels were there but what were thick, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red over with Diamonds, Rubies, Pearls, Emeralds, Turquises, Jacinths, &amp;c.

The ground in this room was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with such Carpets as befitted the Monarch of <hi>Persia</hi>: Above sixty of the greatest Nobles sat round about it, cross-legged with their bums to the ground, and their backs to the wall, like so many statues, their eyes fixed on a constant object; not daring to speak, sneese, Cough, spit, &amp;c. in the Emperors presence.

               <p>The Noble and simple are all apparelled alike for the fashion, only differing in the finenesse of the cloth, which is of Bombast: First they have a shirt of white Bombast; then another painted cloth which they binde up betwixt their legs, and on their heads they wrap an other cloth in fashion of a Miter: they go all barefooted: all sorts of women wear a smock that reacheth to their middle, and from thence downward they wear a cloth open before, so that they cannot go but they discover natures secrets, which they say was invented to keep men from sin against nature; they go also barefooted, having their arms adorned with hoopes of gold, and Jewels, and their fingers full of precious rings.</p>

In the winter quarter they fast from food; all the rest of the year devour their prey with much greedinesse; sixty dayes passe before the female layes her eggs, which are commonly sixty in number, and shee is sixty dayes in hatching them, and usually they live sixty years: some call them <hi>Aligartos.</hi> The <hi>Jchneumon</hi> steals into his belly, and gnaws in sunder his guts whilst hee lies gaping that the little <hi>Trochil</hi> may pick his teeth, which gives it feeding.</p>

                  <hi>Quinsay</hi> was formerly the Regal City of <hi>China,</hi> situated abuut the heart of the Country, and yet not far from the Sea: In it were to bee found so many delights, that it seemed an earthly Paradise: It was one hundred miles in compasse, for the streets, and channels there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were very wide, and the Market-places very large. It had on the one side, a clear lake of fresh water, and on the other, a great River, which entring into many places of the City carryed away all the filth, and occasioned a good air. There were store both of Carts, and Barks to carry necessaries. It had in it twelve thousand Bridges, great and small; those on the chiefest Channels being so high, that ships might passe under them. On the other side of the City was a great Trench forty miles long, large, and full of water from the River, which served both to receive the overflowings of the River, and as a fence to that side of the City, the earth, that was taken out, being laid as a bank, or hill on the inside. There are ten chief Market-places (besides infinite others along the streets) all of them square, the square being half a mile on each side, and from the fore part of them runs a principal street forty paces wide, reaching from one end of the City to the other, with many Bridges traversing of it; and at the end of every four miles is such a Market-place. There is also a large channel running over against the street behinde the Market-places, on the banks whereof are erected store-houses of stone, where Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants out of all Countries laid up their Commodities, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious to the Markets. In each of the Market-places three dayes in a week was a concourse of forty, or fifty thousand persons which brought in whatsoever was requisite for the life of man, besides beasts, and fowls of game. Then followed the Butchers rows of Beef,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103995:25"/>
Veal, Kid, and Lamb: Besides there were all sorts of Herbs; and fruits, and amongst them huge Pears weighing ten pound a peece, and very fragrant: Peaches yellow, and white, very delicate. Every day from the Ocean, which is but five and twenty miles off, is brought up abundance of fish, besides what the Lake and River yeeld. All the Market-places are encompassed with high and fair houses, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath are shops of Artificers, and all sorts of Merchandises, Spices, Jewels, Pearls, Rice-wine, &amp;c. Many streets answer one another in those Market-places, wherein are many Bathes, both of cold, and hot waters, and people wash every day before they eat any thing. At the end of each Market-place is a Palace where Magistrates determine all controversies which happen amongst Merchants and others.</p>
               <p>There are twelve Principal trades, each of which have one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand shops, and yee shall see in every shop ten, twenty, thirty, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men at work under one Master. The Masters themselves work not, but stand richly apparreled, and their wives with Jewels inestimable: their houses are well ordered, and richly adorned with Pictures, and other stupendious costs.</p>
               <p>About the Lake are many fair buildings, and great Palaces of the Nobles, and chief men; and Temples of their Idols, and Monasteries of many Monks. In the middest of the Lake are two Islands, upon each of which is a Palace with incredible numbers of rooms, whither they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort upon occasions of marriages, or other feasts, where are provisions of Vessels, Nappery, and other things, kept in common for such pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses. In the Lake also are Boats and Barges, for pleasure, adorned with fair seats, and Tables, and other provision for banquets, covered over head: within they are neatly painted, and have windows to open, and shut at pleasure. Nor can any thing in the World seem more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, than from the Lake to have such a prospect, the City so fully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting it self to the eye, with so many Temples, Monasterys, Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Gardens with high trees, Barges, People, &amp;c.

Goats, with whose Milk they make much Butter, and Cheese<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they have store of Bufelo's that give good milk: Its a very large Beast, having a smooth thick skin without hair. They have store of red Deer, fallow Deer, Elks, and Antilops, which are good Venison; and every mans Game, not being enclosed in Parks. They have Geese, Ducks, Pigeons, Partridges, Quails, Peacocks, and many other sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular good fowl: a sheep is usually sold for twelve pence, four couple of Hens for twelve pence: A Hare for a penny, three Partridges for a penny, &amp;c.

For three months they have abundance of rain, with much thunder, and lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: the other nine months so clear, that a cloud is scarce to bee seen.</p>
               <p>The Country is beautified with many woods, and great variety of fair goodly trees, some having leaves as big as bucklers, others parted small as Fern, as the <hi>Tamarine</hi> trees that bear a sower fruit; somewhat like our Beans, very good to cool, and cleanse the blood: all their trees are green all the year about. There are rare flowers of admirable colours, but few of them sweet, save their Roses, and two or three more sorts.</p>
               <p>The Country is watered with many goodly Rivers, especially <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> and <hi>Ganges</hi>; besides which, they have store of springs, upon many of which they bestow great cost of stonework, making Tanks, or Ponds, some of them a mile in compasse, others more, surroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with stone walls, and within them fair stone steps round about. Some of them are filled with rain water. They have a strong drink called Rack, distilled from Sugar, and the spicie rind of a tree called <hi>Jagra</hi>: they have also Cohha made with a black seed boiled in water, that helps digestion, quickens the spirits, cleanses the blood, and provokes lust. Many of their houses are flat on the top, on which in the cool seasons of the day, they take the cool air: they have no chimnies, using no fire, but only to dresse their meat. The upper rooms have many lights to let in air, but they use no glasse: Amongst their houses are many fair trees, which are a great defence against the Sun. Most of their houses in the Cities are of Brick, or stone, well squared. Their staple commodities are Indico, and Cotton-wool, of which they make diverse sorts of cloth, some finer, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer than our best Lawns: some of it they staine in variety of curious figures. They have also store of Silk, which they weave curiously, sometimes with gold, and silver, whereof they make Velvets.

               <p>They have store of good Horses, and Camels, Dromedaries, Mules; Asses, Rhynocerots; which are as long as the fairest Oxe in <hi>England,</hi> their skines lye plaited in wrinkles on their backs. They have many Elephants, their King having usually fourteen thousand, and many of the Nobles a hunded a peece: There are some of them fifteen foot high, all of them black, their skin thick, and smooth, without hair: they take much delight in the water, and will swim excellent well, they are exceeding docible, so that they will do almost any thing the keeper bids them: If he would have them affright a man; he will make towards him as if hee would tread him in peeces, and yet when hee comes to him, not touch him. If hee bid him abuse a man, hee will take dirt, or kennel water in his trunk, and dash it in his face; &amp;c. They are most sure of foot, never stumbling: they are governed with a hook of steel, with which their keeper sitting on their Necks, pull them back, or prick them forward at their pleasure. Every Male hath allowed to him four females.</p>

               <p>The Inhabitants before they were conquered by <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> were all <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but now they are mixed with <hi>Mahometans:</hi> they are of stature, like us, very streight, seldome or never is there a crooked person amongst them: They are of an Olive colour, have black hair, but not curled; they love not any that are white, saying that they are like Lepers, their chins are bare, but have long hair on their upper lips, shave their heads; only reserve a lock on the Crown for <hi>Mahomet</hi> to pull them to heaven by. The habits of men and women differ little, mostly made of white Cotton cloth, made close to the middle, then hanging loose down below the knee: under them they have long breeches reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ancle, and close to their bodies: their feet are bare in their shooes, which they commonly wear like Slippers, which they put off when they come into their houses, whose floores are covered with excellent Carpets, upon which they sit when they talk or eat, like Taylors on their shop boards: on the mens heads are shashes, which is a long thin wreath of cloath, white or coloured. The <hi>Mahometan</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:103995:27"/>
women cover their heads with vails, their hair hangs down behind twist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with silk: oft bedecked with jewels, about their necks and wrists: their ears have pendants: their nostrils pierced to put in rings at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: Their ease in child bearing is admirable: for it is a common thing there, for women great with child, one day to ride carrying their Infants in their bodies, and the next day to ride carrying them in their arms.</p>
               <p>The great <hi>Mogol,</hi> every year at the entring of the Sun into <hi>Aries,</hi> makes a feast to his Nobles which lasts nine days, at which time they present him with gifts, and he again repays them with Princely rewards: I was astonished (saith mine Author, who was an eye witnesse of it) when I beheld at that time the incredible riches of gold, pearls, Pretious stones, jewels, and many other glittering vanities which were amongst them.</p>
               <p>The walls in the Kings house are painted, or beautified with pure white Lime: the floores are covered with rich, and costly Carpets: there lodge none with him in his house but his Eunuches, and women, and some little boys, that hee keeps for detestable uses: hee always eats in private amongst his women, upon great variety of excellent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, which being prepared, and proved by the Taster, are served up in vessels of Gold covered, and sealed up, and so by the Eunuches brought to him.</p>
               <p>In this Empire there are no Inns to entertain strangers, onely in great Towns are fair houses built for their receit, which they call <hi>Sarrays,</hi> not inhabited, where Travellers have room freely, but they must bring with them beds, food, and other necessaries which they usually carry upon Camells, or in Carts drawn with Oxen, wherein they have tents to pitch when they meet with no <hi>Sarray's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The inferior sort of people ride upon Oxen, Horses, Mules, Camels, or Dromedaries, and the women like unto the men, or else in slight Coaches drawn with Oxen, many whereof are white and large, and they are guided with cords, which go through the parting of their Nostrils, and so betwixt their horns, into the Coach-mans hands: they are nimble, and will go twenty miles a day. The better sort ride up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Elephants, or are carried on mens shoulders in Sedans, which they call <hi>Palankeenes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all their great Cities they have Markets twice a day, early in the morning, and in the evening; wherein they sell almost every thing by weight. They are generally so superstitious, that they will rather dye than eat, or drink any thing that their Law forbids.</p>

The height is the same with the breadth: <hi>viz.</hi> six hundred ninety three feet.</p>
               <p>The ascent to the top is contrived in this manner: From all the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103995:33"/>
sides without, the ascent is by degrees; the lowermost step or degree is about four foot in height, and three in breadth, which running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Pyramid</hi> in a level, makes on every side of it a long, but nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row walk; the second row is like the first, retiring inward from the first three feet, and so runs about the <hi>Pyramid.</hi> In the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is the third row placed above the second, and so in order the rest like so many stairs rising one above another to the top, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains about nine foot square. The degrees by which men ascend are not all of an equal depth, for some are about four foot, others scarcely three, and the higher they ascend, the more they diminish, both in breadth, and thicknesse: so that a right line extended from any part of the <hi>Basis</hi> to the top, will equally touch the outward angle of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry degree.</p>
               <p>These are all made of Massie, and polished stones, hewn out of the <hi>Arabian</hi> Mountains, which bound the upper part of <hi>Egypt,</hi> being so vast, that the breadth and depth of every step, is one single and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire stone, so that in most of them is contained thirty feet of stone: The number of these steps is two hundred and seven.</p>
               <p>On the North side ascending thirty eight feet upon an artificial bank of earth, there is a square, and narrow passage, leading into the inside of this <hi>Pyramid,</hi> containing in length ninety two feet, and an half: The structure of it hath been the labour of an exquisite hand, as appears by the smoothnesse and evennesse of the work, and by the close knitting of the joynts: it is now an habitation for great ugly batts of about a foot long.</p>
               <p>At the end of this entrance you must climb up a massy stone, eight or nine foot in height, where you enter into a Gallery, the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment consisting of smooth, and polished white Marble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the breadth is about five foot, and the height the like: the length of this Gallery is an hundred, and ten feet: At the end whereof begins a second Gallery, a very stately peece of work, and not inferiour either in respect of the curiousity of Art, or richnesse of materials, to the most sumptuous or magnificent buildings: Its divided from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer by a wall; at the end whereof is a Well about three feet in the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, the sides whereof are lined with white Marble, its eighty six cubits in depth, hewn through the Rock on which the <hi>Pyramid</hi> stands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Beyond the Well about fifteen foot is a square passage, the stones whereof are exceeding massie, and exquisitely joyned, which contains one hundred and ten feet, at the end whereof is an arched Vault, or little Chamber; the length about twenty feet, the breadth seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, the height about fifteen.</p>

The stones which cover this room are of a strange, and stupendious length, like so many huge beams ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flat, and traversing the room, and bearing up that infinite weight, and Masse of the <hi>Pyramid</hi> above. Of these there are nine which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the roof; the length of this room is thirty four <hi>English</hi> feet: the breadth somewhat above seventeen feet, the height nineteen feet and a half.</p>

               <p>The City of <hi>Fesse</hi> is both great, and strong: the soil about it, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versified with little Hills, and pretty vallies, which make it very pleasant: The River neer it disperseth it self into many channels, and when it enters into the City, it divideth it self into two arms, and these again are subdivided into variety of water-courses, passing through every street, and by pipes under ground is carried into eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Temple, Colledge, Inne, Hospital, and almost into every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate house, whereby it carrieth away all the silth that might annoy either the sight or sent. The buildings are of Mosaick-work, with fine bricks, and stones framed after a most curious manner, lovely for delight, and stately for admiration. The roofes of the houses are adorned with Gold, Azure, and other excellent colours: on the top they are flat for the Inhabitants use and pleasure: within they are richly furnished, every Chamber having in it a Presse curiously painted, and varnished. The Portals, Pillars, Cisterns, and other Ornaments of the City are very exquisitly framed: There are of Temples in it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout seven hundred, whereof fifty are very great, and fair, adorned with Marble Pillars, and other Ornaments, the Chapiters whereof are wrought with Mosaick and carved works: each of them hath his Fountain of Marble, and other costly stones: the floores are cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Mats closely joyned; the walls also for a mans height are lined with the same; every Temple hath its Steeple after the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan</hi> manner, whereon their Priests call the People to prayer at the appointed hours. The principal Temple is that of <hi>Caruven,</hi> so great, that it contains in circuit a mile, and a half. It hath thirty one Gates great and high: the Roof is one hundred and fifty <hi>Tuscan</hi> yards long, and neer fourscore broad. Its supported with thirty eight Arches in length, and twenty in breadth: Round about it are Porches on the East, West, and North, every one in length forty yards, and in breadth thirty, under which are store-houses, wherein are kept Lamps Oyle, Mats, and other necessaries: every night are lighted nine hundred Lamps, for every Arch hath his Lamp, especially that row which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends through the midst of the Quire, which alone hath one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Lamps: amongst which are some great lights made of Brasse, every of which hath sockets for one thousand five hundred Lamps: The Steeple is exceeding high. Not far from the City are twenty Lime-kills, and as many brick-kills, serving for the reparation of the Temple, and houses that belong to it. The revenues of this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are two hundred Duckets a day.</p>
               <p>In the City there are two Principal, and most stately Colledges, adorned with Mosaick, and carved works, paved with Marble, and stones of <hi>Majorca</hi>; in each of them are many Chambers: One of them containing above one hundred Chambers, is adorned with a goodly Fountain of Marble, and a continuall running stream: about it are three Cloisters, or Galleries of incredible beauty, supported with eight square
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103995:36"/>
Pillars of diverse colours: the Arches adorned with Mosaick of Gold, and Azure: the roof of carved work. The Gates of the Colledge are of Brass finely wrought, and the Chamber doors are well carved. In the great hall where they say their Prayers, is a Pulpit, ascended by nine stairs, all of Ivory, and Ebony.</p>
               <p>There are many Hospitals in <hi>Fesse</hi> not inferior to the Colledges for building: there are also a hundred Bath-stoves well built, each of them having four Halls, and certain Galleries without; in which they put off their cloaths, most of them pertaining to the Temples, and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and yeilding them a great rent.</p>
               <p>Their Inns are almost two hundred, built three stories high, each of them having one hundred and twenty Chambers in them, with Galleries before all the doors: but yeilding neither beds, nor food for strangers. There are also a thousand Mills, the revenues whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Temples, and Colledges. Each trade in <hi>Fesse</hi> hath a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar place allotted thereto. There are six hundred fountains walled about, which supply the Temples, and other places with water, because the River is sometimes dry.</p>
               <p>In the territories of <hi>Fesse</hi> is the City of <hi>Sella,</hi> where the buildings are of Mosaick work, supported with Marble Pillars.

The Town wherein the King dwels is seated on the River, compassed about with Hurdles ten foot high, and fastened to strong poles: On the outside is a Trench of great breadth, beyond which the Town is again circled with Posts, set close together of about five foot high: their Armes are Azegaies, or Javelins, made of Reeds six foot long, with an Iron Pike artificially made, and dangerous: they have others

that they cast like Darts, with barbed heads: as also swords about two foot long. Some have Bows and Arrows made of Reeds, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Iron poisoned: when any of them come to the King, they presently kneel down, and comming nearer, they lay their hands first upon the ground, then upon their head, then comming to him, they lay their hand with much submission upon the Kings thigh, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire back: the King answers them with nodding his head: They are generally cloathed in cloth made of Cotton, whereof there is plenty; their apparrel is a shirt to their knees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a pair of breeches; they are mostly bare-headed, their hair bedecked with <hi>Gregories,</hi> made of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of several fashions, which whilst they wear, they think that no evil can betide them.</p>

Few either of men or women are without Tobacco-pipes made of earth well glazed, about two inches long, the bowle will hold half an ounce of Tobacco: into these they put Reeds about a yard long, and so draw the smoak.</p>
               <p>They have store of Palmita wine: and gourds which grow like our Pumpions carryed up their walls, of unequal size, from an egge to a bushel, yeelding variety of houshold vessels to eat, drink, and wash cloaths in: they have store of great Locusts trees, which yeeld clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Cods, ripe in <hi>May,</hi> which they eat. They have store of Bees, and Honey. They have a sort of trees, which on a long stalk have a great and round fruit with a pleasing pith therein, on which Baboons and Monkeys feed. There is a tree or shrub commonly growing on the River bank like our great Briars, having a ragged leaf, which leaf with the gentlest stealing touch, betwixt the finger, and thumb, will make the whole bough to close up all his leaves, and the touch of a sprig, will cause the whole tree to close up all his leaves: It bears a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low flower like our Eglantines. There are many Lions, Jackals, Ouzes, and Leopards. The Civit-Cats, and Porcupins rob them of their Poultry. There are also abundance of Elephants, which going in companies spoil their Corn, and Cotton grounds: they feed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst sedges, and upon boughs of trees: the blacks eat their flesh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There are Deer of all sorts, Antilops, wild Bulls, and huge Bears.

               <p>At the Cape of <hi>Good Hope:</hi> the <hi>Africans</hi> are ugly black, strong-limmed, desperate, crafty, and injurious. Their heads are long, their hair woolly, and crispt; of which some shave one side, leaving the other long, and curled: Another shaves all, saving a little tuft on the top: Another (thinking his invention better) shaves here, and there, the bald skull appearing in many places: other some shave away all save a lock before. Such as have tufts of hair, hang in them brasse but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, spur rowels, peeces of Pewter, &amp;c. Their ears are long, and made longer by heavy bables they hang in them, as links of brass, or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, chains, glass-beads, blew-stones, bullets, or Oister-shels: and such as cannot reach to such Jewels, have singles of Dear, beaks of birds, Dogs or Cat stones, &amp;c. Their Noses are flat, crusht so in their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, their Lips great: quick, crafty eyes: and about their necks they have guts, or raw puddings, serving both for good and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The better sort instead of them get hoops of Iron, chains of brasse, or greazy thongs of stinking Leather: Their arms are loaden with voluntary shackles of Iron, Ivory, rusty brass, or musty Copper: the rest of their bodies are naked, saving that they are girded with a thong of raw Leather, to which is fastened, a square peece like the back

of a Glove to cover their privities: but the women, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing, return their gratitude by taking up that slap, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering their shame: But their great ones have better cloathing: A nasty untanned hide of a Lyon, Leopard, Calf, Baboon, or Sheep (the hair inward) which they put upon their shoulders, reaching to their wasts: for their thighs and legs are never covered: To their feet is fastened a broad peece of Leather, tyed by a little strap, which for the most part they hold in their hands, that their feet may have liberty to steal, which with their toes, they can do most cunningly, all the while looking you in the face, as if they meant no harm. Most of the men are semi-Eunuches, one stone being exsected in their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy by their nurses. Both sexes hideously cut, gash, and pink their brows, nose, cheeks, arms, breast, back, belly, thighs, and legs in sundry works, and Figures.

               <p>They feed, sleep, and speak altogether without order, or Law: In the night they sleep round a fire, a Centinel watching the Lyons, their adversaries: <hi>Vivitur ex rapto</hi>: the one eating the other, the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tearing some of them, and they other times training him over co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered pits, which catches him: and so they slay, and eat him to day, who perhaps was a Sepulcher to their friends, or parents the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. They dawb, and rub their skins with grease, and coals, inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and drying them in the Sun whereby they become Monsters to all civil eyes. They eat men alive, or dead, which when they fail of, dead Whales, Seals, Pengwins, grease, or raw puddings are their diet: and when the frost of old age benums their limbs, whereby they are unapt to provide their own food, they either eat them, or expose them upon the Mountains, either to bee killed by famine, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by Lyons.</p>

               <p>They have no spark of devotion, no knowledge of God, heaven, hell, or immortality; no place of worship, no day of rest, no order in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, no shame, no truth, no ceremony in births, or burials, meer brutish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and stupidity over shadowing them.

Formerly the Northern limit was a wall crosse the Island from <hi>Carlile</hi> in <hi>Cumberland</hi> to the River <hi>Tine.</hi> It was built by <hi>Severus</hi> as a fortresse against the <hi>Picts</hi>: at every miles end was a Castle; between every Castle many Watch-Towers, and through the walls of every Tower and Castle went a pipe of brasse, which from one Garrison to another conveyed the least noise without interruption: so that the intelligence of an invading enemy, was quickly made known to all the borders. VVhen the wall failed, the strong Townes of <hi>Berwick</hi> and <hi>Carlile</hi> were the chief bars against invasion.</p>
               <p>Its in length three hundred and twenty miles: concerning our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, they are thus reckoned up.</p>

               <p>Our women are the most beautiful in the world, without the help of any adulterate Sophistications. In a compleat woman, say the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> should bee the parts of a <hi>Dutch</hi> woman from the girdle down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:103995:49"/>
the parts of a <hi>French</hi> woman from the girdle to the shoulders, over which must bee placed an <hi>English</hi> face. And as their persons, so their priviledges are greater here than in any other Nation, they being not so servilely submiss as the <hi>French</hi>: nor so jealously guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as the <hi>Italians</hi>: hence <hi>England</hi> is called the <hi>Purgatory of servants, the hell of horses, and the Paradise of women.</hi> And the <hi>Italians</hi> common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say, <hi>that if there were a bridge built over the narrow Seas, all the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of</hi> Europe <hi>would runne into</hi> England: For here they have the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand in the streets, and at the Table, the thirds of their husbands estates: their equal shares in lands; priviledges wherewith women in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countrys are not acquainted.</p>
               <p>The wooll of <hi>England</hi> is excellent fine, especially that of <hi>Cotswold</hi> in <hi>Glocester shire,</hi> of <hi>Lemster</hi> in <hi>Hereford shire,</hi> and in the Ile of <hi>Wight.</hi> Of it, are made excellent broad-cloaths, which are dispersed all over the World, bringing in much money into the Realm, and setting on work so many poor people. And the giving of some <hi>Cotswold</hi> sheep by King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, to <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Castile, Anno Christi</hi> 1465. is counted one of the greatest prejudices that ever hapned to this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The wooll transported hath brought into us no lesse than one milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and five hundred thousand pound yearly, and our Lead half as much.</p>
               <p>Wee have more Parks in <hi>England</hi> than in all <hi>Europe</hi> besides. Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we had Chases thirty, Forrests fifty five, Parks seven hundred for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and five, replenished with abundance of Game.</p>
               <p>Our Mines are of Tin, Lead, and Coals. Beer wee have plenty, which being transported into <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Lowcountries,</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> is amongst them highly esteemed. We have so many well-tuned bells, that Forreigners have called it <hi>The Ringing Island.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Air is very temperate: No seas in <hi>Europe</hi> yeild more plenty of fish. Our Oisters were famous amongst the old <hi>Romans.</hi> Our Herrings yeild great profit to the <hi>Netherlanders.</hi> Our Nobility have not such unlimited power as in other Nations. Our commonalty live in far greater reputation than they do in other Countries, and have more civility in them.</p>
               <p>Our Ministry is learned and religious, and have a more practical, and powerful manner of Preaching than in any other Nation. Their printed works are so famous, that many young Schollers of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, come over on purpose to learn our language, that they may bee able to make use of our Books; they are also the best provided for of any Ministers in the reformed Churches.</p>
               <p>The Diet of <hi>England</hi> is for the most part flesh: In <hi>London</hi> alone there are slain and uttered, no fewer than sixty seven thousand and five hundred beefes, and six hundred seventy five thousand sheep, besides Calves, Lambs, Swine, and Poultry, in a year: I beleeve now farre more: The <hi>Spanish Gondamor</hi> when hee was here, having often seen our Shambles, said that there was more flesh here eaten in a month, than in all <hi>Spain</hi> in a year. A Forreigner comming to <hi>London,</hi> and seeing such multitudes of people in the streets, wondred where there could bee meat to fill so many bellies: but when hee had seen our
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103995:49"/>
Shambles, and markets, hee wondred where there could bee bellies to eat so much meat.</p>
               <p>Our Navy is called the walls of <hi>England,</hi> the like ships for ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice are not to bee found in the World, and our Marriners, and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers are not to bee equalled. In King <hi>Edward</hi> the third his time two hundred of our ships neer <hi>Scluse</hi> overcame four hundred of the <hi>French:</hi> of which they sunk two hundred sail, and slew thirty thousand Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. In eighty eight a few of our Queens ships overthrew the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Invincible Armado,</hi> consisting of one hundred thirty and four great Gallions: Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> with four ships, took from the <hi>Spaniard</hi> one million, and one hundred eighty nine thousand, and two hundred Duckats in his voyage <hi>Anno Christi.</hi> 1587. And again, with five and twenty ships hee awed the Ocean, sacked St. <hi>Jago, Domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> and <hi>Carthagena,</hi> bringing away with him besides much treasure, two hundred and forty peeces of Ordnance. Our Country men <hi>Drake,</hi> and <hi>Cavendish</hi> have sailed round about the World. I omit the voyage to <hi>Cales</hi> mentioned before. Sir <hi>Richard Creenvil</hi> in one of the Queens ships called the <hi>Revenge,</hi> wherein were but one hundred and fourscore Souldiers, and of them ninety so sick as not able to fight, yet maintained hee a Sea-fight for four and twenty hours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst above fifty of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Gallions, and though when his powder was spent to the last barrel, hee yeilded on honorable tearms, yet before, he had killed one thousand of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and sunk four of their greatest vessels. And what victories wee have had of late over all the Navies of the <hi>Lowcountries,</hi> I omit to speak of, because they are fresh in every ones memory. In land service our souldiers are able to endure, and resolute to undertake the hardest enterprises: witnesse our warres, and conquests in <hi>Spain, France, Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands</hi> assisted by us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>England</hi> is a most fertile, and a most potent Island, as well for si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, as for men and ships: and the Inhabitants are good souldiers both by sea and land, in valour and courage, not inferior to any one Nation whatsoever, and are more apt to offend by temerity, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermuch forwardnesse, than by cowardize, It excells all other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Mastiffs, Cocks of the Game, and Women, who are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably beautiful, and therefore have great influence upon the men: yea the Queens have commanded here more absolutely, and have been much better obeyed and respected, than the Kings.</p>
               <p>The division of <hi>England</hi> is into forty shires, and nine thousand seven hundred and twenty five Parishes, beside Chappels: In these are five hundred fourscore and five Market Towns, besides Cities: the chief are <hi>Shrewsbury, Northampton, South-hampton, Lecester, Warwick,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Our Universities are two, <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> which for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and beauty of Colledges, multitudes of Students, and largeness of revenues, are not to bee equalled in the Christian world. I will not determine which is of greater antiquity, this question having been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated by so many.</p>
               <p>In several places of <hi>England</hi> there is excellent white salt made: I
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103995:50"/>
shall describe the manner of the making of it at <hi>Nantwich</hi> only. There is one salt spring, which they call the <hi>Brine-pit,</hi> standing close by the River <hi>Weever,</hi> from whence the Brine is conveyed into the severall <hi>Wich-houses,</hi> and when the Bell rings, they begin to make fire under the Leads, wherein they boil the said salt-water, and as it seeths, the <hi>Wallers</hi> (which are commonly women) do with a woodden Rake gather the Salt from the bottome, which they put into long wicker baskets, and so the water voideth, and the Salt remains. In some other places they boil it in Iron pans with coals, but they say the salt is not so white.</p>

               <head>The Cities in <hi>England</hi> Described. The City of <hi>London</hi> Described.</head>
               <p>No Records set down the Original of this ancient City. A City it was when <hi>Caesar</hi> first entred <hi>Brittain,</hi> and by the Testimony of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus, Ptolemy,</hi> and <hi>Antonine,</hi> was called <hi>Londinium,</hi> and by <hi>Ammia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Marcellinus,</hi> for her successive prosperity, <hi>Augusta,</hi> the greatest title that can bee given to any. In regard of both elements it is most happy, as being situate in a most rich, and fertile soil, abounding with plenty, and store of all things, and on the gentle ascent, and rising of a hill hard by the <hi>Thames</hi> side, which by his safe and deep chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel is able to entertain the greatest ships, which daily bring in such store of rich Merchandise from all parts of the VVorld, that it striv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at this day with the Mart towns in Christendome for the second place, and affordeth a most sure, and beautiful rode for shipping. This City doth shew her self as the Cedar amongst shrubs: It was the seat of the British Kings, and is the model of the Land, and Mart of the World: For thither are brought the Silks of <hi>Asia,</hi> the Spices of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi> the Balms from <hi>Grecia,</hi> and the Riches from both the <hi>Indies.</hi> No City hath been so long famous, nor in civil Government can bee compared with her. Her walls were first built by <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, at the request of his mother <hi>Helena,</hi> reared with rough stone, and british brick, three <hi>English</hi> miles in compass: through which are seven fair Gates, besides posterns. A long the <hi>Thames</hi> this wall at first ranged with gates, the one <hi>Douregate,</hi> now <hi>Dowgate,</hi> the other <hi>Billingsgate,</hi> a receptacle for ships. In the middest of the City was set a mile mark (as the like was in <hi>Rome</hi> also) from whence they mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured their stations, which stands till this day, and is commonly known by the name of <hi>London stone.</hi> St. <hi>Peters</hi> in <hi>Cornhill</hi> is thought to have been the Cathedral of <hi>Restitutus,</hi> a Christian Bishop in <hi>Constantine</hi> the great's time, which was afterwards removed to St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> whose greatness exceeds all others, and spires had so high that twice they were consumed by lightning from heaven: It hath in it besides this Church, one hundred twenty and one Churches more, viz. ninety and six within the walls, and sixteen without, but within the liberties, and nine more in her suburbs. Its divided into six and twenty Wards, governed by so many Aldermen, a Lord Maior, and two Sheriffs, the yearly
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:103995:50"/>
choice whereof was granted them by Patent from King <hi>John</hi>: In whose time also a Bridge of stone was built over the <hi>Thames</hi> upon twenty Arches, built of excellent freestone, and each Arch being sixty foot high, and full twenty in distance from one another; so that for length, breadth, beauty, and building, the like is not again to be found in the world.</p>
               <p>King <hi>John</hi> gave certain void places in <hi>London</hi> to the City to build upon, and the profits thereof were to go toward the charges of building and repairing the same bridg: and the Mason who was the chief wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>kman in building it, erected a large chappel upon it, at his own charges, and largely endowed it, which is since turned to a dwelling house. It was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1209. having been thirty and three years in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Afterwards sundry beautiful houses were built upon it, that it seems a street rather than a bridge, and many charitable men have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en lands, houses, and summes of money towards the maintenance of it.</p>
               <p>At the East end of this City standeth the Tower: A most famous and goodly Citadel, encompassed round with thick, and strong walls full of lofty and stately Turrets, fenced with a broad and deep moat, furnished with a gallant Magazine of warlick Ammunition, and other buildings besides, so that it resembles a big town.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Church of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> an ancient writer saith, that it contains in length six hundred and ninety feet, the breadth thereof is one hundred and thirty foot; the height of the West arched roof from the ground is one hundred and two foot, and the new fabrick from the ground is eighty eight foot high. The stone work of the steeple, from the plain ground rose in height two hundred and sixty foot, and the Timber frame upon the same was two hundred seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and four foot high, the Spire before it was burnt down, was five hundred thirty and four foot high. About the time of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, when Musters were made of able men to bear arms, <hi>London</hi> brought into the field under their colours forty thousand foot men, and twenty thousand horsemen. It hath often, and is daily enlarged with new buildings, and spacious Suburbs stretched forth from the Gates a great length on every side, but Westward especially, which are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and best peopled: In which are twelve Inns for students of the Common Law. The four principal houses are the <hi>Inner Temple,</hi> the <hi>middle Temple, Grates Inn,</hi> and <hi>Lincolns Inn</hi>: six smaller belong to the Chancery: besides two Inns more for the Sergeants at Law.</p>
               <p>These Western Suburbs are so carried on, that they joyn to <hi>London</hi> another City called <hi>Westminster,</hi> famous for the Seat, and Sepulchre of our Kings, and for the Courts of justice kept every Tearm in <hi>Westminster</hi> Hall. No walls are built about this City: and those of <hi>London</hi> are left to shew rather what it was, than what it is: whose Citizens, as the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> did, do repute their strength to consist in their men, and not in their walls. In the City of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi> along by the <hi>Thames</hi> side, are many stately buildings for the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:103995:51"/>
Nobles, and great men of the Land, as <hi>Essex</hi> house, <hi>Arundel</hi> house, <hi>Summerset</hi> house, &amp;c. The <hi>Abby</hi> Church in <hi>Westminster,</hi> was the last time built by King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, of excellent workmanship, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with sundry rows of Marble Pillars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the roof covered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with sheets of Lead: a peece of work that cost fifty years la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in building: It was afterwards much enlarged towards the West end, by the succeeding Abbots: and at the East end King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh built for the burial of himself, and his children, a Chappel of admirable, and stately workmanship: called by <hi>Leland,</hi> the <hi>VVonder of the VVorld:</hi> for a man would think that all the curious, and exquisite work that can bee devised, is there compacted together; wherein is to bee seen his own most stately, and magnificent monument all of massy and solid Copper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVestminster</hi> Hall was built from the ground by King <hi>Richard</hi> the second, and made his own habitation, which continued so till <hi>Henry</hi> the eights time, who removed it to <hi>VVhite-Hall,</hi> which formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to Cardinal <hi>VVoolsey.</hi> The <hi>New Exchange</hi> was built by the Earle of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and so named by King <hi>James.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to return a little again to <hi>London</hi>: There are in it many publick and beautiful buildings, as that famous Senate-house called <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> built by Sir <hi>Thomas Knowls,</hi> Lord Mayor: <hi>Leaden-hall,</hi> a large, and goodly building, erected by <hi>Simon Eire,</hi> to bee a common Granarie, wherein to lay up Corn, to bring down the price thereof in time of a dearth: But especially the <hi>Burse,</hi> which Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> with a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Ceremony, named the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> erected upon Pillars for the use of Merchants, and ornament of the City: It was set up by Sir <hi>Thomas Gresham,</hi> Citizen, and Knight: A most magnificent work it is, whether you respect the model of the building, the resort of Merchants from all Nations thither, or the store of wares there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>

               <p>This <hi>Royal Exchange</hi> was erected in the year, 1566. in this order: The ground whereon it stands, and the houses, were purchased by the Citizens of <hi>London</hi>: It cost them above three thousand five hundred thirty and two pounds: the houses they sold for four hundred seventy and eight pounds, to such persons as should pull them down, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them away: Then was the ground levelled at the charges of the City, and possession thereof was by some Aldermen, given to Sir <hi>Thomas Gresham,</hi> Knight, and Agent for Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> thereupon to build a <hi>Burse</hi> at his own proper charges, and hee on the seventh of <hi>June,</hi> laid the first foundation Brick, being accompanied with some Aldermen, every one laying a peece of gold upon his Brick, which the workmen took for themselves, and forthwith followed their work with such diligence, that in <hi>September, Anno Christi,</hi> 1567. the same was finished, and covered with slate.</p>

               <p>Wee may not passe by that greatest, and most noble work that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was done by one man, and hee a subject, which was the building and endowing of the <hi>Charter-house</hi> by Mr. <hi>Thomas Sutton</hi> for the entertainment of youth; and decayed Gentlemen, who by maims in the wars, or by other casualties were undone: where their provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is so bountious, that it can hardly bee matched in <hi>Europe:</hi> the very house and appurtenances cost him thirteen thousand pound, besides which, hee endowed it with five manners in <hi>Essex,</hi> two in <hi>Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> eight in <hi>VVilt-shire,</hi> together with near four thousand acres of rich pasture ground in that County. Two in <hi>Cambridge-shire,</hi> beside his lands in <hi>Hackney-Marsh,</hi> and <hi>Tottenham</hi> in the County of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> and with all, and singular the VVoods, Reversions, Presentations, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103995:52"/>
Rights of him the said <hi>Thomas Sutton</hi> in any of the aforesaid Mannors; over and above hee gave five thousand pound to make additions to his Hospital, and for some other charitable uses. And to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury of the house to defend their right if need were, one thousand pound, besides some other gifts.</p>
               <p>Wee may in the next place take notice how commodiously <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> is supplied with water, conveyed by pipes under ground from excellent springs, some of them at a remote distance: besides the <hi>New-River</hi> water brought twenty miles from <hi>Chadwel,</hi> and <hi>Amwel,</hi> in <hi>Hartford-shire,</hi> to the North side of the City near <hi>Islington,</hi> where a large Cistern is made to receive it. This work was undertaken by Mr. <hi>Hugh Middleton,</hi> and begun <hi>February</hi> twenty, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1608. and in five years space was fully accomplished: by reason of the inequality of the ground, the Trench in some places descended full thirty foot: In others it was mounted over Vallies in a Trough, born up with wooden Arches, some fixed deep in the ground, others rising in height above three and twenty foot.</p>
               <p>Another convenience of water was devised by <hi>Peter Maurice,</hi> a <hi>Dutchman,</hi> who by means of a wheel brings water out of the <hi>Thames,</hi> into a great part of the City.</p>

It hath Hospitals in every quarter thereof, for the benefit of the poor, and fair Churches. The most beautiful of all which, is St. <hi>Maries</hi> of <hi>Radcliff</hi> without the walls, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which there is a most stately ascent up many stairs: large withal, and finely and curiously wrought, with an arched roof of stone over the head, artificially embowed: a steeple also of an exceeding height, which was founded by one <hi>VVilliam Cannings</hi> an Alderman of the City. Hard by there is another Church called the <hi>Temple,</hi> the Tower whereof when the Bell rings shaketh to, and fro, whereby it hath cloven it self from the rest of the building.

               <p>There are within this City, and suburbs, twenty fair Churches, whereof eighteen are parish Churches: there is no dunghill in all the City, nor a sink that comes from any house into the street, but all is conveyed under ground: they carry all upon sleads, and bring no Carts into the City.

               <p>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> when it was first built was but two &amp; twenty miles in compasse: it was situated upon dainty hills, in a most healthfull air: had a brave River running by it, with the more ease to convey the in-land com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities for her necessity, and delight; it had the Sea at a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent distance, not too neer, whereby shee might be annoyed with For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Navies, nor so remote, but that shee might bee supplyed with outlandish Commodities. The River <hi>Tiber</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> is four hundred foot broad, and so deep that it will carry ships of the greatest burden. Its about sixteen miles distant from the Sea. It was almost round in compasse. The Suburbs in processe of time grew so great, that <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:103995:67"/>
the Emperor built new walls, which were almost fifty miles in compasse, the walls were adorned with seven hundred and forty Turrets: And yet again, the Suburds in a little time grew so great, that one of them was fifteen miles long, and reacht even to the Sea, and in <hi>Augustus</hi> his time, there was numbred in <hi>Rome</hi> above three hundred, and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thousand poor people that received relief from the publick: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the number of Bondmen was very great: few rich men, but they had an hundred and some four hundred a peece: <hi>Seneca</hi> saith in his time that the Inhabitants were so many, that the spatious and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable houses were scarce able to contain them: that a great part of them were Forreigners that came from all parts of the world to live there: So that the number of Inhabitants was reckoned to bee at least four millions. These people were sustained with provisions brought out of all Nations: so that <hi>Rome</hi> seemed to bee the common Mart of the whole World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> to shew the greatnesse of the City; caused all the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to be gathered and put together, which being weighed, amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ten thousand pound weight, and a great plague breaking out at <hi>Rome,</hi> for many dayes together, there dyed ten thousand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
               <p>The houses were generally built very high, that so they might bee the more capacious, insomuch as <hi>Augustus</hi> was fain to make a Decree, that their buildings should not exceed seventy foot in height, conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they marred the delicacy of the air, by their over-much sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow: but this extended only to private mens houses, for the great men were not limited.</p>
               <p>But besides the great height of the houses, they were beautified by the matter whereof they were built, by the Architecture, and by the Symmetry of them, wherein Art and Elegancy strove for priority. And for that end, what exquisite workmen soever <hi>Greece,</hi> or <hi>Asia</hi> brought forth, they were either sent for, or came of their own accord to beautify this Imperiall City, especially in <hi>Augustus's</hi> time, who made his boasts, <hi>Marmoream se relinquere, quam lateritiam accepisset</hi>: that hee should leave <hi>Rome</hi> built of Marble, which hee found built of Bricks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nero</hi> also when hee had burned a great part of it, at his own charges built it up again, beautifying it with excellently composed streets large wayes, and curious porches to all the houses, which three things were a great Ornament to the City: whereupon <hi>Cassiodorus</hi> saith, <hi>Our fore-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers tell us of the seven wonders of the world: The Temple of</hi> Diana <hi>at</hi> Ephesus: <hi>The costly Tomb of King</hi> Mausolus: <hi>The brazen Statue of the Sun in the Isle of</hi> Rhodes, <hi>called the</hi> Colossus: <hi>The Image of</hi> Jupiter Olympicus <hi>made by</hi> Phidias: <hi>The house of</hi> Cyrus <hi>King of the</hi> Medes <hi>and</hi> Persians, <hi>built by</hi> Memnon: <hi>The walls of</hi> Babylon <hi>built by</hi> Semiramis: <hi>And the</hi> Pyramides <hi>of</hi> Egypt. <hi>But now</hi> (saith hee) <hi>the City of</hi> Rome <hi>is the greatest miracle of them all.</hi> There were in it four hundred twenty four Temples erected to their Idol-gods.</p>
               <p>There were two Capitols in <hi>Rome</hi>; The old built by <hi>Numa,</hi> the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:103995:67"/>
new begun by <hi>Tarquinius Priscus,</hi> and <hi>Superbus,</hi> finished by <hi>Horatius Pulvillus</hi> Consul, upon the <hi>Saturnin,</hi> or <hi>Tarpeian,</hi> or <hi>Capitoline</hi> hill. It was eight acres, or eight hundred feet in compasse, almost four square. It was ascended unto by one hundred steps on the South part, which looked towards the market place, and Palace, it would hold eight thousand men. It was covered with Brasse-tiles all guilt with Gold; There were three Chappels in it, to one of which <hi>(viz. Jupiters) Augustus</hi> gave sixteen thousand pound weight of gold, and jewels worth almost as much more, twelve thousand talents were spent in gilding of it. The gates were covered with thick plates of Gold.</p>
               <p>The only foundations of this Capitol cost <hi>Tarquinius</hi> forty thousand pound weight of silver, the pillars of it were cut out of a Quarry of Marble, called <hi>Pentick-marble,</hi> and they were as thick as long. <hi>Plut.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next after the Capitol, the <hi>Pantheon</hi> is worthily noted. It was built by <hi>Agrippa,</hi> son in Law to <hi>Augustus</hi> in the year of the City seven hundred twenty and nine. The Architecture of it was admirable, the beauty, and proportion of all the parts most exquisite: the breadth of it was one hundred forty and four feet, and the height as much: It was wholly covered over with very great tiles of Brass richly guilt. In the reign of <hi>Trajan</hi> it was burnt by lightning, and re-built by <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The Temple of <hi>Peace</hi> was built by <hi>Vespasian,</hi> three hundred foot long, and two hundred broad: It was the most beautifull of all the Temples in the City, and enriched with gifts of inestimable value: It was adorned with Statues, and pictures of most exquisite workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: yea and all the rarities were collected into this Temple, for the sight whereof men formerly used to travell through the whole world. And here also hee placed those vessels which formerly belonged to the Temple of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and were brought from thence by <hi>Titus</hi> at the sacking of it. It was burnt down in the time of <hi>Commodus,</hi> either with fire from heaven, or arising out of the earth after a little Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake.</p>
               <p>There were an infinite number of Baths both publike, and private in <hi>Rome.</hi> Some of which baths, were all paved with plates of silver and set with rows of Pillars for ornament. <hi>Antoninus's</hi> bath had sixteen hundred seats of polished Marble in it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Appian</hi> Causey was built by <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> Censor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It reached from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Capua,</hi> the bounds of the Empire that way, at that time; which was afterwards lengthened to <hi>Brundusium</hi> by <hi>Julius,</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus Caesar,</hi> in all three hundred and fifty miles long, and so broad, that two coaches might easily pass by one another, being about twenty and five foot broad. It was made of hard flinty stones, hewen and laid so close together (yet without any morter or claspes of Iron) that it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all of onestone; the stones were three, four, and five feet square: nine hundred years after it was made, the stones were not one whit dis-joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or broken, ever and anon on the sides were stones whereon persons might sit, or lay their burdens, or get on horseback, and at every
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:103995:68"/>
miles end, high stones (or pillars) were raised, whereon were engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the number of the miles. Likewise there were many Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on both sides with witty inscriptions, or pretty inventions on them, yeelding both matter of mirth, and seriousness to the travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</p>
               <p>There were fourteen (saith <hi>Pliny</hi>) twenty (saith <hi>P. Victor) Aquae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi>; the chiefest of which was the <hi>Claudian,</hi> began by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligula,</hi> and finished by <hi>Claudius</hi>; so big as a man might ride on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back in it; brought forty miles to the City in a level, through the Mountains, and over the Vallies; as high as the highest hill in the City: seven millions and a half were spent in making it. There were besides in the City one thousand three hundred fifty two Lakes, or great receptacles of water for common use.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cloacae,</hi> or common sewers, were made by <hi>Tarquinius Priscus</hi>; they were so wide, that a Cart loaden with Hay might passe along them, <hi>viz.</hi> sixteen foot wide, and as many high. There were seven chief armes from the seven hills (besides several smaller from other parts) which ran into the main Channel. Notwithstanding all the weight of building upon them, and several earthquakes, they remained firm almost eight hundred years. And at one time when they were out of repair, there were a thousand talents spent in repairing of them.</p>
               <p>There was an infinite number of Statues, or Images in every part of the City, costly for their matter, and curious for their work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship: some Authors say, that there were near as many of them, as there were living people in the City; some of them were of polished Marble; infinite of brass, some of Ivory, some of Silver, and some of Gold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Domitian</hi> the Emperour commanded that no statues should bee made for him in the <hi>Capitol,</hi> but such as were all of silver, or all gold, solid, and not hollow, each of them weighing at least an hundred pound weight: <hi>Commodus</hi> the Emperor had a statue made for him of gold that weighed a thousand pound weight: Together with a Bull and a Cow of the same mettal, as if hee had been the founder of the City. Hee had also in the Market-place a Pillar erected, and his Statue made upon it, of a thousand five hundred pounds weight of silver. Their statues of brass were most of them guilt, and so were many of their statues of silver. Some of them were of a <hi>Colossaean</hi> bigness, others mounted on horse-back, and in several postures, and habits: For the preserving of all which from hurt, there was one who was called <hi>Comes,</hi> or an Earl, whose office it was, continually to walk up and down in the night, attended with many souldiers, that none might wrong them, and besides it was death for any man to do it. <hi>Lipsius de Mag.

               <p>First, the people having set up sundry scaffolds as well in the lists, and field called <hi>Circos,</hi> where the games, and races of horses, and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets used to bee, as also about the Market-place, and in all the streets through which the Triumph should pass, they all presented themselves in their best gowns, to see the magnificence, and state thereof. All the Temples of the Gods were set wide open, hanged full of Garlands of flowers, and all perfumed within. Through all the quarters of the City were set many Sergeants, and other officers, with tipstaves to order the stragling people, and to keep them from pestring the streets, or hindring the triumph which lasted three dayes.</p>
               <p>The first day was scant sufficient to see the passing by of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Tables, Pictures, and Statues of a wonderful bignesse, all wonne, and gotten of their enemies, and now drawn upon two hundred and fifty Charrets.</p>
               <p>The second day there were carried upon a great number of Carts all the fairest, and richest Armor of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> as well of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as of Iron, and Steele, all glistering bright, being newly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bished, and artificially laid in order: Fair Burganets upon Targets, Habergions, and Corslets upon greaves: Round Targets of the <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> and Javelins of the <hi>Thracians,</hi> and arrows amongst the armed pikes: All bound so trimly one to another, that one hitting against another as they were drawn, made such a sound, and noise as was fearful to hear. After these Carts there followed three thousand men, which carried the ready mony in seven hundred and fifty Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels which weighed about three Talents a peece, each of them car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by four men. Others carried great bowles, cups and goblets of silver, and other pots to drink in, beautiful to behold, as well for their bignesse, as for the great, and singular embossed work about them.</p>
               <p>The third day early in the morning the Trumpets sounded the brave alarum they give at an assault, after whom followed one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty goodly fat Oxen, with their horns guilt, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands of flowers, and nosegaies about their heads, and by them went many young men with aprons of needle-work about their middles, who led them to the Sacrifice, and with them young boyes that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

goodly Basons of gold and silver to receive, and sprinkle the blood of the Sacrifices about. After these followed all those that carryed all coins of gold, and Basons, and Vessels, each of them weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three Talents. Then was carryed the great holy cup which <hi>Aemy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> had caused to bee made of massy gold, set full of precious stones, weighing ten Talents for an offering to the gods. Next to them went they which carryed Plate, made, and wrought after Antick fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions, and the admirable cups of the ancient Kings of <hi>Macedon</hi>: as the cup called <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and another <hi>Seleucus</hi>: and to bee brief, all the whole cup-broad of plate of gold, and silver of King <hi>Perseus:</hi> and next them came the Kings Charriot with his Armour, and his royal Crown upon the same. A little after followed the Kings Children, whom they led prisoners with the train of their School Masters, and other Officers, and their servants weeping, and lamenting, who held up their hands to the people that looked upon them, thereby teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the young Children to do the like, and to ask mercy, and grace at the peoples hands. There were three pretty little Children, two sons, and a Daughter amongst them, who by reason of their tender years lacked understanding, which made them (poor souls) insensible of their present misery, and that moved the people so much the more to pitty them, seeing the poor little infants that knew not the change of their hard hap: so that through compassion to them, they had almost let the Father pass without looking upon him: yea many of the peoples hearts did so melt for pitty, that the tears ran down their cheeks till they were past, and gone a good way out of sight.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Perseus</hi> the Father followed after his Children, and their train: Hee was cloathed in a black gown, with a pair of slippers on his feet, after his Country manner: Hee shewed by his countenance, his troubled mind, being opprest with sorrow for his most miserable estate, and condition: Hee was followed with his kinsfolk, his famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar friends, his officers, and houshold servants, their faces being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured with blubbering, shewing to the world by their lamentable tears, and sorrowful eyes cast upon their unfortunate Master, how much they sorrowed, and bewailed his most hard and woful estate, whilest they made little account of their own misery.</p>
               <p>After all these, there followed four hundred Princely Crowns of gold, which the Cities, and Towns of <hi>Greece</hi> had purposely sent by their Ambassadors unto <hi>Aemylius,</hi> to honour his victory: And last of all came <hi>Aemylius</hi> himself in his Triumphant Chariot, which was passing sumptuously set forth, and adorned: This was a gallant sight to behold, and yet the person himself was worth looking on without all that great pomp, and magnificence: for hee was cloathed in a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple gown, curiously branched with gold, carrying in his right hand a bough of Lawrel, as all his Army did the like, the which being divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by bands and companies: followed the Triumphant Chariot of their Captain, some of the souldiers singing songs of victory, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the usual manner of the <hi>Romans</hi> in the like cases, mingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:103995:69"/>
them with merry, and pleasant toyes, as glorying, and rejoycing in their General: others of them sang songs of Triumph in the honour, and praise of <hi>Aemylius</hi> his noble conquests, and victorys: so that hee was openly praised, blessed and honoured of all, and neither hated, nor envied of any that were good, and honest. <hi>Plut. in vita ejus.</hi>

               <p>In the first place there were Tables carryed, whereon were written the names and titles of all the people, and Nations which hee had conquered, and for which hee triumphed; as the Kingdomes of <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Armenia, Cappadocia, Paphlagonia, Media, Colchis, Iberia, Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, Syria, Cilicia,</hi> and <hi>Mesopotamia</hi>: as also the people that dwell about <hi>Phaenicia, Palaestine, Judaea,</hi> and <hi>Arabia:</hi> and all the Pirates which hee had overcome both by Sea, and Land, in all parts of the world: In all these Countries, hee had taken a thousand Castles, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most nine hundred Cities, and walled Towns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Of Pirates ships eight hundred: Hee had replenished again with people, nine and thirty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate Towns that were left without Inhabitants: In these Tables was further declared, that before these conquests the revenues of the Common-wealth of <hi>Rome</hi> were but five thousand Myriads <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> but now <hi>Pompey</hi> had made them eight thousand and five hundred Myriads <hi>per annum</hi>: and that hee had brought now for the Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in ready gold and silver, Plate and Jewels, the value of twenty thousand Talents, besides that which hee had distributed amongst his souldiers, of which hee that had least for his share, had one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand five hundred Drachma's: The prisoners that were led in this Triumph, besides the Captains of the Pirates, were, the son of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes,</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> with his wife and daughter: The wife of King <hi>Tygranes</hi> himself, called <hi>Zosime: Aristobulus,</hi> King of <hi>Judaea: Mithridates</hi> sister, with her five sons, and some Ladies of <hi>Scythia</hi>: The hostages also of the <hi>Iberians,</hi> and <hi>Albanians,</hi> and of the Kings of the <hi>Commagenians</hi>: beside many other things too large to recite: But that which made his honour the greatest, and whereunto never any of the <hi>Roman</hi> Consuls attained, was, that in his three Triumphs, hee triumphed over the three parts of the world: In his first over <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick,</hi> in his second over <hi>Europe,</hi> and now in this third over <hi>Asia,</hi> which was almost all the then known world; and all this before hee was forty years old. <hi>Plut.

               <head>A Description of the City of <hi>Venice,</hi> with her Rarities, which was begun to bee built <hi>Anno Christi 421.</hi> upon the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> and upon seventy and two Islands.</head>
               <p>This Wonder of Cities, is seated in the bosome, or betwixt the Armes of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea: It is built upon four thousand Islands, and is (as it were) chained together by four thousand Bridges. The occasion which made these watry Isles a mansion for men, was when that Northern Deluge of <hi>Goths, Vandals, Huns,</hi> and <hi>Longobards</hi> did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflow all <hi>Italy,</hi> the people of all sorts fled to these lakes, to avoid the land torrent that was like to swallow them up; and finding the Air to bee gentle, and fit for habitation, and propagation, they pitched their Tents upon these Isles, and associated them by conjoyning Bridges.</p>
               <p>There are seventy two Isles that support <hi>Venice:</hi> and the nearest part of the Continent is five miles distant: There are banks, and dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches cast up to preserve her from the impetuousnesse of the waves of the Sea, extending in length above six miles. Shee is above eight miles in circuit. Through the banks in seven places, there are passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges broken for boats, but not for bigger vessels. Besides there be above twenty thousand Gondolaes, or Boats, which ply up and down perpetually, in each of which are two rowers at least, so that upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, shee can suddenly make an Army of above fifty thousand Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doliers. Shee hath for her Motto, <hi>Nec fluctu, nec flatu movetur.</hi> Nor winds, nor waves can stir her.</p>
               <p>Her Fabriques, publick and private are extraordinary specious, and sumptuous, and her streets so neat, and evenly paved, that in the depth of winter a man may walk up, and down in a pair of Sattin Pan-tables, and Crimson Silk stockings, and not bee dirtied. There are above two hundred Palaces fit to receive any Prince with his ordinary retinue: Her situation is so rare, every street almost having an arm of the Sea running thorow it; and her structures so magnificent, and neat, that shee ravisheth therewith all strangers that come to visit her.</p>
               <p>She hath in her one hundred and fifty Churches, and Monasteries: but especially three things worthy of sight, <hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Mark's</hi> Church and Steeple, the <hi>Treasury,</hi> and the <hi>Arsenal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Mark's</hi> Church is built throughout with rare <hi>Mosaique</hi> work, and yet the furniture of the Church surpasseth the Fabrique in richnesse; Her walls are inlaid in many places with precious stones of diverse co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and in such a manner, that they seem rather to be the work of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than of Art.</p>
               <p>It is built in the form of a Crosse, whose corners are highly vaulted, and covered with bright Lead, as all the rest of the Church is. The whole Bulk is supported with most curious Arches joyned together by marvellous Art. The inside from the middle to the highest part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of glistereth with gold, and the concavity of the vaults is enriched
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:103995:70"/>
with divers curious, and antick pictures. That which is from the gilding down to the pavement, is excellently joyned together with goodly Tables of Marble, by whose pleasant veins in form of rays, the eyes of the beholders are rather fed than satisfied. The seats below are of an extraordinary red stone, like to <hi>Porphyry,</hi> the Pavement is all of Marble engraven with diverse figures wholly different, and of various colours: There are sundry Columnes and Tables of <hi>Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Spartan,</hi> and <hi>Numidian</hi> work, that environ the seats on both sides the Quire. The entrance into the Church on both sides, is in a manner of the same trimming: while gilded Arches are sustained without, by more than three hundred exquisite Pillars, the space between those Pillars being filled with choyce Tables of Marble. On the height of this entrance, are four great brazen horses all gilded over, in a posture as if running, and neighing. All this bears up the highest top of the Church divided into six Steeples, every of which is like a <hi>Pyramid,</hi> and hath on the sharpest point thereof, a white Marble Statue of a naked man standing upright. Divers other representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons delightfull to the eye, and wrought with exceeding skill, do beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the spaces between the Steeples, and all that which is vaulted underneath is covered with Gold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In sum, there is no place in the whole Church, either within, or without, but it's either adorned with Marble, Gold, or precious stones; so that the two Columnes of Alabaster, and the <hi>Chalcedony</hi> stones which are in the middest of the pavement, are accounted the least curiosities.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arsenal</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> is one of the greatest Magazines of Armes in all the World; It's three miles in compasse, wherein there are above three hundred Artificers, perpetually at work, who make, and repair all things that belong thereto. This <hi>Arsenal</hi> hath armes to furnish two hundred thousand men, and hath constantly belonging to it two hundred Gallies in Dock, or abroad in course, besides Galliasses, and Galleons, with all provisions necessary for them. Amongst the Armors, are one thousand coats of plate; garnished with gold, and covered with velvet, so that they are fit for any Prince in Christendome.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Treasury</hi> of St. <hi>Mark</hi> is cried up through the World: They say there is enough in it to pay six Kings Ransomes. There are Jewels of all sorts, and sizes, <hi>Diamonds, Rubies, Saphires, Emerauds,</hi> Cups of <hi>Agat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is an huge Gold chain that reacheth from Pillar to Pillar: Diverse Chests of Gold, and amongst others, one great Iron Chest with this inscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>When this Chest shall open, the whole earth shall tremble.</hi> There are two large <hi>Unicorn's horns.</hi> A great Bottle made of a <hi>Chalcedonian</hi> stone transparent, and clear, which will hold above a quart. There is a <hi>Garnet</hi> of a vast size, formed into the shape of a Kettle which will hold

neer a Gallon. There are many Crosses, and Crucifixes of massie Gold beset with Jewells of all sorts: There are the Crowns of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Candy,</hi> as also that of the Dukes of <hi>Venice</hi> all inlaid with choyce rich <hi>Diamonds,</hi> great <hi>Rubies, Emerauds, Saphires,</hi> and other stones that would beget astonishment in the beholders. In that of the Dukes, there is one great <hi>Ruby</hi> worth an hundred thousand Crowns. There are Cups of sundry formes cut out of rich stones, with dishes of sundry kinds. There are divers presses full of plate, huge, and mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy, with Statues of Silver, and large Chalices of gold, and variety of other rich things, the worth whereof no eye is able to judge. There are moreover twelve Crowns of massie Gold, which were taken at the sacking of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> when the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Venetians</hi> divided the spoyles. <hi>Pacheco</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadour, comming to see this Treasury, fell a groping whether it had any bottom, and being asked why? answered; <hi>In this amongst other things, my great Mast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers's Treasure, differs from yours, in that his hath no bottom, as I finde yours to have.</hi> Alluding to the Mines in <hi>Mexico,</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofi.</hi>

                  <hi>Florence</hi> is the Capitol City of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> situated at the bottom of very high hills, and environed on all sides with the same, except on the West side, before which lies a plain Country. This City is divided into two by the River <hi>Arno,</hi> over which are built four Bridges of stone; upon one of the two chief is the Goldsmiths street: upon the other, which is a very stately structure, stand the four quarters of the year in Marble: Opposite unto which, stands a vast Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne with a Statue of Justice in <hi>Porphyrie</hi> at the top: Hard by is the Palace of <hi>Strossie,</hi> admirable for the immensity of its Fabrick; on the left hand whereof is the Merchants Vault supported with many fair Pillars, and before it a brazen Boar jetting forth water: Before that is the great place, in the middest whereof is the great Duke <hi>Cosmus</hi> on horseback in brass, near unto which is a Fountain, the like to which <hi>Italy</hi> affords not. Round about the Laver is the Family of <hi>Neptune</hi> in brasse, with his <hi>Colosse</hi> of Marble in the middest, born up by four horses. In this same <hi>Piazza</hi> is a Porch arched and adorned with some Statues, amongst which that of <hi>Judith</hi> in brass, with the rape of the Sabines, three persons in several postures cut all out of one stone. Just against it is the <hi>Palazzo Vechio,</hi> at the entrance whereof stand two <hi>Colossi,</hi> the one of <hi>David,</hi> the other of <hi>Hercules</hi> tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on <hi>Caous,</hi> excellent pieces. Within is a Court set about with pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of <hi>Corinthian</hi> work. Above is a very spacious Hall with divers
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:103995:72"/>
Statues. Near to it is the richest of Treasures, the great Dukes Gallery, in the uppermost part whereof are contained as many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as things: some to bee admired for the preciousness, and Art; others for their rarity, and antiquity: On each side of the Gallery stand above fourescore Statues: One, an Idoll brought from the Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> in <hi>Delphos:</hi> Another of <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> holding up his gown under his Arm: Then two curious triumphant Pillars: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Statues hang rare pictures, the most famous Scholars on the one side, and Souldiers on the other.</p>
               <p>At the right hand of this Gallery are several <hi>Stanza's</hi> full of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osities, wherewith the spectators are astonished, both in regard of the richnesse, and rarity thereof. In the first Room is an Altar totally compacted of Jewels, and precious stones: The value inestimable. In the next is a Table with Flowers, and Birds in their natural colours of precious stones, with a Cabinet worth two hundred thousand Crowns, covered with <hi>Agates, Emerauds, Amethists,</hi> &amp;c. Within it is the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of Christs Passion, with the twelve Apostles all in Amber. In the third is a Cabinet with <hi>Calcedonie</hi> Pillars, filled with ancient Medals of gold. Round about this Room are an infinite number of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and Artificial curiosities: As the Emperours head cut on a <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoise</hi> bigger than a Walnut, with thousands more. Next is the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; wherein are the habits, and diverse sorts of Arms of several ages, and people. There is likewise a Loadstone that bears up four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score pounds weight of Iron. In the last Cabinet are curious turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed works of Ivory, A Pillar of Oriental Alabaster, &amp;c. In another Room are twelve great Cupboards of silver Plate of all sorts, and another of all pure massie gold: A Saddle all embroydered with Pearls, and Diamonds; besides many other things of great worth.</p>
               <p>From hence is a private passage to the Dukes Court on the other side of the River: The front of which edifice is very Majestick, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Basis of <hi>Dorick</hi> work, in the middest of <hi>Ionick,</hi> and the uppermost story of <hi>Corinthian.</hi> In the Court is a <hi>Grotto</hi> with Statues, and a Fountain over it; and a Loadstone of a most prodigious great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>The Gardens belonging to it, for their largenesse have the face of a Forrest, for their variety, of a Paradise. Here are Cypresse Groves, their Walks with Statues: Here a Sea of Fountains; these Swans, Ostriches, and other delighting Creatures.</p>
               <p>The Cathedral Church is of a vast bulk, and exquisite workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, made of Red, White, and black Marble. The <hi>Cupola</hi> is so high, that the brass Globe at the top will hold sixteen persons: No lesse excellent is the Steeple, composed of the same stone and materials with the Church, but with more Art, and Ornaments.</p>
               <p>The Chappel of St. <hi>Laurence</hi> seems more than terrestrial: Its wholly overlaid with fine polished stones, neither is there any colour upon Earth, but it's there in stones naturally. Near to this is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Library, filled with great variety of Manuscripts. In brief, the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103995:73"/>
houses of <hi>Florence</hi> are generally built high, the streets are paved with great stones, even and large, and adorned with many excellent Fountains, and other publick Ornaments.</p>

Close by him on another Throne sate the Prince, in an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Garment like his Fathers, but not so rich, with an high black Fox cap on his head, worth there five hundred pound, having a golden staffe in his hand. On the Emperours right hand stood two gallant Noble men in cloath of silver, high black Fox Caps, with great long gold chains hanging to their feet, with Poleaxes of gold on their shoulders; and on the left hand of the Prince stood two other such, but their Poleaxes were of silver: round about on benches sate the Council, and Nobility in golden and <hi>Persian</hi> Coats, and high black Fox Caps to the number of two hundred, the ground being covered with cloath of <hi>Arras.</hi> After dinner (saith hee again) wee were led to have audience through many Chambers to a very fair and rich room, where was infinite store of massie plate of all sorts, where wee again viewed the Emperour, and Prince seated under two Chairs of state, each having a scul of Pearl upon their heads.

The whole Country almost is either Lakes or Mountains: those on the outside are barren craggie Rocks: but in the inland they are well furnished with woods, the Lakes being in the Vallies: their diet is very mean; bread they have none, but feed only upon Fish, and Fowle: they are subjects, part to <hi>Russia,</hi> part to <hi>Sweden,</hi> and the other part to <hi>Denmark,</hi> which all exact tribute of them: but the Emperor of <hi>Russia</hi> the most. They are wholly unlearned, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving so much as the use of the Alphabet amongst them: They pass all Nations in witch-craft, and sorcery: Their weapons are long-Bows, and hand-guns wherein they are very nimble, and excellent marks-men through their continual practise in shooting at wilde fowle: For our <hi>English</hi> cloath they give Fish, Oil, and Furs, whereof they have store: when their fishing is done, they draw their boats to shore, turning the keel upwards, and so let them lye till the next spring-tyde: They travel upon sleds drawn by <hi>Olen-Deer,</hi> which they use to turn a grazing all the Summer time in an Island called <hi>Kilden,</hi> and towards Winter, when the Snow begins to fall, they fetch them home for their use.</p>

               <p>These <hi>Samoeds,</hi> by their frequent travel, know the wayes, though the weather bee thick, and foggy, as also where store of white Moss grows: at which places, if it bee night they pitch their Tents made of Deer, or Elks-skins, which work is done by the women; and in the mean time the men unyoak the Deer, and turn them loose to dig through the Snow, though it bee very deep, to seek for their food and sustenance. <hi>Pur.

               <p>When a rich <hi>Samoed</hi> dies, because hee should not travel on foot, his friends will kill three Deer to carry him into the new World, they will also strangle a slave to attend on him.

               <p>
                  <hi>Constantinople,</hi> was built by <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great; It stands on a cape of land, near the entrance of the <hi>Bosphorus:</hi> Its in form triangular: On the East side washed with the Sea; on the North with the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and the West side joynes to the Continent. Its walled with brick, and stone intermixed orderly, having twenty four Gates, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterns: Its about thirteen miles in Circumference. The world hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affords a more delicate object, if beheld from the Sea, or adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Mountains. The lofty, and beautiful Cypresse-trees are so inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with the buildings, that it seems to present a City in a wood to the pleased beholders. Its built on seven hills, whose aspiring heads are crowned with magnificent <hi>Mosques,</hi> or Churches, all of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:103995:85"/>
white Marble, round in form; and coupled above; being finished on the top with guilded spires, that reflect the Sun-beams with a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous splendor: some having two; some four, and some six adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Turrets, exceeding high, and slender: Tarrast aloft on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, like the main top of a ship, in several places equally distant, whence their Priests with elated voices (for they use no bells) call the people together to their Mahometan service.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Constantine</hi> first built this City, hee enclosed it with a wall, that for length, fairness, and thickness, was one of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mousest in the world, every stone being cemented together with brass couplets, that the whole wall seemed to bee but one stone: Hee erected also many high Towers, built many sumptuous Temples, and adorned it with infinit more magnificent buildings, both publick, and private: commanding also by publick Edict all Princes of the Empire, that each of them should build a Palace or some other sumptuous, and splendid Monument there: Hee also brought from <hi>Rome</hi> divers memorable Antiquities, as the <hi>Palladium</hi> of <hi>Troy</hi>: the high Pillar of <hi>Porsido,</hi> which hee caused to bee erected in a fit place, by which hee set <hi>Apollo's</hi> brazen Image of an unmeasurable bigness, having his own name ingraven thereon: Amongst other glorious buildings was the proud Palace of the publick Library, wherein were one hundred and twenty thousand choice written Books: in the midst whereof were the guts of a Dragon, above one hundred and twenty foot long, on which <hi>Homers Iliads</hi> were written in letters of gold: In diverse other parts of the City were very rare things, as the Nymphs Grove: the Market-place of mettal: the famous I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of <hi>Juno, Minerva, Venus, &amp;c.</hi> with infinite other varieties: so that strangers which saw it, being full of admiration were astonished at the beauty of it, judging it a dwelling meet for the Gods, rather than an habitation for earthly Emperours.</p>
               <p>But now Time, with her Iron teeth, and the many changes which have happened, have quite altered the face of <hi>Constantinople</hi>: So that now upon the Hill, whereon the Imperial Palace once stood, there are kept Elephants, Panthers, and other wild Beasts in the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of it. On the second Hill whereon stood the Palace of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches, in which were buried in chests of fine Marble, most of the Christian Emperors, a Mosque is now erected. Upon the third Hill is the Sepulchre of the Great <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that won the City, of a marvellous greatness, and magnificence, surrounded with one hundred houses covered with Lead, made to receive strangers of any Nation, where themselves, servants, and horses, may remain three dayes on free cost: Sultan <hi>Mahomet</hi> leaving two hundred thousand Ducats reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue <hi>per annum,</hi> to maintain the same. The fourth Hill hath on it the Church, and Sepulchre of Sultan <hi>Selim</hi> in the same form, and order as the other. The fifth hath the Church and Sepulchre of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> with a great and spacious <hi>Piazza</hi> about it. The sixth hath the Church and Sepulchre of <hi>Solyman</hi> the <hi>Magnificent,</hi> which in greatness, workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, Marble Pillars, and riches more than Kingly, passeth all the

               <p>The Temple of <hi>Sancta Sophia</hi> standing upon one of these hills, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not only all the rest, but all the most stately fabricks in the world: the principal part thereof riseth in an Ovall, surrounded with pillars admirable for their matter, proportion, and workmanship: Over those are others, through which ample Galleries curiously paved, and arched above, have their prospect into the Temple: the roof is compact, and adorned with Mosaick painting; which is composed of little square peices of Marble, gilded, and coloured according to the place they are to assume in the Figure or ground, which set together, as if im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bossed, present an unexpressible statelinesse, and are of marvellous durance. The sides, and floor of the whole Church are laid with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Marble: it is vaulted underneath, containing large Cisternes which are replenished with water from an <hi>Aquaeduct</hi>: within on the left hand is a Pillar covered with Copper, which ever sweats: the doors are curiously cut through, and plated. It was from East to West two hundred and sixty foot long, and in height one hundred and fourscore; and hath contained at once, six and thirty thousand <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the middest of it there are pillars of gold and silver, huge Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesticks, Lanthornes, Lamps, and other Ornaments of gold and sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, whereof the worth is inestimable. It had in it one hundred gates, and was above a mile in compass.</p>

               <head>The <hi>Turks</hi> Seraglio Described.</head>
               <p>In the extreamest North-east angle of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> standeth the great <hi>Turks Seraglio</hi> or Palace, compassed with a lofty wall three miles in compasse, comprehending goodly Groves of Cypresse-trees, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed with plaines, delicate Gardens, Artificial Fountains, vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Fruit-trees, and what not rare? Luxury being the Steward, and the Treasury inexhaustible. The proud Palace of the Tyrant o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to the South, having a lofty Gate-house, engraven with <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi> Characters, set forth with Gold, and Azure, all of white Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: This gate leadeth into a stately Court three hundred yards long, and about one hundred and fifty wide; at the farther end whereof is another gate hung with shields, and Cymiters; this leads into a second Court full of tall Cypresse-trees, being not much lesse than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. It is Cloistered round about, covered with lead, handsome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paved, and supported with Columns of Marble, which have Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piters, and Bases of Copper. On the left hand is the <hi>Divano</hi> kept, where the <hi>Bassa's</hi> of the Court do administer Justice: Beyond this Court on the right hand is a street of Kitchins, and on the left stalles large enough for five hundred horses. Out of the second Court is an
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:103995:86"/>
entrance into the third, surrounded with the Royal buildings, large, curious, and costly. Without on the North side stands the <hi>Sultan's</hi> Cabinet, in form of a sumptuous summer-house, where hee of ten o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laceth himself with variety of Objects, and from whence taking barge hee passeth to the delightfull places of the adjoyning <hi>Asia.</hi> In the <hi>Seraglio</hi> also, are many stately rooms appropriated to the season of the year, which are called <hi>Rooms of fair prospect,</hi> into which the Sultan goeth sometimes alone, but more usually with his Concubines for his recreation. Within a fine little Court adorned with very many delicate Fountains is the Chamber wherein hee gives audience to Ambassadors, &amp;c. one part whereof is spread with very sumptuous Carpets of gold, and Crimson velvet, embroydered with very costly Pearls, upon which the grand Signeur sitteth: the walls of the room are covered with fine white stones, having divers sorts of leaves, and artificial Flowers cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously wrought upon them, which make a glorious shew. A little Room adjoyns to it, the whole inside whereof is covered with silver plate, hatched with gold, the floor being spread with rich <hi>Persian</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets of silk, and gold.</p>
               <p>There are belonging to the <hi>Sultan's</hi> lodgings very fair gardens, of all sorts of flowers, and Fruits, that can bee found in those parts; with many very pleasant walks, enclosed with high Cypresse-trees on both sides, and fountains in such abundance, that almost in every walk there are some of them.</p>
               <p>Besides the former rooms (which are very many) for the <hi>Sultan's</hi> own use, there are also the womens lodgings, wherein the Queen, the <hi>Sultanaes,</hi> and all the Kings women do dwell, and they have in them bed-chambers, dining rooms, with-drawing rooms, and all other kinds of rooms necessary for women.</p>
               <p>In another place there are divers Rooms, and lodgings for all the principal, and inferiour Officers so well furnished, that nothing is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that is fit, and necessary. Amongst which are two large buildings, one his Wardrob, the other his Treasury, with very thick walls, Iron windows, and Iron doors.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Seraglio</hi> are Rooms for Prayer, Bagnoes, Schools, Butteries, Kitchins, Stillatories, Swimming places, places to run horses in, wrestling places, butts to shoot at, and all the commodities that may adorn a Prince's Court.</p>
               <p>There is also an Hospital for such as fall sick in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> in which there are all things necessary for diseased persons: And another large place wherein is kept Timber, Carts, &amp;c. to have them neer hand for the use, and service of the <hi>Seraglio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Over the Stables there is a row of rooms, wherein is kept all the furniture for the horses, which is of an extraordinary value; for the Bridles, Petorals, and Cruppers, are set so thick with jewels of divers sorts, that they cause admiration in the beholders, and exceed Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. The <hi>Grand Signior's</hi> Bed-chamber hath the walls covered with stones of the finest China mettal, spotted with flowers of divers colours, which make a very dainty shew: The <hi>Antiportaes</hi> were of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:103995:87"/>
cloath of gold of <hi>Bursia,</hi> and their borders of Crimson Velvet, embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with gold, and Pearls: The posts of his Bedstead were of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, hollow, and instead of knobs on the tops, there were Lyons of Crystall; the Canopy over it was of cloth of gold, and so were the Bolsters, and Matteresses: the floor was covered with very costly <hi>Persian</hi> Carpets of silk, and gold, and the Pallats to sit on, and Cushi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were of very rich cloth of gold.</p>
               <p>In the hall adjoyning is a very great Lanthorn round, and the bars of silver, and gilt, set very thick with Rubies, Emeralds, and Turkes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; the panes were of very fine Crystal, which made a very resplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent shew. There was also a Bason, and Ewre, to wash in, of massie gold, set with Rubies, and Turkesses.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Constantinople</hi> is a <hi>Piazza,</hi> in which is raised upon four Dice of fine Mettal, a very fair Pyramid of mingled stone all of one peice, fifty Cubits high, carved with <hi>Heroical</hi> letters, resembling the <hi>Agulia</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> in whose top were the enclosed ashes of <hi>Julius Caesar:</hi> In the same <hi>Piazzo</hi> also is a great Pillar of Brasse, made with marvellous Art, in form of three serpents wreathed together with their mouths up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>There are in <hi>Constantinople</hi> eighteen thousand Mosques, great and small: In the chief place of it are two Burses, built four square, high, and round at top, each having four gates opening upon four streets, round about garnished with shops, stuffed with all sorts of rich, and cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wares of inestimable value, as precious stones, Pearls, Sables, and other rich Furs of all sorts; Silk, and cloath of gold: Bows, Arrows, Bucklers, and Swords: Here also they fell Christian Slaves of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as wee sell horses, the buyers looking them in the eyes, mouth, and all other parts, which is done every forenoon, except Fridayes, which is their Sabbath. The <hi>Bassa's</hi> also in sundry places have built fair houses, encompassed with high walls, which outwardly have no beauty: but inwardly full of all riches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and pleasure, the world can afford: For they use to say, that they build not to please passers by, but for their own Commodity.</p>

               <head>The <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire Described.</head>
               <p>The <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> who hath his seat in the stately, and Imperiall City of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> hath under his command, the chiefest, and most fruitful parts of the three first known parts of the world. In <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> he hath all the sea coasts, from the confines of <hi>Epidaurus</hi> (the utmost bound of his Empire in <hi>Europe</hi> Westward) unto the mouth of the River <hi>Tanais,</hi> now called <hi>Don,</hi> with whatsoever lyes from <hi>Buda</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> to the Imperial City of <hi>Constantinople:</hi> in which space is comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the greater part of <hi>Hungary,</hi> all <hi>Bosna, Servia, Bulgaria,</hi> with a great part of <hi>Dalmatia, Epirus, Macedonia, Grecia, Peloponesus, Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> with the rich Islands contained therein. In <hi>Affrica</hi> he possesseth from the river <hi>Mulvia</hi> (the bounder of the kingdom of <hi>Fesse,</hi> to the <hi>Arabian Gulph,</hi> or <hi>Red-sea</hi> Eastward, except some sea-towns
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:103995:87"/>
held by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and from <hi>Alexandria</hi> Northward, unto the City of <hi>Asna</hi> Southward: In which space are contained the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Kingdomes of <hi>Tremizen, Algiers, Tunes,</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other great Cities, and Provinces. In <hi>Asia</hi> all is his from the <hi>Hellespont</hi> Westward, unto the great City of <hi>Tauris</hi> Eastward: and from <hi>Derbent</hi> neer unto the <hi>Caspian</hi> sea Northward, unto <hi>Aden</hi> upon the <hi>Arabian Gulph</hi> Southward.</p>
               <p>The greatnesse of his Empire may bee the better conceived by the greatnesse of some of the parts of it: the <hi>Meer of Meotis</hi> (which is all at his command) being in compasse one thousand miles: and the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xine,</hi> or <hi>Black-sea,</hi> which is in circuit two thousand seven hundred miles, and the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> coast which is subject to him, contains in compasse about eight thousand miles. The like distance is from <hi>Derbent</hi> to <hi>Aden</hi>: And from <hi>Balsara</hi> upon the <hi>Persian Gulph,</hi> unto <hi>Tremisen</hi> in <hi>Barbary,</hi> are neer four thousand miles. Hee hath also in the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean</hi> sea, the noble Isles of <hi>Cyprus, Euboea, Rhodes, Samos, Chios, Lesbos,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In this so large, and spatious an Empire, are contained many great Countries, sometimes famous Kingdomes, abounding with all sorts of temporal blessings, and natures store; For what Kingdome is more fruitful than <hi>Egypt, Syria,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Asia?</hi> what Countrey more abounding with all good things, than was sometimes <hi>Hungary, Grecia,</hi> and <hi>Thracia?</hi> In these Countries hee hath also many rich and famous Cities, but especially four, which bee of greatest wealth, and trade, <hi>viz. Constantinople, Grand-Caire, Aleppo,</hi> and <hi>Tauris. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> for multitude of Inhabitants, exceeds all the Cities in <hi>Europe,</hi> wherein are reckoned to bee above seven hundred thousand men. <hi>Aleppo</hi> is the greatest City of <hi>Syria,</hi> and the Centre whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the merchandize of <hi>Asia</hi> is brought. <hi>Tauris,</hi> of late the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al seat of the <hi>Persian</hi> Kings, hath in it above two hundred thousand men. <hi>Grand-Caire</hi> amongst all the Cities in <hi>Africk,</hi> is the chiefest, being the store-house, not only of the riches of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but of much of <hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>India.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For his ordinary revenews they are not estimated to exceed eight millions of gold, but his extraordinary escheates are very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as his confiscations, forfeitures, fines, amerciaments, tributes, customes, tenths of all Prizes taken by sea, or Land, &amp;c. which far exceed his standing revenew: His Bassa's, and great officers, sucking out the blood of his poor subjects, and heaping up inestimable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, which usually falls to the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> coffers. His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents also amount to a great value: for no Ambassadour can come before him without great gifts: none can get Offices, or preferments without money: none may return to him from their Provinces, or expeditions, empty-handed: In brief, its easy for so great a Tyrant to pick a quarrel with any rich man, and so to take away his life, and seize upon his estate be it never so much.</p>
               <p>The strength of his Empire consists especially in these four things. In his <hi>Timariots,</hi> which are horsemen, to whom hee hath given lands
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:103995:88"/>
for their life, upon condition of serving him upon all occasions with men and horses: by these, as with a bridle, hee keeps all the rest of his Subjects in his vast Empire in awe: for they can no sooner move, but they shall have these <hi>Timariots,</hi> as Falcons in their necks, for to that purpose they are dispersed all over his Dominions: and again, out of them hee is always able to draw into the field one hundred and fifty thousand horse-men well armed, without a farthing charge, to go whither soever hee shall command them. The whole number of them is accounted to bee seven hundred and ninety thousand fighting men: whereof two hundred fifty seven thousand dwell in <hi>Europe,</hi> the other four hundred sixty and two thousand in <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Affrica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, In his <hi>Spahi, Ulufagi,</hi> and <hi>Carapici</hi> of his Court, which are another sort of horse-men, to whom hee gives pay, being indeed the Seminaries of the great Officers, and Governours of his Empire, for from amongst them, hee chooseth his <hi>Sanzacks,</hi> or Captaines, whom for their good deserts, he raiseth to be <hi>Begs, Begler-begs, Visiers,</hi> and <hi>Bassaes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Besides these, hee hath other horse-men, called <hi>Acanzii,</hi> which for some priviledges are bound to serve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are of the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants whom hee much esteems not, only they serve to blunt his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies swords.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In his footmen, and <hi>Janisaries,</hi> which are born of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian parents in <hi>Europe,</hi> and taken from them when they are young, and in whom there appeareth the greatest strength, activity, and courage: They are bred up to hard labour and pains, and after a certain time are taken into the Cloisters of the <hi>Aiamoglans</hi> (for so they are called, till they bee admitted into the number of <hi>Janisaries</hi>) and there delivered to governours, who keep them still exercised to pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful labour, using them hardly in apparrel, diet, and lodging: there they learn to shoot in Bows, and Guns, the use of the Scimiter, and feats of activity, and when they are expert therein, they are admitted into the number of <hi>Janisaries,</hi> or <hi>Spahi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for his strength by sea, hee hath as great means to set forth a Fleet as any Prince whatsoever, the overgrown woods of <hi>Epirus,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> with those of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and <hi>Trapezund,</hi> yeild him abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Timber for ships, and Gallies: neither can he want shipwrights and Carpenters for the framing of them, his large pay drawing many, even from amongst the Christians into his Arsenals at <hi>Constantinople, Synope, Callipolis,</hi> &amp;c. Neither hath hee ever wanted good store of expert Sea-men: for besides those which hee hath in the forenamed places, out of his Gallies, which hee hath at <hi>Lesbos, Chios, Rhodes, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus,</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and from the Pyrates which frequent his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens of <hi>Tunis, Bugia, Tripolis,</hi> and <hi>Algeirs,</hi> hee can as need requires, chuse Captains, Marriners,, and rowers, sufficient for the storing, and managing of his Fleet. Notwithstanding all which, this vast Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire is much declined of late: their late Emperors much degenerating from their warlike Progenitors, their souldiers generally addicting themselves to unwonted pleasures, their ancient discipline of warre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:103995:88"/>
neglected: their Religion, or superstition rather, not with so much zeal, as of old, regarded, and rebellions in diverse parts of the Empire, of late strangely raised, and mightily supported, being all signs of a declining state. See <hi>Knolles</hi> his discourse hereof.</p>

                     </gap>i</hi> in the Country of <hi>Genoa,</hi> being a man of projecting wit, excellently skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Astronomy, and Navigation, strongly conceited that some Lands must needs lye in the portion of the circle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which should make up the World into a Globe; considering also the motion of the Sun, hee perswaded himself that there was another world, to which the Sun imparted his light, when hee went out of our Horison. This world hee hoped to discover, and therefore imparted his intent to the <hi>Genowaies,</hi> but was by them rejected. Then sent hee his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Bartholomew Columbus,</hi> to motion the matter to our King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, but hee, falling into the hand of Pyrates by the way, was long a prisoner before hee was enlarged; but as soon as hee was free, hee came to our <hi>English</hi> Court, and his motion was readily embraced by the King: But God, who had otherwise disposed it, so ordered it, that <hi>Columbus,</hi> not knowing of his Brothers imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because hee heard nothing from him, thought that his suit was rejected, and thereupon addressed himself to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who after many delayes, furnished him with two ships only for disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very: with this small assistance hee sailed in the Ocean more than threescore dayes, without discovery of any land, so that his discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented <hi>Spaniards</hi> began to mutiny, absolutely resolving to go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Columbus</hi> did all that hee could to pacifie and incourage them, but when nothing would prevail, hee was fain to ingage himself to them, that if land was not discovered within three dayes, hee would steer his course back again: At the end of which time one of the company discryed fire, an evident sign of land, which they took possession of, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1492. and <hi>Columbus</hi> in honour of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> called it <hi>Hispaniola:</hi> after which hee discovered <hi>Cuba,</hi> and so with much treasure, and greater content hee returned into <hi>Spain</hi>; and after two other voyages hee sickned, and dyed, and was buried at <hi>Sivil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Columbus</hi> being on a time at supper with some of the great <hi>Spanish Dons</hi> in the Court, they took occasion to speak very sleightly of his <hi>Indian</hi> discoveries, as if it was such a small matter which might have been performed by any man: Hee hearing them, called for an Egge, and when hee had it, desired them to try if any of them could make it stand an end upon their trenchers: they all tryed, and by indeavouring equally to poise it, laboured to make it stand, but could not; then did <hi>Columbus</hi> take it, and knocking it down pretty hard, crackt the end, which caused it to stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: at this they all laughed, saying, <hi>that every fool could do so:</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:103995:89"/>
Yea (saith hee) and now I have made a discovery of that new world, every one can go thither, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>VVhen the <hi>Spaniards</hi> first arrived in those parts, they found the Inhabitants naked, unacquainted with husbandry, making their bread of <hi>Cassavy</hi> roots, worshiping the Devils, whom they called <hi>Zemes,</hi> in remembrance of whom they had certain Images made of Cotton-wool, like to our Childrens babies: To these they did great reverence, as supposing the spirit of their <hi>Zemes</hi> to bee in them: and the Devil to blind them the more, would sometimes make these Puppets move, and make a noise: they stood also in great fear of them, for if they did not fulfil his will, the Devil would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute vengeance upon some of the Children of these poor deluded souls. They thought the Christians to bee immortal, wondring at the Masts, Sails, and tacklings of their ships, and to try whether they were immortal or no, having taken some straglers, they held their heads under water till they were strangled, which made them change their opinions. They esteemed gold and silver no more than dross, yet for the colours sake adorned themselves therewith, as they did with shells, feathers, and the like.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> after their coming amongst them behaved themselves very cruelly, killing them like sheep, and forcing them like beasts, to labour in their Mines, to carry their burthens, and to do all manner of drudgery, which caused them so to hate them, that one <hi>Haythney</hi> a noble man amongst them being perswaded to bee baptised, with the promise of Heaven for his reward; asked whither the <hi>Spaniards</hi> went when they dyed? and when answer was made that they went to Heaven, hee renounced his intended Baptisme, protesting <hi>that hee had rather go to Hell, with the unbaptised, than to live in Heaven with so cruel a people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In some places there was such abundance of gold, that in some Mines they found more gold than earth, which the <hi>Indians</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed greedily for Hammers; Knives, Axes, Hatchets, and such tools of Iron; for before, they were fain to make their Canows or Boats plain without, of the body of a great tree which they made hollow with the force of fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Columbus</hi> having thus happily begun this noble enterprize, hee was seconded by <hi>Americus Vesputio,</hi> a <hi>Florentine,</hi> from whom (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly) it was called <hi>America.</hi> To him succeeded <hi>John Cabot,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by our King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh. <hi>Ferdinando Magellane</hi> first found out the South passage, called the streights of <hi>Magellane,</hi> by which hee compassed the world, and was afterwards followed by our <hi>Drake,</hi> and <hi>Candish</hi>; and the Dutch <hi>Nandernoort:</hi> since which time another Dutchman called <hi>Le Maire,</hi> found out a more Southerly passage into the South Sea, called <hi>Le Maires Streights,</hi> by which hee also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed the world.</p>

               <p>This Fortresse was built on an hill on the North side of the City of <hi>Cusco,</hi> the hill was so steep on one side, that that way it could not bee assaulted, and therefore one wall served on that side, which was two hundred fathoms long: On the other sides they made three walls, one without another, each being above two hundred fathoms, and were made in the fashion of an half Moon, in which there were stones admirably great: each wall had in the middest one gate, which was covered over with one entire stone: each wall stood thirty foot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the other, and at the top of them the battlements were above a yard high: Within those walls there were three strong forts, the middlemost was round, which had in it a Conduit of very good water, brought under ground from far.

               <p>The gold in <hi>Chily</hi> is gotten two wayes: One, by washing the earth in great trays of wood; the earth by washing wasteth, and the Gold remaineth in the bottome. The other is by art to draw it out of the Mines: every shower is a shower of gold: for with the violence of the water falling from the Mountains, it brings from them gold along with it.

Another Lake there is that is partly salt, partly fresh, being twenty five miles long, and eight broad.

Ants were as noisome to them, as Grashoppers in other parts of the world; they spoiled their fruits, and fruit trees; they could keep nothing in their houses, which was fit to bee eaten, from them, and had they continued, they would have unpeopled the Island. There are worms also which do such harm in Timber, that a house will scarce stand here thirty years: when the King in this Countrey died, they buried the best beloved of his Concubines with him, who also had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther women buried for to attend upon them in the other World, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their Jewels and Ornaments: they had also set in their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre a Cup of water, and some of their Cassavi bread. <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1508, here happened such an Hurricane as threw down most of the houses in <hi>Domingo,</hi> and <hi>Bona ventura,</hi> destroied twenty sail of ships, lifted up many men into the air, who falling down again were miserably bruised.</p>

               <p>The soil of the Country in the Vallies, and sides of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains is so fruitful, that without the labour of man it naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth great plenty of Pease, and Vetches, as full, and wholesome as ours in <hi>England:</hi> Other places produce plenty of Grass: There are Strawberries red, and white, and Rasberries as fair, and good as ours in <hi>England</hi>: Multitude of Bilberries, and other delicate Berries, in great abundance: There are also Pears, Cherries, Filbeards, &amp;c. There are Herbs for Sallets, and broth, as Parsley, Alexander, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,

&amp;c. As also Flowers, as Red, and Damask-Roses, with others; beautiful, and delightful both to the eye, and smell: There are also diverse Physical Herbs, and Roots. Some Corn that our men have sowed proved very good, and yeelded great increase: so do Cabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Carrats, Turneps, Lettice, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the Country there are great store of Deer, Hares, Foxes, Squir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, Beavers, Wolves, Bears, and other kindes of Beasts, both for necessity, profit, and delight. Besides great numbers of small Birds, there are Hawks, great and small, Partridges, Thrustles, Nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingals, &amp;c. As also Ravens, Gripes, Crowes, &amp;c. besides plenty of water-Fowle, as Geese, Ducks, Gulls, Penguines, Pigeons, &amp;c. Of these there is such abundance, that the Fisher-men which yearly trade thither finde great refreshing by them.</p>
               <p>The Country yeelds store of Rivers, and Springs, pleasant, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, and wholesome: together with abundance of fuel for the fire; besides Timber Trees, as Fir, Spruce, fit for Masts of ships; from whence also comes abundance of Turpentine: Pines also, and Birch-Trees, &amp;c. The Rivers, and Harbours are stored with deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Fish, as Salmons, Pearles, Eeles, Herrings, Makarel, Flounders, Cods, Trouts, as large, fat, and sweet as any in the world: Besides Lobsters, Crab-fish, Muscles, &amp;c. There are also Beavers, Otters, &amp;c. The Seas along the shore yeeld Whales, Spanish-Makarel, Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, Pales, Herring, Porposses, Seales, &amp;c. Especially by their Cod-fishing, both our own, and other Nations are much enriched. Two hundred and fifty sail of Ships go thither usually in one year from <hi>England.</hi>

                     </gap>nick</hi> Frier, and Bishop in <hi>America,</hi> who wrote in the year 1542. saith thus of them. The <hi>Indians</hi> are a simple, harmless people, loyal to their Lords, and such as gave no occasion of offence to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> till by their extream injuries they provoked them thereto. To these Lambs (saith hee) the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> came as cruel, and hungry Tygers, Bears, and Lions, intending nothing for these forty years but blood, and slaughter to satisfie their avarice and ambition: Insomuch that of three millions of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, that they found in <hi>Hispaniola</hi> there remains not one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cuba,</hi> and the other Islands indured the like miseries; and in the firm land ten Kingdomes, greater than all <hi>Spain,</hi> were dis-peopled, and left desolate, in which there perished not less than twelve mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions by their tyranny, hee might as truly have said fifty millions.</p>
               <p>Their cruelties at their first planting in <hi>Hispaniola</hi> drave the poor <hi>Indians</hi> to their shifts, and to their weak defence, which so enraged these Lions, that they spared neither man, woman, nor child: yea they ripped up the great bellied women<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and used to lay wagers which of them could with greatest dexterity cut off an <hi>Indians</hi> head, or cut him in sunder in the midst: They would pluck the Infants by the heels from their Mothers breasts, and dash out their brains a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the stones, or throw them into the River. They set up Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets, and in honour of Christ, and his Apostles (as they used pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:103995:97"/>
to say) they would both hang, and burn them. Others they took, and cutting their hands almost off, bid them carry letters to their Country-men, who for fear of these Tyrants were fled into the Mountains: The Nobles, and chiefest men they broiled on Gridirons: I once (saith mine Author) saw four or five of them thus roasted, and when they made a lamentable noise, they stopped their mouthes, and so made them indure the torment till they dyed. They kept Dogs to hunt them out of their coverts, which devoured these poor souls: and if at any time an <hi>Indian</hi> thus provoked, killed a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> they made a Law, that one hundred of them should bee slain for him: One of the Kings proffered to till the ground for them for fifty miles space, if they would spare him, and his people from the Mines; but for recompence, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Captain deflou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his wife, and took him prisoner, and sent him into <hi>Spain,</hi> where hee perished by the way.</p>
               <p>In another Province of <hi>Hispaniola,</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Governour called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him three hundred <hi>Indian</hi> Lords, some of them hee burned, slew others with the sword, and hanged up the Queen; as they did also in another Province: and for the rest which remained after these Butcheries, they shared them amongst them for slaves. The men they consumed in the Mines, the women by tillage, and by heavy burdens that they made them to carry, and both by famine, scourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and other miseries.</p>
               <p>And thus they did in all other places whithersoever they came: In the Islands of St. <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Jamica</hi> were six hundred thousand Inhabitants, and within few years, there were scarcely two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>undred left in either of them: In <hi>Cuba</hi> a Cacique, or Lord, called all his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects together, and shewed them a box of gold, saying, <hi>This is the Spaniards God,</hi> and made them dance about it, and then hurled it into the River: And afterwards being taken, and condemned to the fire, when hee was bound to the stake, a Frier came and preached to him about Heaven, and Hell: The Cacique asked <hi>if any Spaniards were in Heaven?</hi> yea (said the Frier) such as were good: Then said the Cacique, <hi>I will rather go to Hell, than come where any of that cruel Nation are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I was once present (saith <hi>Casas</hi>) when the Inhabitants of a Town brought us forth victuals, and met us with great kindness, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> without any cause given, slew three thousand of them, neither sparing age, nor sex. At another time (saith hee) at their request, I sent to other Towns to meet us, promising them good u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, and when two and twenty Caciques met us, our Captain against all Faith, caused them to bee burned; which base usage caused the poor <hi>Indians</hi> to hang themselves: so that a <hi>Spaniard</hi> seeing them take this course, hee made them beleeve that hee would also hang him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, to persecute them in the other world, which kept some from this self-execution. Six thousand Children dyed in three, or four months space of Famine, their Parents being sent away to the Mines; the rest they hunted out in the Mountains, and desolate Islands.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:103995:98"/>
In the Land of <hi>Lucaia</hi> they destroyed all, and when they shipped mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of them for the Mines in <hi>Hispaniola,</hi> for want of food, a third part of them commonly perished by the way, so that an unskilful Pilot might have been directed his way by these floating Carkasses. The like havock they made in the Continent, almost unpeopling all places whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they came. From <hi>Dariena</hi> to <hi>Nicaragua,</hi> they slew four hundred thousand people with Dogs, sword, fire, and other torments.</p>
               <p>They used to send Friers to Preach, that under pain of confiscation, and losse of Lands, Liberty, Life, &amp;c. they should acknowledge God, and the King of <hi>Spain</hi>: yea they would steal to some places, and half a mile off of the citys by night they would make this Proclamation where none heard it, and then in the Night whilst they were asleep, fire their houses, slaying, and taking Captive at their pleasures, and then fall to search for gold. A certain Cacique gave the <hi>Spanish</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the weight of nine thousand Crowns in gold, and hee by way of requital to extort more, bound him to a post, and putting fire to his feet, forced him to send home for three thousand more, and yet not satisfied, hee persisted to torment him, till the marrow came forth of his feet, wherewith hee died; when any of the <hi>Indians</hi> fainted under their grievous burdens, or for want of food, the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> least they should loose time in undoing the chain wherein they were tyed, they would cut off his head, and so let the body fall out. At another time they robbed the <hi>Nicaraguans</hi> of their Corn: whereby thirty thousand of them died of famine, and a mother was driven to eat her own child: besides, five hundred thousand were carried away into bondage, and fifty or sixty thousand more were slain in their warres: so that in one of the most populous Regions in the World (saith <hi>Casas</hi>) there remain not above four or five thousand persons. <hi>Cortes</hi> used to have four Kings to wait upon him: hee burned sixty Kings, their children looking on. Another <hi>Spaniard</hi> cast four of their Kings to bee devoured by his dogs.</p>
               <p>In <hi>New-Spain</hi> from the year 1518 to 1530. within the compasse of four hundred and eighty miles about <hi>Mexico,</hi> they destroyed above four millions of people by fire, and sword, besides those that dyed by miserable servitude and drudgery. In the Province of <hi>Naco</hi> and <hi>Honduras</hi> in the space of eleven years, two millions of men perished by the same ways. In <hi>Guatimala,</hi> in sixteen years space, were destroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed five millions of souls. <hi>Alvarado,</hi> who was the instrument of this destruction dyed by the fall of his horse, and had his City of <hi>Guati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mala</hi> destroyed, and overwhelmed by a threefold deluge, of Earth, water, and stones. In his expeditions, he forced the <hi>Indians</hi> by ten, or twenty thousand at a time to go with him, allowing them no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sustenance, but the flesh of their slain enemys, keeping in his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Shambles of mans flesh.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Panuco</hi> and <hi>Xalisco,</hi> they exercised the like cruelties: One of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> forced eight thousand of the <hi>Indians</hi> to wall about his Garden, and suffered them all to perish with Famine. In <hi>Machua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi> they tortured the King that came forth to meet them, that they
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:103995:98"/>
might extort gold from him: they set his feet in the stocks, and put fire thereto, binding his hands to a Post behind him, and then had a boy standing by, that basted his roasted feet with Oil: Another stood with a Cross-bow bent against his breast, and a third stood with Dogs ready to devour him, by these tortures hee dyed. They forced the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to bring them their gods, hoping they had been of gold, but when their golden hopes failed, they forced them to redeem them again with Gold. Yea where the Fryers had forced the <hi>Indians</hi> to cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their gods, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> brought more from other places to sell them. In the Province of St. <hi>Martha,</hi> they laid utterly waste and desolate four hundred and fifty miles of land, by destroying the Inhabitants: The like they did in the Kingdome of <hi>Venezula,</hi> where they destroyed four or five millions. Besides, they carried of them Captive out of the Continent into the Islands, a million of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>They spared no sort of persons; plucked the Children from the breasts to quarter them to their dogs, tortured Kings with new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices borrowed either from the Inquisition, or from hell: they used to cut off the Noses, and hands of men and women that lived peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with them: they sold Fathers, Mothers, Children, asunder into diverse places, and to diverse persons never to meet again: they used to ly with the women, that being with child they might yeild them the more mony in their sale. The <hi>Spanish</hi> Priests used to devote them with Curses to the Devil, and taught them vices by their evil practises and examples, insomuch as one said, <hi>Hee would perswade the King of</hi> Spain <hi>to send no more Priests into</hi> America. They teach them Usury, Lying, Swearing, Blasphemy. A Caciques son that was towardly in his youth, and proved after dissolute, being asked the reason of it, said, <hi>since I was a Christian, I have learned to swear several sorts of Oaths, to Dice, to Lye, to swagger, and now I want nothing but a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine, to make mee a compleat Christian:</hi> This made them to say, that of all Gods the Christians God was the worst, which had such bad ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and to wish for their own gods again, of whom they never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived so much hurt as from the Christians. <hi>A Christian</hi> (said one of them) <hi>is one that impiously demands Maiz, Honey, Silk, Raiment, an Indian woman to lye with; they call for gold and silver, are idle and will not work, are Gamesters, Dicers, wicked Blasphemers, Backbiters, Quarrellers, &amp;c.</hi> And taking a peece of Gold, hee said, <hi>Loe this is the Christians God: For this they kill us, and one another, for this they play, blaspheme, curse, steal, and do all manner of villanies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Peru</hi> they had publike places of torture, whereinto they might put a thousand of the miserable Creatures at once, by exquisite tortures to force them to a confession of their hidden treasures: such as escaped these, used to hang themselves in the Mountains, and their wives by them, and their little children at their feet. By Dogs at Land they worried them, and in their Pearl fishings, exposed them to the ravenous Sharks in the seas; by fire, and sword consuming twenty millions of people, since the <hi>Jesuits</hi> went amongst them. These
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:103995:99"/>
and infinite more, have been the cruelties which the cruel <hi>Spaniards</hi> have exercised upon the poor, naked, innocent people: Our Author, a Papist, that relates these things, least any should think that hee wrote too much, protests that they were a thousand times worse than hee had set down, the Reading whereof might astonish the sence of the Reader, amaze his Reason, exceed his faith, and fill his heart with horror, and uncouth passions. It is no marvel that God follows such bloody beasts with his vengeance, as lately hee hath done (if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation be true) which cometh from the mouths of some of themselves, lately taken by some of our Frigots upon the Coast of <hi>Spain,</hi> as they came out of these Countryes, whereof the Narrative follows.</p>
               <p>The Marquesse of <hi>Baydex,</hi> now taken by our Fleet neer <hi>Cadiz,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on examination saith, that above five months since there happened in <hi>Lima</hi> a fearfull Earthquake, and a most miraculous rain of fire in <hi>Peru,</hi> insomuch that the whole City of <hi>Lima</hi> is swallowed up, and destroyed, as also the City of <hi>Calao,</hi> in which places there perished above eleven thousand <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and (through the wonderful distinguishing hand of God) not above one hundred <hi>Indians.</hi> In the City of <hi>Lima</hi> the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath lost by the Earthquake, one hundred Millions of silver ready wrought up. Also the famous Mines of <hi>Potozi,</hi> where they had their greatest quantities of silver, are destroyed in a wonderfull manner, so that the hill is not to be seen, but all is plain, nor is there any further possibility of having gold, or silver in <hi>Peru:</hi> Some of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themselves acknowledge, that this judgement is justly befaln them for their cruelty to the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> who crying to God for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, have pulled down this visible hand of God upon them.</p>

Hee would get him to his Couch at the setting of the Sun, and rise again at the Sun-rising. One day they brought him to the haven, and let him go into the Sea, but to prevent his escape, they set three rows of very strong nets before him, to catch him again at their pleasure: but hee, streightwaies diving to the bottom, crept under all their nets, and shewed himself again to them, and so often diving, hee still came up, and looked upon them that stood on the shoar, as it were mocking of them.

               <head>CHAP. VI. The wonderful works of God in the Creatures. Of strange Beasts, and Serpents.</head>
               <p>WHilst Sir <hi>Thomas Row,</hi> our <hi>English</hi> Ambassador, was at the great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                  <hi>Moguls</hi> Court, hee saw many stately Elephants brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Emperor: some of which being <hi>Lord-Elephants</hi> (as they called them) had their chains, bells, and furniture of gold, and sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, each of them having eight, or ten other <hi>Elephants</hi> waiting on him: they were some twelve companies in all, and as they passed by, they all bowed down before the King very handsomely. <hi>Pur. Pil.</hi> v. 1. p. 550.</p>
               <p>Though these <hi>Elephants</hi> be the largest of all beasts, yet are they very tractable, unless at such times when they are mad through lust:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> some of them are thirteen, and some fifteen foot high; their colour is usually black, their skins thick, and smooth without hair; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light much to bathe themselves in water, and are excellent swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:103995:112"/>
their pace is about three miles an hour; of all Beasts they are most sure of foot, so that they never stumble, or fall to indanger their rider: they lye down, and rise again at pleasure, as other beasts do; they are most docible creatures, doing almost whatsoever their Keeper commands them. If hee bid one of them afright a man, hee will make towards him, as if hee would tread him in peeces; and yet when hee comes at him, do him no hurt: If hee bid him abuse, or disgrace a man, hee will take dirt, or kennel-water in his trunk, and dash it in his face, &amp;c. Their trunks are long, grissely snouts hanging down betwixt their teeth, which (as a hand) they make use of upon all occasions. Some <hi>Elephants</hi> the great <hi>Mogul</hi> keeps for execution of malefactors; who being brought to suffer death by that mighty beast, if the Keeper bid him dispatch the offender pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, hee will immediatly with his foot pash him in peeces: If hee bid him torture him slowly, hee will break his joynts by degrees one after another, as men are broken upon the wheel.</p>
               <p>An <hi>English</hi> Merchant of good credit being at <hi>Adsmeer</hi> (a City where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the great <hi>Mogul</hi> then was) saw a great <hi>Elephant</hi> daily brought through the Market-place, where an Hearb-woman used to give him an handful of herbs as hee passed by. This <hi>Elephant</hi> afterwards being mad, brake his chains, and took his way through the Market-place; the people being affrighted, hasted to secure themselves, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom was this Hearb-woman, who through fear, and haste, forgat her little childe. The <hi>Elephant</hi> comming to the place where shee usually sate, stopt, and seeing a childe lye about her hearbs, took it up gently with his Trunk, and without harm, laid it upon a stall hard by, and then proceeded in his furious course. <hi>Idem.</hi> p. 1472. The Males Testicles lye about his forehead: the Females teates are betwixt her fore legs; they carry their young two years in their wombs: conceive but once in seven years: they are thirty years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come to their full growth, and fulfil the accustomed age of a man before they dye.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Pyrrus</hi> King of <hi>Epyrus</hi> was assaulting the City of <hi>Argos,</hi> one of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of his <hi>Elephants</hi> called <hi>Nicon. i. e.

               <p>The <hi>Lion</hi> hath the <hi>Jackall</hi> for his Usher, which is a little black, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> shag-haired beast, of the bigness of a Spaniel, which when the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comes, hunts for his prey, and comming on the foot, follows the scent with open crye: to which the <hi>Lion</hi> as chief Hunt gives dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ear, following for his advantage: If the <hi>Jackall</hi> set up his chase before the <hi>Lion</hi> comes in, hee howles out mainly, and then the <hi>Lion</hi> seizeth on it, making a grumbling noise, whilst his servant stands

               <p>The <hi>Panther</hi> hath a very sweet smell, so that other Beasts are much taken therewith, but they are terrified with the ugly deformity of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> face, and therefore as hee goes hee hides that part between his legs, and will not look towards them till hee hath gotten them within his compasse, which when hee hath done, hee devours them without mercy: so deals the Devil with wicked men, strewing their way to Hell with variety of worldly delights, and profits (the thorns of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions must not touch their flesh, nor hells terrors come within their thoughts) till hee hath made them past feeling, than hee devours them. <hi>Plin. nat. Hist.</hi> L. 8 C. 17.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rhynoceros</hi> is so called because of the horn in his nose: hee is a large beast, as big as our fairest Oxe in <hi>England:</hi> His skin lyeth pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> and as it were in wrinkles upon his back: Their Horn, Teeth, Claws, yea flesh, and blood, are good against poyson, which as is conceived, proceeds from the Herbs which they feed on in <hi>Bengala,</hi> where are most store of them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Camelopardalus</hi> is the highest of Beasts, so that a man on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back may ride upright under his belly, his neck is long, so that hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> usually feedeth upon the leaves of trees: his colour is white and speck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, his hinder legs are shorter than his former, so that he cannot graze but with difficulty. <hi>P.

               <p>In <hi>India</hi> is a certain beast called a <hi>Buffelo,</hi> which is very large, hath a thick and smooth skin, but without hair: She gives good milk, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> her flesh is like beefe. <hi>Idem.</hi> p. 1469.</p>
               <p>In the same Country also are certain wild Goats, whose horns are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> good against poison. <hi>Pur. Pil.</hi> p. 472.</p>
               <p>In the Country of <hi>Indostan</hi> in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> are large white <hi>Apes,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> as big as our Grey-hounds, which will eat young birds, whereupon Nature hath taught their Dams this subtilty: they build their Nests on the utmost boughs at the end of slender twigs: where they hang them like Purse-nets, to which the Apes cannot possibly come: yet many times with their hands they will shake those boughs til the nests break, and fall down, and then they will devour them. <hi>Pur. Pilgrimag.</hi> p. 1475.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Camelion</hi> is of the shape, and bigness of a <hi>Lizzard,</hi> it is a deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> lean, and crooked creature, having a long and slender tail, like a Mouse, and is of a slow pace. It lives only upon Flys. It changeth colours accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the variety of places where it comes. It is a great enemy to venemous Serpents, for when it sees any lye sleeping under a Tree, it gets upon a bough just over the Serpents head, and voideth out of its mouth, as it were a long thred of Spittle, with a round drop hanging at the end, which falling on the Serpents head, immediately kills him. <hi>P.

               <p>There was lately found in <hi>Catalunia,</hi> in the Mountains of <hi>Cerdania,</hi> a certain Monster, that had humane shape as far as the waste, and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> it was like a Satyre: Hee had many heads, Arms, and Eyes,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:103995:113"/>
and a mouth of extraordinary bignesse, wherewith hee made a noise like a Bull: His picture was sent by <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> (now Governour of the <hi>Low Countryes)</hi> to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards many Coppies thereof. were drawn, and sent abroad by Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors, and other persons to several Princes, and States in <hi>Europe.

His head is small; and hath a thin snout: his mouth round, with a tongue three quarters of a yard long: hee is diligent in seeking Ant-hills, which hee tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with his claws, and then thrusts in his long tongue, upon which the Ants run, and when it is full hee licks them in, and this is all his food. <hi>Pur.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> The <hi>Armadillo</hi> is of the bignesse of a Pig, and of a white colour: It hath a long snout, and the body is covered with shels like Plates, wherwith they are armed: for they are so hard that no arrow will pierce them except in the Flanks, where they are softer: their flesh is good to eat, they dig holes in the ground with their snouts, in which they lye. <hi>Idem.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Civet Cat</hi> exceeds the Castor for bignesse, her head is little, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> her eyes cleer; hath a long muzzle; sharp, and offensive teeth. Her hair is parti-coloured, harsh, and bristley, yellow above, and whiter down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; The pocket wherein the Civet is bred is neer the genitory, which is taken forth with a spoon or stick; But when shee is wild, shee casts it forth of her own accord, and by the sent it is found by the passengers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>Affrick,</hi> are more fierce than in colder Countryes; here <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> was one of their skins brought into <hi>England,</hi> which from the snout to the top of the tail, contained one and twenty foot in length. They engender backwards as do Camels, Elephants, Rhinoceroses, Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Tygers. They spare such men as prostrate themselves to them, and prey rather upon men than women, and not at all on In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants except compelled by hunger. His tail is his Scepter, by which hee expresses his passion. Hee shrinks not at danger, except some covert of woods hides him from witnesses, and then he will take the benefit of flight, which otherwise he seems to disdain.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hyaena</hi> hath no joints in her neck, and therefore stirrs not her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> neck, but with the bending of her whole body. Shee hath one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued tooth through her whole mouth.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Zebra</hi> is a very beautiful Creature, resembling a curiously <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> shaped horse, but not all out so swift, all overlaid with party coloured lades, and guards from head to tail.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/>
