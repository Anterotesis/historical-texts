            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Deſcription of the great Eclipſe that will fall out this year, 1652.</head>
            <p>FOur times ſhall the bright Lamps of Heaven be deprived this year, thrice ſhall the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of the earth loſe the light of the Sun by the interpoſition of the opacious body of the
Moon, betwixt their ſight and him; and twice ſhall the Moon be deprived of her borrowed
light, by the direct interpoſition of the earth betwixt the Sun and her: Both of the Moon, and
the firſt of the Sun will be conſpicuous to us.</p>
            <p>The first is of the Moon, and happens according to the <hi>Julian</hi> account with us, the 15.
day of <hi>March,</hi> at which time will the Moons Body be darkned. The beginning ſhall be ſeen
only in the Eaſtern parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the whole in the Weſtern: In <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> it
will not be diſcerned.</p>
            <p>For the better underſtanding of the effects of this Eclipſe of the Moon <hi>March</hi> 15. I will
parallel it with a former Eclipſe, which by tracing Antiquity I find hapned 1345. three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and ſeven years ſince, being within one degree of the Zodiak in the ſame ſign as this,
wherein the poſition of Heaven not much differed from what it is now. The principal effects
which that Eclipſe produced, were theſe; great tempeſts, mighty high winds, great flouds
through abundance of rain, which continued all Summer, and moſt part of Autumn that year,
inſomuch, that in theſe Northern Regions Corn did putrifie and rot upon the ground by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the exceſs of wet, and great corruption and decay of all fruits, as alſo a great rot of ſheep,
ſo that for two years next following, there was a great ſcarcity and dearth in moſt Countries,
many Diſeaſes and ſudden deaths amongſt Chriſtians; much Wars ſlaughters and blood-ſhed
was in the world during the effects of this Eclipſe. The ſame year on St. <hi>Pauls</hi> day, was ſo
great an Earth-quake in <hi>Germany,</hi> that many Villages and Bridges were overthrown, and
horrible Rains mixed with <hi>Toads,</hi> annoyed the Inhabitants. In the year 1346. the 28.
day of the Moneth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> wax the ſharp, yet famous Battel fought in <hi>France,</hi> near the
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>illage of <hi>Creſſye,</hi> between <hi>Phylip</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, and <hi>Edward</hi> the third then King
of <hi>England,</hi> where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with a weak power in compariſon, gave the <hi>French</hi> a total
overthrowe: the King of <hi>Bohemiah</hi> his Son, newly elected Emperor, was overthrown
with the King of <hi>France,</hi> who was brought priſoner into <hi>England,</hi> the King of <hi>Bohemiah</hi>
ſlain in the field, and many gallants more: And in the ſame year, on the 17. of <hi>October</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
a party of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> under the Command of <hi>Mowbray,</hi> and Queen <hi>Phylip,</hi> who
in the Kings abſence were left to guard the marches of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and lay upon the Borders of
<hi>England,</hi> to hinder the Invaſion of the <hi>Scots:</hi> theſe gave battel to the <hi>Scotch</hi> King, and
all his Forces near <hi>Nevil-Crofle,</hi> in which Battel the <hi>Scotch</hi> King was taken priſoner,
and the chiefeſt of the Nobility were all ſlain and taken. Thus had the <hi>Engliſh</hi> three great
Princes at once priſoners; thus as trouble, ſo Honour Victory did attend the <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
during the effects of this Eclipſe, they were crowned on every ſide with glory and Renown.
I queſtion not but the true <hi>Engliſh</hi> power will be as victorious: let <hi>Scotland, France,</hi> the
<hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> beware of too much provocations. Some vctions of the like nature will
be attempted to compleat the <hi>Engliſh</hi> glory. The ſame year the 2. of <hi>Auguſt, Callice</hi> was
yielded to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which had been long beſieged; thus Renowned were the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in
all parts, the Reaſons in art I have not room to inſert.</p>
            <p>During the effects of this Eclipſe, the Hereſie of the <hi>Adamites</hi> ſprang up in <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi>
and <hi>John Wickliets</hi> opinions in <hi>England.</hi> In the year 1347. and 1348. was ſo
great mortality and peſtilence, the like had not been ſeen before, and people were
ſtricken with horror and fear, by reaſon of the violent Feavers, Apoſthumes, and
ſwellings in their Bodies, of which they died extreamly, and continued ſo long,
that they were out of hope. Theſe evills I fear overmuch will be the effects of this
Eclipſe amongſt us.</p>

The firſt Eclipſe is of the Sun, <hi>March</hi> 29. 15. minutes, 53. ſeconds after 10. in
the forenoon, at which time <hi>Sol</hi> the glorious eye of Heaven will be darkened, by
reaſon of the interpoſition of the Moons opacious body betwixt our ſight &amp; him,
and will appear to us as a yellowiſh green colour, mixt (as it were) with red, as bluſhing to uphold us, will almoſt quite hold his head from us.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>Places which will feel the ſmart of this Eclipſe may be gathered out of the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Diſcourſe; but more plainly thoſe Countries under <hi>Aries, Cancer,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorn.
Saturn</hi> Lord of the eighth in the Aſcendant, threatens <hi>Scotland, Ireland,</hi> the
Weſt and North of <hi>England,</hi> with divers and ſore ſickneſſes, as alſo the Peſtilence:
Before the effects of this Eclipſe be over, let <hi>London</hi> pray for a Reprieve; for about
this time there will be a great decay in her Health and Trading: Let <hi>France</hi> take
heed, the flame is there breaking forth: The Emperour of <hi>Germany</hi> begins to tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
The <hi>Hollander</hi> ſuffers prejudice by Sea: And the Turkiſh Territories are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
with factions: Let the glory of <hi>Rome</hi> alſo (about this time) expect an
eclipſe from the Engliſh.</p>
            <p>The ſecond will be a very terrible eclipſe of the Sun, the eye of Heaven, in the
ſame Moneth <hi>March</hi> 29. the beginning will be at half an hour paſt 9 in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<hi>Early Miſers may dreadfully behold it:</hi> the middle at 40 min. after 10. the end at
12 min. before 12 a clock. This Eclipſe continues two hours and a quarter, and
will be very fearful to behold: The Sun will be almoſt wholly darkned, onely
a little part of the lower South part of his body, like a new Moon-light; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the enſuing Figure.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>This Eclipſe will be viſible to all <hi>Europe,</hi> as alſo <hi>Aſia minor. Arabia, Perſia, Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>IF a ſerious Diſquiſition did not find guilt, and remove ſome againſt their wills
from their Dignities laſt Moneth, this will; And I tell you plainly, I ſmell ſome
new Tenets ſtudied and urged, which if not timely prevented, may produce ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

A time of mourning and lamentation draws neer upon <hi>France.</hi> Heavens gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<hi>God</hi> protect us <hi>Engliſh</hi> from ſome eminent Mortality or Plague this month,
or high diviſions amongſt the Commons and their Superiours; many mens Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits

Arrows. A great Victory ſeems to attend the Engliſh, and according to the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
of the great Eclipſe, <hi>March</hi> 29. a great Prince will be taken, and another
loſe his life in the field. From all which we may traduce, that the French King is
