            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>I Tim. II. 1, 2.</bibl>
               <q>I exhort therefore that first of all supplications, prayers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessions
and giving of thanks, be made for all men:
for Kings and all that are in Authority; that we may
lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godliness and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE visible Degeneracy of what we call Religion from
its Original in the Scripture, and its fairest Copy in the
purest Primitive times, has filled the hearts of the more
considering persons with great sadness: Could we view our faces
in that Glass, we should either correct our deformities by it, or,
as some are too ready to do, break the Glass, that it may not
at once shew us, and upbraid us with them.</p>
            <p>For whether it be that aiery Speculations have eaten out the
practice, or fiery contentions about matters of lower concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
have starved the Spirit of Zeal for the great and weighty
things of Religion; or the deluge of prophaneness which
threatens to lay morality and godliness under water, be too
strong for us to stem the Current; most certain it is, that the
Christian Religion has had its beauty so miserably effaced, has
been so wretchedly misrepresented, or so little represented to its
advantage, that its open enemies have dared to triumph over it;
and its few cordial friends have found much difficulty and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to support its credit.</p>
            <p>Amongst the many Instances of the decay of Religion in this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44573:3"/>
present Age, the great Neglect of praying to, and praising God
for our Governors supreme and subordinate, has been one, which
perhaps has render'd them less zealous for, and possibly jealous of
Christianity, as that which has not very favourable aspects upon
the Persons and Thrones of Princes; or at least the Professors of it
have horribly contradicted their own avowed Principles; and
that which they pretend to be the only Rule of their Faith, has
but a slender influence upon their Consciences.</p>
            <p>Now as I have a clear Warrant from the Text, and as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound an
Invitation from the gracious Providence of God that smiles upon
us, I will endeavour first to shew what it is we owe, and then to
awaken the sleepy Consciences of men to pay what they owe, both
in Prayer and Praise to God for Kings, and all that are in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>The Text therefore gives us clear Direction in three momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
points. 1. The <hi>Matter</hi> of our Duty; or what we owe. 2. The
<hi>Objects</hi> of the duty, or to whom we owe it. 3. The <hi>Reasons</hi> of our
duty, why we owe it. (1.) If we heedfully attend to the <hi>first</hi> of
these; or <hi>what we owe:</hi> The Text has reduced them to these four
particulars.</p>
            <p>1. That we offer up to God <hi>supplications,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: earnestly to
wrestle with the Almighty, that he would divert his anger, or
whatever calamities, judgments, plagues, may be in the womb
of that anger, from them: that his vigilant eye would discover,
his powerful hand turn away and defeat all those machinations
which may be formed against their persons and governments;
in a word, that he would secure them against those evils to which
their high station, and the discharge of their weighty duties
therein, may expose them.</p>
            <p>2. That we also present our <hi>prayers,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to God on their
behalf; that he would fill them with all those graces, wisdom,
counsel, understanding, courage, that may qualifie them for their
arduous calling: that he would prosper and crown them with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
success in all their lawful and honourable undertakings.</p>
            <p>3. That further we make <hi>intercessions,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for them, that
God would not only bless them, but make them blessings to their
Subjects, and happy instruments to procure much good to all that
come within the sphere of their power and calling.</p>
            <p>4. We owe this further, that we return <hi>thanks,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to
God for them: for all the good that they have done, or that was
in their hearts to do; for all those deliverances God has wrought
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44573:3"/>
out for us by them; and for all that courage and conduct which
God has bestow'd on them to render them serviceable; and for all
that God has done for them in their preservation.</p>
            <p>All this we owe; and are further instructed how we must pay it
from the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: which will instruct us, 1. that we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
all this with the greatest vigour of Soul, and application of
Conscience. 2. That we do it constantly with unwearied perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.
The <hi>nature</hi> of the word implies the former, and the
<hi>form</hi> of the word the latter.</p>
            <p>(2.) The <hi>Object</hi> of our duty, is express in these words, <hi>for all
men; for Kings, and all that are in authority:</hi> only be it observed,
that tho we owe to our King prayer and praise, yet these duties,
these debts must be paid to God; and we shall acquit our selves
both as Christians and good Subjects, when what we owe for
them, we do not pay it to them, but to God on their behalf.</p>
            <p>The persons to whom we owe supplication, prayer, intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and thanksgiving, are here either described in general or in
special. 1. In <hi>general,</hi> we owe it to All men: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>:
none so low but our prayers may help them; none so high
but our prayers may serve them; none so good but may need,
none so bad but may claim a share in our prayers.</p>
            <p>We are indeed taught to distinguish between the violent men
of the world, as they are our <hi>enemies,</hi> and as they are the enemies
of <hi>the Lord, and of his Christ;</hi> under the former consideration, let
us pray that God would forgive them, convert them, restrain
them; wherein if our charitable prayers reach not their hearts,
they will return into our own bosoms: And for this we have
precept from, and precedent in our Lord and Saviour, <hi>Precept.</hi>
Mat 5. 44. Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them
that hate you, pray for them that despightfully use you and persecute you,
Precedent. Luke 23. 34. <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what
they do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as they fall under the other dismal character, our prayers
ought to be of another temper, that God would convert 'em,
there we would begin; but if they proceed as implacable
enemies of Christ, we pray that he would defeat their counsels,
insatuate them in all their contrivances, break their powers, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint
them in all their expectations; and seeing we <hi>pray</hi> for no
more than we know Christ will <hi>do,</hi> that he would overthrow and
confound them and all their mischievous devices.</p>
            <p>But the Text enjoyns us not only to pray, but to <hi>give thanks</hi> for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44573:4"/>
               <hi>all men;</hi> which seems very hard to flesh and blood: We are apt
to think we behave our selves well towards <hi>all men,</hi> if we can bear
their insolences, forbear revenge, and rest content under their
provocations, and think it to be a straining of the point too far to
press us <hi>to give thanks</hi> for them: But indeed in some cases we owe
more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> than to our friends, the one will conceal, the
other divulge our failings; and seeing our hearts are so deceitful,
and our friends so partial, let's give thanks to God that we have
enemies that will watch against, and learn from thence to watch
over our selves.</p>
            <p>We are debtors to the poor and to the rich; the poorest may
lend us the subsidy of their prayers, of their holy examples; they
may teach us meekness under hard treatments of men, patience
under the hand of God; submission to poverty; improvement
of trials and afflictions; which are mercies of so great value, that
we cannot expect any obligations equivalent from the richest.</p>
            <p>2. But especially we owe our <hi>supplications, prayers, intercessions
and thanksgivings, for Kings and all that are in authority under them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If <hi>self</hi> were rightly understood, this duty would be the easiest
task that ever was imposed upon us; for in praying for them, we
pray for the Nation, and so for our selves: the prosperity and
success of the King, is the prosperity of the whole Kingdom;
and as the Philosopher curst the man, whoever he was, that first
divided <hi>bonum, utile &amp; honestum;</hi> that which is <hi>profitable,</hi> from that
which is <hi>just and righteous:</hi> So may they be lookt upon as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Plagues of a Nation, who first divided the interest of the
Prince from that of his People; or first taught the People to set
up an interest distinct and separate from that of their Prince.</p>
            <p>(3.) The Reasons which support so weighty a duty are next to be
attended to; and they are two. The first is drawn from our clear
<hi>duty,</hi> the second from our unquestionable <hi>interest;</hi> and consider
the cause we have to acknowledge the goodness of God, who has
so strongly united both these, that we can never fail in the former,
but we must be false to the latter.</p>
            <p>1. The former Reason is drawn from the conscience of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Command given forth by his Apostle, <hi>l exhort;</hi> under the
authority of which Praecept the highest spirit must bow, the stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornest
bend: This answers all objections, silences all disputes,
satisfies all scruples. This Text is not <hi>constitutive</hi> of a new duty,
but <hi>declarative</hi> of an old obligation which from the beginning lay
upon the Conscience; this was not a duty now newly <hi>created,</hi> but
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44573:4"/>
newly <hi>exemplified;</hi> he does not now make a new bond, but ties it
closer that Conscience may feel its bonds; when Conscience
slumbers it must be awakened; and when a Notion is much worn
off, it must be refresht and toucht up again to the Original.</p>
            <p>2. The other Reason is drawn from our own interest and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
<hi>that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and
honesty.</hi> Which Reason has two branches.</p>
            <p>1. Our <hi>civil interest</hi> will lie much in't; <hi>that we may lead a quiet
and peaceable life.</hi> 'Tis but a languishing dying comfort we can take
in any thing we call ours, if we cannot possess it in Peace: <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
is the sweetness of <hi>Propriety;</hi> whatever be the furniture of our
table, the sawce of every morsel is peace and quietness. We look
upon all our good things with a pitiful eye, when we think they
may be ours but for this moment. The Sword of a foreign Enemy,
the Rapine of some petty Tyrant may sweep away what we have
in an hour.</p>
            <p>2. Our <hi>Religious interest</hi> is greatly concern'd in this duty, that
we <hi>may lead a life in all godliness and honesty.</hi> Reason then we have to
pray, and give thanks for our Rulers, that we may, and do lead
such a life, in outward peace, with a freedom to worship our God
according to his will reveal'd to us in his holy word.</p>
            <p>From the words thus open'd, many observations offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
I must content my self, and I hope you, with this one
clear from the Text, and pertinent to the present occasion.</p>
            <p>Doctrine. <hi>A religious and Loyal People can never want just cause to
praise, and give thanks to God for their Kings and Governours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If they be bad, yet we have reason to pray God would mend
them, and to praise God too, that they are no worse? that if they
be not such as are eligible, yet that they are such as are tolerable.
If they be good and gracious, then the case is plain; to pray he
will confirm them; and to give thanks that we who have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
merit, nor meetness for so great a favour, yet are blessed
with it.</p>
            <p>If God shall exalt the Nation, we have cause enough to pray,
that he would not cast us down; if he shall lay us low, to bless
his name that we are laid no lower.</p>
            <p>If God shall prosper our King with success, we have reason still
to fear and pray, that our turning those successes into wantonnes,
may not provoke God to turn his hand against us; if he shall hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
us with adverse providences, yet will there remain matter
of thanksgiving that we are not consumed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:44573:5"/>
We can never be so low but the everlasting arms are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
us; our enemies are never so high but the Almighty arm of
God is above them. Let the storms rise and roar, and rage, our
God fits above them. There's matter of praise: if it be a dead
calm, still we have reason to pray, that storms may not surprize us.</p>
            <p>The Psalmist has drawn the circumference of our rejoycing
and our fears with great exactness, <hi>Psal. 2. 11. Rejoyce</hi> with <hi>trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</hi>
Never such cause of <hi>rejoycing,</hi> but it suggests matter of trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling;
never such cause of <hi>fears,</hi> but it affords matter for hope,
place for faith, and room for thanksgiving to God, that we are not
sunk in utter despair.</p>
            <p>The Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 30. teaches us the due measure of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
<hi>To weep as tho we wept not;</hi> and the true bounds of rejoycing
too, <hi>To rejoice as if we rejoiced not;</hi> The former, because God can

               </gap>use rejoycing, and mingle our cup of consolation
with the waters of bitter affliction; when God exalts us, we are
cautioned not to exalt our selves, but our God; when he abases
us he would have us keep our hearts low, but to lift the eye of
our faith on high. And this will be the true mean under the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
dispensations of providence, when God humbles us to be
humbled, when he chastises us to be chastifed, but not sink in

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>pondency; when he lifts us up, then to be lifted in praises.</p>
            <p>The Apostle <hi>James, ch.</hi> 5. 15. instructs us, that <hi>Prayer</hi> is the
proper duty for <hi>a day of affliction;</hi> that praise is the suitable duty for
prosperity; but yet s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, that prayer is never out of season in our
highest, not praise improper in our lowest condition.</p>
            <p>In the managing this observation, I will endeavour 1. Briefly
to confirm it. 2. Then largely to apply it.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>I. For Confirmation.</head>
               <p>And for that I shall only offer three consideratious.</p>
               <p>1. Reason. The wise God has put all things in this lower
world in a state of mixture; none so evil, but has a mixture of
good to allay the evil; none so good, but has a mixture of evil to
dilute the goodness of it. God oftentimes writes bitter things
against a person, against a people, but withal sends some
Mercy to sweeten it; at other times he indulges us pleasant mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
but withal provides a mixture of crosses, that we may not
surseit upon the luscious Mercies.</p>
               <p>And as the good is distinguisht from the evil, tho not separated;
so the evil is mingled with the good, but not confused; good is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44573:5"/>
good still, tho it receives a tincture of evil; and evil is evil still,
tho it receives a dash of goodness. Now as mercy and judgment,
sorrow and joy, are as it were blended together into one mass,
so will our praises and prayers have their proper employments in
both. If God sets the good against the evil, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7. 14, there's
matter for prayer that God would <hi>turn the evil unto good, Gen.</hi> 50.
20. and matter for praise too, that God has promised it shall <hi>work
for good,</hi> Rom 8. 28. And <hi>first</hi> let us for the clearing of this point
look back into former ages, especially into the <hi>Jewish</hi> state.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 16, 17. we read that <hi>Asa removed his Mother from
being Queen, because she had made an Idol in a Grove.</hi> To depose an
Idolatress was then it seems one good step towards a happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;
<hi>And Asa cut down her Idol, and stamp it and burnt it, by
the brook Kidron.</hi> What rejoycing was there in <hi>Judah</hi> that the
work of Reformation went on so pleasantly? What cause of
thanksgiving to God, that he had inspired the King with such a
zeal for the true worship of God against Idolatry? But yet 16. 17.
<hi>The high places were not taken away out of Israel.</hi> There's matter of
lamentation, that the work advanc'd no further; and of prayer
too, that God would raise such a spirit as might pluck them down
also: <hi>Nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.</hi> The most
perfect heart of the most zealous Prince cannot always go through
to a perfect Reformation. But do we not read, that this good
King <hi>Asa, ch.</hi> 14. v. 5. <hi>Took away out of all the Cities of Judah, the
high places and the images.</hi> True! out of <hi>Judah,</hi> but not out of
<hi>Israel!</hi> Where lay the reason of the Difference? In <hi>Judah</hi> he had
an haereditary right, had better hold on the spirits of the people;
there was a sweet harmony between the King and the People,
there he might venture farther in Reformation. In <hi>Israel</hi> he had
but an acquired right by Conquest; the People were averse to a
through Reformation, there he must use caution and prudence:
However the Idols were broken down, there's matter of rejoycing
and praise; the high places are not removed, there's matter of
sorrow and prayer.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the King may be inclin'd to reform, and a restli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
People may binder; there give thanks to God for a well inclined
King, and pray that he would cure the Peoples bigotry: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a King may incline to Idolatry, and the People adhere to
the true Religion; give thanks for a fixed people, and pray for
an averse Prince.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let us but look into our own hearts, and there we
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44573:6"/>
shall find too great a mixture; there we shall meet with grace
and nature, heaven and earth, flesh and spirit in continual combat,
Gal. 5. 17. <hi>The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the
flesh, and these are contrary the one to the other, so that ye cannot do the
things that ye would.</hi> The flesh has its interest, motions, and
actings; the spirit opposes it, it cannot do the evil it would: the
spirit breathes, moves, works towards God; the flesh opposes it,
so that it cannot do the good it would. <hi>The Law of the mind</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
the serving, glorifying of God; <hi>the Law of the members</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
and wars against it; the law of the members leads to bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
under sin, the law of the mind resists it. What reason of
strong cries and prayers, that we may be <hi>delivered from this body of
death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Rom. 7. 24. What cause of thanksgiving, that Christ <hi>gives
us the victory,</hi> that with our minds we serve the law of God, <hi>v.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>In a word, we are furnisht with matter of thanksgiving that we
are on this side Hell, and yet have mighty reasons for prayer too
because we are on this side Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let's view our case at home, we shall find a mixture
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>here of good and evil, affording us matter of sorrow and joy,
and hence of prayer and praise. God has given our King some
good success abroad, let us give thanks for that; but our victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are purchased with the lives, the blood of many of our fellow
Subjects, there's matter of mourning to cool the joy of our suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses;
and still for further prayer, that the issue of this bloody
war may be a happy, just and honourable peace: We have large
matter of thanksgiving, that God by our King has given a check
to the Arms of that Monarch who had swallow'd up so many
Countries, and threatned the rest; but still cause of servent prayer,
that God would yet use his Majesty as an instrument, in the hand
of his wise and gracious Counsels, to reduce <hi>the man of the earth</hi>
to reason, that he may no more triumph.</p>
               <p>Again, we have abundant reason to give thanks for our King,
that under his auspicious Reign we may be as holy as we will;
yet have we reasons for further prayer, that men may not be as
wicked as they will, and as their own naughty hearts, and the
Tempter would prompt them to be.</p>
               <p>Such then being the posture of all humane affairs, there is a dark
and bright side of the same cloud; they are checquer'd with black
and white throughout, that as they administer matter of joy and
sorrow, trouble and comfort, and nothing is sincere and without
mixture, so they bespeak of us both prayer and praise.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:44573:6"/>
In Hell, the wrath of God is poured out without mixture,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 10. without mixture either of mercy from God, or hope
in them. In Heaven, the love of God is given out without mixture,
either of anger in God, or fear in the blessed; but we in this mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
state have our hopes and fears, our tears and rejoycings, which
call for praise in our most depressed, and prayer in our most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
condition.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Reason.</hi> Is drawn from the natural and necessary connexion
between these two duties, of Prayer and Thanksgiving: they are
twins of the same womb, they are born, they breathe, they smile
or weep, live or die together.</p>
               <p>The renewed nature, the new heart is but one, the actings
which proceed from thence are various; the branches are many,
they are all one in the root; the streams various, the spring but
one: As the Capillary Arteries are innumerable in the extreme
parts, yet are all one in the heart; as the lines which reach the
circumference are numerous, yet all meet in the center; so are
the actings of grace various and multiform, as they are diversified
by various objects, as drawn out by different occasions, yet they
agree, and are uniform in the habit. Prayer and praise are exerted
upon various reasons, but it's the same holy nature which supplies
and furnishes out these holy operations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6. In every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving,
let your requests be made known to God.</p>
               <p>The same spirit that enables us to pray, assists us also to praise
our God; the answers of Prayer immediately engage the soul to
return our humble thanks, that he has heard the voice of our
supplications: Those very praises suggest matter of prayer again,
that he would graciously pardon the defects of our prayer, and
overlook the errors of our praises, and yet still to bless his Name
that notwithstanding these failures or excesses, he hath regarded
with acceptation both our prayers and praises.</p>
               <p>Would we reserve and adjourn all our thanksgivings for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
why, here's abundant matter to fill up, and furnish out
praises on this side the throne! or do we reserve our Prayers for
the extremity of distresses? there's occasion for them in the
height of our triumphs.</p>
               <p>The state of glory excludes prayers: because the Spirits of just
men made perfect are put into the actual possession of whatever
they could want, or can possibly desire, without fear of losing it:
The state of eternal wrath excludes prayer too, because there's
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44573:7"/>
no hope lest in that bottom of despair to kindle a spark of desire
to meliorate that evil condition: But our present state admits
both hope, and desire, and fear too; now whiles we can hope
for promised good, or have reason to fear impending evil, we
have proper occasion for prayer; and while we can pray, we
have just cause of praise, that God is not out of the reach of our
Prayer, nor we out of the reach of his Mercy. Psal. 66. 19, 20.
<hi>Verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of my supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer,</hi> (from him)
<hi>nor his mercy from me;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us once more consult the Apostle; 1 Thes. 5. 16, 17, 18.
<hi>Rejoice evermore: Pray without ceasing. In every thing give thanks.</hi> At
first view we may imagine the Apostle puts us upon either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
or impracticable, or contradictory services: <hi>Rejoice ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more!</hi>
As if we had no cause of sorrow, nor any thing further to
ask; and yet <hi>Pray without ceasing!</hi> as if we had no place for, or
cause of thanksgiving: <hi>Pray,</hi> as if you had nothing; and yet
<hi>Praise,</hi> as if you possessed all things: And <hi>in every thing give thanks.</hi>
If the case be good, bless God directly and formally, if evil, yet
bless him that it's no worse.</p>
               <p>The attributes of God appear to us, and we conceive of them
that they really are various; and accordingly, we engage our souls
in a various consideration of them, and a different demeanour of
soul towards them. We conceive of him as good, and therefore
love him; as faithful and true, and therefore believe him, and in
him, trust to him, and depend upon him; as bountiful and rich
in mercy towards us, and therefore return our thanks unto him:
And yet these attributes are but one in God, or rather they are
that one God. Thus the graces which a Believer does act and
exercise are distinguisht, tho not divided; the soul loves, fears,
and believes, and yet'tis but one soul, one new creature that puts
forth these various operations.</p>
               <p>If we bring all this to the present subject of which we treat,
and the solemn occasion on which we meet, it will stand thus.
We are here as a people, and I hope really a people that would
recognize the divine favours to our King, to us all in him; yet
prayer must not be excluded from the present service: that God
would never be weary of doing good to him, or to us in him;
that God would finish the work that <hi>he</hi> has begun, and strengthen
the King to finish the work which <hi>he</hi> has begun; Thus to bless
our God for the ground we get; and as we gain to pray that we
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44573:7"/>
may get more, till this troublesome War shall terminate in a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Peace; that so Peace being settled abroad, we may lead a
quiet and peaceable life at home, in all godliness and honesty.</p>
               <p>III <hi>Reason.</hi> The Truth may be confirmed from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
and alternations of the divine providence; which, as it were, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting
to sport it self with humane affairs, creates those perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
changes in them, which will employ our praises as well as
our prayers.</p>
               <p>What we see in the successions of night and day, what we feel
of changes in our vile and frail bodies. as to health and sickness,
that may we expect in the great political Bodies and the affairs of
Empires.</p>
               <p>The Psalmist has made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Record of it, <hi>Psal. 102. 10. Thou hast
listed me up,</hi> (there's matter of thanksgiving) <hi>and thou hast cast me
down.</hi> (There's matter of debasement and prayer.)</p>
               <p>That which we are to keep in our eye when God exalts us, is
a holy fear, lest we exalting our selves, God should throw us
down; and that which we should keep upon our hearts when
God abases us, is, that we abasing our selves, God may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to lift us up</p>
               <p>A deplorable instance of the impotency of humane nature, to
bear any thing with a <hi>due temper</hi> and moderation, is that of <hi>Vzzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi>
2 Chron. 26. 15. <hi>He was marvellously helped until he was strong:
But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction</hi> So
difficult it is to maintain the equipoise, and not to reel and stagger
from one extreme to another: A little air swells a bubble, and a
little more breaks it.</p>
               <p>And this <hi>David</hi> found, Psal. 30. 6. <hi>In my prosperity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, I shall
never be moved, thou Lord by they favour hast made my mountain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> stand
strong.</hi> Wherein we may observe, 1. His confidence, that his
mountain should never be moved, or however not removed,</p>
               <p>2. That this confidence seems to be well founded, upon the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of God, wherein then lay the evil of his confidence? That
he did not duly consider the instability of all things, but presumed
that his state was unmovable. 3. That God, to humble his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
hides his face, and then his confidence is shaken.</p>
               <p>But thus do the affairs of Kingdoms and Commonwealths run
in a circle; prosperity awakens pride, pride provokes God to
forsake us, and a people forsaken are upon the brink of destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<hi>Let therefore him that stands take heed lest he fall;</hi> and let him that
falls, repent and pray that God would raise him up.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:44573:8"/>
It was a deep sense of the perpetual rotations of Providence
that moved that great <hi>Saxon</hi> King, whenever God smiled upon
his Arms with Victory, to prepare for adverse events; and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he lost the day, to encourage and strengthen himself with
the hopes of better success.
<q>
                     <l>Si modo victor erat, ad crastina bella timebat:</l>
                     <l>Si modo victus erat, ad crastina bella parabat.</l>
                  </q>
All this leads to our Duty: God has favour'd us with good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
this Campaign, praise his Name, but persume not; he can
send us a rebuke in a moment: If so, he not dejected, but pray,
for he has in infinite wisdom attempered all affairs, that prayer and
praise shall have their turns, as prosperity and adversity walk their
rounds; till prayer be swallowed up of eternal praises to them
that fear the Lord, and the presumptuous hopes of impenitent
sinners be drowned in eternal despair.</p>
               <p>Having now briefly confirmed the truth as was promised, I
must more largely improve it, in</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>II. The Application.</head>
               <p>We have heard, that a Religious People can never want just
reasons to pray to, and praise God for Kings and all that are in
Authority. Hearken then to the Apostles <hi>Exhortation:</hi> He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts,
and 'tis in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ that he does
so; he exhorts, that this be done <hi>first of all,</hi> that it may have a
precedency of all our little private interests; and that we postpone
not so important a duty to the adjusting of lesser matters.</p>
               <p>Would we give our selves leave and leisure to think, what a sad
generation of Emperors they were, for whom the Apostle enjoyns
the Primitive Christians to pray and give thanks; it would shame
our consciences and make us blush, that they could pray better,
and praise God more, for <hi>a Tiberius, a Claudius, a Caligula, a Nero,</hi>
than we for a Prince so tender of his Subjects, so far from the
sanguinary spirit of persecution, which filled all the veins, and the
whole mass of blood of those Plagues of the World, those Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Men, the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors; such, as 'tis a wonder the
earth could bear, or the patience of God endure such Wretches to
tyrannize over so vast numbers of rational creatures, as the Empire
did contain: I can look upon them under no other notion, than
the Ministers of divine wrath to plague a generation of men, who
had not only shut, but put out their eyes, that neither natural nor
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44573:8"/>
gospel light might shine into them; for such as these, better men
had been much too good; and much worse, if possible, not too
bad to avenge the affronted Deity upon their Immoralities. But
yet as to the Christians, who were converted out of them, and
dwelt among them, and were a part of them, they were not so
bad, but faith could pick up something for which to bless God;
and the worse they were, the more need still to ply the throne
with humble prayer either to make them better, or to keep them
from being worse.</p>
               <p>I would be understood to speak this of those that were Heathens.
For if any in after times should be found professing the Christian
Religion, and wearing the Heathen, or perhaps the Atheist un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that disguise; if when a flattering juncture should tempt him,
he should throw off the viz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the greatest indication of the unpardonable sin; the Apostle
would not, durst not say, that they should pray for such a one,

               <p>We <hi>Christians</hi> (says he) lifting up our eyes to Heaven, with
our hands stretcht out, to shew that we are innocent; with our
heads uncovered, to shew we are not ashamed; and without a
Moniror because we pray from our very heart, do beseech God
for all Emperors, that he would grant them a long life, a secure
government, a safe house, valiant armies, a faithful Senate, a
reformed people, a quiet world, and whatever else either as men,
or Emperors they can pray for themselves.</p>
               <p>Compare now the matter of right, whom the Apostle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
the Primitive Christians to pray for; and the matter of
fact, whom the Primitive Christians did pray for, and we shall
be convinced, that the best will need our Prayers, and the worst
may challenge our Thanksgivings to God, that he has kept his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44573:9"/>
poor Church alive, and in being under them. As the skill of the
Pilot is more magnified, that he steers the Vessel steady in a storm
so is the power, wisdom, and faithfulness of Christ more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that he could secure his Church under such barbarous Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants.</p>
               <p>How utterly inexcusable then are we, who being posited under
more favourable circumstances, instead of praising God for gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Princes, are murmuring at them upon any little trip, or wry
step that they make or take, and perhaps are first creating
causes to murmur at, and then justifying our murmurings by those
imaginary causes; who instead of praising God for them, are
cursing them, and that not in the Bed-chamber, but the open
streets; being uneasie under their Scepters, and rendring them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easy
upon the Throne; and instead of strengthning their hands
against the common enemy, are weakening them, either to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
their Enemies, or protect their Loyal Subjects.</p>
               <p>I would willingly hope, that there are not many of this bran
and leaven amongst us, considerable either for numbers, for
power, or interest; especially since such vast throngs of them have
of late been converted; converted I say, to their own secular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
perhaps to the Kings; tho whether really converted to
God, their own inconsistent conversations give us some cause to
doubt. I speak of those Secular and State-converts, of whom his
Majesties Victories in <hi>Ireland</hi> converted thousands, his late Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
in <hi>Flanders</hi> ten thousands; and <hi>Non-jurors</hi> are converted to

                  </gap>
when we are raised and enlarged in our Praises, yet
we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> not want cause to lie low at the footstool, and look up
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44573:9"/>
to the throne in most earnest supplications upon their account.</p>
               <p>Let us then narrowly enquire what matter of Prayer Providence
has afforded us, to offer up for our King, and all that are in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p>§ 1. The first thing that recommends itself to us, is, that God
will, yet more abundantly, pour upon our King the spirit of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
that he may so govern the people, whom God, and
their own choice, have committed to his charge; that he may
give his account with joy. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1. 7. God gave <hi>Solomon</hi> his
Option, <hi>Ask what I shall give thee!</hi> A large Charter! And the
same God that gave him his choice, gave him wisdom to chuse,
Thus he answers, <hi>v. 10. Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I
may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
which is so great?</hi> In which choice he discovered, that he was
already possessed of much of that wisdom that he askt of God:
For 1. It was a wise consideration, that he lookt upon the people
to be the Lords people; more the Lords than his. He durst not
therefore arrogate any such propriety in them, or such dominion
over them, as might prejudice Gods title to them, or disseize God
of his Soveraignty over them. <hi>It is thy People.</hi> 2. It was a wise
thought, that a great people are better governed by wisdom and
prudence than force: A principle, which could he have insused
into the thick skull of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> he had saved him the ten Tribes,
which his own rash folly rent from him. 3. He was wise, that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
that it must be the wisdom that comes from above, that
is pure, and of an aetherial temper, like the fire that came down
upon the Altar, that would prove the true wisdom to rule Gods
people: when all conclusions have been tried, all experiments
made, yet it will be found that Piety is the best Policy.</p>
               <p>Now this Prayer of <hi>Solomon</hi> was so acceptable to God, that he
gives him both that he asked, and that he asked not, <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this was in thy heart; and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or
honour, nor the lives of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life, but
hast asked knowledge for thy self, that thou mayest judge my people over
whom I have made the King; wisdom and knowledge is granted thee, and
I will give thee riches, wealth, and honour,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>1. Let us therefore earnestly pray, that God would grant to our
King, and in their proportion to all his Ministers, a large measure
of the <hi>Fear of the Lord,</hi> that it may be the foundation of all his
Counsels, all his Administrations, all his Undertakings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:44573:10"/>
                  <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> both agreed in this maxim, <hi>Psal.</hi> 111. 10.
Prov. 9. 10. That <hi>the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom:</hi> And
tho <hi>David</hi> in some few instances had departed from his own
avowed Rule, yet when he came to die, and look death in the
face, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

great trust, with <hi>the spirit of wisdom, and with a quick understanding
in the fear of the Lord,</hi> Isa. 11. 2, 3.</p>
               <p>And not only is this qualification necessary for our King, but
for all that are in Authori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y: This was the reason of that excellent
advice given by <hi>Jethro</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> Exod. 18. 21. <hi>Provide out of all the
people able men; such as fear God,</hi> men of truth, <hi>hating covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Let us further pray that God would endue our King and his
Ministers, <hi>with the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of
counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge, that they may not judge by the
sight of their eyes nor reprove by the hearing of the ears:</hi> which, as it
was promis'd and given to our blessed Saviour, <hi>Isa.</hi> 11. 2. and
<hi>that without measure, Joh.</hi> 3. 34. So has he <hi>the residue of the Spirit</hi>
to dispence to all those whom he has placed in publick stations,
that they may answer the ends of government: Then may we
prognosticate and promise to our selves happy days, and our
selves to be a happy people; when all that are in Authority,
shall not hearken to the insinuations of Sycophants, nor lend an
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ar to false Accusers, nor listen to the whispers of offered Bribes to

                  </gap>gment, and to blind their eyes, but shall administer
impartial justice; consider the cause, and not respect persons;
when Justice shall run down like a stream, and Righteousness like
a mighty flood; when the oppressed shall berelieved, the Orphan
and the fatherless vindicated.</p>
               <p>Nor do we want matter of Thanksgiving upon this account;
when we seriously consider how the Courts of Judicature are filled
with persons of great Learning and Knowledge in the Laws of
the Land, and above all with men of great Integrity in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration;
such as fear not the faces of the mighty, such as no
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44573:10"/>
amade of one, that without any temptation, but of his
covetous heart; dared to receive a Bribe, under the colour of a
Gratuity, to betray his trust, and pervert justice and judgment in
the Fountain.</p>
               <p>§ 2. It will be proper matter for our Prayers too, that God
would single out and bestow upon our King, wise and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Counsellors, such as stood before <hi>Solomon;</hi> not the green heads,
and unexperienced rash young men, that soothed up <hi>Rehoboam</hi> to
his own ruine.</p>
               <p>And as we have matter for Prayer, so for Thanksgiving too,
that God has blessed the King with wise Senators, who consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the present necessities under which his Majesty now is, ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
supported him with great indeed, bat absolutely necessary Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies:
They judged in their great wisdoms, that it was better to
breathe a vein, than to cut off the head; to prune the tree, and
lop off some useful b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>anches, than to have it cut up by the roots:
That it's better we should complain once than always. It was
wisely considered, that it was more eligible at any rates to keep
the War at a distance in foreign parts, than by unseasonable spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to invite it to our own doors, nay into our own bowels.
The little finger of a foreign Enemy invading, had been heavier
than the loyns of our Representatives.</p>
               <p>And let us heartily and chearfully praise our God, that our
cost has not been in vain; nor let us ever grudge, that something
of the lading is thrown over-board to save the Vessel, in which
all our most precious concerns civil and religious are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked.</p>
               <p>§ 3. Let us again send up our most earnest supplications, that
God would preserve the life of his Majesty: It was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

our security at home; when <hi>Joshua</hi> was engaged against <hi>Amalek</hi>
in the field, <hi>Moses</hi> with <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> were striving with God
in the Mount; well knowing the ready way to prevail over the
enemy in battle, is first to prevail with God in prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let us therefore repeat our prayers;</hi> That God would compass him
him with his favour as with a sheild, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5. 12. That God would bind
up his soul in the bundle of life with the Lord his God, but the souls of his
enemies he would sling out, as from the middle of a sling, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.
29.</p>
               <p>And in this particular how mercifully has God prevented our
prayers? <hi>Before we called God has answered us; and while we were yet
speaking God did hear,</hi> Isa. 65. 24.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore convert this great mercy into Thanksgiving,
and that Thanksgiving into Prayer, that both may run in a
perpetual circle which knows no beginning, and knows no
end.</p>
               <p>§ 4. We have great cause to pray, that God would bless our
King with a loyal, quiet people, disposed to obedience. The same
power <hi>that stills the noise of the Sea, must also still the tumult of the
People,</hi> Psal. 85. 7. And the Psalmist, who understood this secret
of government with an admiring heart, blessed God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 144. 1,
2. not only that he had <hi>taught his hands to war and his fingers to fight,</hi>
but that he <hi>subdued his People under him.</hi> The waters would be
always smooth, if the unruly winds did not ruffle them into
billows: And the multitude love their ease so well, that they
would enjoy the sweets of peace with contentment, did not some
politick <hi>Achitophels</hi> ferment the humour, and then influence them
to disorders; first throw in a spark of discontent, and then blow
it up into flames of Mutinies and Rebellions. An evidence that
government is of God, who composes the minds of so many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
to a calm submission and willing obedience to one man.</p>
               <p>Let it be here remembred, that God has given our King a
people, who tho they may sometimes be practised upon to run
into uproars, yet Loyalty is so inlaid in their tempers, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealed
to their souls, that the secret enemies of our King and
Peace could never yet make their earnings out of them: They
are like the West Wind, that for a while may be troublesome, but
commonly goes to bed at night; mutable indeed like the Moon,
yet as they know the time of rising, yet they know their going
down. Those commotions, which in some popular States would
overturn, have amongst us hardly shaken the Government; and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44573:11"/>
what has been elsewhere an Earthquake, we have scarcely felt so
much as a Trembling.</p>
               <p>Nay, we have great cause to joyn our Thanksgiving with our
Prayer, that he has converted our danger into our security; that
he has made the people not the terror of the governmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, but of
its enemies: And what was once the preservation of <hi>Christ,</hi> is
now of the King; some ill men have an ill and envious eye upon
the Throne, but <hi>they fear the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 5. Let us continue our Prayers, that the Reign of his Majesty
may not be famous to after ages by any notable judgment; that
no devouring fires, desolating pestilence, bloody mass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cres, ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
earthquakes, or inundation, may signalize his government to
posterity.</p>
               <p>It was a Speech becoming the Monster <hi>Caligula,</hi> who heavily
complained of the unhappiness of his Reign, that it was not
marked with any notable calamities; as if a greater Plague could
have befallen the Empire than himself.</p>
               <p>We have had some of our late Reigns that have fallen under
another character; the Massacre in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Civil Wars in
<hi>England,</hi> the dreadful Fire of <hi>London,</hi> and the horrid Plague that
ushered it, will secure them against an inglorious Record in our
Chronicles for ever.</p>
               <p>But let us bless that merciful Providence, that has hitherto
preserved the present government from being known in History
by such tokens of divine wrath and vengeance; and again pray,
that a firm peace, sanctified plenty, prosperous trade, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
prosperity, may be the glory of it; and that the black brand
of universal debauchery, which stigmatized the former age, may
be worn out in this, by a blessed Reformation.</p>
               <p>§ 6. Let us associate our Prayers, that the God of Peace, who
makes men to be of one mind in one house, would continue,
and encrease that good understanding that has hitherto been
between the King and his People; and let not evil men be able
to foment jealousies between them, to weaken our hands at
home, that our enemies may have the easier work to destroy us
abroad:</p>
               <p>There are a sort of wretched tools, that are always whispering
in the ears of Princes, that the Peoples Privileges and Franchises
will undermine and blow up the Royal Prerogative; and then
fly-blowing the Peoples Heads, that Prerogative will eat up
the Peoples Liberties and Properties. Now this being a tender
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44573:12"/>
point, wherein each is infinitely jealous, produces a continual
parrying, and fencing, and counterworking between them:
for where the Sea is eating and working into the shore, the
maritime People will be raising Mounds and Piles not only
to secure themselves that they lose no more, but by way of
Reprisal, encroaching upon the Main for what they have
lost.</p>
               <p>But let all that wish well to the King and his People pray,
and add all just endeavours to their Prayers, that no perverse
spirit may mix it self with their respective interests, no jealousies
creep into their counsels, but that they may mutually conspire for
the publick welfare.</p>
               <p>I have read of the meeting of two poor men, the one blind,
the other lame; the <hi>blind</hi> man had good <hi>limbs,</hi> the <hi>lame</hi> had good
<hi>eyes.</hi> It was mutually agreed that the blind man should carry the
lame upon his shoulders; and thus the lame man was eyes to the
blind, the blind was limbs to the lame. I'll venture to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
it: The people have strength, but they want conduct; our
governours have conduct, but they want the peoples strength:
Be it agreed, that we lend the King all our power, and that he
govern us with his wisdom and skill.</p>
               <q>Acceptis oculis, praebuit Ille pedes.</q>
               <p>Surely we have great reason to bless our God upon this head;
that God has graciously preserved a mutual confidence between
the King and his people; that they who have sought occasions
for our disturbance upon this subject, have found none; that
wicked men have been unsuccessful in their insinuations; that the
tares they have sown have yielded 'em no harvest.</p>
               <p>§ 7. Let us yet pray and not faint, and pour out our souls
in supplications to the Almighty, the Lord of Hosts, the God
of Battel, that his Majesties forces by Sea and Land may be
crowned with glorious success; that he may at length <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

to Reason that mighty <hi>Nimrod,</hi> who has taught us what we may
expect from his prevailing Arms, by the treatment he has given
to his own too Loyal Subjects. That Monarch is of the nat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

If then his own temper will not restrain him, let God send out a

               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:44573:12"/>
Let us therefore pray, that the end of this bloody and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
War may be an honourable and just Peace; in which the
Interest of the Allies may be secured, the Interest of our own
Nation in Trade recovered, the Dominion of the seas vindicated:
but God deliver us from a Peace patcht up of plausible expedients;
palliated with fair pretences, to cover the enemies secret pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
to violate it, when he has filled his empty Coffers; when
he has recruited his exhausted strength by taking breath, to build
his Alliances upon the ruines of the dissolved Confederacy;
which like an old Ulcer ill healed, and skin'd over, waits only a
flattering juncture to break out again, with more threatning
symptomes; But let our Prayer and Peace be that of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi>
Isa. 39. 8. <hi>God is the word of the Lord, for he said, there shall be peace
and truth in my days.</hi> Nor do we want matter of thanksgiving for
the successful and hopeful issue of this Summers Campaign:
Wherein the late boasted invincible Prince is proved to be
conquerable; and as we hope, so we pray, that this may be but
an earnest of what God will further do for a Repenting, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming,
Praying and Thankful People.</p>
               <p>§ 8. Lastly, Let us keep up our Prayers in vigor, that God
will make our King a glorious instrument in the hand of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
power to suppress that daring wickedness, that impudent
profaneness, which the Enemy sowed, water'd, and gave in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
to, in the late Reigns of unhappy memory: That, at
least, iniquity may stop its mouth, and hide its deformed face,
that deeds of darkness may not defie the Sun; that if men will
sin, they may however creep into those corners, whither they had
once driven much of Religion.</p>
               <p>We must confess and lament that we have sins enow in the
Armies to rout them without an Enemy; Sins enow in the Fleets
to sink them without a Tempest, and sins enow on shoar to
make us like to <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha;</hi> but the more need we
have to beseech heaven that he would not deal with us after our
sins, nor reward us according to our iniquities: And that he
would put upon our King the Honour of the famous <hi>Hercules,</hi>
who cleansed the <hi>Augaean</hi> Stables, with turning the stream of
the River through it; a labour justly numbred amongst the
twelve.</p>
               <p>We look upon his Majesty as bearing a double Sword, that
of <hi>War,</hi> and that of <hi>Justice;</hi> we pray that he may bear neither in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44573:13"/>
vain: We have seen how wisely and strongly he has wielded
the former; we now pray for a Peace, that he may have a
Theatre whereon to wield the other: And when God shall
command him to sheath that of War, he will invite him to
draw the other: To defend the innocent, to plead the cause
of the Orphan and Widow; and to punish those wretches
whose effrontery has dared both the Sword of God and the
King.</p>
               <p>We are ready to wonder what temptations these vile ones can
pretend to their abominations: The cheap swearer sells his soul
for nothing: The blasphemer makes bold to defile the sacred
na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

pleasure that perishes in the using.</p>
               <p>And here we would gladly find more matter of thanksgiving,
for what our King, and those in authority under him, have done
to vindicate the name of God against these Agressors: We
thankfully own that some Remedies have been prescribed and
applied, but slight medicines do but i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

good Laws we have, and some Proclamations for their execution,
against the Profanation of the Lords day, against Cursing and
Swearing; but seeing execution is the life of the Law, without
which the Law is but a dead Letter; and that there are so few
men of Courage, Zealous for the glory of God, and the repute
of our holy Religion, to give life to those Laws by an impartial
execution; there is work still for earnest Prayer, that God
would take the work into his own hand, and effect that by the
<hi>Sword of his Mouth,</hi> which the <hi>Mouth of the Sword</hi> cannot, or they
that manage it will not.</p>
               <p>Forget we not however to return our humble thanks to God,
who has stirred up some from the Press and Pulpit to bear their
testimony against the Iniquity of the day; and for those zealous
Magistrates, especially in the City of <hi>London,</hi> who have dared
to punish, where any have dared to offend, and have been zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for the honour of God, against all the discouragements they
have encountred in the way of their Duty.</p>
               <p>(2.) <hi>Proceed we now to our</hi> Second Inquiry; what proper matter
for thanksgiving to God we can find on the behalf of the King, and those that
are in authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:44573:13"/>
§ 1. And first let us begin our thanks to God, that he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us such a Prince to govern us: A mercy for which we could
neither pretend merit, nor meetness: A Prince that can shew
that Title in reality, which some others had only in formality,
our own deliberate consent and free choice. I know, Succession
in the right line has made a mighty noise amongst us; but surely
ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ional creatures have their reason allotted them to know, and
chuse what's best for themselves, or let them quit their pretended
superiority above the brutes. And if there be any such thing,
the Election of the People gives the clearest <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> both
to the kind or form of government, and the person that must sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
and administer it.</p>
               <p>Deut. 17. 15 <hi>That shalt in any wise set him over thee whom the
Lord thy God shall chuse.</hi> Where we cannot but observe, 1. The
act of the People. <hi>Setting a King over them.</hi> And this 2. In
pursuance of the act of God, chusing or pointing out the person,
whom the People ought to set up.</p>
               <p>Now this manifestation of Gods choice, in either is a way
<hi>extraordinary,</hi> and thus he pointed to <hi>David,</hi> as the person
whom in due season the People were to set over themselves.
For tho God had designed the person, and anointed him by
<hi>Samuel,</hi> in token of that Designation, yet the Right of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was left entire unto them. 2 Sam. 2. 4. <hi>The men of Judah
came, and there they anointed David King over the house of Judah,</hi>
Which Title as <hi>David</hi> owned, so he asse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts, pleads, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres
to it in his controversy with the house of <hi>Saul, v.</hi> 7. The
house of <hi>Judah have anointed me King over them.</hi> And there's
no doubt but if a People wanted a King, they would thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
own the condesention of God, that he would direct them
to a fit person whom they might advance to the Throne.</p>
               <p>But in <hi>ordinary cases,</hi> when we cannot expect an immediate
Revelation to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ermine the point, we must look upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to be of the divine Designation, whom, all circumstances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
God has qualified for gove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nment in general, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted
to the genius, and temper of the Nation in particular,
over whom he is to reign: Now what could he more articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lately
the voice of God in our case than this: He was a Prince
and Protestant born, such a one the Nation gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aned for; train'd
up to War from his youth; such a one we wanted, to revive
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44573:14"/>
the Military Courage of the Nation, almost choaked with luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and riot, through the effeminacy of the two last reigns; one
whose Interest led him to espouse the betrayed Cause and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of the Land, against a haughty Prince, who had swallow'd
up a considerable part of <hi>Europe,</hi> and daily gap'd to devour the
rest: Now it being clear that we wanted a Prince, and as clear
that we wanted such a Prince, and still as clear that God offered
us such a one as we wanted, what could the Nation do in their
general Convention, but set up such a one as the Lord did
choose.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore return our thanks to our God, who graciously
offered; who disposed the hearts of the people unanimously
to accept the offer of God, and then so powerfully inclined
the Princes heart to accept our offer; tho he foresaw the Crown
of <hi>England</hi> was alternately flowred with Lillies and Crosses; and
he that would wear our Crown of Gold, must also wear one of
Thorns.</p>
               <p>But as we have cause of Praise, so have we of Prayer too.
In the grand Charter of <hi>Israel</hi> to set a King over them, there are
some special clauses to which both King and People will do well
to attend.</p>
               <p>1. That the person whom they should set over them, <hi>be one of
their Brethren,</hi> v. 15. <hi>Thou mayst not set a stranger over thee.</hi> To
this Proviso our Convention had a religious respect; judging
him that is of a <hi>strange Religion,</hi> that has espoused a <hi>foreign int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and whose heart is an Alien to the good and prosperity of the
People, and who had introduced a <hi>foreign power,</hi> to be really a
stranger, tho locally born within the King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

shall own the Cause of our Religion, the true Interest of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to be a Denizon, tho he had been born in the remotest parts
of the earth.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>We have here a Law prescribed to the</hi> King himself, <hi>v.</hi> 18.
That when he sits upon the throne of the kingdom, he (shall write him a
Copy of this Law in a Book; and it shall be with him, and he shall read
therein all the days of his life; that he may learn to fear the Lord his
God; to keep all the words of this Law—that his heart be not lifted
up above his brethren <hi>He must still remember, that as the people
have lifted him up above them, yet he is under God still.</hi>

this day; we cannot reflect upon that dreadful stroke which
astonisht three Kingdoms, but our hearts tremble at the thought,
that if the blow had been repeated in the person of his Majesty,
and our wound opened before it was well healed, we must have
bled to death.</p>
               <p>Bless we God therefore, that Providence in preserving our
King, has not preserved only three Kingdoms, but almost all
<hi>Europe.</hi> And let us mingle our Prayers with our Thanksgivings,

Prayers follow Praises in an uninterrupted succession, which that

and works of God have had such lean success upon our hearts,
and lives at home: we may well wonder that the Kings Sword
should cut so deep in the field, when the Sword of God does so

down our Arms and submit to God, how soon would our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

may turn from his just displeasure, and that we repenting of the

threatned, and we have deserved.</p>
               <p>§ 4. We have yet plenteous matter to fill up and furnish our

are not first plundered, and then fired. The enemy has not
reaped what we sowed. Our Virgins are not torn from under
the Wings of their tender Parents; our Wives from the Arms
of their beloved Husbands. How little impression has this
made upon our hearts, if a Mercy of so great imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap>nce
escapes our most serious Consideration, our highest Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.</p>
               <p>I have observed, when the issues of affairs upon the Wheel
were dubious, how impatient we were, how fretful that we
could no sooner hear the Events of Sieges, Battles; when had
we had understood our selves, we had more reason to admire
the disposal of wise Providence, that these matters were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
at such a distance, that we could be informed no sooner.
Had this War been acted upon the bloody Theater of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Country, our own eyes would have been the Expresses to
tell of the burning of Towns, our ears the Intelligencers, that
would soon have brought the tidings, that our Country was laid
waste and desolate.</p>
               <p>And now let fervent Prayers accompany our Praises, that
our base ingratitude, our sordid murmurings, may not bring
this War over Seas, to avenge the quarrel of provoked good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
upon us; we who have no more sympathized with our
Brethren and fellow Subjects, that have hazarded or sacrificed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44573:16"/>
their Lives to keep Fire and Sword at a distance from us,
may justly be taught at dearer rate, to prize that Mercy, when
God shall his for Armies of enemies to invade the Land of our
Nativity.</p>
               <p>§ 5. Proceed we to yet further cause of Thanksgiving to
God, that has made our King his Servant in delivering us from
those Twin-plagues of <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

offer to him the Twin-duties of <hi>Prayer and Praise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>May we never imitate the <hi>Israelites</hi> who cried importunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for Mercies one day, which they scornfully threw away
the next. We cannot but remember, sure I am God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members,
how we sighed, and groaned under the apprehensions
of Papal Tyranny; how we fasted, how we prayed, that God
would prevent what we feared, divert what threatned us, and
remove what we felt, with prodigal vows what we would be,
what we would do, what we would return, if God would deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and save us that one time.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Israel</hi> was in a wretched frame to praise God for

when they were Fasting, Isa. 58. 5. <hi>Is it such a Fast that I have

as I have chosen?</hi> Let us fear lest God make us keep

Gods day is an odd way of praising him. I will readily
grant,</p>
               <p>1. That Thanksgiving is a duty proper to the Lords day.
Nor can we more suitably, and seasonably fill up that holy
day, than with a thankful Commemoration of the triumphant
Resurre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               <p>2. I readily grant, that holy Joy is an individual Companion
of holy Praise, and well suited to that holy day.</p>
               <p>3. Nor can it be denied, that some sort of rejoycing, or
outward signs, expressions, and testimonies of the inward
Joy in God, and Praise unto God, are agreeable to that
day, and the duties of it; such are <hi>Psalms, and Hymns, and
spiritual Songs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Gal. 3. 16.</p>
               <p>4. And there are other lawful expressions of our joy and
rejoycing, which the usage and custom of several Nations have

Bone fires, Ringing of Bells, Fireworks, the dislo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

               <p>6. There are some expressions of Rejoycing which upon any
other day be sinful, or become so, as they are ordinarily practised;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44573:17"/>
wherein the lusts of men are apparently gratified excited, and
inflamed; and to which no Rules of Moderation were ever yet
effectually prescribed.</p>
               <p>7. And there are some which seem to be the contrivance of
the Devil to advance his Kingdom and Interest; such as drinking
of Healths: in which tho some critical Divines can divide the
sin, from the things in the notion and speculation; yet as
the custom has obtained upon ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es of profuse indulgence to
rejoycing we see that in fact, God is dishonoured, the creatures
are shamefully abused, the souls of men are brutified.</p>
               <p>Let therefore all that fear God be cautious; our Bonefires
may kindle such a fie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

God can make us ting 'em backwards. Retire we therefore to
our Families, and there bless and praise God for his great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and let us not be partakers of other mens sins, lest incensed
Justice turn our thanksgivings into mournings, and we prepare
work for days of Humiliation by our carnal, vain, and unsan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified

               <p>2. <hi>Direction.</hi> Let us well understand, and keep fixt in our eye,
the true reasons of our thanksgivings to God on the behalf of our
Kings, and all that are in Authority; and there are two great
ones mention'd.</p>
               <p>1. That we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
The former word denotes <hi>a Mind</hi> disposed to peace,
composedness, and rest; for all the world will be stormy without
us, if we be not of a calm temper within. The other denotes,
a posture and state of things secure from disturbances abroad: Bless
we therefore our God that in any degree we are, and pray that
we still more may be, <hi>Delivered out of the hands of our enemies, that
we may serve him without fear all the days of our lives,</hi> Luke 1. 74.
The less cause we have slavishly to fear men, the more reason we
have religiously to fear our God.</p>
               <p>2. That this quiet and peaceable life may be spent <hi>in all go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and honesty.</hi> The end of a just War is an honourable Peace; the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44573:18"/>
end of that Peace is Godliness. Shall we make a war with

Christ, that his fruit may be sweet to us: Let not therefore our
Peace, when ever God shall restore it, prove the Mother of
