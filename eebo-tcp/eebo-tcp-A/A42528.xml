            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It ought to be the labour of a <hi>Colledge of Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> (not of one pitifull Pretender) to advance the preservation of such a person, which if lost, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing age must faintly hope to re-example. In the
<pb facs="tcp:40510:3"/>
want therefore, or failings of <hi>Physical</hi> Counsels be your own <hi>Lessius,</hi> be to your self a <hi>Cornara,</hi> since it hath so providentially faln out, all other outward embellishments being abundantly bestowed upon you, that you need not spend any time to adorn, or trick up your self, but only to express your thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness to the gracious Opificer of so rare a piece, &amp; employ some hours (as is your practise) that your Countrey, Family, and Friends may be happy in the long possession of you. For really your own Practise (<hi>Madam</hi>) will out-do all my Precepts, your Gardens and Parks out-vie the Physick-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens; your Closet is as considerable as the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess of Kent</hi>'s with her Powder in it. At <hi>Henham-Hall</hi> (the Seat of your <hi>Noble Husbands</hi> Ancestors) what is wanting to Satiety? yet your Deer out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live the ages of their Neighbour-commoners, and their Parks too; 'tis possible to find a Stag as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as that of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s: nor is this done by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et of your Keeper, or your keeping your Deer from being your Diet, but by a successive spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your Park, not destroying it, by letting us eat <hi>Venison,</hi> but not to such excess, as if your <hi>Guests</hi> were to feed themselves into <hi>Elkes.</hi> Your Deer fall (as our <hi>Colledge-copices</hi> should do) at so many years growth, that so the succeeding scholars may have wood of their own, &amp; not expect Coals from <hi>New-castle.</hi> Your Table is <hi>Mezentian</hi> in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect; for <hi>alive</hi> Deer look in at your windows, and see their <hi>dead</hi> Brother in a Coffin. So rare is your Cookery, it makes slaughter amiable, and the
<pb facs="tcp:40510:3"/>
Heard desire to be wounded, that they may be so dress'd. I have seen your Table furnished with more Dishes then my Book hath Chapters in it, and yet the Temperance did exceed the Dishes, so that if ever Abstinence was <hi>paramount,</hi> and in its <hi>Zenith</hi> it was at <hi>Henham,</hi> where Self-deniall (so much spoke of) was truly visible, even in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Creature, and your Guests din'd <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophically,</hi> at a City Feast.
<q>This is true Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance (Madam) to refraine where there is variety of temptation to excess; to stint the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, in full view of the game of Luxury, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it is Penance, not Abstinence, and the Mind and Appetite not commanded, but a string tied about the throat, which is <hi>Cormorant sobriety,</hi> for which the Fowl wishes him hang'd that throtled him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus commended (<hi>Madam</hi>) your Diet, 'tis not with any Stratagem to get Applause to my own, which is too course for your Palate, and scarce fit for your Servants. But as you sometimes are pleased to leave the Rarities of your own Table and Caresse in a Cottage, where the Earthen Platter, the Barley Pudding, the Fool, and the plain Countrey Houswife, are both Meat and Sport, and delight and nourish beyond the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of multiplied Cookery. So let it fare (best Lady) with this slender treatment of your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, which is not a Present, but a Debt of a long Promise, and not in that kind paid that it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised. I did intend you a Grace, some Divine
<pb facs="tcp:40510:4"/>
Poems, but present you with all manner of Diet, for fear being without Grace, it might be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed all of Oysters, or Melons. The Book is a <hi>Hieroglyphick salt,</hi> not that with the <hi>head of Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> on it, which is melancholy, or a <hi>Charing-cross</hi>-trencher salt, which is impious; but this is a <hi>pillar of Salt,</hi> or rather of Temperance, which is healthful (and at least in wish) Festivous, the Motto as it may be translated,

                  <l>To profit, and delight.</l>

            <p>THis Book, entitled <hi>The Art of Longevity,</hi> or, <hi>A Dieteticall Institute,</hi> may very well seem unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary and superfluous, after so many Tracts of the same subject, by the long-liv'd <hi>Lessius, Cornarus,</hi> and others, who have ingrossed all that can be said, and left Posterity nothing but to practise. But as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Verses indeed have the fate to be both slighted and condemned, and yet, like other faults, <hi>retained.</hi> And though Poetry and Oratory both (if lookt upon in the art and respect) are but the lowest of endowments; yet as their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may be, they both raise them and themselves.

Wherefore in all <hi>Physical</hi> practise there are no such observant Patients as your selves, whether the business concern your health or your ornament, your <hi>being</hi> or your <hi>well-being.</hi> Now a book of Diet presented to you is like to be of most happy events, who if you are told the quality of your food, will not erre in the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity. The first of these is my care at present, the second is your constant use: for neither to your <hi>noble sex,</hi> nor any of the <hi>nobler,</hi> will I prescribe any measure in meat, though there ought to be one in all things: the Beasts themselves (even all but Horses, Dogs, and Swine) have attained to such a natural stint.
