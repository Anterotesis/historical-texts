         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:5330:8"/>
vpon our first landing there? I presume, I speake to melting hearts of flesh, as tenderly sensible of your brethrens woe, as heartily thankful for your owne good.</p>
            <p>And now, beloued, since the case is altered, that all difficulties are swallowed vp: And seeing, first, there is no danger by the way; neither through encountring of enemy, or Pyrate; nor meeting with rockes, or Sholes (all which to Sea-faring men are very dangerous, and from all which your Ships and people are farre remoued, by reason of their faire and safe passage through the maine Ocean) nor through the tediousnesse of the passage; the fittest season of the yeare for a speedie passage, being now farre better knowne then before; and by that meanes the passage it selfe made almost in so many weekes, as formerly it was wont to be made in moneths; which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue to be, through the blessing of God, the maine cause of the safe arriuall of your last Fleete of nine Sayle of Ships, that not one (but one, in whose roome there was another borne) of eight hundred, which were transported out of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> for your Plantation, should miscarry by the way; whereas in your former voyages scarce 80. of a 100. arrived safely in <hi>Virginia.</hi> And secondly, seeing there is no Danger after their landing, either through <hi>warres,</hi> or <hi>famine,</hi> or <hi>want of conuenient lodging, and looking too,</hi> through which many miscarried heretofore; for, blessed be God, there hath beene a long time, and still is a happie league of Peace and Amitie soundly concluded,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:5330:9"/>
and faithfully kept, betweene the <hi>English</hi> and the <hi>Natiues,</hi> that the feare of killing each other is now vanished away. Besides, there is now in your Plantation plentie of good and wholesome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions for the strength and comfort, not onely of the Colony, but also of all such as after their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage doe land ashore. There is also convenient lodging, and carefull attendance provided for them, till they can provide for themselues; and a faire Inne for receiuing and harbouring of Strangers, erecting in <hi>Iames</hi> Cittie; to the setting vp of which, both your worshipfull Governour, Sir <hi>Francis Wyat,</hi> and your worthie Treasurer, Master <hi>George Sands</hi> doe write, that they doubt not, but there will be raised betweene fifteene hundred and two thousand pounds; to which euery man contributeth cheerefully and bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; they being all free-hearted, and open-han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to all publique good workes. Seing, I say, that now all former difficulties (which much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the progresse of your noble Plantation) are removed, and in a maner ouercome: And that your people in your Colony (through Gods mercy) were all in good health, euery one busied in their Vocations, as Bees in their Hiues, at the setting sayle of your Ship the <hi>Concord</hi> from <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia</hi> in March last.

            </p>
            <p>But to passe from the Danger and deliverance of your people, who indangered, yea, lost their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:5330:9"/>
liues in setling of your Plantation, consider, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you, in the second place, the Danger where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your whole Colony stood, at the time of Sir <hi>Thomas Gates</hi> arriving in <hi>Virginia</hi> from the <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ilands,</hi> when it was concluded a few dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his landing, by himselfe, Sir <hi>George Summers,</hi> Captaine <hi>Newport,</hi> and the whole Counsell, by the generall approbation of all, to abandon the Colony (because of the want of provisions) and to make for <hi>New-found-land,</hi> and so for <hi>England.</hi> And will not the hopefull setling of your Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny there, now vnder the Government of a worthy and worshipfull Commander; and a wise and wel-experienced Counsell, stirre you vp to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse before the Lord his louing kindnesse, and his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull workes before the sonnes of men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, if neither the Danger of your people; nor the Danger of your whole Colony abroad, and the Deliverance vouchsafed to them both be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to stirre you vp to confesse before the Lord his louing kindnesse: Then I beseech you, in the third place, to consider the Danger of your owne selues here at home. What masse of money haue you buried in that Plantation? How many of you had it not made to wish that you had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer put your hand to this Plough? Nay, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you had it not made to shrinke in your shoulders; and to sinke (as it were) vnder the burden, and to be quite out of hope for euer see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing penny of that you had so largely depursed?</p>
            <p>And now, Beloued, is not the case altered? Are not your hopes great of seeing; nay, of feeling,
