            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>IS Excellence the Earle of Eſſex, ſtill endeavouring for the good &amp; welfare of his King, and a peace and fraternity to and amongſt his Subjects, having had ſeverall parties, and more debates concerning our now conditionall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, yet finding no love from thence but meere oppoſition, and ſtill thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting more and more for the effuſion of blood, of the Malignants of this now diſtreſſed Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and ſtill craving from our ſoveraigne Lord the King a faire reconciliation,

            <p>And therefore in eſpeciall wiſe did admoniſh and impart theſe enſuing particulars, for the better ſatisfaction of every particular conſcience:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the ſufferances we have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone are reduced into two heads: The firſt concerning God, the next the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</hi>

            <p n="4">4. <hi>That God having weighed his cauſe, finding it ſtuft and ramm'd with manifold works of Satan, and more and more endeavouring ſtill to creep in, he in eſpeciall wiſe took upon him his owne juſt and irreproveable cauſe, and raiſed us as inſtruments for ſo good a worke.

            <p>
               <hi>Therefore as you are Members of God, and Subjects to our Soveraign Lord the King, firſt in Gods name put to your helping hands for Gods cauſe, your King and Kingdomes cauſe, and for a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of that hoped bliſſefull comfort (the Goſpel) which ſhall bring us and our poſterity in the future to eternitie, and for a bleſſed and comfortable raigne to our deare Soveraigne, and his Royall Progenie, the good and comfort of our preſent condition, the liberty, priviledg, and freedome of a Chriſtian Subject, and for a happy and bleſſed union betweene King and people: and therein we are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver honoured, and our ſelves worthy to be called Gods children.</hi>

Here in is manifeſted and made known the faith and love of ſo good a Subject, both in Gods cauſe, his King and Kingdoms cauſe, and it is hoped that no honeſt indifferent Subject, that aimes at the well and peacefull raign of our Soveraign, and the peace &amp; wel-fare of this Common-wealth, can any way repine or be offended, but rather adde to their love and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie, from hence a better portion.</p>
