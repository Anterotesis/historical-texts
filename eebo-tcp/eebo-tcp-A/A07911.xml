            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So my sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple selfe (Right Honourable) hauing sufficiently seene the rare vertues of your noble minde, the heroycall quallities of your prudent person: thought, though abilitie were inferiour to gratifie with some gift, yet good will was ample to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe with the best. When all the braue <hi>Gallants</hi> and woorthy <hi>Gentlemen</hi> in <hi>Roome,</hi> presented vnto the <hi>Emperour Iewels</hi> and gifts of great value and esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:

                  <p>And loe Right Honourable, among such expert heads, such pregnaunt inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and such commendable writers, as preferre to your seemely selfe, woorkes woorthy of eternall memory: A simple Soule, (more imboldened on your clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, then any action whatsoeuer he is able to make manifest) presumeth to present you with such vnpullished practises: as his simple skill is able to comprehend. Yet thus much I am to assure your Honour, that among all them which owe you du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull seruice, and among all the braue Bookes which haue beene bestowed: these my little labours containe so much faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full zeale to your welfare, as others whatsoeuer, I speake without any excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion.

But as the puissantest Prince is not voyde of enemies, the gallantest Champion free from foes, and the moste honest liuer without some backbiters: euen so the brauest Bookes hath many malicious iudgements, and the wisest writers not without rashe reports. If then (Right Honourable) the moste famous are fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d fault withall, the cuningest controlled, &amp; the promptest wits reproched by spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full speeches: how dare so rude a writer as I, seeme to set foorth so meane a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, so weake a woorke, and so skillesse a

When the learned are deluded: I must needes be mocked, and when the skilfullest are scorned: I must needes be derided: But yet I remember, the wise will not reprehend rashly, the learned condemne so lightly, nor the courteous misconster the good intent of the writer: But onely sutch as <hi>Aesops</hi> Dog, that brags but dares not bite, hid in a hole and dare not shewe their heads, against all such, the countenaunce of your Honour is sufficient to contend, which makes me not feare the force of their enuie.

This aforesayde Gonzalo, (renowmed for his princely gouerment, obayed for his singuler wisdom, praysed for his pollitique suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of prowde vsurpinge enimies, and honored for his humilytie to his subiects in generall) was not onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as a second Mutio among his freends and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyars, but euen amonge his very enemies was also estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as a prince worthy of eternall memory. And na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the more to agrauate his ioyes in his hoary haires: gaue hym a Sonne called Zelauto, whose singuler hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, whose puisance in feates of armes, whose dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie in witte, and whose comelye shape in personage, caused hym through all Venice to bee greatly accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of.</p>

father) one day by chaunce tooke courage to open the hidden thoughts which longe incombred his carefull breast, and hauing espied his father at such conuenient leasure, as serued best for his auayle, yeelding his obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunce as dutie beseemed, entred into this discourse.</p>
                  <p>If (Right woorthy and renowmed Father) nature had adorned me with such rare and excellent quallities, as might procure an hartes ease and ioy vnto your prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly estate: then would dutie cause me to keepe my minde in silence, and feare (of displeasing your aged hart) byd me restrayne my vowed attempt. But sith I am desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of that which my hart desireth, &amp; willing to gaine the same by painefull industry: I hope I shall purchase no ill will of your person, nor displease the mindes of your subiectes in generall. First weigh and consider by your gratious aduisement, that a youthfull minde more desireth the fragrant fieldes: then the hidden house, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome confesseth, yea, and lawe of Nature alloweth, that it is more permanent to a princely courage, to seeke the renowmed mansion, of the most illustrious and sacred Ladye Fame: then to drowne his youthfull dayes in gulfs of gaping greef, in sile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t sorrows, in vaine thoughts and cogitations, and also in trifling and idle exercises, which maketh him more prone vnto vice then vertue, more apt vnto lewdnes: then contented liuing, yea, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him so friuilous and fantasticall, that nothing but libidinous thoughtes, beastly behauiour, is his whole exercise. For then euery blasing beame, and euery sugred countenaunce of a woman allureth him, that floting on the Seas of foolish fansie, and hauing abid one lusty gale of winde, wherewith the Barke of his body, is beaten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Rockes of his Ladyes lookes, then the poore

patient falleth into so extreme an extasie, that one worde will kill him, and an other reuiue him. Thus is he inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed amid these subtill snares, while in the warlike feeld he might enioy his libertie, and their win fame which should last eternally. These and such like crabbed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites (deere Father) vrgeth me to craue your leaue and licence, that I may a while visite straunge Countries, In which time, I doubt not but to atchieue such exploytes, that at my returne it will be treble ioy to your Princely eares to heare them recounted.</p>
                  <p>Sonne Zelauto (aunswered the Duke) this your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is both commendable, and allowable, for I lyke well of your intent, and with all my hart giue consent that for a limitted time you shal seeke aduentures, which time shall amount vnto .vi. yeares, and on my blessing I charge thee, not to breake that appointed time. In the meane while, if God call me (as my life is vncertaine) I frankly &amp; freely giue thee all is myne. Wherfore looke well to thy selfe, that good report may be heard of thee, which vnto me will be great contentation. But nowe as touching what ayde and assistance thou wilt haue with thee: speake, and it shall be graunted. Good Father (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered Zelauto) none but onely one to beare me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, which I know will be sufficient. Well (quoth the Duke) receiue heere my blessing, this portion of money, and this knight to beare thee company. And I pray God in all thy wayes to guide and protect thee, and so you may depart when you please.</p>
                  <p>Zelauto accompanied with his knight, departed from the Court of his famous Father, and tooke shipping to goe vnto Naples, from thence, he trauailed vnto Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia in Spayne, and chauncing into the company of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne

English Merchauntes, who in the Latine tongue told him the happy estate of England, &amp; how a worthy Princes gouerned their common weale, and all suche thinges as could not be more praysed then they deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. The which Zelauto hearing, craued of them that he might sayle with them into England, and he woulde liberally reward them. They beeyng contented, and hauing laden their Shippes with such necessaryes as they best desyred: within fewe dayes hoysed sayles, and away they went.</p>
                  <p>This young youth Zelauto beeyng come into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and seene the rare and vertuous vsage of the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious and thrise renowmed Princes, with the great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and fauour which he obtayned among her woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Lordes: purposed to stay still there. But yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, that although he sawe one place: many others were as yet vnseene, after a yeere expyred, he tooke shipping into Persia, and so departed. In processe of time he had visited many straunge Countryes, sustay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned many and wonderfull iniuryes among the Turkes, which after shall be declared. And returning home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, happened on the borders of Sicile, where For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was fauourable vnto him: that vnawares he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened on the caue of a valiaunt Knight, who was a Christian, and hauing committed an hainous offence: fled out of his owne Countrie, and inhabited there in a silent Cell, among the woods. This Knight beyng na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Astraepho, and hearing the trampling of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his denne: tooke his weapons, and came foorth.

Gentleman, haue you taken quiet rest this night or no? Yes surely Misteris (quoth I) I neuer slept so soundly in all my life before, and credit me, I finde my selfe very well amended. Wherefore now I will rise. No not yet Sir (quoth she) you shall first make your Collation in bed, with such things as I haue ordayned, and haue your wounds dressed agayne:<note place="margin">They fall in talke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</note> and then shall you rise. I thanke you good Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steris <hi>Vrsula</hi> (quoth I) and surely it seemeth very straunge vnto me, that on a straunger you should bestowe such courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie? Sir (quoth she) on the vertuous and well disposed, no one can bestowe courtesie sufficient. As for my part, to such Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, as vpon some occasion are fallen into want &amp; neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie: I thinke it a great poynt of humanitie, to bestowe on them fréendly hospitalitie. And therefore I followe the minde of <hi>Lactantius,</hi>

The Scripture also maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how <hi>Abraham,</hi> receiued into his house (as he thought) men, but he receiued God himselfe. <hi>Lot</hi> also receiued Angels in the shape of men into his house. Wherefore for his hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie <hi>Lot</hi> escaped the fire of <hi>Sodom</hi> &amp; <hi>Gomorra.

Therfore sir séeme not to be offended I pray you, though I preach on this fashion, for both loue, dutie, faith and charity, dooth bind me to welcome you hether curteously. Alas good Misteris (quoth I) I sée well your great curtesie, but I knowe not how to requite the same. Sir (quoth she) what you are not able to doo: God will doo for you, and it is sufficient for me to receiue thankes at your handes, for greater is my reward in heauen. And with that she departed to fetch me my breakefast. Now syr, tell me I pray you, if the memory of this rare and vertuous woman is not woorthy to be rehearsed?</p>

Surely syr <hi>Strabino,</hi> I haue wanted your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all this day, for I haue sitten héere very solitary, and lackt such co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany as might procure some pleasure, &amp; now you are come: I hope we shall passe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time more merier, then hyther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I haue done, and therfore you are welcome hartily.</p>

                     <hi>Strabino</hi> hearing the courteous words of his Lady <hi>Cornelia</hi>: was surprised with such inward ioy, that he neyther minded his former feare, nor yet the present peryll that might happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to him, but wholy depending vpon his dutifull alleageaunce, and imbracing in minde &amp; thought her supposed lyking: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardeth his heart to stand vnto the hap, and yéeldeth him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Wherfore, he neyther distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting his sences with any seuerall motion, nor occupying his brayne vpon manifolde matters: desyreth pardon for that which his lyppes shall yéelde vnto lybertie, and her good construction in his actions whatsoeuer.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ady (quoth <hi>Strabino</hi>) I muse why the Gods, framing you first to be as a comfortable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion vnto man: you should so much digresse as to be the only instrument of our sorrowfull sadnesse, rather a woorker of our woe: then one that wisheth our well fare. For this is perfectly knowen (I speake not vpon had I wist) that you Women, for the most part, are so coy of your conditions, and so curious in your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceytes: that you neyther estéeme the quantitie nor quallitie of affection: nor yet the only perfect ground of our prosperity. For admit that a whyle you beare vs in hand with many an Amorous countenaunce, many a gallant glóse of firme fayth and fidelitie, yea, many a subtill surmise of pure looue and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, haue you once gotten that which you would haue, to fléece our purses to pranke you in pride, that you may sweat in your Sylks, whyle we goe threadbare, you on your Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofles, when we haue scant a good shooe to our foote, you at your delycate iunckets, when we are glad to ryse with emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie bellyes, and you so much in your brauerie, that you bring vs to vtter beggerie: In fayth, then fare well frost, more such haue we lost.</p>
                  <p>Nay now, since he can holde out no longer: fare well he, in faith he was a good fellowe whyle he had it, but nowe since he hath no more inke in his pen: let him goe shake his eares, a new customer, a new. So long time was he fed with fancies: that after he cursseth his folly. So long looued in lookes: that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:21449:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
at length he lamenteth his losse. So long helde vp with wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and wily woordes: that in the ende he cursseth such pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie fables. A colde sute, and a harde penniwoorth haue all they that traffique for such mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dize. On the other side, let a man holde vp you at rack staues, diferre you of with doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full delayes, alleadge vnto you many defectes of abillitie, and besides that, kéepe that from you which most willingly you would haue: In faith, then he is a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfayt cranke, a sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse shéepbyter, a worldly miser, he is no good fellowe, that will not lay his penny by theyrs, a craking Companion, an eue dropper: with such and so many floutes they haue, that it is woonderfull to heare.</p>
                  <p>What great reproche is this to such wanton Women, that regard more an ell of pleasure, then an ynch of profite? more desirous of loathsome lybertie, then they care for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented lyuing? What maketh so many young Gentlemen crack theyr credite, loose theyr good name, mortgage theyr ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinges, barter away all they haue: but such carelesse compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? When before, they were in good and honest commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation among all men: now are they glad to hide theyr heads for shame.</p>
                  <p>I speake not this (déere Lady) to the reproche of all Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: for that were méere impudencie: but I speake in the contempt of all such as dayly frequent it, as these Cortizans which abide in the brothell house héere in <hi>Verona,</hi> &amp; besides them, many a one that beares a gallant grace through the Cittie: taketh a snatch now and then, which by right deserue a greater reproche, then they that so dayly vse it. For by such meanes is vice intruded among the vertuous, making many that (God knowes) are well disposed lyuers, to be lyghtly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpted of, only by vsing the company of such carelesse cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures.</p>
                  <p>Syr <hi>Strabino</hi> (quoth <hi>Cornelia</hi>) your discourse hath béene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyghtfull, yet sauoureth it sharpe some where, belyke you haue bene bitten, or stung by some of these Waspes: and that maketh you so expert in bewraying theyr qualities, for the mother would neuer haue sought her daughter in the Ouen,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:21449:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but that shée had béene there her selfe, and he that is galded, hath good occasion to kicke. You haue béene bartering, &amp; found all so déere in the market: that no butter wyll sticke on your bread, or belyke you haue sauced some body: and payd swéet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for it.</p>
                  <p>But what maketh you to exclayme against women in this order? haue you looued, and not béene looued againe? haue you sought for honny, &amp; caught the Bée by the tayle: or haue you neuer looued, and wholy giuen your selfe there against? if so you haue, the harder is your happe, for farre vnable are you to stand against the decrée of the gods, and haue you not read of diuers that haue repugned against looue: which haue béene inforced to fancie theyr inferiors? Take héede <hi>Strabino,</hi> least in your denying to looue some gallant Lady: you be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie som poore <hi>Fachine</hi> héere in <hi>Verona.</hi> If you haue looued, &amp; not béene looued againe: you are to mooue your sute, and if it be to such a one who is frée from all other, and may well be your match: there is no doubt but after many sharpe showers, a gallant gale of winde will blow in the Skie, that will send your ioyes on heapes to you. I giue you the best counsayle that I can, and I would my proffered paynes any way might pleasure you. If either my woorde, counsayle, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, or ought else may preuayle you to her whome you lyke: credite me, you shall not finde me so ready in promising, as I wyll be in the performaunce therof.</p>
                  <p>Now Gentlemen, iudge you what sundrie &amp; seuerall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries assayled the assaulted minde of poore <hi>Strabino,</hi> to heare such courteous talke pronounced by the person whome hée most honored and obeyed. Yet doubted he, that if shée knew the very originall and only helpe for his heauines: shée would be as slowe to performe, as she was ready to promise, but yet buylding still on good hope of her bountie: hée procéeded into farder talke.</p>
                  <p>My hope is (quoth he) my good Lady &amp; Mistresse, that what hath passed in my presumptuous talke, you will conster it at the best: but sure as yet I am frée from that which you haue supposed, only this I am to confesse, that I loue &amp; lyke, where
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21449:63"/>
I am neither refused nor yet entertained, wherfore I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not condempne vpon no occasion: nor I can not prayse before it be deserued. So that I am neither to vaunt as victor: nor yet to yéeld as altogether conquered. And why I haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyed against these sort of Women, I can yéeld you some suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reason: I haue known diuers of my fréends, that haue wasted out theyr web of youthfull time, in frequenting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with such wilfull Women. As for example, one déere fréende of mine, who was tost, turmoyled, and vtterly made hauock of: among those whome he thought had looued him dée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, yea some that were of good name and credit, that sucked him drye: &amp; then matched them selues with other. Therfore I say, it is hard to know who a man may trust now a dayes: for you Women are so craftie, that a man cannot tell howe to deale with you.</p>
                  <p>In déede Syr (quoth she) though we be craftie, you men are more deceyptfull. It behooueth vs to stand vpon our reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to make the matter nice and coy to some, for when they haue once caught vs: they will vse vs as they lyst. What sorrowe and care is it to be a maried Wife? that which God hath ordayned to be a comfort and solace betwéene man and woman, is made nowe a thing of most contempt: for when we be maried, then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth our cares all at once: how many frowning lookes? how many crabbed countenances? how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sharpe woordes? beside, how many continuall gréefes and sorrowes of the minde? If our Husbandes be a lyttle displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> house must be out of quiet. If he frowne, then what is next hand, flyes at the face of his Wife. If he sée her but merily disposed in any company, then is he ielous: if she looke on any man, then she lusteth after him. Then is she watcht and spied, in euery place where she goeth, to catche her in a tryp, the which vrgeth her sooner to doo it, when before she neuer thought it. What terror, &amp; what diuellish mindes are these of men: who when they come to wooing, then plead they simplicitie: then yea forsoothe, and no forsoothe, this shall be and that shall be, when God knowes, when it comes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: it is neyther so, nor so.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:21449:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>Can you blame Women, if they be so lothe to graunt to your requestes? and can you thinke them so harde, when you your selues are harder then the Adamant? Can you say Women are ordayned as a plague vnto men: when as you your selues plague them so cruelly? O déepe dissemblers, O prating Parasites? What subtill Sophisters? What faire mouthed fellowes are these? What paynted sheathes, fayre without &amp; fowle within? Who would thinke that you could beare such a double heart about with you. I hope you shall be fayne to say at length, <hi>Ars deluditur arte.</hi> Hencefoorth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neuer enuy at Women: when you are wurse your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, nor neuer play the Crauens, as Cockes of your owne dunghyll: the shame wyll redound where it is woorthy, and you shall be forced to crye <hi>Peccaui.</hi> Ah Syrra, though you haue all the learning, God hath leant vs some wyt, that wée should not be to much deceyued. Therefore neuer vpbrayde vs with such Rhetorical gloses, nor neuer fall out with those who are your best fréendes: If you lyke vs, loue vs: if not, let vs alone.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Strabino,</hi> halfe driuen in feare of incurring his Ladyes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, and doubting least his talke had bread some cause of melancholie: calles vp his wittes together, to make amends for his former fault. For thought he, if now I comming to speake for mine owne auayle, and to gayne the good wyll of my best belooued, should séeme to apprehend or reprehend in such causes as willingly shee would not: it might marre all my matter, and throwe all my good Fortune into the fyre. Wherfore, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the childe when he hath made a fault, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth créeping on his knées with bytter teares, willing to kisse the rod<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; so to pacifie the yre of his Parents whome he displeased, or as the Ape when he hath nipt one to the quick, and séeeth the whip holden vp in signe of correction: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth with chattering the téethe, holding vp the ten bones, so to content his maisters displeasure conceyued: Euen so méeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and mildly commeth <hi>Strabino</hi> to the loouing lap of his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and in sygne &amp; token of humilitie, vttereth these woordes. Déere Lady &amp; Mistresse, not so wel satisfied &amp; contented with
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:21449:64"/>
your reasonable replie: as sorrowfull for suffering my to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue so rashly to offend you. Rather impute it therefore to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuiousnesse of my selfe: then to any willingnesse so incurre your anger. More honour trulie shall it be to you, quietly to put vp the chollorike woords of an impudent Scholler: then to menace your anger, where as sorrow sufficient is retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. It is a good Horse that neuer stumbleth, he is verie cyrcumspect that speaketh alway without a fault, and he is verie vpright that neuer committeth crime. I must confesse my tongue ran before my wyt, and my mouth vttered that which my heart neuer thought. But the best is, my boasting brauerie, can blemishe none of your bountie: nor my fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke foolishnesse, impayre any of your vertuous credite. But all is well that is well taken, little sayde is soone amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and so I pray you pardon your penitent, and sorrowfull offender.</p>
                  <p>Syr <hi>Strabino</hi> (quoth she) for this fault, you haue already obtayned pardon, it was not so gréeuously taken as you thought for: nor it was not so fault woorthy as nowe you graunt it. I am not to exact the vttermost of any man: nor I am not to conceyue an anger before iust cause be offred, for you know, that what talke so euer we vse, that dooth not stretch beyond the boundes of honest and allowable reason: by promise is to be estéemed of no effect, therfore I discharge that Obligation of his full strength and vertue, and sticke to the promise passed. Mary, yet am I on the other side, to thinke well of you, that stoode in such awe of displeasing her: who was far more afrayd of incurring your anger. Wée women are not to be too captious nor to quarrellous, neither to hasty, nor to slowe, for it were no poynt of ciuillitie to handle our freendes churlishly, and it were méere folly to quip them vpon no greater occasion. Fyrst, we are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the efficient cause that vrgeth them to speake, &amp; to way it thorowly in the wayghts of modestie: and so to giue aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that we be neyther found to scripilous in the one, nor to coy in the other. I knowe you are my fréend, and so I estéeme you, and as my fréend I make accoumpt of you, then
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:21449:65"/>
neuer thinke that I your fréend will séeme to conster your meaning at the wurst: nor yet to condempne you vpon no greater occasion. I can not deny but that some are verie apt to anger, to receyue a matter yll, be it neuer so well spoken, that dooth demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strate a great error in her that vseth it, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer: and condempneth her of impudencie, for her so light beléefe. Soft fyre (they say) maketh swéete mault, a wyse Woman will way all with discretion: but a foole will be hasty, and to troublesome to deale with all. Wise <hi>Cato</hi> sayth, Bridle thine anger with modestie, and iudge not of a matter too rashly, for as there is great commendation in the one: so is there great shame followeth the other. It is a séemely thing for euerie one to vse theyr anger with discretion: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (perchaunce) it may redound to theyr discredite. Thus <hi>Strabino</hi> suffice your selfe, that the coales of my anger were soone kindled and soone quenched. For if I should be angrie with you: you might accoumpt it but the rashnesse of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and her want of foresight, and so I pray you take it,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Strabino,</hi> perceyuing the courteous excuse of <hi>Cornelia,</hi> and that his passed talke was taken in such gentle grée: thought it now good time to preferre his sute, and so desiring her pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, procéeded as followeth.</p>

I presume in place, where I behold this seemely shée: and the more I come in her company: the greater increaseth my care, the more I looke: the more I lyke, but lyking brings such restlesse woe: that were it not I had a soule to saue, and that I stand in awe of the anger of God: I should finish this Tragedie, with such a mercilesse massacring of my poore selfe, that neyther should she vaunt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> losse of my life: nor I be thought to demerit so dyrefull a death.

                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:21449:66"/>O Syr, soft fyre makes swéete Mault, it is yll to halt before a Criple, and it were shame to belye the Diuell. Your owne woordes dooth condempne you in that you haue spoken: or else you are very impudent, that you speake you know not what. Medicines you say, can make no amendment, the force of Phisicke to helpe you dooth fayle, and yet you say, there is one soueraigne salue can minister a remedie. O crafty head, your téethe will not let your tongue lye, in faith it is almost tyme to byd you good night. Yet to sée how you will maintayne your matter with wresting of woordes, you would make me beléeue the Moone is made of gréene chéese: In faith Syr no, you must rise somewhat more early, if you goe beyond me: and you must deale more subtilly, if you séeke to deceyue me. But truly if you were as mighty a man of your déede, as you are of your woorde: <hi>Verona</hi> would be little enough to holde you, and neuer a Woman of them all durst abyde your stearne countenaunce.

Which when <hi>Cornelia</hi> beheld how sadly he sate, and would speake neuer a woord, how his couller went and came, as though he had lyne a dying: thought it no courtesie to let him languishe so: but to giue him a fresh encouragement to reuiue vp his spyrites. Why Syr <hi>Strabino</hi> (quoth she) is your heart in you hose? Is your corragious countenaunce so soone chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to pale and wanny chéekes?

with any doubting dread, nor let not my talke so séeme to to trouble you, if I haue made a faulte: I aske you forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and if I haue displeased you: I will doo so no more.

I for my part am not offended with any thing spoken: and if you are, truly you be to blame. I will leaue your company, if you be not more merie, and will forsake héereafter any more to frequent it. Shake handes and be fréendes againe, and tell me who she is that you so faithfully looue: I will stand your fréende perhappes in the matter, and if of my selfe I am not able to doo it: I will informe those of it, who (doubt you not) shall bring it to effect.</p>
                  <p>With that <hi>Strabino</hi> reuiued him selfe out of his browne study, and began smugly to holde vp the head, right wylling he left his so sodayne quandarie: and began to looke vp with a sensorical countenance. His heart that before lay in a hole: was now ready for ioy to leap out at his mouth, his minde that earst was pinched with passions: was now so iocond, that it daunced with ioy, and his couller that before was as pale as ashes: began now as fresh as the redolent Rose, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie member which before séemed maimed: he could now stretch out to the ninth degrée. And if his present seruice might haue wonne him a Wife: he was able to discharge it, &amp; that to the vttermost, besides, his conceytes began to come so nimbly together: that he now rolled in his Rhethoricke, lyke a Flea in a blanquet. (Ah courteous <hi>Cornelia</hi> (quoth <hi>Strabino</hi>) how much am I bound in dutie to your séemly self? How much am I indebted to your prudent personage? that with such swéete perswasions, such maydenly and modest motions, such heroycall and singuler actions: hath losed to ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie a discouraged prisoner, and hath reuiued him to lyfe, who was almost past all hope of recouerie.</p>
                  <p>Excellent was the opinion of <hi>Valerius Maximus,</hi> who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the fréendly déedes, doone in aduersitie, as for prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie will succour it selfe. My selfe may be witnesse, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncing,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:21449:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
your fréendlines, whose aduersity was vncurable: had I not obtained councell of so prudent a Phisition. I tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k you for your fréendly offer, wishing I were able to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle it as I would, and that my might were correspondent to my well meaning intent: then should you sée the depth of my desyre, and haue occasion to thinke you should not passe vnrewarded The Lady whome I looue will be won to your will, the Saint whome I serue: will fulfill your request, and the least woord of your mouth, will binde vp the bargaine. So that doo you but speake: I speede, doo you say yea, and I shall haue no nay, so much dare I crake of her credite, and boast of her bountie: that you can not so soone say the woord: but she will wyllingly doo the déede.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cornelia</hi> smiling at this gallant glose, and hauing half a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture at what marke he aymed to shoote at: framed such an aunswere as she thought best her selfe, and to make <hi>Strabinos</hi> sute neuer the néere. The foolish Flye (quoth she) so long ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth with the Candle, that at last she sindgeth her selfe, the silly Mouse wandreth oft so farre abroade: that she is taken tardy before she come home, and the Nightinggale singeth so swéetly, tyll she fall in a sléepe, and so oftentymes is caught at vnawares. Lykewise, I haue helde you héere so long with a pleasaunt tale, that you make me halfe mistrust my selfe. If your Lady be so wilfull, to be wonne to my will, and so courteous that she will come at my call, yea, if I say the woord, you aske no better bargaine: either I must coniecture, that her affection is greater to me then to you: or that shée would clayme assurance of me for your good behauiour. Now credite me <hi>Strabino,</hi> you are wylie in your woordes: yet not so craftie, but I conceyue your meaning.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>But yet <hi>Strabino,</hi> let these matters passe, and to come to the poynt, whervpon we haue stoode so long, name me your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, what she is, and where she dwelleth: then shall you heare farder what I will doo for you. If so be (quoth <hi>Strabino</hi>) you will promise me no good will shall want on your part, to the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:21449:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fulfylling my request, and that you will not hinder the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I haue in hand: I will shew you the swéete she, whose captiue I am, and to whose looue I am thus intierly intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Syr (quoth she) <hi>Qui ante non cauit, post dolebit,</hi> A man may looue his house well, though he ride not on the roofe, and a man may make a good Mart, yet be no great gayner. There goeth more woordes to a bargayne then one, and other pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to be vsed beside the <hi>Pater noster,</hi> when you haue tolde me your tale: you shall sée what I will say, and though I make you no promise: doubt not but I will please you.</p>
                  <p>Then tooke <hi>Strabino</hi> vp her glasse that hung at her Gyrdle, and therein he framed many an Amorous countenaunce. At last (quoth <hi>Cornelia</hi>) what fancies finde you there, that makes you so pleasaunt? or haue you a delyght in beholding your owne face? Nay (quoth he) not for the fancie I finde in mine owne face: but for the comely countenaunce that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in my Lady and Mistresse. And haue you found her face there (quoth she) I pray you let me sée her, to iudge if I know her. After <hi>Cornelia</hi> had looked a whyle, she sayd. Why <hi>Strabino,</hi> you promised I should sée that séemely shée, to whom you owe such delightfull looue &amp; loyaltie. And what I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed (quoth he) hath béene héere performed. As how (quoth she) Whose face (quoth he) did you behold whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I shewed you? why yours and mine owne (quoth she) I thought it would come to such a passe, well I will speake to her, &amp; if she chaunce to giue her consent: doubt you not but you shall heare of it. But one thing I can tell ye, &amp; that you shall perfectly prooue, how shée is wedded to her will, and maried to her owne minde: that she had rather lyue a mayden styll, then be bydden to so bad a breakfast.</p>
                  <p>That were against reason (quoth he) that she should be so maryed to her minde: as not to respect one so good as her selfe, or that in disdayning so good a breakfast, be forced to come to a courser dinner. A little pyttance in the morning: is better then to be fasting all day, and perhaps, a good strong stake strooke in the hedge in Summer: will stand for a good defence in the Winter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:21449:68"/>Albeit Syr (quoth she) you are her better: yet she thinkes it not against reason to lyke before she looue, and though it be not expedient to giue the chyldrens bread to dogges: yet will they lycke the crums that falles from theyr maisters table. And besides she thinkes, that if she kéepe her stomacke for a good supper: she shall not take surfeit of her fasting all day. Lykewise, though the strong stake doo well fortifie the hedge for Winter: yet if the stake be without other defence: the Beasts will easily get ouer and spoyle the pasture, and so in tyme vtterly vndooe the owner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Strabino</hi> hauing well and sufficiently pondred her talke: thought now he would not discourage him selfe with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie of her deuises, but euen as his heart serued him he would make her an aunswer. Why Lady (quoth he) doo you misdoubt of my bountifull behauiour? or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I am such a one as regardeth not my honesty? Thinke you if I would make my choyse, I could not haue as good as you, or if my minde had béene so adicted, ere this I could not haue béene sped? thinke you all Women are of your minde? or that they will dislyke vpon no occasion? No credit me, <hi>Cornelia</hi> (I speake <hi>Bonafide</hi>) if my stomacke had serued: I could haue béene soone suffised, and if all Women were of your minde: I should haue but a colde sute with my wooing. But belyke you are betrothed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready: and that makes you so dayntie, if you be tell me, that I may loose no more labour.</p>
                  <p>Truly Syr <hi>Strabino</hi> (quoth she) if as yet I am betrothed: it is more then I know, what my Parents haue done, I know not, but as yet I can assure you, there is no such matter meant by me. But what of that, you are neuer the neerer your purpose, nor yet the likelyer to gayne my good wyll, you are a gallant Gentleman, well known in <hi>Verona,</hi> wherfore you may chaunce to lyght on a better bootie, and doubt you not but there are those, who with all theyr hearts would haue you. Wherfore good Syr, neuer féede your humors on such a homely péece: since there be more delycate Damoselles that will not deny you. But now it drawes toward sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per tyme, and occasion is so offred: that perforce I must leaue
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:21449:68"/>
you, desiring you not to déeme any discourtesie, that I leaue your company so soone.</p>
                  <p>Nay (quoth <hi>Strabino</hi>) I am not to conceyue the wurst of your departure: but rather to thanke you, that vouchsaued my company so long, no anger I trust is conceyued for my superfluous spéeche: but rather pardoned for that no disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie was meant. Thus thanking you a thousand tymes for your courtesie offered: tyll Fortune so frame our next méeting together, I commend you to God, whome I pray graunt me my wishe, and you the depth of your desire.</p>
                  <p>Thus Gentlemen is <hi>Cornelia</hi> and <hi>Strabino</hi> parted, he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the way home to his Chamber: and she spéedeth her selfe that she were at supper, but so sowre a sauce she had giuen <hi>Strabino</hi>: that the sharpnesse turned his stomacke from min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any meate. It is not straunge to sée what a metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesis Looue maketh of a man? that he which earst might haue bragged with the best: is now become to carefull for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny company, he which earst walked the stréetes with a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant grace: nowe pulleth his bonet ouer his browes, that none may beholde his sodayne alteration? He which before lyued merily, faring with the finest, and delyghting in the dayntiest: now scant eateth a good meales meate in a month. He commeth to his Chamber, throweth him selfe on his bed, incombred with so many cares, that it is vnspeakable: at last vnto him selfe talketh in this order.</p>
                  <p>O God, where are become the loftie lookes I vsed before I was a Loouer? Where are the curious countenaunces, the wayghtie woordes, the dayntie dealinges, the bolde behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and the manly order of lyfe wherein I lyued before? Hath Looue so puissaunt a power to reuert my swéetnesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sorrowes, my myrth into mazednesse, my life into langor, and all my happinesse into a state so helplesse? O gréefe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ende, O sorrowes without ceasing, O hellish tormentes that hath no conclusion. But yet am I the first that was framed to folly? Or I am the last that shall be lead by Looue? Hath not the Gods themselues béene subiect to lyke mestiue miseries? Did not <hi>Iupiter</hi> enter <hi>Acrissius</hi> tower, in the shape
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:21449:69"/>
of a fayre swimming Swan, to deflowre faire <hi>Danea? Apollo</hi> persecuted <hi>Daphne</hi> to get his will of her: <hi>Neptune</hi> begatte <hi>Nauplius</hi> father to <hi>Palamedes</hi> of <hi>Amimone,</hi> daughter of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaeus: Mercurie</hi> lay with <hi>Lar</hi> the beautifull <hi>Nimphe,</hi> and got of her two prety chyldren called <hi>Lares.</hi> Likewise king <hi>Dauid</hi> became conuinced by the looue of <hi>Bersaba: Salomon</hi> the wise was subiect to looue likewise. If then looue hath made the Gods to agrée, the wise to be wilfull, the stoutest to stoupe: is it possyble for me poore <hi>Strabino,</hi> to resist a thing of such force? O <hi>Cornelia,</hi> lyttle doost thou estéeme the good wyll I beare thée, lyttle doost thou accoumpt of my constancie, lyttle doost thou regard my restlesse rage, &amp; little doost thou déeme all my dollorous doubtes. Is thy heart so frosen, that the sunny beames of bounty may not make it to melt? Is thy minde so misbeléeuing, that no faithfull fidelitie may séeme to reforme it? Is not dayly proofe sufficient to trye my trustinesse? Is not the great good will I beare thée, able to cause thée to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpt well of me? To offer me crueltie for courtesie, thou doost me open iniurie. Alas wretched wight that I am, whose miserie is more then mine? Whose dayes more dollorous, whose tyme more troublesome, whose life more loathsome, &amp; whose state more yrksome, the day to me is nothing delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: the night more carefull, sléepe I can not, and waking, I neuer cease wayling.</p>
                  <p>Sometime I syt to conquere the cogitations, which weary my wittes: then againe am I driuen into a more déepe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire. Sometime I scorne and laugh at Looue, thinking mine owne wyll a sufficient warrant: but then in a moment ary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth manifolde miseries, so that neither waking nor sléeping, walking or sitting, can my sorrowfull selfe sustayne any rest. Why wast thou borne to abide such bitternesse? why hast thou lyued to sée this trystfull tyme? why hath not death desired his due: and the graue cutte of this mercilesse gréefe? O Laberinth of intricate euylles, O maze of endlesse my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, whome neither dutifull surrendring of my selfe may suffise: nor any vertuous action séeme to content you. Cease <hi>Strabino,</hi> giue not thy selfe altogether to insolencie, nor frame
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:21449:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not thy selfe wholy vanquished with follyes, time may turne thy troubles to tranquilitie, tyme may make thy foes thy fréendes, and tyme may reuert all thy paynes to pleasure. Impute not thy Lady altogether disloyall, for he that spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth at the first: wooeth well, and he that hath no denyall: in my opinion is very fortunate.</p>
                  <p>In these and such lyke carefull complayntes the solytarie <hi>Strabino</hi> hath worne away the wearysome night. In the morning commeth his brother and fréend <hi>Rodolfo,</hi> to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the cause of his sodaine sicknesse.</p>

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The olde horson would néedes be lusty, and to chéerishe vp his churlishe carkase, would get him a wanton Wife. And though I say it, he was as well made a man, and as curious in his quallities: as euer an olde Horse in this towne, when he is gnabling on a thystle. This carpet Knight, hauing pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him selfe vp in his perfumes, and walking so nice on the ground, that he would scant bruse an Onion: comes to the house of <hi>Signor Giorolamo Ruscelli,</hi> bringing with him a verie costly Cuppe, wherein was about fiue hundred Crownes. When he was come into the presence of the Gentleman, he sayd Syr, as one right glad to heare of your health, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling besides to woorke your well fare: I am come to sée how it fareth with you; because that long tyme I haue béene desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> First Syr, this Cuppe I fréely giue you, and these fiue hundred Crownes, I frankly bestowe on you, besides if you pleasure me in my reasonable request: you shall finde me your fréend in more then I wyll speake of.</p>
                  <p>The Gentleman amazed at <hi>Truculentos</hi> lyberalytie, who
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:21449:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
before would scant bestowe on him selfe a good meales meate for expence of money: made him this aunswere. I can not chuse Syr, but consider well of your courtesie, and lykewise estéeme of your bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifull beneuolence, vndeserued of my part to be so rytchly rewarded: considering my countenaunce to you hath béene small. And if your request be so reasonable as you séeme to affyrme, &amp; that it lyeth in me to bring the same to effect: doubt not that I will make you any denyall, since you haue gratified me with so great a gyft. Well Syr, now <hi>Truculento</hi> trusseth vp his towardnesse, and bustleth vp his braynes lyke a bunch of Radishe, setting vp his wyttes to woorke about his Amorous eloquence: he thus began to tell foorth his tale. It may be thought to you good Syr, eyther a naturall inclination, or a predestinate desire, that a man of my yéeres should now be bent to folly, in crauing that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany which a youthfull head requyreth, and seeking to match my selfe in mariage, drawing each day to my death. But as a good foresight in all thinges is to be had, and dillygent indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry kéepes the Woolfe from the doore. Euen so, though I am to be thought fonde in following my wyll, I am to be excused in wishing my weale. Yet this may be alleadged to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne mine assertion, and this may be thought, I do it more for lust then looue. That in making my choyse, I am not more cyrcu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, and in ruling my will, I am not more wise. The hoary heayres should chuse one agréeable to his age, the lusty youth one méete to his tender tyme: then if this allegation may stand in effect, I haue made my market farre amisse. On age I begin to bend my browes: and on a gallant Girle I fixe my fancie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Age of me is altogether despised: and youthfull yéeres honored and exalted, Age in my minde is nothing holsome: but beauty is braue, delycate and toothsome. So Syr, if I may gaine her whom I haue thus chosen: I shall not be only pleasured, but your selfe for euer héereafter profited. Your Daughter it is whome I desire, it is euen she whom I serue, and none but she must be my solace. If you accept my sute, make aunswer accordingly: and if I shall haue your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, doo not deny me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:21449:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>The Gentleman hauing well lystened this newe come wooers tale, and seeing at what marke he leueld his looue, he bring one him selfe that preferred money before manly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie, coyne before courteous ciuillitie, and rytches before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vertuous action, besides, ouercome with the costlynesse of the Cuppe, out of measure contented with the fiue hundred Crownes: Furthermore he thought, if he matched his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with him: she would soone send him to Church, and then should she swym in her golden bagges: was verie lothe to send away such a swéete Suter, thinking it rare to haue a rytcher: wherefore to <hi>Truculento</hi> he made this aunswere.</p>
                  <p>I hope Syr, you doubt not of the good will I wishe you, nor of the courtesie you shall finde héereafter, your reasonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest is altogether allowed: and your gentle gyft greatly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. I would my Daughters dowrie were as much as I could wishe it: I would bestowe it on man sooner then your selfe. With that he called for his Daughter <hi>Cornelia,</hi> who when she was come into this olde amorous Squyres presence: his heart began to heaue lyke a Bakers bun, his whole complexion so myraculously chaunged: that you could scant haue knowen him from a Croydon sanguine. Oh so his Amorous eyes beganne to looke on his new Wife, I am sure he would haue spent all the shooes in his shop to haue had one kysse for a courteous <hi>Conge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Loe Daughter (quoth her Father) God hath sent you héere a Husbande, one that will maintayne you in your brauerie with the best, and you shall lacke nothing, but lyue a Ladyes lyfe, now make aunswere as you shall thinke best.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cornelia</hi> somewhat mooued at this made matter, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contented with her Fathers choyse, all her senses di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted with this sodayne motion: yet tooke corrage to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere the matter in this sort. Déere Father, it is the duty of the Chylde to be obedient to her Parentes preceptes: and it is the Fathers fame to haue his Chylde vertuously nurtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I confesse it is my part to obay your graue aduise: and it ought to be your care to sée me méetely matched. If then your care be no better bestowed: my dutie must be as much
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:21449:74"/>
neglected, though your will be to sée me carelesly cast away, if it lye in me, I am to preuent it, bothe for the credit of your woorthy estate: and also for the good name of my simple selfe. Wyll you for money marrie me to a myser? Wyll you for wealth wedde me to a Wyttoll? And wyll you for rytches so lyttle regard me? Shall I for a lyttle vaine glorie? for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake vertue? Shall I for paltrie pride run headlong to hell? Shall I for mortall muck, forsake immortality? No Father, had he wytte to his wealth: he would be more wise, had he reason to his rytches, he would be of more regard, and had he manhood to his money: he would be ashamed of his extorting vsury. For what is wealth without wisdome? Ritches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reason, and money disorderly gouerned? Euen lyke the shadowe of a man portraited in a picture, that hath all the lyneaments in good order belonging to a man: yet wants the man him selfe, for as the Image lacketh lyfe to his proper proportion: so this man wants that which should most of all adorne him. Rather had I you should haue chosen a countrey Clowne, that getteth his lyuing lawfully, &amp; lyueth by trueth and honesty: then such a one as is not acquainted with any vertuous behauiour. I must confesse he is wise enough, to make much of his money, and carefull beside how to cull in his coyne, but he that will run to the diuell for a lyttle drosse: and pinche the poore to the perdition of his owne soule: shall neuer be looued of me whyle I liue, much lesse intende I to haue him to my Husband.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Truculento</hi> heard <hi>Cornelias</hi> pinching reply, and how she disdayned such a loathsome lyuer: he would with all his heart haue had his Cup againe, on condition he would neuer come more a wooing. Yet set he a good face on the matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would not be misdoubted, and fayne he would haue spoken, but his heart was so bigge he could not, the which her Father séeing, sayd.</p>
                  <p>Come Syr, we will goe walke about the Cittie a whyle, and neuer dismay your selfe at the woordes of my Daughter, for will she, nill she: I will haue her followe my minde in this matter. Away went olde <hi>Truculento</hi> with a heauy heart,

yet the Gentlemans woordes, procured him to be of better chéere.</p>
                  <p>They were no sooner out of the doore: but in came <hi>Rodolfo</hi> and <hi>Strabino</hi> bothe together, and <hi>Strabino</hi> in walking: had bewrayed to his fréend the sum of his secretes, whereto he gayned so much his good will: that he promised he would further it as much as he might. When they came into the Garden: there they found <hi>Cornelia</hi> very sad and sorowfull. Why Syster (quoth <hi>Rodolfo</hi>) how happens it that you séeme so sad?

But if wealth may make a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wise: he will brag with the best, or his extortion make him estéemed: he wyll be nothing behinde hand. But if vertue should vaunt &amp; clayme for her fee: this comely Squyre were sunk in the wetting, &amp; all his credite crackt before it were gotten. But to come to the effect of the matter, &amp; to let passe his properties: without they were prayse woorthy, and to shew the cause of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,

and his sute to my Father. It is so, that this money myser: is become a lusty loouer, and bringing a gorgious gift to gratify my Father: the Amorous whorson would haue me to his wife. Now my father (as you know) hath a good minde to money, &amp; lookes that the olde suter will soone turne vp his héeles, (so then shall I haue more money then modest man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and greater store of substaunce, then wisedome to rule it,) he would néedes make him promise, that he should wedde me to his Wife.

                  <p>Now surely Syster (quoth <hi>Rodolfo</hi>) I must commend your constancie, and allow the care of your credit, before such a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting drudge should spoyle your gallant youth: my selfe would tell my Father an other tale.

This match is more séemely: then my Fathers foreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, &amp; this is more agréeable to God: then to haue you vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in that order, for where perfect looue is effectually placed: there is triumphant tranquillitie, peace and plentie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gods blessing and sufficient. But where mariage is made vpon compulsion, the one agréeing, the other disdayning: there is dayly discorde, displeasing of God, continuall care, and many infirmities followeth. Wherefore I thinke this a match so méete: that it can not be mended, a choyse so equall: as there can be no better, héere is looue and loyaltie, héere is fayth and fidelitie, God prospere your procéeding, I wishe it hartily.</p>
                  <p>Now Gentlemen, iudge if <hi>Strabino</hi> had not cause to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious of so gallant a conquest? of so péerelesse a prize, and so loouing a Lady? Whose ioy was more iocond? Whose blisse more bountifull? And whose hap might be compared to <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binos</hi> good lucke, in compassing that in a moment: which he thought would neuer haue come to effect, and in getting the good wyll of so gallant a Goddesse, so swéete a Saint, and so mercifull a Mistresse.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore now leauing the languishing of his sorrowfull sicknesse, and forsaking the feare that earst followed his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: he saluteth his Lady with this courteous replye. I sée (most mercifull Mistresse) that there is no disease so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate: but helpe may be had, no sicknesse so sore: but Phisicke can foyle it, no wound so daungerous: but a swéete salue can recure it, no gréefe so great: but patience bringes prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and no doubt so dreadfull: but tyme bringeth to full effect. Sée héere, he that was earst drowned in doubten: now hoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in happynesse, he that earst remayned in vnmercifull my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie: nowe floteth in florishing felycitie, he that earst was plundged in pittyfull perplexitie: hath chaunged his state to perfect prosperitie. If <hi>Caesar</hi> héere would commit to me all

his conquers, <hi>Craesus</hi> his puissant possessions, or the thrée Goddesses proffer vnto me, as they dyd to <hi>Paris</hi>: None could so much please me, as you my second selfe, none could more delyght me: then my Iewell so gentle, nor any more lyke me then my Lady so loyall, whose courteous constancie: high <hi>Ioue</hi> prosper in perpetuitie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cornelia</hi> séeing <hi>Strabino</hi> in the myddest of his myrth, and hauing deuised a drift to fal pat to their pleasures, crossed his tale with a courteous kysse, and after began her talke in this order. The wise holde opinion (quoth she) that a present peryll is good to be preuented, who woorkes warely at the first: néede not repent him after, and a bargayne well made, is halfe won. You knowe Brother, our Father requyreth rytches out of measure, and a match of money makes vp his mouth, nowe if <hi>Strabino</hi> should solycite his sute to him (as néedes he must) he may alleadge the want of his wealth, and that his abillitie is not able to maintayne me according to his minde, as no doubt he will compasse a hundred conceyts: because he would match me with olde <hi>Truculento.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To deceyue him now of this deuise, and to winne the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fit for our wyll: I haue bethought of a cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning coniecture, and remembred such a remedy, as will fall verie fyt, bothe that my Father shall giue his consent: and the olde worldly wretch serued in his right kinde. First, Brother you shall goe with <hi>Strabino</hi> to <hi>Truculentes</hi> house, and there on your cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, take vp a great summe of money, as much as you shall thinke good, then go you into <hi>La strada di San Paolo,</hi> and buy the Iewell which my Father hath long had such great affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to, the which will so win him: that I dare warrant none but you shall haue me to his Wife. For the payment therof you shall not néede greatly to accoumpt: for that you shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre vnto me, but this way I thinke you shall soonest spéede, and this way I warrant you shall gayne no nay.</p>
                  <p>I perceyue Syster (quoth <hi>Rodolfo</hi>) a Womans wyt is good at a néede, and this your deuise full well we allowe. Howe say you <hi>Strabino,</hi> shall we put this in practise? Or wyll you deferre it for feare of discredite? Nay sure (quoth <hi>Strabino</hi>)
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:21449:77"/>
since the matter consisteth on no greater a clause, and that this inuencion may driue all out of doubt: I thinke eache day a yéere tyll we haue dispatched it, and eache howre a month tyll we haue bound vp the bargayne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cornelia</hi> espying her Father was entred, and fearing least he would mistrust the matter, gaue them a watche woord to win them away, and to goe about their pretended purpose. <hi>Rodolfo</hi> goes in to flatter his Father, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane whyle <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bino</hi> stealeth out, so that theyr prancks were nothing percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: but all fell out, euen as they would wishe it. <hi>Rodolfo</hi> stealeth out, and followeth his fréend, and in short tyme they met bothe together, then they agréeed how the case should be concluded: if so be the money would be lent that they hoped for.</p>
                  <p>They béeing come to <hi>Signor Truculentos</hi> house, &amp; he sitting at his doore verie solytarie: <hi>Rodolfo</hi> in the fréendlyest fashion saluteth him, and flattering the foole, thus frameth his tale. Woorthy Syr, if I say otherwayes then beseemes me: I hope you wyll beare with me, and if I speake as affection serues me: I doubt not but you wyll déeme all at the best: so that neyther flattering you with any forgerie, nor vpholding my selfe by any vaine glorie: I shall committe to your courtesie my well meaning tale, and my simple sute to be accoumpted of, as you shall lyke best.</p>
                  <p>Since the prouidence of the Gods hath so appointed, law of nature hath eke allowed, and the graue aduise of my Father hath so consented, that you are the only man must matche with my Sister: I reioyce that my hap hath prooued so fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and that the Gods hath sent me such a lucky lot, as your woorthy selfe shall become my brother, alwayes wishing that your tyme may prooue as tranquill, as my good wyll is to woorke your well fare. When olde <hi>Truculento</hi> heard <hi>Rodolfos</hi> Rhetoricke, and how gallantly he glosed to purchase his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, he thinking that all his tale had béene trueth, and vpon pure affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had spoken the same, replyed. Fréend <hi>Rodolfo</hi>: You haue not found me so bountifull: as héereafter you shall find me brotherlike, ne haue you had any such occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:21449:77"/>
me: as héereafter you shall purchase occasion to prayse me. I remayne to pleasure you, in what I can possible, and will stand your fréend in more then I will speake of. Indéede your Father hath found me so fréendly: that I thanke him, he déemes me to deserue his Daughter, &amp; you I sée conceyue so good opinion of me: that you thinke me sufficient to match with your Syster. Well, if all prooue so well, as I hope it will, and the matche be so graunted as on my part it is prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. It is not money, or ought that I haue, but shall be all present to doo you a pleasure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Strabino</hi> began to smyle in his sléeue. <hi>Rodolfo</hi> much a doo to kéepe his countenaunce, to sée the olde whorson how willing he was: &amp; how craftily they caught him into so good a beléefe, wherefore nowe he beginneth to shewe foorth his sute: not doubting to spéede before they departed. Well Syr (quoth <hi>Rodolfo</hi>) for your proffered courtesie I remayne your debtor, not doubting but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter will come so to passe as I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes wished it, &amp; if it lyke you so well, as to graunt me one request: whyle I liue you shall binde me to the vttermost of my power. Héere is a Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a verie déere fréend and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of mine, who because his liuing is not yet come into his handes: is desirous to borrowe a certayne sum of money, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing for the gaynes thereof, what you will demaund: the sum dooth amount to fowre thousand Duckattes, and but for one month he desireth the lending, and if by that tyme he doo not discharge the debt: he is willing to forfayte his patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and besydes the best lym of his body.</p>
                  <p>Fréend <hi>Rodolfo</hi> (quoth <hi>Truculento</hi>) the world is so wretched now a dayes, &amp; diuers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people so pinched by pouerty: that many will borrow, but slack payment is made, then if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the Law to the vttermost: we are accoumpted couetous carles, worldly wretches, and such like, which makes me so lothe to lende: for I care not for dealing in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trade any more. What pleasure were it to me to maime or ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gle this Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for mine owne: truly I had rather if I could well spare so much, to giue it him outright, so should I sustayne no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch my selfe: nor he be endamaged in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> distresse of the law.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:21449:78"/>
Yet for your sake, I care not if I lende him so much: so that you wyll stande bound vnto mée, as straytlie as hée shall.</p>
                  <p>Syr (quoth <hi>Rodolfo</hi>) for the credit of the Gentleman, I dare wage all that I am woorth, and for the payment thereof, I dare stand to the perill, deliuer you the money, &amp; if the debt be not discharged before, or at the aboue named day: I will loose all my Landes, beside the best lym of my body. Well (quoth <hi>Truculento</hi>) this is the bonde, if by the first day of the month ensuing, the whole sum be not restored: eache of your Lands shall stand to the endamagement, besides the losse of bothe your right eyes, are you content to stand to this bargayne? Yea (quoth they bothe) and that right wyllingly.</p>
                  <p>With that he departed to fetche the money, then quoth <hi>Strabino</hi> to his fréende. Dyd euer man see a more extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting villayne then this? Is not our Landes sufficient to glut vp his gréedinesse? But that each of our eyes must stand to the hazard? Oh myserable myser, oh egregrious cormorant, surely the iust iudgement of God, wyll reward him for his wickednesse. Well, cease (quoth <hi>Rodolfo</hi>) no more woordes, <hi>Lupus est in fabula,</hi> little sayd is soone amended.</p>
                  <p>Then comes <hi>Truculento,</hi> wylling them to tell out theyr money, and then to set their handes to his Byll, which béeing doone: he delyuered fortie Duckattes more to <hi>Rodolfo,</hi> to carie his Syster for a token from him, saying. Desire her to estéeme of the gratefulnesse of the gyft, more then the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie dooth amount vnto, and tell her, that in lyfe or death I am hers at commaund.</p>
                  <p>Your courteous token (quoth <hi>Rodolfo</hi>) shall be delyuered, and your message ministred, with as much expedition as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilitie wyll permitte, and thus thanking you a thousand tymes for your Brotherlyke beneuolence. I committe you to the custody of the heauenly Creator. The lyke wishe I you (quoth he) desiring you to remember the bargaine wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you are bound.</p>

                  <head>¶ After that <hi>Rodolfo</hi> and <hi>Strabino</hi> had borrowed the money of Signor Truculento, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to their lodgings, and in the morning goe and buy the ritch Iewell, which Strabino presenteth to Signor Giorolamo Ruscelli, the Father of Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, and obtayneth promise that he shall haue her in marriage. Cap. 6.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Odolfo</hi> in the morning, repayreth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of his assured <hi>Strabino,</hi> where béeing entred, he found him in his study at his Booke, away<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his company to goe about their businesse. <hi>Strabino</hi> (quoth he) let your Bookes a whyle be left: and frame your selfe to furder your fancie, let be the solemnesse you vse in your study: for you are lyke to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase a double delyght, the tyde taryeth no man, and when we are assured of our wished Iewell: then may we deferre y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme as long as we lyst. Wherefore, my selfe desyrous to hasten in our enterprise, and also to prooue the doubt of a dreame. I desire the more to make an ende of this matter. Quoth <hi>Strabino,</hi> hath a dreame driuen you in any such doubt, or haue you séen a fancie in your sléepe, which you shall prooue effectuous now you are waking: if it shall like you to tell me the trueth, I will define thereon as well as I can.</p>
                  <p>To trifle the tyme in talke (quoth <hi>Rodolfo</hi>) may let our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and beside, to shew you the effect of the same: would cause you to delude me, wherefore I will let it alone tyll we returne, and if by the way it prooue to perfection (as my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire is of God it may not) truly I wyll tell you. They take theyr way downe by <hi>Signor Truculentos</hi> doore, where he sawe the Saint sitting which all night was in his vision, no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could he goe he was so faynt, but stoode leaning on the brest of his fréend <hi>Strabino,</hi> at last he burst foorth in these woordes, saying.</p>
                  <p>O my <hi>Strabino,</hi> but that you are my fréend, and one whom
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:21449:79"/>
I doo highly make accoumpt of: I should doubt to discouer the cause of my dollor, and feare to display my so sodayne pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, yet séeing your selfe hath tasted like torment, and haue borne out the bruntes which now I abide: the bolder I may my secretes bewraye, and the surer demonstrate the cause of my care. Yet you will condempne me for my preter presumption, and may rightly controule me for my rashe reprehension: yet iudge with indifferencie, and deale with me fréendly, let olde faultes be forgotten, and penaunce clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me pardon. I sée there is no stomacke so stoute: but looue will allay it, no courage so conquerous: but looue will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince it, nor no heart so hautie: but looue can bring lowe: Euen so my selfe, who was a reiecter of looue, am now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to followe my fancie, and I who enuied against Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men kinde: am now become a thrall to one my selfe.</p>
                  <p>With that for feare of béeing suspected in the open stréete: they went theyr wayes about theyr other affayres, and as they were walking, quoth <hi>Strabino.</hi> I sée déere fréende, that the most learned Clarkes, are not the wisest, the most valiaunt, not the surest, nor the greatest boasters, the best perfourmers, I perceyue you would haue béene in your deskant, before you knewe what pertayned to pricke Song. What say you nowe to <hi>Plautus</hi> woordes? What say you to all the matters wherewith you charged me? Well, I will not replye so rashlie as you dyd: nor I will not giue you such colde comfort, as you vsed to me, but I wyll doo the best to make vp the matter, and my head to a halfepeny, I wyll bring it to effect.</p>
                  <p>I knowe it is <hi>Truculentos</hi> Daughter whome you desire, and she it is must cease your sorrowes: let vs first ende the matter we haue in hande, and then you shall sée how I wyll compasse this géere. <hi>Rodolfo</hi> well satisfied with <hi>Strabinos</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise: went and bought the Iewell which his Father so much desired, and there withall a fayre white Iennet of <hi>Spayne,</hi> and comming home: found his Father sitting at the doore, he entred, leauing <hi>Strabino</hi> to talke with him, who after he had saluted him in séemely sort: beganne his matters in
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:21449:79"/>
this order as followeth.</p>
                  <p>To rip vp the chéefe occasions (woorthy Sir) that procureth me in what I can to pleasure you: would be ouer tedious to me in the telling, and somewhat troublesome to you in the hearing, wherefore letting them passe as remembred in minde, and recounting such matters as occasion dooth byd me: I first and formost present you with this rytch &amp; sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Iewell, wishing it so much woorth, as I could wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly bestowe.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Signor Ruscelli</hi> sawe the Iewell, which so long he desired, and that his sonnes fréend and Companion was the bestower of the same: he was ouercome with such excéeding ioy: that it is vnpossible for me to expresse. But when he had well viewed all about, &amp; séene the sumptuousnesse bestowed thereon: he aunswered <hi>Strabino</hi> to his great contentment.</p>
                  <p>If I should shew you (quoth he) how much this gyft plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth me, and besides, make manifest the good wyll I beare you: you would suppose I dyd but flatter you, and déeme my woordes of no true intent. Wherefore to driue you out of all such doubtes, and to make apparaunce of that I haue spoken: demaund of me what you shall déeme expedient, and I vow to the vttermost to graunt your request.</p>
                  <p>With that <hi>Cornelia</hi> came to the doore, and séeing the Iewel in her Fathers hande: commended greatly the lyberalitie of her Brothers fréende, and informing her Father to make him large amendes.</p>
                  <p>Syr (quoth <hi>Strabino</hi>) the Iewell giuen, byds me (vnder ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite of your lycence) craue an other Iewell, and this Ien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net besides I giue you, wishing but to spéede of that Iewell. What Iewell soeuer it be (quoth he) I haue, or any other thing, that may séeme to suffice you: on my credite and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, you can but aske and haue. <hi>Strabino</hi> stepped vp and tooke <hi>Cornelia</hi> by the hand, saying: then giue me this Iewell in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of my Iewell: so shall I be contented, and you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing iniured.</p>
                  <p>Syr <hi>Strabino</hi> (quoth <hi>Signor Ruscelli</hi>) the demaund you haue made is doubtfull, and the choyse you haue chosen, nothing
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:21449:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
correspondent to mine intent, her mariage is already made, and she is giuen to one whose wealth is so woorthy, &amp; whose store so surpassing: that whyle she liueth, she shall néede to lacke nothing. You are a young Gentleman, youthfull and lyberall, and will spend more in a day: then he in a yéere, he is warie and wise, you youthfull and prodigall, therefore the matche is otherwise determined, any thing else remayneth at your request. Syr (quoth <hi>Strabino</hi>) you haue left a poynt open, and I haue a man to enter, respect your play wisely, least you loose the game outright. A promise may alwayes be claymed for a due debt, and such a man as you should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer shrinke at his woord, I may clayme this Iewell by a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient tytle: for that in your promise you made no exception. Yea but <hi>Strabino</hi> (quoth he) I meant you should haue desired some other desert. But I meant (quoth <hi>Strabino</hi>) to craue none other, so that you standing to the bargaine, and I lyber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to take what best lykes me: this Iewell is mine, and your woorde a sufficient warrant.</p>
                  <p>Besides, where you doubt my liuing is not sufficient to welcome such a Wife: I trust that the patrimony my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes dooth allowe me, is more then the dowrie you wyll make to her mariage. Againe, if my lyberalitie, of you be dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyked, and the niggardly sparing of a worldly wretch so much commended: I perceyue you preferre rytches before a noble minde, and accoumpt more of vanitie, then you doo of vertue. <hi>Mazeus</hi> when he receyued his <hi>Pretorship</hi> of <hi>Alexander</hi>: in commendation of his munificence, vsed these woordes. My Prince <hi>Darius</hi> was euer but one man: but thou by thy lyberalitie, makest many <hi>Alexanders. Scipio Africanus</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer rode abroade, but he would vse such lyberalitie ere he returned: that of his greatest fooes, he would make his dée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest fréends. <hi>Isocrates</hi> wysheth <hi>Nicocles</hi> to be familliar with this excellent vertue, wylling him in his apparell to be gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and glorious: and let his lyberalitie set foorth his mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence. Then neuer disprayse lyberalitie, which is the chéefe ornament of a noble minde: but hate that worldly pleasure, enemie to all vertuous actions. I content my selfe
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:21449:80"/>
to stand to her gentle iudgement, if she doo not regard me: I am content you shall refuse me, and if she lyke me not: I will let her alone.</p>
                  <p>What bargayne is betwéene you twayne (quoth <hi>Signor Ruscelli</hi>) I knowe not, nor how you haue deuised the matter in hope to deceyue me, yet haue I séene no such familliarity, whereof I should accoumpt: nor any such likelyhood, that she will chuse you to her Husband. I am content to abyde her agréement, wherefore speake Daughter as your minde shall best serue you.</p>
                  <p>Then since déere Father (quoth <hi>Cornelia</hi>) it hath lyked you to graunt me my minde, in making my choyse, and that you will not be offended at my bolde behauiour: Syr <hi>Strabino,</hi> you are the man whome I most accoumpt of, and no other will I haue during lyfe.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Signor Ruscelli</hi> perceyued it was come to that passe, and that his promise bound him to stand to her verdict: he sayd. Take héere then <hi>Strabino,</hi> the Iewell of my ioy, to quite your Iewell so lyberallie bestowed, and God graunt you such prosperitie whyle you liue together: as I wishe to mine owne soule, I speake vnfaynedly. The Nuptialles shall be celebrated when you thinke best, in the meane while I will take you as my Sonne, and you bothe as Man and Wife.</p>
                  <p>After much talke passed betwéene them: out commeth the mournfull <hi>Rodolfo,</hi> rauished with such inward desyre, and tossed in such frantick fittes: as his pittious plight bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the state of his sicknesse. <hi>Strabino</hi> taking leaue of his new found Father, and of his swéet Lady and wife <hi>Cornelia</hi>: went with him. And as they were going (quoth <hi>Rodolfo.</hi>) O my déere <hi>Strabino,</hi> néedes must I goe, to knowe eyther of or on, her Father shall knowe the good will I beare her, and she shall perceyue I wishe her to my Wife. If I maye spéede, I haue my desire, if not, the greater wyll be my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse.</p>
                  <p>Ah Syr (quoth <hi>Strabino</hi>) how lyke you looue? Who shall controule you for following your fancie? A man knowes

what his beginning is: but he knoweth not his ending. Brag is a good Dogge, whyle he will holde out: but at last he may chaunce to méete with his matche. In such like conference they came to the house of <hi>Signor Truculento,</hi> and who should open the doore but <hi>Brisana</hi> his Daughter, the Mistresse of <hi>Rodolfo,</hi> whome he saluted in very fréendly sort. But euen so willing as he was to haue her to his Wife: she was as desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to haue him to her Husbande. Héere was hote looue on bothe sides, and each of them so farre in: that it was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for eyther to gette out. <hi>Rodolfo,</hi> he in secrete telles <hi>Truculento</hi> such a flattering tale in his eare, howe his Sister had calmed her courage, and was content to stand to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers appointment: that the day after the debt was dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the mariage should be made, so he for ioy of these new-come tydinges: ioyneth them bothe hand in hand, to marie when they will, &amp; God giue them much ioy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Heere were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages soone made, and Wiues soone wonne, I beléeue if I should sue for lyke succour: I should perforce take longer space to spéede.</p>
                  <p>Nowe is <hi>Rodolfo</hi> returned reioysing, and <hi>Strabino</hi> right glad of his good successe, <hi>Truculento</hi> presently hyes him to horsebacke, to goe wyll all his fréendes, to méete at his mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Signor Ruscelli</hi> knew how his sonne had spedde, and by so fine a drift had deceyued <hi>Truculento</hi>: the next morning marieth his sonne, and <hi>Truculentos</hi> Daughter together, and <hi>Cornelia</hi> and <hi>Strabino</hi> in the selfe same sort. What ioy was héere on eyther side: iudge you that are maried folkes and meddle in such matters, yet though I be vnskilfull to define on such clauses: I must néedes suppose, that since each of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gayned, the thing which they most desired: their ioy was not lyttle, nor their pleasure lightly to be accoumpted of.</p>

                  <p>But now Gentlemen (as the auncient Prouerbe is) after pleasure comes payne, and after mirth comes myserie, and

after a fayre and sunny day, ariseth blustring windes &amp; sharp showers: Euen so to this passed pageant of pleasure, is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed a stratageme of sorrowes.</p>

                     <hi>Truculento</hi> is returned from bydding his Guestes, and hath heard of the hap which chaunced in his absence, he comes as one bereft of his wyttes, or as a man feared out of his fiue sences, and vttereth this tale to <hi>Signor Giorolamo Ruscelli.</hi> Syr, blame not my boldnesse, for that I am constrayned, nor reprehend my rashnesse, since I am so misused, I thought more credite had consisted in your auncient heart, and that you would not haue dissembled with any such double dealing. Dyd not you perfectly promise I should matche with your Daughter, and that no one should gayne her but only I? Did not I giue your Sonne my Daughter on the selfe same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? And haue you in my absence maryed her to an other? Not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented with matching my Daughter with your Son, I béeing not present<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to goe and play such a Parasites part. Well, well, I doubt not but to deale so sharply with some: that they shall wishe they neuer had maried my promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed wife.</p>

Wherfore you must pacifie your selfe, there is no other remedy, and learne to make a vertue of necessity, for sure your lucke was still turned to losse. And whereas my Sonne hath matched with your Daughter: I déeme you are not greatly to finde any fault, but rather may be glad she hath sped so well, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day hath béene he might haue had her betters. Wherfore if you séeme to chafe your selfe vpon so lyght occasion, and that you will not be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented, we offering you such courtesy: meddle in no more matters then you may, nor heape any more harmes on your head, then you are wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to beare.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost magnificent Iudge, tyme was (quoth <hi>Truculento</hi>) when firme affection, and pure zeale of fréendshippe, mooued me to minde the destitute estate of these two Gentlemen, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as either they had not money to their content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: or wanted such necessaries, as then was to them néedefull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> At which tyme (as the Lambe endaungered by the rauenous Woolfe, flyeth for sauegard to his folde, or as the Ship abiding the hazard of Fortune, and fearing the emmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent daunger, posteth to some Porte, or hasteth to some Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in hope of succour): Euen so these twayne repayred to me, who béeing sufficiently stored of that which they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and besides, willing to pleasure them, to their greater profite: committed to their custody, a certayne summe of money, which amounteth vnto fowre thousand Crownes.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:21449:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Nowe theyr necessite indifferently satisfied, and they béeing bound to delyuer the summe at a certayne daye: they haue broken theyr promise, which is open periurie, and falsyfied theyr faythes, in not restoring the money. Wherefore, that all Gentlemen may be warned by such wylfull offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and that God may be glorified in putting them to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment: I haue thus determined how the debt shall be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged. The rendring of the money I doo not accoumpt of, ne wyll I be pleased with twise as much restored: the breach of the Lawe I meane to exact, and to vse rygor, where it is so required.</p>
                  <p>The forfayture of theyr Landes, is the one part of the penaltie, the losse of theyr right eyes the whole ingenerall, now remembring the wofull estate of theyr solitarie wiues, how in depriuing theyr substaunce, they might be pinched by penurie: I let theyr Landes remayne vnto them in full possession, whereon héereafter they may liue more honestly. I clayme theyr right eyes for falsifying theyr faith: to mooue others regard howe they make lyke rechlesse promises. So shall Iustice be ministred without partialytie, they rightly serued for infringing theyr fidelity: and my selfe not thought to deale with crueltie.</p>
                  <p>Thus haue you heard the cause of my comming: now giue iudgement as your wisedome shall thinke most expedient. My fréends (quoth the Iudge) héere is no place to deale with partialitie, héere is no roome where falsehood should be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented, nor time in this place to deferre in trifling affayres: but héere is simply Iustice to be aduaunced, wrong righly reuenged, and mercie mildly maintayned. Wherfore, ere I beginne to deale in this diuersitie, or that I séeme to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend about this controuersie: I exhort you each one to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt double dealing, to flye forged fraude, &amp; to minister no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing malitiously, but on each cause to way the matter adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly. Consider you come to deale in matters of conscience, matters of your owne mayntenaunce, and such thinges whereon your credite consisteth, now you are not for fréend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe to further falsehood, ne yet for malice to touch an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trueth,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:21449:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but euen to deale so directly, to frame your matters so faithfully, and to vse your selues héere so vprightly: that not so much as a motion be made of any misorder. But euery one to aunswere as occasion is offered, so helpe you God and the contentes of this booke, wherat they all kissed the booke. And then the Iudge called <hi>Strabino,</hi> to shewe in what sort, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what order the money was borrowed, and what promise there was betwéene them.</p>
                  <p>Most mightie Iudge (quoth <hi>Strabino</hi>) trueth neuer defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth his Maister, right repelleth all proffered wrong, and vpright dealing disdayneth all forged fraude, wherefore, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fearing the force of his reuenging rigor, nor yet dismay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at ought that is doone: I will tell my tale, reporting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but trueth, and clayming no other courtesie then my desertes shall deserue.</p>
                  <p>Trueth is, my Father fayling to send me such money, as serued to the mayntenaunce of my studious exercise, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, wanting wherewith to deale in waighty affayres: my fréend &amp; I came vnto this Caterpyller, (so rightly may I call him, neyther defacing his lycentious lyuing, condempning his practised science, and cunning handy craft, nor yet inuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against any of his honest behauiour: but commending his cut throate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions, in pinching the poore, to fyl vp his own poutch.) Béeing come to this aforesayd woorme of the world, (who eateth so many to the bare bones, out of Lands and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, to glut his gréedy desire) we desired a certayne summe of money, which is no lesse then him selfe hath confessed, for a monthes space, and then to restore the same to the vnright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full owner, who binding vs straytly in the losse of our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and of each our right eyes: lent vs this aforesayd sum. Now in déede, we not minding the so short restoring of his due debt, for that necessary occasions was partly our hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce: haue indamaged our selues in two dayes more, then the limmited time did amount vnto, for which time we will allow him to the vttermost he can aske, &amp; his money to haue when him pleaseth. Now if your wisdome dooth not thinke we deale with him honestly and well: we will stand to what
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:21449:83"/>
effect it shall like you to bring it.</p>
                  <p>My fréend (quoth the Iudge) your reply is reasonable, you confesse your selfe indebted in that which he hath demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, and yéeld that you haue broken the band, wylling to make an amends, insomuch that you will satisfie the vttermost, which he may séeme to sue for: I can not chuse but accoumpt your woordes of good credite, in that your dealing dooth demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strate no other. Now <hi>Truculento,</hi> you sée the Gentleman grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth him selfe guilty, since his earnest affayres dyd hinder the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment of your debt to you due, now he hath the whole rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to restore, and beside, ouer &amp; aboue this sum: will content you to the vttermost it shall please you to request. In my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion you can reasonably require no more, if you doo: you shall but séeme to shame your selfe.</p>
                  <p>Syr (quoth <hi>Truculento</hi>) he that before my face will vse such terrible tauntes, behinde my backe, would gladly brew my bane, he that in my presence will so spightfully reprooue me: in my absence would hang me if it were in his possibilitie. Dooth he demerit fauour: that so frowneth on his fréend? Can he clayme any courtesie: that abuseth him selfe so disorderly? Or can he once pleade for pittie: that standeth in so great a presumption? Or you my Lord, desire me deale gently: with one who respecteth not gentillitie? No, the money is none of mine, ne will I haue it, his Landes I respect not, ne care I for them, and now his submission I way not, ne will I accept of it. You my Lord shall rather reape reproche by pleading on his part: then gayne any credite in maintayning so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse a creature. I driue my whole action to this issue, I plead my priuiledge vnto this poynt, &amp; to this clause I am seuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bent: I will haue the due which breach of promise dooth deserue, I will exempt all courtesie: and accoumpt of cruelty, I wyll be pleased with no ritch reward whatsoeuer, no pitty shall preuayle, rigor shall rule, and on them bothe I will haue Lawe to the vttermost.</p>
                  <p>Why <hi>Truculento</hi> (quoth the Iudge) respect you cruelty: more then Christian ciuillitie, regard you rigor more then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Should the God aboue all Gods, the Iudge aboue all
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:21449:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Iudges, administer desert, which your sinnes hath deserued? If his fatherly affection, if his mercifull myldnesse, if his righteous regard, dyd not consider the frayltie of your fleshe, your promptnes vnto peryll, and your aptnes vnto euyll: how mightie were the myserie, which should iustly fall vpon you? Howe sharpe the sentence that should be pronounced against you, and howe rigorous the reuenge, which should rightly reward you? Is this the looue you beare to your brother? Is this the care you haue of a Christian? The <hi>Turke,</hi> whose tyranny is not to be talked of: could but exact to the vttermost of his crueltie. And you a braunche of that blessed body, which bare the burden of our manifolde sinnes: howe can you seeme to deale so sharply with your selfe? sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you should vse to all men: as you would be dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Yet to let you haue the lybertie of your demaund in Lawe, and you to stand to the Iustice which héere I shall pronounce, let first your right eye be put foorth in theyr pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence: and then shall they bothe abide lyke punishment.</p>
                  <p>For since neyther the restoring of your debt wyll suffice you, nor yet the lyberall amendes they are content to make you: I déeme it expedient you should be pertaker of theyr paynes, so shall you knowe if you demaund a reasonable request. Howe say you, will you stand to the verdict pronounced: or take the rewarde which they haue promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
                  <p>My Lord (quoth <hi>Truculento</hi>) neyther doo I deserue to abide any such doome, nor they woorthy to be fauoured with any such fréendshippe, I may lawfully alleadge that you permit partiality: &amp; that you deuide not each cause indifferently, for to what ende should you séeme to satisfie me with their woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: when your selfe perceyues how they are found faultie? And what vrgeth you to vse such gentle perswasions: when you sée your selfe they deserue no such dealing? If I had wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully offended in any such cause, and wyttingly broken in such sort my bonde: I would be contented you should deliuer me my deserts, so that you dyd minister nothing but Iustice. And wherefore should you séeme to demaund the losse of my
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:21449:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
eye who haue not offended: for sauegarde of their eyes that haue so trecherously trespassed? I am sure I go not beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the breache of my bande, nor I desire no more then they haue deserued. Wherefore obiect no more matters, whereby to delude me, nor impute no occasions to hinder my pretence, I craue Iustice to be vprightly vsed, and I craue no more, wherefore I will haue it.</p>
                  <p>Indéede my fréends (quoth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudge) who séeketh the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, &amp; vrgeth so much as his wilfull minde dooth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him: his commission is very large, &amp; his request not to be refused. Wherfore, since neither pittie can preuaile, nor fréendly cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayle perswade: you must render the raunsome that he dooth require, for we cannot debarre him in these his dealings, nor we can not chuse but giue our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sentes. Therfore if you haue any that will pleade your case in Law: let them speake &amp; they shall be heard, to further your safety as much as we may.</p>
                  <p>My Lord (quoth <hi>Rodolfo</hi>) theyr courtesie is ouermuch that will knéele to a Thystle, and theyr beneuolence bountifull that will bowe to a Bramble: Euen so we are farre foolishe to craue courtesie of such a cut throate, and more wytlesse then wyse to meddle with such a wordly wretch. If there be no remedy: we knowe the vttermost of our paynes, yet we craue that these our Attorneyes, may haue such lybertie as Lawe will permit.</p>
                  <p>With that <hi>Truculento</hi> fared like a fiend, and curssed and banned like a Diuell of hell, (quoth he) my Lord, you deale with me discourteously: when the Lawe is come to the passe to let them haue theyr Attorneyes.</p>
                  <p>Syr (quoth the Iudge) you haue vsed all this whyle your Attorneyes aduise, and they haue aunswered simply of them selues, now since you the Plaintife haue had this preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue: it is reason the Defendaunts should demaund their due. It may be that their Attorneyes may put you to such a plundge: that you shall haue small occasion to bragge of your bargayne: wherefore let them speake.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Brisana</hi> (<hi>Truculentos</hi> Daughter) began in this order to pleade for her auayle. Admit my Lord (quoth she) that I
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:21449:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
come to such a person as this partie, to borrow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyke sum of money, binding me in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> selfe same band, to restore the money to the same party of whome I had it. Well, the time expyred, I come to deliuer the due to the owner, he being not at home, nor in the Citty, but ridden foorth, and vncertaine of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: I returne home to my house, and he him selfe comes out of the Countrey as yesterday. Now he vpon some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall spight or malicious intent: sueth me in the Lawe, not demaunding his due, nor I knowing of his ariuall. Am I to be condempned for breaking the Lawe: when the partie him selfe hath deferred the day?</p>
                  <p>How lyke you this géere <hi>Truculento</hi>? you haue now an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pigeon to pull, and héere is one wiser then you were beware. Can you condempne this partie, not demaunding your due, nor béeing at home when it might haue béene dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged? And making the bande to be restored to your selfe?</p>
                  <p>My Lord (quoth <hi>Truculento</hi>) though I was not at home: my house was not emptie, and though I was away, if it had béene restored: it stoode in as good effect as if it had béene payd to me. Wherefore it is but follie to frame such an alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation: for my Receyuer in my absence dooth represent my selfe.</p>
                  <p>Well (quoth <hi>Brisana</hi>) admit your seruaunt in your absence, standeth in as full effect as your selfe, and admit the debt had béene discharged to him, if wylfulnesse had allured your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt to wandering, and that he had departed with the debt he receyued: you returne and finde it styll in your booke, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther marked nor crossed, as if payment had not béene made, you wyll let your seruaunt slyp with his offence: but you wyll demaund the debt agayne of me.</p>
                  <p>Tush (quoth <hi>Truculento</hi>) this is but a tryfle, and your woordes are now to be estéemed as winde, you should haue restored the summe to my seruaunt: and I would not haue troubled you in any such sort, for there is no man that vseth such follie: but he will sée the booke crossed before he depart. Therefore you doo but trouble tyme with mentioning such matters: for your redemption is neuer the néere.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:21449:85"/>Well then Syr (quoth she) you will thus much allow, that at the deliuery: the bande should be restored, and if I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuered the money to your seruaunt: I should haue respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my bande tyll yesterday, for your seruaunt had it not to delyuer: and I would not pay it before I had my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In déede I confesse (quoth he) my Cubborde kept the bande tyll I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, but yet noting the receyt in the booke, would haue béene sufficient tyll my comming home.</p>
                  <p>With that <hi>Cornelia</hi> stepped vp, saying. Since <hi>(Signor Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culento)</hi> you will neyther allowe the reasonable aunsweres he hath made, nor be content to abide my Lord the Iudges verdict: receyue the raunsome you so much require, and take bothe their eyes, so shall the matter be ended. But thus much (vnder verdict of my Lord his lycence) I giue you in charge, and also especially notifie, that no man but your selfe shall execute the déede, ne shall you craue any counsayle of any the standers by. If in pulling foorth their eyes, you dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe the least quantitie of blood out of their heads, ouer and besides their only eyes, or spyll one drop in taking them out: before you styrre your foote, you shall stand to the losse of bothe your owne eyes. For that the bande maketh mention of nothing but their eyes, and so if you take more then you should, and lesse then you ought: you shall abide the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment héere in place pronounced. Nowe take when you will, but beware of the bargayne.</p>
                  <p>Truly (quoth the Iudge) this matter hath béene excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled, it is no reason if you haue your bargayne: that you should hinder them with the losse of one droppe of blood, wherefore I pronounce no other Iudgement, shall at this tyme be ministred.</p>
                  <p>Now was <hi>Truculento</hi> more mad that he could not haue his hearts desire, for that he knewe he must néedes spyll some blood, it could not be otherwyse chosen, wherefore he desired he might haue his money, and so let all other matters alone.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:21449:86"/>
Nay (quoth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudge) since you would not accept of it when it was offered, nor would be contented with so large a promise: the money shall serue to make them amendes, for the great wrong which you would haue offered. Thus in my opinion is Iudgement equally vsed, and neyther partie I hope will be miscontented.</p>
