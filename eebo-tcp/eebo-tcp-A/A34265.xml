            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:53303:8"/>It is true, that in <hi>China,</hi> Sacrifices have ever been offer'd to diverse Tutelary Angels: But in the times which preceeded <hi>Confucius,</hi> 'twas in Respect of Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them infinitely less than <hi>Xam-ti,</hi> the Souveraign Lord of the World.</p>
            <p>The Chineses serv'd God with Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Pomp and Magnificence, but at the same time, with a very modest and very humble Behaviour; and said, That all this external Worship was in no wise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Divinity, if the Soul was not inwardly Adorn'd with Piety and Virtue.

               </head>
               <p>ALthough in this little Work our Design is only to relate what is most Remarkable in <hi>Confucius</hi>'s Books, yet we are obliged to speak of some Books which have appear'd in <hi>China</hi> before this Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher. But this being not to be
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53303:10"/>
done without reflecting a little back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, we will discourse one word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Origen and Antiquity of the <hi>Chineses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Chinese</hi> Chronologers do almost all agree, that <hi>Fohi,</hi> who began to reign 2952 Years before the Birth of Jesus Christ, was the Founder of this Monarchy. The <hi>Chineses</hi> that have interpreted these Annals, make no difficulty to avow, that whatever is writ concerning <hi>China,</hi> before the Reign of this Emperor, is fabulous and suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: and one of their most renown'd Historians, named <hi>Taisucum,</hi> frankly confesses, that he is ignorant of what passed before the Reign of <hi>Xinum,</hi> the Successor of <hi>Fohi.</hi> There are only certain Annals which the <hi>Chineses</hi> call the <hi>Great Annals,</hi> wherein the thing is otherwise read. The Author of this Prodigious Chronology, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains almost an Hundred and fifty Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, reports that after the Creation of the World, there were three Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors: The one of Heaven, the other of the Earth, and the third of Men;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53303:10"/>
That the Progeny of this last suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded one another for the space of above Forty nine thousand Years; after which, Thirty five Imperial Families do successively Reign for several Ages without Interruption. This Author likewise adds, That he justifies not what he says, and at last agrees, that it is more certain to begin with <hi>Fohi,</hi> and herein to follow the most famous and best reputed Historians.</p>
               <p>'Tis not that in <hi>Fohi</hi>'s Life they have not inserted an infinite Number of Fables, which might cause us to question whether this Emperor ever was; For besides that in the <hi>Great Annals</hi> it is read, that <hi>Fohi</hi>'s Mother accidentally stepping into a Place where a Giant had passed, she was suddenly encompass'd with a Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, and that 'twas at this very moment, that she perceiv'd her self with Child of the Founder of the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nese</hi> Monarchy: where it is also rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that this Founder had the Head of a Man, and Body of a Serpent. 'Tis true, that these Fables being very gross,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53303:11"/>
the Generality of the <hi>Chineses</hi> derides them. They report, that the Ground of this Ridiculous Tradition was the Colour of <hi>Fohi</hi>'s Body, which was marked with several spots; or rather, that it was an Hieroglyphick, whereby they intended to represent this Prince, as a Prince of extraordinary Prudence. But although we had not this Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and Prospect, the Genealogy of this King is so exact, so circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial, and so well prosecuted in the Chronological Tables of the <hi>Chineses,</hi> that it is not possible to imagine it only a Fancy; so that there is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as little reason to deny, or even to question that <hi>Fohi</hi> ever was, as to maintain that <hi>Saturn, Iupiter, Hercules</hi> and <hi>Romulus</hi> are only Names, under pretence that the Poets and gravest Historians have intermixt the History of their Birth with a Thousand imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Fables.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, these very Annals, which contain so many Fables upon the Account of <hi>Fohi</hi>'s Birth, do say nothing of his Predecessor's, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53303:11"/>
do speak very imperfectly concerning his Country; which makes us suspect that he was not Born in <hi>China,</hi> and that he came thither from some other place. They only intimate, that he was Born in a Province called <hi>Kensi,</hi> where he indeed must necessarily ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive, supposing that he came from some other Part into <hi>China:</hi> For after the Confusion of Tongu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rt.</p>
               <p>Although we cannot exactly know at what time <hi>Fohi</hi> laid the first Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of his Empire, yet it is very probable that it was not long after the Deluge: For indeed, if we vigorously follow the Computations of the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses,</hi> and Chronology of the <hi>Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint,</hi> 'twas not till about 200 Years after, in a time when <hi>Noah</hi> was yet living; so that we may readily believe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53303:12"/>
that he is descended from this Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch by <hi>Sem,</hi> who according to the Sentiment of the whole World, had <hi>Asia</hi> for his Inheritance. And that which more confirms us in our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is, that in the <hi>Chinese</hi> Language, <hi>Sem,</hi> which signifies to ingender and produce, imports also Life and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Indeed, 'tis from <hi>Noah</hi>'s Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that all Men since the Deluge are descended, and have received Life, and have learn't to offer Sacrifice unto God. Whereunto it might be added, that <hi>Fohi</hi> is by the <hi>Chineses</hi> called <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the more through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to convince us of what we have been discoursing, it is needful only to consider the Doctrine, Sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Books which the Ancient <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses</hi> have writ, are exceeding nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but the chief are those which are called <hi>Vkim</hi>; that is to say, The five Volumes, and those intituled

which respect Hospitality, and those which are necessary to be perform'd at home, or abroad, or at Feasts. He there discourses likewise of the Vessels of the Sacrifices, of the Victims that were to be offer'd up unto Heaven, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They explain and more clearly illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate what is writ in the five Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes: and although the Authority of the five Volumes be infinitely greater, by reason of their Antiquity,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53303:17"/>
than that of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>our Volumes, yet the four Volumes exceed it, for the Advantage that may be receiv'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. Indeed, besides that the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses</hi> do thence derive their Principal Oracles, and what they believe to be eternal Verities; The <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They are, in truth, under an Obligation, to know one of the five Volumes, which they please to choose, according to their Fancy and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But as for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>our Books, they are indispensably oblig'd to know them all four by heart, and throughly to understand them; The principal Reasons of which are as follow: The first is, That <hi>Confucius</hi> and <hi>Memcius,</hi> who writ the fourth Book, have Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected what is best and most exquisite in the Works of the Ancients. The
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53303:18"/>
second is, That they have added seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good things to the Discoveries and Thoughts of their Ancestors. The third, That <hi>Confucius</hi> and <hi>Memcius</hi> propose their Doctrine after a clearer and politer Method than was formerly done. In fine, 'tis because that <hi>Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> and <hi>Memcius</hi> have, in the four Books, avoided the dull and harsh style of the Ancients, and that by a smooth style, although without Pride and Arrogancy, they have added Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments to the naked Simplicity of the Golden Age.</p>
               <p>We have nothing to say concerning the Fourth Book, because that this Work of <hi>Memcius</hi> has not as yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in <hi>Europe</hi>: but before we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to speak of <hi>Confucius,</hi> it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to publish the Merit of this Philosopher, together with the most remarkable Passages of his Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Confucius</hi> was Born 551 Years before the coming of Jesus Christ. He was of a most Noble Extraction; for, not to mention his Mother, who was of an Illustrious Birth, his Father, who
<pb facs="tcp:53303:18"/>
had been advanc'd to the first and chiefest Offices of the Empire, was descended from the last Emperor of the second Family.</p>
               <p>Dispositions to Virtue appearing sometimes in the tenderest Years, <hi>Confucius,</hi> at six Years old discovered nothing of a Child: All his ways were Manly.</p>
               <p>At the Age of Fifteen Years, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd himself to the Reading of the Ancients, and having selected those which were most esteemed, and which himself judg'd the best, he thence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the most excellent Instructions, with a design first to profit himself, thereby to make them the Rules of his own Conduct, and afterwards to propose them to others. At Twenty Years old he Married, and had a Son named <hi>Peyu,</hi> who died at Fifty. He was the only Child he had, but his Race extinguish'd not, he had a Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son called <hi>Cusu,</hi> that was an Honour to his Ancestors. <hi>Cusu</hi> apply'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to Philosophy, he made Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries on his Grandfather's Books, was
<pb facs="tcp:53303:19"/>
advanc'd to the highest Dignities, and his House is so well supported, and his Posterity have always been so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable both for their Promotions and Opulency, that this Family is at present one of the most Illustrious in <hi>China.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Confucius</hi> exercis'd the Magistracy at divers places with very good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, and with a great Reputation; His greatest Aim being the Publick Good, and the Propagation of his Doctrine, he ambiciously sought not after Vain-glory in these sorts of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys. Insomuch, that when he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish'd not his end, when he saw himself frustrated in the hopes he had of being enabled more easily to diffuse his Lights, from an high Place, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended and renounc'd the Office of a Magistrate.</p>
               <p>This Philosopher had Three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Disciples, among which, there were Five hundred that manag'd the most Eminent Charges in several Kingdoms, and Seventy two whose Virtue a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d Knowledge was so extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53303:19"/>
that the Annals have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd their Names, Sirnames, and the Names of their Country to Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. He divided his Doctrine into four Parts; so that <hi>Confucius</hi>'s School was compos'd of four Orders of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Those of the first Order applied themselves to cultivate Virtue, and thereby to impress strong Dispositions in their Heart and Mind. Those of the second Order addicted themselves to the Art of Ratiocination and Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick. The third studied Politicks. And the Business and Employment of the fourth Order, was to write in a smooth and neat style, what concern'd Morality. Amongst these Seventy two Disciples, there were Ten that signalized themselves, and whose Names and Wri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ings are in great Veneration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Confucius,</hi> throughout his Doctrine, had no other intent than to dissipate the Mists of the Mind, to extirpate Vice, and re-establish that Integrity which he affirm'd to have been a Present from Heaven. And the more
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53303:20"/>
easily to attain this end, he exhorted all those that heard his Instructions, to obey Heaven, to fear and serve it, to love his Neighbour as himself, to conquer and submit his Passions unto Reason, to do nothing, say nothing, nor think nothing contrary to it. And what was more remarkable, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended nothing to others, either in Writing or by word of Mouth, which he did not first practise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. His Disciples also had for him a Veneration so extraordinary, that they sometimes made no scruple to pay him those Honors, which were us'd to be render'd to those only that sat upon the Throne: An Example of which we will give you. 'Twas an Ancient Custom amongst the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses,</hi> to place Sick Persons Beds on the North-side: but because that this situation was the situation of the King's Beds; when a King visited a Sick Person, the Bed was removed to the South-side, and 'twas a Crime not to do it. <hi>Confucius</hi> had some Disciples, that, in their Sicknesses,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53303:20"/>
render'd him such an Homage. We must not here forget one very remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Thing which the <hi>Chineses</hi> relate. They report that <hi>Confucius</hi> was us'd continually to say, <hi>That the Holy Man was in the West.</hi> Whatever his Thoughts were, it is certain that Sixty and five Years after Christ's Birth, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Mimti,</hi> excited by the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher's words, and much more, as it is said, by the Image of the Holy Hero that appeared to him in a Dream, sent two Ambassadors into the West, there to find out the <hi>Saint and Holy Law.</hi> But these Ambassadors Landing at a certain Island not far from the Red-Sea, and not daring to venture farther, they advised about taking a certain Idol they found there, which was the Statue of a Philosopher cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Foe Kiao,</hi> that had appear'd in the <hi>Indies,</hi> about Five hundred Years before <hi>Confucius,</hi> and brought into <hi>China Fohi</hi>'s Idol with the Doctrine which he had Taught. Happy had been their Embassy, if instead of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine they had returned into their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53303:21"/>
own Country with the saving Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Jesus Christ, which St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> then Preach'd in the <hi>Indi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From this unhappy time, the Generality of the <hi>Chineses</hi> have follow'd after Idols; and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition and Idolatry, daily, making new Progress, they by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle forsook the Doctrine of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, have neglected the excellent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions of the Ancients, and in fine, being grown Contemners of all sorts of Religion, they are faln headlong into Atheism.

Never was a good Father more regretted by dutiful and well-bred Children, than <hi>Confucius</hi> was by his Disciples.

making his Doctrine savoury to many. He was severer to himself than others. He had a continual Circumspection over himself, and was a rigid Censurer of his own Conduct.

In fine, he had one Virtue rarely found in great Men, <hi>viz.</hi> Humility: for he not only spake with an extreme Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty of himself, and what concern'd him, but he with a singular sincerity declar'd to the whole World, that he ceased not to learn, and that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine he taught was not his own, but the Doctrine of the Ancients But his Books are his true Pourtraicture, which in this place we proceed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to view.</p>

what manner the Ancient Kings go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned themselves.</p>
                  <p>That they might at last govern their Empire wisely, they endeavoured, saith he, prudently to sway a particular Kingdom, and to excite its Members to improve their Reason, and to act like Creatures endow'd with Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. To produce this Reformation in this particular Kingdom, they labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to regulat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> their Family, to the end that it might serve as a Model to all the Subjects of this Kingdom. To reform their Family, they took an extraordinary care to polish their own Person, and so well to compose their Words and Actions, that they might neither say, nor do any thing that might ever so little offend Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaicence, and which was not edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, to the end that they themselve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> might be a Pattern and Example con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually exposed to the Eyes of their Domesticks, and all their Courtiers. To obtain this exterior Perfection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> they strove to rectify their Mind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:53303:27"/>
because that the Passions do, for the most part, remove the Mind from its natural Rectitude, do abase and incline it to all sorts of Vice. To rectify their Mind, to rule and subdue their Passions, they so acted that their Will was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways bent to Good, and never turn'd towards Evil. In fine, thus to dispose their Will, they studied to illuminate their Understanding, and so well to enlighten it, that, if it was possible, they might ignore nothing: for to Will, Desire, Love and Hate, it is necessary to know; This is the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy of right Reason.</p>
                  <p>This is what <hi>Confucius</hi> propos'd to the Princes, to instruct them how to rectify and polish first their own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>terwards the Reason and Person of all their Subjects. But to make the greater Impression, after having gradually descended from the wise Conduct of the whole Empire, to the Perfect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53303:27"/>
If, saith he, the understanding of a Prince is well enlighten'd, his Will will incline only to Good: his Will inclining only to Good, his Soul will be entirely rectified, there will not be any Passion that can make him destroy his Rectitude: The Soul being thus rectified, he will be composed in his exterior, nothing will be observ'd in his Person that can offend Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance. His Person being thus perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, his Family forming it self accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Model, will be reform'd and amended. His Family being arriv'd at this Perfection, 'twill serve as an Example to all the Subjects of the particular Kingdom, and the Members of the particular Kingdom, to all those that compose the Body of the Empire. Thus th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Behold what is most important in <hi>Confucius</hi>'s Doctrine contained in the first Book, and which is the Text, as I may say, whereon his Commentator <hi>Cemçu</hi> has taken pains.</p>
                  <p>This famous Disciple, to explain and enlarge his Masters Instructions, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges Authorities and Examples which he draws from three very anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Books, highly esteemed by the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first Book he mentions, which is of a later date than the rest, is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled <hi>Camcao,</hi> and makes up a part of the Chronicles of the Empire of <hi>Cheu.</hi> This Book was composed by a Prince called <hi>Vuvam,</hi> the Son of King <hi>Venvam.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53303:28"/>
magnifying the Virtues, and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Qualities of this Prince, is to form according to this Model one of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> whom he would perfect in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: And it is observable, that he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily tells him that their Father had the Art of being Virtuous. <hi>Venv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>The second Book from whence <hi>Cem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çu</hi> cites his Authorities and Examples, is called <hi>Tar-Kia.</hi> This Book, which is a great deal ancienter than the first, was writ by a famous Emperor of <hi>Xam,</hi> named <hi>Y-Yin</hi>; 'Tis therein read, that this <hi>Y-Yin,</hi> seeing <hi>Tar-Kia</hi> the Grandson of the Emperor <hi>Chim-Tam</hi> degenerate from the Virtue of his illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious Ancestors, and carry himself af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a manner wholly different from theirs; He commanded him to live three Years in a Garden, where was his Grandfathers Tomb; That this made so great an Impression upon his Spirit, that he chang'd his course: And that the same <hi>Y-Yin</hi> who had done him so kind an Office, having afterwards
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53303:29"/>
advanc'd him to the Empire, <hi>Tar-Kia</hi> govern'd it a long time in great Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. <hi>King</hi> Tam, said <hi>Y-Yin</hi> to <hi>Tar-Kia, King</hi> Tam <hi>always had his Mind disposed to cultivate that precious Reason which h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>In fine, the third Book, which is much ancienter than the two former, is called <hi>Ti-Tien</hi>; and upon the occasion of King <hi>Ya<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> it is there read, <hi>That this Prince could cultivate this sublime Virtue, this great and sublime gift which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from Heaven,</hi> viz. <hi>Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is evident, that <hi>Confucius</hi>'s Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by these Authorities, design'd to shew, or rather supposes that the whole World believes that we have all recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Heaven, those Lights which most Men suffer to extinguish by their Negligence, a Reason which most Men voluntarily slight and suffer to corrupt: And seeing that there were Princes which have perfected these Lights, which have bettered and improved their Reason, we ought to imitate

them, and that we as well as they by their Endeavours, may attain to such a Perfection.</p>
                  <p>We must not here forget a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing which <hi>Cemçu</hi> relates, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Bason wherein King <hi>Tam</hi> us'd to bathe and wash himself.

As for the rest, it has been an ancient Custom amongst the <hi>Chineses</hi> to grave or paint on their Domestick Vessels some Moral Sentences, and strong Exhortations to Virtue: So that when they bath'd themselves, or took their Repasts there, they had these Sentences and Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions continually before their Eyes. This ancient Custom is still preserv'd. There is only this di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that publishes <hi>Confucius</hi>'s Works, that whereas heretofore the Characters were grav'd or painted on the inside of the Vessel, in the middle of the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Face, at present the <hi>Chineses</hi> do most frequently grave or paint them on the outside, <hi>satisfy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>irst parts of his Masters Doctrine, the one of which respects what a Prince should do for his own Perfection, and the other what he is obliged to do for the Perfection and Prosperity of others, he proceeds to the third and last part, wherein he discourses of the last end that every one ought to propose as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Sovereign Good, and whereat he ought to fix. We must remember that by the last End and Sovereign Good, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fucius</hi> understands, as we have already observed, an entire Conformity of our Action<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> with Right Reason.</p>
                  <p>After this, he alledges the Example of that <hi>Venvam,</hi> already spoken of: And certainly this Prince's Conduct was so
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53303:30"/>
wise and regular, that we cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Admiration understand, how by the sole Lights of Nature, he could have such Idea's as he had, and could arrive at so sublime a Virtue as that whereunto he attain'd. It will not be unpleasing to see something of it here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Venvam,</hi> saith the Commentator, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dged that the love which Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces bear to their Subjects, cannot but greatly contribute rightly to Govern and make them happy: And upon this Consideration, he made this love his principal business, which he incessant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavour'd to perfect. Behold the Method he took! Because that the principal Virtue of a Subject is to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and respect his King, <hi>Venvam</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as yet a Subject, fixed himself to render this Honour and Respect; and took so great a pleasure in these sorts of Obligations, that he always fulfill'd them with great Fidelity. As the first and most important Virtue of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to their Parents, is Obedience, <hi>Venvam,</hi> in the Relation of a Son, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her'd to this Obedience; and incessant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53303:31"/>
acquitted himself of this Duty with an extraordinary Piety. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Virtue of a Father, adds <hi>Confucius</hi>'s Disciple, is a tender love for his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: Thus <hi>Venvam,</hi> like a Father, stuck close to this Love, whereof he conti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This Prince, says <hi>Cemçu,</hi> was Born of very Virtuous Parents, who had taken great Care of his Education, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially his Mother <hi>Taicin,</hi> who had been a pattern of Virtue; but he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had so well improv'd this Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53303:31"/>
with so much Reputation, and such a general Esteem, even amongst Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Nations, that Forty four King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms voluntarily submitted to his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Nevertheless, adds he, this great Honour wherewith he was environ'd, was never capable of Eclipsing him: He was Endow'd with an inexpressible and unparallel'd Modesty and Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: He very severely accus'd himself of not being Virtuous enough; for one Day when he was Sick, the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shook with prodigious Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, he sought the Cause of this Calamity, and of the Wrath of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, only in his own Sins, although he was of a Consummate Virtue.</p>
                  <p>That which most appear'd in <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam</hi>'s Actions, was an extraordinary Charity; a Proof whereof we will here allege. In the Annals of <hi>China</hi> it is Recorded, That this Prince having found in the Fields the Bones of a Man, to whom the Honours of Burying were refus'd, he immediately commanded them to be Interr'd; and some of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53303:32"/>

                  <p>To render Virtue yet more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, and more easily to inspire the Sentiments thereof, the same Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple demonstrates, That, whatever is honest and advantagious, being ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, we are obliged to love Virtue, because it includes both these Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53303:35"/>
that moreover Virtue is an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which embellishes, as I may say, the whole Person of him that possesses it, his Interiour and Exteriour; that to the Mind it communicates inexpres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Beauties and Perfections; that as to the Body, it there produces very sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Delights; that it affords a certain Physiognomy, certain Transports, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ways which infinitely please; and as it is the Property of Virtue to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calm the Heart, and keep Peace there, so this inward Tranquillity and secret Joy do produce a certain Serenity in the Countenance, a certain Joy, and Air of Goodness, Kindness and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which attracts the Heart and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem of the whole World. After which he concludes, that the principal Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a Man is to rectifie his Mind, and so well to rule his Heart, that his Passions might always be calm; and if it happen that they be excited, he ought to be mov'd no farther than is necessary; in a word, that he may regulate them according to right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. For, as for instance, adds he, if
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53303:35"/>
we suffer our selves to be transported with excessive Anger, that is to say, if we fall into a Rage without any cause, or more than we ought when we have reason, we may thence conclude, that our Mind has not the Rectitude it ought to have. If we contemn and mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hate a Person, by reason of certain Defects that we observe in him, and render not Justice to his good and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Qualities, if endow'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; if we permit our selves to be troubled by a too great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

lawful, innocent and laudable, we ought not blindly to yield up our selves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and always to follow their Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; it is necessary to consult Reason.

Likewise, If a Son is fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any Sin, 'tis the Duty of a Father to Reprove him, and give him his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice thereon. But if their Love is Blind; if their Love is a mere Passion; if it is Flesh and Blood which make them to Act, this Affection is an Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Affection. Why? Because it dig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Consider, that all these Men have the same Passions with you, and that what you desire they should do, or not do, unto you, they desire that you should do, or not do, unto them.

In the midst of so many mad and blind Persons, which go at random, he must walk aright, and not incline to any party: This is the true Valour.

And lastly, He ought to behave himself towards his Friends, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires that his Friends should carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to him. The perfect Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually acquits himself of these Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, how common soever they may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53303:48"/>
towards the Ground, 'tis not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach Men, and attribute the Cause of his Miseries and Necessities unto them; 'tis to testifie his Humility, that is to say, that he is always contended with his Condition, that he desires no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beyond, and that with Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and an even Spirit, he expects whatever Heaven shall Ordain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him.

                  <p>In the Sequel of this Book, he Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of the profound Respect which the ancient <hi>Chineses,</hi> and especially the Kings and Emperors, had for their Parents, and of the exact Obedience which they paid them. If a King, said they, Honours and Obeys his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother, certainly he will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to excite his Subjects to follow his Example; for brie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ly, a Man that loves Virtue, desires that all others should likewise esteem it, especially if
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53303:49"/>
it is his Interest that they should be Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous: Now 'tis of great importance to a King, that his Subjects do love Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and practice it. Indeed, how can he hope to be obey'd by his Subjects, if himself refuses to Obey those that gave him Life. After all, if a Prince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to bring his Subjects to be Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to their Parents, he must shew Kindness towards them, and treat them with that tenderness which Fathers have for their Children; for we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly imitate those whom we Love, and of whom we think we are Belov'd. But if this Prince, by his Conduct, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites his Subjects to give Obedience to their Parents, and afterwards Obey him, as their common Father, most certainly they will Obey Heaven, from whence Crowns and Empires do come: Heaven, which is the Soveraign Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all. And what will be the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of this Obedience? It will happen that Heaven will diffuse its Blessings on those that shall thus well acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. It will abundantly recompence so admirable a Virtue, it will make
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53303:49"/>
Peace and Concord every where to Reign; so that the King and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects will seem as one single Family, where the Subjects Obeying their King, as their Father, and the King Loving his Subjects as his Children, they will all lead, as in a single, but rich, magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, regular, and convenient House, the happiest and most peaceable Life imaginable.</p>
                  <p>To return to <hi>Confucius,</hi> as he knew that the Examples of Kings made a great impression on Mens Minds, so he proposes that of the Emperor <hi>Xun,</hi> in respect of the Obedience which Children owe to their Parents. <hi>Oh, how great has the Obedience of this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror been!</hi> crys <hi>Confucius.</hi> Thus, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues he, if he has obtain'd from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Imperial Crown, 'tis the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of this Virtue. 'Tis this Virtue that procured him so many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, those immense Riches, and vast Kingdoms, which are only limited by the Ocean. 'Tis this Virtue that has render'd his Name so Famous through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World. In fine, I doubt not
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53303:50"/>
but that long and peaceable Life, which he enjoy'd, ought to be consider'd as a Recompence of this Virtue. To hear this Philosopher speak, would it not be said, that he had read the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, and understood the Promise which God has there made to those that Honour their Father and Mother. But if, by what <hi>Confucius</hi> declares, it seems, that the Decalogue was not unknown to him, it will rather seem that he knew the Maxims of the Gospel, when we shall see what he Teaches concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Charity, which he says it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to have for all Men.</p>
                  <p>That Love, saith he, which it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite for all Men to have, is not a Stranger to Man, 'tis Man himself; or, if you will, 'tis a Natural Property of Man, which dictates unto him, that he ought generally to love all Men. Nevertheless, above all Men to love his Father and Mother, is his main and principal Duty, from the practice of which he afterwards proceeds, as by degrees, to the practise of that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Love, whose object is all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53303:50"/>
'Tis from this Universal Love that distributive Justice comes, that Justice, which makes us to render to every one his Due, and more especially to cherish and honour Wise and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Men, and to advance them to the Dignities and Offices of State. That difference, which is between the Love we have for our Parents, and that we have for others, between the Love we bear to Virtuous and Learned Men, and that we bear to those which have not so much Virtue or Ability; that difference, I say, is as it were a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, a Symmetry of Duties, which the Reason of Heaven has protected, and in which nothing must be Changed.</p>
                  <p>For the Conduct of Life <hi>Confucius</hi> proposes Five Rules, which he calls Universal.</p>

                     <item>The First Regards the Justice that ought to be practis'd between a King and his Subjects.</item>
                     <item>The Second Respects the Love that ought to be between a Father and his Children.</item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="84" facs="tcp:53303:51"/>The Third Recommends Conjugal Fidelity to Husbands and Wives.</item>
                     <item>The Fourth concerns the Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ought to appear between El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Younger Brothers.</item>
                     <item>The Fifth obliges Friends to live in Concord, in great Unity, and mutual Kindness.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Behold, adds he, the Five General Rules, which every one ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve; behold, as it were the Five Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Roads, by which Men ought to pass. But after all we cannot observe these Rules, if these Three Virtues are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Prudence,</hi> which makes us dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Good from Evil, <hi>Vniversal Love,</hi> which makes us love all Men, and that <hi>Resolution</hi> which makes us constantly to persevere in the Adhesion to Good, and Aversion to Evil. But for fear least some fearful Persons not well verst in Morality should imagine, that it is impossible for them to acquire these Three Virtues, he affirms, that there is no Person incapable of acquiring them; that the impotence of the Man is vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tary. How dull soever a Man is,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53303:51"/>
should he, says he, be without any Experience, yet if he desires to learn, and grows not weary in the Study of Virtue, he is not very far from Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. If a Man, although full of Self-love, endeavours to perform good Actions, behold him already very near that Universal Love, which engages him to do Good to all. In fine, if a Man feels a secret Shame, when he hears impure and unchast Discourses; if he cannot forbear Blushing thereat, he is not far from that Resolution of Spirit, which makes him constantly to seek after Good, and to have an Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for Evil.</p>
                  <p>After that, the Chinese Philosopher has Treated of these Five Universal Rules, he proposes Nine particular ones for Kings, because that he considers their Conduct, as a publick Source of Happiness or Misery. They are these.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. A King ought incessantly to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to adorn his Person with all sorts of Virtues.</item>
                     <item>2. He ought to Honour and Cherish the Wise and Virtuous.</item>

                     <item>5. He ought to accommodate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as much as it is possible, to the Sentiments and Mind of other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and as for those that have less considerable Employs, he ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider them as his Members.</item>
                     <item>6. He ought to Love his People, even the meanest as his own Children, and to share in the various Subjects of Joy or Sorrow, which they may have.</item>
                     <item>7. He ought to use his utmost to bring into his Kingdom several able Artificers in all sorts of Arts, for the advantage and conveniency of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</item>
                     <item>8. He ought kindly and courteously to receive Strangers and Travellers, and fully to protect them.</item>
                     <item>9. Lastly, he ought tenderly to love the Princes, and great Men of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,

and so heartily to Study their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, that they may Love him, and be ever Faithful to him.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Rightly to understand the Morals of <hi>Confucius,</hi> it is here necessary to speak one Word concerning the distinction which he makes between the <hi>Saint</hi> and <hi>Wise.</hi> To the one and the other he attributes certain things in common: But to the <hi>Saint</hi> he gives some Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and advantages, which he says, that the Wise has not. He says, That Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Innocence have been equally communicated to the <hi>Wise,</hi> and to the <hi>Saint,</hi> and likewise to all other Men; but that the <hi>Saint</hi> has never in the least declin'd from right Reason, and has constantly preserv'd his Integrity; whereas the <hi>Wise</hi> has not always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd it, having not always followed the Light of Reason, because of several Obstacles he has met with in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Virtue, and especially, by Reason of his Passions, whereunto he is a Slave. So that it is necessary, that he does his utmost, that he use great Pains and Endeavours, to put his Heart
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53303:53"/>
in a good posture, and to govern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self according <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o the Lights of Right Reason, and the Rules of Virtue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cusu</hi> Reasoning hereon, the better to illustrate his Masters Doctrine, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares those that have lost their first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and desires to regain it, to those wither'd and almost dead Trees, that notwithstanding have in the Trunk and Roots, a certain Juice, a certain Principle of Life, which makes them cast forth shoots. If, saith he, we take care of these Trees, if we Cultivate them, Water them, and Prune off the dead Branches, it will happen that this Tree will re-assume its former State. After the same manner, although one has lost his first Integrity and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, he need only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>xcite the Good that remains, use Pains and Industry, and he will Infallibly arrive at the highest Virtue. This last State, saith <hi>Cusu,</hi> this State of the Wise is called <hi>Giantao,</hi> that is to say, <hi>The Road and the Reason of Man,</hi> or rather, the way which leads to the Origine of the first Perfection. And the State of the <hi>Saint</hi>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:53303:53"/>
is called <hi>Tientao,</hi> that is to say, <hi>The Reason of Heaven,</hi> or the First Rule which Heaven has equally distributed to all Men, and which the <hi>Saints</hi> have always observ'd, without turning either on the Right Hand, or on the Left.</p>
                  <p>As Rules do in brief contain the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Duties, and that we may easily retain them, <hi>Confucius</hi> gives Five to those that desire to chuse the Good and adhere thereto.</p>

                     <item>2. Because that amongst the Things which are known, there may be some which are not perfectly known, it is necessary carefully to examine them, to weigh them Minutely and in every Circumstance, and thereon to consult Wise, Intelligent and Experienc'd Men.</item>
                     <item>3. Although it seems that we clearly apprehend certain Things, yet because it is easie to transgress, through Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitancy, in the too much, or too little,

it is necessary to Meditate afterwards in particular, on the things we believe we know, and to weigh every thing by the weight of Reason, with all the attentiveness of Spirit, and with the utmost exactness, whereof we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable.</item>
                     <item>4. It is necessary to endeavour, not to apprehend Things, after a confused manner, it is requisite to have some clear Ideas thereof, so that we may truly discern the Good from the Bad, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in Company or in Publick. Have you a desire, continues he, that I should shew you after what manner he that has acquir'd some Perfection governs himself. Why, he keeps a continual watch upon himself; he undertakes nothing, begins nothing, pronounces no Word, whereon he has not Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Before he raises any Motion in his Heart, he carefully observes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he reflects on every thing, he exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines every thing, he is in a continual Vigilance. Before he Speaks he is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that what he is about to utter is True and Rational, and he thinks that he cannot reap a more pleasant Fruit from his Vigilance and Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than to accustom himself Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspectly and Wisely to govern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the Things which are neither seen nor known by any.</p>

                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:53303:56"/>In the first place there is represented a Disciple of this famous Philosopher, who declares, that he spent not a Day wherein he render'd not an account to himself of these three things.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Whether he had not undertaken some Affair for another, and whether he manag'd and follow'd it with the same Eagerness and Fidelity as if it had been his own Concern.</item>

                  <p>Afterwards appears <hi>Confucius,</hi> giving Lessons to his Disciples. He tells them, that the Wise ought to be so occupied with his Virtue, that when he is in his House, he ought not to seek his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency and Delight; That when he undertakes any Affair, he ought to be
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53303:56"/>
diligent and exact, prudent and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in his Words, and that though he have all these Qualities, yet he ought to be the Person on whom he ought least to confide; he whom he ought least to please: That in a word, the Wise-Man always distrus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>te his Conduct and Actions according to their Counsels and Examples.</p>
                  <p>What think you of a Poor Man, says one of his Disciples to him, who being able to extenuate and diminish his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty through Flattery, refuses to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this Offer, and couragiously main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that none but Cowards and low-spirited Men do flatter? What think you of a Rich Man, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his Riches, is not proud? I say, replies <hi>Confucius,</hi> that they are both praise-worthy, but that they are not to be considered, as if they were arrived at the highest degree of Virtue. He that is poor, ought to be chearful, and content in the midst of his Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence:

Behold wherein the Virtue of the Poor Man consists; and he that is Rich, ought to do good to all: He that is of a poor and abject Spirit, does good only to certain Persons; certain Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, certain particular Friendships cause him to act, his Friendship is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested: He disperses his Wealth only with a prospect of reaping more than he sows; he seeks only his own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest: But the love o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A Souldier of the Kingdom of <hi>Ci,</hi> said they unto him, lost his Buckler, and having a long time sought after it in vain, he at last com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts himself, upon the loss he had sustained, with this Reflection; <hi>A Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier has lost his Buckler, but a Souldier of our Camp has found it, he will use it.</hi> It had been much better spoken, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies <hi>Confucius,</hi> if he had said, <hi>A Man has lost his Buckler, but a Man will find it</hi>; thereby intimating, that we ought to have an Affection for all the Men of the World.</p>

Nevertheless, although the last of these Genius's was very much inferiour to the first; yet to him were render'd greater Honours than to him that had all the Domestick Affairs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Protection: And there was a Proverb which imply'd, <hi>That it was better to seek the Protection of</hi> Cao, <hi>than of</hi> Noao.

                     <hi>Confucius</hi> Recommends nothing so much to his Disciples as Clemency and Courtesie; always grounded upon this Maxim, That we ought to Love all Men. And to make them better to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Truth of what he said, he made an Instance of Two Illustrious Princes, that were distinguish'd for this very thing in the Kingdom of <hi>Cucho.</hi> These Princes, saith he, were so mild and courteous, that they easily forgot the most hainous Injuries, and horrible Crimes, when the Offenders shew'd any sign of Repentance. They beheld these Criminals, though worthy of the severest Punishments, as if they had been Innocent; they not only forgot their Faults, but by their Carriage, made even those that had committed them, in some measure to forget them, and loose one part of the Disgrace, which remains after great Lapses, and which can only discourage in the way of Virtue.</p>

                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:53303:59"/>One of this Philosophers great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs being to form Princes to Virtue, and to teach the Art of Reigning hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, he made no difficulty to Addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing himself directly to them, and of giving them Counsel. A Prince, said he, one day to a King of <hi>Lu,</hi> called <hi>Timcum,</hi> A Prince ought to be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, he ought not to contemn any of his Subjects, he ought to Recompence those that deserve it.

                     <hi>Confucius</hi> would have Princes desire nothing that other Men wish for, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are sometimes good Things, which it seems they might desire without Offence; he would have them to Trample, as I may say, upon whatever may make the Felicity of Mortals upon Ear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And a long Life is generally a Series of Misfortunes.</hi> There are found few Emperors like to <hi>Yao,</hi> crys <hi>Confucius</hi> after this.</p>
                  <p>That which generally occasions trouble to Kings, that, which in some measure, redoubles the weight of the Burden annext to their Crown, is either the few Subjects over which they Reign, or the little Wealth which they possess.

He says, That a King has Subjects enough, when his Subjects are Contented; and that his Kingdom is Rich enough, when Peace and Concord Flourish there. <hi>Peace and Concord,</hi> saith this Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, <hi>Are the Mothers of Plenty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In fine, <hi>Confucius,</hi> in Speaking of the Duties of Princes, teaches, That it is so necessary for a Prince to be Virtuous, that when he is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53303:60"/>
a Subject is oblig'd by the Laws of Heaven, voluntarily to banish himself, and to seek another Country.</p>
                  <p>He sometimes complains of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of Princes; but the great Subject of his Complaints, is, The Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies of private Men. He bewails the Morals of his Age; he says, That he sees almost no Body that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes himself, either by Piety, or some extraordinary Quality; that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very One is corrupted, that every One is deprav'd, and that it is amongst the Magistrates and Courtiers, chiefly, that Virtue is neglected. It is true, that <hi>Confucius</hi> seems to extend Things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Reason. Indeed, 'twas not much for this Philosopher, when in a Princes Court he found but Ten or Twelve Persons of an extraordinary Wisdom, to cry out, <hi>O Tempora, O Mores.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Vuvam</hi>'s Reigns, there were Ten Men of a Consummate Virtue and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, on whom this Emperor might repose all the Affairs of the Empire: Yet <hi>Confucius</hi> exclaims against so small a number, saying, That great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53303:61"/>
Virtue, and the Qualities of the Spirit, are Things very rare in his Age. He had made the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints in respect of the Emperor <hi>Zun,</hi> the First of the Family of <hi>Cheu,</hi> although this Prince had then Five Praefects, of whose Merit some Judgment may be made by the History of one of these Ministers, whose Name was <hi>Yu.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Wise Minister had render'd his Memory immortal amongst the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses,</hi> not only because it was he that invented the Secret of stopping or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Waters that overflow'd the whole Kingdom, and which made it almost uninhabitable, but because that being an Emperor, he always liv'd like a Philosopher. He was of an Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Family; for he could Name some Emperors of his Ancestors: But if by the Decadency of his House, he was fall'n from the Pretensions he might have to the Empire, his Wisdom and Virtue acquir'd him what Fortune had refus'd to the Nobility of his Extraction. The Emperor <hi>Zun</hi> so thoroughly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood his Desert, that he associated
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53303:61"/>
him to the Empire: And Seventeen Years after, he declar'd him his Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Successor, even to the Exclusion of his own Son. <hi>Yu</hi> refus'd this Honour, but as he vainly deny'd it, and that his Generosity might not suffer, in the pressing Sollicitations that were made him on all hands, he withdrew from the Court, and went to seek a Retreat in a Cell: But not being able so well to conceal himself, as not to remain undiscover'd in the Rocks of his Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, he was forceably advanc'd to the Throne of his Ancestors. Never Throne was more easie of Access than this Princes, never Prince was more Affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It is reported, that he one day left his Dinner Ten times, to peruse the Petitions that were presented him, or to hear the Complaints of the Distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: And that he ordinarily quitted his Bath, when Audience was deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him. He Reigned Ten Years with so much Success, with so much Tranquility, and in such great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all Things, that of this Age it may be truly said, That it was a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53303:62"/>
Golden Age. <hi>Yu</hi> was an 100 Years old when he Died; and he Died as he had Liv'd: For prefering the Interest of the Empire before that of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, he would not let his Son succeed him, he gave the Crown to one of his Subjects, whose Virtue was known unto him. A Prince, doubtless, is happy, when he can some time dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge himself of the Cares which throw and press him on such a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster; and <hi>Zun</hi> only could be so, seeing that he at one time had Five, all wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of being Seated on the Throne, but this Number was not great enough for <hi>Confucius,</hi> 'tis what made him to grieve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Confucius</hi> says, That a Prince ought never to accept the Crown to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of his Father, how unworthy soever his Father might be thereof; That it is one of the greatest Crimes whereof a Prince can be Guilty; and this occasion'd him to relate two little Histories, which Suit admirably to his Subject.</p>

The cunning and guilty Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, who saw her self detected, and who had a great Influence over her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Spouse, alledg'd such plausible Reasons, to make him believe her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, that this poor Prince, shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Eyes against the Truth, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd his Son: But as Children are not culpable for their Fathers Crimes, he kept <hi>Che</hi> with him: He was the Son of this disgraced Prince. <hi>Limcum</hi> died soon after. The People recalled the Prince whom the Queens Debaucheries had banisht; and he went to receive the Crown, but his vicious Son oppos'd

This King, whose History we shall relate in two Words, had three Sons: And as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have sometimes more tenderness for their youngest Children, than for the rest, he had so much for the last which Heaven had given him, that some days before his Death, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him for his Successor, to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Brother, touch'd with such an Heroick Action, conjur'd him the same moment, not to oppose the Inclination of all the People, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd him to Reign over them. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that it was he alone, that was the lawful Successor to the Crown, which he contemned; That their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could not violate the Laws of the State; That this Prince was overtaken with a too great Fondness, and that in a word, it in some measure belonged to the People to redress the Laws of their Kings, when they were not just. But nothing could perswade him to act contrary to his Fathers Will. Between these two Princes, there was a laudable Contestation; neither would accept the Crown: And they seeing, that this

Contest would continue a long time, withdrew from the Court; and Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish'd and Victorious together, they went to end their Days in the repose of a Solitude, and left the Kingdom to their Brother.
