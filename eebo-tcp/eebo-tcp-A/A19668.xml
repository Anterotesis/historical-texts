         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Whilſt that I dyd thus take pleaſure in viſiting Fryeties &amp; Abbies, Nunneries &amp; ſuch other deuout places: it pleaſed God to touch my hard hart, and to mollifie it with the teares of deuotion. To be briefe, I toke in mind to leaue ſtudie, and to forſake the life of a Scholler, which I ledde at the Engliſh Colledge, and to make my ſelfe a Fryer or a Monke, as others did.

               <p>Your ſickle witte appeareth ſtill more and more. You were verie well (you ſay) in the Colledge at <hi>Rhemes:</hi> yet after ſeauentéene monthes aboade there, you longed verie much to goe to <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Italie,</hi> by like y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exerciſe of learning in <hi>Rhemes,</hi> was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then your idle head could away with, and therefore you longed ſo greatlie to goe to <hi>Rome,</hi> in hope to finde a more idle life there. To goe from place to place, from Frierie to Frierie, from the Nunnes to the Munckes, to heare maſſe, and to kiſſe the Reliques of Saintes, was a iollye idle life. But I pray you, are you aſſured that the Reliques that you kiſſed were the Reliques of Saintes? When the Reliques that were in Churches in Englande, came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of them that could and would conſider them with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I my ſelfe ſawe one bone, that had a Label of parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment faſtened to it, wherein was written. <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

In the Abbay of Hayles, a Relique was kept, which was ſaid to be the blood of Chriſt, but when the Pyx (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was kept) was opened, it was found to be a matter like very fine ſande, or a liquid Gumme of a ſanguine coloure. I my ſelfe (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then but young) did ſée and reade the Hiſtory of the bringing of that ſuppoſed blood thether, which Hiſtorie was written in a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faſt by the entring into that Chappell where the Relique was kept. The hiſtory was ſo doubtfull, that euen then I beganne to doubt of the trueth thereof. For in the Hiſtory it was not plainelie affirmed to be a portion of the bloode that iſhued out of the bodye of Chriſt, but either a portion of that blood, or els of blood that iſhue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of a crucifix that was found in the houſe of a Jewe in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and ſet-vp on the Mount of Caluerie in deriſion, into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſide whereof, blinde Longius, was cauſed to thruſt his Speare, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by great plenty of bloode did iſhue, and was reſerued by ſuch as were preſent. &amp;c. The Nayles that faſtened our Sauiour to the Croſſe, were in number but thrée, and they came all to the handes

of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperour, by his mother <hi>Helena.</hi> He cauſed one of them to be wrought into the byt of his brydle, that hée ſhould vſe in the warres, another in the Coone of his Helmet, to faſten his plume of Feathers in, and the third he caried alwayes about him, and being in daunger in a ſtorme on the <hi>Adrian</hi> Sea, he caſt it in to the Sea to ſtay the rage thereof.

In like manner the men alſo, leauing the naturall vſe of the woman, burned in their luſtes or filthy deſires, one towards an other, men with men wrought filthines, receiuing in themſelues the rewarde of theyr error, which (in Gods iuſtice) was due vnto them.

And vndoubtedlie thou ſhalt ſée, that, that Romiſh Churche, which calleth herſelfe Catholike, is héerein plainly painted out. Haue they not chaunged, and doo they not ſtill chaunge, the glory of the incorruptible God, into the ſimilitude of a corruptible manne. When they haue ſet forth, and doo ſtill ſet forth, the maieſty of God to the viewe of mans eye, by the Image of an olde man, made of Tymber, ſtone, or other matter, or wrought by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cunning of Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or Embrotherers?

And yet that Romiſh Catholike Church, dare ſtill make it, haue it in their Churches, and fall downe before it. Hath not God in <hi>Exo. 20.</hi> Expreſly forbidden the making and worſhipping of all manner of Images? And howe dare any man make, or worſhipp them, or ſay that, that Church is Chriſtes Church, that doth both make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, worſhip them, and perſecute thoſe Chriſtians that refuſe to doo as they doo? Waie well the words of the Apoſtle, when he ſayth.

               <p>When GOD opened the hart of King Henry the eyght, and gaue him ſome ſight of the truth, he cauſed the Monkes, the Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the Nunnes that then were in his Realme to bee exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and by due and politike examination, they were found to haue doone, euen as S.

Thus much I haue thought méete to write, concerning the firſt part of your vowe, which is, to liue in wyneles chaſtity.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of your vowe, is pouertie. To be poore, to haue nothing, not ſo much as the Garments on your back for your own. This part of your vowe, was altogether néedeles. For ſince you were borne, you neuer gaue your ſelfe to any ſuch exerciſe, that you might be able thereby to haue anie thing of your owne. But you haue béene fedde and clothed, and in all points ſuſtayned, by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of your poore father and mother, and other that haue hoped to ſee a better proofe of you then nowe is ſeene, and therefore exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their fréendlie liberalitie to you.

But you will aunſwere me and ſay: We doo laboure, for we riſe euerie night at midnight, and we ſing Mattins before the bleſſed Sacrament of the Alter, we ariſe againe at ſixe of the clocke in the morning, and we ſing two or thrée high maſſes euerie day. &amp;c. But let me tell you what I haue hearde reported concerning Frauncis, of whom the Gray Friers doo holde. That Frauncis was (as the report goeth) a good man, and gaue himſelfe to ſore laboure, in repayring of high waies that were decayed in the Countrey where he dwelt. And on a time as he was at his laboure, a companie of tall fellowes that had beene théeues, and were condemned to be hanged, were by the Officers
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:9611:16"/>
brought that way towards the Gallowſe to bee executed. When Frauncis ſawe them, he was moued with pittie, and beſought the Officers to ſtaie the execution whilſt hee might goe to the King, (who lay then not farre off) and begge their pardon, and ſo it was doone. When Frauncis had obtained pardon for theſe men, hee clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed them in ſuch apparell as the Gray Fryers doo nowe weare, and girded thoſe Garments to them, with the halters wherewyth they ſhould haue béene hanged. The Garment is very commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for it is long and large, and may be tucked vp ſhort, &amp; let down to the foote, as occaſion ſhall ſerue, and require for the commodity of the wearer of it. It hath a hoode that may hang on the backe, and not be any let in labour, and when néede is, it may couer and defend the head and face from the iniuries of the wether. Theſe men being thus apparailed, fell to their laboure luſtily, &amp; in ſhort ſpace, brought their maſters worke to ſuch forwardnes, that hee thought méete to trauaile into ſome other part of the Countrey, to ſée where other decayed high wayes were, that he might kéepe his newe men and himſelfe in worke ſtill. But to be briefe, he was from them ſo long, that they hauing finiſhed the worke that he left them in, had gotten them a houſe in the next Towne, and had perſwaded the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple thereof, that by ryſing at midnight, and making of continuall prayers vnto God for that people that ſhoulde ſéede and maintayne them without laboure, they ſhould be much more beneficiall to the Common weale, then they could be by any ſore laboure of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in emending the high wayes that ſhould be decaied. But when Frauncis came, and found them thus occupied, hee vtterly miſliked with them, and ſayd vnto them. Théeues I found you, and theeues I leaue you. And ſo departing from them, he would haue no more to doo with them. If this be not true, then blame them that haue made this report of Frauncis, whom the Gray Fryers take for their Patron. If it be true, then you may ſée what beginning the Order of the Gray Friers had, and howe acceptable that ryſing at midnight and ſinging of Mattens and maſſes was to that Fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, of whoſe holines the Gray Fryers doo make ſo great bragges. And ſo by good conſequence, what account good and wiſe men ſhold make of the great paines that you and your Brethren doo take, in your ryſing and ſinging both by day and by night. Whether thys Frauncis were your Frauncis of <hi>Paula</hi> or not, I leaue to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed

               <p>The third part of your vowe, or (as you doo terme it) your third vowe was obedience, to be obedient to the Pryor, and to your ſuperiors. If you had conſidered well of that triple vowe that was made for you in Baptiſme, and your ſelfe confirmed, when you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered me in my Church at Creplegate in London, I thinke you would haue thought this newe triple vowe, altogether vnneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: except you meant to reuoke your firſt triple vowe made to GOD, and in ſtéede thereof to make a newe triple vow to man. For what haue you vowed héere (in ſubſtance) that was not vowed before in your firſt triple vowe?

And when you teache that in the Sacrament of the body and blood of Chriſt, there remaineth no ſubſtance of bread and wyne, and ſo you make it no Sacrament. For (as you once learned, and did openly confeſſe in my Church) euery Sacrament muſt conſiſt of two parts, that is, both of earthly and of heauenly matter, and not of the one matter onely? And when you giue it that newe name, calling it the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Altare, and when you doo reſerue it, hanging it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer your Altar, carrying it abroade to ſhew it to the people, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to fail downe and worſhip it, and ſo make an Idoll of it? Yea when in your maſſe you make a ſacrifice of it, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſins both of the liuing &amp; of the dead? yea and in ſtormes &amp; tempeſtious wether, you make it a bugge to feare the deuill withall.

And what mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth this, but that the name of Frauncis, hath blotted out both the name of Debnam, and the name Chriſtian alſo.</p>

So that Samuell Debnam is the Chriſtian, and Iohn Frauncis is the Fryer. Iudge you whether of theſe is likely to be founde in Gods Regiſter, which is called the booke of life. If Chriſt bee that life, then they are written in the booke of life that be Chriſtians, If Frauncis be not that life, then are not they written in the booke of life which be Franciſcans, and ſo of all other your Popiſh Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Be not deceiued therefore Samuell. The Corinthians whom Paule rebuked, did vndoubtedly thinke as you doo. That is, that holding of Cephas, Apollo, and Paule: they did not forſake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peace of Chriſt. For ſo (I am aſſured) you thinke, that hauing profeſſed the Religion of Frauncis, you haue not forſaken the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt. And yet Paule doth charge them as men, that in their dooinges gaue occaſion to him to conceiue this opinion of them, that they were become Cephaſians, Apollianiſtes, and Pauliſts, and not Chriſtians. Take héede Samuell, our aduerſary the deuyll is ſubtyll, and doth oftentimes ſhewe himſelfe in the likenes of an Angell of light. You haue (I thinke) read the ſixt Chapter of Saint Iohns Reuelations. And you either haue or may reade, the godlie and learned interpretations, that godly learned men haue made, concerning the foure horſes therein mentioned. The firſte being white, doth prefigure the time that was begunne, when this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation was ſhewed to Iohn, and did continue all his dayes, and hath continued euer ſince, and ſhall continue euen to the ende: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not ſo generallie, and ſo apparantlie as at the firſt.

And his ryder dooth with his arrowes ſtrike the harts of ſuch as he wyll conquere and make ſubiecte vnto him. And thus hee goeth foorth ſtill conquering, that he might ouercome and conquere.

You ſay, that you doo at midnight ſing your Mattins before the bleſſed Sacrament of the Altar, the precious bodie and blood of our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt which is there kept ouer the high Altar. What pleaſure you doo, or can doo to that Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, by ſinging your Mattins before it, I can not vnderſtand: for I think it can not heare any one word that you doo either ſing or ſay, and ſo it can not be delighted with the hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of your muſicke. I put you in minde of theſe thinges, becauſe your greateſt Clerkes haue written, that Chriſt is not in that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament of yours, with his dementions and liniaments of bodie, neither with his Organs of ſences: but meruailouſly, &amp; with out the diſtinction of parts.

For vndoubtedly, you can not but wyſh that you had doone, before you haue well begunne. And what thankes can you looke for at the handes of that Sacrament that you ſing your Mattins before?

If it bée a point of holines to lye in bedde without ſhéetes, then are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort of people in diuers parts in England as holy as you, for they neuer lie in any, &amp; yet they putt of their clothes when they goe to bedde. And I my ſelfe hauing béene in ſome of thoſe parts of the Realme, haue taken ſuch lodging as the Country vſeth, but I haue not lyen in my clothes as you ſay that you doo. I doo know by that little experience that I haue had therein, that after a man is acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed for ſome ſpace to lie in blankets, he will choſe rather to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue that kind of lodging then to change it. But let this matter paſſe, for a Louſe bredde in blankets, is not more holye then that Louſe that is bredd in ſhéetes. And this Epitheten louſie, hath bene thought méete for a Fryer euer ſince I could remember. You ſay that you got to bedde at eight of the clocke. &amp;c. I know diuers Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in London (and I think ſuch may be found in <hi>Paris</hi> alſo) that labouring ſore all the day long, doo not ſléepe before eleuen of the clocke, and yet ryſe againe at foure or fyue at the furdeſt, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſléepe not aboue 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> howres in one night, where as by your own con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſſion, you doo commonlie ſléepe 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> houres, and doo no labour at all, but loyter all the day long. The Religion therefore of thoſe labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Artificers, is (in that point) ſtraighter then yours. When you doo (or when anie of you dooth) a miſſe: hee that hath offended muſt doo penaunce. If this be true, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt you all doo penaunce euerie day.

I haue heard of an Abbot in England, that inioined his horſe ſuch penaunce, becauſe he felt him too luſtie &amp; ſturring vnder hym.

The quality and quantity of your bread may bee ſuch, that it ſhall rather be a pleaſure then a puniſhment to bee put to that pennaunce.

You imagine that wee wyll aſke you wherefore you haue made this choiſe: you anſwere, for your owne ſinnes and ours. Oh thou child of the deuill, full of all guyle and diſceite: dareſt thou ſhoulder Chriſt, and thruſt thy ſelfe into the office of mediation, which belongeth onelie to Chriſte? canſt thou (wretched Frier) ſatiſfie to God, bothe for thine owne ſinnes and for ours?

The Diuines doo (by a generall conſent) ſay, that becauſe the burden of ſinne, and the damnation due vnto it, is ſo great and horrible in the ſight of GOD, that the wrath of God for ſinne, could not otherwiſe be appeaſed, nor his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſatiſfyed, then by the cruell and bloodie death of that man that neuer had ſinned, neither was by any meanes ſpotted or defyled with ſinne, and therefore had not any way deſerued to die. And heerevpon they conclude, that of neceſſitie, the onely begotten ſonne of God, in whome there coulde be no ſinne, muſt take mans nature of the ſubſtaunce of a bleſſed virgine, prepared before of GOD for that purpoſe, that the nature of man taken of her ſubſtaunce, might not haue in it any part of mans ſinne, and that, that ſonne of God, béeing both God and man, might die in his mans nature, that blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die death that mans ſinne had deſerued, and ſo Gods wrath myght be appeaſed, and his iuſtice ſatiſfyed, which could neuer haue béene brought to paſſe by any other meane. Héereof wee may conclude, that in ſome ſort our ſinnes were the cauſe of the death of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>our Chriſt. This leſſon you had once learned, and did repeate it openlie in my Church at Creplegate of London, in the preſence and hearing of a great multitude of Chriſtians, which conceiued no ſmall hope, that you béeing borne of ſuch Chriſtian Parents (as you were) and brought vp vnder ſuch maſters, as had ſo inſtructed you in Chriſtian Religion, that beeing but of tender yeeres, you were ſo perfect in the principles of that our Religion, woulde haue prooued an excellent Miniſter in the houſe of God, to the great ioye of ſuch as had béene at charge in your education, and to the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Chriſtes glory in the Realme of Englande, your natiue Countrey.

Make not ſo light a matter of ſinne, as to thinke that Iohn Baptiſtes féeding vpon Locuſts and wylde honney, &amp;c. could be any helpe to take away anie part of the damnation due to our ſinnes. Be aſhamed of that fonde perſwaſion that mooued you to ſay thus. Conſider this (I pray you) If another ſuffer for my ſinnes: ſhall not I my ſelfe ſuffer? You ſéeme to be perſwaded, that of neceſſity we muſt ſuffer for our owne ſinnes, becauſe Chriſt hath ſuffered for them alreadie. Whereas (in verie déede) the contrarye is moſt true.

               <p>Héere you haue heaped together a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of Scriptures, to a farre other ende, then they were at the firſt written. That is to prooue that you were moued by thoſe Scriptures, to make choyſe of that Religion wherein you liue, and that otherwiſe you coulde not eſcape the heauy wrathe of GOD, and ſo conſequently, that who ſoeuer will eſcape Gods wrath muſt doo as you doo. And firſt you ſay, we reade in the 5. Chapter of Leuiticus &amp;c. In this place of Leuiticus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is not one word that may rightly be applyed to your purpoſe, as ſhall (I hope) plainelie appeare, euen to your ſelfe, if you can with indifferent iudgment reade that which heere followeth.</p>
               <p>And firſt I muſt admoniſh you of one point of peniſhe ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ſheweth it ſelfe in all that be of your ſorte, as often as you haue occaſion to tranſlate into Engliſh, this Latine word <hi>Dominus.</hi> For ſuperſticiouſly (as I take it) you ad vnto it the English of the Latine Pronowne <hi>Noſter.</hi> Yea, though there be in the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtance of the text, nothing to be founde that might giue you any occaſion ſo to doo. As in this place of Leuiticus, you haue no occaſion at al to ſay: Our Lord God commaunded the Children of Iſraell. &amp;c. For
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:9611:26"/>
the commaundements that are written in that Chapter, are gyuen by Moſes, by whom the Lord God of Iſraell did ſpeake to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſraell. And Moſes ſpeaking to them in the name of that Lorde that bidde him ſpeake vnto them, dooth not vſe any ſpéeche that may bee rightly tranſlated into Engliſh, Our Lord. For thus he ſaith in the place that you cite. <hi>Anima quae iurauerit, &amp; protulerit labijs ſuis, vt vel male faceret, vel bene: et id ipſum iuramento &amp; ſermo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne firmauerit, oblita<expan>

What is héere written that might mooue you to ſay, that our Lord commaunded the children of Iſraell to doo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce when they had committed any offence? I muſt admoniſhe you alſo of your fault, in tranſlating continually penaunce, in ſtéede of repentaunce. For as (commonly) when the Latine word <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus</hi> is vſed in the Scriptures, it dooth ſignifie that mighty Lorde which is Lorde of all, &amp; is not to be reſtrained by anie Pronowne, from that Generall ſignification, as to ſay, my Lord, our Lorde, or their Lord, becauſe he is not onely, mine, ours, or theirs, but the Lord of all: Euen ſo the worde <hi>Poenitentia</hi> is not to be drawne to an outward ſhewe of repentaunce onely, which may be called pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, and may be as well in Hypocrites, as in ſuch as be peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in déede. The Grecians (as you knowe, I thinke) doo name it by a name, that by interpretation doth ſignifie, <hi>Poſt factum ſapere.</hi> To bée late wiſe, as in Engliſh we vſe to terme it, <gap reason="foreign">

As in your preſent caſe, it may be, and I hope it wyll ſhortlie come to paſſe, that you returning to your former minde, wyll miſlike with your diſobedient manner of departing from your naturall Parents, and with your diſloyall leauing of your natiue Countrey, and ſo repent that you haue bound your ſelfe by a vowe to liue a <hi>Minime</hi> Fryer all the dayes of your life, which is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>profitable, bothe to your Parents and Countrey, directly contrarye
<pb facs="tcp:9611:27"/>
to the Lawes both of God and of nature. If it ſhall pleaſe GOD to worke this <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> in you, you muſt, (if you will doo well) return to that firſt vowe which was made for you when you were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and leaue the latter vow, repenting that euer you were ſo mad as to make it, béeing (as it is) ſo contrary to that vowe which you firſt made in your Baptiſme, and profeſſed afterwardes before ſo manie witneſſes. Follow not the example of Herod &amp; ether, which making vowes did wickedly, but more wickedly in the perſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of thoſe vowes. Math. 14. Judg. 11. Acts. 23. Wée knowe what your maiſters of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> either haue taught, or can teache you tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this matter. If you be determined, and will not hearken to better aduice, we can but wyſhe you well, and ſorrowe to ſée your wilfull follye.</p>
               <p>But to returne to the place of Leuiticus the fift Chapter, which you alledge: if you will looke into the Hebrew text, you ſhall finde no ſuch worde as you ſéeme to take holde vppon. The worde that is vſed there, can not ſignifie to doo penaunce: but doth ſignifie, that he may confeſſe that wherin he hath ſinned, or offended. This place therefore, ſerueth nothing for your purpoſe. The next place that you alledge, is out of the 21. of the Judges. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niuerſus Iſrael valde doluit, &amp; poenitentiam egit, ſuper hoc quod fiebat,</hi> ſay you, but that tranſlation, that is beſt allowed by men of your ſort, hath it thus. <hi>Super interfectione vnius tribus ex Iſrael.</hi> Howe can you then tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it thus into Engliſh. All the people of Iſrael were very ſorry, and they did penaunce for that which they had doone? But if you will looke into the Hebrewe text, you ſhall find that you ſhould haue ſayd thus. The people ſorowed for the <hi>Beniamits,</hi> becauſe the Lord had made a breache in the tribes or kindreds of Iſraell. The thyrd place is out of Job. Chap. 24. <hi>Dedit ei Deus locum poenitentiae.</hi> God of his wonderfull mercy, gaue man place to doo penaunce. You vſe a Pariphraſis in this tranſlation, to make the place more forcible for your purpoſe. But thus you ſhould haue tranſlated it. God gaue him place of repentaunce. But if the Hebrewe text be of any credite with you, you wyll ſay thus. <hi>Dabit ei fidutiam, &amp; immitetur, &amp; oculi eius ſuper vias eorum.</hi> Which may be thus Engliſhed, out of this Hebrewe like Latine. Though God doo giue him boldnes, and he doth truſt therein, yet his eyes be vpon their wayes. Howe is it poſſible to picke any matter out of this text, whereby your whyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:9611:27"/>
penaunce may be vnderpropped? But this text doth rather miniſter matter againſt you. For it ſayth, that although you bee bolde, and doo truſt to you hypocriticall penaunce, yet God doth ſtil beholde your wayes. Your hypocriſie that deceiueth men, can not deceiue him. The fourth place that you alledge is (as you ſay) out of Salomons <hi>Sapientiae.</hi> 11. But if you wil giue credit to S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> that booke is <hi>Pſeudepigraphus.</hi> That is (if you vnderſtand not that worde) it hath a wrong tytle, in that it is called the Wiſedome of Salomon. Thus writeth S. <hi>Hierome, <hi>In praefatione in libros Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monis. Nonnulli ſcriptorum veterum, hunceſse Iudaei Philonis affirmant.</hi>
                  </hi> Some of the auncient wryters doo affryme, that this is the worke of <hi>Philo</hi> the Jewe. Yea and he ſaith that the very ſtile thereof doth ſauour of the Greeke eloquence. I note this, becauſe you Romaine Catholickes, doo make all the Bookes that are founde in the Byble of like authoritie.</p>
               <p>But nowe to the words of the place alledged. <hi>Diſſimulas pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta hominum, propter poenitentiam.</hi> Thou (O Lord) doſt diſſemble the ſinnes and iniquities of men, vnto the intent that they may doo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce. In the Gréeke it is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>ad poenitentiam.</hi> To repentance. The circumſtaunce of the text giueth, that God béeing mercifull to all creatures, doth not alwayes make it knowne to men that he knoweth the ſins of men, for he doth not puniſh them in haſte, but he giueth them time &amp; ſpace to remember themſelues better, and to repent, before he take in hande to puniſh them. Thys repentance is an harty ſorowe for the ſinne paſt, and a full purpoſe and earneſt endeuoure to walke in a new way in the time to come. And as for penaunce to be doone for ſatiſfaction, is altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarie, for Chriſt Jeſus hath diſcharged that matter already. But if he had not, the penaunce that we could ſuffer could not help vs. Your fyft place is taken out of Eccleſiaſticus. 2, Chapter. If the Gréeke text were not out of credite with you <hi>Rhemiſts,</hi> &amp; Romiſh Catholickes, it might ſuffice foraunſwere to this place, to ſay ſhew it in the Gréeke, and then we wyll ſay, you haue ſayde ſomewhat. But <hi>Si poenitentiam non egerimus,</hi> is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not founde in the Gréeke, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the circumſtance of the place require, nor yet well ſuffer it. For thus hath Sirach written there: <hi>Qui timent Dominum, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodiunt mandata illius: et patientiam habcbunt vſque ad inſpectionem illius, dicentes. (Si poenitentiam non egerimus) I ncidemus in manus Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi>

For according to the greatnes of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſo is his mercie with him. Héere I haue left out, (if we wyll not, or if we ſhall not repent) and yet is the ſentence of Syrach per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and the ſence good. And in the Gréeke it is thus. They that feare the Lord, will ſéeke to be accepted of him. And they that loue him, will be filled with the Lawe. They that feare the Lord, wyll prepare their harts, and will humble theyr ſoules in his ſight. Wée wyll fall into the handes of God, and not into the handes of men. For as is the greatnes of himſelfe, ſo is his mercy alſo.</p>
               <p>A man might aſke héere, what néede there is of this ſentence, <hi>Si poenitentiam non egerimus:</hi> If we repent not, or as you wyll haue it, if wée doo not penaunce.

               <p>You procéede in your purpoſe, and thus you ſay.

I can not thinke that your ſelfe reading the wordes in <hi>Luke,</hi> the 13.

The wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des that the Euangeliſt writeth, were ſpoken by our Sauior him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. The occaſion was, a report made vnto him, of the crueltye that Pilate vſed towards certaine of the Galileans. Doo you think (ſayth our Sauiour) that theſe Galileans were greater ſinners, then the reſt of the Galileans were: I tell you no. But except you haue repentance, you ſhal all in like maner periſh. And heere one other thing wherein your notes haue deceiued you. The text hath thus. <hi>Sed niſi poenitentiam habueritis.</hi> But except you haue repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce. And you following your notes (as I ſuppoſe, for I can hardlie be perſwaded, that ſéeing the text, you would ſo mangle it) doo ſet it downe thus. <hi>Sinon feceritis poenitentiam:</hi> If you doo not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, you ſhall periſh altogether.

But hetherto, you ſhewe your ſelfe to be perſwaded, that you haue not without iuſt cauſe taken vpon you the life of a <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me</hi> Fryer. But howe well you haue prooued this, by thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that you haue (for that purpoſe) alledged: I think your ſelfe doo nowe ſée, and are aſhamed that euer you tooke this enterpriſe in hande.</p>
               <p>Thus much for aunſwere to that long diſcourſe that you haue made, concerning your departing from your parents, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thereof. Your long and labourſome trauell in Fraunce, before you could créepe into the habite (or wéede as you terme it) of a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nime</hi> Fryer, and howe you behaued your ſelfe in all that weary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome trauaile. And laſt of all, howe happy a man you thinke your ſelfe to be, for that you are now wéeded (as you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> terme it) with that wéede, and haue ſo played the part of a Nouice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that lyking, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well liked of the Fryers of that Order, you are nowe a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Fryer, and haue changed your name, and are no more called Samuell Debnam, but Fryer John Frauncis, and therefore like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſo to liue during your naturall life.</p>
               <p>But nowe we haue another Crowe to pull. You haue made a meruailous inuectiue againſt our Religion, with an earneſt and pithy exhortation to your Parents, to forſake both our Religion and vs alſo. And laſt of all, a very Chriſtian inſtruction (as you ſéeme to be perſwaded) but indéede a very Antichriſtian direction, howe they may and ought to behaue themſelues, in this caſe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they doo nowe liue, and are likely to continue.

               <p>I would gladly ſtay my penne, from blotting my paper with bitter or opprobrious wordes, but (alas) I can not, for the fire of zeale towards Gods glory, is ſo kindled in myne harte, that I can not hold in, ſuch ſpéeches as this blaſphemer deſerueth.

harts: whereby we are mooued to ſéeke to knowe his wyll, and to ſerue him according to his wyll. The foundation of this Religion, is the Law of God, and the Goſpell of Chriſt. For the Lawe dooth worke in vs feare, and the Goſpell worketh loue. By the lawe, we are ſeruants, but by the Goſpell we are children, that is, adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue ſonnes and daughters, of God himſelfe, and inheritors of hys kingdome, and heyres annexed with Jeſus Chriſt, his onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Sonne. This Law did God himſelfe wryte, firſt in the hart of the firſt man, in his firſt creation, and after in Tables of ſtone, and deliuered the ſame to Moſes, as his eſpeciall and choſen Miniſter, that by his miniſtration, it might bee made knowne to his people, the poſteritie of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob.</hi> And the ſame Law, is by the finger of God written in our harts in our regeneration or newe byrth, wherein we are borne from aboue, by water, and by the holy Ghoſt: hauing receiued the ſpirite of Chriſt, which crieth in our harts to the heauenly maieſty, <hi>Abba Pater,</hi> Father, father.

And afterward he preached it amongſt the nations of the world, by the miniſtry of his Apoſtles or meſſengers. And thus the knowledge

Howe dare you now ſay that the foundation of our Religion is the deuill of hell? Is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill of hell, the Lawe and the Goſpell?

So their duety was to be carefull to leade a righteous life before men, and not be bolde to commit ſinne, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God had in mercy diſcharged them of ſin) but to liue in awe, and a reuerent childlike feare of his iuſtice, as they that would ſhewe themſelues continually thankfull for his mercy, in making their owne bodies a Sacrifice to God, lyuing holy and acceptable vnto God, as theyr reaſonable ſeruing of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 11. 12. And euen ſo doo wée.

               <p>Thus you may ſée, that we are not departed from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Romaine Church, which was in the time of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> but from you, that departed from them, more then 1000. yéeres before this day.

               <p>For the firſt, (ſayth he) that is to ſay prayers for the dead: becauſe you admit not the words which the holy Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Catholike Church haue ſpoken: I wyll turne you to the Byble it ſelfe. Which if you dare either plainly deny, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete falſely: you are nowe no longer heretickes, but playne Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels. Looke therefore I beſeeche you, in the 12. Chapter of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde booke of Machabees, towards the ende of the Chapter, you ſhall there finde, howe a Captayne of the Iewiſh Armie, named Iudas, made a collection of money to be offered at Ieruſalem, for the ſinnes of thoſe Souldiours, which for a good and iuſt quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, were ſlayne in battaile. Furdermore, if you wyll take the paynes to reade the latter words of the ſame Chapter, you ſhall finde the concluſion of the ſame Chapter to be this. <hi>Sancta ergo, et ſalubris est cogitatio, pro defunctis exorare, vt a peccatis ſoluantur.</hi> It is (ſayth he) therefore, a holy, and a wholſome thought, to pray for the dead, that they may be releaſed from their ſinnes. Tell me not nowe (I pray you) a tale of a tubbe, with a quote in the margnet, ſaying: That the foreſayd place of holy Scripture, was not written by the holy Ghoſt. For if ſo be that you be come to that point, as to belye the holy. Scripture, well may it be ſayde of you, which is written by holye Eſay, in his booke of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.

               <p>In vewing the Forte of our fayth, you ſéeme to haue determined to batter foure of the eſpeciall Bulworkes thereof. Namely, the denyall of Prayers for the dead. The denial of works to be meritorious of ſaluation. The denyall of the reall preſence of the body and blood of Chriſt in the bleſſed Sacrament of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar. And the denying that there be any moe Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts then two. To batter theſe Bulworkes, you will not bring any Ordinaunce taken out of the Storchouſe of the holie Fathers, but you wyll vſe that great forcible Ordinaunce, that is to be had in the Storehouſe of the holye Bible: and therewith you wil batter and beate down the ſtrongeſt parts of our Forte of Faith. Againſt the firſt Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke, you plant a péece of Ordinaunce taken out of the 12. Chap. of the ſeconde booke of <hi>Machabees.</hi> Againſt the ſeconde Bulworke, 2. péeces of Ordinaunce, one taken out of the Epiſtle of S. <hi>Iames,</hi> and the other out of the 25. Chapter of S. <hi>Mathewes</hi> Goſpell. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the third, you doo plant foure péeces of Ordinaunce, one ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the 26. Chap. of S. <hi>Mathew,</hi> one other taken out of the 14. Chapter of S. <hi>Marke,</hi> the third out of the 22. of S. <hi>Luke.</hi> and the fourth you take out of the ſixt Chap. of S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Goſpell. But againſt the fourth Bulworke. you bring no Ordinaunce at all, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the Storehouſe of the Bible, nor out of the Storehouſe of the holie Doctors of the Catholicke Church. Onely you ſay, that it is an hereſie condemned long ago.</p>
               <p>But let vs ſée, of what force theſe péeces of Ordinaunce be. The firſt ſéemeth a farre off, to be a double Cannon of great force. But at hand, it is founde to be but a ſillie Baſe, emboſſed and made great, by cunning clowting together of Paſte made of paper, in the forme of a double Cannon, with the colour of Braſſe cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly layde vpon it. Who would not thinke that this were a Cannon of great force, when he ſhall heare the Captaine himſelfe ſay. I will turne you to the Bible it ſelfe? which if you dare either deny. &amp;c. you ſhalbe no longer Heretickes, but plaine Infidels. Looke I beſéeche you. &amp;c.

is. Firſt, becauſe Fryer John dooth charge vs, that we admitt not the words which the holy Doctors of the Catholicke Church haue ſpoken: I require him to reade that which S. <hi>Ierome</hi> hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, in his preface vpon the bookes of Salomon, immediatly after thoſe wordes that I put you in minde of when I anſwered to that ſentence that you alledged out of the booke of Wiſedome, Chap. 11. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> writeth thus. <hi>Sicut ergo Judeth, &amp; Tobiae, &amp; Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beorum libros, legit quidem Eccleſia, ſed eos inter canonicas ſcripturas non recipit, ſic &amp; baec duo volumina legat, ad edificationem plebis: non ad authoritatem eccleſiasticorum dogmatum confirmandam.</hi> Euen as the Church dooth (indéede) reade the bookes of <hi>Iudith</hi> and <hi>Tobias,</hi> and of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> but dooth not receiue them amongſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall Scriptures, euen ſo ſhe may reade theſe two bookes (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the booke of <hi>Wiſedome</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi>) to the edifying of the people, but not for the confirming of Eccleſiaſticall doctrine. Loe (Maſter Frier John) one of the holie Doctors of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Church, hath tolde you, that this Scripture was not written by the holie Ghoſt, and yet I trowe you will not ſay that he hath tolde you a tale of a tubbe, nor that he hath belyed the holy Ghoſt, or that the ſaying of the holie <hi>Eſay,</hi> may be well applied vnto him. But if your ſelfe would vouchſafe to reade the laſt lynes of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde Booke of <hi>Machabees,</hi> I thinke you woulde not thinke this booke to be of ſuch authority as hetherto, you haue in theſe writings ſéemed to thinke. For in the wordes written in thoſe lynes, the author or writer of this booke, dooth ſhewe himſelf to be in doubt whether he haue doone ſo well as himſelfe wiſhed to doo: and in caſe he haue not doone ſo well, he craueth pardon of his Readers, and vſeth a ſimilitude to perſwade him to pardon him. Which is a thing all together vnſéemely to be doone by the holie Ghoſte. Yea I ſuppoſe your ſelfe woulde account it blaſphemie, in him that wold ſay, that the holy Ghoſt may doubt whether ought that he doth bée well doone or not. And if you will take the paines to reade the latter part of the 14. Chapter of this booke, you ſhall finde there a great commendation giuen to one <hi>Razias,</hi> for that he murthered himſelfe, which commendation could not come from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Ghoſt. For ſuch murder is not onelie contrarie to the expreſſe commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of GOD, but it is contrarie to nature alſo. Yea, and I doo yet thinke, that though you doo thinke, that you doo deſerue much
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:9611:36"/>
at Gods hande by whypping your ſelfe with your diſcipline (as your ſelfe doo report) yet you are not perſwaded that you ſhoulde deſerue more, if either by whipping your ſelfe or otherwiſe, you ſhoulde kill your ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, if your ſelfe be not of that number that <hi>Eſay</hi> the Prophet ſpeaketh of in the ſixt Chapter of his booke (cited by your ſelfe) then there is hope that you will not ſticke to reade, &amp; weigh the circumſtaunces of the place in the 12. of this ſecond booke of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> that you doo ſo much vrge vs with. In the text that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth immediatlie before that, which you doo beſéeche vs to looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the Hiſtorian hath ſaide, that after the Armie of <hi>Gorsias</hi> was by the mighty power of God put to flight, Iudas (hauing gathered his Army together) came to the Cittie <hi>Odolla.</hi> And when the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth day was come, and they were purified according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, they did in the ſame place ſpende the time of the Sabaothe. And the next day following, Iudas came with his company to take vp the dead bodies of them that were ſlaine, and to bury the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with their fathers, in the buriall places that belonged to them. And they founde vnder the garments of them that were flayne, certain of the gifts that had béene offered to the Idolles that were at <hi>Iam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> from which the Lawe commaunded the Iewes to abſtaine. It was therefore made manifeſt to all men, that this was the cauſe wherefore they were ſlayne. The whole company did therefore commende the iuſt iudgment of the Lord, which had made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the déedes that had béene hidde and kept in ſecrete. And ſo they gaue themſelues to prayer, and beſought God that the fault which was committed might be blotted out of memory. But the moſte valiant man <hi>Iudas,</hi> exhorted the people to kéepe themſelues wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne, hauing euen before their eyes, thoſe things that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened for the ſinnes of thoſe that were ſlayne. And hauing ended his Collation, he ſent to Jeruſalem, xii. thouſande drachmas of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that ſacrifice might be offered for the ſinnes of them that were deade.</p>
               <p>Thus farre goeth the report of that which was doone by <hi>Iudas</hi> that Captaine of the Jewiſh Armie that you ſpeake of. I haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this text out of the tranſlation that is allowed by the decrée of the <hi>Tridentine Councell,</hi> which tranſlation, you may not diſalow of, for if you doo: you ſhalbe amongſt them that the fathers of that
<pb facs="tcp:9611:37"/>
Counſell haue <hi>Anathematized.</hi> Take héede therefore, that you haue not offended already, in that you haue ſaid, that the Captain made a Collection, where your text ſayth, <hi>facta collatione.</hi> I know that our tranſlators that haue tranſlated into the Engliſh, haue ſayd as you haue doone. Hauing made a collection of monye, ſent it to Jeruſalem. &amp;c. In the Gréeke, the ſence is vncertaine, and hard<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lie can there any perfect ſence be gathered in this place. And this one thing I muſt note, that where this <hi>vulgare</hi> tranſlation hath twelue thouſande Drachmas, the Gréeke hath but two thouſande Drachmas, which together with the reſt of the circumſtaunces of the text, doo cauſe me to thinke, that Iudas néeded not to make any collection of mony to be ſent to Jeruſalem. For the ſumme bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no greater, he might very well ſpare it out of his owne trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure (as it may be ſuppoſed.) Hauing therefore ended that Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or concion which he made to his whole company of Souldiers that then were about him, (wherein he exhorted them, to conſider of that which had happened, and to take warning thereby, to bee carefull to kéepe themſelues from ſinne, leaſt the like ſhoulde fall vpon them alſo) he ſent that ſumme of mony to Jeruſalem, that Sacrifice might be offered there for the ſinnes of them that were deade. Slayne (as you ſay) for a good and a iuſt quarrell, but the Hiſtorie ſaith, that the iuſt iudgment of the Lorde was executed vppon them, for that they had ſtolen and hidde vnder theyr Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, thinges that hadde béene offered to thoſe Idolles that were at Iamnia, which was by the Lawe forbidden to be doone. But what? would you haue vs to think (as it may ſéeme you doo think) that <hi>Iudas Machabeus</hi> (béeing a man ſo preciſe in obſeruing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law of God, as in this Hiſtory it appeareth that he was) would cauſe any newe kinde of Sacrifice to bée deuiſed, or that he would cauſe any of thoſe Sacrifices that Moſes had by Gods direction comman<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded to be offered, to be vſed for any other purpoſe, then for thoſe purpoſes that God himſelfe had ordeyned them for? If you wyll reade the whole <hi>Leuiticall</hi> Lawe throughout, you ſhall not finde that euer God did commaunde any ſacrifice to be offered for ſinne other then that which is called a ſinne offering: and was to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for penitent ſinners, in ſuch ſort as the Law preſcribeth, which was, in the preſence of the penitent ſinner himſelfe, laying hys hand vpon the heade of the ſacrificed beaſt, thereby ſignifying that

The Sacrifice therefore which <hi>Iudas</hi> would haue to be offered at Jeruſalem, muſt néedes be of that kind which was called a peace offering, and was to be vſed for the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying of Gods wrath, which ſhould at anytime, by any occ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">

And by the Hiſtoricall fayth, we can not be better then are the deuils, in whom that faith bringeth forth, an horrible feare of iudgment, which muſt néedes be ioyned wyth hatred. So that they which haue none other fayth but that, muſt néedes hate God, as the deuill doth. We doo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude with S. <hi>Iames,</hi> that man is iuſtified by workes, and not by fayth onely. By workes was Abraham iuſtified before men, when his fayth had brought forth her fruite, which was obedience to the commaundement (Take thy ſonne <hi>Iſaac.</hi> &amp;c.) which obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſprang out of that Fayth that S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>Qui contra ſpem, in ſpem credidit,</hi> which beléeued in hope, euen contrarye to hope.

If you lyſt to appoſe your ſelfe againſt S. <hi>Paule</hi> you may, and in the ende haue the foyle. S. <hi>Iames</hi> doth not, but

meaneth to mooue Chriſtians, not to make an account of any other fayth, then that which worketh by loue. We will hold with Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> and not oppoſe our ſelues againſt S. <hi>Paul</hi> with you. Wée doo ſée that theſe two Apoſtles, being ledde by one ſpirit of Chriſt, agrée in one. Although <hi>Paule</hi> doo ſay: <hi>Arbitramur enim, iustificari hominem per fidem, ſine operibus legis.</hi> We ſuppoſe that man is iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Fayth, without the déedes of the Law. <hi>Rom</hi> 3.

Where it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that our bleſſed Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, in the latter day giuing the finall and euerlaſting ſentence (as well vnto the ſaued as vnto the damned) ſhall vtter theſe wordes. <hi>Venite benedicti patris mei</hi>

For (ſayth he) when I was hungry, you fed mee, when I was a thyrſt, you gaue me to drinke, when I was naked ye clothed me: but what are theſe things if they be not good works? Therefore, and by this place of Scripture, good workes are meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious to our Saluation. Reade likewiſe (I pray you) the ſecond Chapter of the Epiſtle of S. Paule to the Remaines, a little way of from the beginning. You ſhall there finde, howe God will reward all men according to their workes. The ſame alſo, if you wyll ſearch, you ſhall find, in the xvi. Chap. of S. Mathew, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places of the Scripture. I doo not conclude by theſe partes of the Newe teſtament, that by good workes onely wee are ſaued, but mine intention is to proue, that neither by faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good workes, nor by good workes without fayth, we are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified or ſaued.</p>

Thus hath <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> wrytten, as the concluſion of all that hée hath written before in commendation of thoſe that feede the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, giue drinke to the thirſty, clothe the naked. &amp;c. and in diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of them that leaue thoſe workes vndoone.

haue doone a thouſande ſuch workes, yet they ſhalbe crowned through frée mercie: for that bountifull liberality, is altogether of frée mercy.

For when I was hungry, you fedde me, when I was thirſty ye gaue me to drink, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I was naked, you clothed me: but what are theſe thinges, if they be not good workes?

If you coulde prooue, or if we would yéelde vnto you, that theſe good workes were the efficient cauſe of the giuing of this ioyfull ſentence (which neither is confeſſed by vs, nor can be prooued by you,) then might your concluſion be allowed of, in the Schooles amongſt Schollers. But ſéeing that all men which haue knowledge to diſcerne one cauſe from another, muſt néedes confeſſe, that theſe workes be but <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And you ſay furder, that if we will ſearche, we ſhall finde the ſame moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently, in the xvi. of S. <hi>Mathewes</hi> Goſpell, and in many other places of holie Scripture. You might very well haue ſpared this laboure. For we knewe before you were borne, that, both in thoſe places that you name, and in many other places of holy ſcriptures, it appeareth euidently, that God will giue vnto all men (or as you terme it, rewarde all men) according to their works. But what can you conclude vpon this? Shall we therefore ſay that workes are the efficient cauſe of our ſaluation? your ſelfe doo deny it. For you ſay thus. I doo not conclude by theſe parts of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that by good workes onely we are ſaued: but mine intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to prooue, that neither by faith without good workes, nor by good workes without faith, we are iuſtified or ſaued. Héere you haue flatly denied, that which you haue before, as flatly affyrmed. For before you haue ſayd, that our Sauiour Chriſt ſheweth the cauſe of the ioyfull ſentence, which he ſhall giue when he ſhal ſay:
<pb facs="tcp:9611:42"/>
Come ye bleſſed of my Father. &amp;c. Wherein you affirme (as before I haue prooued) that the good workes that our Sauiour maketh rehearſall of, are the efficient cauſe of gyuing that ſentence, and ſo by good conſequence of our iuſtification or ſaluation. And nowe you ſay that you conclude not ſo, but that good workes and faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, are the efficient cauſe of our iuſtification or ſaluation. For ſo men of your ſorte doo meane, by that manner of ſpéeche, that you doo vſe héere, when you ſay, by workes or by fayth.</p>
               <p>But we haue another meaning of that ſpéeche, as I will (by Gods helpe) let you vnderſtand. When S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth thus. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>Arbitramur enim iuſtificars hominem per fidem, ſine operibus legis.</hi> We ſuppoſe that man is iuſtified by faith without the déedes of the Lawe. His meaning is, that faith is the inſtrument y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God vſeth in making vs righteous. Gods frée mercy is the efficient cauſe, and our faith is the inſtrumentall cauſe of our iuſtification. So that God dooth make vs righteous, by that fayth that himſelfe hath wrought in vs by the word of his Goſpell, which is, <hi>Virtus Dei in ſalutem omni credenti. <hi>Rom.</hi>
                  </hi> 1. The power of God, to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to euery one that beléeueth.</p>
               <p>Thus we may ſée that the word of the Goſpell, is the inſtrument that God vſeth in making vs faithfull, and faith is the inſtrument whereby he maketh vs righteous. <hi>Fdes ex auditu: auditus autem per verbum Chriſti. <hi>Rom.</hi>
                  </hi> 10. Fayth commeth by hearing, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring commeth by the worde of Chriſt (or as the Gréeke hath it, of God.) So that the worde that is preached, and the Preacher that preacheth, are Gods outward inſtruments, which he vſeth in wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king fayth in the hartes of the hearers. And in this meaning S. <hi>Paul</hi> writeth thus to <hi>Timothe. 1. Tim.</hi> 4. <hi>Attende tibi &amp; doctrinae inſta in illis. Hoc enim faciens: et teipſum ſalum facies, et eos qui te au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diunt.</hi> Take héede to thy ſelfe, and vnto doctrine: be inſtant or ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt therein: for in dooing this thing, thou ſhalt ſaue thy ſelfe, and them that heare thée. Héere we ſée that <hi>Timothe</hi> being careful in looking to hys owne lyfe, and to the ſoundnes of his doctrine, and being earneſtly bent to teache both by good example of life, and by ſownde doctrine, is by S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſayd to be, the ſauiour of himſelfe and of them that heare him. And yet it is manifeſt, that he was neither the ſauiour of himſelfe, nor of any other, but an inſtrument that God vſed in working ſaluation, both in himſelfe and in other. Becauſe that by his carefull diligence in looking to his owne lyfe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:9611:42"/>
and ſowndnes of doctrine, and by his earneſtnes in preaching the ſame, fayth was begunne, and increaſed in his hearers, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued and confirmed in himſelfe. Which fayth, both in him &amp; in his hearers, layd holde vpon, and heldfaſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mercifull promiſe of God, made in the mediation of the onely Mediator betwixt GOD and man, euen the man Chriſt Ieſus our Lorde. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. And ſo bothe <hi>Timothe,</hi> hys hearers, and all the reſt, that haue béene, are, or ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bée by Gods good meanes made faithful, are by Gods frée mercy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: according to the ſaying of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Epheſians.</hi> Cha. 2. <hi>Gratia enim estis ſaluati per fidem: et hoc non ex vobis. Dei enim do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num est: non ex operibus, vt nequis glorietur. Ipſius enim ſumus fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura, creati in Christo Ieſu ad opera bona, quae preparauit Deus, vt in illis ambulemus.</hi> By Grace are you ſaued, through fayth, and that not of your ſelues, for it is Gods gyft: not of workes leaſt any man ſhoulde boaſte. For we are hys workmanſhyppe, created in Chriſt Ieſus vnto good workes, which God hath prepared, that we ſhoulde walke in them. And to the <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. Chapter. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſayth thus. <hi>Non volentis ne<expan>

It ſéemeth to me a ſtrange thing, that any man (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the Religion of Chriſt) dare conclude (as you doo) ſo direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to the expreſſe wordes of the Apoſtle <hi>Paule.</hi> You ſay in your concluſion, we are iuſtified or ſaued, by fayth &amp; good works together. S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth. Wée ſuppoſe that man is iuſtified by fayth without the déedes of the Lawe. Nowe, if you can teil vs of any déedes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are of more force to make vs righteous before God, then the déedes that God hath commaunded in his Law: then haue you ſayd ſomewhat, although but a little. For thoſe déedes muſt bée déedes commaunded of men, whereof the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> writeth thus. Chap. 29. Theyr feare towards me was taught by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of men: therefore, beholde, I wyll take in hand to worke a ſtrange worke, that ſhall be a miracle, and an aſtoniſhment to this people: For wyſemen ſhall looſe their wiſedome, and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſhalbe hydde from the prudent. I would wyſh you to weighe well theſe wordes of the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> and to conſider whether they be not already verified in you, and in men of your ſorte. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider alſo what our ſauiour Chriſt addeth to theſe wordes. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. In vayne doo they worſhip me, teaching the doctrines and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of men. Whereby we are admoniſhed, that it is
<pb facs="tcp:9611:43"/>
but loſt labour, for a man to goe about to be made righteous before God, by ſuch workes, as men doo or can deuiſe and commaund. S. Paule to the <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2. ſayth: That through fayth wee are ſaued by frée mercie, and that not of our ſelues. For it is the gyft of GOD, and commeth not of workes, leaſt any man might haue any occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to boaſt: and how dare any man conclude (as you doo) that faith and works coupled together, may make vs righteous before God. I doo therfore conclude, according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true meaning of the wordes of our ſauiour Chriſt, the Prophet Eſay, and the Apoſtle Paul, that neither the workes that God hath commaunded, nor the workes that men haue deuiſed, or can deuiſe and commaund, yea or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith that God hath, dooth or ſhall worke in the harts of men, either bée, or can be, the efficient cauſe of mans righteouſnes or ſaluation. But the frée mercy of God onely, is the alone efficient cauſe, that hath wrought, doth and ſhall worke, ſaluation in the faithful one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in none other. In whom he himſelfe worketh faith, that by that fayth they may laie hold vpon, &amp; holde faſt that ſaluation, that in frée mercy, he doth, and will fréely beſtowe vpon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der I conclude, that though the workes that GOD hath prepared for the faithfull to walke in, neither be, nor can be, the efficient cauſe of ſaluation, yet they are <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non:</hi> that is, a cauſe that muſt be founde in them, to whom it ſhalbe ſayde. Come yee bleſſed of my Father &amp;c. ſo that they that ſhall heare that ioyfull ſentence, muſt hunger and thirſt after righteouſnes of life, all the dayes of their life. And vſe that faith that GOD hath wrought in them, in laying holde vpon, and holding faſt, that righteouſnes that God hath in frée mercy beſtowed fréely vpon them, hauing a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall care to ſhewe themſelues thankfull to him for the ſame, by walking in thoſe good workes that hee hath prepared for them to walke in.</p>
               <p>Nowe for the meaning of thoſe places that you direct vs vnto, namely, the 2. to the <hi>Romans,</hi> the 16. of S. <hi>Mathew,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wherin we may by ſearch find, how God will reward al men according to their works: I ſay thus. I could by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledg that God hath giuen me, anſwere you ſufficiently. Yet becauſe my wordes be of ſmall credite with you, I wyll aunſwere you by the wordes of a holy father of the Catholicke Church, whoſe wordes (I hope) you will admit, and giue credite to them (although<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as I

And when God doth crowne our merits, he crowneth none other thing but his owne gifts? Thus writeth S. <hi>Augustine</hi> Tom. 2. <hi>Epiſtola.</hi> 105. And againe in his 7. Tom. in the 7. Chap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ter of his booke <hi>De gratia &amp; libero arbitrio,</hi> he wryteth thus. <hi>Si ergo Dei dona ſunt bona merita tua: non Deus coronat merita tua, tanqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> merita tua, ſed tanquam dona ſua.</hi> That is, If therefore thy good merites be the gyfts of God, then dooth not God crowne thy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites as thy merites, but as his owne gifts.

Therefore, as after a certaine manner, the ſacrament of the body of Chriſt is the body of Chriſt, and the Sacrament of the bloude of Chriſt, is the bloud of Chriſt: euen ſo, the ſacrament of fayth is fayth &amp;c. Thus you may ſée, and as I thinke, you doo ſée, that theſe words, This is my body, doo not proue any other preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament, then that which may be called ſacramentall, myſticall, heauenly, and ſpirituall. And to make this matter more plaine vnto you: I wyll let you ſée certaine places of Scripture, where the like ſpéeche is vſed, and in the like meaning. <hi>Ezechiell</hi> the Prophet, is commaunded to ſhaue of the hayre of his heade and beard, to deuide it into thrée equall partes &amp;c.

                  </hi> That is to ſay. Your Fathers did eate Manna and are deade: not becauſe Manna was an euill thing, but becauſe they did not eate it aright.

but in the thing that is ſignified they are alike. Gyue care to the Apoſtle. For he ſayth, Brethren, I would not haue you igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that all our Fathers were vnder the Clowde, and that they did all paſſe thorow the Sea, and that they were all baptized by Moſes, in the clowde, and in the Sea, and that they did all eate one and the ſame ſpirituall meate. The ſame ſpirituall meate indéede, for the corporall was another, for they did eate Manna, and we an other thing: but the ſpirituall was the ſame that we doo eate. But theſe were our Fathers, not theirs. They to whom we are like, not they to whom they were like. And hée addeth to this. And they did all drinke of one ſpirituall drinke, but in the viſible kind, they did drinke one thing and we another, and yet ſignifying the ſelf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They dranke (ſayth he) of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirituall Rocke that followed them, and that Rocke was Chriſt. Hence was the bread, and hence was the drinke.

And what? wyll you haue vs to grant you a reall preſence of Chriſtes bodie and bloode in the Manna and in the Rocke? And howe can you then require vs to grant it, in the ſacramentall bread &amp; wine? S. Auſten ſayth, that they and we differ not in the thing ſignified, although we differ in the ſignes. Theyr ſignes were Manna and the Rocke, or water that iſhewed out of the Rocke, and our ſignes are the Breade and the Cuppe, or the wyne vſed in the Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. But the ſpirituall meate and drinke, that both they and wee doo eate and drinke, is the very body and bloud of Chriſt, that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Lambe that hath béene ſlaine for the ſinnes of the world, euen from the beginning of the world.

No body but ſuch as dwell in Chriſt, and haue Chriſt dwelling in them, eyther doo or can eate the fleſh of Chriſt, but doo by the receiuing of the Sacrament of ſo excellent a thing, eate and drinke to their owne condemnation. Nowe, I leaue you, to try this matter with S. Auſten. If you can entreate him to recant: ſo it is. If not, your beſt way is, to recant your ſelfe. And yet one other ſentence of S.

God a lyar, and doo holde an hereſie, moſt horrible, deteſtable, and abhominable. Where as in very déede, we doo beléeue and teache, the true, auncient, Catholicke, and Apoſtolicke fayth, concerning the true vſe of the Sacrament of the body and bloude of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt.

Come out from amongſt them, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken no more to them, they are falſe Prophets, deſtruction hangeth ouer their heads, and hell gapeth for them. They robbe Chriſte of his glory.

               <p>But to returne to our purpoſe. You ſay that we ſay, that there be but two Sacraments, an hereſie condemned long agoe. But you tell vs not when, where, nor by whom. Therefore as we haue ſayd, ſo we doo ſay, and ſo we wyll ſay (by Gods helpe) til you can prooue the contrary: that Chriſt hath ordeined but two ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to be vſed by Chriſtians. Your ſaying, that it is an hereſie condem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned long agoe, is but a flaſhe of falſe fire giuen to a péece of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce vncharged, and therefore can not hurt the Bulwork wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we ſtande, and doo denie that Chriſt hath ordeined any moe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments then two, namely: Baptiſme and the ſupper of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord. In his thyrd booke of Chriſtian doctrine, and in the 9. Chap. there of, S.

Lorde and the Apoſtolicke diſcipline hath giuen vnto vs, a certain ſmall number, and the ſame very eaſie to be doone, and moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in ſignification, and moſt pure in obſeruation: as is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptiſme, and the celebration of the body and bloud of the Lorde, which euery man that is inſtructed, doth when hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth them, knowe to what ende they are referred, that he may reuerence them, not in a carnall ſeruitude, but rather in a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all liberty.

               <p>In theſe wordes of S. Auſten, we haue occaſion to note two thinges eſpecially. One is, that hee did not knowe of moe Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then two, inſtituted by our Sauiour Chriſt, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by him and his Apoſtles to be vſed in his Church. The other is, that it is a poynt of fleſhly ſeruitude, and not of Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, for a man to follow the letter, or litterall ſence, in thoſe ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the Scriptures, that doo concerne thoſe two Sacraments, in ſuch ſorte that he wyll take the ſignes that are ſpoken of, for the thinges ſignified by them. A man may meruell, that any of your ſorte, that knoweth theſe words of S. Auſten: can allowe him for a Catholicke, and yet condemne vs, as Heretickes in thys poynt, wherein we doo both affyrme and denie, euen as he hath doone ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye hundrethes of yéeres before vs.</p>
               <p>But let vs ſée yet, one other place of S. Auſten. In an Epiſtle that he wrote to one <hi>Ianuarius,</hi> which is in number 118. S. Auſten wryteth thus. <hi>Primò ita<expan>

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:9611:52"/>
eaſie yoke, and light burden. Whereby he hath ſyed together the ſociety of the newe people, with Sacraments that are feweſt in number, eaſieſt in obſeruing, and moſt excellent in ſignification, as is Baptiſme, conſecrated in the name of the Trinity, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of his body and bloud, and if there by any other ſacrament that is in the Canonicall Scriptures commended, except thoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, which did encreaſe the weight of bondage of the olde people, as was méete for theyr hartes, and for the propheticall time, and which are reade in the fiue Bookes of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe wordes of S. Auſten, we haue occaſion to note, that his meaning was to certifie <hi>Ianuarius</hi> (to whom he wrote this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle) of that thing which our Lord Ieſus Chriſt taught, in that which ſtandeth written in the eleuenth of ſaynt <hi>Mathewes</hi> Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: concerning the eaſines of the yoke, and the lightnes of the burden, that Chriſt Ieſus hath layde vpon Chriſtians. And for the explaning of hys meaning: he ſayth that our Sacraments are very fewe in number, very eaſie to be obſerued, and moſt excellent in ſignification. And hee nameth onely Baptiſme and the ſupper of the Lorde, which he calleth (as we commonly doo) the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the body and bloode of our Sauiour Chriſt. And furder, hee referreth him to the Canonicall ſcriptures, as aduiſing him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue no moe Sacraments, then he ſhall finde to be commended in them. And leaſt he might take occaſion by thoſe words, to thinke that Chriſtians ought to be circumciſed, and to obſerue the ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ceremonies of <hi>Moſes</hi> Lawe: he excepteth all ſuch Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as were layde vpon the people of the olde Lawe, by any thing that is wrytten in any of the fiue bookes of <hi>Moſes.</hi> So that, by theſe wordes of thys learned Father ſaynt Auſten, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth (as by the other afore rehearſed) that he was not perſwaded, that Chriſt Ieſus our Lord, hath layde vpon vs Chriſtians, that heauye burden of ſeauen Sacraments, which your holy father the Pope, layeth vpon you, and vpon all hys Antichriſtian flocke. Confirmation, Order, Repentance, or (as you call it) Penaunce, Matrimonie, and the Viſitation of the ſicke (which you call Extreme vnction) we vſe, as good, profitable, and neceſſary vſages in the Church of Chriſt, but not as Sacraments: becauſe it appea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth not in any Canonicall ſcripture, that Chriſt our ſauiour hath inſtituted them, and commaunded them to be vſed as ſacraments.
<pb facs="tcp:9611:53"/>
Neyther doo they agree with that definition or deſcription of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, which is commonly allowed of amongſt the learned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is thus. A Sacrament is an outwarde and viſible ſigne, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting an inwarde, inuiſible ſpirituall grace, ordeyned by Chryſte himſelfe, to teſtify Gods good wyll and bountifulnes towards vs, through the ſame Chriſt our ſauiour, by which Gods promiſes, touching forgiuenes of ſinnes, &amp; eternall ſaluation, giuen through Chriſt, are (as it were) ſealed, and the trueth of them, is more cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tainly confirmed in our hartes. To thys definition or deſcription onely Baptiſme, and the Lords ſupper doo agrée: therefore they onely, are properly to be called ſacraments. Otherwyſe, a ſigne of a holy thing may be called a ſacrament. But in that large ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the worde ſacrament, there be not onely ſeauen ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but ſeauenty times ſeauen ſacraments. And in that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning we deny not, but that there may be in euery one of theſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fiue, which you call ſacraments, moe ſacraments then one or two. But I can not meruell enough at this one thinge, that men of your ſorte, can eſtéeme ſo highly of Matrimonie, as to make it a ſacrament of ſuch excellencie, and yet bynde all your holieſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes by a ſolemne vowe, neuer to vſe it, or to take any bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite by it. Yea, I meruell that you can account matrimony ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a thing as a ſacrament, and yet maryed perſons ſo vnholy, that if any of them ſhall come into any of your moſt holy Cloyſters, the walles and floores thereof muſt be waſhed, as thinges polluted, by the preſence of thoſe marryed perſons. Howeſoeuer therefore, by whom ſoeuer, or whereſoeuer, that which wee holde concerning two ſacraments onely, hath béene condemned for hereſie: we doo ſtyll holde it, and minde ſtyll to holde it for right Religion, tyll Fryer Iohn, and hys fraternitie, can and ſhall by the Cannonicall ſcriptures prooue it hereſye, and ſaynt Auguſtine an Hereticke.</p>

Our mother hath tolde vs, that our father hath forbidden vs to take his name in vaine, and that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded vs to ſweare by him onely, and not by anie other: But your mother teacheth you to ſweare by your idolatrous maſſe, by your ſaints, and by the Images of your ſaints, and to profane the bleſſed name of God, in making your ſuperſtitious vowes, and in all your exorciſmes, &amp; coniurations. Our mother hath told vs that our fathers will is, that we ſhould ſpende the Saboth day holilie, and not to profane it in anie condition. But your mother telleth you, that you may daunce, dallie and ſporte and plaie, bayt Bulles and Beares, and giue your ſelues to all other paſtimes on the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bothe daie, ſo that you diſpatche your Idolatrous ſeruice in your Churches, either before or after, but you muſt in any caſe take heede, that you giue not your ſelf to any good exerciſe in that day.

But your mother teacheth you to ſay <hi>Corban,</hi> as the Phareſyes taught theyr Schollers, when our Sauiour Chriſt was amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Let your olde Father and Mother, (Iohn and Catherine Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam) ſterue in England, by reaſon that being aged and impotent, they can not by laboure procure thinges néedefull, as in youth they did, and fedde both themſelues and you, with the reſt of theyr chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: Theyr ſonne Samuell muſt (if he will hearken to his new mother of <hi>Rome</hi>) liue ſtill in Fraunce, béeing fedde and ſuſtayned by the labour of others, and write to his Father and Mother (bee their caſe neuer ſo harde) that he muſt faſt and pray, and whippe himſelfe for their ſinnes, and obſerue the Rule of a <hi>bonehome</hi> all the dayes of his life, and not come ouer into England, and lay hys laſie limmes to any honeſt laboure, whereby he may eate his own breade, and helpe to féede the féeble bodies of his decayed Father and Mother, or doo any honeſt ſeruice in the Common weale of hys Countrey.

But your mother hath taught you to vowe a wiueles lyfe, net knowing whether God wyll make you able to performe that vowe or not. So that although you ſhall burne in concupiſcence neuer ſo much, yet mary you may not, to

kéepe your body vndefiled, for you haue forſworne that remedye, which is the onely remedie that God hath appointed. Our mother hath tolde vs, that our father hath forbidde vs to ſteale, or to take anie thing that doth not by ſome iuſt title belong to vs, eyther by force or by fraude: But your mother teacheth you to robbe God of his glory, yea, and to challenge and clayme to your ſelf, that which belongeth onely to him, as the appoynting of a mediator, and the meanes of mediation, for the obtayning of pardon, and forgiuenes of ſinnes: which you aſſigne to Angels and ſaints, and to maſſyng Prieſtes, and to your ſelues, and to al other merite mongers.

               <p>Our mother hath tolde vs, that our father hath forbidden vs to beare falſe witnes againſt any man: But your mother teacheth you to belye all ſuch as ſhe calleth Proteſtants, and to ſay of all ſuch, (as you haue in theſe your Letters written) that they are the deuills miniſters, and that their life is ſuch, that if it were knowne to the ſimple Chriſtians, they would not onely wonder at their wilines, but alſo forſake theyr folly. Whereas that which you call theyr folly, is heauenly wiſedome, and that which you call wilines in them, is ſimple and true dealing.</p>
               <p>Our mother hath tolde vs, that our heauenly father woulde not that we ſhould luſt after any thing, that belongeth to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: But your mother hath taught you to luſt after the kingdom of England (which belongeth not to you that be fugitiues and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels) &amp; to haue your Order of Frauncis of <hi>Paula</hi> to be ſetled there.

A méete place for ſuch to preache in, as being Engliſh borne, haue Romiſh harts. We dare not rowle our ſelues vp and downe in the lappe of ſuch a mother. We will not forſake that mother, that hetherto hath taught vs, and doth ſtill teache vs, to feare, honour, and loue our heauenlie Father, and to frame our liues according to his will. In her lap we wyll rowle our ſelues vp and downe, as hetherto wee haue doone, and craue at Gods hands that we may doo ſo ſtyll, and encreaſe in loue toward our heauenly father, and towardes her. Her wordes we doo beléeue, and her words we doo hope we ſhal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue, ſo long as we ſhall liue here: for they are the words of truth, and words that teache nothing but the will of our heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is the God of truth.</p>
               <p>The Sermons which you call hereticall: your father &amp; mother neither may nor will leaue. For they are the plentifull pappes of that louing mother, in whoſe lap they doo rowle themſelues. And out of thoſe pappes they and all others that doo rowle themſelues, together with them, in that mothers lap, doo ſucke that milke that S. <hi>Peter</hi> writeth of. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. which nouriſheth to ſaluation. They will not therefore leaue thoſe dugges, but will hange ſtill vppon them. Your mother of Rome hath not ſo ſwéete, ſo pleaſant, nor ſo healthſome milke in her withered dugges. Her milke is poyſon to the children of God: wherefore our mothers children will none of it, neither will they leaue of going to thoſe Sermons, where they may ſucke ſo much good and healthfull Milke as may ſuffice them.</p>
               <p>You aduiſe your mother not to riſe ſo earelie in the morning, as ſhe hath béene accuſtomed to doo, to damne herſelfe body and ſoule.

So that, to riſe in the morning to heare the Goſpell of Chriſt preached, is in the iudgment of men of your ſort, to damne both bodie and ſoule. But if your mothers dwelling were in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> as it is in London, and ſhee woulde riſe at midnight, and goe to <hi>Nigeon,</hi> to heare Frier John and his fellowes ſinging theyr mattins before their bleſſed ſacrament of the Altar: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe ſhould be accounted the holyeſt Matrone in all <hi>Paris.</hi> Yea her ghoſtlye Father would aſſure her, that the place which the bleſſed Virgine

               <p>But doo ye not ſée (Sir Frier John) howe this parte of your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, rebowndeth vpon your ſelfe. Riſe not at midnight to damne your ſelfe bodie and ſoule.

Take no ſuch daily paynes as you doo, in ſinging your high maſſes, which can not profite you, but ſhall condemne you to hell fire (if you repent not) for all that you doo therein is Idolatrie, and falſe worſhippyng of God. Yea, it is the ſetting vp of an Idole in the place of God, and the giuing of Gods honour to an Idole.

               <p>Your mother, and all we Proteſtants, are and wilbe ready to doo as ſaint <hi>Iames</hi> teacheth in his 5. Epiſtle, where he ſayth thus: Confeſſe your ſinnes one to another.

We ſatiſfie &amp; make a mendes one to another, if our habilitie will ſtretch ſo far: if not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we know that God wyll require no more of vs, then hee will make vs able to doo. And as touching faults that are committed againſt vs, wée forgiue them, as Chriſt hath commaunded and taught vs. Yea, though our brother ſhall treſpaſſe againſt vs ſeauen times in a daie, and ſhall ſaie ſeauen times in a day, it repenteth me: we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue, becauſe we knowe that otherwiſe our heauenly father wyll not forgiue vs. And when the horrour of our ſinne, is ſo great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, that we can not otherwiſe be ſatiſfied, and aſſured of forgiuenes at Gods hande, but by ſuch comfort, as ſome that wee thinke to be of more knowledge, and of better life then we knowe our ſelues to be of, can miniſter vnto vs: then we make choyſe of ſome ſuch one as can certifie vs indéede, by the mercifull promiſes of God contained in the holie Scriptures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> made to peniſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſinners, and not by popiſh penaunce enioyned, and popiſh abſolution pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, by vertue of anie power giuen by that moſt holy Father of yours, the Romiſh Antichriſt.

But be it that you did: yet without peraduenture, you were neuer able to defende them halfe ſo well, as they bothe could and can. For if you had béene of ſuch habilitie to defend our Religion, as your Father and mother were then, and be now alſo, vndoubtedly, you coulde neuer haue béene ſo ſoone vanquiſhed as you were, by ſo weake aduerſaries, as by all likelihoode you had. But it ſéemeth that you had no outward aduerſary at all, but the ſpirit of Arrogancie onely that lurked within you, and mooued you to preſume vpon your ſelfe, and to take vppon you to iudge of the doctrine of others, before you had any knowledge of doctrine your ſelfe. But we muſt beleeue you (if wee luſt) when you ſay that you did knowe theyr opinions, &amp; did ſée that they were moſte falſe, and abhominable, and contrary to all holeſome doctrine, and to the Scripture it ſelfe: and by reaſon of thys, you were conſtrained to leaue them, and to make your ſelfe a Papiſt. A meruailous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (more to be muſed at then to be beléeued) that ſo young a man as Samuell Debnam was, in <hi>Anno.</hi> 1583. (at which time he was not Fryer John Frauncis) ſhoulde haue in that little corps of his, all holeſome learning, and ſuch a knowledge of Scriptures, that he was able to affyrme for truth, that the opinions that <hi>Caluine</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> helde, are contrary both to all holeſome doctrine, and to the Scripture it ſelfe. And yet I dare affyrme for trueth, that this profounde Clarke, did neuer (before that time, wherein hee ſayth he was enforced to make himſelfe a Papyſt) reade any one worke thorowe, that either <hi>Caluine</hi> or <hi>Luther</hi> haue written. Yea, and as I thinke, I may be bolde to affyrme, that this proſounde Diuine, had at that time, as little knowledge of that doctrine which he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth ſounde: as any young Grammarian, eyther hath or can haue of the déepeſt miſteries of Diuinitie. For I knowe, that before that time he neuer gaue himſelfe to any graue ſtudy. neyther dyd he gyue himſelfe to any manner of orderly reading. But his whole time (in manner) was ſpent in toying and tryfling, and for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt parte in idlenes, and vayne playing. And in the Scriptures, hee
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:9611:59"/>
coulde haue none other knowledge, then ſuch as he might attayne vnto, either by hearing in the Churches (where he neuer vſed to hearken attentiuely) or els by reading in my houſe, at the times of myne ordinary dinners and ſuppers, vnto which exerciſe I did em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ploye him, as I did other young boyes, that I kept in my houſe, as I kept him. And yet ſée howe he taketh vppon him, to condemne for moſt falſe, damnable, and contrary to all holeſome doctrine, yea and to the Scripture it ſelfe, the opinions that thoſe two excellent men (<hi>John Caluine</hi> and <hi>Martine Luther</hi>) helde and taught, and haue left behinde them in wryting to the viewe of all poſteritye. Arroganting to himſelfe, the full and perfect knowledge, as well of the Scriptures, as of all humane Doctrines, both good and bad. Yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (by thoſe ſpéeches that he vſeth) he would ſeeme to haue read and wayed, both the one and the other, and to haue conferred the one with the other, as one very deſirous to haue founde them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, the one to the other. But the falſhode of that which hee then fauoured, was ſo great and damnable, and the contrariety to all holeſome doctrine, and to the Scripture it ſelf, ſo manifeſt: that although <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yea, by the wordes that he addeth, he ſeemeth to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that except he had doone ſo, he muſt of neceſſity, haue pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed euerlaſtingly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For thus he ſayth.</p>

Would not a man (that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth theſe wordes) thinke that thys young Fryer, hath as much knowledge as is poſſible for a man to haue? And yet when he is opened, and thorowly ſearched, there is not one crumme of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge founde in him. Undoubtedly, it was but a viſion in ſléepe, that deceiued him. He dreamed that he knewe the opinions, that he wryteth of: and that he compared them with all holeſome doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and with the Scripture, and founde them, as he reporteth. But when he ſhall awake out of hys dreame (for as yet, hee lyeth ſno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

that he had more bagges of Golde then he was able to beare.

               <p>Thys is a poynt of déepe Diuinity, and of as cunning Sophiſtry. Fryer Iohns Mother did once ſay ſo, therefore of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity it muſt needes be ſo. But it may be, that Fryers of your Order haue a Priuiledge, whereby they may frame arguments, that ſhall conclude neither in Mode nor in Figure: and yet no man may denie, either the argument or any part thereof. I haue hearde it reported, that once there was a Pope, that would ſéeme to be a better Latiniſt then he was indéede, and therfore he would nowe and then be talking a little Latine, though hee did often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reache <hi>Priſcian</hi> a blowe. But on a time, there was one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that hearing him make default in not obſeruing the Rules of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:9611:60"/>
Grammer in his ſpéeche: thought good wyth due reuerence to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh him, ſaying: It may pleaſe your holines to pardon my boldnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As I take it, your holines hath broken <hi>Priſcians</hi> heade. The Pope anſwered, and ſayd: As I haue ſpoken ſo ſhall it bée, in deſpight of <hi>Priſcian,</hi> and all the Grammarians in the worlde. Nowe, if that holy Father, or any other amongſt your holy fathers of <hi>Rome,</hi> haue graunted you as large a liberty in framing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as that holy Father himſelfe vſed in ſpeaking Latine, then you may maintayne your argument for good amongſt Papiſtes, but amongſt Proteſtants it wyll neuer be allowed for good. The meaning of your mothers wordes, is as much as if ſhee ſhould ſay thus. The people were more addicted to Religion, in the olde time then they be nowe, but the Religion that then was in vre, is a corrupted and vnpure Religion, and the Religion that now is in vſe is more ſincere and pure. The people therefore are more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to embrace a corrupted Religion, then that which is more pure. Thys argument hath ſome ſence in it. And this ſaying is according to that ſaying of our Sauiour Chriſt. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. Lyght is come into the worlde, and men haue loued darknes more then light. Nowe, if you ſhoulde enforce theſe words againſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and others that were the Schollers of Chriſt, you ſhoulde doo them great wrong, for they were not of that ſorte of men, that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued darknes more then light, for they were choſen out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, and had theyr myndes renued, and as they were renued, they lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued light and hated darknes, that is, ignoraunce and wickednes of lyfe, which is the fruite of ignoraunce and darknes. Euen ſo, you doo open wrong to the Proteſtants, in that you enforce your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſpéeche agaynſt them, concluding that of neceſſity they muſt confeſſe, that eyther they be gouerned by the deuill: or els that the deuill is better able to worke deuotion in men, the God himſelfe is. Thys concluſion followeth not vpon the Premiſſes. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though men generally, haue not ſo great deuotion to the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that is nowe in vſe, as generally they had to that Religion, that was in vſe in the time of ignoraunce: yet ſuch as be now vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayned Chriſtians, euen ſuch as men of your ſorte doo vſe to call Proteſtants, haue nowe as greate deuotion to the right Religion, as euer the Papyſts had to theyr vayne ſuperſtition, or as you (Maſter Fryer John) haue nowe to that ſolery y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you haue nowe

We know that our God is in heauen, and that he can doo what hee wyll doo, and hath doone what he woulde doo, both in heauen, in earth, and in hell, and in all deepe places.

For ſhe may ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vſe the Bible in Engliſh, nor heare the Proteſtants preache, neither doo you direct her which way ſhe may take, to come where ſhe may heare Catholick preachers. Your meaning therfore muſt néedes be, to bring her into the darke dungion of ignoraunce, which men<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your ſort doo vſe to call the mother of deuotion &amp; obedience.

               <p>Fyrſt you ſay one <hi>Pater noſter.</hi> Then, the <hi>Aue Maria</hi> tenne times, and then one <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> and agayne, the <hi>Aue Maria</hi> ten times: and ſo forth, tyll you haue rehearſed the <hi>Pater noster</hi> fiue times, and the <hi>Aue Maria</hi> fyftie times. And then you rehearſe <hi>Credo in Deum Patrem,</hi> once. And this is the order of your praying vpon Beades. And when you haue gone ouer your Beades three times, in this order: then you haue ſayd our Ladies Pſalter (as you doo terme it) I meruaile y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you did not aduiſe your Mother to forget the Lords Prayer and the Creede, that ſhe hath learned in the Engliſhe tongue, and learne the <hi>Pater noster,</hi> the <hi>Aue Maria,</hi> and the <hi>Credo in Deum,</hi> in the Latine tongue. For our Engliſhe Prayers can not agrée with your Italian Beades. Neither is it poſſible, for that perſon to be deuout, in that kind of deuotion, that is not ſo ignoraunt, that he vnderſtandeth not one word of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that he vſeth. I meruayle therefore, that you which doo vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Latine tongue, can be ſo blinded, that you can allowe of that manner of praying. I feare me, that you haue ſo prouoked God to wrathe, by your wylfull Apoſtacie, that in iuſtice he hath ſo blinded your vnderſtanding, that you take darknes for light, and ignoraunce for knowledge: the deuill for God, and GOD for the deuill. And then is your caſe moſt miſerable, as ſayth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eſay. <hi>V ae qui dicitis bonum malum &amp; malum bonum. &amp;c.</hi> Eſay.</hi> 5. Woe is vnto you, or alas for you, that doo ſay that good is euil, and

that euyll is good. If thys be your caſe, I doo not hope, that thys which I nowe doo, or that can be doone by any other, can helpe any thing at all to drawe you out of your darke dungion of ignorance. But hoping better of you, and that though my laboure coulde not profite you, yet ſome other may bee profited thereby. I haue thought good to make thys matter as plaine as I can, that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt truth, may (if it be poſſible) preuayle with you, and bring you backe agayne to your former happy eſtate, wherein you were once, and ſéemed to be ſetled therein. If that can not bee, yet I hope this labour of mine may be a meane to ſtay ſome ſuch as you were from running headlong after you into that pytte of deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that you are fallen into.</p>
               <p>You teache your mother to craue helpe at the handes of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed virgin, that was neuer able to helpe her ſelfe. Shee her ſelfe ſayth, That her ſpyrite reioyced in God her Sauiour: and woulde you that your mother ſhoulde nowe put that bleſſed virgin (whom God hath ſaued) in the place of that God that ſaued her, by cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that helpe at her handes, which can not be had at the handes of any, but of God himſelfe? Your mother had learned (before ſhée bare you) that it is God that draweth the Infants out of theyr mothers wombe, and that it is he that ſuſtaineth them whylſt they hang vpon their mothers dugges. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 22. And when ſhe trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of Chylde, ſhe called vpon him, and not vpon the bleſſed virgin. And whence came thys calling vppon the bleſſed Virgin in that caſe, but from the cuſtome of the Heathen women, which beeing perſwaded that the Moone hath a naturall dominion in moyſt mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters, called vppon her vnder the name of <hi>Iuno lucina.</hi> And when Chriſtians beganne to declyne from that perfection of Chriſtian knowledge that had beene taught by the Apoſtles, and theyr im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſucceſſors: Chriſtian women thought they ſhould not doo amiſſe, to put the bleſſed mother of our Sauiour Chriſt, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place of this <hi>Iuno,</hi> and ſo they fel to calling vpon her, in their peril in the trauayle of Childbyrth. And wyll you bring your mother backe agayne to this ſuperſtition?</p>
               <p>If you wyll giue any credite to ſaint Auguſtine, hee wyll fell you, that the bleſſed Virgin dooth neyther require nor allow of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſuch honour to be giuen vnto her. In his Booke intituled of true Religion, and in the laſt Chapter thereof, hee wryteth thus.

               <p>It beginneth very well, for thus ſhe muſt ſay: O ſwéete Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. But in the next wordes, you teache her to flée from Ieſus, and to be at defiaunce with him. For ſhe muſt ſay thus: I doo ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beléeue all that my ſonne Samuell beléeueth. Which is as much as if ſhe ſhoulde ſay thus. Farwell ſwéete Ieſus: I wil no longer depende vpon thée. For my ſwéete ſonne Samuell, hath commaunded me to depende vppon hym. I may no longer beléeue as thou haſt taught me: but I muſt, and wyll beléeue all that my ſonne Samuell beléeueth. Thou haſte taught me to beléeue, that whoſoeuer beléeueth and is baptiſed, ſhalbe ſaued. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. But my ſonne Samuell ſaith, that except I confeſſe my ſinnes to a Prieſt, and be by him abſolued, and reconciled to the Romyſh Catholicke Churche, I ſhall bee damned both body and ſoule, and I am ſure hée woulde not ſay it, except hee dyd beléeue it. O ſwéete Ieſus, thou haſte called mee, and haſte ſayde vnto mée amongſt other, Come vnto mée all yee that laboure, and be heauy laden, and I wyll refreſhe you.

al white meates, he riſeth euery night at midnight, he doth ſcourge himſelfe naked often times: yea, he gyueth himſelfe 400. ſtrypes at one time. Yea, fearing to fall into the handes of the liuing God (which is horrible) hée hath for ſaken the world (as he ſayth) and the life of a Scholler, and hath made himſelfe a <hi>Minime</hi> Fryer, chooſing rather that way to fall into the hands of GOD, then (li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing as his Father and I doo) to fall into the pawes of the deuill.

               <p>O ſwéete Ieſus, beare with me, I muſt beléeue all this, for my ſonne Samuell dooth beléeue it, and hath wylled mee to ſay euery day, that I doo beléeue all that hee dooth beléeue. O ſwéete Ieſus thou haſt ſayde, Let ſuch as hath eares to heare, hearken. <hi>Math.</hi> 13. And thy holy Apoſtle Iames hath ſayde: Be ſwyft to heare. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.

But my ſonne Samuell forbyddeth mée the vſe of the Byble in Engliſh. And hée knoweth that I vnderſtande none other language. Hys meaning therefore muſt needes bée, to forbydde that which thou hath commaunded. O ſwéete Ieſus, ſuffer mée not to be ſeduced by my ſonne Samuels flattering and hypocriticall ſpéeches.

And worke thou in my hart by thy holye ſpyrite, that I may haue a ready good will, dayly to vſe it. But alas, he beléeueth that thy bleſſed Mother Mary, is able to helpe ſuch as call vppon her, and therefore, hée teacheth me to pray vnto her to helpe mée: But thou haſt taught me a leſſon contrary to that. When you pray, you ſhall ſay: <hi>O our Father which art in heauen, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy wyll be doone in earth, as it is in heauen. &amp;c.</hi>

Let mee not ſo hearken to my Sonne Samuell, as that following hys counſell, I ſhoulde doo contrary to thy commaundements.

She wyll none of it therefore.

               <p>And (Fryer Iohn) I muſt aduiſe you to call to remembraunce that dealing of yours, when you preſumed to bée partaker of the Sacrament of the body and bloude of Chriſte, in company wyth your mother, the morrowe after you hadde béene at ſhryfte, and were (as your ſelfe haue in theſe your Letters confeſſed) reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Romiſh Catholicke Church. If Chriſte did then dwell in you: vndoubtedly, bothe Chriſt and Antichriſt may dwell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is knowne to bée a thing impoſſible. You were recon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciled to Antichriſt, therefore hée dwelt in you, and not Chriſt. You preſumed with <hi>Iudas,</hi> to eate the Lordes breade, againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, as <hi>Iudas</hi> did, when he had before bounde himſelfe by promiſe (for money) to deliuer the Lorde into the handes of the high Prieſtes and Elders of the people.</p>
               <p>Euen ſo had you compacted with your new fréendes, and made promiſe to forſake the Proteſtants Religion (as you terme it) and to embrace the Romiſh Catholicke Religion, during the whole time of your tranſitory life. And howe durſt you then thruſt your ſelfe into our Communion the next day after you hadde made thys promiſe to your ghoſtly father, that had béene the meane and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of your reconciliation: and ſo diſſemble both wyth your newe and your olde fréendes, as a Newter, or Iacke on both ſides?

But that diſpenſation can not helpe you: for it was <hi>Panis Domini,</hi> the Lords breade, as well to you, as that other was to <hi>Iudas.</hi> And you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it <hi>Contra Dominum.</hi> againſt the Lord, as Iudas did, euen to your owne condemnation, becauſe you made no difference of the Lordes body.

It is true as you ſay, that whoſoeuer will come after Chriſt, muſt take vppe theyr Croſſe and followe him. It is true alſo, that the paſſyons and tribulations of thys worlde, are not woorthye of that glory which GOD wyll giue vnto vs. But ſir, if your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould hearken to you, and by going to ſhrift and hearing of

               <p>If you may haue your wiſhed hope, I doubt not but you wyll put both your Father and mother, and all others that haue béene your foſterers, to their tryall: for yeeare become an hungry whelpe of that bloudie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Butchers curre, that ruleth in <hi>Rome,</hi> and thyrſteth after the bloude of the Engliſh Nation.

               <p>But ſir, what meane you by thys, that you ſay that God wyll gyue vs that glorie, whereof the paſſions and tribulations that wée ſuffer héere are not worthy.

It were well, if you had a care for your owne ſoules health, which you can not haue, ſo long as you haue no care to doo any duety, either to your naturall Parents, or to your natiue Country, or to any others, to whom you doo owe duety, both by the Lawe of GOD and of nature.</p>

You may not doo that which GOD commaundeth to bée doone, except the ſame be commaunded by your holy Father the Pope, the Pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, and your Subpriors. If the Popes holines, your father Pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, and your Subpriors commande any thing: that you may, and muſt doo, and you may not mooue any queſtion at all, whether God haue not commaunded the contrary. Yea though you know that GOD hath forbidden the dooing of it: yet you muſt néedes doo it, for you haue vowed obedience. &amp;c. You know that GOD hath forbidden the worſhypping of Images, and all vſe of Imagry in the exerciſe of Religion. <hi>Exo.</hi> 20. And yet you muſt néedes haue them and worſhip them, becauſe they to whome you haue vowed obedience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doo commaund it.
