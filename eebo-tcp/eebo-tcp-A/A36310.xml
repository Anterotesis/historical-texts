            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS after sickness, health; after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, liberty; after sorrows, solace; after pain, pleasure; after showres, sunshine; after wars, peace; and after melancholly, mirth is the more musical, sweet, acceptable, delightful, and pleasant to the full
<pb facs="tcp:42803:3"/>
possessour and free enjoyer thereof; so in regard of the many and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold pressures, oppressions, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings, exilements, imprisonments, and inutterable injuries and wrongs many millions have for these many years of late undoubtedly endured, if they were right Royalists; and wherein your Right Worshipfull Father Sir <hi>Thomas Edwards</hi> late de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased (I am confident) did not escape scotfree: I have presumed to present to your favourable Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, <hi>A Cabinet of merry Conceits,</hi> which I penn'd at some interims of leasure for mine own private recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation then, but for yours now; wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that you may be as pleasant in the perusing of them, as I was in the
<pb facs="tcp:42803:3"/>
composing of them. Wherein I have pretermitted divine matters, for, <hi>non ludendum cum sanctis;</hi> remembring that the Fly playing with the candle had his wings clipt for his over bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: nor have I intermeddled with State Affairs, for, <hi>quae supra nos, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil ad nos;</hi> not forgetting <hi>Aesops</hi> Wolf, who prying into the Lions den, had his skin pull'd o're his ears for his presumption. Nor have I pointed at any particular persons by (Critick-like) traducing his good name; or (Cinick-like) carping at his carriage and conditions; for I never lik'd of such an one as <hi>Horace</hi> hints at,
<q>
                  <l>—duminodo risum</l>
                  <l>Excuciat sibi non hic cuiquam parcit amico.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:42803:4"/>
So he may shake with laughter where he goes,</l>
                  <l>He does not spare the dearest friend he knows.</l>
               </q>
Since this late, though long desir'd thrice happy Alteration, far beyond the expectation of humane wit, (for therein was <hi>digitus Dei,</hi> the visible power of the invisible Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence perspicuously manifested to all the world) very many, and those great ones too, who though they had the cream of the former times, have clean turn'd Cat in pan, and would have all, (if it might be) they finde such sweetness in it. Indeed it was long since a remarkable Machiavili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Maxime, that <hi>qui nescit dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare, nescit vivere,</hi> (i. e.) who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb facs="tcp:42803:4"/>
dissemble cannot live; which though it were a Heathenish speech, yet was never put more in practice then in these Phanatick times; for he that cannot metamorphose his shape like <hi>Proteus,</hi> vary his hiew like the <hi>Polypus,</hi> change his colour like the <hi>Cameleon,</hi> bear two faces under a hood like <hi>Janus,</hi> comply with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Planet like <hi>Mercury,</hi> vary and change like the Moon constantly, turn with the Weathercock, adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with <hi>Aristippus,</hi> equivocate with <hi>Synon,</hi> dissemble with <hi>Gnatho,</hi> hunt with the Hound, and hold with the Hare, carry fire in the one hand, and water in the other; and in a word, who cannot temporize at all times, with all persons, and in all
<pb facs="tcp:42803:5"/>
places, that man knows not how to look or live in this hypocritical, perverse, and crooked Generation. I remember a Jeast, as I heard fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd upon Dr. <hi>Pearn</hi> a Cantabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian, in the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. in whose Reign there was much chopping and changing in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and still this Dr. temporiz'd and turn'd with them at a hairs breadth; who being a notable bone Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and invited to a great Feast, after dinner was ended, he very pleasantly cull'd out a Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man there to dance with him, whom after a little tracing he high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applauded for her exquisite dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing; (as indeed she merited no less) she thanking him for her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deserved
<pb facs="tcp:42803:5"/>
commendations, retorts this jear upon him; Truly Mr. Dr. I must ingeniously confess I can dance indifferent well, but I cannot turn so well as you: whereat the whole company then present laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very heartily. Another Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in an eminent Office at Court in the same K. <hi>Henry's</hi> Reign, kept ever a correspondency with the times, let them turn how they would he weigh'd not, when as others that had a more tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science were displac'd and lost all; which some well observing, ask'd him how he could hold in such diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult times as those were: Pish, (quoth he) ye are all fools, <hi>ego ex sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice fio, non ex quercu;</hi> I am made of
<pb facs="tcp:42803:6"/>
the tractable and pliable Willow, and not of the inflexible and stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Oak. Wherein the loyal Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allists rightly resembles the Oak; for as the well-rooted Oak will not be easily overturn'd by any violent storm, or furious tempest whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; so the well gounded Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list will not be moved, much less be carried away with every whisling winde of any vain, erroneous, and false doctrine, but like <hi>Aristotles Quadratus, in utrumque paratus,</hi> come weal or woe, prosperity or povery, he continues still the same. The Oak was formerly by the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens dedicated to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and so termed <hi>Jovis arbor;</hi> but we may now more properly call it, not <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:42803:6"/>
but <hi>Jehovae arbor,</hi> not <hi>Joves,</hi> but <hi>Jehovahs</hi> tree; for the <hi>Royall Oake,</hi> by the special Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence proved a most happy <hi>Asylum,</hi> and sure succour and refuge to his most Sacred Majesty, when his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent integrity was most eagerly pursued after by those raging and ravening, blood-seeking and blood-sucking Wolves, (palliated in fair and specious sheeps cloathing) to be utterly devoured by them. Now right Worshipful, in that I well know, that I shall have some mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Momus,</hi> carping <hi>Zoilus,</hi> and snarling <hi>Cynick</hi> (whereof no age is free) censoriously to traduce, and despitefully to writhe and wrest the sense and meaning os some of these

my harmless Lines; I tender these my pleasing pains to your Worship as my <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> to secure and shrewd them under the tutelary Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of your Worships protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as under <hi>Achilles</hi> seven-fold Buckler, from the inevitable darts of calumniating tongues.

                  <l>With weary toilsome labour spent out-right,</l>
                  <l>Creeps in a Cock of Hay quite over head,</l>
                  <l>And there fell fast asleep as in a bed.</l>
                  <l>Two knaves who us'd to steal Hay thither came,</l>
                  <l>The master and his man (whom I could name)</l>
                  <l>Went fair and softly to some Cocks of Hay,</l>
                  <l>The man takes that wherein the Barge-man lay;</l>
                  <l>And for to binde it hard he was not slack,</l>
                  <l>But lifting of't it almost broke his back.</l>
                  <l>Quoth he, and swore, It weighs the Dev'l and all,</l>
                  <l>I am scarce able with it for to crawl:</l>
                  <l>So much the better (fool) his master sayes;</l>
                  <l>For it has in't the more, the more it weighs.</l>
                  <l>At last to a Rail hard by, he him betakes,</l>
                  <l>And rests him on't, at which the Bargeman wakes.</l>
                  <l>Oh! quoth the Bargeman: th' other never stayes,</l>
                  <l>But (frighted) throws down all, and runs his wayes.</l>

                  <l>At thirty smell it, but thereat not stay;</l>
                  <l>At forty, taste a sip, and so away.</l>
                  <l>At fifty, drink it, but excess refrain:</l>
                  <l>But when you are sixty, pour it down amain;</l>
                  <l>For jovial Sack with heat doth Youth inrage,</l>

                  <l>Which had two buckets that went up and down;</l>
                  <l>The Fox expecting somewhat there to finde,</l>
                  <l>Leapt in the one, which soon him down did winde:</l>

But finding nought, was there with grief confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</l>
                  <l>Being hungry, cold, and wet, and well nigh drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</l>
                  <l>The Wolf more eager then the Fox of prey,</l>
                  <l>Hies hot-foot after him without delay;</l>
                  <l>And coming to the Well, casts down his eyes,</l>
                  <l>Where the Fox fishing for some frogs he spies;</l>
                  <l>Reynold, what dost thou there. (Quoth he) offish,</l>
                  <l>I've here great store, as good as heart can wish.</l>
                  <l>Say'st so, sweet Cuss; but how shall I get thither,</l>
                  <l>Leap in that bucket, and thou'lt soon come hither.</l>
                  <l>Se leaps into't, the wheel turns round amain,</l>
                  <l>Which brings him down, and Reynold up again.</l>
                  <l>As soon as he was there he did begin</l>
                  <l>To tread for Eels, but could not finde a fin.</l>
                  <l>Ah! I see Reynold, I am now betray'd,</l>
                  <l>There's no truth in the words that thou hast said.</l>

                  <l>But now for all, with me they'l take a course.</l>
                  <l>All these do wound and gall my guilty soul,</l>
                  <l>Which I alas, do here too late condole:</l>

                  <l>Most cruelly, if that they do not hang me.</l>

Then reach't here (said the Gentleman) and see</l>
                  <l>If I not carve't up artificially;</l>
                  <l>Quoth Scholar, Sir, you've don't (indeed) so neatly,</l>
                  <l>So rarely, exquisitely, and compleatly;</l>
                  <l>That sure hereafter, wheresoev'r I do</l>

                  <l>She whom he there calls <hi>Heifer</hi> was his wife,</l>

                  <l>

                  <l>I care not <hi>Merrimouth</hi> for all thy talk,</l>
                  <l>I shall light on thee, if abroad thou walk.</l>
                  <l>Well, well, <hi>Gun,</hi> for thy threats a course I'le take,</l>
                  <l>Though <hi>Gun</hi> thou now but a false fire dost make.</l>

                  <l>Whilst she thus scold a Constable past by,</l>

Come Constable bring with you along <hi>Gun,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And I will make him smoke for what he's done.</l>
                  <l>Who being before a Justice brought, he told,</l>
                  <l>That <hi>Merrimouth</hi> was such an arrant scold,</l>
                  <l>None could live by her; for she us'd to prattle</l>
                  <l>Louder then many Guns in a set battle.</l>
                  <l>But she after a curtsie dropr, or twain,</l>
                  <l>Did fall a fresh of charging <hi>Gun</hi> again.</l>
                  <l>Sir, <hi>Gun</hi> did kill my Duck, that so oft laid,</l>
                  <l>Murther'd my Mallard, that so oft did tread.</l>
                  <l>This <hi>Gun</hi> has oft been stock'd, and then has burst,</l>
                  <l>And hurt a many who him heav'ly curst.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Gun,</hi> thou shalt have no rest I tell thee troth,</l>
                  <l>Till thou hast giv'n me good content for both;</l>
                  <l>If thou think'ft I'le put up such wrongs as this,</l>
                  <l>I tell thee <hi>Gun</hi> thou tak'st thy aim amiss:</l>
                  <l>And if thou think'st me in my words to catch,</l>
                  <l>Thou'rt out, for <hi>Gun</hi> has met now with thy match.</l>
                  <l>Quoth Justice, Huswife best you hold your tongue,</l>
                  <l>And you <hi>Gun</hi> must content her for the wrong.</l>
                  <l>Content a <hi>Nunquam satis,</hi> sure there's no man,</l>

                  <l>
                     <hi>Gun,</hi> you o're-shot your self in a strange sort,</l>
                  <l>Henceforth <hi>Gun</hi> give of her a good report.</l>
                  <l>Your carriage <hi>Gun,</hi> is bad in all mens sight,</l>
                  <l>For you do miss the mark you aim at quite.</l>
                  <l>Know you before whom now you are? why then,</l>
                  <l>Shew more respect, we're not as other men.</l>

We're higher by the head, you cannot tell us,</l>

                  <l>
                     <hi>Gun,</hi> you must give'r content, for you did wrong her,</l>

                  <l>And for the future, <hi>Gun,</hi> I tell you plain,</l>
                  <l>You nev'r must carry Peece abroad again.</l>

                  <hi>152.</hi> Of certain ingenious Arts, and rare Inventions of former Ages.</head>
               <lg>
                  <l>A touch of some ingenious Acts I'le give,</l>
                  <l>Of some rare Artists that you'l scarce believe.</l>
                  <l>One curiously contriv'd (as stories tell)</l>
                  <l>All <hi>Homers Iliads</hi> in a small Nut shell.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Mermicedes</hi> compos'd a Coach so small,</l>
                  <l>A Fly could cover Horses, Coach and all.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Callicrates</hi> did frame an Ant by art,</l>
                  <l>So small, one could discern thereof no part</l>
                  <l>Without help of a Multiplying Glass,</l>
                  <l>Which shew'd each lineament, and what it was.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>One <hi>Archimedes</hi> fram'd most cunningly,</l>
                  <l>A Dove by art, which o're the Seas did fly;</l>
                  <l>He made a Myrrhor too, was much admir'd,</l>
                  <l>Wherewith Ships a great distance off he fir'd.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>One <hi>Paphos</hi> a great store of Birds had caught,</l>
                  <l>And long time closely in a Cage had taught</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:42803:57"/>
For to speak plain, when they were let abroad,</l>
                  <l>Paphos est Deus, Paphos <hi>is a God.</hi>
                  </l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>One taught a Crow to salute <hi>Caesar</hi> plain</l>
                  <l>In Greek, whom <hi>Caesar</hi> pleas'd well for his pain.</l>
                  <l>A Cobler who the Crow in Greek heard chat in,</l>
                  <l>And's owner so well paid, taught one in Latine:</l>
                  <l>At length with <hi>Salve Caesar</hi> to salute;</l>
                  <l>But finding the Crow very dull unto't,</l>
                  <l>As in despair would often to it cry,</l>
                  <l>Oleum, &amp; operam heu perdidi;</l>
                  <l>Which is, I've lost my labour, and my pain:</l>
                  <l>Which the Bird hearing o're and o're again,</l>
                  <l>At last learnt both: The Cobler who heard talk</l>
                  <l>That <hi>Caesar</hi> forthwith was that way to walk,</l>
                  <l>Held out the Crow as <hi>Caesar</hi> past that way,</l>
                  <l>And <hi>salve Caesar</hi> straight the Crow did say:</l>
                  <l>Which <hi>Caesar</hi> noting, said it did but chat,</l>
                  <l>And that he'd better Birds at home then that;</l>
                  <l>Whereat the Crow again did plainly cry,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Oleum &amp; operam heu perdidi:</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Caesar</hi> his speech that fell so pat regarded,</l>
                  <l>And so the Cobler too he well rewarded.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Aristus</hi> being invited as a Guest</l>
                  <l>With others to a solemn sumptuous Feast,</l>
                  <l>Did cause an artificial Bird to fly</l>
                  <l>To each one then at board respectively;</l>
                  <l>And when from one to one it so had past,</l>
                  <l>It came to his own hand again at last.</l>

                  <l>Another made an Eagle for to soar</l>

                  <l>Which afterwards with his Imperial train</l>
                  <l>Attending on the Coach fled back again.</l>

                  <l>The Watch-maker as curious skill imparts</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>One made a Golden Chain with lock and key,</l>
                  <l>And four and twenty links drawn by a flea;</l>
                  <l>The which a Countess in a box kept warm,</l>
                  <l>And fed it daily on her milk-white arm.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>One <hi>Giges</hi> did compose a curious Ring,</l>
                  <l>Through which he (himself unseen) saw ev'ry thing.</l>
               </lg>

                  <l>The Invention first of Guns (as stories tell)</l>
                  <l>From <hi>Almain</hi> came, I rather think from Hell;</l>
                  <l>For there's a filthy smoak, and a foul smother,</l>
                  <l>And spittitg flames of fire at one another;</l>
                  <l>And men with Guns, incens'd with rage and ire,</l>
                  <l>Like Dev'ls at one another spit forth fire:</l>
                  <l>So that 'tis very like at first it came</l>
                  <l>From Hell, or from the Devil or his Dam.</l>

               <l>And as the Jews all swines flesh held impure,</l>

               <l>And to reign over them would not abide him,</l>
               <l>But (guiltless) with great fury crucified him;</l>
               <l>Ev'n so the Scots our good first <hi>Charlemain,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Their native King would not permit to reign;</l>
               <l>But <hi>Judas-like,</hi> when they had him in hold,</l>
               <l>(And might have sav'd) deliver'd up for Gold:</l>
               <l>Nay worse then <hi>Judas,</hi> they would nev'r restore,</l>
               <l>The perditorious hire they had before;</l>
               <l>Nor do repent that execrable deed,</l>
               <l>A stigmatized shame to all their seed:</l>
               <l>No, they'l be hang'd first, yet for cursed pelf</l>
               <l>They'l hang themselves, as <hi>Judas</hi> hang'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</l>

God bless our King from those perfidious Scots,</l>
