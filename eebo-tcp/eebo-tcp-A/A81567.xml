         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the firſt place I ſhall ſet
downe the definition of a
Dreame: A Dreame is that
which appeareth to us while
we are ſleeping; not by the
function of the eyes, but by imagination.
Some Dreames leave a man joyfull and well
diſpoſed at a thing: Contrariwiſe, there are
others ſad and offenſive, that for divers dayes
after ſuch dreames, procure a melancholy
languiſhing both in Soule and Body, making
a man unable to receive any delight.</p>
            <p>Many have preſaged by theſe dreames both
of good lucke and bad, which ſoone after
ſhould happen unto them. Some ignorant
people have not ſpared to ſay, that they are
the ſoules of deceaſed perſons, or Angels,
that doe advertiſe men of ſuch things as ſhall
enſue unto them. My purpoſe is not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
if the ſonles of the deceaſed have at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
time returned into the world, I leave that
to be decided by learned Divines; but will
diſcourſe of the cauſes naturall, both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb facs="tcp:156887:4"/>
pleaſing dreames, and ſuch as are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent
and offenſive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dioſcorides, Pliny,</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> ſay, that there
are divers kindes of meates which doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender
and cauſe ſorrowfull dreames, as
Beanes, Peaſe, Coleworts, Garlicke, Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Leekes, Cheſnuts, and all opening
roots, the fleſh of a Boare, or old Hare, and
Beefe, all water-fowles, as Duck, Gooſe, and
the like. All troubled wines; nor is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
doubt to be made, but that commonly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to ſuch meates as wee uſe in our fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
raiſing humours anſwerable to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
qualities, that dreames are begotten of
the ſame nature. All theſe meates before
mentioned, with many others, which I have
omitted, doe ingender evill humours, and are
cholericke, phlegmaticke, and melancholy.
It is neceſſary then, that the body that hath
been uſed to ſuch kindes of meates, ſhould
likewiſe bee of the temper of the ſaid hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
and that the manners and actions of
the ſoul, ſhould follow the temperature of the
body, <hi>Galen</hi> is of opinion, and hath written a
booke thereof expreſly. Likewiſe ſuch men
as have ſuſtained ſome great loſſe, either in
their honours, body, goods, parents, kindred
or friends, and oftentimes in their dreames
they have very ſtrange, fearfull and mournfull
<pb facs="tcp:156887:5"/>
apparitions: For many times it comes to paſſe,
that men dreame in the night time, ſeeming to
ſpeake, ſee, underſtand, negotiate in the
precedent dayes affairs, or elſe on ſome thing
whereto they beare much affection: But by
meates that are eaſily digeſted, cauſeth plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
dreames. Such as eate anniſeeds after
ſupper, or when they are going to bed, or
have fed with Saffron, or dranke with Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
or Balme, he will not onely have a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
ſpirit, but alſo will dreame very accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
things. There is a certaine Unguent
prepared by Apothecaries, which is called
<hi>Populeon,</hi> in regard of the juice of Poplar
leaves, if the temples be rubbed therewith,
and chafed with the liver, veines, the branches
of the great Arteries, and the ſoles of the
feet, it is not onely the provocation of ſound
ſleepe, but it cauſeth alſo delightfull and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetious
dreames. <hi>Cicedamus</hi> ſaith, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
made an oyntment compounded in this
manner: the fat of young infants taken out of
their graves, the ſingle of Perſley, of Aco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum,
of Pantaphilon, wherewith if ſome
women and weake perſons had chaſt their
braines, it is almoſt incredible to ſpeake what
and how many things they did perſwade
themſelves to ſee; one while matters of
delight, as Theaters, Gardens, Fiſh-ponds,
<pb facs="tcp:156887:5"/>
Ornaments, &amp; the like; ſo they imagined they
lay with him or her of whom they were moſt
deſirous. Otherwhiles they ſeemed to ſee
Kings and Magiſtrates with their guards and
attendants; yea, all the glory and pompe of
mankinde, with many other excellent things,
as wee ſee in paintings farre greater then ever
Nature made them. At other times they did
ſee heavy ſights, as Ravens, Scritchoules,
Priſons, Dens, and Torments.</p>
            <p>Having ſpoken concerning the qualities
of Dreames occaſioned, and proceeding
from ſuſtentation, and alſo ſome things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
applyed, I will now ſpeake of ſuch
as doe predeſtinate ſickneſſe and diſeaſes,
and that by naturall cauſes. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith,
that if a man doe dreame that he ſeeth f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e,
it noteth the Dreamer to bee abounding in
Choler, or of a Cholericke humour and
diſpoſition, whereby hee is very apt to fall
into hot and burning diſeaſes. Hee that drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
he ſeeth ſmoake or miſts, or profound
darkneſſe, is much diſpoſed to melancholy
ſickneſſes. To dreame of raine and moyſture
betokeneth the abounding with good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.
To dreame of ſtorme, haile, or ice,
ſignifieth the redundance of phlegme to
to be moſt cold, the conſtitution of the aire
hath ſuch power over humane bodies that it
<pb facs="tcp:156887:6"/>
impreſſeth both in the body and the ſoule
the preſent qualities and diſpoſitions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
<hi>Galen</hi> declares that a man dreamed that
his left thigh was transformed into a Marble
ſtone, and within a ſhort while after by a
dead Palſie hee loſt utterly the uſe of that
member. A Wraſtler dreamed that he was
in a veſſell full of bloud, and ſo deepe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that ſcarcely the top of his head could bee
ſeene. <hi>Galen</hi> gathered by this dreame that hee
had great neede of taking ſome bloud from
him, by meanes whereof he was cured of the
pluriſie. Others dreamed that they were
bathing themſelves in a Bath of hot water.
The Phyſitian prognoſticated upon this
dreame, that the Patient muſt be freed from
this diſeaſe by judicatory ſwimming which
thereon followed, and thereby he won great
reputation; whoſoever dreameth that he is
preſſed with a great burthen, there is no doubt
but his animall faculties are oppreſſed by a
great multitude of humours: contrariwiſe,
ſuch as dreame they flye in the aire, runne,
leape, and dance, denoteth a light body ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
from the ſuperaboundance of vitious
humours. Such as dreame that they are in
dunghills and ſuch like filthy places, they
muſt needes bee poſſeſſed of noyſome hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
but they to whom it appeares that
<pb facs="tcp:156887:6"/>
they are converſant in pleaſant, ſweete, and
delightfull places, good humours doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in them, and it is a ſigne of health.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe forenamed dreames, I will
not here inſert that there are none but ſuch
as are grounded upon naturall cauſes, but on
the grace of God, eſpecially hee giveth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to ſome men to expreſſe ſuch things for
the benefit &amp; good of others: as hapned to
<hi>Galen</hi> the Phyſitian, who had a man under
his care that had an artery in his ancle bone
halfe cut in ſunder, whereby hee loſt all his
bloud before any remedy could be applyed
to him: hee writeth that hee was advertiſed
in his ſleepe that hee ſhould cut the artery in
ſunder and the ends would retire to each ſide,
and ſo locke together againe, when hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked
hee executed what his dreame had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
to him, &amp; by that meanes hee cured
the man. We read likewiſe of an Angell that
appeared in the form of the goddeſſe <hi>Pallas</hi>
to <hi>Antonius</hi> (Phyſitian to <hi>Auguſtus</hi>) admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
him that though <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was ſicke,
yet hee ſhould not faile to bee preſent in the
battell, which was on the morrow to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſsius,</hi> and that he ſhould
there abide in his tent, which he would have
done, but that the Phyſitians perſwaded him
to the contrary, for it came to paſſe that the
<pb facs="tcp:156887:7"/>
enemies ſouldiers wonne the tents, where
queſtionleſſe they had ſlaine <hi>Auguſtus</hi> if hee
had beene preſent there; So by this dreame
he prevented his death, wonne the day, and
remained ſole Monarch of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire:
under his Reigne was borne the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of the World. <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> declares
in the life of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that when he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
his ſiege before the City of Tyre, hee
being entred for ſuccour of the Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,
who ſaid they were deſcended of the
Tyrians, concluded to raiſe his ſiege as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payring
ever to ſurprize it, but in a dreame a
Satyre appeared unto him, after whom hee
followed, as hee fled before him into his
Chamber. His Interpreters told him that this
was a certaine forewarning to continue his
ſiege for longer daies before the City, and
that hee ſhould ſurely take it, which fell out
to be true; and this long before had beene
foretold by a Prophet who ſaid that a Greek
ſhould governe in the Country.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures are full of Dreams where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
divers Princes have beene admoniſhed
both for their owne and peoples welfare, as
<hi>Abimelech</hi> King of Gerar, who was poſſeſſed
of <hi>Abrahams</hi> wife, ſuppoſing ſhe had been his
ſiſter, onely hee was fore-warned ſleeping,
that hee ſhould attempt nothing againſt her
<pb facs="tcp:156887:7"/>
modeſty, leſt he incurred the judgement of
God, and he obeyed. Another Egyptian
King by Dreames which <hi>Ioſeph</hi> interpreted
to him whileſt hee was in priſon, found ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe
the aſſiſtance of God to ſhun his
owne ruine, and the death of his people, by
a barrenneſſe in his Kingdome, which ſhould
continue for ſeven yeares; after as many years
of reſt: by reaſon whereof he made ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
of graine, that he had ſufficient to ſerve
the people during thoſe fore-told ſeven
yeares; whereas elſe hee had wanted proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for his people. <hi>Katherine de Medicis,</hi>
Queen of France, and wife to <hi>Henry</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
dreamed the very ſame day before the
ſaid King was wounded to death, that ſhee
ſaw him very ſickly, holding downe his head
as he walked downe the ſtreets of Paris, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
followed by an infinite company of his
people that lamented for him: hereupon ſhee
moſt earneſtly intreated him (and as is ſaid)
with wringing hands upon her knees, not to
adventure into the ranke of Tilters on that
day; but hee giving no heed to her words,
the laſt day of the feaſting for the marriage
of Madam <hi>Margret,</hi> ſiſter to <hi>Emanuel Philli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
Duke of Savoy, for her honour; and
turning to breake a Lance againſt a bold and
valiant Knight (to wit) the Count of Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery,
<pb facs="tcp:156887:8"/>
happened to bee wounded: for in
the Lances breaking on both ſides, a ſhiver
or Splinter entred by the ſight of his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,
and ſtrucke very farre into his head.
The King died ſoone after of this wound, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
about 40 yeares, leaving his Kingdome
lamenting his loſſe: wee may obſerve the
dreame of this great Princeſſe, and how it
happened, whereof doubtleſſe God gave
premonitions by his good Angell, both for
her good, and the whole realme of France;
but the King more deſirous to follow the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of the world, then the good advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his wife, by his deceaſe the people
of France ſuffered many calamities. His ſon
<hi>Henry</hi> 3. three dayes before he was murdred
at S. <hi>Cloa,</hi> beheld in a dream all his royall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments,
to wit, his linnen veſture, Sandals
Dalmatium robe, mantle of azure Sattin,
Crown and Scepter, bloudy and made foule
with the feet of religious men, and other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and that he himſelfe was angry with the
Sexton of the Abby of S. <hi>Dennis;</hi> &amp; albeit all
good advice was given him, according to the
danger of his dreame, ſtands ſecurely upon
his guard; yet ſo it fell out as a thing permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by heaven, that hee could not avoyd that
fatall chance, but was ſlain, whatſoever ſtrong
guard was there about him.</p>

               <hi>Calphienia</hi> wife to the adopted father of <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
having dreamed that ſhe beheld <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſlaine and
maſſacred, gave him notice thereof, but he inſtead
of converting of it to his benefit, diſpiſed the
dreame, and went to the Senate houſe, the day
following where the dreame ſorted to wofull
effect.</p>
            <p>I cannot omit the dreame and revelation of
<hi>Ioane d'Arke,</hi> the Virgin that dreamed, that ſhee
her ſelfe ſhould be the only meanes to put <hi>Charles</hi>
the ſeventh in poſſeſſion of his Kingdome. After
he had acquainted her father and mother with
her dreame, ſhe is brought to the Lord <hi>Baud<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi>
and habited like a man, is preſented to the
King. The matter ſeemed ridiculous to the King,
he takes upon himſelfe the habit of a Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
this Maid being brought into the Chamber
goeth to the King, and ſalutes him with a modeſt
countenance, and delivered to him the charge
which ſhee had received of the God of heaven,
and told him that ſhee ſhould be the meanes
to place the Crowne upon his head, and relieve
<hi>Orleance</hi> that was beſieged by the Engliſh. The
King was perſwaded to give her a Troope of
one hundred, and a good horſe. She puts her
ſelfe into a mans habit, and like a valorous
Captaine goeth toward <hi>Orleance,</hi> and relieveth
the Towne with victualls without reſiſtance.
After ſhee was in <hi>Orleance,</hi> ſhee ſends a
Letter to the King of ENGLAND, and his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:156887:9"/>
Troopes, and wiſheth them to depart without
ſhedding any more innocent blood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ioane d'Arke</hi> a ſecond time relieveth <hi>Orleance,</hi> and
brings in freſh proviſion, ſhe makes choyce of
1500 men, and enters the Fort of Saint Loope,
the virgin in the formoſt of the ranckes, crying
Saint <hi>Denis,</hi> the next day they tooke two other
Forts, on the third day, the Engliſh made the
French recoyle, but the virgin incouraging her
men, and marching couragiouſly was ſhot in
the arme; (tuſh ſaith ſhe) this is a favour, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
amazed, ſhe takes the arrow in one hand
and her ſword in the other, and enters the Fort,
in theſe three dayes the Engliſh loſt eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
men, and the French not one hundred, and
as a remembrance of their victories, the Statues
of <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeventh and <hi>Ioane d'Arke,</hi> are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
upon the Bridge of <hi>Orleance,</hi> kneeling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Crucifix.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeventh is crowned at <hi>Rheins</hi> all
<hi>Champaigne</hi> yeelds unto him, and the King that
was in great danger of looſing his Kingdome, is
now an abſolute King.</p>
            <p>I ſhall in the laſt place relate a Dreame of a
young Gentleman, which of late hapned, the
truth of which is freſh in my memory, this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
being diſquieted with the thundring of
Peeces, which his Imagination told him was in
the ayre, and not upon earth, looking towards
the heavens, he did conceive that he ſaw a great
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:156887:9"/>
Army ready to encounter with another, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the Leaders, he perceived one to be a tall
blacke man, the other low of ſtature, the tall
blacke man ran with his Rapier againſt the ſame,
and tranſported thus with fury, he ſtumbled and
fell, and as he fell divers arrowes were ſhot, ſome
out of the North, ſome out of the South, ſome
out of the Weſt, ſome out of Eaſt, as if all the
foure quarters had blowne no other blaſts, after
this appeared divers like ghoſts, walking with
Croſier ſtaffes who ſeemed to harden and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the Souldiers, yet their arguments could
not win them to give battle, theſe in the twin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling
of an eye loſt their pure whitneſſe, and
ſhewed themſelves in blacke with Miters falling
from their heads, next to theſe followed a troop
of Shavelings, ſome carrying Croſſes, others
praying with Beads, but on the ſuddaine a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
of fire appeared, and they vaniſhed,
and all the heavens ſeemed to be diſturbed
looking downeward hee ſaw a grave old man
ſitting in a Chaire of State upon the top
of a mountaine, having a Septer in his hand, with
a Treple Crowne on his head, having with him
diverſe habited in long roabs and red hats, that
ſeemed to hold the chaire, whilſt his eye was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied
in the view of them, a thunder-bolt fell and
cleft the mountaine which ſwallowed them up,
then he ſeemed to paſſe through pleaſant fields,
and the firſt he met with was a young Cavalero,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:156887:10"/>
the next he met withall was a poore ſouldier, now
thovght the young gallant that he ſhould learne
what was the variance betweene theſe troupes, but
before the gentleman could ſpeake to him, the
ſouldier made towards him, and like a bold ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fian
demanded his purſe who was a little unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
yet having no remedy to prevent the taking
thereof did deliver it, and in requitall, the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
ſaid, Come you to heare newes? in briefe it
is thus, our Generall being dead our armies were
disbanded; and having uttered the words, vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
and in his roome entred a poore Countrey
man who was very deſirous to learne whether he
met with any ſouldiers that had driven away his
cattell, for hee pitied this poore man, but could
give him no comfort in regard his money was
taken away from him: the gentleman paſſing
on, came to a great houſe that was fortified with
bulwarks, trenches and well man'd, and on
the ſide of it was an arme of the Sea, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
hee could not give the word hee was
not admitted: as hee paſſed by hee percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
one that was looking under a tree to take
the true height of a Starre: falling into confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with him hee told him what a viſion he had
ſeene, and would neeeds know what this blacke
man was that fell from heaven; the Aſtronomer
told him if he would have a little patience till he
had laid his Mathematicall Inſtruments aſide hee
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:156887:10"/>
would ſhew him his full proportion: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
drawing forth a ſmall glaſſe out of a box that
expreſſed ſuch curioſity, as if many Artiſts had
aſſembled together to compoſe it; no ſooner
was the box opened, but the beauty of that which
was contained therein, made the young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſtand and admire whether that which his eye
beheld, was the worke of Art or nature, or
both.</p>
            <p>Having taken a ſmal ribband which was of a skin
colour, from the ſides of the box, he drew forth a
glaſſe in an Ovall frame, ſet round with Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds
and rubies, the middle thereof was made
of Topaz, and ſo exactly cut, as it ſufficiently
expreſſed the skill of the Lapidary. On one ſide
of the glaſſe he could perceive this tall man habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
like a Prince, on the otherſide like a mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and by him an executioner, with this inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
over his head in great letters (worſer rul'd not
traytors head muſt off) now Sir ſaid the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer
caſt up each Letter of this inſcription,
and you ſhall finde out his name and title,
the which hee preſently and readily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke,
by transplacing the Letters, and found
it to be Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth</hi> Lord <hi>Strafford:</hi>
It was no ſmall wonder to him, to ſee that
his Lordſhips name and title ſhould ſo true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
divine his nature and fortune, no ſooner had
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:156887:11"/>
this aſtronomer ſhewed this glaſſe, but he vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and making a horrible noyſe at his departure,
the Gentleman awaked, and ſell againe into a
ſweet ſlumber, and ſoone after gave this Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to divers.</p>
            <p>I am of opinion with <hi>Volaterans,</hi> that many
times a perſon going to his reſt, not cloyed with
bad affections, nor ſuperfluity of food; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vertuouſly minded, and healthfully diſpoſed,
his ſoule in ſleeping may foreſee things to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for the ſoule, which of it ſelfe is divine and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall,
being not offended with any evill cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
or over-bad meats, is at free liberty, and
beſt performeth her actions when the body ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth,
not being buſied with any other matters.</p>
