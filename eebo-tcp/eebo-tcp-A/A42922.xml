         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>§. 1. A <hi>Written Teſtament</hi> is ſuch as at the time of making thereof is committed to writing. <note n="a" place="margin">Mynſ. Inſt. de teſta. ord. §. Sed cum paulat.</note> By which words are excluded ſuch Teſtaments as are afterwards put into writing. For being firſt made by word of mouth they ſtill remain <hi>Nuncupative,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the reducing thereof into writing after the Teſtators death. <note n="b" place="margin">Mynſ. ibid. §. fin.</note> Among other advantages that a Teſtator hath by a <hi>written</hi> Will this is one; that he may conceal the Contents there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of from the Witneſſes, <note n="c" place="margin">L. hac con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult.

                     </p>
                     <p>2. As touching the diſpoſition of Land of Inheritance by Will, if it be not fully written before the Teſtators death, ſo far at leaſt as concerns the diſpoſition of the ſaid Land, it may not be for that part made good by reducing it to writing after the Teſtators death; but as touching Goods and Chattels it may. <note n="e" place="margin">Offic.

                     <p>3. Lands and Tenements deviſeable by Cuſtome may paſs by

a <hi>Nuncupative</hi> Will for any time whatſoever; for in a Deviſe of Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments held in Burgage-tenure, it is not neceſſary that the ſame ſhould be written, becauſe ſuch may paſs ſufficiently by Will Nuncupative, <note n="h" place="margin">Swinb. part. 1. §. 11. n. 5.</note> becauſe ſuch Lands were deviſeable before the making of the Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 8. enabling to deviſe Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments by Will in writing in the Teſtators life-time, which cannot paſs by a <hi>Nuncupative</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament or Will without writing: <note n="i" place="margin">Stat.

                     <p>4. Though the naming or appointing of an Executor be eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to conſtitute a Teſtament or Laſt Will, yet this properly refers only as to Goods and Chattels; for a man may by his Laſt Will in writing deviſe his Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments, though he make no Executors, becauſe an Executor hath nothing to do with the freehold of Land.</p>

Military Teſtaments. 2. Teſtaments made in favour of the Teſtators Children. 3. Teſtaments for good and pious uſes.</p>
                     <p>2. The <hi>priviledges</hi> of <hi>Military</hi> Teſtaments, or of a Teſtament made by a Souldier are many, but chiefly theſe Four; <hi>viz.</hi> 1.

                     <p n="1">1. A <hi>Codicil</hi> in the Etymologie thereof, doth ſignifie a little Book, <hi>Codicillus</hi> being but the diminitive of <hi>Codex:</hi> you may if you pleaſe call a Teſtament a great Book, and a Codicil a little Book or writing. The Original of theſe Codicils was meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occaſional; for when by reaſon of the multiplicity of legal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities requiſite to a Teſtament, which are not ſo to a Codicil, the Teſtator failing of ſufficient opportunity to make a Teſtament Solemn, was enforced to fly to the refuge of a Codicil for decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Will to be performed <hi>poſt mortem:</hi> Or otherwiſe as additional to the Teſtament, touching ſomething therein omitted; or explanatory to it, touching ſomething therein ambiguous; or derogatory to it, touching ſomething therefrom to be detracted.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. IT is agreed by all, that Five Pounds is the ſumm or value of <hi>Bona Notabilia;</hi> provided that where by compoſition or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome in any County <hi>Bona Notabilia</hi> are rated at a greater ſumm, the ſame is to continue unaltered; as in the Dioceſs of <hi>London</hi> it is Ten Pounds by compoſition; <note n="a" place="margin">Coke part. 4. Inſtit. cap. 74. verb. Prerogat. Court.</note> Provided alſo that if any man die <hi>in itinere</hi> or in a journey, the Goods that he hath then about him or with him ſhall not be as <hi>Bona Notabilia</hi> to cauſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration to be committed, or the Will to be Proved in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative. <note n="b" place="margin">Offic. Exec. c. 4. §. 2.</note> Nor is it neceſſary that the party muſt have five pounds in each and every of the ſeveral Counties where his Goods are diſperſed, but it is ſufficient if the party deceaſed were poſſeſſed of Goods and Chattels in ſome other County than that wherein he lived and died to the full value of five pounds beſides thoſe Goods extant in the County where he died. So that although the deceaſed's Goods and Chattels do amount to Ten Pounds or more, yet if the Goods and Chattels extant in ſome other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty do not extend to Five Pounds at the leaſt, the deceaſed is not to be accounted to have <hi>Bona Notabilia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Regularly the Will is, as hath been ſaid, to be Proved in the Eccleſiaſtical Court of the ſame County where the Teſtator is an Inhabitant, or wherein he made his moſt uſual reſidence and aboad for the latter years before his death, and not in the Eccleſiaſtical Court of that County wherein he made his Will, or wherein he died, but where his laſt place of habitation was; but if the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator died poſſeſſed of Goods to the value of Five Pounds, called <hi>Bona Notabilia,</hi> in divers Counties, then the Will is to be Proved in the Prerogative Court, to which alſo Appeals from any other inferiour Juriſdiction: So that the Prerogative Court of the Arch-Biſhop
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49414:26"/>
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> is the Court wherein all Teſtaments are to be Proved, and all Adminiſtrations to be granted, where the party dying within his Province hath <hi>Bona Notabilia</hi> in ſome other Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs than that wherein he died, which regularly is to be to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of Five Pounds, ſave where by cuſtome or compoſition it is at any greater ſumm, as aforeſaid. Alſo if any Teſtator die not poſſeſſed as aforeſaid, and the Executor notwithſtanding Prove the Will in the Prerogative, ſuch Probate ſhall ſtand good: But it is otherwiſe if the Will be Proved in the Inferiour Juriſdiction when the Teſtator dies poſſeſſed, as aforeſaid, of <hi>Bona Notabilia;</hi> for in ſuch caſe it is again to be Proved in the Prerogative. And if a man hath Goods in divers Dioceſſes or Provinces, and make his Executor of his Goods in one of the Provinces, and die Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate as to his other Goods: And if the Ordinary do commit Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Goods which are in the other Province unto the ſaid Executor, then is he both Executor and Adminiſtrator, and the party died both Teſtate and Inteſtate. <note n="c" place="margin">35 H. 6. 36.</note> And if a man died Inteſtate having <hi>Bona Notabilia</hi> in divers Dioceſſes, the Judge uſed to Aſſeſs a convenient ſumm to be imployed <hi>in pios uſus,</hi> but with and under certain limitations, <note n="d" place="margin">Coke ubi ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra.</note> or legal reſtrictions.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Debts owing to the Teſtator are held <hi>Bona Notabilia</hi> as well as Goods in poſſeſſion, their value being anſwerable; yet if the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſumm of a Bond be but Five Pounds for the payment of a leſs ſumm, although the Bond be forfeited, yet that is not underſtood as <hi>Bona Notabilia,</hi> although in Law the whole penal ſumm be a Duty. <note n="e" place="margin">Offic. Exec. ubi ſupra.</note> And thoſe Debts are ſaid to be <hi>Bona Notabilia,</hi> where the Bonds or other Specialties are, and not where the Debtors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit; ſo that if the Bonds be in the County where the Teſtator died, and the Debtors in another County, in this caſe the Will is not to be Proved in the Prerogative Court; but in caſe the Debts are only by Contract without Specialty, they are then to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Bona Notabilia</hi> there and in that place where the Debtor is. But in caſe Lands be by Will given to be Sold for payment of Debts and Legacies, this is not to be accounted as <hi>Bona Notabilia,</hi> though it be Aſſets; <note n="f" place="margin">Ibid.</note> for where Land is bequeathed to be ſold for ſuch uſes, there neither the money raiſed thereby, nor the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits thereof ſhall be accounted as any of the Teſtators Goods or Chattels.</p>

One had Goods ſolely in an Inferiour Dioceſs; and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan of the Province pretending that he had <hi>Bona Notabilia</hi> in divers Dioceſſes, committed the Adminiſtration of the Goods. It was reſolved, that ſuch Adminiſtration granted by the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan, was not void, but voidable by Sentence, becauſe the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan hath Juriſdiction of all places within his Province. But if the Ordinary of one Dioceſs committeth Adminiſtration of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49414:26"/>
Goods when the party hath <hi>Bona Notabilia</hi> in divers Dioceſſes, the Adminiſtration is void as well for his Goods within the Dioceſs, as without. <note n="g" place="margin">22 Eliz. in C. B. <hi>Vere and Jefferys Caſe.</hi> Co. 5. part. 29.</note>

Again, the poſſeſſory Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels real may be divided into things living, or into things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life. Alſo the perſonal Chattels or Goods moveable may be divided into things living, or things inanimate and without life. There are alſo comprehenſive of ſome of theſe, Chattels principal, and Chattels acceſſory that follow the principal. So that Chattels are all poſſeſſions of Goods moveable and unmoveable, except ſuch as are in the nature of a Free-hold or parcel of it. And they are called real or immoveable, either becauſe they are ſuch in their own nature; or becauſe they appertain to ſomething real by way of dependance, as a Box with writings of Land, the body of a Ward, the fruit of a Tree, or the Tree it ſelf upon the Land; or becauſe they iſſue out of things immoveable and of a more real nature, as Leaſes for years, at Will, Wardſhips, Tenants Eſtates by Statute Merchant, Staple, or Elegit, and Grants of the next Advowſon.</p>

                        </list>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THe Power of an Executor dependeth wholly upon the Will and deſignment of the Teſtator. Now an Executor may before his Proving of the Will, ſeize and take into his hands any of the Teſtators Goods; yea, enter into the houſe of the Heir, if not locked, ſo to do, and to take the Specialties of debts; and generally, he may do all things which to the Office of an Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor pertaineth, except only bringing of Actions and proſecution of Sutes; <note n="a" place="margin">Offic. Ex. c. 3. §. 1. &amp; 9 Ed. 3. fol. 33. 47. &amp; 7 H. 4. 18.</note> for they cannot Sue till they have the Will under the Seal of the Probat-Office.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Although an Executor may after the Teſtators death enter into the houſe where he lived and died, and where his Goods are; and thence take them away even before Probate of the Teſtament, yet underſtand it with this caution, That he muſt do this within convenient and reaſonable time, as within or about thirty dayes next after the Teſtators death; and that alſo in a due and peaceable manner when the doors are open. <note n="b" place="margin">Littl. Sect. 69. Plowd. 281. Bro. tit. Execut. 129.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. An Executor may alſo before Probat of the Will pay debts and receive debts, and make acquittances of debts owing to the Teſtator: Yea, if before ſuch Proving of the Will the day be come for payment upon Bond made by or to the Teſtator, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be made by or to this Executor, though the Will be not yet Proved, and that upon like pain of forfeiture, as if the Will were Proved. <note n="c" place="margin">Offic. Ex. ubi ſup. Coke 6. 18. 9. 38. 5. 27. Plowd. 280. 9 Ed. 4. 47. 36 H. 6. 7. Fitzh. tit.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49414:51"/>
bequeathed in the Wiil, and for the ſame may maintain his Action.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. For an Executor for Goods of the Teſtator taken from him, or for a Treſpaſs done upon the Leaſe Lands, or for a diſtraining or impownding of the Goods or Cattel, may maintain Actions of Treſpaſs or Replevin or Detinue even before the Will be Proved, becauſe theſe Actions ariſe out of the Executors own poſſeſſion. <note n="d" place="margin">Dyer in Plo. Com. 281. <hi>Caſe of Greisbr.</hi> &amp; <hi>Fox.</hi>
                        </note> But an Action of Debt or the like contracted by the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor he cannot maintain before the Will be Proved, for therein he muſt ſhew forth the Will Proved under the Court-Seal. And as at the Common Law, If a man be bound to another in a certain ſumm of money to pay at a certain day, and the Obligee before the ſaid day Releaſe unto the Obligor all Actions, he is barred of the duty for ever, though he could not have an Action at the time of the Releaſe made; even ſo may an Executor before Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of the Teſtament Releaſe an Action. <note n="e" place="margin">Trin. 2 Jac. in Com. Ban. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Middleton</hi> &amp; <hi>Rinnot.</hi> 18 H. 6. 23. <hi>b.</hi> Pl. Com. 277, 278. in <hi>Greisbrooks Caſe.</hi> per <hi>Weſton.</hi> vid. Coke, lib. 3. cap. 8. Sect. 512.</note> And the Reaſon of both is, becauſe the right of Action is in them, for that the Debt is a thing conſiſting meerly in Action; and therefore though no Action as yet then lieth for the Debt, yet becauſe the Right of Action is in them, the Releaſe of all Actions is a diſcharge of the Debt it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Another thing that an Executor may do before the Proving of the Will, and which is expedient for him, though as yet not ſo neceſſary, is the making of an Inventory; for the Executor had need be cautious that he do not intermeddle with, or Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Teſtators Goods until he hath made an Inventory; for although the Act of an Executor is ſaid to hold in Law before the Proving of the Will, <note n="f" place="margin">Plowd. in Caſ. inter <hi>Greis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook</hi> &amp; <hi>Fox.</hi>
                        </note> and the making of an Inventory; <note n="g" place="margin">Lynwood in C. Statut. §. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventarium. tit. de Teſta. lib. 3. Conſt. Prov. Cant. verb. prius.</note> yet for intermeddling with the Teſtators goods as Executor before he hath made an Inventory, or cauſed the ſame to be made, though not exhibited, he was according to Law puniſhable; <note n="h" place="margin">Legat in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertatem de Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut. Teſtam.</note> unleſs it were for doing ſuch things as could not conveniently be defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red till the Inventory were made, as concerning things relating to the Funerals, or diſpoſing ſuch things as <hi>Servando ſervari non poſſint,</hi> and ſuch like. <note n="i" place="margin">Jo. de Atho. in dict. Legat in Libertatem. verb. inventarium. dict. C. Statut. §. inhibemus. in Text. &amp; in Gloſs,</note> Beſides, if he make not an Inventory and yet Adminiſter, he may be compelled to diſcharge out of his own purſe more Debts and Legacies than happily the Teſtators Goods and Chattels did amount to.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. There are ſeveral other things which an Executor may do before he hath Proved the Will; and he may alſo keep any of the Goods of the Teſtator, ſo as he pay out of his own money the value thereof in Adminiſtration of the Teſtators Eſtate; <note n="k" place="margin">Dyer 2.</note> he may alſo if he want money to pay Funerals, or diſcharge Debts, ſell any of the Chattels Real or Perſonal, whereof the Teſtator died poſſeſſed, yea, though that thing were particularly bequeath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49414:52"/>
As if a man be poſſeſſed of a Term of years, and bequeath the ſame to <hi>A. B.</hi> the Executor may notwithſtanding the bequeſt at any time before his Aſſent given to the Legacy, if he have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not Aſſets ſufficient to pay the Debts, ſell this Term of years, and the Legatee is remedileſs. So alſo he may do, although there be Aſſets enough beſides to pay the Debts; but in ſuch Caſe the Legatee may not be without all relief in a Court of Equity againſt the Executor as to Dammages; but the Sale is unavoidable. <note n="l" place="margin">Plowd. 543, 544.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Leſſee for years Deviſed his Term to one whom he made his Executor, and died: The Deviſee entered before any Probate of the Will, and held and enjoyed the Land for a year and more, without Proving of the Will, and then died; it was a Queſtion, whether his Executor, or in Caſe he died Inteſtate, his Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator ſhould have the Term? It was the Opinion of the Court, That the Term was lawfully ſetled in the Executor by his Entry; and it was a good Execution of the Deviſe, without any Probate made of the Will. <hi>Mich. 22 Eliz. Dyer,</hi> 367.</p>
                     <p>Letters of Adminiſtration do relate to the time of the death of the Inteſtate, and not to the time of the granting of them; and <note place="margin">Mich. 1652. B. R. <hi>Long</hi> &amp; <hi>Hobbs Caſe. Stiles</hi> 341.</note> therefore an Adminiſtrator may have an Action of Treſpaſs, or a Trover and Converſion for Goods, taken by one before the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters granted to him; otherwiſe there would be no Remedy of the wrong done.</p>
                     <p>Executors took the Teſtators Goods before they had Proved the Will; another took Letters of Adminiſtration, and takes the Goods out of the Executors hands before the Will was Proved: <note place="margin">Paſch. 42 Eliz. Anderſ. Rep. par. 2. Caſe. 83.</note> The Executors bring their Action of Treſpaſs againſt him who took the Goods; the Court held that it did well lie; for after the Teſtators death the Goods belong to the Executors, and to none other; and an Adminiſtration to intermeddle with theſe Goods is utterly void; for that they have nothing to do with thoſe Goods as Adminiſtrator when there is an Executor.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. An Executor may retain Goods in ſatisfaction of a Debt due to him from the Teſtator, and the Retainer ſhall be held good. <note n="m" place="margin">Plow. Com. 184.</note> Action of Debt was brought againſt the Executors of <hi>A. B.</hi> who pleaded that they had fully Adminiſtred; the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff gave Evidence that they had Goods in their hands; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant ſhewed, that the Goods were pledged by their Teſtator, and that they had Redeemed them with their own money to the full value; and that for the reſt of the Goods, that they had paid to the Teſtator as much for them as they were worth: It was holden, That the ſame did well maintain their Iſſue of Fully Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred; for that an Executor ſhall by way of Retainer be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced that which he hath paid. <note n="n" place="margin">6 H. 8.

                        </note> The like we have in another Caſe. Two men were poſſeſſed of Goods as Executors; the one of them took the goods into his hands, and diſpoſed of divers ſumms of money <hi>in pios uſus, &amp; pro anima Teſtatoris,</hi> which ſumms did amount to more than the Goods of the Teſtator were worth; and he did retain the Teſtators Goods as his own proper goods, converting the ſame to his own uſe, whereof he died poſſeſſed, after he had made his Will, and therein Executors. The ſurviving Executor brought <hi>Detinue</hi> of the ſaid Goods againſt the Executor to the value of One hundred pound, upon which the Defendant pleaded the matter <hi>Supra.</hi> It was adjudged, That the Retainer was Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; and that thoſe Goods now in the hands of the Executors, were not Aſſets or Goods of the firſt Teſtator in the Executors hands. <note n="p" place="margin">Mich. 2 Eliz.

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Executor in making of an Inventory ought to call Two at leaſt of the Teſtators Creditors or Legataries, or upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal or abſence Two other honeſt perſons, and in their preſence ſhall make a true and perfect Inventory of all the Teſtators Goods, Chattels and Credits; and the ſame ſhall be indented, whereof one part ſhall be by the ſaid Executor upon his Oath for the Truth thereof left in the Regiſtry of the Court, the other part to remain with himſelf. In which Inventory the Teſtators Goods and Chattels are particularly to be valued and apprayzed at their true and juſt value. And all ſuch Goods and Chattels as are contained in the Inventory are preſumed to have belonged to the Teſtator, and now to the Executor, and no more. Therefore if a Creditor or Legatary affirm, that the Teſtator had at his death more Goods than are compriſed in the Inventory, he muſt prove the ſame; for ſuch an Inventory by the Civil Law cannot be diſproved, unleſs the number of the Witneſſes be twice as many in number as they which do Prove it; <note n="d" place="margin">Fulb.

Likewiſe, as it is frequent in uſe for Executors to pay the Teſtators Debt with their own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and to make themſelves ſatisfaction out of the Teſtators Goods: So it is moſt equal, that Executors ſhould with their own money diſcharge the Arrerages of Rent of thoſe Leaſes, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits whereof themſelves enjoy by vertue of the Teſtators Will: Therefore where an Executor is ſued for Rent behind, after the

(1.) For that the Plea was a void Plea; for the Record which the Defendant pleaded, was ſuch as the Plaintiff doth confeſs and avoid, and not like that which is every way falſe; as when one pleads that he never was Executor, nor Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49414:58"/>
as Executor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Plea being every way falſe, and ſo within his own knowledge alſo, doth for that Reaſon cauſe that Judgement in that Caſe ſhall be of his own proper Goods. (2.) Another Reaſon is, That becauſe ſuch Judgement is moſt agreeable to Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> To give the Plaintiff Recovery of his Debt out of the Teſtators and not the Executors Goods, which is conceived a more reaſonable way than to charge the Executors; for that they bear the burthen of the Adminiſtration of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſeds Will, they deſerve to have as much favour as Reaſon will admit, and not be charged of their own proper Goods. It was further ſaid, That if an Executor ſhould be lyable to ſuch Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own Goods, it would be a cauſe of often refuſing the Adminiſtration of Teſtaments, for it is a thing of ill conſequence to bind Executors in their own proper Goods in any other Caſes than have been in fore-time adjudged; which Caſes were cited out of divers Books, but here omitted for brevities ſake; none of which Caſes have any reſemblance with this in queſtion.</p>

for his Diet for Thirty years together, which was paid him by the Command of the Lord Treaſurer; who had Authority by Privy Seal to make allowance and payment of all Fees due, but in truth, theſe were not any due Fees: And whether his Executor ſhall be charged with theſe Summs ſo received, was the Queſtion. And after Argument it was adjudged, that he ſhould be charged; for it was held, That this payment of the money by the appointment of the Lord Treaſurer, was not allowable; for the Privy Seal is not ſufficient Authority to diſpoſe of the Queens Treaſure, unleſs where it is due; and he diſpoſing of it otherwiſe, it is out of his Authority.

Q. Whether a Recovery in this Action againſt an Executor, is allowable againſt a debt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Obligation, if it ſhould be an Adminiſtration; for then it would be miſchievous to Creditors; and if it ſhould not be an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, it would then be miſchievous to Executors, that they ſhould be charged therein, and not have allowance thereof againſt other Creditors; for it may be, that at the time of the Recovery they did not know of other debts.

                        <hi>pendente Lite</hi> in the Eccleſiaſtical Court is not lawful, but is a Tort to the Plaintiff, and that the Sentence there proves, which is, that all things attempted or done <hi>pendente Lite</hi> ſhall be void, and the Juſtices ought to have regard to the Civil Law in this point, as in 27 <hi>H. 6. Guard, 118. 2 R. 2. Quare impedit,</hi> 143. and 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 13. And by the Sentence it appears, that the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration is revoked as if it never had been; and upon this reaſon it is in <hi>Dyer</hi> 339. where an Adminiſtrator recovered a debt, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards another procured himſelf to be joyned in the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and releaſed the debt, and afterwards it being revoked, this releaſe was not any bar to the execution. And <hi>Mich. 25, 26 Eliz.</hi> in the Common Bench between <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Cary</hi> this very point was in queſtion, and adjudged, that the Action lay. <hi>Gawdy,</hi> The Action well lies, for the Sentence doth not repeal mean Acts done by an Adminiſtrator which are for the Inteſtates benefit; but foraſmuch as theſe Goods were not converted or imployed for the Inteſtates uſe, it is reaſonable that he ſhould be charged for them. <hi>Popham</hi> and <hi>Fenner è contra.</hi> For the Adminiſtrator hath an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute intereſt and power to diſpoſe of the Goods, untill the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal be made; and it is not like unto an Appeal upon a Sentence, for that makes it as no Sentence; but the Repeal of the Letters of Adminiſtration doth not void it <hi>ab initio,</hi> and make a lawful Act Tortious, but rather in this Caſe the new Adminiſtrator ſhall have an account for the money received; and the words in the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence are not to be regarded, for they are common and ordinary in all Sentences. So he having the Goods lawfully, and convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them lawfully, ſhall not anſwer for them as for a Tort done. And <hi>Popham</hi> here ſaid, If Adminiſtration being committed, the <hi>Ordinary</hi> commit new Adminiſtration, it is a Repeal of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer without any Sentence of Appeal; and if the firſt Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator waſt the Goods, the Debtee ſhall have the Action againſt him; and if he pleads that Adminiſtration is committed over, he may well by this Replication maintain it, becauſe he waſted the Goods when he was Adminiſtrator, wherefore <hi>&amp;c.

                     <p n="3">3. Although Executors are in Law underſtood as the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentees of their Teſtators perſons, yet if the Teſtator in his life-time commit any Treſpaſs either upon the Perſon, Lands or Goods of another, no Action lyeth againſt his Executor for the ſame; the reaſon is, <hi>Actio perſonalis moritur cum perſona,</hi> as hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly declared: Hence it is, that there is no remedy in Law to compel Executors, though they have Aſſets, to make ſatisfaction of a Treſpaſs done by the Teſtator in his life-time; for every Treſpaſs dyeth with the perſon. <note n="h" place="margin">Dr. &amp; Stu. lib. 2. cap. 10.</note> And therefore alſo it is that no Action lyeth againſt the Executor of him who in his life-time carried away his Corn, Hay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without ſetting forth the Tenth, and died before recovery had againſt him for the ſame, although during his life the treble value were recoverable againſt him in an Action of debt; and this holds true, though the Teſtator were a Leſſee for years, ſo as his State came to his Executors. The Law is the ſame, and upon the foreſaid Reaſon and Rule in Law, if a Leſſee for years commit waſt and die, no Action lyeth againſt his Executor for this waſt. Yet the Law is otherwiſe againſt Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Eccleſiaſtical perſons in caſe of Dilapidations; for if a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Vicar do ſuffer the buildings of his Benefice to go to decay, and dies; his Executors are lyable by the Spiritual Law to the Succeſſors Sute.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. An Executor ſhall not be charged with, nor in reſpect of any other Goods than thoſe which came to his hands after his taking upon him the charge of the Executorſhip, or by vertue thereof. And although the Executor of an Executor ſhall anſwer others to whom the firſt Teſtator was indebted, as much as he ſhall recover of the Goods of the firſt Teſtator; yet if that Executor did Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enate and Convert to his own uſe all the Goods which did belong to the former Teſtator; in this Caſe no Action doth lye againſt the Executor of the Executor for Recovery of any debts due by the firſt Teſtator.

Alſo by the Laws of this Land an Executor ſhall not be charged by any bequeſt made by his Teſtator of the Goods that did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to another man. Indeed by the Civil Law it is otherwiſe, for there it is lawful for the Teſtator to bequeath another mans Goods, which the Heir at the Civil Law muſt buy, or pay the value there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if the Owner will not ſell them.</p>

Gaudy,</hi> The Action is well brought in the <hi>Debet:</hi> For this Rent, though Arrear after the death of the Inteſtate, begun firſt in the Adminiſtratrix, and therefore the Action well lies againſt her in the <hi>Debet:</hi> For the reaſon why the Action againſt an Executor ſhall be in the <hi>Detinet,</hi> is for that the debt grew due by the Teſtator; and therefore it cannot be ſaid that Executor <hi>Debet.</hi> But in an Action againſt the Heir it ſhall be in the <hi>Debet</hi> and <hi>Detinet,</hi> becauſe he is bound by ſpecial words in the Obligation; and here the debt which in the time of the Adminiſtratrix occurr'd, is her debt; and in <hi>Dyer 6 Ed.</hi> 6. 81. the Action is brought in the <hi>Debet</hi> and <hi>Detinet</hi> for Rent Arrear in the time of the Executor, and admitted to be good. <hi>Popham</hi> accord. For the being charged with the Rent in her time, it accrews by reaſon of the Profits of the Land, which ſhe her ſelf received, and therefore ſhe is charged, having <hi>quid pro quo.</hi>
                        <pb n="158" facs="tcp:49414:83"/>
For if an Executor hath a Leaſe for years of Land of the value of Twenty pound <hi>per Ann.</hi> rendring Ten pound <hi>per Ann.</hi> Rent, it is Aſſets in his hands only for Ten pound over and above the Rent. <hi>Fenner</hi> agreed to this Opinion, and to that purpoſe cited 10 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 11. That the Husband ſhall be charged after the death of the Feme for Rent Arrear in his own time, becauſe he received the Profits of the Land: So as the Rent grew due in reſpect of the occupation and taking of the Profits. And therefore ſhe is chargeable, and not meerly as Executrix. <hi>Clinch</hi> agreed with them; wherefore it was then adjudged for the Plaintiff. Note, That afterwards this Judgement was reverſed in the Exchequer Chamber for the point in Law: For all the Judges of the Common Bench, and Barons of the Exchequer held, That ſhe ought to be charged in the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinet,</hi> becauſe ſhe is charged only by the Contract of the Inteſtate. 5 <hi>Co.</hi> 31.</p>
                     <p>The Caſe was; One died Inteſtate in the County of <hi>York,</hi> and a Stranger prayed Letters of Adminiſtration to be granted to him, <note place="margin">Mich. 10 Jac. B. R. <hi>Stephenſon</hi> verſ. <hi>Wood.</hi> Bolſt. par. 2. 3, &amp; 4.</note> which was Repealed by the Delegates at <hi>York;</hi> there was an Appeal to the Court of Delegates in the Chancery, who did Repeal the former Sentence at <hi>York;</hi> and adjudged, that the Party made no Will, and granted Letters of Adminiſtration to him who Appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them: The Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> granted Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a ſecond perſon; and the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>York</hi> to a Third perſon, who made a Releaſe unto the Debtor of the Inteſtate; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Releaſe, debt was brought by the firſt Adminiſtrator a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Defendant, who pleaded the Releaſe made to him: And whether this grant of Letters of Adminiſtration by the Judges Delegates were good, or not, was the Queſtion. But the better Opinion of the Court was, That the Letters of Adminiſtration, which were granted by the Judges Delegates, was not good; but there being <hi>Bona Notabilia,</hi> the Adminiſtration was to be granted by the Arch-Biſhop: And it was ſaid, That if the Party who died Inteſtate, had Goods in ſeveral Provinces, both the Arch-Biſhops there having a Peculiar, might grant Letters of Adminiſtration; and although the King be Supream Ordinary, and by Delegates may do many Acts; yet the Court of Delegates cannot do this, nor have they power to Prove any Wills; for the power of the Judges Delegates, is, <hi>Poteſtas Delegata corrigere non exequi:</hi> And the Court ſaid, That it was adjudged in one <hi>Brakenburies</hi> Caſe, That the Judges Delegates had not power to grant any Letters of Adminiſtration.</p>
                     <p>An Exception was taken to a Declaration, becauſe the Plaintiff conveyed his Intereſt to an Adminiſtrator, to whom the Arch-Biſhop <note place="margin">Trin. 24 Eliz. B. R. <hi>Dorrel againſt Collins.</hi> Cro. Rep. par. 3.</note> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> did grant the Adminiſtration of all the Goods of the Leſſee, and did not ſhew how the Arch-Biſhop granted it,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49414:83"/>
either as Ordinary, or by his Prerogative: And this was held by all the Court a material Exception: But it was afterwards al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, That all the Preſidents in this Court <hi>(viz. B. R.)</hi> and in <hi>C. B.</hi> were ſo in general, without ſpecial ſhewing <hi>how;</hi> and for that they would not change the Preſidents, they diſallowed the Exception. And in this Caſe it was held, That if an Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator doth grant <hi>Omnia bona &amp; catalla ſua,</hi> a Term which he hath as Adminiſtrator doth not paſs, for it is not <hi>ſuum,</hi> but he hath it in right of the Inteſtate: But if one hath a Leaſe as Executor or Adminiſtrator of the Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> and he granteth all his right and intereſt in the Mannor, the Term which he hath as Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth paſs; for he had no other Right in it, and his intent is to paſs it, but by general words it ſhall not paſs.</p>

In Caſes where Adminiſtrations are to be granted, the Children of the deceaſed had liberty by this Law to take it within a year after the death of the deceaſed; and if they were further off of Kin, then they had only a hundred dayes to take it in, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thoſe who were to take it were Infants, Mad, Deaf, Dumb, or Blind; in which Caſes there was a longer time aſſigned.

But this difference or diſtinction being of no uſe or practice with us, let us not miſtake upon this ground, and thereby without cauſe occaſion our Theory to beget an Errour in Practice. For in very deed this difference or diſtinction is now removed by the Civil Law it ſelf; for whereas the Old Law of the <hi>Digeſts</hi> and <hi>Codes</hi> did diſtinguiſh between Kindred by the Father, and Kindred by the Mother, now by a latter Law of the <hi>Novels</hi> this difference or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction is aboliſhed.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. To the giving of Legacies, or to the making of a good and ſufficient Deviſe there are ſeveral things Required. The Perſon of the Deviſor muſt be Legally qualified to Deviſe; the thing Deviſed muſt be ſuch as is Legally Deviſable; The Deviſor at the time of making the Deviſe muſt have <hi>Animum Teſtandi;</hi> That the Deviſee or Legatary be in his Perſon ſuch as is capable of taking by way of Deviſe; That there be no Co-action on the Teſtator, but that his Will be free and independent, without fear, force, or flattery, or other Siniſter Contrivances; That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe be made in that due manner and form as it ought to be; That the thing Deviſed be Deviſed upon none other then (if any) Lawful Terms and Conditions; That the words of the Deviſe be ſuch as do clearly declare the Mind and Intention of the Deviſor; That Probate be made of the Teſtament, after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſors death; <note n="f" place="margin">Perk.

                     <p n="3">3. To find out the Teſtators mind and meaning, which is the very Index of the Teſtament, the time of making thereof is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly more conſiderable in point of Legacies, then the Time of the Teſtators death, becauſe the preſumption of Law is, That his mind is not altered, <note n="g" place="margin">L. tertia &amp; l. eum qui ff. de Probat.</note> unleſs it may otherwiſe appear by ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Evidence.

For in the Bequeathing of Legacies, as well as in the Appointing of Executors, there is for the moſt part either That which the Law calls <hi>Conditio</hi> or <hi>Modus,</hi> or <hi>Cauſa,</hi> or <hi>Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio;</hi> The two former whereof refer to the Time to Come; The two Latter to the Time Preſent or the Time Paſt. And a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration</hi> is inſtead of the Name of Perſons or Things, and is nothing elſe but a Note and Deſignation, whereby either the Perſon of the Legatary, or the Legacy it ſelf is Demonſtrated: For which Reaſon a Legacy is not rendred Void or Null meerly by Bequeathing it by a Falſe Name, or through a meer Erronious Appellation only Demonſtrative, ſo as the thing Bequeathed be certain, and Perſon of the Legatary not uncertain. <note n="b" place="margin">§. Siqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:49414:103"/>
ſuperfluous, when it is added to a thing certain and ſufficiently Demonſtrated before, and which would plainly enough appear without any ſuch Addition of that Demonſtration; and of ſuch Demonſtrations only it muſt be underſtood what is here ſaid, <hi>viz,</hi> That a falſe Demonſtration doth not vitiate the Legacy. And as a ſuperfluous Demonſtration that is in it ſelf Falſe doth not vitiate the Legacy, when it is ſuch a falſe Demonſtration of the thing Bequeathed, ſo neither when it is added to the Perſon of the Legatary. <note n="d" place="margin">L.

                        </note> In like manner a Demonſtration by the Quality is of more Force then that which is by the Confines, Bounds, or Limits of Place; Therefore if a Teſtator doth Bequeath his Cherry-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, being in ſuch a Place, nigh ſuch Neighbours, it is a good Legacy, and due, albeit it be not in that Place, but in another. <note n="f" place="margin">Rebuff. de dilat. att. 2, gl. 2, nu. 18.</note> So that it is not a Falſe Superfluous, but a falſe Neceſſary Demonſtration that doth vitiate the Legacy, and that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the very Subſtance of the Thing it ſelf Bequeathed: For from thence it is, That (as in the laſt precedent Chapt.) if the Teſtator ſay, I Bequeath Ten Pounds which I have in my Cheſt unto A.

Nothing is due to him if it be not in his Cheſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in this caſe the Demonſtration is inherent to the very Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or Subſtance of the Thing it ſelf Bequeathed.</p>

Now in order to the Reſolution of this Queſtion according to the Civil Law, (diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepant from the Common Law in this point) the known Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction is, That if the Teſtator did certainly know the thing Deviſed to belong unto another, and not unto himſelf, at the Time when he Deviſed the ſame? Then ſuch Deviſe is good, and the Executor (if there be Aſſets ſufficient) is to purchaſe the ſame, and Deliver it to the Deviſee. Otherwiſe it is, in caſe the Teſtator were Ignorant thereof, and ſuppoſed it to be his own; unleſs the True Owner conſent to the Legacy, or that it was Bequeathed to Pious uſed. <note n="c" place="margin">L. cum alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam.

The Law with us is ſo far from countenancing a Deviſe of what is another Mans, that it doth not allow the Goods and Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels which the Teſtator himſelf hath joyntly with another to be Deviſable; and therefore if there be Two Joynt-Tenants of Goods and Chattels, (as when ſuch Things are given to Two, or Two do Buy ſuch Things together) and one of them Deviſe his part of the Things to a Stranger, This Deviſe is void, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that if in this caſe the Teſtator make the other Joynt-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant his Executor, the Will as to this is void, and he ſhall not be charged as Executor for theſe Goods, but he ſhall have them altogether by Survivorſhip. <note n="i" place="margin">Perk.

                     <p>A Man poſſeſſed of a Term of Years, Deviſed the ſame in theſe words, <hi>viz. [The reſidue of my Goods, Moveable and Immoveable I give to my Son</hi> John, <hi>whom I make my Executor, and to him I give my whole Years that I have in my Farm of M. and if he die, I give it to my Daughters.] John</hi> the Executor and Deviſee proveth the Will, claiming the Leaſe according to the Will, and dyeth Inteſtate: His Adminiſtrator for good Conſideration Selleth the Leaſe that remains. Whence the doubt or Queſtion was, whether the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or the Aſſignee ſhould have the Leaſe? The Caſe was referr'd to the Two Chief Juſtices, and Juſtice <hi>Walmeſley,</hi> who all agreed, That the Aſſignee ſhould enjoy the Leaſe, and not the Daughters. Q. Whether a Deviſe to them in ſuch manner be void?</p>
                     <p>One made a Leaſe for life, after Leaſed the ſame to A. for 99. <note place="margin">Mich. 44, &amp; 45. Eliz. B. R. <hi>Spark</hi> &amp; <hi>Sparks</hi> caſe. Yelv.

Years, or the Leaſe otherwiſe determined, and after the death of the Leſſee for life, then the Leſſor granted for him and his Heirs, that the Land ſhould remain to the Executors of A. for 20. Years. Leſſee for life dyes. A. Leaſed for 20. Years Rendring Rent, and dyes Inteſtate. B. takes his Adminiſtration, and brings Action of Debt for the Rent. It was Adjudged, That it doth not lye. for it ſeem'd to <hi>Gaudy</hi> and <hi>Yelverton,</hi> That the Contingent of 20. Years was never Veſted in A. But if A. had made Executors, he might take by way of Purchaſe, (Executors being in name of Purchaſe: As in <hi>Cranmers</hi> Caſe. 14. <hi>Eliz.

                     <p>A Man made his Will in this manner, <hi>viz. [I have made a Leaſe</hi>

But a Man cannot Deviſe a Rent out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mans Land that is none of his own, nor out of that which he hath not; and therefore if one Deviſe Twenty Pounds to be iſſuing out of his Mannor of <hi>Dale,</hi> when in Truth he hath no ſuch Mannor; that Deviſe is void.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXII. Law-Caſes touching <hi>Money</hi> Bequeathed by the Teſtator.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. IN the laſt precedent Chapter, it hath been Examined how far <hi>Money</hi> may be compriſed under the notion of <hi>Goods Moveable</hi> or <hi>Immoveable</hi> bequeathed; It follows now, that for the clearer illuſtration of this Deſirable ſubject, we inſert certain Caſes in the Law touching the ſame; And becauſe when <hi>Money</hi> is bequeathed, it often happens that a more than ordinary power is given to, or Latitude left in the Executor by the Teſtator, It is requiſite in the firſt place to ſee how far a Legacy of <hi>Money</hi> left to the will of an Executor is good or not; which cannot well be Reſolved without conſidering the ſeveral ways of diſpoſal there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; as thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Teſtator ſaith <hi>[I would have</hi> 10 l. <hi>given to</hi> A. B. <hi>if my Executors mind were not againſt it]</hi> In this caſe <hi>A. B.</hi> cannot have the 10 <hi>l.</hi> unleſs he can firſt obtain the Executors conſent for it; becauſe a Legacy in that manner given is tacitely Conditional, and firſt requires the Executors Approbation even by the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors mind and intention for the performance thereof; But if once the Executor gives his conſent, he muſt then pay the 10 <hi>l.</hi> and cannot after recede from it to the prejudice of the Legatary. <note n="a" place="margin">gloſs. in §. ſic fidei com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſum. l.

B. <hi>when my Executor will, or when my Executor pleaſe.]</hi> In this caſe as in the former, the Legacy is not due till the Executor thinks fit, but muſt wait his pleaſure, and be in a dilatory Expectancy as long as he lives, or ſo long as he doth not ſay he will pay it; But if once he declare that he will pay it, and after dyes before he doth pay it, his Executor is obliged to make it good; Contrariwiſe if the Legatary dye before the Teſtators Executor declares his conſent to the payment thereof, for then it doth not accrue to the Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries Executor, becauſe it is Conditional till the Executor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares his conſent to pay it, and ſuch a Condition to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at the pleaſure of another, as that the Legacy cannot come to the Legataries Executor before the Accompliſhment thereof. <note n="b" place="margin">Gloſs. ibid.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. If the Teſtator ſaith, <hi>[I give</hi> A. B. 10 l. <hi>if my Executor will]</hi> In that caſe the Legacy is void, becauſe there the Teſtator ſubordinates his Will to the Executors, makes his Executors Will Abſolute, and his own Inſignificant. But in caſe he ſaith after this manner, <hi>viz. [If my Executor think fit, I give</hi> A. B. 10 <hi>l.
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:49414:153"/>
Or if my Executor conceive it expedient, let</hi> A. B. <hi>have</hi> 10 l.] In theſe caſes the Legacy is good, becauſe here the Teſtator ſeems not to leave it wholly to the meer will and pleaſure of his Executor, but as it were to the judgment of any honeſt or indifferent perſon, or (as the Law phraſes it) <hi>arbitrio boni viri.</hi> The Law is the ſame, in caſe the Teſtator ſaith, <hi>[if my Executor ſee cauſe for it, or it ſeem reaſonable to him. Let</hi> A. B. <hi>have</hi> 10 l. <hi>or I would have</hi> A. B. <hi>to be</hi> 10 l. <hi>the better for me.]</hi> For although a Legacy cannot be left to the meer will and pleaſure of the Executor, yet to his juſt and reaſonable will it may; for ſo it is left more to Reaſon than to his Will.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But what if the Teſtator ſaith <hi>[I give</hi> 10 l. <hi>to</hi> A. B. <hi>if he ſhall deſerve it of my Executor]</hi> In that caſe the Legacy is due in caſe the Legatary ſhall carry it no otherwiſe towards the Executor than as any honeſt man would or might do in the like caſe; or no otherwiſe, than as any honeſt and indifferent perſon might or would be well ſatisfied therewith. Likewiſe if the Teſtator ſaith, <hi>[I give</hi> A. B. 10 l. <hi>if he hath not offended my Executor]</hi> the Legacy is due, if it appears that <hi>A. B.</hi> hath behaved himſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Executor no otherwiſe than what would ſatisfie any reaſonable and impartial man. In a word, when it is left wholly to the meer free and arbitrary will and pleaſure of the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, the Legacy is void; but when it is left to his will, only as it ſhall ſeem meet, juſt, and equal to him, it is good; for if in it ſelf it be juſt and equal, the Executor may not interpret it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. <note n="g" place="margin">Gloſs. ibid. lit. o. verb. arbitrium.</note>

                     <p n="1">1. THings in Action, as Debts, are Deviſeable by Will; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Teſtator bequeath any Debt due to him on an Obligation, or a Contract, or the like, the Bequeſt is good; for Obligations, as alſo Counterpanes of Leaſes and the like may be Deviſed; only the Legatary cannot ſue upon the Obligation in his own Name, nor enter for the Condition broken upon the Leaſe, if there be cauſe; but he may cancel, give, ſell, or deliver up the Obligation to the Obligor, or ſurrender the Counterpane to the Leſſee. <note n="a" place="margin">Perk. Sect. 527.</note> And it is an infallible Rule, That whatſoever may come to the Executor after the Teſtators death in reſpect of his Executorſhip, may be Deviſed by the laſt Will and Teſtament of the Teſtator. Therefore a Teſtator may bequeath a Debt due to him, and if he doth not make the Legatary his Executor as to that Debt, and he who is his Executor, ſhall refuſe to ſue the Debtor, that ſo the Legatary may receive it, in this caſe the Legatary may compel the Executor either to recover it himſelf, and ſo to pay it to the Legatary, or to give him power to ſue for and recover it himſelf in the Executor's Name; And this the Legatary may compel the Executor unto by conventing him before the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> and on pain of Eccleſiaſtical cenſures to make him a Letter of Atturney for recovery of the Debt to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed, in the Executor's Name, in caſe the Executor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf doth not ſue for it for the Legataries uſe, who cannot otherwiſe ſue the Debtor, becauſe he doth not repreſent the Teſtators perſon. But if it be ſuch a Caſe of Action as is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether uncertain, as where a man hath an Action againſt another for taking away his Goods, or for ſome Treſpaſs done, the Teſtator in his life time, or to compel another to make an Accompt, or the like; ſuch Caſes of Action are not De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Now the Law takes notice but of four wayes, within the Circumference whereof all Legacies relating to Debts do fall; As (1) when the Creditor bequeaths to one what his Debtor owes him; Or (2) when he bequeaths it to the Debtor himſelf; Or (3) when the Debtor bequeaths to the Creditor; Or (4) when a third perſon bequeaths to a Creditor what his Debtor owes. Suppoſe therefore that a Creditor <hi>ſhould bequeath to one what</hi> A. B.

                        <hi>owes him,</hi> without expreſſing either the thing or the quantity; in this caſe he ſeems to bequeath his right of Action, nothing elſe; So that the Teſtators Executor is no way obliged to ſuch Legatary further than to deliver him the Obligation or Bond, and yield his Name (if need be) to the Action. <note n="b" place="margin">l. ſi ſic. §. ſi mihi. ff. de Legat. 1.</note> Yea, though the quantity were expreſſed by the Teſtator, yet the Executor is not bound to pay it to the Legatary, if the Teſtator joyn'd the very perſon of the Debtor himſelf with the execution or payment of the Legacy, as if he ſhould ſay <hi>[I would have</hi> A.

                     <p n="1">1. THe Reaſon why Legacies and Bequeſts do ſo often prove Ineffectual, is not ſo much becauſe they were originally Null, or became afterwards void or voidable by any thing rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting either to the State or Perſon of either the Teſtator or the Legatary, or by reaſon of ſome accident happening to the thing it ſelf bequeathed: But becauſe the juſt, honeſt, and ſelf-denying Executor hath <hi>fully Adminiſtred</hi> (as the Common Plea is) and hath not Aſſets wherewith to ſatisfie the ſame. When the Legacy is originally void, it is underſtood as <hi>Null;</hi> when void by ſome ſubſequent Act relating to the State or Perſon of the Teſtator, then it is underſtood as <hi>Revoked;</hi> when by ſomething relating

                     <p n="2">2. Now a Legacy or Bequeſt may be ſaid to be Originally <hi>Null,</hi> when the Teſtator is a perſon Incapable of Deviſing at all, at leaſt of Deviſing the thing Deviſed; or when the Thing it ſelf Deviſed is not legally Deviſable, or when the Teſtators manner of Bequeathing or Deviſing is altogether illegal; or when the Legatary or Deviſee is ſuch a perſon as is not legally qualified to take by a Deviſe. Likewiſe, the Legacy or Bequeſt is void or voidable by ſomething relating to the Teſtator, when there is juſt fear in the caſe, or circumventing fraud, or immoderate flattery; It may be alſo by ſome kinds of error or uncertainty. Alſo by a ſubſequent or latter Will, or by Revocation, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellation, Ademption, Tranſlation; as alſo for want of Aſſets. And when the Legacy or Bequeſt is void or voidable by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing relating to the Legatary, It is commonly either by reaſon of ſome Incapacity in his perſon to take by a Legacy or Deviſe, or by reaſon of ſome injury done the Teſtator by him and high enmity betwixt them; or by endeavouring to conceal, ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticate, or ſuppreſs the Will, or to obtrude and ſet up another in ſtead thereof, charging it with falſity; or by refuſing to do ſome poſſible and reaſonable thing incumbent by way of charge on the Legacy; or by an unwarrantable aſſuming to himſelf by his own Authority, and uſurping on the Legacy without the Executors Licenſe, conſent, or delivery thereof; or by a totall failure of ſome Condition annexed to the Legacy; or by the Legataries own waver and voluntary refuſal thereof; or laſtly by the Legataries death before the Teſtators, or before the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion performed, or before it otherwiſe becomes due. Finally, the Legacy or Bequeſt becomes void in reſpect of the thing it ſelf bequeathed, when by ſome providential and fatal accident with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any neglect or default in the Executor, the thing bequeathed doth either totally periſh, or is decay'd as that it becomes uſeleſs and unprofitable.</p>

<pb n="435" facs="tcp:49414:169"/>
pleaded payment according to the Bond; and becauſe the Eccleſiaſtical Judge would not allow the Plea, the Executor brought a prohibition, ſhewing by way of ſurmize the matter aforeſaid. <hi>Tanfield</hi> Serjeant moved for a Conſultation, becauſe the Suit was for a Legacy, which is of Eccleſiaſtical Cognizance: And albeit the Executor pleaded Payment, which is not there allowed, yet he ought not to have a prohibition, becauſe Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a good Plea in that Court; and if the Judge there will not allow it, the other may appeal to the Superiour Judge; and if this ſhould be ſuffered in the Caſe of a Legacy, then the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Court ſhould trie nothing. But (according to <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Fenner,</hi> and <hi>Yelverton,</hi> Juſtices) the Surmize is good; for the Executor by entring into Bond to the Daughter for Payment of the Legacy, had Extinguiſh'd the Legacy, and had made the 20 <hi>l.</hi> Deviſed a Debt, Suable meerly at the Common Law, and not there.</p>

                     <p>In a Replevin upon Evidence given, the Caſe was this. <hi>I.

To which it was Anſwered, That it would not: And he ſaid, If this will not hurt my Will, I will Seal it, and then he Sealed it, and a Letter of Atturney to make Livery: The Atturney made Livery in ſome of the Lands, but not in the Lands in Queſtion; afterwards the Teſtator dyed. It was ſaid,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:49414:170"/>
That the Feofment was a Revocation; for if the Teſtator had ſaid, That this ſhall not be his Will, then it had been a plain Revocation, and then the making of the Feofment is as much as to ſay, That the Will ſhall not ſtand. But it was Anſwered, and Reſolved by the whole Court, That it Appeared, That the mind of the Teſtator was, That his Will ſhould ſtand, and when he made the Feofment, this was a Revocation in Law; <note place="margin">Mich. 29 El. in B.

                     <p>The Caſe in <hi>Chancery</hi> was this, <hi>C.

He Anſwered, That his Wife was the fitteſt Perſon, and therefore ſhould be his Sole Executrix. Being then moved to give other Legacies to his Father, Brethren, and Kindred; He Anſwered, He would not leave them any thing, But Bequeathed to <hi>I. S.</hi> his God-ſon 30 <hi>s.</hi> And being Requeſted by his Wife to give him a greater Legacy; He Anſwered, Thou knoweſt not what thou doeſt; do not wrong thy ſelf, 30 <hi>s.</hi> is Money in a Poor Bodies Purſe: And the Teſtator ſpake theſe words, <hi>Animo Teſtandi, &amp; ultimam volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem declarandi.</hi> And all this was ſet down in a Codicil: And the firſt Will and the Codicil was proved <hi>in Communi forma.</hi> Whether this Codicil was a Revocation of the Legacy given to the Two Brothers, was the Queſtion, It was Reſolved both by the Civilians, and by the Judges of the Common Law, That it was not a Revocation of the Legacies. Their Reaſons were, Becauſe there was an Abſolute Formal Will made in his Health, and there being no Speech made by him of his Formal Will, nor of the Legacies thereby Deviſed. The Anſwer to a Doubtful Queſtion ſhall not take the Legacies before Deviſed: And his Anſwering, I will not give them any thing: Upon ſuch Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Speeches to Nullifie a Will adviſedly made ſhall not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, without clear and perſpicuous Revocation, or words that
