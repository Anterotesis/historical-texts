         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PHANATIQUE PRAYER,
By Sir H. V. Divinity-Profeſſor of
RABY CASTLE.</head>
            <p>WE are not here aſſembled, (<hi>moſt Glorious Lucifer</hi>) to <hi>Complement</hi> thy <hi>Infernal Majeſty;</hi> but rather to <hi>Argue,</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate,</hi>
with thee, the Reaſons of thy late with-drawings from us; and <hi>to Plead before thee, the cauſe of thy people,
in this the Day of their Tribulation.</hi> To whom ſhould the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Diſobedience</hi> repair for <hi>Comfort,</hi> and <hi>Protection,</hi>
but to the <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Patron</hi> of all <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> and <hi>Rebellion?</hi> Have not all our <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and <hi>Actings,</hi> been directed
by thy Immediate <hi>Inſpirations,</hi> and wilt thou now forſake us? Alas, Thou know'ſt, that <hi>for thy ſake, we have Subverted a Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Church;—Blaſted a flouriſhing State;—Diſſolved the beſt Temperd Conſtitution of Government in the world;—Robb'd, and
Murther'd our Fellow Subjects;—and finally waſhed our Sacrilegious Hands in the <hi>Blood of our lawfull Soveraign</hi>
               </hi> (the <hi>Beſt</hi> of
<hi>Men,</hi> and of <hi>Princes,</hi> at once) Nay, in Imitation of thy great Example, we have attempted the <hi>Dethroning,</hi> even of <hi>God
himſelf: <hi>We have made it Treaſon, to keep his Commandements;—Blaſphemie to Preach his word; Sedition, to obey the Dictates of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
and Reaſon—and to conclude;</hi> by Violence, Perjury, Schiſm, and Hereſie, we have promoted the Kingdom of Darkneſſe, in the
Land of the Living.—After all this; behold, (thou that haſt <hi>Raiſed</hi> us out of <hi>Nothing</hi>) thy Servants returning to their firſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
our <hi>Godly Exerciſes</hi> are <hi>Interrupted;</hi> and thoſe <hi>Weapons,</hi> which thy <hi>Choſen</hi> had provided for the <hi>Throats</hi> of <hi>Unbelievers,</hi> are taken
from them.—<hi>The Oath of Abjuration, <hi>is laid aſide; thy faithfull Servants, diſplaced;—Thy Miniſters, diſcouraged,</hi>
                  </hi>
               </hi>—and
(which makes the wound ſtill more Grievous) many of our Boſome friends engaged againſt us.—Nor are we conſcious to
our ſelves of any <hi>Omiſsions</hi> in order to the <hi>Great work of Reprobation,</hi> which might Provoke thy Diſpleaſure againſt us. But we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
Night and Day, in our profeſſions, ſtill bearing up againſt all oppoſition whatſoever; wear (in fine) reſolved upon <hi>Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
if we fail of <hi>Deliverance;</hi> and we have already diſpoſed of all conducements to that end. <hi>We publiſh Seditious Papers,</hi> and <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi>
to <hi>divide, and diſtract the Counſels of our Adverſaries.</hi>—We have entred into <hi>Sacramental Combinations</hi> againſt the <hi>Ungodly;</hi> and
whatſoever, either <hi>Fire,</hi> or <hi>Sword; Policy,</hi> or <hi>Perjury,</hi> can effect, ſhall not be wanting. Doſt thou not ſee (<hi>Dear Lucifer</hi>) how
dangerous and Popular a Deſign is now on Foot, for a ſettlement in Church and State? And how thoſe, that <hi>would</hi> have ſerved
thee, faithfully to their Lives end, are <hi>Forced</hi> to leave thee, for want of <hi>Pay;</hi> and <hi>Acquieſce under a Carnal Authority? a ahhh</hi>—direct
us in this our great extremity;—Proſper thoſe that are Reſolved to fight thy Battles.—Endue this Famous City of <hi>London,</hi> with
<hi>Ignorance, Faith, Wealth,</hi> and <hi>Patience:</hi> and Breathe upon the whole Nation, the Spirit of <hi>Slumber,</hi> and <hi>Deluſion:</hi> that, like a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Fools,</hi> they may <hi>Credit, Relieve,</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> us. In a Particular manner; comfort, <hi>in this their day,</hi> thy diſtreſſed Servants, <hi>Tich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,</hi>
and <hi>Ireton; keep</hi> up the <hi>Hearts,</hi> and <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> the <hi>Hands</hi> of <hi>thy choſen ones, in Authority,</hi> that they be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed,
by the Damnable <hi>Integrity</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtian Common Counſel.</hi> Confond the Anti-Diabolical Devices of <hi>Conſcience, Honour,</hi>
and <hi>Reaſon.</hi>—Guide thou the Hand of him we have appointed to murther the <hi>General;</hi> and Provide for thy <hi>Scattered Remnant,</hi>
commonly called the <hi>Rump.</hi> Fit us in our ſeveral Callings for thoſe Services unto which thou haſt reſerved us.—Give us the
<hi>Tenderneſs,</hi> and <hi>Syncerity</hi> of the <hi>Olivers;</hi>—The <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Harryes.</hi>—The <hi>Patience</hi> of <hi>Lambert.</hi>—The <hi>Perſeverance</hi> of <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw.</hi>
—The <hi>Volubility</hi> of <hi>Whitlock.—The Compunction</hi> of <hi>Haſlerigg.</hi>—The <hi>Conſcience</hi> of <hi>Ireton.</hi>—The <hi>Piety</hi> of <hi>Tichborn.</hi>—The <hi>Zeal</hi>
of <hi>Luke Robinſon.</hi>—The <hi>Continence</hi> of <hi>Mildmay.</hi>—The <hi>Modeſty</hi> of <hi>Scot.</hi>—The <hi>Courage</hi> of <hi>Atkins.</hi>—The <hi>Wiſedom</hi> of thy <hi>Similitude,
Miles Corbet.</hi>—And the <hi>Illuminations</hi> of <hi>Goodwin, Sterry,</hi> and <hi>Peters;</hi> More particularly, we beg from thee the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Obſtination:</hi>
—ah—keep us from <hi>Back-ſlidings;</hi> who knows, but thy ſervants, <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Hoyle,</hi> might have <hi>Repented,</hi> and <hi>Diſhonoured thee,</hi>
hadſt thou not ſeaſonably taken them unto thy ſelf?—Far be it from us, to Impoſe upon our <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Maſter.</hi> No, no; we
are ready to be <hi>any thing,</hi> or <hi>nothing,</hi> in order to the advancement of <hi>thy Intereſt;</hi> even as thou Pleaſeſt, any thing, but the <hi>Right,</hi> is
our Buſineſſe. The <hi>Rump</hi> of <hi>Smectymnuus,</hi> as it may be ordered with <hi>Independent Sawce,</hi> is a moſt <hi>Savoury,</hi> and <hi>Satanical
Morſel;</hi> and <hi>Diſobedience,</hi> any way <hi>Diſguiſed,</hi> or <hi>Dreſs'd,</hi> is a <hi>Diſh</hi> for thine own <hi>Palate.</hi> In order to the better <hi>Accommodation</hi> of
<hi>Schiſmatical,</hi> and <hi>Diſloyal intereſts,</hi> nothing is left undone, which either <hi>Malice, Force,</hi> or <hi>Wit,</hi> can contribute. Thy Creatures are
now at work, upon the grand Accompt, to <hi>cheat the People. Theſe, are thy Faithfull Servants, Lucifer; and they Deſerve their wages.</hi>—Like
<hi>Batts;</hi> they can both <hi>Fly,</hi> and <hi>Creep:—Shift</hi> themſelves into all <hi>Shapes;—comply</hi> with all <hi>Humours;—Change Partyes,</hi>
and <hi>Opinions,</hi> oftner than their <hi>Shirts,</hi>—and then <hi>Bewayle their wandrings.</hi> Ah, <hi>be a Gracious Devil to theſe People.</hi> Caſt an <hi>Egyptian
Darkneſſe</hi> over the whole <hi>Nation,</hi> leaſt they <hi>diſcover</hi> the <hi>Deluſion;</hi> and find, that to be <hi>Great,</hi> and <hi>Rich,</hi> is that we <hi>Fight,</hi> and <hi>Snivel</hi>
for. 'Tis a <hi>Free-Parliament,</hi> they Claim; and that we dare not for our Heads deny them,—<hi>Darken</hi> their <hi>Underſtandings,</hi> we
beſeech thee, that they may not <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> betwixt <hi>liberty,</hi> and <hi>restriction;</hi> a <hi>faction,</hi> and a <hi>repreſentation;</hi>—their <hi>own choyce,</hi> and
<hi>our impoſitions.</hi>—Send forth a <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Infatuation</hi> among theſe <hi>Infidells,</hi> to charm them into a <hi>Belief,</hi> that none are fitter to <hi>reform</hi>
their <hi>Laws,</hi> than the <hi>Subverters</hi> of them:—that thoſe, whoſe <hi>lives</hi> are <hi>forfeited</hi> to the <hi>Law,</hi> are the moſt likely Perſons to <hi>preſerve</hi>
it;—that ſuch, as offerd <hi>violence</hi> to their <hi>own Members,</hi> to keep <hi>themſelves</hi> in <hi>power,</hi> will turn <hi>themſelves out</hi> now to make way
for <hi>others.</hi> And to conclude, perſwade them, but to conſtitute thoſe people <hi>Arbitrators</hi> of their <hi>Lives,</hi> and <hi>Fortunes,</hi> that have ſpilt
<hi>Engliſh-blood,</hi> like <hi>water, and ſold their Fellow-Subjects</hi> (like <hi>Beaſts in the Market) ſix pence the Head for Slaves, to any Purchaſer,</hi>—and
then wee'll govern them (by thy aſſiſtance) <hi>in Saecula Saeculorum.</hi>
