         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Might I be ſo bleſs'd of God to live to ſee theſe dayes, I

though I were ſure to ſing a <hi>nunc dimittis—in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon:</hi>
Until then, I ſhall with ſighs and groans ſay,

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Theſe things, though moſt learned men hold they are
<hi>credenda &amp; ſperanda,</hi> yet few by their practices hold them
to be <hi>ſtretanda:</hi> indeed, one of the living Fathers of our
<hi>Engliſh Church</hi> is ſo far from hoping, <hi>That he doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the laſt of theſe three glorious things ſhall ever be in the
world:</hi> 'Tis very ſtrange to me, and that which is moſt
ſtrange, I find the ſame <hi>Author</hi> laſhing with his <hi>ſatyricall
whip,</hi> not onely thoſe that have writ amiſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but thoſe that
adventure to write upon the <hi>Revelations:</hi> but what ſaid

learned man been private in his tart expreſſions, I had not
been ſo publick: but when <hi>(Phariſee-like)</hi> ſuch learned
Doctors ſhall neither enter in themſelves, nor ſuffer others
to enter in, it would provoke a ſtone to ſpeak. What
though he underſtands it not, muſt it therefore follow,
that no body elſe underſtands it? various are the gifts of
<hi>God</hi> to his people, and it is as lawful &amp; as neceſſary for us
to ſtudy that, as any other part of the Bible: <hi>It is a ſin to be
wilfully negligent in the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>arching into thoſe Propheſies, which
give light to the times we live in: in the Revelations there are
ſhallows as well as depths; there both the Lamb may wade, and
the Elephant may ſwim:</hi> and ſo they may in <hi>Paul's Epiſtles,</hi>
and in the <hi>Evangelists,</hi> and in all the <hi>Prophets: the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

Chriſtian world; and when God ſhall turn this bright ſide to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Jews (who onely have had the dark ſide towards them
theſe 1600. years) then ſhall they be converted:</hi> the not ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying
of the Propheſies, was the groſs Hypocriſie of the
Jews. <hi>Ye hypocrites,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ye can diſcern the face of the
skie, and can ye not d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

underſtanding, or neglect of ſearching to underſtand the
prophetick texts of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> was the cauſe of the
greateſt ſin and ſcandal in the Church that ever was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and that was the murthering of Chriſt: and I am
confident the ſelf-ſame ignorance and neglect hath been
the cauſe of the greateſt ſin &amp; ſcandal that ever was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in the <hi>Goſpel-Church, and that is the ſlaying of the
witneſſes:</hi> and therefore, if ſearching after the Mind of <hi>God</hi>
in his written Word (which is all writ for our inſtruction)
be to be vild in any mans eyes, I am reſolved I will be
<pb facs="tcp:117866:3"/>
more vild in that mans eyes if I can: If <hi>reproaches, ſcoffs,
threats,</hi> or <hi>earneſt diſſwaſions</hi> of <hi>friends,</hi> or <hi>foes,</hi> could have
quenched my little <hi>ſpark,</hi> it had long ſince been out: Bt
by the grace of <hi>God</hi> I have done what I have done, &amp; his
grace is ſuperabundant to me: though 'tis true, I am alone
in regard of aſſociates in this ſtudy; yet I am not alone in
regard of aſſiſtants, for many of the ancient Fathers are
with me, and (which is all) the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are with me. I
have gone this warfare at my own great charge, and it
ſeems I muſt fight in this warfare alone. My earneſt
deſire was but to ingage a grave wit to peruſe my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and for that end theſe papers were ſent to him;
but he (like <hi>Benzoma</hi> in the <hi>Talmud)</hi> was <hi>ſem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſo that when they returned to mee againe, I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
hee had not ſo much as caſt his eye upon them,
his other imployments plied him ſo hard; ſo that my poor
papers came from this rich mans ſtudy (like <hi>Lazarus</hi> from
<hi>Dives's</hi> gate) as full of ſores as they went. From thence
they went (as I ſuppoſed) to men, but it ſeemes they met
with monſters, at leaſt with monſter-makers: Had they
ſmothered (like the worſt of <hi>Egyptian Midwives)</hi> this my
hard-favour'd babe at the place of bringing forth, it had
not been half ſo much; but in that they have, by their
pinching it, and plucking off its limbs, endeavoured to
make it a living monſter, to be a never-dying-monument
of reproach to the Father: This grieves me; but why
ſhould it grieve me? when all the world knows that the
babes of <hi>Sion</hi> are inforced to be brought forth amongſt
Aſſes in a ſtable, when the Brats of <hi>Babel</hi> lie in the beſt
Rooms of the Inn. They go forth, <hi>Cum privilegio</hi> (though
not <hi>Regiae Majeſtatis)</hi> whereas mine ſteals out by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
wayes, like <hi>Paul</hi> from his enemies, by a basket, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the wall: Conſidering the Printers care, and fear, and
<pb facs="tcp:117866:4"/>
danger, I have rather cauſe to excuſe him, then exclaim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him: I hope this book will meet with none, but
ſuch as in their wiſdom will amend ordinary faults, and
miſtakes: and for the other, I hope the <hi>Errata</hi> will inſtruct
them. Thoſe things totally left out moſt afflict me.</p>
            <p>The ſubject of the Book I gave thee in the three fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
things to be accompliſhed on each of theſe three,
I have implici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly handled theſe three Queries.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Who the Witneſſes are. 2. Where they are. 3. When
they ſhall riſe.</hi> Under this I have handled (divers from all
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Writers) who he is that ſlays the Witneſſes,
where he ſhall ſlay them, how long they ſhall be ſlain, and
where he ſhall be ſlain (and when) that ſlay them; and ſo
of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and of the <hi>Jews</hi> converſion, when they ſhall
be converted, who they are that ſhall be converted, and
by whom they ſhall be converted. This I have handled
more at large in the other little Tract called <hi>Lingua Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
which ought to be joyned to this, and was ſo intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
though the winds and ſtorms of perſecution ſevered
them. My hearty prayer to <hi>God</hi> is, that this clay and ſpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
may (by the powerful operation of <hi>Gods</hi> ſpirit) be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual,
to the opening the eyes of thoſe blind ſoules, who
by the blind are led out of the way, and both fallen into
the ditch.</p>
            <p>What I have done, is but as a Rams horn in a weak
mans hand; which one ſtone (in probability) from <hi>Jeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi>
walls is able to daſh in pieces: yet what cannot a rams
horn do, when <hi>God</hi> ſends it forth by his commiſſion? it is
able to overthrow the ſtrong walls of <hi>Jericho.</hi> In <hi>God</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
I put my truſt, he is my ſtrength, by his help have I
leaped over the wall of many difficulties; &amp; by his power
I truſt I ſhall undermine and blow up the wall of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:117866:4"/>

thoſe Princes, and bleſſed thoſe people and perſons whom
<hi>God</hi> hath given a heart to enterpriſe ſo great a work,
though they die in that ſervice, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My prayer is that this Tract may be (as that voice in</hi>
Jeruſalem <hi>before its ruine)</hi> A voyce to the Magiſtrate, and
a voice to the Miniſter, a voice to the Papiſt, and a voice to the
Proteſtant, a voice to the aged, and a voice to the young, a voice
to the rich, and a voice to the poor, and a voice to all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the Election of grace, to forewarn them to fly from the
evil to come; for be aſſured (O ye people of England) that God
will viſit you, and that ſpeedily, with his ſore and heavie judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
as you have been ſingular in ſin, ſo will God ſingle you
out to puniſhment: the day is at hand when Traytors and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-breakers
ſhall cry to the Mountains to fall upon them,

            <p>Now that I might call ſome ſouls out from amongſt

be too late, I have written this enſuing Tract with as
much plainneſſe and brevity as I could, I have pared off
all difficulties which might perplex the Reader, either in
the method, or in the ſtyle; I have given thee here the
cream of many a moneths ſtudy, which I have gathered
out of the choiceſt books in <hi>Europe.</hi> I have left no ſtone
unturned) nor any Library in England (that I could
come at) unranſackt. I expect no bribes of breath or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
but the profit of mine and thy ſoul, which is the ſoul
of profit: as to other profit I am a ſtranger; indeed I am
a great looſer, for I have conſumed both my body and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
to inrich my ſoul, and others in this ſtudy: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:117866:5"/>
but my bed and my meals have been tedious to me
ſince I undertook it; and if the Lord be pleaſed to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
it to the good but of any one ſoul, I ſhall dedicate my
whole life in praiſes to him, and account my corporall
loſſes a thouſand times repaid me. For this end, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
thee Reader, to read it, as I writ it. Sequeſtrate thy
ſelf from diſtractions, and ſit down as in the preſence of
<hi>God</hi> to ſearch after his revealed Will in theſe <hi>miſterious
texts.</hi> Watch againſt the Devils temptations, <hi>for he is moſt
buſie about a man when he ſits to meditate on theſe texts</hi> He
ſhall never profit by this, that doth not (as that Father
ſaith on the Cant.) <hi>Carnalem exuere affectum;</hi> he that
comes to this treaſury with ſmutcht and coalie heart and
hands, ſhall carry away <hi>pro theſauro carbones:</hi> If thou
therefore find not that expected ſatisfaction at the firſt
reading of this book, lay not the fault (like <hi>Senecas</hi> Nurſe)
preſently upon the book; but ſee that it be not thy fault in
reading it: I give thee this the rather, becauſe I know it
will have many Cenſurers; but I am confident few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futers:
remember (good reader) as thou muſt anſwer one
day for thy loſt hours, which are double loſs; and as for
thy ſluggiſh hearing and praying, ſo for thy ſluggiſh and
unprofitable reading of books: <hi>The Lord therefore for Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus

the Dr. (as he ſaith) foretold theſe things to come to paſſe this

Bratts are to Monarchy; but we proceed from page 20. to p. 27.

God, ſince ſuch glorious wonders are effected this day in theſe

            <p>From the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> he turns away, and betakes himſelf
in his uſe to his holy people; and in page 32. he exhorts them
to praiſe God in oppoſition to Kings, Monarchy being turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

here he doth abuſe both <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and all the Judges of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> which were abſolute Monarchs, he proceeds and tells us
that the firſt degenerate King was <hi>Nimrod;</hi> obſerve here how the

            <p>Firſt, He acknowledgeth the Office of a King to be lawful,
why elſe doth he ſay, degenerate King? for if a Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be not lawful, <hi>Nimrods</hi> Office was enough to make him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He acknowledgeth there were lawful Kings before
<hi>Nimrod,</hi> therefore he calls this <hi>Nimrod</hi> not the firſt King, but the
firſt degenerate King; here the Dr. ſpake truth not at unawares,
but premeditatively; for in page 9. He acknowledgeth, that there
was a holy King before <hi>Nimrod,</hi> and that was <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> King
of <hi>Salem,</hi> Prieſt of the moſt high God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. This <hi>Melchizedeck</hi>
he ſaith was <hi>Sem</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Noah.</hi> mark then how this wicked
perverter of the wayes of truth even againſt his Conſcience
contradicts himſelf; for in page 32. he ſtirs up the people
to praiſe God for the Deſtruction of Kingly Government and
Monarchy, that Kingdoms are turned into Common-wealths, and
Monarchy into democracy, and in page 39. brands all thoſe with
the mark of <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> which go about to uphold Kings or
Kingly Government, and yet confeſſeth that Kingly Government
is lawful Government; can any ſober-minded man give credit to
ſuch a ſelf condemned wretch, he proceeds in page 32. to rayſe at
Kingly Government, ſaying that God is angry at the peoples ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a King, and God gave them a King in anger, the 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.
the Doctor never conſiders it was their manner of asking a King
that provoked God, neither doth he conſider how that God gave
them only a King in wrath; for God continued the Office when
he deſtroyed the perſon of the King, and God himſelf thoſe <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
King, after <hi>Saul;</hi> which Government continued unremoved for

puniſhment for their ſin) removed. But the Doctor forgets
or conceals this: he proceeds to exclaim againſt the lives of Kings,
thereby to defame their Office, he calls them ambitious blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuckers,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117866:7"/>
&amp; asks, what Kings have done ſince Chriſts time until now
for Chriſt? but even much againſt Chriſt &amp; true Chriſtians, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
that the firſt Chriſtian King in the world was he that ſubdued
this Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> to the profeſſion of the Goſpel; he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
what <hi>Conſtantine</hi> that Monarch did, in turning all the Empire,
the moſt of the world, from Paganiſme to Chriſtianity. I'le only
aske this queſtion of the Doctor, what glorious reformation in the
world was ever wrought without a Monarch? but the Dr. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
and tells us page 23. that there is divine reaſon, why States
ſhould incline to Democracy: one reaſon is; becauſe God did cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
us not Kings but people: take this reaſon of the Doctors one
way, it is ridiculous non-ſence: take it another way, it is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
untruth; for <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt man created by God, was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
a Monarch, God put all things under him to be ſubject and
ſerviceable to him; but his chief reaſon againſt Monarchy is; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
God hath ſetled his decree againſt Monarchy, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. Here
the Doctors jugling is diſcovered; for it is not Monarchy, but
degenerate Monarchy that God threatens to throw down: &amp; this
the Dr. doth as good as confeſs in page 32. where he confeſſeth
that the Monarchy of <hi>Nimrod</hi> was a degenerate Monarchy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
a tyrannical one: now to argue, becauſe God will overthrow
tyranical Monarchy, therefore he will overthrow all Monarchy,
holds no more true in the conſequence, then, becauſe God will
damn all reprobated men, therefore hee'l damn all men. Thus have
I given you a ſummary view of the chief things in the Doctors
Sermon; whereby it may plainly appear to every eye, that the
drift of this fellow (as of the reſt of his Jeſuited fraternity) is to
prove the Proteſtants of <hi>England,</hi> &amp; their civil Government to be
Antichriſtian, and that thoſe that have blowne up the lawful Parl.

a work, and honoured them withall, <hi>that they have bound Kings in

many Texts of prophetical Scripture to make good what he

ſaith he; what is good in the Doctors book, I ſhall make the beſt
and the trueſt uſe of, and what is evil and irrational, I ſhall diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it.</p>
            <p>As an introduction to this weighty buſineſs, I ſhall firſt diſcourſe
of Monarchy, which is ſo much cryed down by the Doctor. Firſt I
ſhal prove it to be <hi>Jure divino.</hi> Secondly, to continue in the Church
viſibly from <hi>Adam</hi> until Chriſt, except in a time of Gods extreme
wrath on the Church, when he ſeemed to deſtroy them. Thirdly,
that Monarchs have alwayes been the chief inſtruments by whom
God hath done the great and glorious things in the Church. I will
treat as briefly as may be on all theſe.</p>
            <p>1. Monarchy is <hi>Jure divino;</hi> becauſe God inſtituted it. He crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Adam,</hi> the Monarch of the whole world, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 28. he had do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over every living thing that moveth upon the earth; if any
ſhould ſay, except man: I do here affirm, that <hi>Adam</hi> had dominion
over man; for by the 5. Commandement, man was bound to ſubmit
unto him. If any ſhould ſay, that the form of Government was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by <hi>Adams</hi> fall. To that we anſwer, though the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inabled
him to perform exactly the duty of a Monarch, &amp; diſinabled
his poſterity to the exact performance of their duty; yet their fall
did not abſolve the one or the other from their duty: the Law
ſtood when <hi>Adam</hi> fell, and exacted as much from <hi>Adam</hi> and his
poſterity, after they fell, as before they fell, and they were as much
bound to fulfil the ſame after as before, otherwiſe there had been
no need of a Mediator: ſo that the Argument is ſtrong: What was
inſtituted by God, and never abrogated, is ſtill in force: that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
was ſucceſſive, is very clear; for <hi>Cain, Adams</hi> eldeſt Son, was
by Gods appointment to enjoy the dominion after his Father, <hi>Gen.</hi>
4. 7. for his well doing or evil doing God will reckon with him; not
<hi>Abel,</hi> though he were a real Saint, no, <hi>Abel</hi> muſt by Gods inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſubject to <hi>Cain; Cains</hi> wickedneſs could not excuſe <hi>Abels</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection;
nor <hi>Abels</hi> Saint-ſhip diſpoſſeſs his ungodly Brother: ſaith
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117866:8"/>
God to <hi>Cain,</hi> unto thee ſhall his deſire be ſubject, and thou ſhalt
rule over him, ſo <hi>Chryſoſtome de cauſam padius Calvine Ainſworth,</hi>
and many other learned men underſtand the Text, and ſo the <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint</hi>
tranſlates it: now if <hi>Abel,</hi> then <hi>Abels</hi> inferiors were to
ſubmit unto <hi>Cain,</hi> and ſo by conſequence, all the world after this
horrid breach in nature. God put a vaſt difference betwixt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſeed and <hi>Cains</hi> poſterity; for God raiſed out of <hi>Adams</hi> loines
a Monarch for the Church.</p>
            <p>2. This Monarchy we prove continued in the Church until
Chriſt: after <hi>Abels</hi> death God gave <hi>Adam</hi> a godly Son in his
ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

which implies thus much, that the Church of God were a people
then ſeparated from the world, from <hi>Cains</hi> wicked poſterity, who
ſoon run into Anarchy, out of which aroſe cruel tyranny.</p>
            <p>Theſe times were dark times, for we have very little either of
civil or eccleſiaſtick Hiſtory, until after the flood: therefore

this is manifeſt, that the Church was diſtinct from the world in
<hi>Seths</hi> Family: they were a community of themſelves, and 'tis moſt
probable, nay I think I may ſay amongſt Scholars, it is undeniable,
that Monarchical Government continued in <hi>Seths</hi> poſterity, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

from <hi>Samach</hi> to <hi>Noah:</hi> I humbly conceive (with ſubmiſſion to
better Judgeements) <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. is a cropologie of the Monarchs, that
ſucceeded in the Church before the Flood, at laſt the Church ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

out of which aroſe the monſtrous Tyrants, ſuch as <hi>Nimrod;</hi>

Teſtament and the new, <hi>(Heb.</hi> 7. tell us) he was <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Salem,</hi>
he was a King: ſo that we having proved Monarchy in the Church,
to be viſible from <hi>Adam</hi> till after the flood, I doubt not but by
Gods grace to make it more clearly appear from the flood until
Chriſt, except in the caſe of a national deſertion, when God for
their ſins forſook them, &amp; purpoſely as a deſigned judgment on the
Nation, threw down their Government, and made them extreamly
miſerable by taking away their Monarchs: Now this is ſo far from

Prieſts if they could not prove their Pedegree were to be
caſt out from being Prieſts; but theſe Prieſts were of the Order
of <hi>Aaron,</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Levi:</hi> this <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> is ſaid to be
without beginning of days, or end of life; perhaps, becauſe (as the
Doctor ſaith) he lived many years in both worlds, that is, in the
old before the flood, and in the new after the flood, <hi>Sem</hi> lived
fourſcore and 18. years in the old world, <hi>Cen.</hi> 11. 10. 11. and he
lived 600 years in the new world after the flood; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. gives
us a true Catalogue of the Monarchs in the Church before the
Church: ſo <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. gives us ſuch another Catalogue of thoſe who
lived after the flood unto <hi>Abraham: Shem</hi> had <hi>Elam</hi> and <hi>Aſher.</hi>
before the flood, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 22. but they were drowned in the flood,

               <hi>Nahor Terah,</hi> after <hi>Terah</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Abraham:</hi> here God only ſet
down the Monarchs in the Church; for every one of theſe had
more Sons then one 'tis probable, but they are not mentioned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were not the eldeſt Sons, they had not the priviledge
of the firſt-born, who by Gods Law, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 7. were to have the

<hi>Sems</hi> Family after the flood until <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With <hi>Abraham</hi> God made a Covenant, and promiſed to make
him a Nation, and a great Nation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 2. and that he would
give him the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and his ſeed ſhould poſſeſs it, and
multiply as the duſt of the earth, <hi>Gen. 13. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 16. This was a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
day of comfort to the poor Church, to hear of a bleſſed ſeed
that ſhall grow up to a great Nation, and be a bleſſing to all the
world; this promiſe did God renew to <hi>Abraham,</hi> after he parted
with <hi>Lot:</hi> this <hi>Abraham</hi> was both valiant and pious, as appears by
the redemption of his Kinſman <hi>Lot</hi> out of the hands of thoſe
Kings which took him captive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after which Victory <hi>Melchizedeck</hi>
met him, unto whom <hi>Abraham</hi> (as a King in homage to him, and
as a Prieſt in duty to him) paid Tythes: this <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
was <hi>Sem;</hi> for <hi>Sem</hi> was then living, and lived above 150. years
after this fight, ſo that it was <hi>Abrahams</hi> duty to pay Tythes to
<hi>Melchizedeck;</hi> for he was by right the abſolute Soveraign in the
Church, and in that reſpect without Father or Mother, that is,
without any ſuperior, and in that reſpect <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> was a type
of Chriſt; for Chriſt is abſolute Monarch of the Church, he is
without Father or Mother in that reſpect, he is ſubject to none.
But to the thing in hand: we ſee it is clear that Monarchy
and Religion have been continued in the Church together, from
<hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abraham:</hi> now from <hi>Abraham</hi> till Chriſt. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
continued in the Church: it is ſo viſible to every one that
reads the Scripture, that I will put it under the third Poſition
which I intend to treat briefly on, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:117866:9"/>
Thirdly, That the greateſt good that ever the Church of God received here
on earth from God, they received from the hands of Monarchs.</p>
            <p>The Scripture tells us of four glorious dayes that have been and ſhall be in
the world before the day of Judgement; three of theſe dayes are paſt, <hi>viz.</hi> The
day of Gods making known himſelf on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to his Church, in the
diſpenſation of his grace and love to his Church, in giving them Laws and
Ordinances for ſtanding rules of his Worſhip, untill the time of perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation:
<hi>Moſes</hi> the Monarch of the Church was the inſtrument of receiving
theſe Laws and Ordinances from God, and the inſtrument of divulging them
to the Church: <hi>Moſes</hi> was not only the Inſtrument of the greateſt deliverance
of the Church from the greateſt danger, but the Inſtrument of conveying the
greateſt good to them. That this <hi>Moſes</hi> was an abſolute Monarch, none will
deny that hath either wit or modeſty, for the twelve Tribes received the Law
at his mouth, and all matters of Judicature were determined by him, beyond
him there was no appeal; the people or the Elders did not chooſe him, but he
ordained Elders and ſet over the people; he was an abſolute Monarch, none
might ſpeak againſt him or reſiſt him; every Chriſtian that reads the Bible,
knows this to be a plain truth: he was the firſt Monarch that was over the
twelve Tribes and their families, which were many thouſands in number: this
<hi>Moſes</hi> God appointed to be the Ruler over theſe great people; he led them like
a flock of ſheep; no ſheepheard had more abſolute command over his flock,
then <hi>Moſes</hi> over the twelve Tribes. The Monarchs of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their infancie,
(whiles the Church was in Tabernacles) were called Judges; the removing of
theſe Monarchs was the greateſt Judgement that could befall the Church, and
and it was the greateſt mercy of God to reſtore them again. This <hi>Samuel</hi> in
reaſoning tells the people, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 8. God gave not <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
untill <hi>Iſrael</hi> cried unto the Lord: Ordinary prayers will not attain ſo
great a bleſſing to a nation as a godly Magiſtracy and Miniſtry, they muſt be
ſtrong cries to God that muſt obtain ſuch extraordinary mercies, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10.
the people provoked God by their Idolatry, and God threw down their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and made them ſerve their enemies; and then the people cried to the
Lord, and renewed their Covenant, then God ſent <hi>Gideon,</hi> ver. 11. he raiſed
him up to deliver them: God never took away Monarchy from <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but in
wrath for the peoples ſins; and God never reſtored it again, but he gave it as a
ſingular mercy, and ſign of his favour to them.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Ob.</hi> God gave them a King in his wrath, and he was angry with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for asking a King, God calls it a rejecting of him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> We anſwer briefly: 1. God gave not the Office of a King, but the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of a King in wrath. 2. He was angry at the peoples manner of asking a
King, for they asked not a King of <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribing, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
20. but a King like the Heathens that were Tyrants; well ſaith God, they
ſhall have ſuch a King that ſhall play the Tyrant amongſt them like the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Kings; therefore God bids <hi>Samuel</hi> ſhew them what manner of King God
will give them; this Tyrant God gave him for a ſcourge, yet no man, no not
<hi>David,</hi> though he were a Saint and an annointed Saint, durſt touch <hi>Sauls</hi> life;
though <hi>Saul</hi> were really a murtherer, a Tyrant, and a publike enemy; if <hi>Davids</hi>
heart ſmote him for cutting off <hi>Sauls</hi> skirt, O how would it have ſmote him had
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:117866:10"/>
he cut off his head! Monarchs are reſponſable for their actions to God: No
man on earth, much leſſe their ſubjects may judg or condemn them, but God
only; God took away this wicked King in his anger, as he ſet him up in
his wrath. 3. 'Tis manifeſt that God anointed <hi>David,</hi> and ſet him up King
over <hi>Iſrael</hi> of his own free will, and made a promiſe unto him (as unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham)</hi>
that his ſeed ſhould inherit the throne after him to many generations:
Now began the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to flouriſh now Kingly government was eſtabliſhed;
now, and not till now, had they perfect Conqueſt over all their enemies round
about; now the Ark was fetched home to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that had long lyen in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity.
And after <hi>David, Solomon</hi> built a moſt ſumptuous and rich Temple
unto God, he placed the Ark in it, where it remained in its reſting place; he
builded Altars, ordained Sacrifices, made the Sea, the golden Candleſticks, the
Trumpets and all the holy veſſels of gold and ſilver; he ordered the Prieſts, and
maintenance for the Prieſts, and the Singers, and the Porters; this was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
glorious day above others in the world; this day far exceeded <hi>Moſes</hi> his
day for beauty, and luſtre; but <hi>Moſes</hi> his day was the ſtand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng rule, all was writ by
<hi>Moſes</hi> his copy, though it was writ in a far fairer hand by <hi>Solomon:</hi> this day was
the noon-time of Reformation with the Saints under the old Teſtament, and
this day God made a Monarch to be the inſtrument of effecting it.</p>
            <p>The third glorious day in the world, which was the day of all dayes, was the
day of Chriſts coming in the fleſh to perfect a Reformation; he was <hi>(Luk. 3.)</hi>
a Monarch by ſucceſſion from <hi>Adam,</hi> and of the Royall family of <hi>Judah;</hi> he was
the mighty King long looked for and long before promiſed; he was and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the King of the Church, he made null and void all <hi>Moſes</hi> his Ceremoniall
ſhadows, he pulled down the Temple-worſhip, and ſet up Laws and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his own; never man ſpake or did like him; he was Monarch not only over
the ſouls of all men in the world, but is by right of ſucceſſion, conqueſt, and
compact with his Father, Monarch of the whole nations, of the bodies as well
as the ſouls of men: this Monarch hath gotten him a true right by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
as well as by his naturall prerogative, and therefore he truly may bear
that name and title which others uſurp, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
the King of Kings ruling over Kings: Chriſt is King of Kings and
Lord of Lords, he hath abſolute power over the bodies and ſouls of all men,
and expects obedience from them all; 'tis he that gives all the men in the
world protection, and gives them wealth and honours; he is never a jot the
leſſe King over the body, becauſe he is a ſpirituall King and King of the ſoul;
for as the rich man that commands the gold is maſter alſo of the cabinet that
holds it, ſo is Chriſt of the body which is but the cabinet of that precious
Jewel the ſoul: Chriſt refuſing to be made a King, and ſaying his Kingdom
was not of the world, deprived him not of his due, for he was born Monarch of
the world as deſcending from <hi>Adam,</hi> and King of the <hi>Jews</hi> as deſcending of
<hi>David;</hi> and when he was on earth he gave Laws to all the world both <hi>Jews</hi>
and Gentiles, to be obſerved on pain of damnation, herein he exerciſed the
power of a Monarch: This Monarch is in his being independent, and in his
power independent, he hath voluntary commands which he will have his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to obey though he give no reaſon for it.</p>
            <p>This independent power is only in him, no man is independent but only this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:117866:10"/>
mighty Monarch; and therefore the Proteſtants rightly call the Pope Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,
becauſe he makes himſelf abſolutely independent in his power, which is
to make himſelf equall with Chriſt; nay in this he ſets himſelf above Chriſt;
for Chriſt when he was on earth, ſubjected himſelf to the Scriptures, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
himſelf to the <hi>Jews</hi> to be tried by their own Prophets, whether he were
not the Chriſt; but the Pope uſurpes a power over the Scriptures; and herein
I may truly ſay, that Independency is the <hi>formalis ratio Antichriſti,</hi> becauſe it
ſets up man equall with Chriſt, yea above Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This Monarch, the Lord Jeſus ſet up new Laws, Statutes and Ordinances
in the world, the which we finde in the new Teſtament; this day was a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
day to the Gentiles, but through the <hi>Jews</hi> obſtinacy and unbelief was a
black diſmall day to them, for they pulled his blood on their heads to their
bane, which blood was appointed for their ſalvation.</p>
            <p>The rules that this Monarch gave from his own mouth, and the mouthes of
his Ambaſſadours the Apoſtles, are appointed for ſtanding rules unto the end
of the world, before which there is a fourth glorious day to come.</p>
            <p>This fourth day the Prophets have prophecied of, and Chriſt hath prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
of, and the Apoſtles have prophecied of, and eſpecially <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi>
had a ſight of; this day ſhall ſubſcribe in matter of fundamentals and
ſubſtantials to the day of Chriſts being on earth; but it ſhall as far exceed that
day in luſtre and in glorious effects, as <hi>Solomons</hi> day exceeded <hi>Moſes;</hi> and my
reaſons are, becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> and Gentiles ſhall be united this day in one faith;
and if Chriſts day of rejecting the <hi>Jews</hi> were the riches of the Gentiles, how
much more their fullneſſe. 2. There are more glorious promiſes made to this
day (in the Prophets) then any day; for this day now coming was the day that
the Prophets chiefly prophecied of, when they prophecied of a good day to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
and <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> 3. This day ſhall procure the deſtruction of the three
grand enemies of the Goſpel, the Dragon, the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet.
4. And all the Kingdoms in the world ſhall become Chriſts, which ſince the
Creation hath not yet been effected; of this day I am to treat. We have ſeen
the three other daies effected by Monarchs, this glorious day ſhall alſo be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by a Monarch ſo far as I can perceive; for it muſt be done by the riſing
of the ſlain Witneſſes, which is a lawfull Magiſtracy and a lawfull Miniſtry,
which we ſhall prove in the enſuing diſcourſe; where we ſhall treat of the
things immediatly preceding this great day; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The Witneſſes ſlaying,
and the Beaſts of the earth tyranny over the Saints. 2. We ſhall concur with
the Doctor in the time, and ſay, that in the end of this year 1650, or neer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
that time, this glorious day of the Witneſſes riſing and Antichriſts ruine
ſhall begin; but we ſhall abſolutely deny and diſown the Doctors ſigns of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts
fall; for he ſaith, That the beheading of the King, and the caſting off
the Lords, and the beating of the <hi>Scots,</hi> is the glorious beginning of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts
fall; and hereby is his text liberally fulfilled; herein we ſhall uncaſe
the Doctors weakneſſe or wilfull wickedneſſe, it may be both: The which I
will endeavour to do; by laying open the manifeſt truth as it lieth in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
many of which texts the Doctor quoteth.</p>
            <p>We are both agreed, that the time of Antichriſts fall ſhall be near 1650. this
preſent year or preſently after it, therefore wee'l paſſe that, both of us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:117866:11"/>
That the great day of Reformation is to begin this year, or within
twelve moneths of this year 1650. as the Doctor Learnedly proves in <hi>Pag.</hi>
15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p>But now the difference that will ariſe betwixt the Doctor and I, will be
about what ſhall be done in this great day.</p>
            <p>This I do affirm, yet not I but the Scriptures: 1. That the Witneſſes
ſhall ariſe in this day. 2. That the Dragon, the Beaſt and the falſe Prophet
ſhall be overcome in this day. 3. The Jews ſhall begin to be converted, both
the two Tribes and the ten Tribes, and all the Kingdoms in the world ſhall
become Chriſts. In the generall, as I have delivered them, I think the Doctor
and I do not much differ, unleſſe the Doctor differ from what he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
delivered, which is no ſtrange thing if he do.</p>
            <p>I affirm, That the glorious day of deſtroying the Beaſt and this falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and chaining the Dragon, and of the Jews converſion, ſhall be begun
when the Witneſſes ariſe from their ſlaying: Now this implies two things,
when the Witneſſes ariſe from their ſlaying: Now this implies two things,</p>
            <p>1. That the Witneſſes ſhall be ſlain immediatly before this day.</p>
            <p>2. That ſome enemy of the Church ſhall ſlay them.</p>
            <p>So that it will not be amiſſe to enquire, 1. Who ſlaies them; and 2. when
they are ſlain; we ſhall do both together exceeding briefly.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 7. and <hi>Daniel</hi> 7. 25. there is both; 1. The Beaſt that ſlaies
them, 2. The Witneſſes that are ſlain, and 3. the time when this ſhall be, in
<hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 7. when the Witneſſes have finiſhed their teſtimony, that is, when
their 1260 daies, <hi>(i.)</hi> years of propheſying in ſackcloth is out, <hi>v.</hi> 3. Then
the Beaſt aſcending (or that aſcendeth) out of the bottomleſs pit, ſhall make
warre with them, overcome them, and kill them. After three daies and an
half, <hi>(i.)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> three years and an half, theſe Witneſſes muſt riſe, <hi>v.</hi> 11. and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
after the ſeventh Trumpet ſoundeth, and then the Kingdoms of this
world became the Lords and his Chriſts, <hi>v.</hi> 15. This all men will grant is the
beginning of the great day of Reformation which immediatly follows upon
their riſing. And this is worth the noting alſo, <hi>v.</hi> 13. the ſame hour the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
enemies of the Church are ſlain, theſe men of name who are numbred
by their name, thoſe painted outſide Saints, but inſide devils, they ſhall fall,
and then, <hi>v.</hi> 19. the Temple of God is opened, and the vials are poured out,
this you have in <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. Now mark how that in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. anſwers to this:
<hi>Daniel</hi> in this chapter had a viſion of the four Monarchies, the <hi>Aſsyrian,</hi> the
<hi>Perſian,</hi> the <hi>Graecian,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy: After theſe four Monarchies
are extinguiſhed, Chriſt will ſet up his Monarchy, <hi>v. 18. The Saints of the
moſt high ſhall take the Kingdom and poſseſſe it for ever and ever,</hi> that is, untill the
day of Judgement: this is the beginning of the glorious day of Reformation,
which ſhall be when the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy ſhall be deſtroyed, which is the laſt
of the Kingdome or Monarchies; this is to be done at the ſounding of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
trumpet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 15. when all Nations and Kingdoms ſhall become
Chriſts: But mark how inquiſitive <hi>Daniel</hi> is, when he comes to the <hi>Roman</hi>
Monarchy, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 9. he would fain know the truth of this Beaſt and of the
ten Horns, and of the other (mark that) which came up after the ten Horns,
before whom three fell; even of that Horn that had eyes, and a mouth that
ſpake great things, whoſe look was more ſtout then his fellow, <hi>v. 20. I beheld
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117866:11"/>
and the ſame horn made warre with the Saints and prevatled againſt them:</hi> Here is
the Beaſt that ſlaies the Witneſſes, for 'tis one that riſeth in the end of the

Eſtates of King, Lords and Commons, who make the ſupream Power of the
Nation, where he uſurps this Power; but this queſtion is needleſſe, and
therefore we paſſe it by. The main thing we intend to prove by <hi>Daniel</hi> is,
That this Beaſt is he that ſlaies the Witneſſes, and the ſame with that in <hi>Rev.</hi>
11. 7. becauſe he is of the ſame time, for that in <hi>Daniel</hi> riſeth when the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>

the raign of Antichriſt is drawing to an end, which Antichriſt is the laſt
head of the Roman Monarchy the Pope: as this beaſt is of the ſame time, ſo
he doth the ſame things with that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 7. for there he makes war with
the Saints, prevails againſt them and ſlayes them: and in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 24. this
other little horn that riſeth after the ten Kings belonging to the Roman Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
this little horn that is an upſtart baſe fellow (ſay the Fathers) a

this horn muſt neceſſarily be ſome new upſtart fellow, who riſeth in the weſtern
Empire, diſtinct from other Kings; this horn ſhall ſpeak great words againſt
God, and ſhall wear out the Saints of the moſt high, and think to change
times and Laws. Theſe words need no comment, ſince the times we live in are

            <p>But this that makes it moſt cleer of all other, is that which immediatly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows

the Judgement ſhall ſit, and they ſhall take away his dominion, to conſume

pit: this bottomleſſe pit is Independencie, I will prove it can be nothing elſe.
<hi>Aleazar</hi> and many other learned men do not take bottomleſſe pit to be
meant hell, but ſome ſay it is meant confuſion, and others the ſea, but
I affirm that 'tis meant Independencie, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 1. When the fifth An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
ſounded, there fell a Starre from Heaven, that is, a Biſhop from the
true Church, to the earth, from a Paſtor to become a Prince, from Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick
affairs to Civil ſtate affairs, and to him was given the key of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe
pit. The Pope was the firſt that unlocked the door of Independencie:
Mark it, and it will appear that Independencie is the <hi>formilis ratio Antichristi;</hi>
for untill the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> got to be Independent in reſpect of the
Emperour his Lord and Sover<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ign, and Independent as relating to the
Councels, he was not Antichriſt, but herein in his exalting himſelf by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependencie
above all Magiſtracy, which is called God in Scripture, in making
himſelf Independent, he made himſelf Antichriſt; for reduce the Pope but to
his due obedience to the Roman Emperour whoſe power he uſurps, and
to Counſels to bring him under their cenſure, and the Pope will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to his primitive inſtitution, that is, to an honeſt plain Paſtor, which
is all his due, and all that the primitive Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were. The Pope
had the key of Independencie, for by making the Dukes of <hi>Italy</hi> free
States <hi>(i.e.)</hi> Independent as to the Emperor; he ſhut the Emperor
out of <hi>Italy</hi> his proper dominion, and thus as he continues Independent he
continues Antichriſt; who ſitting in the ſeat of God, exalts himſelf above
God, for he ſaith he is Independent as to the holy Scriptures, and that the
Scripture is dependent upon him, and herein he exalts himſelf above God: by
this power of Independencie, the Pope let into the world all manner of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
hereſie and profaneſſe: by the Power of Independencie the Pope drove a
godly Magiſtracy and Miniſtry into the wilderneſſe for 1260 years: and now
by this laſt beaſt riſing out of Independencie and ſetting up Indepencie, I ſay
by that Independent beaſt, the Witneſſes, the Magiſtracy and Miniſtry that
had finiſhed their teſtimony, that is, had finiſhed their Directory, cleared and
vindicated their Doctrines, and had agreed to caſt out Independencie and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
out of the three Kingdoms, even then, when they had finiſhed their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
this beaſt breaks them in peeces by making war againſt them, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them; thus you have the Witneſſes ſlaying, and the Beaſt that ſlayes them
immediatly before the glorious day of Reformation in the world.</p>
            <p>A further deſcription you have of this Beaſt, by his Government that he
ſets up, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 11, 12, and 18. and in <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 36, 37, 38.</p>
            <p>You have heard already when he riſeth, 'tis in the end of the Roman Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
when the 1260 years, of the Popes raign draws towards an end; and
you have heard out of what this Beaſt that ſlayes the Witneſſes ariſeth, 'tis out
of Independencie; for mark it, as Antichriſt the Pope aroſe by the key of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependencie,
out of the pureſt Church <hi>(viz)</hi> the Roman Church, and drove
the Witneſſes (which undoubtedly are the Magiſtracy and Miniſtry) into the
wilderneſſe, ſo this Beaſt riſeth out of Independencie, riſing out of the bowels
of the pureſt reformed weſtern Church, and ſlay theſe Witneſſes who had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
their teſtimony againſt Antichriſt: the nature of Independencie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
men is to deſtroy Magiſtracy and Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>But that you may know this Beaſt more diſtſtinctly, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 11, 12, 18.

               <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>John</hi> are in the diſcovering of this Beaſt and his actings, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.

then out of the earth, to ſhew alſo that he is not the ſame with the Beaſt of

this Beaſt of the earth (ſaith he) is <hi>Rex octavus, &amp; incipit quando
prima beſtia deſtinet, &amp; incipit cum bestia aſcendit ex abyſſo,</hi> he is the eighth
King (meaning that <hi>

the Sea) goeth out, and he begins when the Beaſt ariſeth out of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe

King, <hi>(Rev. 17. 11.)</hi> and the Beaſt ariſing out of the bottomleſſe pit one and
the ſame beaſt, only the one text ſets out his riſing, the other his raigning,
and the other his ruin: Firſt, He ariſeth out of the earth; which notes to us
that he is a Lay man, for earth is here put as contradiſtinct to ſea; to note, that
as he that drives the Witneſſes into ſackcloth riſeth out of the Clergy in
the Roman Church, (for <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 1. he uſurpt the throne with ſeaven
heads and ten horns, that is the Roman Emperiall ſeate,) ſo the beaſt that
ſlay the Witneſſes (though he riſe by Independency as the Pope did) yet he
ſhall be a Lay man, no Clergy man, but a Layick. Secondly, Or by earth
may be meant (as oft it is in Scripture) a mean and low condition; to
note, that this <hi>terrae filius</hi> that ſlayes the Witneſſes, ſhall be a fellow of low
diſcent: This well agrees with <hi>Daniels</hi> expreſſion of the ſame Beaſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 8.
he calls him a little horn, <hi>Cornu parvulum quia in principio nullius momenti repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabitur
in occulis Regum terrae,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hugo Cardinalis,</hi> he is a little horn, becauſe
in his beginning he ſhall be of no eſteem or repute amongſt the Kings of the
earth; he ſhall not ariſe out of any Kingly ſtock, but out of ſome obſcure,
private, broken family: This Beaſt of the Earth is therefore called <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 21.
a vilde Fellow, I confeſſe this more immediatly belongs (as ſay interpreters)

imboldens me, whoſe opinion is that the likeneſſe of things acted in
the end of the Macedonian Empire (immediatly before the coming of Chriſt)
to the things to be acted in the end of the Roman Monarchy (before the great
day of Chriſts coming to convert Jews and Gentiles) made <hi>Daniel</hi> to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
both under one expreſſion: this is very probable, for (as the Rabbins
ſay) an Iota of Scripture hath a mountain of ſenſe depending on it; mark
therefore how in the end of the Roman Monarchy, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 21. a vile fellow
ſhall ſtand up, he is an upſtart, an uſurper, he ſhall not have the honour of the
Kingdom given him, but he ſhall come in peaceably, and obtain the Kingdom
by flattery. Mark how he gets to his Kingdom, not by open force, but
by pretences of peace to ſettle the Kingdom in peace; this Party muſt be
disbanded, and the other Party thruſt out of the Kingdom, and another Party
muſt be ſupplanted, and all under pretence of Peace; the King muſt be taken
off, and the Nobles degraded, and the Commons ſecluded, and all for the
ſettling of peace; his motto is <hi>Pax quaeritur bello,</hi> I have read it in his Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dart,
all his pretences are peace and reſtoring the Free-born people to their
Liberties. Two things diſcover him clearly; Firſt he ſucceeds in the room
of a King which is deſtroyed, neither in wroth, nor battel, <hi>v.</hi> 20. how then,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117866:13"/>
if neither by wroth nor battel, then certainly he muſt be deſtroyed by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
act of pretended Juſtice againſt him, and ſo deſtroyed by cutting off
his head as a malefactor. Now that King ſo deſtroyed, this vile fellow muſt
ſucceed. Nay <hi>v.</hi> 22. he ſhall proceed to overthrow the Prince of the Covenant:
Now we ſee how it hath ſucceeded with the Covenant-keeping Party at the
ſtern of government. The like Paraphraſe may run in the following verſes, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out this beaſts deſignes againſt the King of the South; but I will not be
too bold, ſince the times are comments on theſe texts: let this be ſufficient to
make us know, that the Beaſt of the earth, and the little horn, and this vile
fellow, are none and the ſame Beaſt, even he that ſlayes the Witneſſes; and his
two horns, and his Dragons tongue, are but to ſet forth his hypocriticall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences;
as the Serpents tongue beguiled <hi>Eve,</hi> ſo this fellow beguiles innocent
perſons to their ruin. His two horns ſignifie his power, his Army, they are like
Lambs horns: <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 12. 'tis not ſaid, the horns of the Lamb, but horns like a
Lamb, that is harmleſſe: he pretends that his Army ſhall lay down Arms
whenſoever the Parliament will command them; they are Conſcientious
men, who profeſſe its againſt their Principles to fight, but to ſuffer for their
Religion: This Beaſts Army are all innocent Doves, and harmleſſe Lambs,
all Saints, perſecuted Saints forſooth, that count all men bitter-ſpirited men
that beleeve not every word they ſay; but he hath the tongue of a Dragon:
It alludes to the Serpent in Paradice that deceived <hi>Eve,</hi> and ſo overthrew <hi>Adam</hi>
the only Monarch of the world. So doth this Beaſt with his Lambs horns,
through his lying, cheating, ſwearing, forſwearing, and cheating of effeminate
ſilly people, overthrow the only true Chriſtian Monarch in the world; (I
wiſh it be not proved, that they have had a hand in <hi>Adams</hi> ruin, through the
ſubtilty of Jeſuits thoſe Chriſtian-State Serpents:) therefore this horn is ſaid
to have, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 8. the eyes of a man, that is, aboundance of humane policy,
ſaith <hi>Theodoret,</hi> and much diſſimulation, ſaith <hi>Maldonatus:</hi> and then he ſpeaks
like the Dragon, that's another note of this beaſt; like unto which you have
that <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 8. he hath a mouth ſpeaking great things: obſerve, this beaſt hath
not the Teeth, nor the Tayl, nor the Sting, but the Tongue of the Dragon;
ſo that <hi>Fabritius Hectors</hi> comment on thoſe words, ſeemeth to me very good
<hi>Os loquens injentia</hi> (i.e.) <hi>eloquens, Superbus, malledicus; jactabundus, fallax &amp;

of boaſting, a deceitfull fellow, and a threatner, and he arrogates divinity to

that which acted immediately before him, and that muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

in the ſame 13. Chapter, verſe 21. This is none other but the
<hi>Pope:</hi> now he doth all that the firſt Beaſt could do in the ſight of
him, that is, in the preſence or ſight, or with the approbation of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> he exerciſeth his power. Now what power hath the <hi>Pope?</hi>
ſurely none at all; but what's uſurped, the <hi>Pope</hi> is called the firſt
Beaſt, in regard of this laſt Beaſt of the earth: he is called the firſt,
becauſe he is the firſt great enemy of the Church, within the
Church: the Heathen Emperors were Rulers over the Church,
but they were without the Church; but the Pope is the great ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the Church within the Church now profeſſing Chriſt: he
was the firſt that drove the witneſſes into the Wilderneſs, and
made them wear Sack<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cloth: now the laſt Beaſt that ſlayes the
witneſſes, which is the Beaſt we are here treating of, is he that gets
up into his power by exerciſing the power of the firſt Beaſt (that is)
the Pope: now it is well known, that the <hi>Popes</hi> exerciſe no power
but what is uſurped, they got their power by their diſſembling and

            <p>And he cauſeth the earth and them that dwell therein, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
the firſt Beaſt, whoſe deadly wound was healed, here is his

in relation to the precedent matter, which altogether treated of
the firſt Beaſt that ſhould riſe within the Church, to make the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt
which were <hi>Popes,</hi> now theſe words [whoſe deadly wound

In <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. he ſets up a Government of his own forcing

            <p>There is one notable place more in <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 45. which points at
time and the place of the ruine of the Beaſt. This Beaſt of the
earth or this King, (as <hi>Daniel</hi> calls him) ſhall plant the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles
of his pallace, between the Seas in the glorious holy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
yet he ſhall come to his end, and none ſhall help him: this
holy Mountain, learned men on all ſides conclude, is ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Kingdom for holineſs: therefore the Independent Pulpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
ſay, 'tis <hi>England,</hi> this day eminent in exalting the Saints and
holineſs; certainly, 'tis that Kingdom which hath kept its Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
clean from ſpiritual fornication, and hath not received the
marks of the Beaſt, nor bowed down to his Image, that is, engaged
to be true and faithful to his unlawful new Government. And of
all the Kingdoms in the world, I think it is <hi>Scotland,</hi> where the Beaſt
of the earth hath placed his Tabernacles, where he now is, &amp; where
I believe he ſhall come to ruine. But mark what imediately follows
this, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 1. And at that time ſhall <hi>Michael</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſtand up,
and it ſhall be a time of trouble, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. and <hi>Luke</hi> 21. And
at that time the elect ſhal be all delivered, that is as much to ſay, as
all the Kingdoms in the world ſhall become Chriſts, both Jews
and Gentiles ſhall be brought to Chriſt: this glorious day is in
ſeveral places called a day of Reſurrection, it ſhall be to the Jews
as a day of Reſurrection: now all this is to be at the 7. Trumpet
ſounding; and therefore the ruine of <hi>Daniels</hi> Beaſt and <hi>Johns</hi> Beaſt
are at one and the ſame time; and therefore 'tis but one and the
ſame Beaſt that they both mention. As for thoſe that affirm this
Beaſt is <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who raigned in the time of the <hi>Grecian Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi>
&amp; was deſtroyed before the <hi>Roman Monarchy</hi> was in being:
it is ſo wide from the Text, that 'tis impoſſible to be true; for
this little horn ariſeth not only after the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy, but
after the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy became ten horned: he riſeth the laſt
diſtinct from them all; and therefore I will ſay to ſuch men, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi>

actions, and the ruine of the Beaſt, to be one and the ſame both in
<hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Revelation.</hi> But that we may not be miſtaken in
this beaſt of the earth, take a more exact view of this beaſt, as the
Holy Ghoſt deſcribes him in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 13. And he doth great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
for that he made fire come down from Heaven on the earth,
in the ſight of men, and deceived them that dwell on the earth, by
the ſigns which were permitted him to do in the ſight of the beaſt,
ſaying to them that dwell on the earth, that they ſhould make an

and to that the Holy Ghoſt alludes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 20. I will intreat the
Reader to obſerve, how this beaſt of the earth gets to his power, in

elſe but Independency: then up-ſtarts this beaſt of the earth, who
ariſeth out of the pureſt Church, and out of the pureſt part of the
Church; he is one that profeſſeth piety beyond all others, one
that holds all the principles of Religion to be true, that cries out
againſt <hi>Antichriſt</hi> more then any. As the Popes by pretending the
advancement of Chriſt, and <hi>Peters</hi> chair, advanced themſelves to
that exceſſive pride and tyranny over Church &amp; State: ſo doth the
beaſt of the earth by his pious pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ences of ſetting up Chriſt, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
his own wicked deſigns, and ſlayes the witneſſes. As the beaſt
of the Sea aroſe out of the Church, where the famouſeſt witneſſes,
<hi>viz.</hi> Magiſtracy and Miniſtry were, and drove them into Sack-cloth
and into the wilderneſs, that is, into ſome remote Kingdom in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
where they remain 1260. years: ſo muſt the beaſt of the earth
in this wilderneſs, ariſe amongſt the witneſſes where they are finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their teſtimony, and there he muſt kill them: therefore when
<hi>John</hi> comes to ſee the judgement of the whore, he was carried into
the wilderneſs, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> that remote Countrey, whither the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
by the beaſt of the Sea were driven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 3. But this place
only in the world is <hi>England;</hi> for here only a lawful Magiſtracy
and Miniſtry hath for 1200. years been viſible in Sack-cloth: ſo
that you muſt expect this laſt enemy of the Church to be more
cunning, cruel, and ſubtil to deceive, then any that ever were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him; for he hath all the politick tricks of <hi>Rome,</hi> he doth all
that the firſt beaſt could do before him, did the <hi>Pope</hi> fall from his
firſt principles, ſo doth he, did the <hi>Pope</hi> depoſe and murther, and
rebel agoinſt his liege Maſter the Emperor? ſo doth he againſt his
Soveraign; did the <hi>Pope</hi> perſecute the Miniſters that would not
comply with his deſigns? ſo doth this beaſt. Did the <hi>Pope</hi> impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
and ridiculouſly profeſs to the world, that all his Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
murthering of Emperors and Kings, and depoſing of them,
was for the promotion of the Goſpel, and the good of the Church?
even ſo doth this beaſt. So that he doth all that the firſt beaſt could
do before him, yea and more too; for he doth greater wonders,
he maketh fire to come down from Heaven on the earth, in the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:117866:19"/>
ſight of men: this is one of his great ſignes whereby he deceives
people. Obſerve this, his pretences and deſigns are on purpoſe to
deceive the people, and he deceives the people mearly to ſet up his
new Government, he ſets it up by his doing wonders: this is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
Character of a cheater, and the <hi>Antichriſt</hi> to prove his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
by his ſignes and wonders. That power is an uſurped power,
that hath no other title then ſignes and wonders to maintain it.
'Tis an <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> power the Holy Ghoſt tells us: for <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi>
comes with lying wonders, 2<hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. I omit to repeat the
ſeveral ſtrange opinions of both Proteſtants and Papiſts,
upon theſe words, [and he maketh fire come down

becauſe I poſſibly may do that hereafter. At this time I
ſhall only deliver the ſoundeſt and moſt cleareſt opinions.
<hi>Brocard</hi> comes neareſt the mark of any <hi>Engliſhman;</hi> for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives,
it alludes to 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 10. where <hi>Elias</hi> proved himſelf to
be a man of God, by cauſing fire to come down, and conſume
thoſe that came againſt him: his alluſion is good, had he rightly
applyed it; for this beaſt of the earth pretends to be by his good
ſucceſs, as prevalent with God, to deſtroy thoſe that were againſt
him, as <hi>Elias</hi> was. But <hi>Cornelius, è lapide</hi> comes nearer the mark:
for he conceives this expreſſion of fire coming from heaven, alludes
to that in the 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 1. where <hi>Solomon</hi> ſacrificed in the ſight
of all the people (after he had made his publick prayer, in the
ſight of all the people) had by fire coming down from heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his ſacrifice, an unqueſtionable evidence of Gods accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of his prayers. This alluſion is alſo good: for this beaſt of the
earth, pretends to be the only man to build Gods houſe; and for
that end makes a glorious profeſſion, and proclaims Faſts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
(as if indued with <hi>Solomons</hi> ſpirit, he makes publick prayers unto
God to bleſſe him in his undertakings for him, and his cauſe: after
which he proceeds to act the higheſt murther, treaſon and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and ſucceeding well in it, he c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>yes out to the people, behold
providence, behold a return of prayers; we faſted yeſterday and
to day, we have had ſucceſs, this is the fire which comes down;
but obſerve it, 'tis in the original, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, be made fire.
Obſerve that, 'tis fire of his own making: he plotted the deſign,
and then faſted, he conveies the fire under his own ſacrifice, 'tis
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:117866:19"/>
falſe fires that he makes. I conceive, it alludes to that in 1 <hi>Kings</hi>
18. 36. 38. where <hi>Elias</hi> that eminent Servant of God, proved
himſelf to be a true Prophet, and all the reſt to be but Baalls Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
by the fire which God ſent from Heaven on the earth in
the ſight of men: ſo doth this Beaſt of the earth endeavour by his
ſignes to prove himſelf as prevalent with God as <hi>Elias,</hi> and as
true ſincere a worſhipper of God as <hi>Elias,</hi> and all that oppoſe him,
or croſſe his deſigns, to be put Baalls Prieſts: and thus he proves
it, I faſt ſaith he, and my enemies faſt: they faſt to preſerve the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Government, I faſt to throwe it down, after I have faſted I
prevail; but though my enemies faſt, God hears them not: they
have no fire comes near their ſacrifice, though they cry and weep
day and night; but ſo ſoone as I faſt, the things I faſt for is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
accompliſhed; and this his ſucceſs in this audacious villainy,
murther, &amp; rebellion againſt Gods Law, natures Law, and his own
ſolemn Vows and Covenants, he makes the ſilly people believe is
the return of his prayers, the fire of Gods ſending from heaven
upon his ſacrifice. This notes, that this Beaſt in his ſlaying of the
witneſſes, ſhall pretend to act eminently for Chriſt, and make the
world believe he is an eminent Saint, and that all the godly faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Miniſters are but <hi>Baalls</hi> Prieſts, (as they are now termed) to
him. But obſerve the next verſe, v. 14. And be deceived them that
dwell on the earth: he for all his ſignes is but a cheater, therefore
he is called, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 20. the falſe Prophet. He pretends to be ſuch
as <hi>Elias,</hi> who was a true Prophet; but he is a falſe Prophet, and
only cheats the people: therefore <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 24. he is ſaid with
his company of ſeducers like himſelf, to ſeduce, if it were poſible,
the very Elect; and for this end, he cheats them, to ſubmit to his
Government, which he hath ſet up by the power of his ſword,
that's the meaning of theſe words (ſaying to them that dwell on
the earth, that they ſhould make an Image of the Beaſt which was
wounded with the ſword and did live.) This is the end of all his
pretences and pious acts, it is to ſubject the people to that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
which he ſets up: he faſts and prayes, and humbles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
but 'tis to cheat the people, and all this he doth in the ſight
of the Beaſt, (that is) the Pope, for there is no other beaſt in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but the Pope, that the Holy Ghoſt intends: now to do it in
the ſight of the Beaſt, (ſaith the <hi>Roman</hi> Gloſſary) is to do it with
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:117866:20"/>
the beaſts good liking; ſo that what he doth the Pope approves
of, and likes well of. Indeed I believe the Pope will never frown
at the beheading of a Proteſtant King, and blowing up of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Parliament, who reſolved and were agreed to unhorſe his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſurped holineſs power in the three Kingdoms. The Pope cannot
but look on with great content, yea, and triumph in this year of
<hi>Jubilee,</hi> which falls out according to the Propheſie, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 10.
when they give thanks for the removing of the witneſſes, it ſhall
be a year of rejoycing with the enemy, to ſee a King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
utterly broken, who covenanted to break <hi>Rome;</hi> and to ſee an
Aſſembly of Divines battered and broken, and their labor in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
utterly fruſtrated, this cannot but rejoyce the Pope and
his Conclave. What? To have that accompliſhed now, which <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
Faux, Catesby, Winter,</hi> and <hi>Garnet,</hi> and all thoſe Gunpowder-Saints
could never accompliſh, to have it now accompliſhed by his
new canonized Saints? This cannot but be well liking to the
Pope. V. 15. And it was given to him, to give life to
the Image of the beaſt, that the Image of the beaſt,
ſhould ſpeak, and ſhould cauſe, that whoſoever would not
adore the Image of the beaſt, ſhould be ſlain. This Image of the
beaſt hath alluſion either to that Image which <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> ſet
up in the plain of <hi>Dura,</hi> enjoyning all men upon pain of death to
fall down and worſhip it; which the conſciencious godly Jews re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing,

but when the Souldiers had bound the three conſcienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

behold, they that threw them into the fire were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
and the poor Saints ſtood upon their feet, Chriſt appears
amongſt them in the Furnace, forthwith they are releaſed; and
immediately after, all the Kingdoms in the world are made to

of Trumpet: ſo ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

King there is ſaid to honour the God <hi>Mauzzim,</hi> that is, a ſword-power.
And this Image here is the ſame: for 'tis a ſword-power,
ſuch as <hi>Ceſar</hi> erected by the ſword, and ſupported by the ſword,
until he had compleated his Conqueſts. There in <hi>Daniel</hi> he makes
his God <hi>Mauzzim</hi> to rule over many, and here in the <hi>Revelation</hi>
he cauſeth, that as many as will not ſubmit to this Image of the
beaſt, ſhould be killed: I conceive that theſe two Texts agree
with each other.</p>
            <p>And it was given him. Obſerve, this beaſt is one ſingle
perſon that ſets up this Image. I am very prone to believe, that
the Image that this beaſt ſets up, is that mentioned in <hi>Revel.</hi> 17.
12. And the ten horns which thou ſaweſt, are ten Kings, which yet
have received no Kingdoms, but receive power as Kings one hour
with the beaſt. 'Tis abſurd to ſay, theſe ten Kings are the ten
Kings under the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, which denominate <hi>Rome</hi> the
beaſt (as they ſay) with ten horns.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe the ten Kings ſubject to <hi>Rome,</hi> they were diſtinct
Kingdoms; but theſe ten here mentioned, have no Kingdoms, nor
any Crowns on their head.</p>
            <p>2. Neither are they real Kings, they only have <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
power as Kings, they write, (we inact, and be it inacted) as if
they were Kings; but they are not really Kings.</p>
            <p>3. Theſe riſe and reign with the beaſt, which beaſt cannot be
meant the <hi>Pope;</hi> for v. 1. the whore is the <hi>Pontifick</hi> ſtate that ſits on

red with blood; therefore they are called the red Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,
Chap. 12. 3. he is full of names of blaſphemy; becauſe he is the
tolerator and ſupporter of blaſphemies: he hath ſeven heads and
ten hornes, becauſe he beares up <hi>Rome</hi> with 7. heads and 10. horns.
<hi>Rome</hi> had fallen by the hands of the witneſſes, had not he ſlaine
them v. 7. This beaſt bears up the woman with 7. heads and 10.
horns, v. 8. The beaſt is called, he that was and is not, and aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out of the bottomleſs pit: this can be no other but that beaſt
that ſlayes the witneſſes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 7. This beaſt v. 11. is called the

be careful to avoid one miſtake, that is, not to take theſe 10. horns,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 16. for the ſame perſons v. 12. but only the ſame Office in
diſtinct parties hands: this is clear; for thoſe v. 12. riſe and fall with
the beaſt; but thoſe v. 16. give their Kingdom to the beaſt: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they had a Kingdom before the beaſt was in being. 2. Thoſe in
v. 12. go to reign with the beaſt; but theſe v. 16. bring the Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cality
to ruine. Thoſe in v. 12. are that faction that the beaſt ſets

of Kings, who have voted themſelves the ſupreme power of the
Kingdom, <hi>hi decem Reges erunt tempore Antichriſti, unde dicuntur

the time of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> he means this beaſt of the earth: therefore
they are ſaid not as yet to have received power, and they receive
power one hour <hi>(i. e.)</hi> a very ſhort time) <hi>cum beſtia</hi> (ſaith <hi>E. lapide)
quia beſtia primariam habet poteſtatem, Reges autem abea ſunt ſecundi</hi>
becauſe the beaſt hath the chief power, but the Kings
have but a ſecundary power from them. The beaſt may
well have the primarypower; for by his ſword-power they
were ſet up, and upheld by it; ſo that it is evident,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:117866:21"/>
who the beaſt is, and what the Image of the beaſt is: his giving
life to the Image is by putting Authority into their hands, to act
and inforce the people to ſubject to their Taxes, edicts, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and to out-law every man that will not engage to be true
and faithful to them.</p>
            <p>Thus the Reader may perceive who this beaſt is, and what kind
of Government he ſets up, and the tyranny and cruelty of this
beaſts Government when 'tis ſet up. Before it was ſet up, they
pleaded nothing but liberty for tender Conſciences, they ſhewed
nothing but the horns of a Lambe, and the tongue of a Dragon,
ſpeaking ſmoothly, pleading for brotherly love, and tender bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
over the Saints, until they were got into the Throne, and then
nothing but treaſon and high treaſon, to be laid to their charge,
who ſhould dare to queſtion any of their actions, or not ſubject to
their power ſo as to ſubſcribe to be true and faithful to it: thus
you may perceive his Government in the form of it.</p>
            <p>Now followes the Subjects of this new Government, v. 16. <hi>And
he made all, both ſmall and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

            <p>Their manner of ſubjection is ſet forth by giving a marke. I am
inforced here to vindicate the Text, not in the Copy, for I find no

erected) the kind of worſhip and ſubjection that people ſhall
be inforced to give to it. Other Kings make their Subjects ſweare

therefore when this beaſt appears. <hi>John</hi> uſhers him in with this
phraſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. v. 10. here is the patience and the faith of the
Saints. And in chap. 14. &amp; 10. 11. 12. a place worth obſerving,
becauſe miſuſed by moſt Expoſitors. There the Miniſters forewarn
the people not to bow down to ſuch a Government, nor to own
the beaſts authority, v. 10, 11. upon pain of damnation, v. 12.
here is the patience of the Saints: here are they that keep the
Commandements of God, and the faith of Jeſus. The Holy Ghoſt
ſeemeth to bring in the words abruptly, to note, that when this
new Government of the beaſt comes upon the Stage, the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
faith, and ſincereity of the Saints will be ſhaken and tryed: the
blaſt of perſecution that this beaſt raiſeth againſt the Saints will
be ſuch, as will blow off the Periwigs of profeſſion from Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:117866:23"/>
Bald-pates: you ſhall know a ſincere godly Saint by the
badge of perſecution, by his patience under afflictions, and his
ſteadfaſt faith which no perſecution can once move, and by his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
and keeping Gods Commandements, keeping both Tables,
neither proving Rebel to God, nor to his lawful Magiſtrate: Here
are they that keep the Commandements. But marke what follows,
v. 13. <hi>Bleſſed are the Dead which die in the Lord:</hi> either 'tis meant
that they are bleſſed that die in Chriſt, becauſe freed from the ſad
calamities of theſe times, or elſe they are bleſſed that die for

excellent: for they reſt from their labor in a Reformation; and
that Reformation which they toiled and laboured for, ſo ſoone as
they are gone, follows them: that covenanted Reformation imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
followes the ſlain witneſſes. For the next verſe 14. <hi>Chriſt
appeares in a white Cloud,</hi> (the ſame with <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 31. and <hi>Revel.
10. 1.)</hi> 'tis the effect of the 7th. Trumpet, after which the vine of
the earth is reaped, and the blood of him and his Company is ſhed
in a dreadful manner: the ſame with <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. where 7000 men
of name are ſlain, and the ſame with that 3. <hi>Habacuk</hi> 4. 5. 6. where
we find horns coming out of Chriſts hands, that is, power in his
hands, he goeth forth with terrible judgements to meaſure the
earth. But more of this anon. We ſee the time when this Image is
ſet up, is the time of the witneſſes ſlaying, 'tis a time of miſerable
perſecution, which is ſet out by not buying and ſelling; a thing
that every man ought by the Law of nature to afford his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and is bound to perform to all men; but this
beaſt takes away the Saints maintenance, their Offices, their
dignities, their livelihoods, and their lives, he hangs
up whole Families, as it were in Gibbets: this beaſt as he
is the cunningſt, ſo the cruelleſt to the poor Saints: therefore
ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Mat. 24. except theſe dayes ſhould be ſhortned, no fleſh
[then] living ſhould be ſaved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that is, with a temporal ſalvation;
but that God for the Elects-ſake, which cry to him day and night,
will ſhorten theſe dayes. This beaſt would devour the fleſh of all
the Saints, for he ſuffers none to buy or ſell, ſave he that had the
mark, or the name of the beaſt, or the number of his name. In v.
16. there they that ſubject give the marke; and in this verſe they
muſt have the mark, that is, a Certificate that they have ſubſcribed,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:117866:23"/>
or elſe he ſhall have no audience in their Courts, nor egreſs and
regreſs at their Garriſons, he ſhall not paſſe the Countrey from
City to City, without this Certificate: this marke muſt be a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription;
for how elſe can it be conceived, that they ſhould give
the markes, and have the marke? I hope the Reader will pardon
me, if for brevity ſake I pick not up their Arrowes, which ſhoot
wide at this mark. <hi>Viega,</hi> conceives, the marke, the name, and the
number of the name, are three diſtinct Characters of this
beaſt.</p>
            <p>1. He thinks 'tis the frame of <hi>Antichriſts</hi> Government to the
life. If <hi>Viega</hi> meane, in policy; I think he is right: for this beaſt is
like the <hi>Pope</hi> in his politick deviliſh deſigns: hee'l lie and cheat, and
ſupplant, and flatter, and forſwear, and murther, and yet pretend
fair like the <hi>Pope:</hi> therefore he doth all in the ſight of the <hi>Pope,</hi>
and <hi>Revel.</hi> 17 He is of the ſeven.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Viega</hi> conceives he hath a name written in plain Letters,
whereby he may be known. This I have much adoe to believe, yet
wee'l give the <hi>Jeſuite</hi> fair play, and (if that will content him)
wee'l ſhew him one whoſe numeral letters in his name, conteine
the full meaſure of time alotted him by the Holy Ghoſt, which in
<hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 25. is three years and an half<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now that makes forty &amp; two
moneths, and 1260 dayes: ſo many years is alotted to the <hi>Pope</hi> to
raign, as to this beaſt of the earth there is dayes alotted. The <hi>Pope</hi>
keeps the witneſſes in <hi>Sackcloth</hi> 1260 years, &amp; this beaſt ſlayes the
witneſſes, &amp; raigns 3. years &amp; a half, which makes 1260 dayes: this

upſtarts this <hi>Antichriſt</hi> this witneſs-ſlayer, and he raigns but ſo
many dayes as the <hi>Pope</hi> raigns years, which is 1260 dayes, which

            <p>But above all, give me Mr. <hi>Thomas Goodwin,</hi> a <hi>Cambridge-man,</hi>
now head of a Colledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi> he ſpeaks in his Manuſcript
(which he ſaid the times would not then bear, when he writ it)
upon the <hi>Revelation,</hi> chap. 13. v. 17. by number he underſtands,
a Company taking part with <hi>Antichrist</hi> in a more remote kind of
ſubjection: and then a little after that, he tells us, that the name of
this beaſt is to be found out in <hi>Europe,</hi> where the Company is that
powres out the Vials on the beaſt: and farther he ſaith, that his
name is to be found amongſt thoſe in theſe Kingdoms that receive
the name: by the number of his name he underſtands, ſuch as do
hold and bring in ſuch Doctrines and opinions, and practiſes in
worſhip, or ſhall reckon and account them Papiſts in heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and ſo they are of the number of his name, that is, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count:
ſuch <hi>numerantur Papiſtae,</hi> they aim at <hi>Popery,</hi> and though
their profeſſion deny it; yet when their actions and corruptions
in Doctrine and Worſhip ſhall ſpeak it in all mens Conſciences, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
all Orthodox reformed Proteſtants cannot but ſo judge
their wayes and actions to be ſuch as ſpeak to all mens hearts, the
<hi>Pope</hi> they only fear and worſhip. Farther he ſaith, they are thoſe
in <hi>Titus</hi> who deny God in their practiſes, they ſhall profeſs the
<hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, and in their practiſes and under-hand-deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and policies, depreſſed it, and advance the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Religion
and party.</p>
            <p>Theſe are juſtly to be accounted <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and receive the marke
of his name: (did you ever reade ſuch a bitter ſpirited man againſt
the heads of the Common-wealth of <hi>England?)</hi> yet he proceeds:
It imports (ſaith he) a ſecret cleaving to him, and ſo to be of his
Company, and truly as thoſe that receive his name; but yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profeſſion
go not ſo farre as to take that name, or the open own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:117866:24"/>
of him, yet really to do that which ſhall cauſe all men ſo to
reckon them; nor is this all (though this were enough to hang a
<hi>Presbyterian,</hi> if he ſhould ſo lay out the Common-wealths knave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
but he proceeds, and tells, when theſe with the beaſts number
ſhall appear in the world. They are (ſaith he) the laſt Champions
before the <hi>Popes</hi> fall: the Propheſie is of a Generation of men in
the laſt dayes who are lively ſet out in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. 10. ſelf-lovers,
covetous, boaſters, proud, blaſphemers, diſobedient to Parents, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful,
unholy, without natural affection, Covenant-breakers,
falſe accuſers, incontinent, fierce, deſpiſers of thoſe which are good,
Traytors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleaſure more then lovers
of God, having a form of godlineſs; but denying the power of it:
they are ſuch as creep into Widowes houſes, leading captive ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
women. This their folly (ſaith he) ſhall appear to all men, and
being diſcovered, it will be their ruine (Amen;) but yet they muſt
proceed further, even to the ſlaying of the witneſſes in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which is the tenth part of the City: theſe are called the laſt,
becauſe they are the laſt Champions of the beaſt, and are ſaid to be
overcome by the Witneſſes. All this (Reader) I aſſure thee I have
from Mr. <hi>Thomas Goodwins</hi> Manuſcript: now whether he have not
ſpoken high treaſon according to the late Acts, I leave thee to
judge. Without all doubt he hath ſpoken truth, and that's a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in this age; for though <hi>Independents</hi> may ſay any thing, yet
they ſeldom ſpeak truth now adayes. But Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> may be
forgiven: for this truth of his, is an old truth, and old truths are
out of date: he wrote this above ten years agoe, as I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and men change Religion and opinions, and principles, in ten
dayes now, and perhaps he is one of them; for 'tis incident to the
<hi>Goodwins,</hi> to walk the <hi>Antipodes</hi> to their own writings. By having
the name of the beaſt, I humbly conceive is to make an open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of his Authority and Power, to profes to be one of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers:
ſo on the contrary, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 9. there the followers of
the Lamb had his Fathers name written on them that was their
marke, the number of his name.</p>
            <p>There is a difference betwixt the name of the beaſt, and the beaſt it
ſelf the people of the earth meaſure: the beaſts name, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wonder at him; but they that have wiſdom number the beaſt
himſelf, and find him in every thing fall ſhort of the true meaſuring
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:117866:25"/>
Reed, and therefore reject him as an Hypocrite and uſurper. The
number of his name is put here in oppoſition to the number of
the beaſt in the next verſe. To have the number of his name is
to cry him up for a Saint by his good ſucceſs, and to honour him
for his proſperity, as fooles do; but he that hath wiſdom num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
the beaſt, and meaſures him by the word. If the beaſt be
numbred by his name he is a Saint, a deſtroyer of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> one
of Chriſts Inſtruments to pull down all thoſe that ſtand up againſt
his Kingdom: if you meaſure his Army by their name, they are all
Saints, the holy ones, teachers and preachers, men indued with
ſpiritual gifts, and divine qualifications beyond any Miniſter of the
Goſpel; this is their name, therefore they are called men of name,
<hi>(Revel. 11. 13.)</hi> which ſhall be ſlain at the riſing of the witneſſes,
they are cryed up for Saints, and admired by the world for their
ſucceſſes and Victories: they meaſure only their name, and that
makes them cry up this beaſt for a Saint; but marke what the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt ſaith, v. 18. Here is wiſdom: let him that hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
count the number of the beaſt. Here is wiſdom, this is a
phraſe not uſed by way of exclamation (as <hi>Pareus</hi> would have it;)
but in oppoſition to thoſe fooles and lack-wits, who meaſure the
name of the beaſt, that is, look upon him as he hath raiſed himſelf
into great wealth, and honour, and eſteeme in the world. Behold
(ſay they) his ſucceſſes, behold he is in poſſeſſion of the three
Kingdoms, behold his fair promiſes, behold his victories over his
enemies, behold how God hath anſwered his appeales to heaven:
he no ſooner appeales to Heaven ſay they; but he hath miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
ſucceſs againſt his enemies: the Moon fights for him, and the
Heavens fight for him, and he by a ſmall number diſcomfits great
Hoſts of men: and will any be ſo wicked as to think this man and
his Army are not all Saints, and his cauſe the juſt and the good
cauſe? whereas theſe men only meaſure the beaſt by his name,
they count the number of his name; but thoſe that have wiſdom
count the number of the beaſt. Thoſe that have the fear of God,
which is true underſtanding, meaſure not the name but the beaſt:
let him that hath underſtanding count the number of the beaſt.

now of theſe the greateſt is number, that hath the precedency: they
all depend one upon another, he that numbereth rightly, meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

You may number without meaſuring or weighing, but you cannot
weigh or meaſure without numbering: this differeth a foole from

can put things into the Scales to weigh; but he can neither mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

tell how many pounds it weighs, nor how many Gallons it
holds, becauſe he knowes not how to count and number them. A
Bowl of the Sanctuary which was of pure Gold, had it not been
weighed and meaſured, and the weight and meaſure numbered,
might poſſibly have been ſtole, and a guilded peece of Braſſe more

but now the Officers of the Temple could not be cheated, becauſe
they weighed, meaſured, and numbered it in the Church of God:
there are many peeces of <hi>Braſſe,</hi> and tinkling <hi>Simballs,</hi> which make
a farre more glorious ſhowe, then thoſe that are juſt weight, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

meaſured by the golden Reed, the word of God, and weighed and
meaſured, and ſummed up, they are found to light by thoſe that
have wiſdom, though fooles that look on their guilded out-ſides,
dote upon them.</p>
            <p>Let the ſpiritual wiſe man come and meaſure this beaſt that theſe

falſe, diſtembling guilded Hypocrite, they'l find him by the

            <p>And his number is 666. theſe words ſeem to aſſert the former,

now this is the number of a man, of mans deviſing, and not of

being numbered, he runs upon ſixes, his number runs upon ſixes:</hi> we
reade of one Gyant, an enemy to the Church that was famous for
having 6. fingers on his right hand, and 6. on his left; and 6. toes
on each of his feete, and we read of an Image, whoſe height was
60. Cubits, and whoſe breadth 6. Cubits; and here we reade of a

the number of this beaſt alludes to that Image <hi>in dura,</hi> which was
numbered 66. or not, I cannot tell, it may be ſo; for as that Image
was the cauſe of dreadful proſecution to the Saints of God, ſo
ſhall this beaſt cauſe ſore proſecution to fall upon the Saints of
God: yea, this beaſt ſhall be farre more cruel then any of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of the Church before him, he ſhall be more monſtrous in
his attempts againſt the Church, and he ſhall reach higher then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any enemy before him: the talleſt we reade of before was but
66. but this is 666. all the enemies, the moſt helliſheſt Traytors
could never yet root up the Proteſtant Government in <hi>England,</hi>
they could never blowe up King, Lords and Commons, by their
moſt ſecret plots; but this beaſt doth it at noon-day, in the face of
all the world. Oh that I had but room here to write his Hiſtory,
I ſhould make the eares of all that heard it tremble, to remember
theſe horrid unnatural villanies that this beaſt of the earth, whoſe
nummber is 666. hath committed, all the conſpiracies of <hi>Rome</hi> and
<hi>Spain</hi> (though they have not now been idle) could never yet do
the tenth part of that miſchief to the Magiſtry and Miniſtry of

when they had finiſhed their Teſtimony: how miſerably is our cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted
Reformation broken in pieces by the prevailing Treaſon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
of this beaſt. As for thoſe who ſeek to find the beaſt in the
number of his name, I conceive they ſtumble upon theſe two groſſe
miſtakes: they take the word number in a literal ſence, which is to be
interpreted in another ſence, it ſignifying there the due proportion of
the beaſt in number, weight and meaſure, thereby ſhewing he is an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper,
a thief and a robber, none of Gods appointment. 2. There is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
ſtumbling-block, at which Interpreters, not a few fall; they go
about to find the number of this beaſt in his name, whereas the Holy-Ghoſt
doth not bid us number his name (for that the fooles of the
world do) but he bids them count the number of the beaſt; count him
in his riſing, he roſe by his Lambs horns, and Dragons tongue, by flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
and hypocriſie, blaſphemies and deceits; count him in his acting,
he acts by the Devils and the Popes Commiſſion; count him in his
power, he ſets up his Sword-power, a tyranical unlawful power: count
him in his means of obtaining that power; and 'tis his ſignes and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
whereby he cheateth the people into a compliance with, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to his Power and Dominion. Look upon him, and count him in
his ſeveral Acts of power, and he is extreme tyranical; he makes it death
ſpeak againſt the new Government, and then he forceth men, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their own Conſciences, to ſubſcribe to his new Government, or
publickly to own it, by obſerving his publick edicts, and keeping and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnizing

monſtrous Tyrant againſt the Church, exceeding all that went
before him; for the <hi>Popes,</hi> they only drove the witneſſes into Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth,
but this beaſt ſlayes them. Thus have I tediouſly (though not
impertinently) ſhewed thee Reader, the beaſt that ſlayes the witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and the time when he doth ſlay them; and by this time, I doubt
nor, but thou ſeeſt that thoſe whom the Dr. my Antagoniſt, makes the
holy ones, are thoſe that ſlay the witneſſes, and thoſe (for whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
he impudently gave thanks) are the ſlain witneſſes, I meane
the lawful Governours, and Government in the State<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the lawful
Governours and Government in Church; for 'tis the Offices of both,
which being deſtroyed, may juſtly be called the ſlaying of the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:117866:27"/>
all rational ſober-minded Proteſtants may eaſily find the ſlain wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
if hee'l but look to the caſting down of the Covenant-Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the Inſtruments of that Covenant. In the Covenant he may
find their teſtimony, the which both Magiſtrate and Miniſters having
finiſhed, that is, fully agreed upon and reſolved effectually to put in
practice; up comes this beaſt of the earth, and with his Sword-power,
ſlayes them and their reformation, and this is the time of ſlaying of the
witneſſes: now this, (as we have proved) he did when he ſet up his
God <hi>Mauzzim, Dan.</hi> 11. 38. that is, his Sword-power, the which was
ſet up in <hi>Anno</hi> 1647. about <hi>Auguſt</hi> or <hi>December,</hi> when he got the

openly ſubſcribed to live and die with this fellow, whoſe deſigns were
to blow up King and Parliament, as ſince all the world hath ſeen it
true. I humbly conceive we may reckon the name of this beaſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
then, and the ſlaying of the witneſſes then to begin, ſo that the
next concluſion, or propoſition for me to prove will be this.</p>
            <p>That the beaſt of the earth that did ſlay theſe witneſſes, ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
&amp; the witneſſes that he ſlew ſhal riſe again about this year 1651
by ſlain witneſſes riſing again, I do not mean the ſame perſons that were
ſlain, but the ſame Offices that were pulled down, ſhall riſe again, the
lawful State, Government, and lawful Church-Government ſhall riſe
again, for the more plain and clear demonſtration of this, we muſt lay
down ſome few Propoſitions to be premiſed.</p>
            <p>1. That as the former part of the Revelation ſets forth the enemies of the
Church, and the Church her ſad condition under thoſe enemies, eſpecially
theſe 3. enemies, the Dragon, the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet: ſo from
<hi>Rev.</hi> 14. to the end, you have the viſion of the Raign of the beaſt, the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:117866:27"/>
and the falſe Prophet, and the riſing of the Church to a glorious
State.</p>
            <p>2. That the beaſts diſtruction that ſlayes the witneſſeſts, and the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
riſing again are at one and the ſame time; for as the beaſts riſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the witneſſes ruine were at once, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 7. ſo the witneſſes riſing and
the beaſts ruine ſhall be at once, as the cauſe and the effect. The beaſts ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
was the cauſe of the witneſſes falling, and the witneſſe riſing again is
the cauſe of the beasts ruine.</p>
            <p>3. That thoſe witneſſes are a goodly Magiſtracy, and a goodly Miniſtry,
which are called <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 4. 6. 7. 24. Elders, and 4. living Creatures; one
like a Lion, another like a Calfe, another like a man, and unother<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

near the Tabernacle, being in 24. Courſes, and the 4 beaſts were the 4.

4. Banners, to pitch on the <hi>North, Eaſt, Weſt,</hi> and <hi>South</hi> of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle

               </gap>theſe 4. round, and the Prieſts tipified a Goſpel Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
ſet to protect the Church and the Miniſtry from enemies without. This
godly Magiſtracy and Miniſtry, I humbly conceive are called <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 1.
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. the feete of Chriſt, the right foot and the left, <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. 4. there <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah</hi>
ſaw the feet of Chriſt ſtand on Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> (i. e.) the witneſſes aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſend
(as Rev. 11. 11. 12.) to Heaven, theſe are alſo called, (Rev. 11. 3. twoe
witneſſes, and v. 4. two <hi>Olive</hi> Trees, and two Candle-ſticks. <hi>Olive-Trees</hi>
to give ſvpply of Oyle to the <hi>Candle-ſticks,</hi> and <hi>Candle-ſticks</hi> to contene
that Oyl, the two chief Inſtruments of light in the Church, v. 5. theſe have
fire in their mouthes: therefore <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 13. they were like fire, and like
Lamps, there the wheeles and the beaſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſignified the Magiſtracy and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſthy,
as the beaſts draw the wheeles, and the wheeles ſupport the Arke
which was brought home, ſo the Magiſtracy and Miniſtry act for the good
of the Church, when the beaſts went, the wheeles went, and when the beaſts
were lifted up, the wheeles were lifted up, to note that as it fares with the
Magiſtracy, ſo it fares with the Miniſtry: if one goes up the other goes
up, if one goes down, the other goes down. <hi>Ezek.</hi> in that Chapter propheſies
principally of the glorious Goſpel-day which the Jews ſhall enjoy at the end of
the Roman Monarchy; but more of this hereafter: theſe two witneſſes are
called (as I conceive) Rev. 4. 15. 18. the Angel of the Temple, and the
Angel of the Altar, <hi>Solomon</hi> the King was he that built the Temple, he
was the Angel of the Temple; but the High Prieſt was the Angel of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:117866:28"/>
Altar, there he ſacrificed and offered, and he had power over the fire of the
Temple, theſe 5. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. are called Fathers, and Mothers in the
Church.</p>
            <p>Theſe are called, <hi>Revel</hi> 20. 4. the ſoules of them that were beheaded
for the witneſs of Jeſus, and thoſe which did not worſhip the beaſt, nor
his Image, nor had taken his mark on their foreheads, or on their
hands. This verſe ſhews the puniſhment which the Magiſtrates ſhall
undergoe, they ſhould be cut off with the Axe, (ſo <hi>Beza</hi> reads it) and
the other, to wit, the Miniſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y they ſhould ſuffer for not ſubſcribing
the beaſts Ingagement, they will not worſhip his Image, nor ſubject
unto it; they will neither with forehead, nor hand, give or receive,
the mark of the beaſt.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> That the Vials then begin to be powred out, when the
witneſſes ariſe, and this beaſt goeth to ruine; that's to be proved by
the Vials Objects. The firſt is the beaſt of the earth. The ſecond the
beaſt of the Sea. The third is the Prince of the ayr, that's the ſeventh
Vial, which falls on the ayr, which leads to the 5. propoſition.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> That the great Battel, <hi>Revel. 19. 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and the Vials pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
out are one and the ſame thing; for they have one and the ſame
Object, to wit, the beaſt of the Sea, the falſe Prophet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 20.
and the <hi>Dragon</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> the Prince of the ayr, <hi>Rev. 20. 2. and</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> That the thouſand years binding of Satan, and the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
years Raign of the Witneſſes with Chriſt, do not begin until the
great battel againſt the beaſt, and the falſe Prophet be fought
after this Battel: the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to the Goſpel, and return to their own Nation, and be united
under one King.</p>
            <p>All theſe propoſitions fall under the diſcourſe of the beaſts ruine,
and the witneſſes riſing. I will not undertake to diſcourſe particularly
at large on each of theſe particulars; for then I ſhould ſwell my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
into to a large volom, but only occaſionally as they fall in under
the general propoſition of the beaſt of the earths ruine, and the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
riſing.</p>
            <p>The exceeding many rubs that I have in my way, eſpecially thoſe
that <hi>Engliſh</hi> Expoſiters lay in my way, (I mean Proteſtant Writers,
either <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh.</hi> As <hi>Brightman, Pareus,
Meade, Bernard Napier,</hi> with ſeveral others) do not only pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> me to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:117866:28"/>
infinite pains, in uniting ravelled truth, but put me out of a
pleaſing method; for in this work, I am put to as much pains as
<hi>Alexander,</hi> when at once he anſwered ſix Embaſſador; how
much I am contrary to the opinion of the moſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Expoſiters,
my ſeaven forenamed Propoſitions ſhew; but how agreable
theſe propoſiters are to the mind of the Holy-Ghoſt, by the help of
the Holy-Ghoſt, I will make it my work to ſhew to the world from
the Scriptures themſelves, which are the beſt expoſitions of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>2. The ſecond general concluſion is, that which I ſhall how treat
of, <hi>(viz)</hi> That the beaſt of the earth that overcame and
ſlew the Witneſſes, ſhall be overcome, and the witneſſes
that were overcome and ſlain by him, ſhall riſe again, about
of this yeare 1651. For the proofe whereof, the firſt propoſition,
muſt be laid before the Reader, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that as the Holy-Ghoſt
ſhews <hi>John</hi> the firſt troubles of the Church under the Seales, unto
Conſtantine, (which were the perſecutions of the Heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
called the red <hi>Dragon)</hi> and the perſecutions of the Church
under the beaſt of the Sea, and the beaſt of the earth, from the time
of <hi>Antichrists</hi> riſing after <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> under the Trumpets; all
which reacheth to the 14. Chapter, ſo from the 14. Chapter, to
the 21. Chapter: the Holy Ghoſt ſets forth the riſing of the
Church, and the ruine of the enemy; in Chap. 13. He ſets forth
the Raign and Tyranny of the beaſt, of the Sea, and the beaſt of
the earth: the beaſt of the earth we have ſeen him in his riſing,
and in his Government, and we have numbered him in both, and
plainly uncaſed him to the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. In the 14. Chapter there is the Church coming out
of affliction, there is the ſlaying of the witneſſes ſet forth with the
cauſe, and a Propheſie of the beaſt of the earths ruine.</p>

again alludes much to Chriſts death and Reſurrection;
for as they muſt be confirmable to him in ſufferings, ſo
the Holy Ghoſt uſeth the like expreſſion to note that ſuch
like glorious effects ſhall be at the Witneſſes, riſing as
at Chriſts<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. In Chap. 16. You have the witneſſes pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
out the Vials on the beaſt of the earth, on the Sea,
<hi>i. e.</hi> the beaſt of the Sea, and the laſt Vial into the ayre,
that is on the Prince of the ayre: theſe three are the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
three great and leaſt enemies of the Church, that are
within the Church: as for the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> and
ſuch who know not, nor profeſs Chriſt, they are not
mentioned here, the Holy Ghoſt lookes at thoſe enemies
that ſhall be in this day of the powering out of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
within the Church, naming themſelves Chriſtians,
and profeſſing Saint-ſhip, as the Pope the Vicar of
Chriſt, and his party Catholique Saints and the beaſt of
the Earth and his party, new lighted Saints of a high
ſtrain; and the Prince of the ayre who rules in the
Children of diſobedience, cloakes his Traytors, and
blaſphemers, and deſpiſers of Gods word, and Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
and fornicators, ſwearers, and Anabaptiſts; with the
name of Saints, and to act all theſe in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
way of wickedneſs, muſt go for a high point
of Saint-ſhip. Theſe three Enemies you ſhall ſee
<pb n="1" facs="tcp:117866:29"/>
them all at the powring out of the ſixth viall, laying their
heads together, there is the Dragon, the Beaſt, and the falſe
Prophet, ſpitting venemous counſell againſt the Church, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
before they go to ruine at the great battell. In <hi>Rev:</hi>
17. you have an open view of the Beaſt of the Sea, and the
higheſt ſtate and pomp of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Beaſt of the earth, and
his kinde of Government, and manner of proceeding imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
before their overthrow and damnation, that is, in the
time of the Reign of the Beaſt of the earth, who ſlaies the
Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Revel:</hi> 18. is ſet forth the horrible deſtruction of <hi>Rome,</hi>

year: it ſeems to me to be about her year of Jubilee. In <hi>Revel:</hi>
19. you have the Saints thundring forth hallelujah for pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
down his Enemies, and ſetting up his own Throne, where
from <hi>v:</hi> 11. to that 3. verſe of Chap: 20. you have a view of

againſt the Beaſt, the Dragon, and the falſe Prophet, who

Expoſition of the three Chapters immediately preceding
them: As alſo the 11. Chapter, from <hi>v:</hi> 11. to the end. One
thing I will intreat the Reader to obſerve, from <hi>Rev: 13. v:</hi> 10.
and 18. at the riſing of the Beaſt of the earth the Holy-Ghoſt,
as it were, <hi>Ex abrupto,</hi> uſeth this expreſſion, here is the faith,
and here is the patience of the Saints: To note that the riſing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117866:30"/>
of the Beaſt of the earth ſhould certainly be the time when
the Witneſſes ſhould be under ſore affliction, their offenſive
weapons ſhould be taken from them, and their faith and
patience which are defenſive weapons, which two, onely
Saints have, and with which they are able to beat a road
through Hell, through the deepeſt ſorrows and troubles.
Now theſe graces this Beaſt of the Earth, by his cruell perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions,
will make them eminently to exerciſe while he
reigns. But in <hi>ver:</hi> 18. when his reign comes to an end, then
ſaith the holy Ghoſt, <hi>[Here is wiſdome.] Let him that hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
count the number of the Beast.</hi> Now the Beaſt comes to
be meaſured, 'tis not <hi>[Here is the faith and patience]</hi> but <hi>[Here is

ſaith he,</hi> v: 10. If any man worſhip the Beaſt and his Image,
and receive his mark in his forhead, or on his hand the ſame
ſhall drink the wine of the wrath of God, v: 11. Yea of the
pure wine which is powred into the cup of his wrath, and he
ſhall be tormented with fire and brimſtone, in the preſence of
the holy Angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb. v: 12.
And they have no reſt day nor night, who worſhip the Beaſt
and his Image, and receive the mark of his name, there is
the patience of the Saints, here are they that keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
of God, and the faith of Ieſus. <hi>Theſe words

and that is in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 10. immediately before the riſing of the Beaſt
of the Earth. Now here they are repeated, to ſhew the cauſe of the
Saints ſufferings, it ſhall be for oppoſing this Beaſt of the Earths
new Government, and not ſubſcribing to be true and faithfull to
it, which is here ſet down by worſhipping the Beaſt and his Image,

ſlaying; therefore in <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. there is a heavenly voice that ſays
<hi>Bleſsed are the dead which die in the Lord:</hi> and the Spirit gives two

works follow them:</hi> To read it according to the Greek copie, 'tis
<hi>[but their works follow them,]</hi> to note, though the Witneſſes be
ſlain, and that Reformation which they ſo laboured in, be for a time
plucked out of their hands, ſo that they are forced (as <hi>Nehemiah)</hi>
to ceaſe from their labors, yet that work ſhall follow them, the
work of Reformation ſhall follow the ſlain Witneſſes; <hi>Bleſsed are
the dead:</hi> this is either to ſet out the horrible tribulation of theſe
times, (as in <hi>Matth. 24. Mark</hi> 13. and <hi>Luke</hi> 21. they are called) ſo
that he ſhall be bleſſed that is taken to God, from out of theſe
troubles; or rather for incouragement to the godly Magiſtracy
and Miniſtery, which are perſecuted, impriſoned, and baniſhed, and
in danger of their lives, for keeping their Covenant, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
and not breaking Gods commandements, either the firſt or
the ſecond Table. Therefore Ver. 12. it is added <hi>[Here are they that
keep the commandements of God]</hi> it ſeems it ſhall be a time of tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling
Gods Law under foot, ſo that they that keep Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
ſhall be rare and eminent men, it ſhall be a rare thing to
find a faithfull man: <hi>When Christ comes</hi> ('tis ſpoken of this time, of
his coming in the white cloud, as followes) <hi>ſhall he find faith on the
earth?</hi> 'Twill be a rare thing to find either faithfull Magiſtrate or
Miniſter, or men of a ſtrong faith: moſt men will comply and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
through the weakneſſe of their faith. Obſerve what followes
this time of ſlaying the Witneſſes, verſ. 14. <hi>And I looked, and behold
a white cloud, and upon the cloud one like the Son of Man, having on his
head a golden crown, and in his hand a ſharp ſickle.</hi> After the ſlaying
of the Witneſſes immediately followes Chriſt in the cloud, with
his ſickle in his hand. Obſerve that in the 14, 15, 16. Chapter they

               </gap>]
to be found: the matter in the three Chapters is copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:
In the firſt part of this Chapter you have the Witneſſes fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
their teſtimony; the Church coming out of <hi>Babylon:</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made a progreſſe in reformation, the chief inſtruments are
ſlain; the Magiſtrates and the Miniſters who had taken infinite
pains, had thrown down Superſtition, Prelacy and Popery, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted
to eſtabliſh the Goſpell in its purity, theſe on a ſuddain,
when they had finiſhed their teſtimony, are caſt out of their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
impriſoned, baniſhed and beheaded. In <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4. there is the
manner of the Witneſſes puniſhment, and the cauſe of their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<hi>For the cauſe of Chriſt, and for the Word of God,</hi> for going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to eſtabliſh the truth of Chriſt according to the Word of
God (for ſo the Covenant runs) they were cut off with the axe:
There's both the Magiſtrates puniſhment and the cauſe plainly ſet
down: <hi>And which did not worſhip the Beast, neither his image, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had taken his mark on their foreheads, or on their hands;</hi> that is,
they refuſed to acknowledge or own the authority of the Beaſt of
the Earth: 'tis certain that this can be meant of none but the Beaſt
of the Earths government; for this power of ſetting up an Image,
and inforcing men to worſhip it, is attributed to none but him:
And whether the puniſhments preſcribed be not now inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Covenant-keeping Miniſtery this day, let all the world
judge: There hath nothing been ſo clearly fulfilled in the eyes of
the world this thouſand years, as this of the ſlaying of the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
this day in our eyes: Oh that we had hearts to conceive aright
of it. Verſ. 4. But now followes the glorious day, Chriſt in a white
cloud: Here two Propoſitions muſt be cleared: Firſt, Here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
the ſeventh trumpet to ſound: Secondly, The ſeventh ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cauſeth all the vialls to be powred out, on the Beaſt of the
Earth, on the Beaſt of the Sea, and on the Prince of the Ayre. Then
begins the ſeventh trumpet to ſound, when Chriſt begins to take
the Kingdoms of the world, and make them his own, and reigne
over them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15. But in <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 14. then Chriſt is crowned
with a golden crown, when he ſits on his white cloud; therefore
the time of Chriſts coming in the cloud is the time of the ſeventh
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:117866:32"/>
trumpets ſounding; and for this cauſe, ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, (leſt
men ſhould miſtake the time) <hi>Rev. 11. 14. The ſecond woe is paſt, and
the third woe cometh quickly, when the two Witneſses ſtand upon their
feet and are called up to heaven then the ſeventh trumpet coms ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and without delay,</hi> for ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifies; therefore <hi>Rev.</hi>
16. 15. in the very middle of the narration of the great battell, that
the Dragon, the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet ſhall f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ght againſt the
Lamb; when they gather together to that great battell, Chriſt
gives this warning to the Church, that when he is a coming, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
gathering together with great ſtrength and force, is a true
ſigne of Chriſts coming But how doth he come? The text an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,
<hi>Behold I come as a thief: Latro, quia latenter inſidiatur,</hi> that
is, ſuddenly, before a man expects him, he is up with a man on a
ſudden before he is provided for him: So will Chriſt fall upon his
enemies in a day when they look not for him, and in an hour when
they are not aware of him, <hi>When they were gathered together,</hi> v. 17.
<hi>then the ſeventh Angell powred out his viall,</hi> and then a loud voice
coms out of the temple, ſaying, <hi>'Tis done,</hi> that is, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 7. the
myſtery of God, the great myſtery is finiſhed, as he hath declared
by his ſervants the Prophets; ſo that, of the ſounding of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
trumpet, it ſeems the Prophets have propheſied.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh trumpet ſounding, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 5. Chriſt ſitting on the
white cloud, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 14. crowned the ſeventh Angell powring out
his viall into the ayre, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 17. and Chriſt riding on a white
horſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 11. who had on his head many crowns, <hi>v.</hi> 12. and was
cloathed with a garment dipt in bloud, <hi>v.</hi> 13. and had an hoſt cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
in white linnen, and out of whoſe mouth goeth a ſharp
ſharp ſword, to ſmite the Gentiles withall, <hi>v.</hi> 15. whoſe name is
written on his veſture, and thigh, <hi>the King of kings, and Lord of
lords, v.</hi> 16. and the great battell, from <hi>v.</hi> 17. with the effects of it,
to <hi>v.</hi> 5. of <hi>chap.</hi> 20. theſe all ſet out one and the ſame thing, <hi>viz.</hi> The
deſtruction of three grand enemies of the Church within the
Church, and the reſtoring of a godly Magiſtracy and Miniſtery to
its former luſtre and beauty; to the thorough carrying on of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
which the Dragon, the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet, the
three grand enemies, deſtroyed, in deſtroying the two Witneſſes,
<hi>(i.e.)</hi> the godly Magiſtracie and Miniſtery, that lead the people out
of ſpirituall <hi>Babylon.</hi> Theſe things will be cleered in due place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:117866:33"/>
The ſecond is that which I ſuppoſe moſt Engliſhmen will op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
becauſe it oppoſeth moſt Engliſh writers, and oppoſeth the
Doctor in his new Thankſ-giving book <hi>P.</hi> 2. who ſaith, we are
under the ſixth Seal, and the ſixth Trumpet of that Seal, and
under the fourth Viall of that Trumpet, if not under the fifth. I'le
run after his fantaſtick ſtuffe no farther, by way of repetition, but
return to my ſecond Propoſition, and prove that none of the Vialls
are yet powred out, becauſe they are not powred out untill the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Trumpet ſound, that's Argument of it ſelf ſufficient, for the
ſeventh Trumpet hath not yet ſounded, <hi>ergo,</hi> no vialls are as yet
powred out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument.</hi> I prove that none of the Vialls ſhall be powred out,
untill the ſeventh Trumpet ſound, from <hi>Revel.</hi> 15. 5. and <hi>Revel.</hi>
11. 15. 19.</p>
            <p>The Vialls are not powred out untill the Angells come out of
the Temple, <hi>Rev.</hi> 25. 16. and they come not out, untill the Temple
of the Tabernacle of the Teſtimony in heaven was open, <hi>v.</hi> 5. but
the Temple of God was not opened in heaven, untill the ſeventh
Trumpet ſounded, <hi>Rev. 11. 15. 19. ergo,</hi> the Vialls cannot be powred
out, untill the ſeuenth Trumpet ſound.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Argument.</hi> I may argue thus from <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. 1. If no Vialls be
powred out, untill <hi>John</hi> heard a voice out of the Temple, then none
are as yet powred out; for no voice coms out of the Temple, untill
the Temple be open, and the Angells come out, which we have
clearly proved, is not till the ſeventh. Trumpet ſounds, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
Trumpet ſounds not, untill Chriſt come in the cloud crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to poſſeſſe the Kingdomes, and to deſtroy the three grand ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
the Beaſt of the Sea, which kept the Witneſſes in Sackcloth,
and the Beaſt of the Earth, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lays the Witneſſes, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,
who raigns and rages againſt the Goſpell, with his crue of
Traytors, blaſphemers, heretikes, and the like, which is not yet ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
therefore no Vialls are powred out.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Argument.</hi> If no Vialls be powred out, untill the Viall be pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out on the earth, which cauſeth a noyſome and grievous ſore
upon the men which had received the mark of the Beaſt, and upon
them which worſhipped his Image, then no Viall is as yet powred
out; for by earth, is here meant the Beaſt of the Earth, and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:117866:33"/>
Now the Beaſt of the Earth and his followers, we proved
already were not in being, untill 1647. and no Viall hath been pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out upon him as yet, for he is now raging over, and trampling
under the ſlain Witneſſes; therefore none of the Vialls are as yet
powred out, nor can we expect them, untill the three years and an
half of his raign be expired, which we hope is not many moneths
longer.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Argument.</hi> But to take an Argument <hi>ad hominem,</hi> there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
learned Divines of theſe later dayes, who hold that the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
are to powre out the Vialls, the ſlain Witneſſes riſing do it, this
is moſt probable; if ſo, then I bring a double argument thus, If the
Witneſſes riſing powre out the Vialls, then no Vialls have yet been
powred out; for as a learned Divine, <hi>November</hi> 5. laſt ſaid, The
Witneſſes are not yet riſen, their riſing will be conſpicuous, when
they riſe, the Saints ſhall ſing the Song of <hi>Moſes, Rev.</hi> 15. 3. and they
ſhall be a terrour to all their enemies round about them, who ſhall
ſee their riſing and tremble at it, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 11. they ſhall put on
white linnen (which is another Argument) <hi>Revel</hi> 15. 6. before they
go to powre out the Vialls: but from the time of the Popes raigns,
to the time of the Beaſt of the Earths raign the Witneſſes were in
Sackcloth, and therefore could not powre out the Vialls, and ſince
they have been ſlain, and now are dead, dead in Law, out-lawed
perſons, dethroned, degraded, ſecluded, ſequeſtered, and diſſipated
them, ſo that untill the ſlain Witneſſes riſe, there can be no Vialls
powred out; and by conſequence none are powred out, for the
Witneſſes are not riſen.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant how there are very many and learned Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
who ſay that at leaſt an hundred years ago, ſome of the Vials
were powred out, but what ground have they from Scripture to
ſay ſo? every Scholler poſitively concludes none at all; what then
is their ground, but only the ſtrength of their fancy in crooking
ſacred texts to corrupt hiſtories: as for example, <hi>Pareus</hi> is of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that <hi>Luther</hi> powred out the firſt Viall upon the earth, when he
preached againſt Pardon-Mongers and Indulgences, and all the
ground he hath for it, is, becauſe he finds that <hi>Luther</hi> was a ſtout
oppoſer of Pardon-mongers and Canoniſts; whereas he that reads
but with an impartiall eye the hiſtory of the German Churches,
ſince <hi>Luther,</hi> will rather conclude that the Pope powred out a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
on the German Churches, then the German Churches on him;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:117866:34"/>
'tis the moſt ſenſeleſſeſt thing, and the moſt rediculous in the
world, for wiſe men to affirm, that four or five of the Vialls
are powred out on Rome and the Pope, when the Pope and Rome
were never in greater pomp (witneſſe this yeare of Jubilee at
Rome) and his Councells and politick devices never more proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
ſucceeded then now. 'Tis true indeed, <hi>Huſse</hi> and <hi>Hierome of
Prague,</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi> and thoſe German Princes, who defended
thoſe truths which their Miniſters taught, prove that there were
Witneſſes then in being; but for certain, the Pope made them wear
ſackcloth, all Europe will affirm it. Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the famouſeſt
Princeſſe in the world againſt the Pope, how was ſhe, and her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery
and Kingdom kept in ſackcloth? once the Armado from
Spain put her and all the Kingdom to faſting and ſackcloth; ſhe
her ſelf went daily in danger of her life; at leaſt twelve ſeverall
attempts of treaſon againſt her perſon were diſcovered, ſo that ſhe
eſcaped hardly the Popes clutches with her life. Now to call this a
powring out of the vialls on Rome, is that that gives juſt occaſion
to the Papiſts to ſcorn and deride our Expoſitors: Let not Rome
think that ſhe hath had one of her plagues yet: When God
powres out his vialls upon her, ſhe ſhall feel then to the purpoſe:
Romes plagues are not to come till the politick State have reigned
1260. years, and then let Rome know, in a day, that is, a yeare,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 18. her plagues ſhall come upon her. The Beaſt of the Earth
muſt lead the way to deſtruction, in whoſe ruine the chief ſtrength
of the Pope ſhall go to ruine, and the Devill too; and therefore
'tis (I conceive) that in the great battell, that this Beaſt ſhall fight
againſt the Lamb; for none but he this day is capable in perſon to
fight againſt the Lamb, and his 144000. followers: For I conceive
by this completeneſſe of the number of Chriſts followers, 'tis
meant a Nationall Church that he fights againſt; if ſo, then it muſt
be <hi>Scotland,</hi> or no Nation in the world; for they onely are a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinall
Church truly reformed. When he is overcome, 'tis ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi>
20. 21. that the Pope was taken when this falſe Prophet is taken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Popes intereſt is moſt concerned in this Beaſts over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.
Could the Pope (who by his Beaſt works all his miracles in
the ſight of the Pope, or with his approbation) overthrow the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted
people in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Proteſtant Cauſe
would not have reſt for the ſole of its foot in the world, and then
the Pope would flouriſh: But if the Covenauters in <hi>Scotland</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:117866:34"/>
ſhould prevaile againſt the Beaſt of the Earth there, the Pope muſt
not look to ſtand long, and that the Romiſh Polititians know, they
have read the Covenant over and over, and know full well the
contents of it, and the intentions of the takers and keepers of it,
ſo that the Popes intereſt is highly concerned in the ſucceſſe of the
Beaſt of the Earth, who bears him up; who falling, (which will
doubtleſſe be very ſuddenly, for the viall is firſt powred on him,
<hi>Rev. 16. 2.)</hi> immediatly followes the vialls upon the Romiſh party,
and ſo Romes ruine coms on a ſudden.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe who affirm in their writings, that there is a large
ſpace of time betwixt viall and viall in its powring out: I dare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the contrary, that they have no cauſe nor ground for it in the
world: 1. Not from <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. from <hi>v.</hi> 1. rather the contrary is
proved; for there is command given at once to the ſeven Angells
to powre out the ſeven vialls. 2. They are called vialls, which
(ſay the learned) are wide-mouthed and large veſſells, like a kettle,
to ſignifie large and ſudden meaſures of wrath on Gods enemies:
<hi>Sodom</hi> (with two Angells who powred out their vialls on it) was
utterly deſtroyed on the ſudden with a terrible deſtruction; but
here are ſeven Angells and ſeven vialls, to note the terrible and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible
deſtruction, and the full and complete deſtruction of the
enemies: this deſtruction that God ſhall bring on theſe laſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in theſe laſt dayes, ſhall be to their finall ruine; and therfore
'tis that <hi>Babylons</hi> ruine is compared, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 21. to a milſtone caſt
into the ſea, and <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 20. the enemies were caſt into the lake,
which burns with fire and brimſtone, that is, into hell: now out of
hell there is no redemption, theſe are the ſame enemies on which
the vialls are powred out. Though here the Beaſt of the Earth be
called the falſe Prophet, it is but to let us know 'tis the ſame Beaſt
that makes fire come down from heaven, <hi>(Rev. 13. 13.)</hi> that is, before
he takes in hand his enterpriſes, that he may cheat the fooliſh peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the world, he makes open appeales to God in the ſight of
the world, to own his cauſe, and give him ſucceſſe according to his
integrity herein: He imitates <hi>Elias;</hi> and after he hath faſted, and
prayed, and made his appeales, he hath his deſired ſucceſſe, and then
he makes the world believe 'tis the return of his prayers: all which
makes the world cry up his cauſe for Gods cauſe, and him and his
party for the true Saints, and the great Reformers: But for all his
ſucceſſes, he is but a falſe prophet, a lying, traiterous, perjured, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:117866:35"/>
enemy to the Church and Saints of God. Theſe ſeven Vialls
are but figurative expreſſions of the ſuddain, terrible, and finall
wrath of God upon the enemies of his Church, which we ſhall find
againſt the ſame enemies in <hi>Iſaiah 11. 15. Zach. 10. 11. Luke 21. 23.
Matth. 24. 29. Mark</hi> 13. 24. I will briefly tovch upon them all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they give much light unto our preſent diſcourſe; obſerve this
by the way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note.</hi> That the finiſhing of the Myſtery of God, in the daies of
the voice of the ſeventh Trumpet, is for certain revealed to the
Prophets in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Revel.</hi> 10. 7. and I am very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that this is the day that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaw, <hi>Ezek. 1. Chap.</hi> 10, and this
is the day that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſings of, indeed it was their fervent deſire,
that were Saints under the old Teſtament, to ſee the day of Chriſts
appearing in the fleſh; therefore <hi>Cant. 1. 2. Let him kiſſe me with the
kiſſes of his mouth, for his Love is better then Wine:</hi> They under the
Law were kiſſed only with <hi>Moſes</hi> mouth, they received the Law
from his mouth, the moſt ſoul-refreſhingſt part of it conſiſting in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
in meat Offerings, &amp; drink Offerings, Wine &amp; Oyl, but they
deſired the Ordinances from Chriſts mouth, which was better then
ſuch Wine, better then the Ceremoniall Sacrifices; but when Chriſt
came in the fleſh amongſt them to give them Ordinances, <hi>v.</hi> 5. they
looked on Chriſts blackneſſe, they looked on his mean parentage,
his poverty, and his ſufferings, they looked on him, as on the Tents
of <hi>Keder,</hi> which were courſe, mean, baſe things, what (ſaid they) is
not this the Carpenters Son? they looked only on his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which was as mean as the Tents of <hi>Keder,</hi> but they looked not
on his Divine Nature, which was glorious as the Curtains of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
which was of moſt rich ſtuffe, and curiouſly wrought, this they
looked not on, but <hi>(ver. 6.)</hi> on the blackneſſe of Chriſt, becauſe the
wrath of Gods hot diſpleaſure ſcorched him on the Croſſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his mothers children <hi>(i.e.)</hi> the Jews were angry with him, and
this was all the reaſon, becauſe he neglected his own ſafety, and
comfort, and eaſe, and life, to give them ſafety, and comfort, eaſe,
and eternall life; he was the Keeper of the Vineyards, but his own
Vineyard he had not kept. He was the Churches keeper, though he
kept not himſelf from Gods wrath.</p>
            <p>This day of Chriſts coming in the fleſh, the Jewes thus by their
blindneſſe and unbelief loſt, and therefore that day is not the day
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:117866:35"/>
that the Prophets mean in their Prophecies ſhall be the glorious day
to the Jewes, but (as the Rabbins ſay, and that (as to that) truly)
it is ſome glorious day of reſtoring the twelve Tribes again in the
end of the Roman Monarchy: this day was the day that the Jews
(that believed in Chriſt when he was on earth) looked for; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſaid ſome of them, <hi>Wilt thou at this time reſtore the kingdome to
Iſrael? Acts</hi> 2. They did look for a reſtoring of the kingdom of
Iſrael to its former luſtre, as in <hi>Davids</hi> time: This will be at the
ſounding of the ſeventh trumpet: and of this myſtery at this
time to be revealed, he Prophets have propheſied; as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. there
you have a Propheſie of the Goſpell day; and from Chriſts incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to the end of the Roman Monarchy; for the three other
Monarchies were paſt, and only the Roman Monarchy in being,
when Chriſt was born. In the eleven firſt verſes there is ſet forth
the excellency of Chriſt the Author of the Goſpell, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
effects of his Goſpell. Now in this Goſpell-day God will
recover the ſecond time the remnant of his people, that is, Iſrael,
from <hi>Aſſyria</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and from the Iſlands of the Sea: This day
of redemption muſt of neceſſity be the day of redeeming the
Jews from under the Roman Monarchy: for <hi>Paul Rom. 15. 12.)</hi>
quotes <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 10. to ſhew that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> propheſied of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the Gentiles believing in him: Now this of the Gentiles
converſion was under the Roman Monarchy, therfore <hi>(Iſa. 11. v. 11)</hi>
the recovering again of Iſrael and Juda muſt be meant of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
by Chriſt, and converſion under the Roman Monarchy:
this no rational Textman can deny, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12, 13, 14. you ſhal find theſe
expreſſions quoted by Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. their flying on the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Philiſtims of the Weſt, <hi>v.</hi> 14. is to expreſſe the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
the Jewes ſhall have in their converſion to Chriſt by the
deſtruction of the Weſtern Roman Empire, which are their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Philiſtims, who allow them not to ſearch the Word, they
keep all ſpirituall weapons from them, and by their ſpirituall
wickedneſſe and ſuperſtition harden the poore Jewes in unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief:
therefore the Pontiſick State is called <hi>(Revel. 7.)</hi> in Hebrew
<hi>Abaddon, i.e.</hi> a deſtroyer. In <hi>Iſa. 11. v.</hi> 12. &amp; 13. there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Argument: For God promiſeth here to gather Iſrael and
Juda; Ephraim, (that is, the Royall Family of the ten Tribes)
ſhall not envy Juda, nor Juda vex Ephraim, the twelve Tribes ſhall
be united; but they were never yet gathered together ſince the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:117866:36"/>
Babyloniſh Captivity, nor were they ever united as yet, therefore
this is to be fulfilled: Now in that day when theſe things ſhall be
accompliſhed, <hi>v. 14, 15. Edom, Moab</hi> and <hi>Ammon,</hi> that is, all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes,
who are the worſt of enemies to the true Church; for <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
came of <hi>Eſau</hi> the apoſtate, <hi>v.</hi> 14. and <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi> were
the ſons of <hi>Lot,</hi> begotten and born in inceſt. Now all theſe in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ages
pretended that they were the true begotten ſons of the
Church; the Edomites ſaid that their father <hi>Eſau</hi> was the firſt born
of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and therefore they were the true Church. The Moabites
and the Amorites they ſaid that <hi>Lot</hi> was their Grand father, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are the true Church. Now theſe three were the baſeſt,
maliciouſeſt, and cruelleſt enemies that the true Chruch had, and ſo
are heretikes and Apoſtates, which the world ſhall be full of <hi>(Mat.
24. 26. 29.)</hi> before the converſion of the Jewes; but theſe ſhall be
trodden underfoot: as <hi>David</hi> when he came to the crown ſubdued
them round about, ſo will God, <hi>v.</hi> 15. and God will deſtroy the
tongue of the Egyptian Sea, that is, the Popedome, which is the
tongue of the Roman Church, which is ſpirituall Egypt, and ſmite
it in the ſeven ſtreames, that they may go over drie-ſhod: this
Chriſt quotes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 12. there is the river which God will ſmite in
the ſeven ſtreames and drie it up, that Iſrael may come to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell:
<hi>Romes</hi> accurſed doctrine, pomp and tyranny ſhall come to
ruine, not only at <hi>Rome,</hi> but in the Weſt and Eaſt India's there God
ſhall break the Popiſh Religion, and the Tribes ſhall take notice of
Gods mighty hand, and give glory to God: the like expreſſion
we have in <hi>Zacharia, Zach.</hi> 10. from <hi>v.</hi> 6. to <hi>v.</hi> 9. the Jewes conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
is declared: This <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> conceives is meant of the
Jewes converſion: this was begun (ſaith he) by the Apoſtles, but
ſhall be perfected by the two Witneſſes: I like well the words in
ſome ſenſe; they are doubtleſſe moſt true, but <hi>v.</hi> 11. when he doth
this, what will he do? he will paſſe through the Sea with afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(the Septuagint reads it, <hi>He will paſſe through the narrow Sea.)</hi>
and ſhall ſmite the waves thereof, and the deeps of the river ſhall
drie up, and the pride of <hi>Aſhur</hi> ſhall be brought down, and the
Scepter of Egypt ſhall depart away: Compare theſe places with
the Vialls, and they are all one, as in time, ſo in expreſſion: but I
am too tedious. In <hi>Mat, 24. Mark</hi> 13. and <hi>Luke</hi> 21. we may find
all the Vialls there mentioned: I will touch upon one for all.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:117866:36"/>
               <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 24. there begins the Jews woes and ſorrowes from the
time of Jeruſalems deſtruction downward, untill the time of the
Gentiles be fulfilled, what's the meaning of that? Look in <hi>Rom,</hi>
12. 25. there is repeated, that blindneſs, in part, is hapned to <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
untill the fulneſs of the Gentiles be come in; 'tis all one with
that expreſſion, Untill the time of the Gentiles be fulfilled; but
when is the time of the Gentiles fulfilled? look in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 2. there
the time of the Gentiles, that is, the time of Antichriſts raign (ſay
all or the moſt Interpreters) is 42 moneths (Salary moneths)
which make 1260 dayes, dayes being put for years, the
meaning is, the full time of Antichriſts Raign is 1260 years;
and when theſe years are expired, then the fulneſs of the Gentiles
is come in, and then all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt; as
<hi>Eſay</hi> 59. 20. the place that <hi>Paul</hi> quotes, where had we time, it
were eaſie to give the Reader an exact view of theſe times, in the
precedent matter to the text: there we may ſee Chriſts coming
to repay vengeance to the Enemies in the Iſlands, that the Weſt
may fear God; and this ſhall be done, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. when the Enemy
comes in like a floud, and how it ſhall be done? the Spirit of the
Lord ſhall lift up a ſtandart againſt him: this is abſolutely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied
of that time, when the fulneſs of the Gentiles is come in;
that is, when the time of Antichriſts Raign is accompliſhed: I am
not ignorant how far I am from the common interpretations of
this text; but I am confident, upon Scripture-grounds, I come
neerer the mind of the Holy Ghoſt, then they that ſay, by the
fulneſs of the Gentiles, is meant, the glorious time of the full
coming in of the Gentiles to the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Blindneſs is hapned, in part, to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> until the fulneſs of the
Gentiles be come in; here is the meaſure of the time of the Jews
rejection from the Goſpel, ſo long as till the fulneſs of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
be come in. If by fulneſs of the Gentiles be meant their
full converſion, then the Jews ſhall not be converted until the
full converſion of the Gentiles be accompliſhed: but this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Apoſtles words in the ſame Chapter, for <hi>ver. 12. Now</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
of them the riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fulneſs?</hi>
So that by this text, it is clear, that the riſing of the Jews ſhall be
the bringing in of a far greater number of Gentiles to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:117866:37"/>
then their fall could do; and therefore 'tis that the Prophet
ſaith, In this day people ſhall flock in to the Goſpel, <hi>as the Doves
to the windows; and ten women ſhall take hold of the skirt of a Jew,
and go after him;</hi> that is, embrace his Religion, being a Chriſtian:
And hence it is, that at the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet a
voice is heard crying aloud, <hi>That all the Kingdomes in the world
are become the Lords, becauſe of the great converſion of Soules
throughout the world;</hi> that ſhall be when the Jews begin to come
in to Chriſt: So that the fulneſs of the Gentiles, in that place,
cannot mean any other then as <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 24. expreſſeth it, <hi>the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
the times of the Gentiles,</hi> which <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 2. is 42 Moneths,
and that is 1260 years (the full time of Antichriſts raign) and ſo
long the true Church (which is Jeruſalem) ſhall be trodden under
foot, <hi>Cajetan</hi> well obſerves (though few of the Romiſh Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which quote him obſerve it) that <hi>donec plenitudo gentium
intret,</hi> is the myſtery which <hi>Paul</hi> would have the Romans not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of, leſt they ſhould think too well of their Church; and
doubtleſs this is the myſtery which the Holy Ghoſt <hi>(Rev. 10. 7.)</hi>
ſaith ſhall be finiſhed in the dayes of the voice of the ſeventh
Trumpet, as the Prophets have declared. So that we muſt look
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to the propheſies concerning this myſtery, and the ſeventh
Trumpet, as well as into the Writings of the Apoſtles. <hi>Beda</hi> on
<hi>Luke</hi> 21. 24. ſaith, that it is the ſame with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 25. and many
of the Popiſh Doctors agree with him, which is as much as I will
deſire, to make good my aſſertion. The Ancients, and many of
the Romiſh Doctors conclude, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be converted to
Chriſt about the end of the World. Saith the ordinary gloſſe
in the end of the World when Antichriſts falſhood ſhall be dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
and (ſaith <hi>Abelardus)</hi> in the end of the world they ſhall
be converted, <hi>per</hi> the Witneſſes. So ſaith <hi>Remigerus:</hi> Now the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
riſe not untill the full time of Antichriſts raign be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 11. Therfore when the fulneſs of the Gentiles ſhall
come in; that is, Antichriſts raign ſhall be accompliſhed, <hi>Iſrael</hi>
ſhall be converted: Of this opinion I ſuppoſe learned Proteſtants
are, That the Romiſh Apoſtacy, is the cauſe of the Jews Obſtacy;
untill the deſtruction of which, they ſhall continue in their blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
This opinion <hi>Contzenus</hi> the Jeſuit cries out of, as the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Hereticks. I conceive he cryeth moſt againſt learned
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:117866:37"/>
               <hi>Melancthon,</hi> who on that text tels us, of the ruine of the Gentiles
Church by hereſies, and apoſtacy; which apoſtacy being fulfilled,
the Jews ſhall be converted: To this purpoſe he ſpeaketh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
and truly; but mark what follows in <hi>Luk. 21. 25. After
the time of the Gentiles is fulfilled, then there ſhal be ſigns in the Sun,
and in the Moon, and in the ſtars; and upon the earth diſtreſs of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
with perplexity, the ſeas and the waves roaring, mens hearts fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, for the powers of heaven ſhalbe ſhaken.</hi> Theſe are the vials
that ſhalbe poured out on the Churches enemies; and what then?
ver. 27. <hi>Then ſhall they ſee the Son of Man coming in a cloud;</hi> and
then, ver. 18. <hi>When they ſee theſe things begin to come to paſs, let the
Jews lift up their heads for their redemption draweth nigh:</hi> compare
<hi>Matth.</hi> 24. and <hi>Mark</hi> 13. with this text: this day muſt be meant
of the Jews converſion, therefore it ſets forth ſome Goſpel-day;
for ſhould it be the day of Judgment, it would be the day of their
Damnation: therefore when the vials are poured out, they ſhall
ſee the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
this leads me back to the text that I have run away ſo long
from, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 14. there immediatly the witneſſes were ſlain,
<hi>John</hi> looked, and behold a white cloud, and on the cloud one ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
like the Son of Man, having in his hand a crown, there's his
glory; and with a ſharp ſickle, there is his power; and then there
are the Angels, the Angel out of the Temple, and the Angel from
the Altar, and they make ſupplication, that the harveſt of the
earth, which is ripe, may be reaped by Chriſt, who had the ſharp
ſickle in his hand; and at their ſupplication Chriſt goes to work
with the Vines of the Vineyard of the Earth, and cuts them
down; and then the bloud of the Vines of the Earth, that is, the
power of the beaſt of the Earth is broken, and their bloud in a
great meaſure ſhed at the ſame time, <hi>Revel. 15. John</hi> ſaw another
ſign in Heaven great and marvellous; this great ſign is that in,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 24. and <hi>Mark</hi> 13. the ſign is ſeven Angels, with the ſeven
plagues; the great ſign is Gods eminent wrath againſt the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Monarchy, in all its power and ſtrength; for by clouds, trees,
waves of the Sea, and ſtars, <hi>Jude</hi> (13.) tells us, are meant, hereticks
in the Church, they ſhall be caſt from heaven; that is, out of the
Church: or elſe by Sun, Moon, and Stars, are meant the higher
powers in a State. So <hi>Jacob</hi> interprets his ſon <hi>Joſephs</hi> dream;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:117866:38"/>
but obſerve what <hi>John</hi> ſees: before the Vials be poured out, he
ſaw, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. a glaſſie ſea mingled with fire; The ſea in the Temple
was made of braſs, it was not to be ſeen through, onely they that
looked into it, ſaw what was in it; it typified the Jewiſh Church,
which onely were the people of God, and had the true worſhip
and knowledge of God; no other Nation were in covenant with
God but they, untill Chriſt came; the water in the ſea was a type
of Chriſts bloud, which was to other Nations conſpicuous. But
now in the Goſpel-Church here <hi>John</hi> ſees a glaſſe ſea with fire in
it, which may be beheld of all that come neer it, or ſtand afar off
it. <hi>John</hi> baptized with water, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> with the Holy Ghoſt
and fire; this Goſpel-Church now ſhall have abundance of ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
when the Witneſſes riſe; for thoſe that ſtand upon this glaſs
ſea, are the ſlain witneſſes who now are riſen again: they are they
that (after the Lord Jeſus hath reaped the Earth, as <hi>Habak.</hi> 3. 4, 5,
6. with his horns in his hand, with peſtilence and fire meaſuring
the Earth) are ſaid to have gotten the victory over the beaſt of
the Earth, and his Image; that is, his government, and his mark
and the number of his name; that is, over his Ingagement and
ſubtil-inſnaring ſtratagems; theſe ſing the ſong of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that is,
they ſing <hi>Hallelujah, Rev.</hi> 19. for the wonderful deliverance of the
Church out of great danger: they keep ſolemn and ſerious
Thankſgiving dayes to God, for reſtoring again their Church, and
State-Reformers.</p>
            <p>After that followes the ſeven Angels, who after the Temple
was open, went forth with great power, and <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. pour out the
Vials: to ſay directly, who theſe Angels are, or what the Vials
are, I dare not, for theſe things are to come, and have not been as
yet fulfilled.</p>
            <p>This, I think, may cleerly be made out, that the Beaſt of the
Earth ſhall be deſtroyed when the Witneſſes riſe, and then ſhall
follow all the Vials upon Rome, and the other Enemies of the
Church profeſſing Chriſtianity; for in all theſe Vials I do not
find a word that is applicable to the Turk, but onely to the Beaſt
of the Earth, the Beaſt of the Sea, and the Dragon, which are all
within the Church. 2. This alſo may be made out from what we
have ſaid, that the Vials ſhall all be poured out within a ſhort
ſpace of time; for if the Vials ſhall not be poured out untill An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:117866:38"/>
raign be accompliſhed, and before the Jews are convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
then they muſt be ſpeedily poured out, becauſe the Jews con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
immediatly follows the ruine of the Roman Monarchy:
therefore in <hi>Mat. 24. 29. after the Vials are poured out upon the
Roman Monarchy:</hi> then <hi>ver. 30. the Kindreds of the Earth ſhall
mourn.</hi> Such a mourning as <hi>Zachary</hi> ſpeaks of; <hi>They ſhall look
upon him whom they have pierced, and mourn over him.</hi> I conceive
Chriſt borrows that expreſſion, <hi>For here they ſhall ſee the ſign of the
Son of man, and mourn:</hi> and <hi>verſ. 31. and he ſhall ſend his Angel with
a ſound of a Trumpet,</hi> this is the ſeventh Trumpet, <hi>and they ſhall ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
together all his Elect from the four winds.</hi> The ſounding of
the Trumpet was a ſign, that ſome ſolemn day, or publick good
was at hand: the Phariſees therefore ſounded a Trumpet in the
Market-place, to proclaim the glad tidings of Almes to the poor;
but eſpecially (to which the Holy Ghoſt alludes) the joyful year
of Jubilee was proclaimed by ſound of Trumpet, which ſet the
ingaged free; ſo ſhall this ſeventh Trumpet proclaim the joyful
time of the Jews converſion and freedom, from all bondage ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
and temporal: As the ſeventh Trumpet blew down Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo
walls, which was the great city that hindered the Hebrews
from paſſing into <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſo the ſeventh Trumpet ſounding ſhall
blow down Rome, which hinders the Jews converſion to the
Goſpel: theſe very expreſſions you ſhall find in <hi>Eſai.</hi> 11. 12, 13,
14. which ſpeaks of the calling of the Jews in the end of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Monarchy. This is not (as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> thinks) ſpoken of
the day of Judgment; for that day Chriſt would not have us cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in ſearching after: but this Chriſt would have us diligently
to inquire after, and therefore gives us a parable from the Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,
to aſſure us, that by the precedent ſimptome, <hi>viz.</hi> of ſubtil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers,
and blaſphemous hereticks, and cruel perſecutors of the
true Church, we may as certainly conclude, that this day
drawes nigh, as we may be certain the Summers coming,
when we ſee the trees bud forth and bloſſome: Indeed <hi>v.</hi> 36. he
ſaith, that <hi>of that day and houre knoweth no man,</hi> but what day and
houre is that? 'Tis the day and houre of the heaven and earths
paſſing away, that is, of the day of Judgment, that the Angells
know not; but of the day of powring out the Vialls on Rome,
and on the enemies of the Church, and of the Jews converſion, I
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:117866:39"/>
am confident it is cleerly held out in Scripture.</p>
            <p>Having laid down theſe things, to prove that the Witneſſes ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
the Beaſts ruine, the Vialls powring out, and the Jews con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
ſhall be neer together: For a ſtronger confirmation, we
may bring two texts, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15. the ſeventh Trumpet ſounds, and
then the Vialls are powred out; there the ſeventh trumpet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
Romes ruine: and <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 7. when the ſeventh Angell ſhall
ſound, the myſtery of God ſhall be finiſhed, that is, the myſtery
that <hi>Paul</hi> would not have the Roman Church ignorant of, <hi>Rom.</hi>
11. 25. If this be meant of Gods work againſt Antichriſt, then the
ſeventh trumpet finiſheth, as well as begins Romes ruine: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
it with <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 17. The ſeventh Viall is powred into the
ayre, that is on the Devills kingdom, who is the Prince of the
ayre, for the ſeven Vialls are powred out, either on the earth,
that's the ſeat of the Beaſt of the Earth; or on the ſea; and rivers,
and Sun, and throne, that is, the Pontifick State, which hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſtrong holds and politick props to uphold it: the Sea, that is
the Eccleſiaſtick ſtate, that's the Popes place, on this the vials muſt
be powred, or els on the ayre, that's the Devills Kingdome: ſo
that the ſeven Vialls ſet forth the complete conqueſt that God
will make over all his enemies, which in <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. is more cleerly
deſcribed, where Chriſt goeth forth to battell againſt his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
The parties that fight this battell againſt Chriſt, are thoſe
that are under the Beaſt of the Earth; for <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 13, 14. thoſe
ten horns rule as Kings, but are not Kings, who with one conſent
give their power and authority unto the Beaſt. theſe ſhall fight
with the Lamb, and the Lamb ſhall overcome them; for he is the
<hi>Lord of lords,</hi> and <hi>King of kings,</hi> and they on his ſide, called, and
choſen, and faithfull: this Lamb is the ſame that fights the great
battell, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. for <hi>v.</hi> 16. he hath the ſame title of honor, the
<hi>King of kings</hi> and <hi>Lord of lords,</hi> that is, making good his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
which he hath made both to the Jews and Gentiles, he will
now make himſelf known by his name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> not only making,
but fulfilling promiſes; and, which is worth obſerving, here you
ſee Chriſt <hi>v.</hi> 15. treading the wine-preſſe of the fierceneſſe and
wrath of God almighty, as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 19. where when Chriſt
comes againſt the Beaſt of the Earth with his ſickle, he uſeth the
ſame expreſſion, to note, 'tis one and the ſame Beaſt both here
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:117866:39"/>
and there. In <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 19. there <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw the Beaſt, and the Kings
of the earth and their hoſts gathered together to make battell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him that ſate on the horſe, and againſt his army: it may be
this Beaſt is that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. which is the Beaſt of the Earth, <hi>Rev.</hi>
13. 11. and the Kings of the earth are thoſe ten horns, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 12.
which gave their power to the Beaſt, and <hi>v.</hi> 14. make war with
the Lamb: By Beaſt is meant the Beaſt of the Sea, who by his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries
and Polititians promotes a war, &amp; proſecutes it with all
vigor and malice againſt Chriſt and his faithfull people, and ſo
ſtirs up the Kings of the earth, to make war with them;
Obſerve, in this battell the Beaſt is taken, and with him that
falſe Prophet which deceived them that received the Beaſts
mark, and them that worſhipped his Image; theſe, in this battell
were both caſt alive into the lake that burnes with fire and
brimſtone, that is, deſtroyed with a terrible deſtruction: I cannot,
I dare not peremptorily ſay where this battel ſhall be fought, but
certainly it muſt be where the Witneſſes are ſlain, and where the
Beaſt of the Earth ſets up his new Government; for when the
victory was got, it was got over the Beaſt, and the image of the
Beaſt. And <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4. After this victory the Witneſſes that were
beheaded for Chriſts cauſe, the ſame Offices were exalted, and the
Miniſtery that ſuffered for not worſhipping the image, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
his mark, theſe alſo were exalted, therefore this battell
muſt be fought by the Witneſſes, Chriſt being the conqueror (for
in this battel the Lords mighty hand ſhall eminently appear) and
it muſt be fought againſt the Beaſt of the Earth, and his party:
now the Beaſt of the Earth hath ſet up his new government no
where but in <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Scotland:</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> he is
now endeavouring to ſet it up. That this great Battel, and the
Vials pouring forth are one and the ſame thing, to me is cleer.
Firſt, From the actors and parties on both ſides, who are the ſame
both in pouring out the Vialls, and fighting the Battel; and theſe
act at the ſame time for <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 5. When the Temple in heaven
was opened, then the Angels came forth in white linnen to pour
out their Vialls; and in <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 11. (where the great Battel is
fought) <hi>John</hi> ſaw Heaven opened, and Chriſt on a white horſe,
who <hi>(Rev.14. 14.)</hi> he ſaw in a white cloud, and his Army clothed
in white linnen, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 6. He treads the Vine-preſſes of Gods
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:117866:40"/>
fierce wrath by the <hi>ſword of his mouth, Rev.</hi> 19. 15. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 14,
20 he treads it with a ſharp ſickle: By all which 'tis apparent,
that neither the Vialls, nor this Battel, are to be fought untill the
Witneſſes put off their ſackcloth, and put on their white linnen;
and then by the ſame parties, at the ſame time, both are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed,
which indeed are both one and the ſame thing in action,
though ſeveral wayes expreſſed for the cleering of the thing to
the underſtanding of the Reader; For as the cutting down of the
Vine, and the preſſing of it in the Vine-preſs, notes the utter paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
away of the Vine and the Vintage: So doth that other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of caſting the Beaſt of the Earth into the Lake that burns
with fire and brimſtone, ſignifie his utter ruine: and this is cleer by
another argument, taken from the parties againſt which the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
is fought, and the Vialls are poured out, they are the ſelf-ſame
Enemies <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Beaſt of the Earth, the Beaſt of the Sea, and
the Prince of the Ayr, and their Kingdoms; theſe (as we have
ſhewed already, are the Objects of the Vialls, and the Enemies
which Chriſt overcomes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 19, 20. &amp; <hi>Rev. 20. 3.)</hi> are the Beaſt
of the Sea, the falſe prophet which is the Beaſt of the Earth, and
the Prince of the Ayr, which is called the Dragon, the old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;
now they are at one time alſo, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 16. when the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
come to <hi>Harmaggaddan</hi> to battel, then the ſeven Vials, which
is the final wrath of God, goe forth in thundering, and voices,
and earth-quakes; and the great victory is expreſſed, by caſting
alive, both the Beaſt and the falſe Prophet, into the burning Lake,
and chaining the Devil in Hell 1000 years.</p>
            <p>This great Battel cannot be fought before nor after the Vialls
be poured out, <hi>ergo,</hi> they muſt be both at one time.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Not before the vials be powred forth, becauſe this great
Battel utterly confounds theſe three chief Enemies of the church;
the Devil who ſets up the Pope, who keeps the Witneſſes in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth;
and the Pope who ſets up the Beaſt of the Earth, who
ſlays the Witneſſes; and the Beaſt of the Earth who doth uphold
the Popes and the Devils Kingdom: Therefore I conceive the
great Battel ſhall be fought againſt him, in whoſe ruine the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and the Popes Kingdom ſhall be overthrown; and that's the
reaſon, I conceive, why after this great Battel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 20. 'tis ſaid
that the Beaſt, that is, the Pope was taken, when onely the falſe
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:117866:40"/>
Prophet ſought in perſon, and was ruined: becauſe in the falſe
Prophets (who is the Beaſt of the Earth) cauſe the Pope is moſt
nearly concerned. Farewell Popery in theſe three Kingdoms for
ever, when once the Beaſt of the Earth goeth to ruine: all the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
ſhall be in force then againſt Popery, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are now repealed,
<hi>Eſa.</hi> 59. 18. This is the day of repaying vengeance to thoſe Iſlands;
the Pope ſhall be utterly ruined in <hi>Scotland, England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi>
but now if theſe Enemies ſhould be deſtroyed before the Vialls
be powred out, then Vialls muſt be powred out in vain, for
theſe three are the onely Enemies of the Church; and when they
are overcome, there are none to ſtand againſt the Church; the
reſt ſhall fear, and give glory to God.</p>
            <p>I do not believe, for my part, that the Turk ſhall be deſtroyed
by the ſword, <hi>non credo quia non lego</hi> (as <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith) I do
not find it any where in Scripture, that they ſhall be deſtroyed
by the ſword, unleſs they be put under the Devils Banners (as
well they may) and ſo be deſtroyed with the Devil: But my
hope is, that their Religion onely ſhall be deſtroyed, and they
brought in by a mighty converſion to the Goſpel: my reaſon is,
becauſe both the <hi>Hebrecians</hi> and <hi>Grecians</hi> are inſlaved moſt to the
Pope in ſpiritual thraldom: therefore the Pope is called both
<hi>Abaddon</hi> and <hi>Apallion:</hi> now when the Pope ſhall be ruined, both
Jews and Gentiles ſhall come in to Chriſt with more glory and
fulneſs then ever, which may be in the deſtruction of the Weſtern
Antichriſtian Gentiles; but not in the Eaſtern Gentiles deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
but glorious converſion. A remnant onely of the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Faction ſhall be converted, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 13.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This Battel cannot be fought after the Vialls are
powred out, for the Vials produce the utter ruine of the Enemies
of the Church: Now if the Battel ſhould be after the Enemies of
the Church are overthrown, it muſt neceſſarily be a Battel with
the Ayr, (as we ſay) there are no Enemies to be ſubdued; all's
finiſhed when the Vials are powred out: Therefore by neceſſary
conſequence it is cleer, that the great Battel, and the Vials, are one
and the ſame thing. Now then put all together, if the Vials and
the Battel be the ſame, and this Battel muſt be fought by the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
and their Army, with whom Chriſt by his mighty power
will eminently go forth: (for in no other ſence is Chriſt coming
on a white horſe to be taken) and theſe muſt appear in fine and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:117866:41"/>
white linnen, which is contrary to ſackcloth which in till then,
they were, and at this Battel the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet, and
the Dragon, muſt be ruined.</p>
            <p>Then I prove that this Battel is not far off, and that from the
Doctors own calculations in his Thankſgiving Sermon: There
he proves to my hand from <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 5. that Antichriſt began his
42 Moneths Raign, which makes up 1260 years; which is the time
of the Witneſſes abiding in the Wilderneſs, and in Sackcloth:
Now (ſaith he) Antichriſt began to work and act vigorouſly about
the year 390 after Chriſt; I do believe this of the Doctors to be
a reall truth; and for confirmation of the ſame, I will add one
word or two.</p>
            <p>I do affirm, that about that year, 390. the Biſhop of Rome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be formally Antichriſt; for then they began to claim an
independent power as unto the Magiſtracy and Miniſtery: He
claimed a priviledge of being exempted from the cenſures of
Councels, as being above them; for he made the Eaſtern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
but his Sons, and he their Father; and Sons have not power
to cenſure their Father: and then they began to overlook Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
to excommunicate them, to depoſe them, and to free
themſelves from their cenſures. Hereupon the Magiſtracy and
Miniſtery were in a ſhort time brought under the Popes feet, and
made to wear ſackcloth, and then the Church fled into the place
prepared of God for her, <hi>Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> 12. 6. which place is <hi>England,</hi> as
ſhall be proved.</p>
            <p>The Devils ſtratagems of ſetting up Independency in the
Chair of Rome, was the Key of the bottomleſs pit which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
put into the Popes hands: and it is indeed the <hi>formalis ratio
Antichriſti;</hi> for Independency ſet the Biſhops of Rome above
Magiſtracy and above Miniſtery; above mans Law, and above
Scriptures; and Gods Law, as their <hi>Decretals</hi> manifeſt: therefore
<hi>Paul 2 Theſſ.</hi> 2. ſets him out to the life, <hi>ver. 4. He oppoſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
above all that is called God, above every Magiſtrate; and then
he, as God, ſits in the Temple of God,</hi> that is, <hi>in the Church of God;</hi>
for Rome was for a long time the pureſt Church: Now in this
Church the Independent Prelate ſits as God, making Laws like a
God: None but God hath an Independent power, but the
Pope he takes upon him an Independent liberty, and authority
and priviledge of himſelf; and by himſelf alone, and without any
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:117866:41"/>
other, he takes upon him to alter Scripture, add to Scripture, and
detract from it: in this he ſets himſelf even above God, and ſo is
the true Antichriſt. Now this Independent power, the Biſhop
of Rome began to put in practice about the year 390. to which
add the juſt meaſure of the time of this Antichriſts raign, which is
1260 years, and it makes compleatly 1650.</p>
            <p>The other pertinent place which the Doctor alledgeth is, <hi>Dan.
12. 11. from the time the daily ſacrifice ſhall be taken away, there ſhall
be 1290 dayes,</hi> (that is years) now about the year 360. that deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
abomination of ruining their Temples foundation, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
their Altars, and deſtroying their Sacrifices, and burning
their Utenſels, and ſo putting to an end their Sacrifices, began:
now add to 360. 1290. and it makes 1650. Now this year 1650.
(ſaith the Doctor) muſt be the great year of doing great things
againſt Antichriſt, <hi>pag.</hi> 17. He calls wiſe men to conſider, how
here in <hi>England</hi> there hath been a King bound, and ſome Nobles,
(he means beheaded) and how Kingdoms have been changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Common-wealths; and how <hi>Scotland</hi> hath been beaten over
and over, he leaves wiſe men to conſider, whether theſe are not
high acts of throwing down Antichriſt: Theſe acts he calleth <hi>pag.
18.)</hi> the making good of his Doctrine; and upon that account,
exhorts the people to praiſe God, for cutting off the King, and
throwing down the Houſe of Lords; and from <hi>pag.</hi> 25. to <hi>pag.</hi> 27.
or thereabouts, he ſets up a tone of rayling in the moſt
ridiculouſeſt ſtyle, and weakeſt way of arguing againſt the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
of <hi>England,</hi> for not keeping the Thankſgiving day, that I
am aſhamed our Engliſh Nation ſhould be ſo much diſgraced, as
to have the Title of Doctor ſet before it. In <hi>pag.</hi> 32. he tells the
Lord Major, and the reſt of the Companies, That they muſt not
onely as Saints give thanks; but as people conſidered in oppoſite
diſtinction to Kings, Monarchy being turned into Democracy,
Kingdoms into Common-wealths. This Democracie he highly
commends, and in the ſame page with a Whores (or rather with
a Whore-maſters) fore-head, affirms this moſt andacious and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
untruth, That this government was anciently among the
Jews in the time of the Judges: I have already proved this
Doctor to be a Teacher of falſe Doctrines; therefore I paſs by
theſe things, onely I would intreat the Reader to take notice
how under the pretence of crying down Antichriſt, there are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:117866:42"/>
deceivers not onely crept in, but ruſhed in; and by authority
maintained, allowed, and uſhered in, to depreſs and deſtroy the
true Saints and Church of God, by ſtigmatizing them with the
mark of Antichriſtianiſm, and to exalt and extoll the actors and
actions of theſe whoſe deſign is wholly to exalt Antichriſt: Was
it ever heard before, that Proteſtants made a day of rejoycing for
the fall of a Proteſtant Nation, and a Proteſtant King? Who truly
rejoyceth at this but Rome, and the Romiſh Factors? Il'e ſay
no more to this, but return to the Doctors Calculations; and out
of his own mouth, by Gods grace, I hope to make it cleer, that
what he calls the throwing down of Antichriſt, is the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aying of
the Witneſſes; and theſe which he calls the Saints, and Holy
Ones, are they that are the ſlayers of the Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>The Doctor is ſtrongly conceited, that this year 1650. ſhall be
a year of terrible things againſt Rome: his grounds for it are
plauſible, I do confeſs it, and I am upon the ſame grounds as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
as he, That Rome ſhall have a fatall blow immediatly after
this year: I know many are ready to laugh at this opinion, and
ſay, Was Rome ever in greater pomp then now? When did
ever Rome's Deſigns proſper more then now throughout Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope?
Is it not a year of Jubilee, a year of feaſting and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
with Rome, how then can it be imagined, that Rome ſhould
have a fatal blow about this year? To this I anſwer briefly,
Rome's proſperity is that great Sumptome of her ruine; for <hi>Rev.</hi>
18. 7. Her ruine ſhall come in that day that ſhe thought her ſelf
moſt ſecure, <hi>How much ſhe hath gloried her ſelf, and lived deliciouſly,
ſo much torment give her; for ſhe ſaith in her heart, I ſit a Queen, and
am no Widow, and ſhall ſee no ſorrow. Therefore ſhall her plagues come
in one day, death, and mourning, and famine, and ſhe ſhall be utterly
burnt with fire.</hi> In theſe two verſes the Holy Ghoſt uſeth this as
a ſtrong Argument, to perſwade us, that Rome's ruine ſhall be
when the World leaſt expects it. Obſerve what the Lovers of
Rome ſay in <hi>verſ. 9, 10. They ſhall weep, and cry, Alas! Alas!
thou great City, for in one hour is thy judgment come.</hi> By all which
'tis manifeſt, that Rome's ruine ſhall be ſuddain, and unexpected;
and therefore 'tis an argument, that Rome's ruine is nigh, becauſe
of her pomp and great proſperity. I'le bring another proof
for it in <hi>Rev. 11. 9, 10. It ſhall be a time of merry making and feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:117866:42"/>
I am almoſt perſwaded that the Holy Ghoſt points at the
year of Jubilee that is now at Rome, to note to us, That when the
ſlain Witneſſes ſhall be dead in the ſtreets, and unburied, then
Rome ſhall keep a year of feaſting and rejoycing; which year of
feaſting, is this preſent year, 1650. Now they are making merry,
that a Proteſtant Parliament, a Proteſtant King, and a Proteſtant
Miniſtery, are overthrown: but mark what follows on a ſuddain,
thoſe Witneſſes, that Proteſtant Magiſtracy, and Proteſtant Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery,
ſtand on their feet, and then comes the Earth-quake,
which ſhakes their Enemies to the ground: So that the day of
Rome's rejoycing doth but uſher in Rome's ruine: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
proſperity and ſucceſs ſo much cryed up by this Antichriſtian
Doctor, is an argument, to me, of their ſpeedy ruine. Would but
the Doctor read <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 7, 15. wiſely, he might ſee himſelf with
ſhame, acting the part of one of Antichriſts Miniſters: I perceive
he knows well that Antichriſts raign is neer at an end; he that
knows that, cannot (if he ſearch diligently) but ſee in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 7.
that three years and an half before the Pope's ruine, a Beaſt ſhall
ariſe, and ſlay the Witneſſes that have finiſhed their Teſtimony,
that is, a godly Magiſtracy and Miniſtery; when they had agreed
to root out Popery, and eſtabliſh uniformity in Doctrine, Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
and government, this Beaſt that doth theſe things againſt
the Witneſſes, he cannot but ſee is he that riſeth after the ten
Kings ſubject to Rome: he riſeth (ſay Interpreters) in the end
of the Roman Monarchy, and throwes down three of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and changes lawes, and times, and wears out the Saints,
three years and an half, the ſelf-ſame that ſlayes the Winteſſes,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 7. and after that he and his crew keep thankſgiving days,
that they that hindered them in their deſignes (they ſay obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
juſtice) are removed, one of this crew, and one of theſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian
Beaſts the Doctor proves himſelf. This Beaſt, I have
already proved, is an Independent, and pulls down the lawfull
Magiſtracy and Miniſtery, and ſets up his own Preachers, and his
own government: We have ſhewed his government in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.
and in <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 37. 'tis the god <hi>Mauzim,</hi> that is, a government
that he ſets up by the power of his ſword, a ſword force: Now
I prove that this power of forces was ſet up in or about Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in the year 1647. for then did the Beaſt of the Earth
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:117866:43"/>
get the Navie into his hands, and all the Land Forces
throughout the Kingdom, either to disband them, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them; he got all the ſtrong Holds and Caſtles in the
Kingdom under his command; and about the ſame time he laid
violent hands on the Kings Maj. and clapped his royal perſon up
in priſon, ſuffering no man to come neere him; and about that
time made an aſſault upon the Parl. impriſoned ſome of the Peers,
ſome of the chief Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> and ſome of the Houſe
of Commons, inforcing others of the moſt noble of the Houſe
of Commons to flie, and ſet up his own ingaged Party in the
Houſe, to over-top the others: Here began the Beaſt to reign,
and here began the ſlaughter of the Witneſſes, all which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
September or October 1647. By which account we ſhall
bring it almoſt even with the Doctors, that this Beaſt that riſeth
out of the bottomleſſe pit, and ſlayes the Witneſſes, the time of
his reigne muſt be conſummate ſoon after the end of this yeare
1650. for then his three years reign is up, and then the time of
the Witneſſes lying ſlain is up, and then they muſt riſe, and then
the Vialls muſt be poured out, and the earthquake will come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the enemies, and then the Beaſt and the falſe Prophet ſhall be
caſt alive into the burning lake.</p>
            <p>I verily believe that we are near to that prophetick great day
propheſied of in the old Teſtament: In the old Teſtament
'tis called a great Day, and ſo 'tis called in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 16. the battell againſt the enemies of the Church is
called <hi>the battell of the great day of God almighty,</hi> that is, of the
great year of God; God will do great things for the Hebrews
this year, both for the ten Tribes, and the two Tribes. Great
things will he do for the Gentiles this year, and terrible great
things will he do againſt his enemies. This day is called <hi>Hoſ. 1. 10.
the great day,</hi> What day is that? the Context tells us, 'tis the
day of the converſion of both Tribes, and uniting them under
Chriſt. In <hi>Obadiah</hi> 15. 'tis called <hi>the day of the Lord upon all the
heathen:</hi> God will plague the enemies of the Church, <hi>verſe</hi>
16. but <hi>verſe 17. on mount Sion ſhall be deliverance,</hi> to note
this day is the day of rendring vengeance on <hi>Rome, Rev.</hi> 18. and
of ſaving mount Sion, deliverance ſhall be there, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 1. for
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:117866:43"/>
the Lamb ſtands on <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> and all his ſealed Ones with
him: in <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. (for I can multiply proofes from every one of
the Prophets which illuſtrate this day) I mean to ſit down and
give the Reader a view of this Day of the year 1650. by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
and my account, as <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. deſcribes it, he gives us a full
view of this Day: He calls it the Day of the Lord, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. But
what ſhall be done in that day? in general the ſpoil (meaning the
Churches ſpoyl) ſhould be divided in the midſt of her, <hi>ver. 2. For I
will gather all Nations againſt</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>to battel, and the City ſhall
be taken, and the houſes rifled, and the women raviſhed, and half of the
City ſhall go forth into captivity, and the reſidue of the people ſhall not
be cut off from the City.</hi> Here is a particular Narration of the
Churches affliction in this day: This muſt be underſtood (ſaith
<hi>Diodate)</hi> of the ſpirituall and corporall Wars which Antichriſt
ſhall make againſt the Church. I do believe this Expoſition to
be really true; for as he ſaith, God ſhall ſuffer a great part of his
Church to be diſcomfited and ſubdued, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 7. as <hi>Diodate</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
in his <hi>Annotations,</hi> ſo on this text he is moſt excellent: for
he turns us to the right place, to find out the Enemy, that afflicts
the Church with this ſore affliction; and that is in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 7. the
Beaſt that ſlays the Witneſſes; &amp; <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 25. wears out the Saints;
he makes war with them, and overcomes them; <hi>Cornelius è Lapide,</hi>
in one ſenſe, underſtands this in <hi>Zachary,</hi> of Antichriſts tyranny
over the Church: ſo that this verſe gives a deſcription of the
Beaſts tyranny that ſlayes the Witneſſes: Indeed ſome of the
Rabbins underſtand it literally of <hi>Antiochus</hi> rifling <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi>
but their <gap reason="foreign">

falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets ſhall deceive many, the Church of
God ſhall be miſerably torn, as a City taken by ſtorm; but what

            <p>This is that day which the Church of the Jews, I mean the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Jews, longed to ſee. Theſe feet of Chriſts <hi>Solomon</hi> in his Song
commends, and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 7. There the Church admiring, ſaith; <hi>How
beautiful upon the Mountains are the feet of him that bringeth glad
tydings;</hi> that is, <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I conceive by <hi>feet,</hi> are meant the Witneſſes, which <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 1, 2.
are called Chriſts right foot, and left foot; for they are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
that Chriſt makes uſe of for the propagating the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
It cannot be meant literally of Chriſts feet, but of a godly
Magiſtracy and Miniſtery, which the Lord ſhall eminently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,
<hi>Rev. 11. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> by reſtoring them to that condition they were
in when they finiſhed their Teſtimony, immediatly before the
Beaſt of the Earth ſlew them; yea to a far higher ſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:117866:44"/>
God ſhall ſet the Magiſtracy in the Throne again, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
in their places again; they ſhall ſtand on their feet again;
they ſhall be higher in power and greatneſs then ever they were:
therefore <hi>ver.</hi> 12. they are ſaid to be called up to Heaven. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve;
as the Beaſt that ſlew the Witneſſes and his party, brought
the Witneſſes into as much diſgrace as might be, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. in not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
their dead bodies to be buried; that is, uſing them with the
higheſt acts of inſulting cruelty: For the expreſſion (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
is taken from inſulting Warriours, whom in a vaporing
bravado, to ſhew how much they diſdain their Enemy, and how
baſely they eſteem of him, tell him, they'l give his body to the
Fowls of the Ayr; that is, diſdain to give him the honour of a
burial; thou ſhalt die as a Dog. In the great Duel fought betwixt
<hi>David</hi> and <hi>Goliah</hi> before they fought, you ſhall find theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting
expreſſions proceeding from each of them to the other,
in the 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 44. ſaid the <hi>Philiſtin</hi> to <hi>David, Come to me, I
will give thy fleſh to the Fowls of the Ayr, and the Beaſts of the
Field.</hi> The ſelf-ſame ſaith <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Goliah, ver.</hi> 46. They could
not throw more indignominious expreſſions into the face of
each other then theſe: Now this is practiſed againſt the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
by the Beaſt and his party that ſlayes them: but as their
cruelty towards them is exceeding, ſo ſhall their honour in their
exaltation be exceeding; and their enemies repayed with the
ſame ignominy and reproach, <hi>Rev. 18. 6. Reward her as ſhe hath
rewarded you:</hi> How is that? Why he gave their carcaſſes to the
Fowls of the Ayr; and the Witneſſes muſt now give the Beaſt
and his Army's carcaſſes to the Fowls of the Ayr: and therefore,
<hi>Rev. 19. 11. When Chriſt rides on his white horſe,</hi> and <hi>ver. 14. his
Army followes him on white horſes</hi> (theſe are the Witneſſes riſen)
and when the Kings of the Earth and their Armies gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(as in <hi>Zech.</hi> 14. 2. they do; for 'tis one and the ſame battel)
then Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 18. calls the Fowls to a great Supper, even to
the carcaſſes of his Enemies. Here Chriſt payes them home in
their own coyn; they would not ſuffer the Witneſſes to be laid
in grave, and God will not ſuffer them to be put in grave, for the
Fowls ſhall eat them: this Battel in <hi>Zech.</hi> 14. 3. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. is one
and the ſame, becauſe 'tis fought by the ſame perſon Chriſt, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:117866:45"/>
the ſame Army, and in the ſame place, and at the ſame time as we
ſhall make manifeſt.</p>
            <p>This battel ſhall be fought when Chriſts feet ſtand on <hi>Mount
Olivet:</hi> the great queſtion is, What is meant by <hi>Mount Olivet,</hi> or
the <hi>Mount of Olives?</hi> Take it literaly, it was a Mount which
ſtood on the Eaſt ſide of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> which for the goodly Olives,
and the plenty of Olives, that it yielded, it was called <hi>Mount
Olivet:</hi> This was the place of Chriſts delight; there he was moſt
converſant; there he preached, and there he uſually reſorted to
pray: No Mountain in the world had ſo much of Chriſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and his Ordinances, as this Mountain: there Judas betrayed
him and his Diſciples; there Chriſt appeared again after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection;
his feet ſtood on <hi>Mount Olives</hi> before he aſcended up
into glory: there he aſcended into Heaven in the ſight of thoſe
that crucified him; for that Mount looked into the ſtreets of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,
and they in Jeruſalem could plainly ſee the Mount of
Olives.</p>
            <p>Hence judicious-learned Interpreters conclude, that by Mount
Olives, in the Prophets ſenſe, is meant the Church of Chriſt,
where the Ordinances of Chriſt are purely, frequently, and
powerfully taught; and where ſubmiſſion to Chriſt, as Lord and
King, is yielded.</p>
            <p>Upon this ground, <hi>Martinus</hi> applye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s this expreſſion of the
Prophets to the Church of Rome, affirming <hi>Mount Olivet</hi> to be
the Church of Rome: <hi>quia ad pedis Christi ſeipſos ſubjiciunt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they ſubject themſelves to Chriſt: For Oyl (ſay the learned)
is an hierogliphick of ſubmiſſion and ſubjection. <hi>Ambros,</hi> in <hi>Luke</hi>
21. expounds <hi>Mount Olivet</hi> to be the Church: Some of the higheſt
and chiefeſt of the Independents of this age, are of the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
and therefore do not ſtick to ſay; that <hi>Mount Olivet</hi> is <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which is the moſt delightfulleſt place for Ordinances in the
World.</p>
            <p>Since the Romaniſt and Independent agree, and will have it
ſo, it will be treaſon to gain-ſay them; wee'll therefore comply
as much as may be: For my own part I do believe, that by <hi>Mount
Olivet,</hi> is meant ſome eminent delightful place in <hi>Europe,</hi> famou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
above other places, for Religion, for Doctrine, for Diſcipline, and
Government, and for eminent Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:117866:45"/>
I do believe it is meant that place where one (like <hi>Judas)</hi> both
a Thief and a Traytor, and an Apoſtate, and a deceitful Hypocrite,
riſeth up with his armed men, and with a kiſs, of pretending to
exalt Chriſt, and promote the intereſt of Saints, betrays the cauſe
of God, and the chief Inſtruments of a Reformation, into the
hands of the High Prieſt of Rome, who by his inſtruments cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifies
them.</p>
            <p>2. I believe it is the place whereas Chriſt was betrayed, ſo
there he ſhall riſe again; for Chriſts feet, after his reſurrection,
were ſeen ſtanding on <hi>Mount Olivet:</hi> ſo I do believe the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
that this Judas-like fellow ſhall betray to death, ſhall riſe
again in the ſame kingdom or place; there they ſhall ſtand on
their feet, and be called up to Heaven, that is, to high promotion,
far above the reach of their Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I conceive this Mount, and that in</hi> Rev. 16. 16. <hi>are one and the
ſame: for</hi> Harmagedon <hi>(ſaith</hi> Brightman) <hi>ſignifies a Mountain of
delight: the ſame (ſaith he) in</hi> Dan. 11. 45. The enemy that goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Church, ſhall pitch his Tents in the glorious holy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
<hi>or, as in the Original,</hi> in the Mountain of delights of Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Theſe expreſſions of the Holy Ghoſt, in theſe ſeveral places, ſet
forth one and the ſame thing to us, if we view but the ſcope of
all: for in all three places, 'tis one and the ſame Enemy going
forth to battel againſt the Lord Jeſus in one and the ſame place,
and at one and the ſame time, and produceth one and the ſame
effects; for in <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. the Enemy goeth to utter ruine by the
coming of Chriſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 1. &amp; <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 16. that battel produceth
the ſeventh Viall which finiſheth all; and in <hi>Zach. 14. 3. Chriſt ſhall
fight in that day, as when he fought in the day of battel:</hi> when ever
Chriſt fought a battel he ruined his Enemies; ſo will he here, as
in <hi>Judg. 7. Eſay</hi> 9. 4. Now if the Romaniſts and Independents
will give me leave to joyn <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> once united (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed
be he that was the cauſe of their ſeparation) I will comply
with them, and conclude, that theſe two Kingdoms are the <hi>Mount
of Olives,</hi> where Chriſts feet ſhall ſtand in the day of battel; 'tis
that place where the Witneſſes were betrayed and ſlain, and that
place, where, in the ſight of their Enemies they ſhall aſcend to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:117866:46"/>
Heaven; that is, be eminently exalted above their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>V.</hi> 4. And his feet ſhall stand in that day on the Mount of Olives,
which is before <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> on the East, and the Mount of Olives
ſhall cleave in the midſt thereof towards the Eaſt, and towards the
West, a very great valley; and half of the Mountain ſhall remove to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the North, and half the Mountain toward the South, in that
day; <hi>that is,</hi> the day that the ſpoil is divided in <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and the
Gentiles gather against <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to battel, the ſame day that the
Beaſt makes war with the Saints, and overcomes them, <hi>Rev. 11. 7. and
Dan.</hi> 7. 25. and when they ſhall gather together to <hi>Harmageddon,
Rev.</hi> 16. 16. and when he pitcheth his Tents in the Mountain of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
of holineſſe, <hi>Dan. 11. 45. In this day ſhall be theſe great
things done as followeth:</hi> The Mount of Olives ſhall cleave in the
midſt thereof, towards the Eaſt, and the Weſt, a great valley.</p>
            <p>Note, This is ſpoken of the laſt years raign of the Beaſt of the
Earth; and therefore 'tis called one day, a prophetick day, which
ſignifies one year: For this verſe ſets forth the great Rent that
ſhall be made by the Beaſt of the Earth, amongſt thoſe that were
formerly united under one King, and in one Faith, and locked
faſt together in one Covenant: amongſt theſe there ſhall be a
breach in the laſt year of the Beaſt of the Earths raign. The <hi>Mount
of Olives ſhall cleave in the midst thereof.</hi> Here is the great ſign
fore-going the great battell, wherein Chriſt will appear on his
Churches ſide: <hi>the half of the Mount of Olives ſhall remove to the
North, and half to the South.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerve here, there was a Union before the North and the
South was united; and now they are divided, the Mount of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lives
is divided; but one delightful Mountain in the World, and
that divided! this is terrible. A great diviſion in the Church
of God: thoſe that were united in one covenant ſhall be broken
and divided; inſomuch that Sermons ſhall claſh againſt Sermons,
and prayers againſt prayers, and Faſt dayes againſt Faſt-dayes: it
ſhall be a vaſt breach, for there ſhall be a Valley towards the Eaſt
and the Weſt. The Chaldee renders it, <hi>a very great Valley:</hi> and
the Septuagint read it, <hi>a very great Gulf:</hi> ſo that the North can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
paſſe to the South; nor the South to the North: There ſhall
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:117866:46"/>
be an irreconcileable breach made betwixt them; they ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
any commerce or trade with them; they ſhall be at as great
diſtance in Opinion, Judgment, and practice, as the Covenant is at
a diſtance from the Engagement, or the Engagement from the
Covenant.</p>
            <p>Covenanters cannot paſs to the Engagers without perjury,
and the Engagers cannot paſs to Covenanters without forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their allegeance to their acknowledged Maſters.</p>
            <p>This, I conceive, is the Valley that ſhall be made towards the
Eaſt and Weſt, which muſt needs be Eaſtward and Weſtward
when the Mount is divided; and half removes towards the
North, the other towards the South.</p>
            <p>The Fathers, many of them, miſ-interpreting this text, by giving
a bare literal explication of the words, differ therefore in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication:
ſome apply this text to <hi>Titus,</hi> and his Army's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits
upon Mount Olivet. Others faign, that 'twas then when
God with his Angels fought for the <hi>Maccabees</hi> on that Mount
againſt <hi>Antioches.</hi> Others think that 'twas then fulfilled, when
<hi>Constantine</hi> fought againſt the <hi>Arrians;</hi> at which time, on this
hill, the ſign of the croſs appeared.</p>
            <p>Hence (it may be) <hi>Theodoretus</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> conceive, that this
hill was divided into four parts like a croſs; but theſe have but
fabulous grounds for their opinion. <hi>Zanche, Vatable, Lycanus,</hi> and
many others, ſay 'twas divided but into two parts; but I humbly
conceive, that in a literal ſenſe, Mount Olivet was never divided
into two.</p>
            <p>Therefore the text is not to be underſtood literally, but figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively,
and parabolically under theſe tearms and Expoſitions,
ſetting forth ſome eminent place in the world, which is eminent
for holineſs and unity in Doctrine, and Government, but unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly
rent, and miſerably divided into two grand parties,
which ſhall be at ſo great and vaſt a diſtance in opinion and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
as 'tis impoſſible to reconcile them one to the other: the
one ſhall ſwear to maintain King, Lords, and Commons; and
the other ſhall ſwear to ſuppreſs King and Lords: the one ſhall
ſwear to maintain true Religion in Doctrine, Diſcipline, and
Worſhip, and the other ſhall practice the deſtruction of Religion
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:117866:47"/>
in Doctrine, Diſcipline, and Worſhip, by a toleration of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
and ſupporting Popery; by taking away all Oaths offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
to Popiſh Tenents, and all Statutes offenſive to their perſons
and eſtates, and ſtriving to deſtroy ſound ſtedfaſt principled Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
by impoſing Oaths upon them againſt their conſciences,
and by taking away their priviledge of the Law from them, ſo
laying them open to all manner of miſery.</p>
            <p>By this you may ſee I am ſtrongly induced to believe that the
Mount of Olives is <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> formerly united under
one King and Religion, and under one ſolemn League and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
            <p>That part of the mountain divided to the North, I conceive, is
<hi>Scotland;</hi> That part to the South I conceive (according to its
ſituation from <hi>Scotland)</hi> is <hi>England:</hi> betwixt theſe there ſhall be
a great Gulf; a Gulf betwixt their principles, ſo deep and wide,
that all the World ſhall take notice of it.</p>
            <p>If any man ſhould doubt of <hi>Scotland</hi> being part of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Holineſs, in regard of the baſe reproaches of late caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, I'le deſire that man to read Mr. <hi>Jeremiah Burroughs</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in a ſpeech made at Guildhall, <hi>London, Octob.</hi> 6.
1643.</p>
            <p>Scotland, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> is a Kingdom beloved and honoured of God, by
whom God will do great things in the latter Age of the World; 'tis
a <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> 'tis more deeply ingaged to God then any Nation in
the World by Covenant, 'tis the most reformed Nation under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
'tis the greateſt Enemy to Antichriſt in the World, and the
moſt ſucceſſefull, with whom God hath moſt eminently appeared: they
are exceeding wiſe, exceeding juſt, and full of Chriſtian love. <hi>This
was Mr.</hi> Jeremiah Burrough's <hi>opinion of the Kingdom of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
<hi>and if he ſay it, I hope honeſt</hi> Independents <hi>(if there be any)
will believe it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>V.</hi> 5. And ye ſhall flee into the Valley of the Mountain, for the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
of the Mountain ſhall reach unto <hi>Azal;</hi> yea, ye ſhall flee like as ye
fled from the Earth-quake in the dayes of <hi>Uzziah</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi>
and the Lord my God ſhall come, and all the Saints with thee. <hi>This

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:117866:47"/>
then for fear of the commotions which in this age ſhall come, and</hi>
ye ſhall flee into my Mountains. <hi>So</hi> Hierom <hi>reades it.</hi> For the
Valley of the Mountain ſhall reach unto <hi>Azal. Many of the
ancient Interpreters read</hi> Azal <hi>as a proper name, and ſo paſs it

That ye may flee into the Valley which lieth betwixt</hi> Moriah <hi>and</hi>

So that the plain ſenſe of the text ſeems to be this,
Ye ſhall flee into the Valley of my Mountains, that is, Yea that are
the ſealed ones of the Lamb, that refuſe to worſhip the Beaſt, or
his Image, or receive his mark, that is, ſubſcribe his Ingagement;
Ye ſhall flee into the Valley of my Mountains, that is, that place
or Nation which keeps my Covenant, and obſerves my ſtatutes to
do them, there God will dwell where his Laws are obſerved, and
his Ordinances maintained in purity: but that Nation onely in
the World, this day, is <hi>Scotland:</hi> and the reaſon why God will
have them to fly to his Mountains, is in the next words, <hi>For the
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alley of the Mountain ſhall reach unto</hi> Azal, that is, The breach
betwixt the two Kingdoms ſhall reach unto a ſeparation: It
ſhall ſeparate true Subjects from Traytors, ſincere Profeſſors of
Religion from Apoſtates and Hypocrites, Covenant-keepers
from Covenant-breakers, Sheep from Goats: Thus the breach
betwixt the Kingdoms ſhall make a ſeparation in Perſons, in
Prayers, in Sermons; in every thing there ſhall be a ſeparation. In
<hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 27. the Church prayes thus, <hi>Return my well-beloved, and be
like a Roe, or a young Hart, upon the Mountains of Bether:</hi> this word
<hi>[Bether]</hi> ſeems to match <hi>[Azal.]</hi> for <hi>Bether</hi> ſignifies a ſeparation
or diviſion: Now on a Mountain of Separation the Church Praies
Chriſt to appear: it ſeems to me a prayer made for this day, for
<hi>verſe</hi> 4. 'Tis when the Jews that are obſcured ſhall be converted,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:117866:48"/>
and <hi>ver.</hi> 15. when Herericks ſhall ſpoil the Church; then in ſuch a
ſtraight the Church prayes that on the Mountains of <hi>Bether,</hi> that
is, In the divided diſtracted Kingdoms he would appear for the
Churches deliverance: it ſhall be a time of flying, a time of hot
perſecution; but the onely place for ſafety for the Saints, will be
the Valley of Gods Mountains <hi>[ye ſhall flee]</hi> is either Gods ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
to the people that are on the South part of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
to flee into the North part of the Mountain, aſſuring them,
that in that Kingdom onely ſafety will be found for the Saints.
Or elſe 'tis ſpoken by way of diſcrimination, to ſhew which way
the true Saints of God will take: They will flee in their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the other ſide; they will be on the Covenant ſide, and on
their ſide which keeps Gods Ordinances pure, and reſolve to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to their Covenant: you ſhall in this day know a Saint by his
prayers, and his faſting, and his thankſgiving. A true Saint will
die rather die then keep a day of rejoycing for the overthrow of
the Saints: but the other party that ſlay the Witneſſes, 'tis their
duty, they owe it to the Devil: therefore <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. they ſend gifts
one to another, and make merry, and why? Becauſe they that
would have proſecuted the ends of the Covenanted-Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are overthrown: Nothing but a ſincere Reformation is a
terrour to Apoſtates, Hypocrites, and carnal profeſſors: but now
they being overthrown, the Ingagers, the Worſhippers of the
Beaſt, make merry and ſend gifts one to another, that is, keep
Thankſgiving days.</p>
            <p>But you may know a true Saint, he abhors it; he mournes and
covers his face with ſackcloth; he flies in his prayers to the other
ſide of the Valley, to the Valley of Gods Mountain, his heart
and affections ſhall be there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yea, ye ſhall flee like as ye fled from the Earthquake in the dayes of</hi>
Uzziah <hi>King of</hi> Judah, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 16. There <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> after his
good ſucceſs in the War, apoſtatized from his former good life;
his good ſucceſs made him ſelf-conceited, and turn <hi>Independent,</hi>
that is, take upon him the Prieſts Office as well as the Kings: He
would be the onely Saints in the Kingdom, by uſurping the Prieſts
Office; the Prieſts being godly bold men, proteſt againſt him and
his proceedings, as againſt the written Law of God, againſt the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:117866:48"/>
Scriptures: but that's all one to him, the impulſe of his ſpirit was
ſuch, upon his good ſucceſs in his late Wars, that notwithſtanding
the Prieſts proteſt, he was reſolved to carry on his Deſign. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
there grows a civil war, as 'twere, betwixt the Covenant-keeping
Prieſts, and the Covenant-breaking King: the King here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
reſolved to murther the Prieſts that ſtood in his way and
croſſed his Deſign, <hi>Et mox ut Rex minatus eſt mortem Sacerdotibus</hi>
(ſaith <hi>Joſephus lib. 9. cap. 11. Antiquit.)</hi> as the King was breathing
out the threatnings of death againſt the Prieſts, God, from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,

that the new-created Saint was an unclean creature, fit to

This mans wickedneſs brought a terrible Earthquake upon the
Kingdom, ſuch a one as was, for its terrour, never before known
in <hi>Judea;</hi> it cleft the Temple in twain (ſaith <hi>Joſephus)</hi> and before
the City (in a place called <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ogie)</hi> the half of a Mountain that
ſtood to the Eaſtward, brake, and fell, and removed, for the ſpace
of four <hi>ſtadia,</hi> ſo that the high-ways were ſtopped up, and the
Kings gardens of pleaſure were wholly ruinated and disfigured:
this Earthquake could not chooſe but amaze and terrifie the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and make them flee out of their houſes.</p>
            <p>Such a time of tribulation and terrour it ſhall be when God
comes to deſtroy the Beaſt of the Earth, that takes upon him the
Office of a Miniſter of the Goſpel, to teach and preach, publickely,
Divinity: this Uſurper that goes on and perſiſts in his wickedneſs
and bloudy attempts againſt the true Church, and the godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery.</p>
            <p>Therefore 'tis ſaid at the deſtruction of this Beaſt, <hi>Rev. 11. 13.
That there was a great Earthquake, and the tenth part of the City
fell;</hi> and at <hi>(Rev. 16. 18.)</hi> the pouring out of the ſeventh Viall
there was a great Earthquake. This cleerly ſhews us at what
time we muſt expect theſe things, 'tis at the ſounding of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Trumpet where are Earth-quakes; and the next words
make it more cleer, <hi>And the Lord my God ſhall come, and all the
Saints with thee. Oecolampadius</hi> thinks, that when God hath ruined
Antichriſt, then the day of judgment ſhall be: but ſaith he, <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
dicunt interceſſurum tempus quoddam inter regnum Chriſti, &amp;
Antichristi mille Annos;</hi> ſo that this is no new Opinion: Of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:117866:49"/>
this opinion am I; for I believe before the Day of Judgment, and
after the ruine of Antichriſt, there ſhall be 1000. years, as I ſhall
make appear (ſaith <hi>Deodat)</hi> He ſhall come to deſtroy Antichriſt,
this is the time of the ſeventh Trumpet, when Chriſt ſhall come
on his white horſe, and all his Saints clothed with white linnen,
and riding on horſes ſhall come along with him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. and <hi>Rev.</hi>
14. 1. After the Beaſt of the Earth is meaſured, numbered, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and found too light, then follows Chriſt ſtanding on Mount
Sion, with all his Saints with him: ſo in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 9. after <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaw
the little horn (which is this Beaſt of the Earth) immediatly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
the Lord Jeſus, his Throne is ſet up, and thouſands, and ten
thouſands miniſtring to him, and in <hi>Dan. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>1.</hi> 45. When this Beaſt
of the Earth (for 'tis the ſame) pitcheth his Tents in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of delight of holineſs, that is, that part of the Mountain to
the North, which is <hi>Scotland,</hi> there God ſhall ruine him: and then
immediatly follows <hi>(Dan. 12. 1.)</hi> in the next verſe, <hi>Michael,</hi> that
is, Chriſt ſhall ſtand up, who ſtandeth for the people, and there
ſhall be a time of trouble, ſuch as never was ſince there was a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
at that time the Jews ſhall be called out of the grave of
ſinne and unbelief, to the lively knowledge of the Goſpel: Theſe
things are ſo cleerly ſpoken of one and the ſame time, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
that he that reads them ſeriouſly cannot but ſee they are all
Prophecies, foretelling the things that ſhall come to paſs in this
age of the world.</p>
            <p>V. 6. <hi>And in that day</hi> (that is, ſay many Interpreters, when
Chriſt ſhall come to deſtroy Antichriſt) <hi>there ſhall be no clear light,
but dark.</hi> Others read it better <hi>(the light ſhall not be clear nor
dark)</hi> to a word it is <hi>[the light ſhall not be precious nor thickneſs]</hi>
it ſhall neither be a time of precious light and Goſpel-knowledg,
nor a time of thick darkneſs: It ſhall be a time of the ſtrangeſt
uncouths condition to the Church as ever was: Magiſtracy ſhall
be laid aſide, Miniſters ſhall be perſecuted, out-lawed, baniſhed,
and all this by the Saints, the men that pull down Antichriſt (as
they ſay) there's the myſtery, there's the ſadneſs; men that
hold the ſame principles of Religion, that were baptized with
the ſame baptiſm, that have faſted with the Saints who are reall
Saints, that have communicated with them at the ſame Table,
they ſhall perſecute the Miniſtery; theſe ſhall rejoyce at the fall
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:117866:49"/>
and ruine of the Church; theſe men ſhall cry, at the affliction of
the Juſt, <hi>Ah, ha, ſo we would have it.</hi> Is not this a diſmal day when
one Parliament man ſhall impriſon another, and one Miniſter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie,
and reproach another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It ſhall be neither day nor light, light nor dark;</hi> men ſhall not
know what to make of the times: one ſhall ſay 'tis Evening, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhall ſay 'tis Morning: another ſhall ſay 'tis Noon-day: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhall ſay 'tis neither. One ſaith (as my fine Doctor that I
deal with) that 'tis the morning of a glorious Reformation: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
how far it is carryed on, even to the murthering of a King,
and blowing up of a Parliament. Another (and that juſtly from
Scripture-grounds) ſaith, this mock-reformation is the ſlaying of
the Witneſſes. Another ſaith, in the grief of his heart, the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Goſpel is coming upon <hi>England,</hi> and God is carrying
it into ſome other Nation: as God, when the Jews rejected a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
loſt the Sun-ſhine of the Goſpel, and it ſhin'd glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
upon the Gentiles: ſo when Chriſt comes to call the Jews,
the Gentiles that deſpiſe that way of Chriſts coming in a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation-way
to call the Jews, may juſtly have the Goſpel taken
from them; and the <hi>Miniſters</hi> may give that dolefull farewell to
<hi>England,</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> gave to the Jews, <hi>Behold, we turn from you, and
go to the Gentiles:</hi> This is juſtly to be (I know not whether I had
beſt ſay hoped, or) feared; yet for my Countries and Kinsfolks
ſakes, I'le ſay feared: but <hi>England</hi> is moſt unworthy, it hath reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
a Reformation, and I much fear the ſet-day: and God, by
perſecution (as fourteen years ſince, by the Prelates perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he did) is now calling his Miniſters away to ſome
greater Harveſt; for here they fiſh day and night, and
catch nothing: they plow and ſow abundantly, but they
reap no fruit: In <hi>New-England</hi> the harveſt begins to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
upon thoſe few Labourers hands, there the poor ſoules can
weep out a whole Sermon; and in the midſt of their buſineſs, in
their hard labour their ſoules in the field can groan within them
for wounding Chriſt: and here in <hi>Old-England</hi> men deſpiſe the
Miniſters, and the meſſage they bring, perſecute them, ſlander
them, and uſe all violent means to drive them out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
Really, I much fear, 'tis Evening with <hi>England:</hi> but what
do I mean? I forget my ſelf, I am expounding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It ſhall neither be light nor dark,</hi> that is, it ſhall be neither
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:117866:50"/>
night of deſpaire, nor day of aſſurance, it ſhall be neither night of
diſpondency, nor day of comfort. What ſhall I ſay? I will ſay
no more; for I am confident every man that lives, in theſe times,
that is in his ſenſes, and obſerves the times, hath a ready Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon this text. <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> refers this to <hi>Luke</hi> 21. where
<hi>the Sun ſhall be darkened, and the Moon ſhall not give her light;</hi> it
may be <hi>v.</hi> 7. repreſents the ſtate of the ſlain Witneſſes: but it
ſhall be one day, it is known to the Lord: By day is here meant
a year, a Prophetick day; though this Beaſt of the Earth reigne
three years and a half, yet he ſhall thus tyrannize but one yeare,
that's the comfort; he ſhall make a rent betwixt the North and
the South but one year; 'tis but one year that it ſhall be neither
light nor dark; and here is the comfort of all, in the evening of
that day, that is, in the later end of the year it ſhall be light, he
ſhall tyrannize in <hi>Scotland</hi> but one yeer. Now the great queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is, what yeer this yeer is, when 'twill be: the Doctor ſaith,
this yeer. Though I cannot fiddle with the Doctor, yet I'll keep
time with him as neer as I can. Doth he ſay great things ſhall be
done againſt Antichriſt about the yeer 1650? So do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: But here
the Doctor and I ſhall run in diſcords: thoſe whom the Doctor
calls (I am confident againſt his conſcience) Antichriſtian, I up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſure and infallible grounds call them viſible Saints: that is,
the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that now defend the Covenant-cauſe,
and a diſtreſſed lawfull Magiſtracy, and a lawfull rightly conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
Miniſtery and Eccleſiaſtick Diſcipline. And thoſe whom
the Doctor calls holy ones, the holy Heretikes, and the holy
Gun-powder Traytors, and the holy Covenant-breakers, and
the holy Apoſtates, (for they are viſibly ſuch to all the world)
thoſe I call by their right names, as they appear to the world by
their actions, <hi>viz.</hi> the laſt bloudy enemies of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Goſpel Church,
who <hi>in the later part of the laſt times</hi> (as M. <hi>Tho. Goodwin</hi> ſaith)
<hi>ſhall ariſe and ſlay the Witneſſes;</hi> that is, a godly Magiſtracy and
Miniſtery, who had finiſhed their teſtimony, and fitted all things
for a complete reformation: theſe enemies of the Church, I call
them enemies, and theſe goodly painted hypocrits, I call them ſo;
I do not number them by their names, but I count them by their
actions, by what they do, not by what they ſay: and thence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
infallibly, they are Antichriſtian, for by their fruits, not
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:117866:50"/>
leaves, I know them to be ſuch; and (contrary to the Doctor) I do
verily believe, that ſoon after this-yeer 1650. God will raiſe up
the Witneſſes in <hi>Scotland,</hi> overthrow, conſume, and utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the Doctors holy Army, holy State, and holy Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth:
And my reaſons are taken partly out of the Doctors
own mouth: for about this time the Pope of <hi>Romes</hi> tyrannizing
over the Church is expired; and to go one ſtep further then the
Doctor, within ſix moneths, I conceive, after the end
of this yeer, 1650. the reigne of the Beaſt of the
Earth which ſlayes the Witneſſes is out, and the time of
the Witneſſes lying dead is out, and they muſt riſe, whoſe riſing is
the Beaſts ruine; the riſing of a lawfull Magiſtracy and Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
will be the ruine of Democrary and Independency: For the
battell muſt be fought by lawfull Magiſtracy and lawfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
againſt Uſurpers in Church and State.</p>
            <p>The Doctor hath proved that the Popes time of tyrannizing
is out in 1650. My buſineſſe then ſhall be to prove, that he that
ſlays the Witneſſes, his time is out ſoon after the end of this yeer
1650 I have proved it already, I will therefore only explain that
part of <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. from <hi>v.</hi> 36. to the end, not preciſely every verſe,
but ſo much as may illuſtrate the tenent, that in all probability
immediately after the end of this yeer 1650. will be the downfall
of <hi>Cromwell</hi> and his Army, and his new government, which he
hath by his ſword erected. Obſerve therefore this, that <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.
from verſe the 11. to the end, and <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 36. to the end are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
both of one Beaſt, and do both in the ſame manner ſet forth
his government, and tyranny, and bloudy cruelty, and ſucceſſe in
his actions: therfore you read in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 14. of an image which
he makes men to worſhip, and in <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 36. you read of the
god <hi>Mauzzim</hi> that he ſets up: both theſe are one and the ſame
thing, and ſignifie a ſword-power, that this Beaſt ſhall ſet up: I
have many learned Expoſitors on my ſide in the interpretation of
both texts, and ſome of the Fathers, with whom I fall full jump
in the explication; for they ſay that the Beaſt, in both places, is
that Antichriſt that ſhall ariſe when the Roman Monarchy ſhall
be deſtroyed, and ſlay the Witneſſes, and reigne three years and
an half: Now we muſt reckon the beginning of this Beaſts reign
the time that he ſet up his god <hi>Mauzzim,</hi> and exalted himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all other government; and this was when he got the ſhips
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:117866:51"/>
at ſea, the Forts, Caſtles Forces, Magazines, &amp; whole power of the
ſword into his own hands at land: This was done in the year, 1647.
and about <hi>September</hi> or <hi>October.</hi> In the ſame year, ſo that near
about that time, we muſt begin the Beaſts raign; and then about
the evening of the day, that is, the latter end of that year, when
he divides the two Kingdoms, the Beaſts three years &amp; an half wil
be out: but mark what ſhal come to paſs immediately before this
year of diviſion, <hi>Dan. 12. 40. At the time of the end ſhall the King of
the South puſh at him, and the King of the North ſhall come up againſt
him like a whirlwind, with Chariots, &amp; with Horſemen, &amp; with many
ſhips:</hi> In <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. 14. there you have the Mountain divided into
North and South: Here you have in this verſe the North and
the South joyned together, to overthrow the Beaſt of the Earth,
which hath ſet up his God <hi>Mauzzim</hi> his Sword-power: This
was cleerly fulfilled in the Northern Invaſion, and the Southern
Inſurrection; I will not inlarge here in ſo plain a thing: but what
ſhall be their ſucceſs? they ſhall be overthrown by him, and he
ſhall enter into the Countries, and ſhall overflow and paſs over:
<hi>[He]</hi> that is, he that ſets up the God <hi>Mauzzim,</hi> he ſhall overtop
both the Northern Invaders, and the Southern Inſurrections: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the King of the North, nor the King of the South ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
him, he ſhall paſs over them, <hi>v. 41. He ſhall enter into the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am of Mr. <hi>Jeremiah Burroughs</hi> opinion, that <hi>Scotland</hi> is the
gloriouſeſt Land in the world for holineſs: therefore I think it is
meant <hi>Scotland,</hi> that he ſhould enter; as he did, after he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
<hi>Hambleton's</hi> forces, he entred the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and many ſhall be overthrown: Some read <hi>[and many Countries
ſhall be overthrown]</hi> but there is no ſuch word as <hi>(Countries)</hi> in
the Hebrew: Therefore I humbly conceive 'tis better read, <hi>and
many ſhall be overthrown,</hi> that is, many noble families, many great
perſons, and many people ſhall; but theſe ſhall eſcape out of his
hand, <hi>Edom,</hi> and <hi>Moab,</hi> and the chief of the children of <hi>Amon:</hi> the
ancieut, and the latter Expoſitors, have miſtook this text, in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
it onely a literal ſenſe, which the Holy Ghoſt intends not;
for by <hi>Edom,</hi> and <hi>Moab,</hi> and <hi>Ammon,</hi> are meant the Enemies of the
Church, who plead the ſame priviledges that the Church pleads;
as <hi>Eſau</hi> was the eldeſt ſon of <hi>Iſaac</hi> by birth, but he ſold his birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:117866:51"/>
and became an apoſtate, and ſo did his poſterity, who were
from him called <hi>Edomites:</hi> But theſe Apoſtates pretended (as the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth) that they were the true Church, becauſe
they came from the eldeſt ſon of <hi>Iſaac:</hi> and ſo <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
though moſt abominable Idolaters, yet ſaid, that their father
was <hi>Lot,</hi> and they were the true Church, though they were begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in inceſt; as all Hereſies and Hereticks are gotten by corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Holy Word, and Truth of God; ſo that by <hi>Edom,</hi> and
<hi>Moab,</hi> and <hi>Ammon,</hi> that eſcape this Beaſts clutches, may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
Hereticks and Apoſtates: if ſo, how cleerly doth this point
out of the Beaſt to us? or if by <hi>Ammon</hi> and <hi>Moab,</hi> may be meant
thoſe murtherers of the King, Traytors: for in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 46. a
<hi>Moabite,</hi> and an <hi>Ammonite,</hi> one of the chief of the children of
<hi>Ammon,</hi> conſpired againſt the King and ſlew him, ſo that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
Covenant-breakers, Hereticks, and Traytors, conſpirers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the King, ſhall eſcape him: whereſoever he comes, you
may know this beaſt by his followers, for none but ſuch are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
by him, and beloved of him. By <hi>Moab</hi> may be meant
the malicious party who pretend religiouſly to curſe the Church
of God by their hypocritical hirelings, ſuch as <hi>Balam,</hi> who for a
good place, or office, will vilifie that cauſe which they once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed

on the North of it: Now tydings from the North and Eaſt

that's to the Eaſt of him, and the <hi>Scots</hi> in the North call a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſend Commiſſioners from <hi>Scotland</hi> to treat with the

him out of <hi>Ireland</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> from whence he ſhall go with

            <p>This year is that year which is neither dark nor light to the
Church, it is a gloomy day, no ſun nor ſtars appear, to direct or
comfort the Church. They know not whether the ſun be riſing
or ſetting upon them, paleneſs is in all faces, 'tis a cloudy, ſad, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy

things againſt the Church, yet the end of the year ſhall
ſpeak comfort and ſalvation to the Church. Or elſe it ſhall be in
the Evening, that is, when all is ſtill and quiet, when the Enemies
think all is their own, and when the Church thinks the Evening
of dark and ſad deſolation is coming on her. In the Evening
when the Enemies of the Church are lying down, have drawn the
Curtains of ſecurity over them, when like the glutton they begin
to ſay, <hi>ſoul take thy rest, eat, drink, and be merry, thou haſt enough laid

theſe places of Scripture prophecying of the ſounding of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Trumpet, and the things that ſhall immediatly precede the
powring out of the Vials ſeem to tell us, that God will mightily
appear in the raiſing up of a diſtreſſed, perſecuted, deſpiſed Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:117866:53"/>
and Miniſtery in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and give them unexpected ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
againſt their Enemies, to the overthrowing of Popery and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency,
and the eſtabliſhing of the three Kingdoms ſpeedily
in a Covenant-Reformation: Confident I am that <hi>Scotland</hi> is
the place where the Enemies of the Church ſhall be gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to deſtroy them; and moſt confident I am, that there the
Enemies that go againſt them ſhall be broken, there will Chriſt
appear for his Churches deliverance, and his Enemies confuſion:
and this is one great argument with me <hi>(viz.)</hi> the great diſtreſſe
and ſad affliction that the Church at this preſent time is in: In
<hi>England</hi> the very foundations are caſt down, and the righteous
know not what to do; their eyes are onely up to God, the poor
Church is drove up into a diſperſed corner of the world, it hath
lately had a ſore and deadly wound in the defeating of a ſtately
Army; they have loſt their chief City, they are baniſhed from
their habitations; they have loſt one of their chief Sea-Port
Towns, and the chief Caſtle and ſtrongeſt Hold in that Kingdom;
they have a potent, a bloudy, a ſubtil, and a reſolved Army to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
withall; they every day grow ſtronger and ſtronger, and
by their power and policy, infeeble and weaken the poor
Church in <hi>Scotland:</hi> by their policy they have bred diviſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Scots;</hi> they are but a little number that are called, and
faithful, and choſen, and that little flock are like to be ſurrounded
with Enemies; for if the Pope and his party can poſſibly incite
any of the great family againſt the Kirk, they will: and in great
meaſure the <hi>Scots,</hi> this day, have experience of it: now when they
have enemies and dangers round about them, and are but feeble
and weak, and in the eye of the world, and of their Enemes utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
loſt.</p>
            <p>Then is the time, yea then, the ſet time is come for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance:
and this I prove from <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 2, 3. When the Church
was delivered, which is ſpoken of this time of deliverance from
the Beaſt of the Earth: for they <hi>(ver. 2.)</hi> got the victory over the
Beaſt, and his Image, and his Mark, and the number of his name;
Now this is none other then the Beaſt that goes to pull down
Kingly Government, and ſet up his Image or Government, and
make that Nation receive his mark <hi>(i.e.)</hi> ſubſcribe to his Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:117866:53"/>
Now when this victory is gotten over the Beaſt <hi>(v. 3.)</hi> they
ſang the ſong of <hi>Moſes Exod.</hi> 15. which was a tryumphant ſong,
after their deliverance from a potent, malicious, reſolved Enemy,
that had the Church of God at the greateſt diſadvantage that
might be, for he had them all in a valley; on one hand the Forts
and ſtrong Holds of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> on the other hand, an unpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable
Mountain; before them the deep ſea; and behind them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
furious Enemy, compleatly armed, and fully reſolved utterly to
ruine them: Now in this diſtreſs the Lord looks upon them,
and viſits them with a cloud, there was the viſible power of God
ſeen; and after that cloud came, the Sea was divided, the Church
was preſerved, and the Enemy drowned; and then <hi>Moſes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
his ſong, which is altogether to magnifie the glorious and
magnificent power of God, in the deliverance of his Church in ſo
great a ſtraight, and deſtroy the proud and potent Enemy with ſo
terrible and ſwift deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Now this ſong the Church muſt ſing when God gives her vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
over her Enemies: therefore her deliverance ſhall be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and her Enemies deſtruction terrible, that is, that new ſong
the Saints of God ſhall ſing, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. which alludes to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick
Pſalm, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 98. where you have every thing runs parallel
with <hi>John's</hi> Viſion, for there you have a new ſong, and the cauſe
of it, 'tis for a marvellous great victory gotten by Gods own
Arm, in an eminent manner, in the ſight of the Heathen, <hi>ver.</hi> 2.
and then at that time the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the ends of the
Earth ſee the ſalvation of God, as the Angel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 6. preacheth
it; and then <hi>ver.</hi> 4. there is a Hallelujah, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. with the Harp,
which the Harpers have, <hi>ver. 7. the ſea roars, and the earth, and the
flouds claſh one againſt another:</hi> but <hi>ver. 19. the Mountains (of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs)
rejoyce, becauſe he is come to judge the earth.</hi> Read the next
Pſalm, it gives great light into theſe texts, to be fulfilled in theſe
times: Be not therefore diſcouraged (O ye Saints of God) be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
be conſtant, be couragious; be not faithleſs, but believe,
when your affliction and diſtreſs is greateſt, then is your deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
neareſt, when your Enemies are moſt cruel, moſt confident,
moſt ſtrong, moſt malicious, and moſt ſecure; then will Chriſt
come in the cloud, then will he appear on the white cloud with
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:117866:54"/>
the ſickle in his hand to cut down your Enemies: bleſſed are you
in this day that watch and keep on your ſpiritual garments, for
Chriſt will aſſuredly come, and he will come as a thief, at una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares,
unexpected: behold the time is at hand, your temptations
are great, the Devil is ſifting you, and winowing you as wheat; it
is a day of tribulation, &amp; of great ſorrow; it is a day wherein your
Enemies rejoyce, and make merry; it is a day of great rebuke and
ſhame to the Church, the enemies ſay, <hi>ah, ha, ſo we would have it,
Edom's</hi> ſons cry, <hi>down with the walls of Zion, down with them to the
ground.</hi> It was never a ſadder day with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and
<hi>Scotland,</hi> ſince the Goſpel was preached amongſt them, then
now. I dare appeal to all the Hiſtorians in the world, whether
ever the Goſpel was ſo deſperately perſecuted, and ſo neer to
ruine, as now it is. Look in <hi>England,</hi> and the very foundations
of the Goſpel are rooting up, I mean the Doctrinal-foundation:
Do I ſay onely Doctrinal, nay, but I do affirm the perſonal foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the Goſpel is rooting up: Are not the Scriptures
which are the ſpiritual foundation of the Goſpel, denyed to be
the Word of God? and do not men ſet their accurſed luſts above
the Holy Scriptures, in maintaining, that no more is Scripture
then what their ſpirits cloſe with? and is not the Lord Jeſus deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be God, and the Son of God, and the ſecond perſon in the
Trinity: and do they not affirm, that he is not the Purchaſer of
ſalvation for the Elect? And to go a little further, are not the
Miniſterial foundations <hi>(viz.)</hi> Magiſtracy and Miniſtery thrown
down: was there ever more open villanies committed againſt the
perſons and offices of Magiſtrates and Miniſters then at this day?
How is the Magiſtracy trampled in the dirt, and their ſpoyls divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?
How are Miniſters impriſoned, baniſhed, ſequeſtered, and
ſilenced? How grievous and intolerable are the burthens that
they lay on the poor Miniſters bodies and ſouls? They have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away their eſtates, and ſo expoſe their poor families to ruine:
they impoſe a moſt unjuſt and unconſcionable Oath upon them,
directly contrary to thoſe lawful Oaths they took before; and for
the not ſubſcribing of it (which no conſciencious Proteſtant will
do, or can do) they are out-lawed, ſhut out of protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
out of their livelyhoods, and expoſed to utter ruine, at the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:117866:54"/>
pleaſure of any of the ſons of violence: and what condition have
they put the Papiſts, thoſe bloudy and inveterate Enemies of
the Proteſtants? What becomes of the Laws in force againſt
them? Are they not all repealed? What's become of thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminating
Oaths that moleſt the Papiſts peace in this Kingdom?
Are they not all taken away? and is not onely the ſincere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencious
Proteſtant, the man whoſe eſtate, office, perſon, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
lyeth at the mercy of bloudy Papiſts, and Gunpowder tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors?
Who is ſo blind as not plainly to ſee theſe things? and
what conſciencious Proteſtant ſo ſecure, as not to feel it? And
as for <hi>Scotland,</hi> though, bleſſed be the Lord, there be a godly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy
and Miniſtery as yet ſtanding, yet how neer are they to
their fall? How great a blow have they received already? How
many enemies have they againſt them? The Pope and all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians
in England, Holland, Ireland, Spain, France are active a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them; in England the whole wealth and ſtrength of it is
imployed to ruine the Kingdome of Scotland; in Holland and
France, the ſame Popiſh Politicians, are imployed to raiſe rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
againſt Kingly Government; in Ireland the arch Rebells
are in a League with the Common-wealth of England, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
renounced Kingly Government long before, were the firſt
that owned the Common-wealth of England, and gave them a
Title; whereupon Collonel <hi>Monk</hi> made a peace with them:
This Collonel <hi>Monk</hi> is now as Major Generall of the Foot under
<hi>Cromwel</hi> in Scotland, Spain hath owned this preſent power that
cut off the King, for a Free-State and Common-wealth, and
drives the ſame deſign to throw down the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi>
and <hi>France</hi> with <hi>England,</hi> yea, the Popes Agents in <hi>Scotland</hi> are
active in ſtirring up thoſe Papiſtical Families in <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt
the Kirks party, who are the Covenanting party: It would be
too long to tell how the Spaniſh Faction (to ſay no more) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth
this day throughout <hi>Europe:</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
the Popes temporal power, is like, by the Jeſuited-State-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
to be overthrown: the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> is in a probable
way to be overthrown by the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> the <hi>Hollander</hi> which
was the ſupply of <hi>Scotland</hi> for Ammunition, ſince the Prince of
<hi>Orange's</hi> death, is like, by their own civil jars, to become a prey to

the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> after deſignes betwixt England and Spain are

who cannot ſee all things cutting out againſt the Proteſtants, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Model, who cannot ſee that perfected,
which was intended long ſince, who ſees not thoſe diſmall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
againſt Magiſtracy and Miniſtery, now compleated and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed,
which were intended, 1588. by the King of <hi>Spain's</hi>
Armado, againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and by the Gunpowder Traytors
againſt King <hi>James.</hi> Something 'tis that makes the Spaniſh Court
triumph; 'tis becauſe they have drave the Royal Family of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Scotland</hi> into great diſtreſs; it is helpleſs throughout
the world; no Kingdom nor Nation lends that diſtreſſed Family
their helping hand: the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the great comforter of
that Family, is taken out of the World: and the Queen of Swead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
ſnatched from him by the Emperor. The Engliſh Nation are
divided into Independents, Prelaticall men, and Presbyterians
for the moſt part; the Independent and Prelaticall Party are
ingaged by Oath againſt the Magiſtracy and Miniſtery of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
for they all for the moſt part take the Engagement, they
have only a few Presbyterians, who are impoveriſhed in their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
caſt out of Office, and out-lawed that adheare to them, and
they only in affection, all they can do is to faſt and pray, and
powre out their ſouls, both in publique and private, for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed
Magiſtracy and Miniſtery of Scotland, this is all the help
they can afford them: France cannot help themſelves, much leſſe
are they able to help Scotland in their diſtreſſes. Now this day
there is a vaſt and terrible Army gone up againſt them; and if
that Army ſhould overcome, and ruine utterly the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy
and Miniſtery in Scotland; the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
would not have any place in Europe to reſt the ſole of his
foot on. I am informed alſo that in <hi>New-England,</hi> the ſame
ſubtill Jeſuited Saints that have blown us up in <hi>Old-England,</hi>
have put them alſo into miſerable confuſion and civill broils.
Judge now Chriſtian Reader, how neer the Church is to it's
dreadfull overthrow. Now here is the comfort, theſe troubles
and great calamities of the Church, are the ſure fore-runners of
the Church her great deliverance, the world cannot believe this,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:117866:55"/>
and the reaſon is, becauſe they have no true faith, nor patience,
though they talk much of it; an Hypocrites faith is not able to
defend him in ſuch fiery afflictions, nor his patience able to go
through ſuch miery ways of perſecution, hypocrites many brag of
their helmet and breaſt plate, but onely reall Saints can ſhew the
ſhooes of patience and perſeverance, &amp; the ſhield of faith in ſuch
times as theſe when hypocrites gracesare be jaded, the Saints go
on merrily, though hypocrites ſay 'tis impoſſible the times ſhould
turn, or that ever the Covenant-Reformation ſhould be carryed
ſon; &amp; therefore unworthy-timerous-profeſſors now commonly
ay, <hi>Truly we are in the dark, we know not what to think:</hi> ſuch a hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite
ſees if he hold to his principles he ſhall be in the dark of
affliction; and therefore he makes a ſtop, and turns back: Another,
more ſubtil in his hypocriſie, cries out for Brotherly-love, and
peaceable complyance: and he to follow after temporal peace,
caſts off the paths of righteouſneſs againſt his oaths and vows; the
truth is, he is an hypocrite that hath not patience to walk in the
thorny-ſtony-way of perſecution; but a reall Saint hath theſe
two graces eminently ſhining in him; he wil not diſpond nor mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
againſt God, or the Cauſe of God, though the Cauſe of
God, and the Defenders of it be under great reproach, and cruell
p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rſecution; he'll believe in a perſecuted, reproached, wounded,
forſaken, and crucified Chriſt, as well as in a glorified, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
Chriſt: and then he follows Chriſt patiently, through hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and cold, and diſgrace, as well as in the midſt of proſperity
and eaſe: he'll be in the ſhip with Chriſt as well when that ſhip is
in a ſtorm, as when 'tis in a calm, and all becauſe he hath a ſtrong
faith in Chriſt: he knows that he can never ſink ſo long as Chriſt
is with him: he knows 'tis for the glory of that God whom he
ſerves, to bring his people into the Valley of <hi>Achor,</hi> before he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
a door of hope; 'tis true, the times are now ſad, and it is the
blackeſt day now with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> that
ever was known or ſeen: but is this an argument with a reall
Saint therefore to leave the Church? God forbid, a reall Saint
will truſt in God; yea, and die for the truth, <hi>though he kill me, yet
will I truſt in him:</hi> and therefore, by way of admiration, the Holy
Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>Here is the patience, and here is the faith of the Saints,
and here are they that keep the Commandements.</hi> There are without
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:117866:56"/>
Apoſtates, Perſecuters, Covenant-breakers, Traytors, unnaturall
men; but here are they that keep the Commandements, here's
Covenant-keepers, ſincere worſhippers of God; holding faſt to
their principles: Their graces ſhall in this age diſtinguiſh them
from other men in the world by their conſtancy in the truth, and
their cheerful and patient bearing Chriſts yoak.</p>
            <p>Now here is the comfort, as this day none ſhall be like it for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
ſo none ſhall be like it for deliverance: This day, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.

            <p>It ſhall be a day of grievous ſorrow for the preſent, ſuch is a

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> trouble: now <hi>Jacob's</hi> trouble you ſhall
read in <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. The good-man was going from a cruel-maſter
with his wives, and all his ſubſtance, into <hi>Canaan;</hi> after he had
gone ſome days journey, his father-in-law purſues him fiercely
with armed men; but God delivering <hi>Jacob</hi> from that Enemy,
the very next news that he hears is that <hi>Eſau,</hi> his brother <hi>Eſau</hi>
was coming with an Army againſt him: What a ſtraight was poor
<hi>Jacob</hi> in, had he gone back, he had been made a ſlave of by his cruel
Father-in-law: if he went forward, his own brother that came
out of the ſame womb, and ſucked of the ſame breaſt, would kill
him, and take his wives and all his ſubſtance: what a fright was
he in at this time? Even ſo ſhall the Church of God at this time,
immediatly before the ſeed of <hi>Jacob</hi> return again to their own
country: the Church of God which hath been delivered from an
open cruel Enemy that perſecuted her, ſhall on a ſudden, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly,
fall into the bloudy hands of one that like <hi>Eſau</hi>
comes out of the bowels of the Church; but it is an Apoſtate
that for the pottage of preferment, and worldly pomp, hath ſold
himſelf to work all manner of miſchief againſt the Church: but
here is the comfort in the ſame verſe, yet the Church ſhall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from it: in the Evening of this day it ſhall be light to the
Church of God, and then follows the 12 Tribes converſion.</p>
            <p>Q. But where ſhall this great deliverance of the Church be?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In <hi>Eſay 59. 18, 19. He will deſtroy with his fury</hi> (the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:117866:56"/>
will) <hi>his enemies in the Iſlands, ſo ſhall they fear his name from
the Weſt, and his glory from the riſing of the Sun, His lightning ſhall
ſhine in the West when he comes to deſtroy his enemies, Mat.</hi> 24. 27.
and this he will do by a mighty deliverance of the Church, for
when the Enemies ſhall come like a floud (againſt which there's
no ſtanding) then the Spirit of the Lord ſhall lift up a ſtandard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, or (neerer the Copy) put him to flight, and then the
Lord Jeſus will call the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the twelve Tribes, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the Goſpel: when mans power is not able to withſtand the
force of the Enemy, then God ariſeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But after what manner, or by what means will God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the twelve Tribes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt tells us, <hi>Eſay</hi> 49. 21, 22, 23. the whole chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is a deſcription of the glorious Goſpel-day when Chriſt ſhall
deliver both Jews and Gentiles from the Devils bondage, and
Antichriſts yoak, in <hi>v.</hi> 6. there's Chriſts Commiſſion to raiſe up the
Tribes of <hi>Jacob,</hi> God hath appointed him for that end, that he
may call the ſcattered Tribes from the North, and from the weſt,
&amp; from the land of <hi>Sinim:</hi> but the Jew ſhall ſay in his heart, <hi>Who
hath begotten me theſe ſeeing I am barren, and deſolate, a captive and
a wanderer to and fro, and who hath nouriſhed them? Behold I was
left alone, whence are theſe?</hi> This is the queſtion that the Jews
ask at the time of their beginning to be converted, and brought
from the North, and from the Weſt, and from the Land of <hi>Sinim.</hi>
But obſerve the Anſwer the Holy Ghoſt gives, <hi>v. 22. Thus ſaith
the Lord God, Behold I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles, and ſet up
my standart to the people, and they ſhall bring thy ſons in their armes,
and thy daughters ſhall be carryed on their ſhoulders:</hi> The meaning
is, God will command the converted Gentiles, the Miniſters of
the Gentile Church, and they ſhall hold out the white flag of the
Goſpel of reconciliation by Jeſus Chriſt (for that's Chriſts Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dart)
and this ſhall be the way of their converſion: but that's not
all, for in the next verſe <hi>(v. 23.) and Kings ſhall be thy nurſing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and Queens ſhall be thy Nurſes:</hi> converted Gentile-Kings
ſhall invite the Jews into their Kingdome, and give them leave
fairly to bring in their ſcruples they have againſt Chriſt, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
men to ſatisfie their doubts, give them leave (which the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:117866:57"/>
Pope will not do) to read the New Teſtament, and compare
Chriſtians principles with the, ir principles: For ſo the Prophet
ſaith, <hi>They ſhall be converted they ſhall ſee eye to eye,</hi> that is, by the
Eye of the Old Teſtament, they ſhall ſee into the New; and by
the Eye of the New, they ſhall ſee into the Old Teſtament-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
fulfilled; ſo that the godly Magiſtracy thoſe are Kings,
and the goldy Miniſtery, amongſt the Gentiles, ſhall be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of converting the Jews.</p>
            <p>Hereupon my hopes and grounds are, that God will by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
ſo mould and frame the heart of the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
then raiſe him to ſo great a power, as that he will not only be the
great inſtrument of throwing down Antichriſt, but alſo a great
inſtrument in converting of the Jews, in the Weſt-Indies, and
Eaſt-Indies, where the people thirſt abundantly after the Word,
but there are few to deal the bread of life to them. I have great
hopes that God will yet again, by an Engliſh Monarch, do migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
things againſt Rome-Antichriſtian, and for the propagating
of the Goſpel: and my reaſons are, Becauſe God choſe the firſt
Monarch in the world to be a Chriſtian, and a Defender of the
Faith in this Kingdom. <hi>Lucius</hi> was King of <hi>England,</hi> and he that
God choſe to make the Vicar (as <hi>Elutherius</hi> Biſhop of Rome ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him) this was <hi>Anno Chriſti,</hi> 180.</p>
            <p>Abou 120 years after, God raiſed up out of this Kingdom a
Chriſtian Emperour, <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who was the Son of <hi>Hellena</hi> that
beautiful <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Princeſs.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Constantine</hi> God made the great Inſtrument of throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down the Heathen Emperours, &amp; turning the whole Empire
from Paganiſm to Chriſtianity, He freed the Chriſtians from their
priſons, and ſaved them from being any more tortured for <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
Since that time Religion was never quite extinguiſhed; but the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ttiſh</hi>
people, notwithſtanding their afflictions, kept their Religion
amongſt them, after Rome apoſtatized from its primitive purity,
ſo far as from Rome-Chriſtian to become Rome-Antichriſtian.
We ſhall find in Hiſtory, that the Engliſh Monarchs were the firſt
that oppoſed the Popes Tyranny. <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour was
one that ſhewed himſelf an Enemy to the Popes pomp, and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
and uſurpation. It may truly be ſaid that the Normans
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:117866:57"/>
deſpiſed and abhorred the Popes wicked uſurpation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Plantaginets</hi> curbed the Pope's inſolency: The
<hi>Tudars</hi> likewiſe unhorſed the Popes. Obſerve here how the
<hi>Tudars</hi> came in, <hi>Henry</hi> 7. married <hi>Eliſabeth</hi> the eldeſt daughter
of <hi>Edward</hi> 4. and hereby unites the two Houſes of York and
Lancaſter: In the perſon of this King (ſaith Sir <hi>Robert Naunton</hi>
in his book called <hi>Fragmenta Regalia)</hi> the royall ſcepter fell
back into the current of the old Britiſh bloud, which by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion
of the Saxons, and afterwards by the conqueſt of the
Normans, had diſcontinued almoſt a thouſand years; ſo that all
the German, Norman, Burgundian, Caſtalian, and French at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements,
with the intermarriages, which eight hundred yeares
had acquired and incorporated, were all brought back into the
old royall line of the ancient Britiſh Chriſtian Kings. This being
ſo (which I verily believe) as 'tis one of the remarkableſt paſſages
in the world, ſo 'tis that which makes exceedingly for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the Kings of England are the lawfull Magiſtracy
of England, and that they are no uſurpers, and therfore one of
the Witneſſes. This <hi>Henry</hi> 7. married his eldeſt daughter <hi>Margaret</hi>
to the King of Scots. The <hi>Tudars</hi> expiring in Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the
off-ſpring of <hi>Margaret,</hi> who was matched into the royall Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the <hi>Stuarts,</hi> ſucceeded Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in the Engliſh throne by
a title cleer and unqueſtionable. Now as the <hi>Tudars</hi> unhorſed and
baniſhed the Pope, ſo the <hi>Stuarts</hi> ſtabbed the Pope; ſo that as Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
had the firſt King that ſubjected this Kingdom to Chriſt, and
the firſt Emperor that ſubjected the Roman Empire to Chriſt, and
the firſt Kings that oppoſed Antichriſt: And as King <hi>Iames</hi> was
the firſt that proved the Pope to be Antichriſt, ſo his ſon was the
firſt King that ever was openly put to death for finiſhing his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
againſt Antichriſt. Hence it appeares, that as Monarchy
before Chriſt was viſible in the Church from <hi>Adam</hi> untill Chriſt,
ſo it hath been viſible in this Kingdom ſince Chriſt, from <hi>Lucius,</hi>
in a Chriſtian line of unqueſtionable ſucceſſion, unto this diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
King of Scotland, now perſecuted by Antichriſt. This King
was begot by a Proteſtant King, baptized by a Proteſtant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,
a Biſhop; he was born the heire of three Proteſtant King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:117866:58"/>
and is the ſucceſſor of a Martyr, who laid down his life for
the maintenance of the Proteſtant Religion; and this King hath
covenanted to maintain the Proteſtant Religion; all which could
never be ſaid of any King before; and therfore my hope and truſt
is, that King <hi>Iames</hi> his Grandchild ſhall be the King that ſhall
throw down Rome Antichriſtian, and be the great Inſtrument of
making both Jews and Gentiles bow down to a reall reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
eſpecially when in all probability theſe three Kingdoms are
the Kingdoms where the Witneſſes ſhall be ſlain by the uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a mean fellow, who ſhall ariſe and ſet up a new govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and take upon him to be Lord of the three Kingdoms;
this all the Fathers have told us, from <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 24, 25. and we ſee it
fulfilled in our eys. Now they ſay this vile fellow ſhall reign but
three years and an half, and then he ſhall fall with an utter ruine.
I have proved that in all probability 'tis this year that he ſhall
fall, and have ſhewed from Scripture what probability there is of
his fall in Scotland, it being the mountain of delights, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Kingdom in the world maintains ſuch a lawfull Magiſtracy,
and rightly conſtituted Miniſtery, and ſo reall, right and glorious
a reformation as Scotland doth. It hath been ſhewed alſo, what
probability there is, from the time alotted to Antichriſt, the Pope,
the Beaſt that keeps the Witneſſes in ſackcloth, to reigne, which is
1260. years, which time is up about, 1651. and then from the
time of the Beaſt of the Earth, the Beaſt that coms out of the
bottomleſſe pit, his reign which began in 1647. and continues
three years and an half; ſo that 'tis probable his reign will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired
in 1651. about the middle of this year, &amp; then 'tis probable
from his actions; for he throws down a lawfull and unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Magiſtracy, and then he moſt bitterly and violently perſecutes
the Miniſtery, which lawfull Magiſtracy and Miniſtery ſhall have
a mighty victory over him, and ſo riſe up to their former dignity
again; but immediately before this victory they muſt be in an
exceeding low condition, and in the eyes of the people of the
world paſt recovery. All this we have made out clearly from
Scripture; and how<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> clearly and manifeſtly theſe Scriptures are in
part fulfilld, &amp; haſtning to be accompliſhed, I leave to every ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded
man to judg; ſo that my merry Dr. that is ſo confident
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:117866:58"/>
of his holy Democracy, and holy Army, unleſſe he can prove
them to be the ſlain Witneſſes that were ſlain and perſecuted by
the Beaſt ariſing out of the bottomleſſe pit, and thrown down
and worn out by the little horn, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. that riſeth and reigneth
over three kingdoms (where the Goſpel is purely profeſſed) three
years and an half, in which time he changeth their Lawes and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms:
unleſſe he prove them ſo, out of his own mouth we ſhall
clearly overthrow him; for <hi>p.</hi> 33. 34. there he undertakes to prove
from <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 14. &amp; <hi>v.</hi> 27. that Monarchy ſhal be thrown down,
and now 'tis on the tragicall ſtage for that end, and all to make
way for Chriſts viſible Kingdom on earth: This honor of throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down Monarchy, and exalting Democracy, is given (he ſaith)
to his holy ones, according to that text <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 27. the kingdom,
and Dominion, and greatneſſe of the kingdom under the heaven
ſhall be given to the people of the Saints of the moſt high.</p>
            <p>Let me intreat the Reader to obſerve but the time when the
kingdom ſhall be given to the Saints, in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. it is at that time
<hi>(v. 8.)</hi> when the little horn that riſeth after the other ſtates ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Rome, and plucks up three of the firſt hornes or king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;
obſerve, this the Doctor confeſſeth is in the end of the
Roman Monarchy: if ſo (which is undeniable) then let all the
world judge, what little horn is lately roſe to uſurp three king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
is not this text viſibly fulfilled in the ſight of all <hi>Europe?</hi>
But then obſerve, <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10. Chriſt comes, (is in <hi>Rev. 10. 1, 2.)</hi> and in
<hi>v.</hi> 11. this little horn was ſlain, and given to the burning flame;
'tis the ſame with <hi>Rev.</hi> 19, 20. where he was caſt into the lake bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
and then <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14. Chriſt ſet up his Kingdom, which is both
a glorious and everlaſting kingdom; and <hi>v.</hi> 24, 25. this little horn
is cleerly deſcribed to be the Witneſſe ſlaying Beaſt, who ſhall
continue three years and an half, and then immediately followes
Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 26, 27. coming forth to deſtroy this Beaſt, and then as
in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. all the kingdoms in the world become Chriſts, &amp; <hi>Rev.</hi>
20. 4. thrones are ſet, &amp; then the Saints <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the Witneſſes ſit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them; ſo that the meaning is not that Chriſt will throw down
Kingly Government or Monarchy in the Church, but that he will
raiſe a godly Magiſtracy and a godly Miniſtery to a higher degree
of power then ever before, and thereby the reall Saints of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:117866:59"/>
God ſhall have greater freedome then formerly. The two
Witneſſes ſhall goe no more in ſackcloth, but put on white
linnen. 'Tis true, Uſurpers and Tyrants ſhall bee throwne
downe; the Tyrannicall Independent Monarcy of Rome ſhall
be thrown down, and the tyrannicall uſurped Democracy of
<hi>England</hi> ſhall be thrown down, who give the Beaſt of the Earth
their power and ſtrength, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 13. and with that ſtrength go
forth againſt the Lamb; and the Lamb ſhall overcome them, for
he is the King of kings, and Lord of lords; that's his Motto, in
<hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 19. When he fights againſt this Beaſt, and overcomes him,
'tis one and the ſame battel: theſe ſhall be overcome, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
for ever: but the Witneſses though they are ſlain, and the
Doctor and all the Antichriſtian Rabble make merry, and keep
Thankſgiving days: yet they ſhall ariſe again, ſtand upon their
legs, and aſcend in power and authority, and glory, above their
Enemies. But why do I ſtand to confute the Doctor when he
confutes himſelf in his own book, in <hi>p.</hi> 9. He approves that there
was Kingly Government from <hi>Noah;</hi> for <hi>Sem</hi> he ſaith was King
of <hi>Salem;</hi> and yet in <hi>p.</hi> 39. of the ſame book he accounts of Kings
as Antichriſtian, and ſaith, that they that uphold Kings, uphold
Antichriſt: ſo that by this account (as <hi>p.</hi> 22. confirms it, for there
he uſeth this as a motive to praſe, becauſe Monarchy is turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Democracie) it ſeems Antichriſtian power was in the World
as ſoon as <hi>Abraham,</hi> if Kings be Antichriſtian in the Church: But
why do I ſay ſo much, when I have heard the man within this
theſe two years in a publick Auditory, profeſs himſelf no Enemy
to Kingly Government or Monarchy, but onely to the exceſs of
Monarchy, and tyranny of Kings: and yet here he puts on with all
vehemency the people, to praiſe God for the deſtruction of
Kingly Government, and the promotion of Democracie.</p>
            <p>But why did I meddle at all with him who knoweth not what
he ſaith? For if we begin with him, we ſhall find him in a groſs
miſtake, he ſaith in <hi>p.</hi> 2. that we are now under the ſixth Seal, and
ſixth Trumpet of that Seal; and under the end of the fourth Viall
of that Trumpet or the fifth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:117866:59"/>
Whereas the ſixth Seal was opened, <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. 12. when <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi>
the great overthrew the Pagan Empire, and caſt out
of office all the perſecuting Tyrants both in <hi>Rome,</hi> and
throughout the Romane Empire, which was at leaſt 1300.
yeers ſince; and yet we are but under the opening the ſixth
Seal: whereas none of the Trumpets ſounded untill the ſixth
Seal was paſt, and the ſeventh Seal was opened, as is manifeſt
by <hi>Revel.</hi> 8. 1, 2. And as for the time of the ſixth Trumpet
ſounding, it was <hi>(Rev. 9. 14.)</hi> when the foure angels were let
looſe which were bound in <hi>Euphrates,</hi> that was when the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razens</hi>
and <hi>Turks</hi> began to be eminent for their victories, and
ſucceſſes in War, which was about 700. yeers ſince: and then
he ſaith we are under the fourth viall of the ſixth Trumpet.
Whereas tis evident, that not one of the vials are to be powred
out untill the 7th Trumpet ſoundeth, this I have proved
already. I'le onely adde this, that the ſeventh Trumpet is the
<hi>Alpha</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of the vials, and thats clear from theſe foure
Texts in <hi>Revel:</hi> 11. 15. There the ſeventh Trumpet ſounds,
and after that, <hi>v. 19. the Temple of God was opened in heaven and
then there were lightnings, and voices, and thundrings, and an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,
and great hail,</hi> that is, the vials of Gods wrath on his
enemies. And in <hi>Revel. 15. 5. The temple of the Tabernacle of the
Teſtimony in heaven was opened,</hi> and after that the ſeven Angels
powred out their vials; ſo that the ſeventh Trumpet ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before the Temple in heaven was open, muſt needs be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the vials were powred out. Thus the ſeventh Trumpet
is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And in <hi>Revel.</hi> 10. 7. compared with <hi>Revel:</hi> 16. 17. there
when the ſeventh Trumpet ſounded, the myſtery of God
ſhould be finiſhed; and when the ſeventh viall was powred
out, there came the ſame voice from the throne, and ſaid, It
is finiſhed: ſo that the ſeventh Trumpet both begins, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth
the vials on the enemies of the Church. So that by
this you may judge of the Doctors ſoundneſſe of judgement
in a prophetick Truth. Truly I do beleeve (excepting the
<hi>Ingagement)</hi> you ſhall ſcarce finde in ſo few words ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall
errors in any Hereticks writing whatſoever, as in
theſe few words of the Doctors, that I have repeated. And as
his <hi>theſis</hi> is, ſuch is his <hi>hipotheſis;</hi> as are his premiſſes, ſuch are
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:117866:60"/>
his concluſions, exceeding abſurd, and falſe; and therefore I
leave him. Here I intended to break off, but at I was ſhutting
up, a Book came newly to my hand, called, <hi>A Deſcription of
the Hiſtory of Europe from 1650. to</hi> 1710. I do not cenſure the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
for he ſpeaks modeſtly, and concerning the calling of
the Jews; what he ſpeaks on Scripturall grounds, he ſpeaks
both learnedly, and judiciouſly. But as for thoſe Aſtrologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
predictions, no where grounded on Scripture, I hold them
dangerous foperies, and no more to be credited then an old
wives fable, or <hi>Lillies</hi> Almanack, there is one great miſtake
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it, which I finde alſo in many other learned Authors, and
that is concerning the binding of Satan a thouſand yeers.
This miſtake of the Author makes him fall foule upon inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<hi>Alſted</hi> and <hi>Beucholclers,</hi> for <hi>Alſtedius</hi> and <hi>Beucholclers,</hi> and
ſeverall other learned men, do hold that there ſhall be a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
yeers felicity of the Church after the Dragon is bound,
and caſt into the bottomleſſe pit, they ſay, this time of the
Church her felicity ſhall begin about the yeer 1694. their
ground for it is from <hi>Dan: 12. 12. Bleſſed is he that cometh to the
1335 dayes, i. e.</hi> yeers: Now count from the time the daily ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
was taken away, which was (ſaith <hi>Brightman,</hi> and
others) in the yeer 360. now adde 1335. to 360. and it makes
1695. yeers. The moſt ſound and Scripturall opinion is on
theſe words of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that at the end of the 1290. dayes,
ſpoken of in <hi>v:</hi> 11 (which dayes are at an end this yeer 1650.)
then the Jews converſion ſhall be begun; and in 1695. they
ſhall be ſetled in their own Nation, under one King, this is
backed with undenyable Scripture out of the old Teſtament,
and the beginning of their Converſion neer 1650. is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
demonſtrated by Chriſt himſelf, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. in <hi>Luke</hi> 21.
in <hi>Mark.</hi> 13. in <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. and in many places in the <hi>Revel:</hi> as
<hi>Revel.</hi> 16. 17. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe they ſay, that after the 1000. yeers felicitie
and tranquillitie of the Church, the war of <hi>Gog</hi> &amp; <hi>Magog</hi> ſhall
beg in; which enemies ſhall be deſtroyed by Chriſts coming to
judgement: this opinion (ſaith he that confutes it) is far
wide from the true mark. For, ſaith he, the true number
(meaning I ſuppoſe, the time of the war of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:117866:60"/>
muſt begin, <hi>Anno</hi> 1072. at the Epiration of the former, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the thouſand yeers binding of Satan, which he holds to
begin at the incarnation of Chriſt, and laſted a thouſand
yeers; or at the deſtruction of the 2d. Temple by <hi>Titus, Anno</hi>
71. So that at the end of 1072. this Author ſaith the fight of
<hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> muſt begin: this time, he ſaith, is tearmed to
be a thouſand yeers, and is to be underſtood of that time
that the world ſhall laſt after 1072 in pag. 7. he ſaith, that
the Devill, and Antichriſtianity muſt be chained up in the
dungeon of hell for a thouſand yeers after the incarnation of
Chriſt; and then in the yeer of Chriſt 1000. muſt the devill,
and Romiſh Idolatry by the Popedome of <hi>Sylveſter</hi> 2d. be let
looſe to reign upon the earth, and tyrannize over the Church
for the moſt part of another thouſand yeers, even till <hi>Anno</hi>
1709. and after that the fifth Monarchy of Chriſt muſt be
erected, as afterwards he affirms.</p>
            <p>But to refute in a word this groſſe miſtake, we do affirm,
that this opinion is altogether groundleſſe, and meerly fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick;
for he brings not a word of Scripture to confirm his
opinion: nay, I muſt affirm 'tis altogether contrary to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For, 1. he makes Antichriſt to be in being from the
incarnation of Chriſt; which Antichriſt in the Apocaliptick
ſence, was not in being till 390 yeers after Chriſt, not untill
the fifth Trumpet ſounded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Revel.</hi> 9. 5. 2. He makes Antichriſt
to be chained up a thouſand yeers, and then to riſe again;
whereas the <hi>Revelation</hi> teſtifies the contrary, that when he
fals he ſhall be caſt into hell: <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 20. out of which there
is no redemption; and <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall fall like a milſtone into
the bottome of the Sea, which ſhall never be recovered again.
3. He detracts from the time of Antichriſts reign allotted by
the holy Ghoſt: for <hi>(Rev. 13. 5.)</hi> Antichriſt was to continue
1260. yeers, but this man allows him but 698. yeers, in all,
in which he diam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>trally oppoſeth the Scripture at concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Antichriſt. But concerning the devils being bound a
thouſand yeers from Chriſts incarnation, or 72. yeers after,
this is ſo apparently oppugnant to the Scriptures, that I do
admire that any that hath read the <hi>Revelations</hi> ſhould affirm
it. Yet is it not this mans opinion alone, but <hi>Brightman, Pareus
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:117866:61"/>
Andreas,</hi> and ſeverall other Writers are of, or neer the ſame
opinion.</p>
            <p>Which opinion I prove is abſolutely againſt plain texts of
Scripture; as for the firſt 300. yeers after Chriſt, the devil was
ſo looſe as that he ſate in the throne, the <hi>Romane</hi> throne, and
murthered the Saints, untill <hi>Conſtantine</hi> came. <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. And
then after <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Devil was not chained, though he
were caſt out of the <hi>Romane</hi> Throne. For <hi>Revel:</hi> 12. 13. 15. 17.
after his caſting down he perſecuted the Church, and caſt a
Flood of <hi>Arrian</hi> Hereſie after her, and he was wrath with the
Church, and went to make war with her: ſo that after <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi>
he was not chained. For in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 2. there the Devill
gave the Pope his power, and great Authority.</p>
            <p>Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ther was the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vill chained up, nor ſealed in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe
pit afterwards, for if we look downward into Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
we ſhall ſee the Popes the Devils familiars, or the devill
their familiar, how many of them were Conjurors, and how
frequently was the devill called to their greateſt enterpriſes?
the devill was as twere ſole Monark throughout the world,
a great while, from the year 500 to 1000. how did Ignorance
raign throughout the world, and afterward when the ſight
of the Goſpel began to look through the Clouds again, how
did the devill and his Inſtruments beſtir them to ſuppreſſe
that light, by cruell perſecutions, and ſo they have continued
untill this day, <hi>Germany, France, Holland, England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi>
at this day know how buſie the Devill is to overthrow the
Church by hereſies, to ſeduce them by temptations of all
ſorts, to inſnare them, and by his inhumane Butchers with a
potent hand to murther the poor Church, ſo that I ſuppoſe no
man will ſay that ſince the Incarnation of Chriſt, the devill
hath been bound a 1000 years, no ſcarce a thouſand dayes,
ſo that neither Hiſtory nor Scripture hold out any ſuch thing
as that Satan ſince Chriſts incarnation hitherto, hath been
bound a 1000 years, they are ſo far from it, that they abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
prove the contrary, ſo that now it falls happily in my
way to diſcourſe of that 6th. propoſition which long ſince I
laid down, <hi>(viz:)</hi> that the 1000 years binding of Satan, and
the 1000 years Raigning of the Witneſſes, doth not begin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:117866:61"/>
the great Battel be fought againſt the Beaſt, and the falſe
Prophet.</p>
            <p>It is cleer from the Text, that Satan is not bound untill
the Battel be fought againſt the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 20. And at that time Sathan is bound, for <hi>Rev:</hi> 20. 1.
2, 3. is coupled with a (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) to the former, to ſhew that the
Beaſt, the falſe Prophet, and the Dragon, go to deſtruction at
one and the ſame time. Indeed <hi>Beza</hi> tranſlates [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] <hi>deinde</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that, I know no reaſon for it, but in <hi>Bezas</hi> ſence, I have
this advantage, that he proves the Devill is bound after the
Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet are deſtroyed not before, but the
Beaſt and the falſe Prophet are not yet deſtroyed, therefore
the Devill hath not as yet been bound; but I ſhall follow the
vulgar tranſlation of [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] and read it [and] <hi>Rev:</hi> 20. 1, 2, 3.
In the firſt verſe you have the Angel that binds him, who is
diſcribed by his power, he hath the key of Hell, and a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
chain that is irreſiſtable force, this is none other but the
Lord Jeſus, he that fought the Battel againſt the Beaſt, and
the falſe Prophet, and deſtroyed them irrecoverably, the
ſame binds the Devil with an inviolable chaine, for a 1000
years, this binding with a chain is an expreſſion ſetting forth
the glorious Conqueſt that Chriſt ſhall get in the fight over
all his Enemies, the Devill ſhall be bound in a great chaine
and caſt into Priſon, and ſealed up there, and an inviolable
lock ſhall be hanged on the Priſon door for a 1000 years, <hi>v:</hi> 3.
You have the end of his ſhutting up, it is that he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Nations no more untill a 1000 years be expired, and
after that he muſt be looſed a little ſeaſon, hence you may
know that the devils kingdom is, &amp; where it is, it is amongſt
the kingdoms profeſſing the Goſpel, tis that of hereſie, and
blaſphemy, and hipocriſie, and lies, and deceit. Obſerve now
what immediately <hi>John</hi> ſaw after the binding of Satan, <hi>v: 4.
And I ſaw thrones, and they ſate upon them, and judgement was given
unto them, and I ſaw the ſouls of them that were cut off with the Ax,
for the teſtimony of Jeſus, and for the word of God; and ſome certain

Three things this Text cleerly holds out. 1. The ſeventh
Trumpet ſounding. 2. The ſlain witneſſes riſing. 3. The
Church her happy ſtate on earth, after the ſeventh Trumpet
ſounding, and the witneſſes riſing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I ſaw Thrones, and then ſate upon them: and judgement
was given unto them.</hi> This <hi>John</hi> ſaw after (obſerve the time)
the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet, and the Dragon were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.
The ſame we ſhall find in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 14. 22. and 27. There
the little horn that <hi>v:</hi> 27. ſpeaks great words againſt God,
wears out the Saints, and thinks to change times and laws,
all which are given into his hand a time, times, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
of times, after which the Judgment ſhall ſit, <hi>v:</hi> 29. and

to the Saints, in <hi>v:</hi> 27. the kingdom and dominion, and
greatneſſe of the kingdom under the whole Heaven, ſhall be
given to the people of the Saints of the moſt high, this is the
immediate conſequence of the deſtruction of the little horn,
which we have proved is the ſame with the Beaſt of the earth
<hi>Rev:</hi> 13. 11. and <hi>Rev:</hi> 11. 17. in <hi>Rev:</hi> 11. you find the ſame
thing expreſſed, that hower that the Beaſt that ſlew the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
was with his party deſtroyed, <hi>(v:</hi> 13. [7000] that is
many thouſand [men of name] that is of thoſe that were
numbred by their name, or accounted Saints for their
good ſucceſſe, and great repute that they have gotten, by
their Victories, or men that received the number of the beaſt
name in their hands and foreheads, the ingagers, when thoſe
were deſtroyed, the ſame houre the Witneſſes <hi>(v: 12.)</hi> aroſe,
were called up, and aſcended into Heaven in a Cloud, though
the expreſſion differ, yet the thing intended in the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is the ſame, for it ſets forth the high degree of exaltation,
to which the ſlain Witneſſes ſhould attain, they ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the reach of their enemies both in glory and power
throughout the world, at the ſame time when all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of the world are become the Lord and his Chriſts, <hi>ver:</hi>
26. The 24. Elders ſit in their ſeats, and rejoyce that Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

hath received his kingdom, and at the ſame time <hi>Rev: 19. v:</hi>
4, 5, 6. You have the ſame ſong, from the Throne and the
Elders, the meaning is, they keep Thankſgiving dayes,
for the riſing of the Witneſſes, this is all one with <hi>Dan:</hi> 7. 14.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:117866:62"/>
which is the immediate conſequence of the little horns de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
for there the kingdoms of the earth became Chriſts,
and here in the Text <hi>John</hi> ſaw Thrones, and Judgment was
given to them, rhat is to the Saints, now what Saints theſe
are to whom thoſe Thrones are given, <hi>John</hi> in the next words
declares, and I ſaw the Souls of them that were beheaded, or
(as <hi>Beza</hi> reads it) ſmitten with the Ax, for the teſtimony of
Jeſus, here are two infallible marks whereby to know that
thoſe that ſit on theſe thrones, are the ſlain Witneſſes; 1. By
their ſufferings they are beheaded. 2. By their actions which
was the cauſe of their ſufferings; It was for the teſtimony of
Jeſus, for finiſhing their Teſtimony, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 7. that the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
were cut off, this gives us a wonderfull clear Character
of the ſlain Magiſtracy, which by the Ax and the Sword were
removed cut of the way, when they were reſolved to root out
Popery, and to eſtabliſh true Religion, then comes the fatall
Ax and Sword, and removes theſe Witneſſes, this is ſo cleer
that he that will not be obſtinately blind muſt of neceſſity ſee
it fulfilled in his ſight this day, and poſitively conclude,
That the Magiſtracy of <hi>England</hi> is that Witneſſe that was
thus cut off, but then the Miniſtry you ſhall ſee in the next
clauſe. <hi>And which had not worſhipped the Beaſt, nor his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magt,
nor received his mark in their foreheads, or in their
hands.</hi> As the precedent clauſe ſets forth the Magiſtracy, by
their doings and ſufferings, ſo this clauſe ſeems to me, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
the Miniſters doings and ſufferings. Indeed the Engliſh
tranſlation ſeems to joyn it with the other, becauſe they leave
out the word [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,] or tranſlate it not right, few of the
Latine Tranſlations render it full enough, for it may well
be rendred, as I conceive, thus: and certain ſome who
have not adored the Beaſt, nor his Image, nor receives
his Mark, Theſe are thoſe that ſuffered for not acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Beaſts of the earths God <hi>Mauzzim</hi> his ſword power,
his new erected Government, they would not ſubmit to his
Government, nor ſubſcribe to his Ingagement, nor pray for
them, nor Preach for them.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſuffer for not ſubſcribing to the Government ſet up,
as the Magiſtracy ſuffered for oppoſing the ſetting of it up,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:117866:63"/>
here is a cleer diſcription of the two Witneſſes, by their ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
under the Beaſt of the earth for this Image, and number
and mark, can be attributed to nothing but the Beaſt of the
earths new Government, and way of eſtabliſhing it, ſo that
this Text cleerly tels us, 1. Who ſhall poſſeſſe the Throne,
<hi>viz:</hi> the Witneſſes ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing. 2. When it is, when the Beaſt the
falſe Prophet, and the Dragon are overthrown by Chriſt, and
when the Witneſſes ariſe up, and aſcend above their enemies
that ſlew them.</p>
            <p>This time is called <hi>v:</hi> 5. The firſt reſurrection for two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
firſt, to diſtinguiſh this time from the day of Judgment,
the laſt reſurrection, for that ſhall not be untill a thouſand
years after this reſurrection, (if in <hi>v: 7.)</hi> by a thouſand years
be meant a definite time, which is diſputable.</p>
            <p>2. It is called a reſurrection, becauſe this is the time of the
Witneſſes riſing from their ſlaine condition, and ſtanding
upon their legs again, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 11. A Covenant reformation,
of Covenanting reformers ſhall ſtand up again to the terror
of all that oppoſe it, this reſurrection of the witneſſes alluds
to that of Chriſt, for as the Witneſſes muſt be conformable to
Chriſt in their ſufferings, ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y of the reſurrection of the
Witneſſes ſhall produce ſuch like effects, for as after Chriſts
great and unexpected loud voice on the Croſſe, there was an
earth-quake, and the Vale of the Temple rent, that the holy
of holies might be ſeen of all, and the day was alſo a dark
day, ſo at the ſlaying of the Witneſſes, <hi>Rev:</hi> 11. 13. there ſhall
be a great earthquake, and loud voices crying, It is finiſhed,
it ſhall be a dark day, and the Temple of the Tabernacle of
the teſtimony in Heaven ſhall be opened, and the Jews ſhall
riſe out of their ſpiritual graves of unbelief, as the fore-cited
texts tell us.</p>
            <p>And as at Chriſts reſurrection, an Angel appeared like
lightening and his raiment as white as ſnow, and Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
on the Mount with his diſciples, <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 16. And
makes known his monarchicall power, making his Diſciples
Apoſtles, and ſending them forth to conquer the world, ſo
ſhall it be at the Witneſſes riſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the glorious Angel ſhall
appear, the earth ſhall quake, the Soldiers that ſlew the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:117866:63"/>
ſhall quake: the Lamb and his ſealed ones ſhall ſtand
on Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and Chriſts power by his Witneſſes, ſucceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
progreſſe againſt his enemies, ſhall be manifeſt to the
world. And to this I might adde another Reaſon why tis
called a reſurrection; becauſe at this time God will call the
Jews out of their graves of unbelief, unto ſpirituall life by
ſubjecting them to the Goſpel. As, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 12, 13. in thoſe
two verſes he promiſeth foure times to call them out of their
graves, <hi>v:</hi> 9. from the foure winds. And <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 1, 2. after the
Beaſt that ſets up the god <hi>Mazzim</hi> is deſtroyed in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of holineſſe, that is, the Beaſt that ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ys the Witneſſes is
deſtroyed in that kingdom, where the Goſpel Magiſtracie,
Goſpel Miniſtery, Goſpel ordinances, and Goſpel purity is
preſerved, then immediately follows the ſeventh Trumpet,
where Chriſt ſtands up for the people; and at that time the
Jews ſhall be delivered, and they that ſleep in the duſt ſhall
awake; the Jews that have long lyen in the duſt ſhall awake,
they ſhall be brought from unbeleif to make profeſſion of the
Goſpel. Though all ſhall not be internally called to everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſalvation, yet they ſhall all be called into an externall
profeſſion: ſo that in theſe reſpects I conceive this time of
the Enemies overthrow. And the Church her riſing may well
be called the firſt reſurrection after theſe three grand Enemies
deſtruction within the Church; the Church ſhall have a large
time of freedome, from ſpirituall enemies, as from Hereticks,
and Idolaters, and blaſphemers, which are the proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of theſe three Arch Enemies. And after this large time
of tranquillity, both to the Jews and Gentiles, <hi>v:</hi> 7, 8. Satan
ſhall gather both open and ſecret, covered and uncovered
Enemies, <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> in infinite numbers againſt the
Saints: And then <hi>v:</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13. comes abſolutely the day
of judgement: And then the ſtate of the Saints in perfect and
eternall bliſſe, and happineſſe is ſet forth in <hi>Revel:</hi> 21. but of
the day of judgement, and the ſtate of bliſſe, Ile daily medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,
and forbear to write at this time.</p>
            <p>There is onely one Queſtion that I intend to anſwer, and
then Ile ſhut up this Diſcourſe, and that is, ſince the Beaſt of
the Sea is at <hi>Rome,</hi> and hath his r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſidence there, and the Beaſt
of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:117866:64"/>
the earth is now in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the devill is reigning tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout
the world, either by Paganiſme, or Mahomatiſme, or
Popiſh Idolatry, or by Independencie, under which Banner
he leads his troops of Traitors, and ſquadrons of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
and Hereticks, how ſhall all theſe be overthrown at one
ſet battell about this yeer 1651. ſince tis impoſſible all theſe
three Enemies ſhall be at the battell in perſon.</p>
            <p>The Queſtion is ſomewhat hard to be determined poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
yet this is clear from the Scripture, that this great bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
<hi>Revel:</hi> 19. 19, 20. is that battell that ſhall be fought by
the Witneſſes after they are riſen from their ſlain condition,
and this battell is fought againſt the Beaſt that ſlays the
Witneſſes, that is, the Beaſt of the Earth, that little Horn in
<hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 26, 27. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 4, 5. and againſt the Beaſt of the
bottomleſſe pit, and his company which makes merry, <hi>(Rev.
11. 10.)</hi> for the deſtruction of the Witneſſes; now how can it
be ſaid that when this Beaſt and his party are overcome,
that then the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet, and the Dragon
are over-come? <hi>A.</hi> 1. To this we anſwer in two words. 1.
They may virtually, and potentially all three fall when one
fals: ſo the whole hoſts of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> fell when <hi>Goliah</hi> fell.
2. Then when this Beaſt of the Earth fals, all the three begin
to fall, and from that day never riſe more; their chief plots
and devices ſhall be diſcovered, and broken, and their vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanie
ſhall be diſcovered to the whole world, which ſhall
make the ten Horns to hate the Whore, and burn her with
fire. Or who can tell but that at this battell the cheif ſtrength
of the Pope, the grand Hereticks who are the devils Eſquires,
and the cheif and grand Traitors againſt the Laws, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of <hi>England,</hi> may be all in that battell overcome? Or
thus, at three Kings in one perſon, by the Beaſt of the earth,
were overthrown, ſo the three grand enemies of the Church
in that one perſon of the Beaſt of the earth, may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown.
And to me it is very probable, in <hi>Revel:</hi> 17. where
<hi>John</hi> ſaw <hi>Rome</hi> in that year, when ſhe was to go to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in <hi>v:</hi> 3. He ſaw the laſt Beaſt that did bear up <hi>Rome,</hi> and
uphold her in her pomp, the Beaſts is called <hi>v:</hi> 8. the Beaſt
that cometh out of the bottomleſſe pit, to let us know that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:117866:64"/>
that Beaſt which ſlaies the Witneſſes, bears up <hi>Rome,</hi> when
ſhe is going to damnation: this Beaſt, <hi>v:</hi> 3. is called the Beaſt
bearing up <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe he ſlays the Witneſſes that would
have pulled down <hi>Rome,</hi> he is called therefore a ſcarlet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
Beaſt, becauſe of his bloody cruelty againſt the true
Church, and then he is ſaid to have ſeven Heads, and ten
Horns; becauſe he ſupports that City <hi>Rome,</hi> with ſeven
Heads and ten Horns; Popery by the Covenanteers had
long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ince been in the duſt, but that he broke the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers
and their Reformation by his bloody treaſon, and his
blaſphemous troops. So then as this Beaſt is ſaid to bear up
<hi>Rome,</hi> though he be far diſtant from <hi>Rome,</hi> by his ſlaying
<hi>Romes</hi> enemies; ſo <hi>Rome</hi> may be ſaid to fall, and the Pope
may be ſaid to fall; and the Devil who is ſaid to be the father
of Hereticks, and blaſphemers may be ſaid to fall, when he
that hath ſupported them fals; And in this ſence at this bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
when this Beaſt is overthrown, the Beaſt, and that falſe
Prophet, and the Dragon may be ſaid to fall: and be ſure of
it, when the Witneſſes have got their victories over this
Beaſt down goeth Popery, and blaſphemie, and hereſie: ſo
that though in the downfall of this Beaſt of the earth it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſaid, that the Pope, and the Devil ſhall perſonally, and
univerſally in their power be overthrown, yet it may truly
be ſaid that virtually they are overcome, it may well and
truly be ſaid, that the Pope and the Devil are overcome when
this Beaſt is overcome; becauſe the Beaſt is the ſupport of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
by which <hi>Romes</hi> pomp is ſupported, and the ſupport of
Hereticks and blaſphemers, by whom the Devils kingdom is
upheld, hath he not cauſed thoſe to fall who went about to
overthrow <hi>Rome?</hi> and hath he not granted a toleration to all
Hereticks to lord it over the orthodox Chriſtians? Who is ſo
blinde as doth not ſee that he doth ſupport this day the ſtate,
pomp, and Religion of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the Divels kingdom;
there Satans throne is where the Witneſſes are ſlain. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
            <p>In a word, it may truly be ſaid, when the Beaſt of the earth is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown,
that then the Popes cauſe and intereſt, and the Devills intereſt,
will with him be overthrown in theſe three kingdoms: for who is it, but
he that hinders the Covenant-reformation, and if he ſhall by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanteers
(as I do undoubtedly believe he will, when his three years and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:117866:65"/>
a halfs Raign is up) be overcome, be aſſured that the riſing Witneſſes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting
the ends of the Covenant, will be the ruine of the Popes and the
devils Kingdom in <hi>England.</hi> Indeed the Tenor of the Covenant is nothing
elſe, but to eſtabliſh the Witneſſes, and throw down Popery and Hereſie,
that is, the Pope and the Devils kingdom. Shall I yet go a little further,
I am confident that when this Beaſt of the earth is overcome, his curſed
Helliſh conſpiracies with the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Court of <hi>Spaine</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
the Kings of <hi>Europe,</hi> that acknowledg not the Popes ſupremacie,
will be made ſo apparent, that all the Kings in <hi>Europe</hi> eſpecially <hi>France,</hi>
and <hi>Portugall,</hi> and theſe thre Kingdoms, <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi>
will both abominate, and utterly reject the Romiſh Court, as a den of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable
Theeves and Murtherers; And I truſt, utterly forſake that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed
Religion, which can change it ſelf into any ſhape, and pretend any
intereſt on purpoſe to overthrow kingdoms, and murther Kings.</p>
            <p>Now put all theſe together, conſider but from the time of the Popes
riſing, when he got to be the head of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be independent, which (as
on all hands is concluded) was about the yeer 390. and conſider but the
time of the Beaſts of the earth, who riſeth out of Independency, and ſlaies
the Witneſſes in the yeer 1647. conſider how cleerly the holy Ghoſt
holds out the Beaſt in his riſing, in his government, in his time of duration
and in the manner, and place of his ruine: compare but Scripture with
Scripture, compare <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. and 11. and <hi>Matth. 24, Mark 13. Luke 21. Rev.</hi>
11. the 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. Chapters, and <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. together with
ſeverall other Texts in <hi>Ezek:</hi> and <hi>Iſiah:</hi> I ſay compare the ſeverall texts,
as we have ſet them one with another, and compare with theſe texts, the
occurrences of theſe three yeers laſt paſt, in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and from all it may be concluded (I would fain ſay poſitively) probably,
that immediately after 1650. is ended, when the Beaſt of the earth, hath
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aged a Prophetick day, (that is) one year in <hi>Scotland,</hi> then comes the
ruine of the Church her enemies, for then the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> time of
keeping the Witneſſes in Sackcloath is expired, and the three years and
an half of the great Independent Beaſt, that ſhall ſlay the Witneſſes is
expired, then he and his Poliarchy of Senators, who Raign as Kings, muſt
go to their eternall graves, and then the Witneſſes muſt riſe, and take
poſſeſſion of their ſeats from which they were thrown, and the Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-reformation
by them muſt be carried on to the utter deſtruction of
the Pope, and his faction, and the binding of the devil, and utter caſting
of him out of the Church with his faction. All which the Lord of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
mercy through Jeſus Chriſt for his elect ſake (both of Jews and
Gentiles unconverted, and alreadie converted) haſten. <hi>Even ſo come Lord
