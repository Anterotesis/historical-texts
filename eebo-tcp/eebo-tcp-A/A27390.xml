            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE kindness you have for
an <hi>Apostate</hi> (for certainly <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
was never better treated
than by you) makes me think <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius</hi>
hath a particular title to your
Protection, especially since we are
sure he revolted to <hi>Arrianism,</hi> and
not to <hi>Popery.</hi> Now whether these
kind sentiments proceed from a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusive
Charity, or rather a Natural
inclination whereby every thing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
its like, I shall not presume
to determine, though the latter is

               </gap>he more probable, since, like <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
you took holy Orders, and like
him too have, in effect at least, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
a Passive Crucified Saviour: this
will be plain to any one that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately
reades your book, and is
the onely thing hath induc'd me to
say what I have; for I declare I am
wholly unacquainted with any thing
that belongs to you, but <hi>that,</hi> your
<hi>Name</hi> and your <hi>Character</hi> in the
Church; so that no personal grudge
could be the occasion of these pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers;
but a just sense of what I owe
to my Religion, and the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
under which I live; from
which I ill deserve the Protection
and Liberty I enjoy, if I should not
use my utmost endeavour to sustain
it, when it is so evidently supplanted
(as now it is) by your pernicious
principles. And I cannot think but
your Religion is as indifferent to
you, as you would have the World
believe that of the <hi>Rippon-</hi>Addressers
<pb facs="tcp:40781:3"/>
is to them, since you so palpably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plode
the glorious end of it <hi>Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I say this after a due and carefull
reading of your papers; and I was
more exact in the perusal, because
your prejudic'd friends gave it out,
that your book ought to be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
measure of our conduct in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his R. H. and the true State
of that Civil Obedience we owe to a
Tyrant; and added likewise, that
the Authorities you quoted were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable,
your inferences and
deductions necessary and pertinent,
and your arguments unanswerable:
but after the most diligent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
search, not a syllable of all
this appear'd; and indeed when I
considered the Vouchers, I laught at
my self for giving credit to any thing
they so confidently asserted, since o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

say, with the same precaution they
believe women, or interpret dreams;
<pb facs="tcp:40781:4"/>
and indeed they have that quality of
great Lyars to have the contrary of
what they affirm generally true.</p>
            <p>I hope, Sir, you will not take this
for a too severe reflexion upon your
friends; I am sure they value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon these pious artifices; and
it would have been unkind in them,
when you had taken so much pains
in publishing so many notorious fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
to advance the cause, if they had
not advanc'd the credit of your book
by the same means. After these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome
truths I can expect little
favour from you, and indeed entreat
none; all that I desire is, that you
would reade this as patiently as I did
yours, and then, if you please, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
as freely: but of all faults, I am
confident you have no reason to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse

                  </gap>ius,</hi>
as is observ'd in <hi>Julian's;</hi> it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to take a view of the Preface to that
Book, that I may clear all things as I go, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
nothing unanswer'd, that has the least ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of an argument. And that, what
he urges may more evidently appear, I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the force of all he says, to these following
Propositions, and give my answers to them
distinctly.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The <hi>Rippon-</hi>Addressers are very solicitous,
lest his Majesty should agree to the Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
(<hi>pag. 4.</hi>) and thence infers, that if they
were Protestants, they were men weary of their
Religion, <hi>p. 6.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. The Primitive Christians conduct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to that of the Addressers.</item>
               <item>3. If they had known <hi>Julian's</hi> Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Constantius's</hi> Death, he had not succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<hi>p. 7.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <pb facs="tcp:40781:5"/>4. Passive Obedience necessary for the first
Christians, because the Laws were against
them; (<hi>p. 7.</hi>) but not for those under <hi>Julian,</hi>
because they had the Laws on their side; for
when 'tis prescrib'd without Law, and against
Law, 'tis Mahumetan (<hi>p. 8.</hi>)</item>
               <item>5. Passive Obedience contrary to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel;
this he pretends to prove from <hi>1 Cor. 7.
21, 22, 23 verses,</hi> with Dr. <hi>Hammond's</hi>
Paraphrase: and by the example of St. <hi>Paul,
Act. 22. 25, 26, &amp;c. 16. 39, &amp;c. p. 9.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>6. Passive Obedience contrary to the Law of
the Land.</item>
            </list>
            <p>As to the first of these.</p>
            <p>I don't find the Addressers of <hi>Rippon</hi> are
fond of a Popish, but a lawfull Successour: and
if Mr. <hi>Johnson</hi> infers from their aversion to
the Bill of Exclusion, that they are weary of
their Religion; certainly he doth not think
them Protestants now. For what can be a
greater mark of that sacred profession, than to
be severely cautious to prevent an Action that
would be contrary to all Laws divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane?
They are strangers to that way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
their Religion, by acting contrary to
the dictates of it; and will hardly venture to
doe an unjust thing now, that they may go qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
to Church hereafter. Certainly we are not
by this means to avoid Persecution; this is
nothing else, but preferring the eternal torments
of the next world, before the little pressures of
<pb facs="tcp:40781:5"/>
this, and leaping into Hell to avoid the Cross.
I should have made a far different construction
of this Address; for if the Gentlemen of <hi>Rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon</hi>
were sure his R. H. were a Papist (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
no man yet ever made a legal proof) yet
what they did was their duty; for they knew
<hi>Imperatores bonos voto expetendos, quales<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque
tolerandos:</hi> And that this was the
opinion of the Primitive Christians, as well as
<hi>Tacitus.</hi> Which will be more fully made out
in my answer to the second Position, which is,
<hi>That the Conduct of the Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
was quite contrary to that of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will be hard to reconcile this saying of his,
not onely to truth, but sense; for if the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Christians acted quite contrary to the
Addressers, then when these made it their
humble Petition to his Majesty not to exclude
his R. H. they supplicated to <hi>Constantius</hi> to
put by <hi>Julian;</hi> but this was not so, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
assures us (<hi>p. 18.</hi>) so that his saying the
Primitive Christians acted contrary to the
Gentlemen of <hi>Rippon,</hi> when he acknowledges
they did nothing at all, must either be non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense,
or made out by a new definition of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries.</p>
            <p>But I will suppose he means had the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
known <hi>Julian's</hi> Apostacy, they would have
us'd all possible means to have prevented hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
coming to the Empire. Which is the substance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
the third Position to be answered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40781:6"/>
Certainly he ought to have good grounds for
this assertion, and know of some presidents of
their precluding the next Heir upon the account
of Heresie or Apostacy; or at least that it is
manifest, from some principles they own'd, that
they would, if it had lain in their power: If
he knows any thing of this nature, he would
doe well to inform the world of it, and give us
a second Edition of his Book, which onely such
an Addition could make considerable. For in
his Preface he gives no reason at all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>for what
he asserts; and in the second Chapter of his
Book, where proofs of this kind would be very
necessary, he onely tells as that <hi>Gregory Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen</hi>
[highly before disoblig'd by <hi>Julian</hi>] in
an invective long after his death tells <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius</hi>
[then in Heaven] that he did ill in
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ving and making <hi>Julian</hi> King; who was
both ill sav'd, and made an ill King: and
then concludes, <hi>Constantius</hi> would not have
done so, if he had known <hi>Julian's</hi> Apostacy.
Sure this Gentleman has had the misfortune
that the Christian's Children had under <hi>Julian,</hi>
to be deny'd the use of Logick and Rhetorick;
for how else could he make such an absurd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
or understanding the nature of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective,
undertake to deduce a concluding ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
from any thing that is deliver'd in one?
I declare, (though I have the greatest venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the Holy Fathers imaginable, and
especially for that great Name <hi>Gregory Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen</hi>)
yet I cannot think it my duty strictly
<pb facs="tcp:40781:6"/>
to believe all they say in the height of a Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick,
or an Invective; there are certain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances
to be made in our belief of Speeches,
that are the effects of either kindness or anger;
and the distinction may not be improperly ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mitted,
between the Father, and the Oratour:
but this will be more evident, to any impartial
man, when I shall prove that many things in
<hi>Gregory's</hi> Invective said in favour of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius,</hi>
or against <hi>Julian,</hi> are not precisely
true: for every one knows <hi>Constantius</hi> had
faults; for 'tis acknowledg'd (<hi>p. 29.</hi>) that he
was guilty of the Murther of his kindred and
innovation in matters of Faith (for 'tis there
said he repented of these things at his death)
and I shall add, of a severe Persecution (which
will be seen anon.) Granting this to be true,
how could he justly merit this Complement from
<hi>Gregory? You were led by the hand of God
into every counsel and enterprize, whose
wisedom was admir'd above your power, and
again your power, more than your wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
but your piety was valued above
them both.</hi> (Greg. Inv.)</p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Johnson</hi> thinks this deservedly said
of <hi>Constantius,</hi> he must either think all Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that give us an account of that unhappy
Emperour's life, fabulous, or entitle God to his
Apostacy; but I suppose he is not arriv'd to
that height of folly, to believe the former, or of
impiety, to admit of the latter. 'Tis probable he
will rather conform to the general opinion of
<pb facs="tcp:40781:7"/>
all understanding men, that <hi>Gregory</hi> did, and
might say more in an Invective, than would be
allowable in a History or a Sermon.</p>
            <p>Again, that he should make the Devil steal
in along with the Consult (<hi>p. 25.</hi>) can onely
be imputed to the uncontrollable liberty of an
Invective; for St. <hi>Austin</hi> tells us, God that
gave the Empire to the Christian Prince <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi>
gave it also to <hi>Julian</hi> the Apostate.
Those things without doubt, that <hi>One</hi> and the
<hi>True</hi> God doth govern and rule as he pleaseth,
by causes, although hidden, yet not unjust.
(<hi>Aug.</hi> de Civ. <hi>D. 5. c. 21.) Origen</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
tells us, that bad and good Princes are
both the gift of God, <hi>Si mali sunt actus nostri,
&amp; operamur malignum in conspectu dei;
dantur nobis principes secundum cor no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum.</hi>
[Orig. in lib. Iud. Hom. <hi>4.</hi>] Now
which is in the right, St. <hi>Austin</hi> or <hi>Gregory,</hi>
let any man judge. But farther, can any man
believe that the Father spoke in earnest, when
he tells <hi>Constantius</hi> he did ill to save <hi>Julian,
(p. 23.)</hi> i. e. he had done well if he had Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
him (for there is no difference in the
Court of Conscience, between doing an injury
your self, and permitting it to be done by others,
if it lye in your power to prevent it,) if by that
means he had prevented his succession; since
'tis contrary, not onely to Scripture, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
prudence, to prevent a future inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
by a present ill, and by a sin endeavour to
avert onely a possible misfortune.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40781:7"/>I can't tell how difficult it is to satisfie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
people; but for my own part, I think, I
can justly conclude from these instances, that
every thing in <hi>Gregory's</hi> Invective, is not to
be urg'd for proof: And this doth not at all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
from the truth and sincerity of his
other works, because the nature of the thing
gives him liberties now; which, as they are not
allowable in his other Writings, so neither are
they usual.</p>
            <p>But certainly nothing in the world is more
senseless and ridiculous, than that which
Mr. <hi>Johnson</hi> urges to enhanse the credit of
this Invective (<hi>p. 27.</hi>) where he says the things
[concerning <hi>Julian</hi>] were not deliver'd coldly,
and nakedly set down, but with an <hi>Emphasis,</hi>
and the greatest vehemency: For all people
know, the passion they were deliver'd with,
ought to make us suspect the truth of them;
for angry men often speak what they don't
think themselves; they do not consider what
ought to be said, but what makes most against
their enemy; and their fury improves every
thing into a weapon to serve their revenge:
For I would fain know of Mr. <hi>Johnson,</hi>
which he thinks more exactly true, <hi>Tully's</hi>
Offices, or his Philippicks; and yet how
nakedly and coldly one is deliver'd, and
with what vehemence and pomp of words the
other, is easily seen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40781:8"/>
               <hi>Therefore (with all submission) I think</hi>
Gregory's <hi>authority in this Invective, ought
to have no more weight with us, than</hi> Grotius
<hi>allows to the sayings of Orators</hi> [Prol. l. 1.
de Ju. Bel. &amp; Pa.] Nos saepe iis utimur, non
tam ut inde astruamus fidem, quam ut his
quae dicere volumus, ab ipsorum dictis, ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid
ornamenti accedat.</p>
            <p>I can hardly imagine that Holy Father
himself, had he been at the Consult, would
have encourag'd <hi>Constantius</hi> to exclude <hi>Julian,</hi>
though he knew his Apostacy; because it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be easily suppos'd, that he would coolly have
done an Action, contrary to the Law of Nature:
the reveal'd word of God: and the practice
of the Primitive Christians.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That the Exclusion of</hi> Julian, <hi>would have
been contrary to the Law of Nature, may be
gather'd from what Mr.</hi> Johnson <hi>says of his</hi>
Title to the Crown (<hi>p.</hi> 19.) viz. <hi>that it was
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, so that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
this, must needs be a great breach of
the Law of Nature, which cannot be allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
upon any Consideration; for a Heathen
will tell us,</hi> Nec derogari aliquid ex hâc
[lege naturae] licet, neque tota abrogari
potest: neque verò per Senatum, aut per

[<hi>This is quoted</hi> Lact. 6. Inst. 8. <hi>out of</hi> Cic.
<hi>Books</hi> de Repub. <hi>that are lost.</hi>] <hi>If this be
true (which I am sure no man of common
knowledge will deny) what becomes of the
lawfulness of Excluding</hi> Julian? <hi>'Twould have
been equally as just to have prevented his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
hy death as any other means; for any
thing tending to this had been a breach of the
Law of Nature, and would onely differ from
the former, as robbing a man doth, from cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Throat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That such an attempt is contrary to the
reveal'd Law of God, may necessarily be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
from the exact agreement there is between
the Scriptures and the Law of Nature; <hi>This,</hi>
being onely <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>legis illius architypae &amp;
aeternae quae est immensè divina;</hi> and <hi>those,</hi>
his reveal'd will: but 'tis expresly set down in
Scripture, that the Right of Succession is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd
on Primogeniture; for <hi>Gen. 49. 3.</hi>
when <hi>Jacob</hi> blessed his sons, he call'd <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben</hi>
his first-born the Excellency of dignity,
and the Excellency of power; and in
<hi>2 Chron. 21. 3.</hi> 'tis said, that <hi>Jehoram</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<hi>Jehosaphat,</hi> because he was the first<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born.
<pb facs="tcp:40781:9"/>
I might fill my Margin with quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to this purpose, but I shall onely add that
great instance of the Right of Primogeniture,
<hi>Gen. 4. 7.</hi> where God tells <hi>Cain</hi> of his younger
brother <hi>Abel, Unto thee shall be his desire,
and thou shalt rule over him;</hi> which are
the very words which God spake <hi>Chap. 3.
v. 16.</hi> when he gave the man dominion over
the woman. Now that this right extends to
proximity of blood, no body questions; so that
unless we have some warrant from Scripture to
res<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ind this title, it is the highest sacrilege
imaginable to attempt it; and I challenge all
the world to shew where that warrant is. God
himself, indeed, may dispose of the right that
he first gave; but I would fain know what
people could ever lawfully pretend to alter the
Succession, without an express warrant from
God? <hi>David,</hi> I confess, made <hi>Solomon</hi>
King, but he declares 'twas by God's immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ppointment; <hi>and of all my sons, for the
Lord hath given me many sons, he hath
chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the
Throne of the kingdom of the Lord over
Israel, 1</hi> Chron. <hi>28. 5.</hi> Now I shall readily
grant the Authour of <hi>Julian's</hi> friends, <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasts;</hi>
but I can hardly admit they have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<hi>revelation</hi> for what they would now be
at; and without this, I think the Exclusion
of the Next Heir utterly unlawfull.</p>
            <p>And that this was the sense of the first
Christians, will be evident from the Apology
<pb facs="tcp:40781:9"/>
of <hi>Athenagoras</hi> to <hi>M. Aurelius,</hi> and his son
<hi>Commodus:</hi> where having declar'd the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
were of all others most piously inclin'd
toward God and their Empire, he concludes
with this profession: <hi>We pray for your Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
that the Son (as it is most fit) may
in the Kingdom succeed the Father, and that
your Empire may encrease and flourish, all
being made subject to you, which would be
much for our good, that we leading a quiet
and peaceable life, may readily obey you in
all your Commands.</hi> I think nothing can be
fuller than this to prove what I design'd, for
that in these words he declar'd the sense of the
Church, we must necessarily grant, if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what his Character then was, when he
spake them. <hi>Athe. Legat. pro Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to come nigher to the business in hand;
the Primitive Christians did know <hi>Julian's</hi>
Apostacy, before <hi>Constantius</hi> died: For as
soon as ever he was declar'd Emperour by the
Souldiers, he laid by all pretence to Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
for going through every City, he open'd
the Temples, and call'd himself the High
Priest (<hi>Soz.</hi>) So that, like Mr. <hi>Johnson,</hi> he
did not lay by the name of Priest, though he
turn'd Apostate. Now that the Army should
be ignorant of what <hi>Julian</hi> did so publickly in
the face of the Sun, is not to be imagin'd;
especially if <hi>Constantius</hi> himself knew it;
which Mr. <hi>Johnson</hi> would have us believe,
from the passage he cites from <hi>Gregory Naz.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40781:10"/>
that <hi>Constantius</hi> repented his declaring <hi>Julian</hi>
his Successour; which could onely be upon the
account of his Apostacy, so that he must needs
know it.</p>
            <p>But if we give any credit to <hi>Marcellinus</hi>
(whose authority I am sure Mr. <hi>Johnson</hi> seems
much to value) if <hi>Constantius</hi> did know that
<hi>Julian</hi> was a <hi>Pagan,</hi> it was impossible he should
repent of his leaving him his Successour: for he
tells us (<hi>l. 21.</hi>) that upon his falling sick he
did in his right understanding <hi>[integro sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su]</hi>
nominate <hi>Julian</hi> his heir, and (<hi>l. 22.</hi>) with
his last breath [<hi>supremâ voce</hi>] pronounc'd hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Emperour: Now that he spoke or shew'd any
signs of his repentance after his death,
Mr. <hi>Johnson</hi> will hardly allow, because that
looks too like a Popish Miracle.</p>
            <p>I am rather inclin'd to believe that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius</hi>
thought the Right of Succession was
so inviolable, that the highest provocation ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
ought not to prevail with him to alter
it; for else why did he not endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
him, when he had been guilty of the
highest ingratitude, in procuring himself to be
declar'd Emperour by the Army, and af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erwards
in justifying his title by an open rebellion? It
had certainly been but justice to have proceeded
with the greatest rigour against him for so inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
an Vsurpation. But alas! he knew his
Edicts in this case would be superseded by a
greater Law, and that they would be of little
force against that title from which he first
deriv'd the power to make them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40781:10"/>
I hope this is a sufficient answer to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Chapter, wherein Mr. <hi>Johnson</hi> pretends
to shew the sense of the Primitive Christians
about <hi>Julian's</hi> Succession, but makes one man's
opinion the sense of the whole Church, and
takes that opinion too of his, from his Invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives:
this is so dis-ingenuous, it could never
be excus'd: but that the badness of the cause
he is engag'd in, can find nothing else to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it.</p>
            <p>As to the fourth Position, that <hi>Passive
Obedience was necessary for the first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
because the Laws were against them,
but not to those under</hi> Iulian, <hi>because the
Laws were for them.</hi> I answer; that this
distinction is frivolous; for since the will of
their Emperour was a Law (as <hi>Gregory</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
<hi>In. p. 92.</hi>) if they were executed by
his Command, they died lawfully. But I shall
refer the farther proof of this to a particular
Chapter of Passive Obedience.</p>
            <p>But since he urges the Authority of holy
Scripture to confirm what he says in this place,
we must, for method sake, take notice of it:
which is the fifth thing to be answer'd,
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> Passive Obedience is contrary to the
Gospel, <hi>as may be seen</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 21, 22, 23
<hi>verses, with Dr.</hi> Hammond's <hi>Paraphrase.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis very strange, that when our Saviour so
often recommends sufferings to us as our duty,
and the badge of our profession, that quietly
<pb facs="tcp:40781:11"/>
and patiently submitting to them, should be
contrary to the Gospel; certainly he has a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Bible to himself; for we find in ours,
that suffering is particularly the business of the
Gospel; and is the great concluding beatitude,
(<hi>Mat. 5. 11.</hi>) nay 'tis evident that misery and
persecution were first entail'd on Christianity;
for the <hi>Jews</hi> had the prospect of Temporal bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings:
Riches and honours were the lot of their
inheritance; but we are commanded to take up
the Cross, and despise the shame of it, that
thereby we might imitate him, who condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be our great exemplar: But however,
it will not be amiss to see what Reason he has
for this monstrous assertion; and because every
one has not Dr. <hi>Hammond's</hi> Paraphrase at
hand (which I am confident is the reason he
quoted it) I shall give it you here with the
Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>V.</hi> 21. Art thou call'd being a servant?
care not for it: but if thou mayst be made
free, use it rather.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Para.</hi> [In what condition of life soever a
man is, when he is converted to Christianity,
let him contentedly continue in it, and not
think that Christian Religion frees a man from
any obligation that lay upon him before; for
that is to make Christian Religion a pretence
to covetousness, or lust, or secular advantages,
(see <hi>1 Tim. 6.</hi>) if either being a Christian might
manumit a servant, or free a husband, or a
wife from former obligation. He therefore that
<pb facs="tcp:40781:11"/>
being a bondman is converted to Christianity,
must not think that it is any disparagement to
his Christianity, that he continues a servant
still, nor be solicitous of changing his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Yet this is not so to be understood, but
that if by any fair regular means, he can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his freedom, he may then make use of them,
and prefer liberty before servitude; for so he
might have done, had he never been a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ver.</hi> 22. For he that is call'd in the Lord,
being a servant, is the Lord's freeman; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
he that is call'd, being free, is Christ's
servant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Para.</hi> [For he that being in the condition
of a servant, is converted to Christianity, doth
by his conversion become a freeman in respect
of Christ; not that he ceases to be a servant
to his former master, or reaps any secular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
thereby, but his advantages are spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
<hi>viz.</hi> that by being a Christian he is
freed from many servitudes, that of sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
that lye upon all others; and to live in Christ's
family as one of his freemen, though in respect
of the world he continue as a servant. And
so on the other side, he that is a freeman, and
turns Christian, becomes thereby a servant of
Christ's, undertaking Obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
though he lose not his liberty in the
world by that means. (By which 'tis clear,
that Christ meddles not with the secular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of this world, nor changes any man's
<pb facs="tcp:40781:12"/>
outward condition by his becoming Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.)]</p>

            <p>Certainly Mr. <hi>Johnson</hi> has a different Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> as well as of the Bible,
from that which is in use with us; for from
these Texts above cited, nothing can be infer'd
to prove what he designs, <hi>viz.</hi> that we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
by Christianity to procure more civil
Liberties and Franchises; for it is positively
set down in the Paraphrase, that Christ med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
not with the secular government of this
world, nor changes any man's outward condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by his becoming Christian.</p>
            <p>One would think, by this way of procedure,
Mr. <hi>Johnson,</hi> like <hi>Julian,</hi> onely reades the
Scriptures, to pervert other people by an ill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of them, and to use the Gospel against
his Saviour.</p>
            <p>2. His inference, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was against
Passive Obedience [<hi>Act. 22. 26, &amp;c.</hi>] because
he told the Captain (that was ignorant of his
condition) that he was a <hi>Roman,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
exempt from the punishment he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to inflict upon him, is the most absurd rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
imaginable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40781:12"/>I perceive after all his bawling against Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Obedience, he is perfectly ignorant what it
is; for to suffer torments when we can avert
them by lawfull means, is not Passive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but stupidity: this is not taking up the
Cross (as a great Man observes) but pulling
it down upon us: Christianity allows us to
make a defence, but we are not to resist; we
may certainly tell our story; but if that will
not be heard, we must submit with patience.
And these were the Methods of the Primitive
Christians, they pray'd to God, they supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to their Emperours, to avert a threatn'd
persecution; but if these means would not doe,
they had <hi>Gregory Nazianzen's</hi> comfort left
still, to dye patiently. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Since Passive Obedience is not onely allow'd,
but enjoin'd by the Gospel (as is briefly shown
already, and shall be more fully prov'd by and
by) that it should be contrary to the Law of
the Land (which is the sixth and last thing
he lays down) cannot be admitted, since our
Laws must necessarily conform to the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of the Holy Scriptures; and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is enacted contrary to them, is <hi>ipso facto
void;</hi> and I am sure whatever he says, will
hardly induce any man in his right senses to
think otherwise. I am sure the Case he brings
(<hi>p. 9.</hi>) is nothing to the purpose; for he can
onely infer from that, That a man may kill
<pb facs="tcp:40781:13"/>
an aggressour, and the Law take no hold of
him. If he could prove from any instance
that the Law obliges a man (if he can) to
kill one that offers violence to him, he had said
something: But there is a vast difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
what the Law permits, and what it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
he is not indeed obnoxious to any le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
punishment here, but the verdict of a Iury
will not absolve him from a guilt he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
by disobeying our Saviour, who has
commanded us not to <hi>resist evil, [evil</hi> not sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
a <hi>thing,</hi> but a <hi>person] Mat. 5. 39.</hi>
So that the killing of a <hi>Pursevant,</hi> though it
be excus'd in the eye of the Law, it will not be
so hereafter in heaven; For if he onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
an arrest (as 'tis own'd he did) a man
ought not to take away his life: this is plain
from Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> [Prac. Cat. <hi>p. 164.</hi>]
where he tells us a private man may not by the
Law of Christ take away another's life, to save
his own goods, or to repell any such kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
because life is more than goods; nay,
'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>twould be better to avoid taking away ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
life, though to save his own; thereby
imitating his Saviour who laid down his life
for his enemies. <hi>lbid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to those arguments (<hi>p. 15.</hi>) from Sir <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Ewe's</hi> Iournal to prove the lawfulness and
necessity of excluding a Popish Successour. I
hardly think them worth the least remark. For
what can be more unreasonable, than that
which they seem to enforce, that it had been
<pb facs="tcp:40781:13"/>
just and warrantable not onely to have dis-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited
the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> but to have taken
away her life too, for her Religion?</p>
            <p>For what just pretence could Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
have to Condemn a Princess altogether as
independent as her self, and one that was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accountable to God for her actions? they
might as well have addrest against the <hi>French</hi>
King or the Pope for endeavouring to pervert
her Majestie's Subjects, for the Queen had
equal power over these Princes, though she had
them not in possession: And though an Act of
Parliament against them, would not perhaps
have been of very great force, yet it would
have been expedient to have shewn her good
will (as Mr. <hi>Johnson</hi> calls it.)</p>
            <p>But we shall find the weakness of these argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the effect they bad on the Queen; for
she was so far from being persuaded that the
fact was lawfull, that she always deny'd her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
consenting, or so much as privy to it, when
it was done; and though there might be some
probable reasons to believe she was innocent, yet
the very suspicion of her being privy to it, has
fixt an eternal blot upon her (otherwise unspot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
reputation.</p>
            <p>So that these arguments will seem of very
little weight to his present Majesty, when all
the world knows how unjustly, and unsuccess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
too, they were urg'd against his great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestour,
to a Princess that was her mortal ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and one but too desirous of her destruction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40781:14"/>There is nothing now left in the Preface that
is worth taking notice of, but the Act of the <hi>13</hi>
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whereby 'twas enacted
Treason during her life, to affirm that she, and
her Parliament, could not make Laws and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
of sufficient force and validity, to limit
and bind the Crown of this Realm, and the
Descent, Limitation, Inheritance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I shall
not presume to determine of the equity and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of this Act, or whether it were in their
power to doe as they did; but the Excellent
Authour of a late Pamphlet, entituled, <hi>The
Great point of Succession discussed,</hi> being an
Answer to the <hi>History of Succession,</hi> &amp;c.
though he was a Member of those very Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that were so hot for the Bill of Exclusion,
freely declares that the Crown of <hi>England</hi> is,
and ought to be, inseparably annext to proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of blood, by the Laws of God, and Nature,
and this Realm; so that consequently any Act,
that pretends to alter the Succession, is utterly
unlawfull, and <hi>ipso facto</hi> void: and so it
ought to be adjudged when it ever comes to the
Question before the Reverend Iudges, <hi>p. 35.</hi>
If any one requires fuller satisfaction, I refer
him to the Book it self, which will convince
not onely the diffiders, but the prejudic'd too,
of the truth of what is here deliver'd.</p>
            <p>As for the great Subscribers to that Act, we
have a <hi>Hierarchy</hi> not at all inferiour to them,
either in piety or learning, who are of the
contrary opinion; and till I know the reasons
<pb facs="tcp:40781:14"/>
why they subscrib'd, I shall not be sway'd by
their Authorities, when I think I have as
great to ballance them.</p>
            <p>'Twill be time now to give some account of
the ensuing Work, but any considering man
will reade the design in the Title Page, or at
least will find it in the Book it self, from which
I shall no longer detain him.</p>

               <hi>CONSTANTINE</hi> the Great having
by his last Will divided his Empire
between his three Sons, <hi>Constantine,
Constantius, Constance,</hi> died in the Suburbs
of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> no one of his Sons being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at his death: But <hi>Constantius,</hi> not so
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40781:16"/>
far off as the other two, first came to Court;
where having paid the usual respects that
are due to the memory of a deceased Parent,
as if all other tyes of Nature were buried
with his Father, he commanded, or at least
permitted, the execution of his Uncle and
Cousins, <hi>Constantius Dalmatius</hi> and his Sons.
[<hi>Atha.</hi> p. 856.] About three months after
the Brothers were proclaim'd Emperours by
the Army, each took his share, though not
without some dissatisfaction and disturbance;
but things being happily compos'd for the
present, they retir'd to their respective Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</p>
            <p>This agreement did not last long, for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
thought himself hardly dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
and not content with his share of
<hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ance, Spain</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> would needs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach
upon his Brother <hi>Constance,</hi> who had
<hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> but was slain in the prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution:
Thus the Empire of the West de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd
to <hi>Constance,</hi> but all this new accessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
could not prevent his being assasinated
by <hi>Magnentius</hi> an Usurping Rebel: who at
length after many defeats by <hi>Constantius,</hi> was
forced to that degree of despair, that he slew
himself, and left his Conquerour in the quiet
possession of all the Empire.</p>
            <p>I was unwilling to perplex this brief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his coming to the entire possession
of the Empire, with the relation of any of
his particular actions, reserving it rather
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40781:16"/>
to this place where I may doe it with less
interruption.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Constantius</hi> had not been long upon the
Throne, but by the insinuations of an <hi>Arian</hi>
Priest, he was brought over to be a great
favourer of that Heresie; the account of his
perversion, is at large in most Ecclesiastical
Histories; and because it may be material, I
shall give it at length out of <hi>Theodoret</hi> [<hi>l.</hi> 2.
<hi>c.</hi> 3.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Constantia,</hi> Sister to <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great,
was very intimate with an <hi>Arian</hi> Priest, who,
dissembling his own opinion, made it his
business to defend or excuse <hi>Arius;</hi> this
man, upon her death-bed, she recommended
to her Brother's care, who was signally kind
to him; and as a particular mark of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
entrusted his last Testament in his
hands: the delivery of which to <hi>Constantius,</hi>
when he came to Court, was sufficient to
recommend him to his favour; and gave
him an interest, that in a short time became
pernicious to the whole Christian World;
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or he improving the opportunity he had
of being nigh the Emperour, and making his
advantage of an inconstant humour that was
peculiar to him, easily made him out of love
with the true Religion, and as zealous for the
false. He perswaded the Emperour, who
was but too prone to hearken to any thing
that was ill, (<hi>Ath.</hi> p. 883.) that all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances
in the Church arose from intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40781:17"/>
the word <hi>Consubstantial</hi> into the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Faith, which was no-where to be
found in Holy Scripture, and the blame of
this was laid upon <hi>Athanasius.</hi> Thus was
that unhappy Emperour perverted to a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,
the most dangerous that ever infested
the Church, for <hi>Athanasius</hi> tells us (who had
certainly good reason to know) they deny'd
Christ. [<hi>p.</hi> 590.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Athanasius</hi> was the first man that suffer'd
by the Emperour's Apostacy; for his piety
and learning rendring him formidable to
those Hereticks, they soon traduced him to
<hi>Constantius,</hi> who sent part of his Army to
seize him at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> but by a miraculous
escape, he prevented the danger and fled to
<hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Georgius</hi> an <hi>Arian</hi> succeeded him in his
Diocess, who repeated all the Cruelties of
the former Persecutions, which were ten
times worse in him, than in the Heathens,
since he at least profest Christianity; he
whipt the Men with rods, stript the Virgins
naked, and brought them to the fire, [<hi>Nicep.
Cal. Eccl. Hist.</hi>] and in fine, acted all those
torments a busie malice could invent, or a
blind fierce zeal could execute.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Alexandria</hi> was not the onely Scene
of Persecution; it spread it self in a short
time as far as the Heresie that was the cause
of it; but it raged particularly in <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople:</hi>
for <hi>Macedonius</hi> despising the known
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40781:17"/>
methods of cruelty as too mean for an <hi>Arian</hi>
to exercise, had recourse to those that were
particularly of his own invention; he did
not onely punish those that would not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with him, with the ordinary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
of Whips, Chains, Death: but by
an unpresidented cruelty, would force open
their mouths with Clubs, and then throw
into them the sacred Elements.</p>
            <p>Women likewise and Children, though
not initiated nor baptiz'd, were preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
forced to be partakers of the Holy
Sacrament, and were made, as far as it lay in
his power, Hereticks before they knew what
Religion was. [<hi>Nic. Call. ib.</hi>] This certainly
was a far greater wickedness than that of
<hi>Iulian;</hi> when by adding the Images of the
Heathen gods to his own, he design'd to
deceive the Christians into Idolatry; for this
was down-right forcing them (if it were
possible) into Heresie.</p>
            <p>Upon these unheard-of methods of Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
and other bodily torments no less
strange, that are at large set down in that
History, the Authour makes this severe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark:
<hi>Insolitum sane id, exoticumque suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium,
ab iis, qui Christum professi sunt, inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;

               <hi>Liberius, Hosius, Paulinus, Dionysius, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius,

to subscribe against <hi>Athanasius,</hi> who had
been acquitted by so many Synods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
<hi>Ib.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Constantius</hi> himself at length pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to that degree of cruelty against the
Orthodox Christians, that he made an Edict,
not onely to banish them, but to put them
to death. <hi>Athan.</hi> p. 8. 53.</p>
            <p>And the same Father tells us, that when
<hi>Maximianus (Constantine's</hi> Father) persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Christians, the Heathens themselves
would conceal them, and were so generous
often as to suffer fines and imprisonment,
rather than betray those that fled to them
for Protection: but the New Hereticks act
just the contrary, they voluntarily take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them the office of Searchers, and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners,
and think that he that hides a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
is as much their enemy as he that's hid.</p>
            <p>And then speaking of <hi>Constantius,</hi> he says
(<hi>Atha.</hi> p. 8. 36.) <hi>Maximianus</hi> sent the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours
into one common place of Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
so that in all their mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fortunes, they
had one comfort left (and that no small
one) of mutual society. But <hi>Constantius</hi>
industri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="5 letters">

               </gap>

               </gap>rted those that were friends,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40781:18"/>
that he might make the misery of their ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
more insupportable, and prevent
the onely happiness they desir'd, not to be
parted till they died. This was so great a
Cruelty, that never can be excus'd, and no
body but a Primitive Christian could bear
it without repining.</p>
            <p>It would be an endless piece of business
to recount all the sufferings of the Church,
under this cruel Apostate, who was no less a
Tyrant in Civil affairs, than a Persecutour in
Religious; it being an observ'd Maxim, that
under him no one had escap'd Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of whom it had been but whisper'd
that he was guilty; for he seldom heard
above one side, <hi>viz.</hi> the whispering <hi>Arian</hi>
or Eunuch, and 'twas counted as insolent
for any one accus'd to pretend to make a
defence as to protest against <hi>Arianism. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian.</hi>
in 21 tells us, <hi>Si affectatae dominationis

            </p>
            <p>So that if a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour can act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Law (as Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> affirms),
certainly <hi>Constantius</hi> did: For what can be
more evident, than that no man should be
condemn'd without being first heard, or his
Accuser appearing, was an Establisht Law of
the Empire? But yet that he acted quite
contrary to this, we may plainly see in <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius:</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:40781:19"/>
For how many were drag'd to death,
without daring to offer at a defence? Which
would have been so far from excusing them,
that it would onely have rendred them more
guilty in the eye of the Judge; who being
always resolv'd to condemn, must needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt
any thing ill, that look't as if it design'd
to prevent him.</p>
            <p>And if putting People to death upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
and shamms was the particular mark
(as Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> delivers) of an Arbitrary
lawless Tyrant, certainly <hi>Constantius</hi> put in
as fair for the Title as any one; For what
could be more so, than the Actions of his
Deputies in <hi>AEgypt</hi> by his Commission?
Where innocent children, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oolish old
women were executed; these for prescribing,
those for wearing an insignificant charm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
an Ague, under the pretence that they
dealt in Sorcery. The first time certainly
that people ever died for being fools, or
that old women suffer'd for superstition,

            <p>Neither were the Emperour's actions at
home less unaccountable; for when his Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophants
had once persuaded him, that the
safety of the World did so much depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his, that it must cease to be with him,
(wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all that came nigh him to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs

was death; discontent at any thing was
mis-interpreted disaffection to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and a man must not be angry, for fear
it should be thought he was displeas'd at the

            <p>If these provocations could not urge the

         <div n="2" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. II. The Sense of the Primitive Christians
about his Succession.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>COnstantius</hi> came to the Crown with the
profession of that Religion his Father
was so eminent a defender of; so that the
Christians under <hi>Constantine</hi> (without the
gift of Prophecy) could not well expect his
Apostacy. But I am induced to believe,
that if they had, there would have been no
Petitions to the Emperour to exclude his
Son, to secure their Religion; but rather
assurances from them, that this was not a just
way to preserve it; there would have been
no Bill from the Senate with a Contradiction
in the belly of it, to tell the Emperour they
would by no means attempt the violation of
his Prerogative, or the alteration of the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Laws of the Empire; and yet in
the very next clause, offer at the Exclusion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40781:20"/>
of his lawfull Heir; the nature of the thing
will not allow me to make any proof from
History that it was so, but I don't question
to make it more than probable it would have
been so, if there had been occasion.</p>
            <p>For since the Right of the next Heir to
the Crown is so strongly secur'd by the
Laws of God and Nature, (as I hope has
been sufficiently prov'd in the Preface) and
that it is plain <hi>Constantius</hi> had this right, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
descended from <hi>Constantine;</hi> I can't ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that the fears of the Christians (though
they had the assurance of <hi>Constantius</hi> being
an <hi>Arian</hi>) could authorize them to attempt
his Exclusion; for besides that it is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
to the Principles of their Religion,
to prevent a future inconvenience, by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
ill, (as is shown before) if we may
conclude what they would have done then,
from what their forefathers did before, or
they themselves afterwards, we shall find
that they thought no reason great enough
to put by the lawfull Heir.</p>
            <p>For when a Heathen was to succeed, there
was not the least attempt to bar him; not
onely because they doubted their strength,
and therefore thought their endeavours
would be in vain, but because they thought
the contrary their duty; for they did not
onely not make it their business to prevent
his coming to the Empire, but as much as in
them lay assisted it; for as 'tis above cited
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40781:21"/>
from <hi>Athenagoras,</hi> they declar'd they thought
it most just that <hi>Commodus,</hi> as rightfull Heir,
should succeed his Father <hi>M. Aurelius;</hi> nay
'twas their constant prayer to Almighty God
that he might: which certainly had been
the greatest madness in the world (he being
a Heathen, and consequently their mortal
enemy) if they had not thought it so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
a duty incumbent upon them, that
no consideration of their future quiet, or the
unmolested enjoyment of their Religion,
could exempt them from. So that if the
Actions of these Christians have any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
with us, if we have not disclaim'd their
very principles as well as piety, we shall not
think it so strange, as Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> would
have the world believe we do, for Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
not to oppose the Succession of their
lawfull Prince, though part of his Religion
be to extirpate theirs. If it were our own
case, we might lawfully pray for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
and I don't question but we should
doe it very heartily, for the free exercise of
our Religion is the greatest happiness we can
wish for on this side heaven; but if we could
have it but for an evil thought, 'twere much
too dear, and not to be purchased at that
rate: And therefore I have often look't with
horrour upon that unchristian prayer of the
Protestants under Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> which was
certainly (whatever Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> declares to
the contrary) never heard or read, to have
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40781:21"/>
been us'd by any good Christian man against
any Prince, though he were a Pagan or Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,
<hi>&amp;c. [Pream.</hi> to the Act] (as shall be
seen at large when I come to treat of the
Christians prayers) and it was deservedly
made Treason then, for it was so long before
in the eye of heaven; for if an evil thought
or wish against our neighbour, is made as
much murther, by the Gospel, as actually
striking him to the heart, why such a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
profession of our hatred to our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
and desire of her destruction (upon
what consideration soever) should not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr
a proportionable guilt, I cannot easily
imagine.</p>
            <p>But to come nigher to the case in hand,
'twill be evident to any, never so little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
in the Ecclesiastical Writers, that
most of those very people, that Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi>
represents to the world for such fierce Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluders
of a Prince, that profest a contrary
Religion to theirs, did not think (or at least
did not act as if they thought) that a Prince
could be barr'd of his Right of Succession,
upon the score of Religion; for not two
years after <hi>Iulian's</hi> death, <hi>Valens</hi> a furious
<hi>Arian,</hi> and bitter persecutour of those that
dissented from him, was peacefully admitted
to be Emperour, and assisted too by the
Army; whom we can't think in the least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to favour that Heresie (for they were
<hi>Iovinian's</hi> Souldiers) but they knew their
duty to their Prince.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:40781:22"/>I hope these plain instances will satisfie
any reasonable man, that the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
did not think it consistent with the
Principles of their Religion, to exclude a
lawfull Successour upon any terms, since
we see that neither being a Heathen or an
<hi>Arian</hi> (two the most dangerous enemies to
Christianity) could prevail with them to
attempt it.</p>
            <p>'Twould be easie here to answer all the
pretended Arguments and Authorities Mr.
<hi>Iohnson</hi> brings, to prove the contrary actions
of the Primitive Christians toward <hi>Iulian:</hi>
but I suppose the Reader remembers what
has been already said of them particularly in
the Preface; so that I shall not need to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
him, or my self, with a repetition.</p>
            <p>But I shall hasten to give an Account of
their Behaviour toward <hi>Constantius,</hi> and leave
the world to judge whether it be not more
agreeable to the Gospel, than that which
Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> falsely scandalizes the Christians,
under <hi>Iulian,</hi> with; and consequently fittest
for our imitation.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. Their Behaviour towards Him in
Words.</head>
            <p>'TIS a strange account Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> gives
us of the Christians behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their Emperour, though a Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
and an Apostate; for railing is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
so far from being Evangelical, that it
is contrary to the Principles of common
breeding. But perhaps these were some of
those unhappy people the Emperour had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted
the benefit of going to School to,
and now he deservedly found the effect of
his cruelty. But then he ought to have
told us so, and not to have laid it down in
such general terms, as if it were the approv'd
practice of the whole Church: This is the
strangest injustice to that famous age imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
and onely exposing those examples,
one would think, by the end of his book,
he designs we should imitate; for from the
scope of his Book, I can conclude nothing
but this, <hi>viz.</hi> That he intends to give us an
account how the Christians in former ages
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40781:23"/>
behav'd themselves toward an Apostate, to
inform us what we may doe on the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.
I must confess he has done most of
his own party a considerable kindness; for
they hitherto have rail'd without president,
as well as without cause: And I suppose
<hi>Greek</hi> e'er long will be much in fashion with
them, as a Language that will extremely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
them for that Christian liberty.
But as for us, we shall rather fetch the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of our Conduct from the graver Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the Fathers of those times; and not
imitate him, who, like our late travelling
Sparks, onely observes, and treasures up the
vices and follies of the places he visits, and
exposes them, when he comes home, for ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
and accomplishments.</p>
            <p>None certainly but the scum and rabble
of that age could be guilty of those indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to their Emperour: but Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi>
tells us, no less a man than <hi>Theodoret</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
them for their Nick-names and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
and quotes his 3<hi>d</hi> Book and <hi>c.</hi> 22.
for what he says; I have look't with both
eyes, and cannot find any thing like it: He
commends indeed the <hi>Antiochians</hi> for their
Zeal, but not their rudeness.</p>
            <p>As to the Example of <hi>Maris,</hi> which he
brings as the second and last argument to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
ill language given to an Emperour, if
an Apostate, is of very little force; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all doubt, it was an indiscreet Action,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40781:23"/>
and nothing but his great Zeal for Religion
could make any colourable excuse for it;
For who, unless he had a mind to be a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,
would affront an Emperour in the height
of his devotion, and upbraid his gods when
he was paying his adorations to them? <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi>
I am sure would have counted such an
Action down-right madness; for he tells us,
when we doe nothing contrary to the law
and word of God, we are not so mad or fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
as to stir up, against our selves, the
wrath of the King or of the Magistrate,
which would bring upon us
blows,<note place="margin">Orig. l. 8. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Cel.</note> torments, and divers
kinds of death.</p>
            <p>And I have some reason to assert this,
from the quite different Conduct of all the
Fathers that liv'd under <hi>Constantius;</hi> that
were so far from doing any thing of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
unprovok't, that all the Cruelties that
Apostate Emperour could inflict, did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
the least mis-becoming expression from
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Athanasius</hi> tells the Emperour in his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy;
<q>I am not mad, O King, neither
have I forgot the voice of
God that saith,<note place="margin">Atha. Apol. ad Const.</note> 
                  <hi>Curse not the
King,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ath. ibid.</note>

And again,
<q>I did not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Command of your Majesty, God
forbid. I am not such a man as would
oppose the very Treasurer of the City,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40781:24"/>
much less so great an Emperour; I was
not so mad as to contradict such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
as yours; I neither did oppose the
Command of your Majesty, nor will now
attempt to enter into <hi>Alexandria,</hi> untill
you, of your Goodness, will please, I
shall.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And in another place of the same Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
he tells <hi>Constantius,</hi>
               <q>If I had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd
before others, I had appeal'd unto
your Majesty, as the Apostle appeal'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

the boldness to calumniate me <hi>before Thee,</hi>
to whom shall I appeal <hi>from Thee,</hi> but to

that he may incline thy heart to mercy?</q>

            <p>St. <hi>Hilary</hi> tells him (and in the time

so much as dis-respectfully of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour:
but tells him,
<q>Since he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd

whosoever did detract any thing from that,
should be look't upon as an opposer of

            <p>It would be easie to seem very learned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this point, that is, to stuff my Margin
with quotations; but that's a vanity I am
not over-desirous to be thought guilty of.
I hope the authorities I have already cited,
will be sufficient to prove what I design'd,
<hi>viz.</hi> That it was the judgment of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Christians, that no ill usage from their
Emperour, though a Heathen or Apostate,
could authorize them to affront him; and
that difference of Religion, doth not, by any
means, cancell our Obedience to him.</p>
            <p>Now that the face of things should be so
soon chang'd, as that it should be damnation
to speak ill of the Emperour under <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius;</hi>
and under <hi>Iulian,</hi> his immediate Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour,
not onely permitted, but merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40781:25"/>
to curse him (as Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> acquaints
us) is very strange.</p>
            <p>I am confident if they did those Actions
he lays to their charge, they had no president
for them in former ages; and the doctrine
they govern'd themselves by, was perfectly
new and their own: For 'tis well known all
the first Christians acted quite contrary;
they continually night and day pray'd for
the safety of the Emperour, [<hi>Cypr. ad De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</hi>]</p>
            <p>It would be easie out of the Martyrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
of the first times, to give instances of
the Christians submission, as strange, as the
cruelty of their Persecutours: But this will
be unnecessary, since their sufferings and
patience are so well known, that Mr. <hi>Iohn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
himself is forc't to own it; but tells us
withall, 'twas their duty to suffer patiently,
because they were persecuted according to
law. This answer is of very little force, for
there was no other law but the will of their
Emperours against them, or their Edicts,
which were onely their will manifested;
both which were as much Laws in <hi>Iulian's</hi>
time, as <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ro's:</hi> Therefore why the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
should think it their duty patiently to
submit to all the inhumane cruelties of that
first Persecutour, and those under <hi>Iulian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,
or at least murmur at those lighter pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of their Emperour, I am not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:40781:25"/>I am inclin'd to think, that Mr. <hi>Iohnson's</hi>
Christians were not so good as they should
be; for those that will onely submit quietly
to Persecution upon some conditions (for he
tells u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, though they resisted <hi>Iulian,</hi> they
would patiently have bore the cruelty of a
Heathen persecutour) are govern'd rather
by humour than Religion; for the Gospel I
am sure makes no distinction, and 'tis a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
maxim, <hi>Ubi lex non distinguit nemo
distinguere debet;</hi> Where the Law makes no
distinction, no man ought to doe it.</p>
            <p>But besides, it has been sufficiently prov'd,
that <hi>Constantius's</hi> proceedings were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as illegal and arbitrary, as those of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
could possibly be; they were both Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
and though indeed the latter was less
to be excus'd (it being something a worse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to <hi>Paganism</hi> than <hi>Arianism</hi>) yet in
respect of the quiet and security of the
Church, they were both equally dangerous.
And yet we see from the Examples of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Bishops, the prayers of all the people, that
they were so far from cursing him or giving
him to the Devil for his due, that they seem
to be fond of his life, and make the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and welfare of the Empire, to be the
first business of their prayers. For hence it is
that we give respect to a Heathen, if put in
Authority; for though he be most unworthy
of it himself, who holding God's place, gives
the Devil thanks for it; but the honour we
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40781:26"/>
give him, his place challengeth. [<hi>Q.</hi> 35. <hi>exerc.

Christians would by any means allow of these
Actions.</p>
            <p>As to the first, that of <hi>Valentinian,</hi> I must
needs own 'twas far more excusable than
what old <hi>Gregory</hi> did, for his Character, and
the meanness of the person that suffer'd by
him, may plead something in his behalf, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in a Souldier being more pardonable than
in a Bishop, and bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing a Priest, more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
than kicking an Emperour; but this
will not justifie the violence, for it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
a fault, though the praises the
Historian gives it, would seem to prove the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40781:26"/>
contrary. For to this I answer, That the
Action deserv'd to be prais'd, not for its own
sake, but because it shew'd an extraordinary
Zeal for Christianity; it was the Motive,
and not the Fact, that was to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
and that this is not purely a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>,
but the real truth of the matter, we may i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
from this plain instance. In the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church many kill'd themselves, when
they could by no other means avoid sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing
to Idols; and they stand now upon
Record for Martyrs. This Action of theirs
was certainly self-mur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her, and consequently
criminal; and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rms, that it
was a fault in them too; but the love of
God, and the fear they should be polluted
by Idols, was the cause of it. And so though
it might as a frailty be pardon'd by God's
mercy in Christ, yet sure this killing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
was not that which made them Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs;
but that great love of God, and resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
against Idolatrous worship, which testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
it self in their killing themselves for that
Cause: This it was that made them pass for
Martyrs, and that other incident fault of
theirs, was not, in that case, thought so great,
as to divest them or rob them of that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
[Dr. <hi>Ham. Pr. C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> highly
probable that this was <hi>Valentinian's</hi> Case;
'twas not his striking the Priest, but his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
that gave him a title to two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
that of the Empire and Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:40781:27"/>But I need not have said so much of this,
for Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> himself allows it to be an
unaccountable Action, <hi>p.</hi> 44.</p>
            <p>As to the extravagant Action of old <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory
Nazianzen</hi> (for I can't justly give it a
milder Epithet) certainly nothing but the
partiality of a Son can excuse it, and 'tis a
fault even in him to commend it; <hi>for who
can stretch forth his hand against the Lord's
anointed</hi> (sure the Foot is not excepted)
<hi>and be guiltless</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. 9.) St. <hi>Chrysostom's</hi>
forbidding the Empress <hi>Eudoxia</hi> to come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Church, was not half so insolent as
this Act of <hi>Gregory's,</hi> yet he severely repented
of it, and tells us, in the cooler hours of his
life, he did more than he could justifie.</p>
            <p>If I were to specifie the particular Actions of
the Primitive Christians under <hi>Constantius,</hi> in
opposition to those under <hi>Iulian,</hi> I should be
as prolix and tedious as Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> is in his
comparison of Popery and Paganism; I shall
add in general terms, (and I defie any one to
disprove me out of the Writings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
the Histories, and the Martyrologies
of that age) that the Souldiers, (though of
a contrary opinion) fought for him. The
Fathers (though banish'd) pray'd for him,
as likewise did the Martyrs under persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

            <p>I Don't think there is so much difference

            <p>I must confess there seems some weight in

            <p>And what is more, he tells them in the

to dye for the Truth, but even to dye
praying for the Persecutour, was one of
the great requisits to obtain so glorious a

            <p>But perhaps Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> will tell us this
is but one Doctor's opinion; but if he will

            <p>
               <hi>Cyprian</hi> speaking to the Emperour, says,

               </gap>igher home, <hi>Athanasius</hi> (a
man not over tame but when it was his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
gives this reason for celebrating pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> before it
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40781:29"/>
was dedicated, that the people earnestly
prest him, that they might all pray for the
safety of the Emperour in the Church,
which he himself had builded; being ready
otherwise to go out of the City, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
themselves in the desarts, at the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
of <hi>Easter,</hi> which at that time was to
be celebrated.</p>
            <p>And again, speaking to the Emperour,
[You do not forbid, but are willing that all
men should pray, knowing that this is the
prayer of all, that you may live in safety,
and continually reign in peace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>—And
again (O Emperour of God most belov'd)
many circuits of years, I pray, may you live,
and accomplish the dedication of this
Church; for those prayers that are made
within for your welfare, don't at all hinder
the dedication of the Church.]</p>
            <p>This will be enough to satisfie any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
man, that Cursing an Emperour is
not so Catholick a Doctrine as Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi>
would have us to believe, and that all the
Fathers were not of old <hi>Gregory's</hi> mind.
I am inclin'd to believe, that if he could
have found but one instance more of such
a fiery Zeal, it had certainly appear'd, and
been improv'd to the best advantage: For
we find by his transcribing so great a part
of the Book of Homilies, he is of a good
Communicative nature, and keeps nothing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40781:29"/>
to himself that may prove in the least bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
to the publick.</p>
            <p>But I believe it will be a hard thing to find
the least pretence for this Doctrine, in all the
Orthodox Writings in former ages; and any
of the Fathers would look upon the broacher
of such principles with as much detestation,
and call him as many names as <hi>Gregory</hi> did
<hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude this Chapter, it will
not be impertinent to shew, that prayers
and tears were not so much out of fashion
in the Primitive Church, as to be redicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in ours; as for their prayers, that they
were not aim'd against the Emperour, I hope
has been sufficiently shew'd already, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d for his safety. And though it
may seem <hi>unmanly,</hi> yet that it was not <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian</hi>
to weep, St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> will inform
us; who speaking to his Flock at <hi>Milane,</hi>
tells them, [Willingly I will never forsake
you; being constrain'd, I know not how to
make opposition; I can sorrow, I can weep,
I can sigh, against Armour, Souldiers and
Goths: Tears are my weapons, for such is
the Armour of a Priest, otherways I cannot,
dare not, resist.] <hi>Amb. in Ora. de Bas. non

            </p>
            <p>And this same Father (who had likewise
to deal with an <hi>Arian</hi> Emperour, <hi>Valentinian</hi>
the younger) did not defend himself with his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40781:30"/>
hand or his weapon, but by fastings, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
watchings, and continuing under the
Altars, by his <hi>prayers</hi> he procur'd God to be
a defender both of him and his Church.
<hi>Ruf. Ec. H. l.</hi> 2. c. 26.</p>
            <p>And that Prayers and Tears do very well
together, St. <hi>Bernard</hi> tells us, writing to <hi>

(a great while for a <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

News of <hi>Iulian's</hi> being proclaim'd
Emperour by the Army: 'Tis not to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
but he resented this treacherous Action
with the highest indignation; but we do
not hear that he attempted to exclude him

out his Edicts to take away the title of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
from <hi>Iulian</hi> (which was equivalent to
that of H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

shewing his design to dis-inherit him; but
leaving the prosecution of that War he had

<hi>Iulian,</hi> to be reveng'd of that ungratefull
Usurper, and to secure himself in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;
for he might kill <hi>Iulian</hi> as a Rebell,

he could not dis-inherit him as such, because
God, though he gave the power of life and

the disposing of Kingdoms to himself. But
to proceed in the Narrative: <hi>Constantius,</hi>

he died of a very high Fever; for <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellinus</hi>

his Death to an Apoplexy. I shall
leave the reconciliation of these two Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
to those that think themselves concern'd
in it; for it is not material here of what
death he died: but it is certain the News of
it was miraculously convey'd to <hi>Iulian;</hi> for
after he had consulted his Gods and Priests
about the event of things, and they had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
him of success above his hopes, yet he
was dissatisfied still; he look't upon what
they said to be rather slattery than prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40781:31"/>
and thought their predictions rather
squar'd to his desires, than truth; but he
was quickly satisfied by an extraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation;
for at the very same time the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour

            <head>CHAP. VII. How they us'd his Memory.</head>
            <p>THE Primitive Christians were so far
from offering any injury to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of <hi>Constantius,</hi> that as if they had
onely remembred he was their Emperour;
and now by his being dead, own'd a new ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
superadded to <hi>that,</hi> to speak well of
Him; they deplore his loss with all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
of a real sorrow: the eyes that
were wet when he persecuted them, wept
afresh at his funeral, as if they had perfectly
learn't that great lesson of their Saviour, not
onely to bear with, but even to love their
enemies. The Souldiers you would think,
by the extravagance of their grief, had forgot
their Character; and <hi>Constantine</hi> himself
died not more lamented than his Son. <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
who had no great reason to be fond
of his life, if he consulted his own safety,
assisted at his Obsequies, and made a very
considerable figure in that sorrowfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession;
and if we reade <hi>Gregory Nizian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen's</hi>
description of his funeral, we must needs
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40781:33"/>
stand amaz'd at the greatness of their Charity;
He tells us, that he was carried forth with all
the solemnity the Christians us'd to honour
the Corps of a Pious Hero with; and would
fain persuade the people to believe that the
very Angels themselves, in reward of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual
piety, contributed their assistance to
inhance the Glories of his Funeral; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this is one of that Father's flights, or really
true, I shan't contend: this is certain from
all the Histories of that age, that he died ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
lamented; and that those that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
by his Edicts, did not presume to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
the Memory of him that made them.</p>
            <p>This was the Conduct of the Primitive
Christian; and if they ever acted contrary,
it was not to be imputed to their Religion,
but their Passions. I shall easily grant that
there are some severe reflexions upon <hi>Iulian</hi>
to be met withall in Authours of very good
note; but I hope Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> will not infer
from that, that they are warrantable. If he
reades those very Fathers thorough, he will
find that their Theory runs sometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their Practice, and that they don't
always act according to their own principles;
and I don't know why he should draw those
passages into presidents for us, which the
Authours themselves in their cooler minutes
were asham'd to own.</p>

Christians, wherein, of Passive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</head>
            <p>THat the Persecution under <hi>Constantius</hi>
was much severer than any of the ten
former, is evident to any one that considers
the Cruel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies that were daily acted by the
<hi>Arian</hi> Hereticks; who as they were much
more zealous for their Opinions than the
Heathens, so consequently they were more
eager in prosecuting those that dissented from
them: The loss of a Trade or Profession was
not the punishment of their Non-conformity,
but of Life too; nay, there were penalties
inflicted where death was the least part of
the punishment: But all these heavy grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
did not make them question God's
Providence, or remonstrate to the Decrees
of the Emperour; they did not make their
pressures just, by impatiently submitting to
them; nor frustrate the reward of their suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
by reviling their Persecutours; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40781:34"/>
by rendring their Persecution onely an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
affliction: they look't upon their
miseries as necessary tryals of their faith,
knowing that the power of even wicked
and hurtfull Kings is from God.</p>
            <p>What therefore can justifie the Primitive
Christians carriage toward <hi>Iulian,</hi> if it were
according to the account Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> gives
of it, <hi>p.</hi> 66? That they vext every vein in
his Royal heart; said all their prayers back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
and call'd down for vengeance upon
his head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And at last concludes, They
seem to have broke all the measures by which
all the ancient and suffering Christians have
gone by in their Per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ecutions, <hi>p.</hi> 68. The
reasons he brings to justifie their Actions, are
these:</p>
            <p>1. That their case was different from that
of the first Christians, because Christianity
was now the Establisht Religion of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
and they were justly incensed at <hi>Iulian</hi>
in offering to disturb them in the exercise
of it.</p>
            <p>2. Since <hi>Constantius</hi> had repeal'd all the
sanguinary Edicts against them, they were
persecuted contrary to Law.</p>
            <p>To the first of these I answer; That if
he takes Christianity for the true Religion
<hi>Constantine</hi> profess'd and maintain'd, his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
is utterly false; for the Emperour's
Religion, which is likewise the Religion of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40781:34"/>
the Empire, as far as Edicts can make it, (and
<hi>Constantine</hi> had no other way to establish
any thing) was <hi>Arianism;</hi> for <hi>Constantius</hi>
had long maintain'd that damnable Heresie,
and had supply'd all the places of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Bishops, who were banish'd for their
Confession with the most violent professours
of it. So that when <hi>Iulian</hi> came to the
Empire, the Church was far from enjoying
that peace and tranquillity Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes,
<hi>p.</hi> 68. for it was miserably rent with
divisions, and hardly visible but in a few
persecuted, distressed members: For grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>Constantius</hi> did at last repent, it was
so late first, he had no time to settle the true
Religion, but left the Empire infected with
the Heresie he first introduced: which was
no more Christianity then, than <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi>
is now; for though they acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Saviour, 'twas one of their own making,
and the Notions they entertain'd of Christ
may perhaps onely entitle them to greater
damnation, than the Heathens that never
heard his name: So that the quiet enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Religion could not make them
so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ierce against <hi>Iulian,</hi> for designing to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
them, for he could not put them into a
greater confusion than they were in already:
Nay, they rather found the contrary; for
whoever will take the pains to compare <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian's</hi>
Usage of the Christians with that of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40781:35"/>
               <hi>Constantius,</hi> he will find that the Heathen
was less a Persecutour than the <hi>Arian;</hi> and
that the Church had more quiet minutes in
the short Reign of <hi>Iulian,</hi> than in 30 years
before; for he (upon what private designs
matters not) call'd home the Banish'd Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stor'd them to their places in
the Church: And though he ridicul'd Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
he did not often persecute the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours
of it; he endeavour'd indeed to gain
Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lytes, but yet, like <hi>Arians,</hi> he did not
compell people to his Altars: Nay if we
will take Mr. <hi>Iohnson's</hi> word, he was rather
a Tempter than a Persecutour. I hope this
is enough to shew, that there is not a word
true of all that gay description Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi>
gives u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>p.</hi> 68, 69, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the flourishing
condition of the Church; and consequently
the just sense of the happiness they enjoy'd,
and a fear to be rob'd of it, could not ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
the Christians to that degree that he
tells us it did.</p>
            <p>2. As to the second, That <hi>Constantine</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd
all the sanguinary Edicts against the
Christians, and therefore if they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted,
'twas contrary to Law; it is a very
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hallow inference: For though that first
Christian Emperour repeal'd all the sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Edicts, yet his Successour was not in
the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ast ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d up: One single word of his
would put them all in force again. Nay if
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40781:35"/>
we believe <hi>Iustinian</hi> (who certainly was a
good judge in the case) the Emperour could
not act contrary to Law; for what he did,
was according to his pleasure, and his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
was a Law, <hi>Quod Principi placuit legis
habet vigorem,</hi> [Just. <hi>Inst.</hi> l. 1. c. 2.] and the
Edicts were altogether as Arbitrary, for they
were onely the Emperour's will more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
made known; for <hi>Theop.</hi> defines them,
<hi>Edicta sunt, cum Princeps motu proprio, <gap reason="foreign">

aliquid constituit ad ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestatem
&amp; utilitatem reipublicae;</hi> for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Emperour enacted, how ill soever,
was suppos'd to be so; for as his sentence
was always presum'd to be just [<hi>Principis
sententia praesumitur semper justa unde ab ea
non appellatur;</hi>] so likewise were all his
actions: So that whether <hi>Iulian</hi> put the
Christians to death upon sanguinary Edicts,
or rather accus'd them of other Crimes (that
he might avoid the invidious name of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutour)
and so destroy'd them, is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial,
for '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is certain he commanded them
to be executed; and if he did, they dy'd
lawfully, for his Command was a Law; and
that the Emperour's Command had this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
is evident from the Protestation of
the people of <hi>Alexandria, Athan.</hi> p. 858.
[If it be the Emperour's Command we should
be persecuted, we are all ready to suffer
Martyrdom; but if there be no such thing,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40781:36"/>
we beseech <hi>Maximus,</hi> the Governour of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
and all the Magistrates, that they would
entreat his Majesty that no such thing may
be attempted against us.] So that what Mr.
<hi>Iohnson</hi> means, <hi>p.</hi> 72. by saying the first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
suffer'd according to the Laws of their
Country, whereas those under <hi>Iulian</hi> were
persecuted contrary to Law, is hard to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine;
for every one knows the will of
their Emperours was the Law of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
for they were as Arbitrary then as he
that now Usurps their Throne; and I hope
no body will say the great <hi>Turk</hi> persecutes
his Subjects contrary to Law, when he kills
5 or 6000 of them for diversion: That he
acts unjustly, I grant, but the Laws (that is,
his will and pleasure) are on his side.</p>
            <p>But to put an end to this matter, 'twill be
evident to any that have read the former
part of this Book, that all the sanguinary
Acts against Christians were not repeal'd; for
those made by <hi>Constantius,</hi> which were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
enough (if we believe <hi>Athanasius,</hi>
p. 821.) stood still in force till <hi>Iulian</hi> his
immedia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Successour came to the Crown.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> need not have given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
all this trouble to justifie the Actions of
the Primitive Christians, for they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
guilty of any that wanted an excuse;
for the Church under <hi>Iulian</hi> never own'd
those principles or practices that tended to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40781:36"/>
the dishonour of their Emperour, as has been
shew'd at large in the 2, 3, 4 Chapters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
of this book.</p>
            <p>I shall con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine my self no longer to the
Actions of a particular people or Nation, but
consider what is our duty as Christians in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to our Governours; and what sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
is due to them when they persecute
us according to Law, or destroy us by an
uncontrollable Arbitrary power.</p>
            <p>As to the first of these, the case is plain,
and agreed upon on all hands, that submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is necessarily requir'd to a Persecutour,
that acts according to the Laws of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
this Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> allows, <hi>p.</hi> 92. in these
words: [When the Laws of God and our
Country interfere, and 'tis made death by
the Law of the Land to be a good Christian,
then we are to lay down our lives for Christ's
sake.]</p>
            <p>So that all the dispute is about our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to a Persecutour, that acts without
the authority of the Law, and contrary to
it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> denies that Submission is due
to him by the Gospel, [<hi>ibid.</hi>] but I shall
make the contrary appear from the plain au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Holy Scriptures, the sense of
the Primitive Christians, as likewise from
that too of our present Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:40781:37"/>For, first, if we are not oblig'd to submit
to a Tyrant that acts contrary to the Law,
we may resist him, for there is no Medium,
flying being part of our Passive Obedience
that is acknowledg'd due to a Persecutour
that acts according to Law: but resisting is
not in any case allowable; for besides our
Saviour's own words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
'tis forbidden, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 17. to <hi>return any
man evil for evil.</hi> And again <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>Dearly
beloved, avenge not your selves, but rather
give place unto wrath: for it is written, Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
is mine, I will repay it, saith the Lord.</hi>
Now if no man may pay evil to his brother
that has injur'd him, but by the hand of the
Supreme Power, how can it be allowable to
render evil for evil to the Supreme Power
it self? It cannot be done but by a Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and He onely is God. We have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
indeed against the violence of our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
subject, by applying our selves to the
Magistrate, who may punish the offender,
being authorized by God so to doe [<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.
4.] But we don't find the People have the
like Power over the Magistrate: Obedience
is our business, which is inconsistent with
the liberty of resisting. <hi>Grotius</hi> tells us
plainly, <hi>Si, quia summum imperium habenti
libet, injuria nobis inferatur, toleranda potius
est quam vi resistendum;</hi> For though by the
Law of Nature we have the power of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40781:37"/>
injuries, yet we have a greater obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
from the Civil Government under
which we live, that wholly devests us of this
right. <hi>Potest igitur Civitas jus illud resistendi
promiscuum publicae pacis &amp; ordinis causâ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibere,</hi>
cap. 4. l. 2. de <hi>Iu. Bel.</hi> &amp; <hi>Pa.</hi> So
that this patient submitting to the Arbitrary
determinations of the Magistrate is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the doctrine of our Saviour, but
from the principl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of Civil prudence: For
the Lawyers will tell us, that a mischief is
better than an inconvenience; not that the
first formally consider'd is to be preferr'd to
the latter, but that an inconvenience, whose
consequence would reach unto the general,
should be prevented rather than a mischief,
that would onely endamage particular.
Hence it is that opposing the Magistrate is
forbid upon any terms whatsoever, since the
indulgence of it would bring a train of ill
consequences, ten times worse than all the
mischiefs we can possibly suffer from the
cruelty of a lawless Tyrant; For as <hi>Grotius</hi>
has it in his Commentary on the 13 of the
<hi>Romans, Reges constituuntur ut improbitate
repressa tutiùs vivant boni, hoc autem plenissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mè
praestant boni reges, mali quoque aliquatenus
vel sui causa, &amp; quanquam aliquando vitii
aliquid interveniat, nunquam tamen non tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiùs
est esse Principes, quam non esse: Rectè
ergo Tacitus, vitia erunt donec homines, sed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40781:38"/>
neque haec continua &amp; meliorum interventu
pensantur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was a Maxim the former Heathens learnt
from their Philosophers, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
and that this anger was not always suppos'd
to be just, a Latin saying, to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
will shew us, <hi>ames parentem si aequus est,
si non, feras;</hi> and that the same, if not much
greater difference is to be paid to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Father, is out of question.</p>
            <p>In some cases I allow it is lawfull not to
obey our Parent, or our King, but in all
cases 'tis necessary not to resist. St. <hi>Peter</hi>
Commands <hi>Servants to be subject to their
Masters, with all fear; not onely the good and
gentle, but also the froward; for this is thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
if a man for conscience-sake toward
God endure grief, suffering wrongfully:</hi> and
<hi>Grotius</hi> will tell us, <hi>Quod dicitur subjectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
dominis deberi etiam duris, idem ad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
quoque referendum.</hi> Nay we owe a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
submission to our Governours, than a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
doth to his Master; for if he complains
of wrongfull usage, redress is to be had from
the Magistrate; but we can onely appeal
to God.</p>
            <p>But to put this matter beyond all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
let's consider what St. <hi>Paul</hi> says,
Rom. 13. 2. <hi>Whosoever resists the power, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
the ordinance of God; and they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
shall receive to themselves damnation.</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:40781:38"/>
Here is a general rule laid down without
the least exception; and that it belongs to
us, will be evident, if we consider who gave
it St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who being the Apostle of the
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> what he delivers is universal. And
why should we presume to be wiser than the
Law, and make distinctions where we find
none? St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Whoever resists the
power, shall be damn'd.</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> tells
us, we may resist one that acts contrary to
Law: This distinction might be plausible,
if this wicked power were not the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God; but since it is (as I shall
evidently make out by and by) the resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Ordinance contracts a guilt, that
makes us obnoxious to eternal torments.
Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> indeed quotes <hi>Bracton</hi> to prove,
that a Magistrate can have no power from
God, to act contrary to the Law, <hi>Quia po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testas
juris solius Dei est, potestas autem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriae
Diaboli:</hi> But I wonder what Divine

a Case of Conscience; for I believe
<hi>Westminster-Hall</hi> Divinity is as bad as Pulpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law:
He may likewise, if he please, make
use of <hi>Scotch</hi> Politicks, and he will find his
Friend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Buchanan,</hi> of his opinion:
But St. <hi>Augustine</hi> will tell him (<hi>Praef.</hi> in <hi>Enar.</hi>
2 <hi>Ps.</hi> 29.) [Every evil man hath in himself
the will to hurt; but to be able to hurt, is
not in his power: In that he hath the will
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40781:39"/>
to hurt, he is already guilty; but that he
should have the ability, is permitted by the
secret dispensation of God's Providence;
toward some for Punishment; toward some
for Tryal; toward some for obtaining a
Crown: For punishment, as the <hi>Philistins</hi>
were permitted to subdue the people of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
because they had sinned against God:
For tryal, the Devil was permitted to assault
<hi>Iob;</hi> but <hi>Iob</hi> was tryed, the Devil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded:
For winning the Crown, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutours
were let loose against the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs;
the Martyrs were slain, the Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
thought they had gotten the day;
these did falsly triumph in publick, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were truly crown'd in secret: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that he is permitted to deal against any,
proceedeth from the secret dispensation of
God's Providence; but that he hath a will
to hurt, cometh from the man himself.] Here
we see opposing even a Persecutour, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
the Ordinance of God (since he
hath his power from above,) and what
the consequence of that is, no Christian can
be ignorant of. Now that this was not Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
spoken by that Great Father, but his
setled opinion, is plain from his constant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
to it: For in another place he says,
(<hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>de C. D. c.</hi> 8.) [From whom [God]
are all powers, howsoever all mens wills are
not from him;] and again (<hi>Id. de Na. Bon.</hi> &amp;c.)
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40781:39"/>
[The power even of hurtfull Kings is from
God.] <hi>Theod.</hi> likewise on the 13 to the
<hi>Romans, Quum vult eos qui peccant castigare
à malis Magistratibus regi permittit.</hi> And <hi>Isi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi>
tells us plainly, [Hence we see both a
bad and good power is ordained by God,
<hi>Bonam propitio, malam irato;</hi> for we owe
good Kings to the gift of God, but evil ones
to our sins; <hi>Reges quando boni sunt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, quando vero mali sceleris est Populi.</hi>]
But some may say the Fathers are men, and
consequently may err; to obviate this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
I shall add the undoubted authority of
Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. <hi>There is no power but
of God, and the powers that be are ordained
of God:</hi> and <hi>Iob</hi> 34. 10. <hi>God maketh a
wicked man to reign for the sins of the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since therefore 'tis plain from these many
instances, that the power of wicked Princes
is from God, our resistance cannot be any
ways warrantable: We may as well quarrel
with Providence for sending Plagues among
us, or murmur at the Almighty when he vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits
us with his Judgments, as resist a Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutour;
for he is sent to punish us for our
sins; he is onely the instrument, the rod in
God's hand, which we ought rather to kiss
than burn.</p>
            <p>I hope it has been sufficiently proved from
the Scriptures, and Sense of the Fathers, that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40781:40"/>
the power of wicked Princes is from God,
and consequently it is our duty to submit to
them, though they act never so illegally.
It remains now, that I should prove, that
this is likewise the Doctrine of our present
Church; and here I might refer my Reader
to all the Writings of our Eminent Divines
since the Reformation, whose business it
has been to preach up Obedience to Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
and have unanimously declar'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
resistance upon any terms whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
I might transcribe great part of Bishop
<hi>Bilson,</hi> Bishop <hi>Taylour</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond's</hi>
Tracts upon this subject, but I shall rather
chuse onely to quote the Homilies, it being
agreed on all sides, that in them is contain'd
the true Doctrine of our Church; and
Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> deservedly stiles them the next
best book to the Bible. I wish he could
commend them upon his own knowledge;
but I am afraid he never read any more of
them than serv'd for a present purpose, and
cares as little for them otherwise as the
Country people do: For if he had met with
the Homilies against Rebellion and Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
we should never have had that asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>p.</hi> 92. That the onely Case wherein the
Gospel requires Passive Obedience, is when
the Laws are against a man: For in the first
Homily against Disobedience and Wilfull
Rebellion, there are these words, [We
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40781:40"/>
shall find in very many and almost infinite
places in Holy Scripture, as well of the Old
Testament as the New; as well the Evil as
the Good do reign by God's Ordinance, and
we are bound to obey them.] And again—
[It cometh not of chance and fortune (as
they term it) nor of the ambition of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
men and women climing up of their own
accord to dominion, that there be Kings,
Queens and Princes, and other Governours
over men, being their Subjects; but All Kings
and Queens and other Governours are espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
appointed by the Ordinance of God.]
—And again, [What shall Subjects doe
then? shall they obey the valiant, stout,
wise and good Princes, and contemn, diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
and rebell against Children, or against
indiscreet and evil Governours? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>] And the reason follows—[For a
Rebell is worse than the worst Prince, and
Rebellion worse than the worst Government
of the worst Prince that hitherto has been.]
—And in another place, [Shall the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
both by their wickedness provoke God
for their deserved punishment, to give them
an undiscrect or evil Prince, and also rebell
against them, and also against God, who for
the punishment of their sins did give them
such a Prince?] I am weary of transcribing
out of a Book that ought to be almost as
well known to us as our Bibles; but I can't
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40781:41"/>
forbear to insert this passage, which is so
pertinent to the business in hand, and makes
it plain that we ought by our repentance
to avert the miseries of a wicked Prince, and
not by resisting his power; the words are
these,—[Let us take away our wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that provok'd God to set such an one
over us, and God will either displace him,
or of an evil Prince, make him a good
Prince; so that we first change our evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
good; for Subjects to deserve through
their sins, to have an evil Prince, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell
against him were double and treble
evil, by provoking God more to plague
them: Nay, let us either deserve to have a
good Prince, or let us patiently suffer and
obey such as we deserve.]</p>
            <p>Having thus secur'd the Supreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
from the violence of his Subjects, it
will be necessary to take some care of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Officers; whose power, since it is the
Ordinance of God (for <hi>Epiphanius</hi> proves,
that the many Magistrates under one King
are Ordain'd of God, from the 13 to the
<hi>Romans</hi>) ought no more to be resisted than
the King's.</p>
            <p>Though this may seem something harsh
in an English man's ears, who will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
perhaps that the King can doe no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
and is above the censure of the Law,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40781:41"/>
yet he knows his Officers are accountable
for any illegal act; and the very Command
of the Prince cannot secure them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impeach't by the People: granting this
to be very true; yet I shall still assert, that
the inferiour Magistrate, though in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of an illegal act is not to be repell'd
by force; for though <hi>Bracton</hi> tells us, <hi>Ei
qui vult viribus uti erit viriliter resistendum;</hi>
and the law in our own defence permits us
to kill our enemy,<note place="margin">R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>f 17. 18.</note> yet (as it is sufficiently
declar'd before) we sin in so doing; and
though we escape here, judgment will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
us hereafter. Let's hear St. <hi>Peter's</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in the case, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13, 14, 15. <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
your selves unto every ordinance of man
for the Lord's sake, whether to the King as
supreme, or unto governours, as unto them
that are sent by him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>—For this is the will
of God,</hi> &amp;c.—From this 'tis plain that we
ought to submit to inferiour Officers for the
Lord's sake, as well as supreme; this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
power being from God, though
not immediately: This is sufficiently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
in our Saviour's answer to <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
Thou couldst have no power over me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it were given thee from above;</hi> and we
all know he was under the Emperour.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant that the above-cited
Text from St. <hi>Peter</hi> has been perverted to
serve upon a far different occasion; the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40781:42"/>
proper translation of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Ordinance giving occasion to some
ignorant or ill-minded people to infer, that
all government is of humane institution; but
to any considering man 'tis plain, that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
here signifies a <hi>person,</hi> and not a <hi>thing,</hi> from
the division subjoyn'd, whether it be to
Kings as Supreme, or Governours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
therefore the best Translation runs, <hi>Submit
your selves to every humane creature.</hi> Here it
may be objected, that this explication is too
large, because undoubtedly we are not to
submit to all men: To this I answer, that
sentenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s deliver'd in general terms are not
always to be taken in their full extent; but
restrictions are allowable, provided they are
had from parallel places in Scripture; for
this Command of <hi>subjecting our selves to all
men,</hi> implies no more but this, We must <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
our selves to all men to whom submission
is due:</hi> of <hi>Haymo</hi> in <hi>Rom. 13. Subditi estote
omni creaturae, i.e. omnibus hominibus nobis
praepositis.</hi> But that which gives colour for
the allowance of this restriction, is the like
expression in the same Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 17. where
we are <hi>commanded to honour all men.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the meaning of this is not that the
King should honour his Subjects, or the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Children. But as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in
his Paraphrase on the place, [Give every
man the Honour and Obedience that is due
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40781:42"/>
to him:] and St. <hi>Paul</hi> confirms this, <hi>Rom.</hi>
13. 7. <hi>Give all men their due, Tribute to
whom tribute—Honour to whom honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to make this point of our submission
to under O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> possible, let us
consider the example of our Saviour, who
when he was set upon by a great multitude
with swords and staves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who certainly
acted very illegally, for they had no just
Commission for what they did, nor could
have (for our Saviour tells them, <hi>Luke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>2.
53. This is your hour, and the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi>
which Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> explains in his
Paraphrase, [This is the time when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and you are permitted to work your
wills on me.] Yet he was so far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
them (though he had ten Millions
of Angels at his command) that he severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rebuked <hi>Peter</hi> for drawing his sword in
his defence, and bid him put it up, for <hi>all
that take the sword, shall perish by the sword.</hi>
Here we see our Saviour doth not onely
encourage us by his example to submit pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
to those that wrongfully assault us,
but by his Precept enjoy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s it as our duty;
he doth not leave it at our disposal, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we will submit or no; nor is this one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Counsel of Perfection, which brings
honour and reward to those that keep it;
but to those that doe not, no manner of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40781:43"/>
danger at all (as Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> speaks, <hi>p.</hi> 68.
from <hi>Greg. Naz.</hi>) for we see here a penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
threatned to the resister; though if any
case might be excepted, this ought to claim
the privilege, for the sword could never be
drawn in a better cause, or by a better
hand: But the Precept is universal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable.
St. <hi>Peter</hi> himself must not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
though to defend his Saviour.</p>
            <p>This is a hard lesson (I know) to flesh
and blood, but we must not Consult them
when we are to take up the Cross; which
is the indispensable duty of every Christian,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 12. And again, <hi>Heb. 11. 6, 7, 8.
For whom the Lord loveth, he chas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope I have not omitted any thing in
Mr. <hi>Iohnson's</hi> book that might deserve the
least Consideration; but to make the surer
work, it will be necessary to make some
particular remarks upon those five Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>p.</hi> 92. into which he tells us there he
has reduced the force and strength of what
was formerly delivered in his Book.</p>
            <p>1. Christianity destroys no man's natural
or civil Rights, but confirms them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:40781:43"/>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Christianity doth not at all meddle
with our Civil Rights [1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 20, 21.
with Dr. <hi>Hammond's</hi> Paraphrase.] And as
for Natural Rights, some it has confirm'd,
but destroy'd others; for many things were
lawfull to us as men, which are not so as
Christians. Nay, there were many things
allow'd under the <hi>Iewish</hi> Oeconomy, which
Christ hath absolutely forbid; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
in this case of private revenge, and
resisting the unlawfull Oppressour. See
<hi>Matth.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43. with
Dr. <hi>Hammond's</hi> Paraphrase.</p>
            <p>2. All men have a natural and civil Right
and Property in their Lives, till they have
forfeited them by the Laws of their Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> We had indeed a natural Right to
our Lives, and we might have defended
them by force, and those weapons that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
had bestowed upon us; but this Right
is superseded not onely by the Maxims of
Christianity, but Civil policy too (as has
been shewn from <hi>Grotius</hi>); and we can no
more defend our Lives by violence, than we
can destroy them upon private discontent;
both the preserving and destroying the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
being lodg'd in the hands of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Magistrate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:40781:44"/>3. When the Laws of God and our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
interfere, and it is made death by the
Law of the Land to be a good Christian,
then we are to lay down our lives for Christ's
sake. This is the onely case wherein the
Gospel requires Passive Obedience, namely,
when the Laws are against a man: And
this was the case of the first Christians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The rule of our Obedience and
Submission is universal, there is no person
excepted; nay, 'tis plain from Scripture that
we ought not onely to submit when the
Laws are against us, but when they are for
us, and we are illegally opprest: For if our
Saviour commands us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 38, 39, &amp;c.
not to resist a private person that offer'd us
an injury, (which is certainly illegal, and
acknowledged so all over the world, since
he acts without so much as any pretended
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>thority) how much rather ought we to
submit to the Magistrate, though he acts
contrary to Law; for besides the general
obligation we have just now mentioned,
there is another that more particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains
us, <hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Command, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to his power as he is a Magistrate, and
cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>quently ordained by God.</p>
            <p>2. The Laws were no more against the
first Christians, than they were against those
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40781:44"/>
under <hi>Iulian;</hi> for they suffered both by the
same Law, <hi>viz.</hi> the uncontrollable will of
their Emperour.</p>
            <p>4. That killing a man contrary to Law
is Murther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I can't grant this universally true,
for sometimes 'tis more than Murther, <hi>viz.</hi>
Treason, sometimes less, <hi>viz.</hi> Manslaughter:
but that Murther is Murther, I allow. I
hope the Reader will pardon the seeming
lightness of this Answer, since it is necessary
to shew how hard it is for Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> to
speak truth or sense in the most trivial
concerns.</p>
            <p>5. That every man is bound to prevent
Murther as far as the Law allows, and ought
not to submit to be Murthered if he can
help it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> How plausible soever this seems, 'tis
utterly false: We ought indeed to prevent
Murther by all the means our Laws com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
for they can command nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Scriptures, but not by those
they barely allow; for 'tis evident from
what has been delivered already, that the
Law permits some means that are not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
by the Gospel, and those we must
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40781:45"/>
not, cannot use; for we ought not to damn
our selves to prevent the violence of a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer,
though offered to our selves; for our
Saviour assures us we don't lose our lives by
this patient submission to death, but gain
them.</p>
            <p>'Twill not be impertinent now to take
notice of some Quotations pickt up out of
<hi>Bracton,</hi> to countenance Mr. <hi>Iohnson's</hi> Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
<hi>p.</hi> 83. who certainly has a peculiar
way of perverting the sense of Authours:
For how else could he arm <hi>Bracton</hi> against
his Prince? who, good man! little thought
his authority should be made use of to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
disobedience, or to pull down the
Prerogative, of which he really was so just
and vigorous a defender: But our Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>books
may well be debaucht to serve the
purposes of ill men, when the Bible is, and
<hi>Bracton</hi> has not so much reason to complain
of the injury, since he hath St. <hi>Paul</hi> for a
fellow Sufferer: The substance of all he
cites from <hi>Bracton</hi> is this; <hi>Rex est sub Deo
&amp; sub Lege quia Lex facit Regem.</hi> If Mr.
<hi>Iohnson</hi> would but let <hi>Bracton</hi> interpret
himself, we should have none of the absurd
inferences he makes, <hi>p.</hi> 83. for he tells us,

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40781:45"/>
there is no more power allowed to the Law,
than there is to the Earls and Barons; and
that they can't civilly oblige the King to
Obedience, but onely morally oblige his
Conscience when he is persuaded their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
are just, I am sure Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> himself
will allow: Therefore 'tis evident that those
words cannot relate to any coercive power,
but onely directive; for he says just before,
<hi>Nec factum Regis nec Chartam potest quis ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicare
ita quod factum Domini Regis irrite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur:</hi>
And what he delivers in the following
words, onely implies a Moral superiority,
by reason of a directive power in the Law,
and likewise in the Earls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not any civil
jurisdiction or coercive power; for he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
<hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 17. that for all the ill the
King can doe, God onely can punish him:
<hi>Satis sufficit ei pro poena quod Dominum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
ultorem.</hi> This is enough to satisfie
those that never did, and perhaps never
may see <hi>Bracton's</hi> Books of the meaning of
that great Lawyer; as for those that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
him, they know that he of all men is
not in the least guilty of any saying that
may derogate from the Prerogative of the
Prince, for he has evidently made it his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
to justifie it in its fullest extent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:40781:46"/>I might here conclude, but that Mr. <hi>Iohn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
will give us another touch of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Christians, <hi>p.</hi> 93. where he tells us
we have no occasion for that admirable
example of the <hi>Thebaean</hi> Legion: If he had
not forgot the Service of the Church, he
would know the patience of Martyrs was
not onely the business of our imitation,
but the subject of our prayers too: And
though we have not always occasion to
follow their example, yet it is our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
duty to thank God for it. And
therefore in the most peacefully settled times
this sad story is not impertinent from the
Pulpit; we have solemn days to Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate
the sufferings of our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
and the Apostles: And though the
Church has not thought fit to give this
glorious Action a place in the Kalendar,
it ought certainly to be eternally fixt in
our Memories; for then if ill times should
come (and if we consider impartially God's
justice and our own sins, we have little
reason to expect otherwise) the Example
and Conduct of the <hi>Thebaean</hi> Legion will
be of great use to us; there we shall see
Souldiers dye with the same Meen they
used to triumph; and Chieftains not inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their Souldiers with Courage, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilling
the softer Maxims of Patience: <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherius</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:40781:46"/>
tells the Emperour (after a second
Decemation of the Legion, and upon his
Command to destroy them all) [Despair
it self, O Emperour, which is strongest in
dangers, hath not arm'd us against thee:
Behold we have weapons, and yet offer not
to resist, because we had rather dye than
overcome, chusing rather to dye innocent,
than live guilty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] No body but Mr.
<hi>Iohnson</hi> would say this great Example is not
universally to be imitated; and his reason is,
because they suffered according to the Laws
of their Country. This shift of his has been
sufficiently exposed already; but that he
may not have the least pretence to it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
I shall shew that the Christians under
<hi>Iulian</hi> had power to resist (and he declares
the Laws were for them,) and yet they did
not; so that his assertion, <hi>p.</hi> 94. that they
would if they could; and consequently
that we may, is utterly false. Now that
the Christians were able, appears from all
the Historians that speak of that age; for
not onely the greatest part of the world were
Christians, but <hi>Iulian's</hi> Army was entirely
so; for when they chose <hi>Iovinian</hi> for their
Emperour, he refused the Honour, telling
them, That since he was a Christian, he
could not Command over Heathens; but
they all, with one accord, cried out, We are
Christians.] <hi>Rusin.</hi> l. 2. c. 1. <hi>Theodoret</hi> is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40781:47"/>
more full in this case; for he makes the
Army tell him, that he shall command Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
that were ever bred up to that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>]
for those that
were elder, had <hi>Constantine</hi> for their Teacher,
the younger <hi>Constantius;</hi> nay, they assure
him they could not be Heathens, for <hi>Iulian</hi>
did not live long enough to pervert them:
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
<hi>Th. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 1. This Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi>
himself knew, for all he saith, <hi>p.</hi> 94. [What
would they have a few desenceless Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
doe, when they had lost their strength,
and so many of their numbers?] for in his
Preface, <hi>p.</hi> 25. he quotes St. <hi>Aug.</hi> in <hi>Ps.</hi> 124.
who there saith, [Though <hi>Iulian</hi> was an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postate,
an Oppressour and Idolater, yet
Christian Souldiers served under him.] Now
whether these were unarm'd or defenceless
when they were to fight, let any reasonable
man judge; and for their Numbers, I appeal
to the Historians.</p>
            <p>Thus I hope I have performed my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
<hi>viz.</hi> 1. I have shewn the Unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Excluding the next Heir upon the
account of his Religion, and that it is a
practice altogether unknown to the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Christians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:40781:47"/>2. I have proved the necessity of Passive
Obedience from the Scripture, the Sense of
the Primitive Fathers, and the Doctrine of
our present Church.</p>
            <p>3. I have not left any thing unanswered
in <hi>Iulian,</hi> &amp;c. that opposed the Right of the
next Heir, or justified Resistance.</p>
            <p>As for the latter part of the Book, since
I am not concerned in the Vindication of
the Papists, I shall leave it to the censure
of those that are. But I must needs say, that
Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> had more effectually routed the
Papists, if he had rather set down the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with which those great Men confuted
their Doctrines, than onely the Rhetorick
they exposed them with; for we, (whether
it be the civility or judgment of the age, I
shan't determine) are not much affected
with the Old <hi>Elizabeth-</hi>way of railing.</p>
