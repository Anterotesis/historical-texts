            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Tranſlation of this Book into Engliſh Proſe, by an excellent Hand, which might have ſeemed juſtly to ſuperſede my farther Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55884:4"/>I cannot but flatter my ſelf, that in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places I have removed ſome Clouds, and made the Arguments more eaſy to be comprehended, by taking from their length.</p>
            <p>The Truths here propounded, are of that nature, that me-thinks the Mind ſhould be eager to come to the proof of them, and impatient even of Ornaments which may detain from the full view of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Features.</p>
            <p>If however this Verſion appear dull and flat, I hope it will be conſidered that it is but a Copy of a Copy; and if I had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Original Dutch Poem, as I ſhould have had more aſſiſtance to Fancy, I know not but I might have offered here ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more Poetical.</p>

                  <l>The Cruelty of the old <hi>Pagan</hi> Rites,</l>

                  <l>But the Religion of the Jews, indeed,</l>
                  <l>Allow'd no wicked or diſhoneſt Deed;</l>
                  <l>Yet loads of Ceremonies it enjoyn'd,</l>

                  <l>Our Hands from ev'ry Work not to withdraw;</l>

                  <l>But the chief Proof of our Religion's ſhown,</l>

                  <hi>CHAP.

               <p>OF all the Arguments excellently urg'd by <hi>Grotius,</hi> and but enervated by my Rythms, there is none which ſeems more undeniably to enforce the belief of a Deity, and the Religion which Chriſt Jeſus taught
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55884:81"/>
Mankind, than the Evidence that there have been, at leaſt in ſome Ages of the World, ſuch Predictions as have manifeſted a fore-knowledg of thoſe future Events, of which it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to have the leaſt intimation from any Cauſe, or Sign, appearing only by natural Light; and that ſuch an one as the bleſſed Jeſus, had been fore-ſhewn, and was accordingly expected, about that time when he firſt convers'd among Men.</p>
               <p>Numbers not injudicious, may be impos'd upon with appearances ſeemly miraculous, either by a Confederacy, flight of hand, or natural Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, in applying the occult Qualities of things new and ſtrange.</p>
               <p>But it muſt evidently be beyond all humane Power, to know future things in their remote Cauſes, the Cauſes themſelves not exiſting till many Ages after; nay, where the Cauſes act ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily, and conſequently the Effects are wholly contingent.</p>
               <p>Whether the Inſtruments of conveying to Mankind the notices of ſuch things, were actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by good or bad Spirits, is not of any Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence here; ſince if they were bad, it ſhews the influence of a ſuperiour Being, which makes the very Devils ſubſervient to that Power, which was to deſtroy their Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And it cannot but be look'd upon as a great Mercy and Providence of God, that he not only left witneſs of himſelf among the Jews,<note place="margin">Acts 14.15.</note> in thoſe Prophecies, which ſufficiently pointed out the Time, Place, Perſon, and Character of the <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah.</hi> But that the Gentiles might have no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that theſe were Juggles, and a meer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy againſt their ancient and eſtabliſh'd Rites,

he ſo ordered it, That the Roman Capitol ſhould become a Sanctuary, and Depoſitory of theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truths; That there the Sibylline Writings, which deſcribe that pacific Prince, who was to be born of a Virgin, ſo clearly, that thence is now taken the main Objection againſt their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſhould be preſerved with that care, which might prevent all manner of ſcruples with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biaſ'd minds, againſt thoſe mighty Teſtimonies to Chriſtianity.</p>

               <p>Nay, there was great care taken that they might not be cheated with new, or falſe Copies; when in <hi>Tiberius</hi> his time,<note place="margin">Corn. Tacitus in vitâ Tiberii, lib. 6. <hi>p.</hi> 150, 160. Ed. Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tini.</note> 
                  <hi>Caninius Gallus,</hi> one of the <hi>Quindecemvirs,</hi> preſs'd for a Decree of the Senate, for having a Book then found, treaſured among the other Writings of the <hi>Sibyls</hi> (whether
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55884:82"/>
there was but one, or more, <hi>Tacitus,</hi> who relates it, would not determine.) <hi>Tiberius</hi> tells him by Letter, that he was ignorant what was the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cuſtom upon ſuch a diſcovery, which was, to have every Verſe read and weighed in full Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate before it was received, and then the matter was to be left to the Prieſts, that they might uſe all poſſible humane means for diſcerning the true from falſe.</p>
               <p>That the Chriſtians therefore could not cheat them in this matter, and would have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by authority of the Senate, if they made any falſe Quotations, cannot be doubted.</p>
               <p>The only Queſtion remaining is, How the Chriſtians could come by any of theſe Writings, which were kept with ſo much caution, that none were admitted to them but the immediate Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers intruſted with them, nor could they publiſh them without a Decree from the Senate: And further yet, as it is in <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Letter menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by <hi>Tacitus, Auguſtus</hi> made a Law,<note place="margin">Tacitus lib. 6. p. 160.

               <p n="3">3. Thoſe Writings which were kept in the Capitol before <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his time, were for the moſt part Tranſcripts from what were recorded in ſeveral parts of <hi>Greece;</hi> from amongſt theſe and others, <hi>Auguſtus</hi> made his Collection; and as it was no difficult thing to have recourſe to thoſe places, from whence any of them had been tranſcribed; no more was it to have ſufficient Evidence, which, among the Verſes ſo recorded, were tranſcribed and carried into the Capitol.</p>
               <p>Upon which Conſiderations, I ſhould think it no more ſtrange, that many Sibylline Writings ſhould be in the hands of Chriſtians while the Capitol ſtood, agreeing with Verſes there recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, than that ſeveral Copies of any Book, ſhould agree with the ſame Original: and as the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, by quoting the <hi>Sibyls</hi> to the Heathens, ſhewed their aſſurance that the Quotations were
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:55884:84"/>
right, and of ſuch Writings as the Heathens themſelves received for Authorities; ſo their not being diſproved in particular inſtances, ſhews, that that aſſurance was well grounded.</p>
               <p>And this will be further evident, if any one of the Apoſtles at any time uſed theſe Authorities, either to Heathens, or Chriſtians; for tho this Argument was not ſo neceſſary, that we ought to ſuppoſe the Apoſtles inſpired to know the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of theſe Verſes, before they came to their hands: Yet we cannot think, that the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which was to lead them into all Truth, would ſuffer them to quote any thing adulterate; nor is it to be imagined that any Chriſtian then, could have counterfeited theſe Verſes, and not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>

               <p>That this paſſage is not to be found among the Writings of St. <hi>Paul</hi> now extant, is not of it ſelf of greater weight, than if any of the Primitive Chriſtians ſhould have mentioned ſome expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or action of our Saviour's, of which a clear Tradition then ran; tho it were not recorded by any of the Evangeliſts: whereas St. <hi>John</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding his Goſpel, ſays;</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II. Clement</hi>'s Quotation of St. <hi>Paul</hi> vindicated from <hi>Vandale</hi>'s Objection; and his Authorities from <hi>Tully</hi> turned upon him.</head>
               <p>SEveral Objections againſt the Authority of the Sibylline Writings have been heretofore made by <hi>Iſaac Caſaubon, David Blondel,</hi> and others, who are fully anſwered by my Learned Friend Dr. <hi>Twiſden,</hi>

               <p>I find but two Heads inſiſted on by <hi>Vandale,</hi> which may ſeem to deſerve a particular Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is, his endeavour to prove by St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, that he never urg'd the Sibylline, or other Ethnick Predictions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other is, <hi>Vandale</hi>'s improvement of what occurs in <hi>Tully,</hi> relating to the Sibylline Predictions.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:55884:85"/>1. His authority from St. <hi>Paul</hi> is taken out of <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.5, 6. concerning the knowledg of the myſtery of Chriſt: one Verſe of which,<note place="margin">Vandale, <hi>p.</hi> 7.</note> leaving out the other, <hi>Vandale</hi> has taken the liberty to render,<note place="margin">Verſ. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Quod nullis aliis ſaeculis declaratum ſit hominum generi; ut ſuo tempore patefactum eſſet Sanctis DEI Apoſtolis, ac Prophetis, divinâ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiratione.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Which was not declared to Mankind in any other Age; that in its, or his time, it might be revealed to God's holy Apoſtles and Prophets, by divine Inſpiration.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If this were a true Tranſlation, it might go a great way towards his Concluſion, that the whole Myſtery was reſerved for the Apoſtles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of that time.</p>
               <p>But this differs widely from the Original.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which in former Generations, or Ages, was not made known unto the Sons of Men, as it is now, or in this Age, revealed unto his holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Prophets, by the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Gentiles ſhould be fellow-Heirs,</hi>

                  <hi>and of the ſame body, and partakers of his Promiſe in Chriſt by the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any of the <hi>Sibyls</hi> wrote but within that Age wherein Chriſt was born, their Predictions might come within this Proviſion.</p>
               <p>However 'tis evident from the Text, that God's Spirit had communicated this divine Light to the Gentiles, or at leaſt for the benefit of them, as well as of others; and no more can be inferr'd to <hi>Vandale</hi>'s purpoſe, than that the Spirit of Prophecy was more reſtrain'd in former times.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55884:86"/>
To ſay there were no Revelations before concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> were to deny the holy Writ which records the Prophecies among the Jews; nay,<note place="margin">Numb. 24.17.</note> and that of <hi>Baalam</hi> the <hi>Moabitiſh</hi> Sorcerer.</p>
               <p>Yet there is no doubt but the Apoſtles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets under the Goſpel, had a more ſteady Light to guide them; and herein the Sibyls ſeem to have been far ſhort of the Chriſtian or Jewiſh Prophets.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they themſelves underſtood not the true meaning of what they ſpake in a Divine Fury.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor could they bring any Evidence to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the World of the truth of what they fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told; and therefore, how clear ſoever the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions ſeemed by the Event, they were obſcure till then, and of little or no uſe at firſt, eſpecially incompariſon with thoſe which were uttered for the Comfort of God's People, and were often publickly atteſted by convincing Miracles.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And the People among whom they were delivered, had not thoſe Anticipations, or Pre-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, which might fit them for the recieving that Light. So that what would have brought clear Day to others, could make but a very little dawning with them, by reaſon of that thick Darkneſs which encompaſs'd them; and upon that account their Light was to be accounted weak, as not able to diſperſe the Clouds which lay in the way; and by how much the ſtronger Rays were requiſite; by ſo much were their illuminations the more imperfect.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Cic. de Div. <hi>lib.</hi> 1.</note>2. The ſecond Head obſervable in <hi>Vandale</hi> is, what he urges out of <hi>Tully,</hi> who, in his firſt

Book of Divination, repreſents his Brother <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctius</hi> his Arguments to ſhew, that there was ſuch a thing as a fore-knowledg of future Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences; for which <hi>Tully</hi> owns, that he brought many <note n="(a)" place="margin">Quodque me maximè delectat, pluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus noſtris ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplis uſus es iis quidem cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris &amp; illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.

               <p>Being to anſwer his Brothers Arguments he ſays; He <note n="(b)" place="margin">Dicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum eſt mihi igitur adeo quae ſunt à te dicta; ſed ita nihil ut affirmem, quaerem omnia, dubitans plerumque, &amp; mihi ipſe diffidens, ib.</note>

               </p>
               <p>And that which he ſeems moſt to triumph in, is,<note place="margin">Divinationem eſſe earum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum praedictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentionem, quae eſſent fortuitae. v. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. &amp; 2.</note> rather a cavilling at the definition of Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given by his Brother, than a diſproving the poſſibility that the Gods ſhould certainly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know what is to come to paſs, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate that knowledg to Men, without deſtroying the nature of Contingency by any compelling neceſſity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When he comes to object againſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Sibylline Writings, one Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is their obſcurity,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tully</hi>'s firſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt the Sibyls.</note> and the uncertainty of Time, Perſon, or the like, to which they may be applied: But in this <hi>Vandale</hi> and I, may ſay all Diſputers againſt theſe ſince our Saviour's time, are ſo far from agreeing with <hi>Cicero,</hi> that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection moſt commonly inſiſted on, is, their clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and certainty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another is, that the Acroſticks, in which ſort of Verſe the Predictions, or moſt of them, were wrote,<note place="margin">Vid. Vandale, <hi>pag.</hi> 39.</note> ſhew them to be rather the Effect of Art and Diligence, than of Incitation and Fury: As if that Power which inſpired the Sibyl,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:55884:87"/>
could not as well do it in that manner, as in one more negligent: Beſides, it could not derogate from the Prediction, if the ſubſtance of what was imprinted on the Mind, from whatever Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, was afterwards regularly digeſted; if this were before what was foretold came to paſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The laſt Objection is againſt the Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Officers, who were entruſted with this their ſacred Poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>One of the Predictions, which in <hi>Tully</hi>'s time was pronounced as fitting for the occaſion on which they were then conſulted, being that men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by Grotius.<note place="margin">Vid. Lib. 4. §. 9.</note>

               <p>This <hi>Lentulus</hi> was very ambitious of, and had a former Decree of the Senate on his ſide: <hi>Cicero</hi> lays a project for his performing this,<note place="margin">Vid.

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> What is offered in the two foregoing Chapters, confirm'd by <hi>Virgil</hi>'s fourth Eclogue, and the Tranſlation of it aſſerted.</head>
               <p>THat the firſt was meant of the Salvation of Mankind, by one, whom all ought to own for King, can be no queſtion to any who ſhall impartially conſider the firſt Eclogue of <hi>Virgil</hi> in the Original, or my Eſſay towards a Tranſlation of it; which, tho it loſe much of the Spirit by the Transfuſion, I ſhall here juſtify to be ſo far true, that there is nothing inſerted or varied from the genuine import of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Expreſſions, to make the Prediction more plainly to denote our Saviour, than <hi>Virgil</hi>'s account makes it.</p>
               <p>Tho <hi>Vandale</hi> thinks it a meer Dream that <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> or others,<note place="margin">Vandale <hi>p.</hi> 90.</note> were permitted the Inſpection of the Sibylline Verſes through <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his favour,<note place="margin">Quicquid non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulli ſomnient <hi>p.</hi> 460.</note> yet elſewhere he owns, that tho the Books were not to be conſulted without a Decree of the Senate; yet in <hi>Jul. Caeſar</hi>'s time the Officers made an inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the ſole Authority or Direction of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who was Emperour, and Chief Pontif: And if in this the ancient courſe of expecting the Senate's Decree was broken, why might not <hi>Auguſtus</hi> as well break the other, and order that a private Perſon ſhould have the inſpection?</p>
               <p>But however <hi>Vandale</hi> himſelfe owns,<note place="margin">Vandale <hi>p.</hi> 364.</note> that theſe Verſes were diſperſt through all <hi>Grecia, Aſia, Africa,</hi> and other Regions, when <hi>Auguſtus</hi> made
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:55884:90"/>
his Collection; and where <hi>Virgil</hi> ſaw them is not greatly material here, but that he had ſeen Verſes which paſs'd for <hi>Cumaean Sibyl's,</hi> and wrote to one who is preſumed not to have been unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them, appears, when he ſays;
<q>

               </p>
               <p>Nor can <hi>Pollio</hi> well be thought to have been a Stranger to the Predictions of the <hi>Sibyls,</hi> being the firſt,<note place="margin">Vid. Tallents Tab. Chron.</note> who, by <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his order, afterwards made a publick Library at <hi>Rome;</hi> which muſt have been, as he was thought the fitteſt for ſuch a charge.</p>
               <p>The Commentators ſeem induſtriouſly to caſt a Cloud over <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Repreſentation of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, which he mentions to <hi>Pollio:</hi> and will have it that this Poem was made to celebrate the Birth of <hi>Pollio</hi>'s Son, that ſome Eclogues are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by <hi>Virgil</hi> to <hi>Pollio</hi> himſelf, others to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi> the reſt to the Son of <hi>Pollio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where they ſeem to mind neither the time when it was wrote, the manner of the Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor the contexture of the Poem, which of one of the moſt noble and beſt turn'd that <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> ever wrote, they would make confuſed, and unworthy any Man of Judgment.</p>
               <p>The Poem it ſelf ſhews, that 'twas compoſed in <hi>Pollio</hi>'s Conſulſhip, which was in the Year 713,<note place="margin">Pighii Annales Rom. <hi>f.</hi> 484.</note> after the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> about 14 before Chriſt, this was during the <hi>Triumvirat</hi> of <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius, Anthony,</hi> and <hi>Lepidus;</hi> wherefore I cannot think that there is any ground to believe, that <hi>Virgil</hi> ſpake otherwiſe, than only of what ſhould happen in <hi>Pollio</hi>'s Conſulſhip, when he ſays,

                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:55884:90"/>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This indeed a great Poet has rendred,

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And the Commentators take <hi>Te Duce,</hi> to be the ſame with <hi>Te Authore,</hi> and that <hi>Virgil</hi> means either <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> or <hi>Pollio,</hi> and the Crimes to be the Civil Wars, between <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> at <hi>Mutina:</hi> whereas this was before <hi>Octavius</hi> took the name of <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> nor is there any thing to lead to him here: Beſides, <hi>Octavius</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> were reconciled at leaſt the Year before <hi>Pollio</hi>'s Conſulſhip, and <hi>Pollio</hi> was on <hi>Anthony</hi>'s ſide while the diviſion laſted;<note place="margin">V. Epit. ad Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium <hi>lib.</hi> 120.</note> ſo that there is no colour to think that <hi>Virgil</hi> meant that <hi>Pollio</hi> was to compoſe the Civil War after it was over, or to impute to him the Succeſs of the oppoſite Party.</p>
               <p>There were more of colour in the Suppoſition,<note place="margin">V.

could not be meant of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who aſſumed not that name till the Battel of <hi>Actium</hi> was over, which was about the Year of <hi>Rome</hi> 718, five Years after <hi>Pollio</hi>'s Conſulſhip, when this Poem was wrote.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we obſerve the manner of the Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we ſhall find, that whereas <hi>Pollio</hi>'s Son is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the chief Subject of the Poem; how much ſoever a Poet may be allowed to ſtrain his Characters, no Man can imagine that <hi>Virgil</hi> would aſcribe ſuch high and mighty things to the Son of a Conſul, when he was little more than Titular, under the check of the <hi>Triumvirs;</hi> durſt he call him the Offspring of the Gods, the great encreaſe of <hi>Jove,</hi> and ſuppoſe that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the Golden Age, and that Heaven it ſelf expects ſupport from him? this would have been no leſs than <hi>Crimen laeſae Majeſtatis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to put this out of Controverſy, 'tis all applied to one who was expected to be born; when the Commentors will have it in celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Pollio</hi>'s Son's Birth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we obſerve the Connexion of one Verſe to another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:55884:91"/>It appears that <hi>Decus-evi,</hi> the Grace, or Glory of that Age, who was to reſtore the Age of Gold, was expected to be born during <hi>Pollio</hi>'s Conſulſhip, that while he was Conſul the Sins of Mankind were to be taken away; nor can any think it ſuppoſed to be done by any other, than by him who is called the great encreaſe of <hi>Jove,</hi> who was to aſcend into Heaven, and to govern the World with his Father's Vertues, which I may well render by <hi>expreſſing his Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Clouds being thus removed, theſe Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars appear with a clear Light.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Cumaean Sybil</hi> ſpake of a Virgin,<note place="margin">Jam redit &amp; Virgo.</note> which might then perhaps be thought meant of <hi>Aſtraea,</hi> becauſe of the glorious things ſaid of her.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there was expected a wonderful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, a Reſtauration, of the ſtate of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, or Golden Age, ſuch as the Poets fancied to have been in <hi>Saturn</hi>'s Reign, and in truth was under the Primitive Theocracy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this was to be at the Birth of a Man-Child, to whom are aſcribed ſuch things as no poetical Licenſe, without warrant from a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or Prediction, could excuſe.</p>
               <p>And tho I may ſeem to ſtrain, where I call him (the Rythm requiring it) Earth's King, nothing leſs can be implied from,

               <p>Could theſe things be with any colour aſcribed to the Son of <hi>Pollio?</hi> Nay: and does he not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him to be more than Man, not only where he ſays,

               <p>But more plainly, where he calls him,
<q>—Magnum Jovis incrementum:</q>
               </p>
               <p>Where the Increaſe of <hi>Jove</hi> ſeems to ſhew, that tho he had an Hypoſtaſis, or Perſonality, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the Great God, yet is one God with him, <hi>Jove</hi> being ſpread out or encreas'd, with another Perſon, but his Godhead undivided.</p>
               <p>With thoſe Divine Myſteries which <hi>Virgil</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports from the <hi>Sybil,</hi> he ſeems to joyn ſome poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Flouriſhes of his own, as that the Earth ſhould pay this Infant an early Tribute of its Stores; that when he grows up the Oak ſhould yeild Honey; and that when he is arrived to Manhood, Nature ſhould die the Flocks with the moſt pleaſing Colours without the help of Art, and the like.</p>
               <p>But I know not but another part, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted of a fancied Platonical Revolution, may have a truly moral Signification.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Pauca tamen ſuberunt veteris veſtigia fraudis,</l>

               <q>Hinc ubi jam firmata virum te fecerit eras.</q>
               <p>Which might be rendred; Till the perfect Age of the Church. And this perhaps a Millena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry would apply, as a Prediction of Chriſt's Reign, at his return to the Earth before the general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</p>
               <p>But waving what may be doutful, or wholly poetical; what has been here ſaid, together with the account how carefully the <hi>Sybils</hi> Prophecies were kept, and examined by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and with the Juſtification of the Primitive Chriſtians in their Appeals to them; may ſatisfy any Man, who impartially conſiders, that <hi>Virgil</hi>'s fourth Eclogue is, in the main, an account of the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maean Sybil</hi>'s Prediction, of ſuch an one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be born about that time, as Chriſtians maintain, and none could ever with any colour deny, the Author of their Faith to have been.</p>
               <p>That this account was wrote before the Birth of our Saviour, can be no queſtion, unleſs we will think that ſome Chriſtian, was not only Poet good enough to counterfeit <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Vein, but had the art to ſlide it in ſo well, and ſo early, that none ſhould be able to diſcover the Cheat, by ſhewing any Copies wherein this was omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And beſides, all this Artifice would have
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:55884:93"/>
been to no purpoſe, unleſs at the ſame time he could have prevailed upon the Keepers of the Sybilline Writings in the Capitol, to let ſome Verſes be foiſted in to countenance the matter.</p>
               <p>For tho this Account was given by <hi>Virgil</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Auguſtus</hi> made his Collection; yet we ſhould have heard of it before now, if there had been nothing in the Capitol to warrant <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>'s Quotations.</p>
               <p>And in truth, the lewd Interpretations which have been put upon this Poem, ſhew, that 'twas thought more eaſy to caſt a blind, by making <hi>Virgil</hi> write with unallowable poetical Licenſe, and without any manner of coherence, than to gain Credit in the denial that this Poem was <hi>Virgil</hi>'s. If they believ'd their own Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; we may well ſay, 'twas becauſe they thought of no Perſon to whom they might apply the Character, which no Man, after reading the Scriptures, and <hi>Grotius,</hi> can deny to belong to our Saviour, and to him only.</p>
