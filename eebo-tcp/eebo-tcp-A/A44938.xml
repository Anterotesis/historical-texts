            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>ſeek him in earneſt?</hi> But ſo we may, and yet in vain, if we ſeek him not in a right order: we know there was a breach of God upon his people once for this, <hi>That they ſought him,</hi>

preſervative to drive away, to keep off infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to reſtore health to the daughter of Gods people, the cure is much in our ſelves, as the cauſe of the diſeaſe is altogether in us.</p>
            <p>Wickedneſs to come to an end? This is not <hi>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquum petere,</hi> but is it not <hi>in auditum petere?</hi> Well might this be the option, the wiſh rather then prayer of <hi>David</hi> the good King; but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of <hi>David</hi> the Prophet ſure it could not be; For to what time could it be calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? or when ſhould theſe things be? Not till there be a new Heaven, and a new Earth, a more pure, holy and happy age then ever yet was, and much leſs is like to be. <hi>Let the wickedneſs of the wicked come</hi> to its heighth, ſo as to reach up to Heaven; let the meaſure of iniquity be filled up, and running over; let the manners of men be ſo ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively and profligately vicious that they cannot be worſe. If the Text had been thus, this age would bid fair for the fulfilling of it, but not otherwiſe; and to any one who will mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the acceptableneſs and energy of a prayer, by the likelihood of its ſucceſs and return, this looks like a prayer quite loſt, and ſounds like that ſtrange Abſolution which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced over a great ſinner, <hi>Deus tui miſereatur ſi vult) &amp; condonet (quod non credo.)</hi> But God forbid we ſhould caſt all thoſe prayers as vain
<pb n="IV" facs="tcp:100964:4"/>
and unacceptable, which do not obtain their expreſſed effect: We pray in our Letany, <hi>That God would have mercy upon all men;</hi> We know he will not, or rather, in honour he cannot; yet it is a very acceptable piety, and duly exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive charity, to pray ſo; For would God have all men to be ſaved, and would not we? Is it a ſcruple to put as many into our prayers, as our Lord Chriſt did own dying for? Or are we afraid, leſt the many prepared manſions in Heaven ſhould be over-filled, though there were as many bleſſed Saints as Men? <hi>My prayer returned into my own boſom,</hi> (ſaid this man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gods heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.13.) ſuch a return and reſerve at leaſt there is of every good mans Prayer, if it obtain no more; I do not ſay, this Prayer here did onely return into <hi>Davids</hi> boſom; I know the contrary, His enemies did feel the force of it.</p>
            <p>And whoſo looks into the occaſion of this Pſalm, and conſiders how it was with this beſt of Kings, and Men, will ſee particular urgent reaſon for this Prayer, <hi>That wickedneſs might come to an end;</hi> For was he not hard beſet with inveterate, irreconcilable Enemies? with falſe, treacherous Friends? Of his Council, of his Houſhold, of his own Loins? Plotters againſt his Perſon? Diſturbers of the peace of his Kingdom? There was no end of the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="V" facs="tcp:100964:4"/>
nor like to be, unleſs the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence would give a ſtrange check and ſtop un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; therefore as if he did point at ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons, (the perpetual thorns in his ſide) at <hi>Achitophel,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Theodoret,</hi> but there is no good <hi>ſynchroniſm</hi> in that) at <hi>Saul,</hi> (ſay <hi>Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> and <hi>Lyranus)</hi> he devotes them to the Juſtice of God, and in their deſtruction aſſures and foretells his own eſtabliſhment: It may be the unhappy Fate of the beſt of Princes, That all the moſt obliging graciouſneſs of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhall not endear him to ungracious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; his Golden Scepter ſhall gain no more to his obedience, then the Iron Rod of a Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per did: Wickedneſs will ſtill have its Attempts, and there is no ſecurity from them;<note place="margin">Iſaiah 7:4:</note> 
               <hi>ſmoaking Firebrands</hi> laid together, will be quickly ready to take fire, and ſet all in combuſtion; but as happy is, the iſſue may help all, <hi>That wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhall come to an end;</hi> it ſhall be taken off, and ſhall not be able to hinder the eſtabliſhment of his Throne; and that it may be ſo, prayer muſt be made to the righteous Puniſher or Reſtrainer of the wicked, and eſtabliſher of the juſt, <hi>O let the wickedneſs of the wicked come to an end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what? do we find <hi>David</hi> here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly curſing his Enemies on his knees? —<hi>Tantaene animis Coeleſtibus Irae? Conſumet nunc malum impios,</hi> ſo the Interlinear. He wiſhes a

preſent Conſumption upon them, deſtruction upon them, (as the <hi>Chaldee)</hi> They who thus underſtand him, do ſuppoſe his aim to be onely at the more malicious, implacable Enemies of Gods Kingdom, and his, according to that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſage of his,<note place="margin">Pſal. 59 5.</note> 
               <hi>Be not merciful, O God, unto them who offend of malicious wickedneſs,</hi> (to men of <hi>Saul's</hi> ſpirit.) But you may alſo (if you pleaſe) find ſome charity and tenderneſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing through all that anger; for as elſewhere he ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.6. <hi>I will pray yet againſt their wickedneſs, or againſt their miſchiefs, not againſt their perſons;</hi> ſo here he doth no more: It is (if you obſerve) <hi>deſtructur malitia,</hi> not let them, but let their wickedneſs be deſtroy'd, and come to an end; and to confirm this, when <hi>David</hi> ſeem'd moſt exaſperated, ſo that he could not contain from a <hi>Confundantur, Let them be confounded;</hi> yet he did not curſe, but bleſs the men, even in that, as he interprets himſelf, <hi>Confound them</hi> (that is) <hi>in their imaginations;</hi> and Pſal. 83.16. <hi>Let their faces be filled with ſhame,</hi> but <hi>eo conſilio, that they may ſeek thy Name;</hi> as if he did ſtrike pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely at their wickedneſs, and yet would ſave their perſons if he could: And the charitable gloſs which Sr. <hi>Baſil</hi> puts upon this prayer of his, is, That they may repent of their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and be reclaimed, and not infect others. But how St. <hi>Auſtin, Jerom,</hi> and ſome others
<pb n="VII" facs="tcp:100964:5"/>
with them, <hi>primae Cerae,</hi> could think that <hi>David</hi> here look't as far as to the <hi>Jews,</hi> Crucifiers of Chriſt, praying, That they might accompliſh their wickedneſs, and ſo haſten the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the redemption of Mankind, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I am too purblind to ſee ſo far off: Well, in praying, <hi>O let the wickedneſs of the wicked come to an end.</hi> 1. This ſuppoſition is clear:</p>
            <p>Wickedneſs (if let alone) will be intermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and Infinite; there will be no end of the provocation, nor of the miſchief of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Upon this the Inference will be ſtrongly inforced, In Policy as well as in Piety; it ſhould not be let alone, but provided againſt, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt.</p>
            <p>You have heard it often ſaid by Divines, That every ungodly perſon ſins <hi>in eterno ſuo;</hi> the paſſage was St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s, <hi>Juſtum ut qui in ſuo eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no peccavit contra Deum, in Dei eterno puniatur:</hi> If the man we ſpeak of, might live ſo long as his wickedneſs would live, and be continued, it would be to the days of Eternity; for ſo ſaith he again, <hi>Iniqui voluiſſent ſine fine vivere, ut ſine fine potuiſſent in iniquitatibus permanere: O God</hi> (cries out our holy Pſalmiſt) <hi>ſhall the Enemy blaſpheme thy Name for ever!</hi> for ever and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more; or for ever and yet (for ſo the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> loves to exaggerate) as if it would <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

that he implies, <hi>Let them alone, and they will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly blaſpheme thy Name for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Maſters in the <hi>Metaphyſicks</hi> do eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, <hi>Non dari actu Infinitum,</hi> That God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf cannot make another Infinite; but if ſin could be fitted with a ſubject to perpetuate it ſelf in, it would prove the contrary; nay it doth alſo (it is no Paradox) prove an actual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity; For, when doth this leave a man? when it hath corrupted and worn out his miſerable body, and brought him to the grave? Is this the laſt miſchief of it? Alas no, the bad works as well as the good, do follow men into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world; the ſin is as immortal as the ſoul which it hath polluted; and what but that in the guilty Conſcience, becomes the gnawing worm that never dyes? As the torments of the damned can be no other then eternal, ſo are their ſins alſo; they can no more ceaſe to ſin, then to ſuffer; <hi>Culpa quae eſt irreparabilis de ſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet quod perpetuo duret, &amp; ideo ei debetur paena eterna,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Aquinas.</hi>)</p>
            <p>The petulant and ever-importunate nature of ſin, how far it would be from giving over, and <hi>coming to an end,</hi> the daily practice of men gives Demonſtration enough.
