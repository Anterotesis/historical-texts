            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO The Right Honourable, JAMES, EARL of <hi>SALISBVRY,</hi> VISCOUNT <hi>CRAMBORN,</hi> AND BARON of <hi>ISLINGTON.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHO should one celibrate with Verse and Song, but the Great, the Noble and the Brave? where dedicate an <hi>Isle of Love,</hi> but to the Gay, the Soft and Young? and who amongst Men can lay a better claim to these
<pb facs="tcp:48339:3"/>
than Your Lordship? who like the Sun new risen with the early Day, looks round the World and sees nothing it cannot claim an interest in (for what cannot Wit, Beauty, Wealth and Honour claim?) The violent storms of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Rebellion are hush'd and calm'd; black Treason is retir'd to its old abode, the dark Abyss of Hell; the mysterious Riddles of Politick Knaves and Fools, which so long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mused and troubled the World's repose, are luckily <unclear>unfolded</unclear>; and Your Lordship is salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at Your first coming forth, Your first set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out for the glorious and happy Race of Life, by a Nation all glad, gay and smiling; and you have nothing before you but a ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing prospect of eternal Ioys, and everlasting inviting Pleasures, and all that Love and Fortune can bestow on their darling Youth, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend You in the noble persuit; and nothing can prevent Your being the most happy of her Favourites, but a too eager slight, a two swift speed o'er the charming slowry Meads and Plains that lie in view, between Your setting out and the end of Your glorious Chase. A long and illustrious race of Nobility has attended
<pb facs="tcp:48339:3"/>
Your great Name, but none I believe ever came into the World with Your Lordship's advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; amongst which, my Lord, 'tis not the least that You have the glory to be truly Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and to be adorn'd with those excellent Principles, which render Nobility so absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worth the Veneration which is paid 'em; 'tis those, my Lord, and not the Title that make it truly great: Grandeur in any other serves but to point 'em out more particularly to the World, and shew their Faults with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter magnitude, and render 'em more liable to contempt and that Reward which justly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues Ingratitude; nor is it, my Lord, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unhappy Examples this Age has produc'd that has deter'd you from herding with the busie Vnfortunates, and bringing Your power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full aid to their detestable cause, but a noble Honesty in Your Nature, a Genorosity in Your Soul. That even part of Your Education had the good fortune not to be able to corrupt; no Opinion cou'd byass You, no Precedent debauch You; though all the fansied Glories of Power were promis'd You, though all the Contempt thrown on good and brave Men, all the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
<pb facs="tcp:48339:4"/>
Arguments of the old Serpent, were us'd against the best of Kings and his illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious Successour, still You were unmov'd; Your young stout Heart with a Gallantry and Force unusual resisted and defied the gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Bait, laugh'd at the industrious Politicks of the busie Wise, and stubbornly Loyal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd the Counsels of the Grave. Go on, my Lord, advance in Noble resolution, grow up in strength of Loyalty, settle it about Your Soul, root it there like the first Principles of Religion, which nothing ever throughly defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and which in spight of even Reason the Soul retains, whatever little Debaucheries the Tongue may commit; You that are great, are born the Bulwarks of sacred Majesty, its defence against all the storms of Fate, the Safety of the People in the Supporters of the Throne; and sure none that ever obey'd the Laws of God and the Dictates of Honour ever paid those Duties to a Sovereign that more truly merited the Defence and Adorations of his People than this of ours; and tis a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing (since we are oblig'd to render it to the worst of Tyrant Kings) that we have one
<pb facs="tcp:48339:4"/>
who so well justifies that intire Love and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission we ought to pay him. You, my Lord, are one whom Thousands of good Men look up to with wondrous Veneration and Ioy, when 'tis said Your Lordship amongst Your other Vertues is Loyal too, a true Tory! (a word of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour now, the Royal Cause has sanctified it,) and though Your Lordship needs no encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to a good that rewards it self, yet I am confident You are not onely rank'd in the esteem of the best of Monarchs, but we shall behold you as one of our Preservers, and all <hi>England</hi> as one of its great Patrons, when Ages that shall come shall find Your noble Name inroll'd amongst the Friends to Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy in an Age of so villainous Corruption: Yes, my Lord, they will find it there and bless You. 'Tis this, my Lord, with every other Grace and Noble Vertue that adorns You, and gives the World such promises of Wonders in You, that makes me ambitious to be the first in the Croud of Your Admirers, that shall have the honour to celibrate Your great Name. Be pleased then, my Lord, to accept this Little Piece, which lazy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
<pb facs="tcp:48339:5"/>
begot and hard Fate has oblig'd me to bring forth into the censuring World, to which if any thing can reconcile it, 'twill be the glory it has to bear Your Noble Name in the front, and to be Patronized by so great and good a Man: Permit but my Zeal for Your Lordship to attone for the rest of my Faults, and Your Lordship will extremely oblige,</p>

            <l>Thy tender notions in loose numbers slow,</l>
            <l>With a strange power to charm where e'er they go:</l>

                  <head>THE ARGUMENT.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hecuba,</hi> being with Child of <hi>Paris,</hi> dream'd she was delivered of a Firebrand: <hi>Priam,</hi> consulting the Prophets, was answer'd the Child shou'd be the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of <hi>Troy,</hi> wherefore <hi>Priam</hi> commanded it should be deliver'd to wild Beasts as soon as born; but <hi>Hecuba</hi> conveys it secretly to Mount <hi>Ida,</hi> there to be foster'd by the Shepherds, where he falls in love with the Nymph <hi>OEnone,</hi> but at last being known and own'd, he sails into <hi>Greece,</hi> and carries <hi>Helen</hi> to <hi>Troy,</hi> which <hi>OEnone</hi> understanding, writes him this Epistle.</p>
               </argument>
               <l>TO thee, dear <hi>Paris,</hi> Lord of my Desires,</l>
               <l>Once tender Partner of my softest Fires;</l>
               <l>To thee I write, mine, while a Shepherd's Swain,</l>
               <l>But now a Prince, that Title you disdain.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:48339:82"/>Oh fatal Pomp, that cou'd so soon divide</l>
               <l>What Love, and all our sacred Vows had ty'd!</l>
               <l>What God, our Love industrious to prevent,</l>
               <l>Curst thee with power, and ruin'd my Content?</l>
               <l>Greatness, which does at best but ill agree</l>
               <l>With Love, such Distance sets 'twixt Thee and Me.</l>
               <l>Whilst thou a Prince, and I a Shepherdess,</l>
               <l>My raging Passion can have no redress.</l>
               <l>Wou'd God, when first I saw thee, thou hadst been</l>
               <l>This Great, this Cruel, Celebrated thing.</l>
               <l>That without hope I might have gaz'd and bow'd,</l>
               <l>And mixt my Adorations with the Crowd;</l>
               <l>Unwounded then I had escap'd those Eyes,</l>
               <l>Those lovely Authors of my Miseries.</l>
               <l>Not that less Charms their fatal pow'r had drest,</l>
               <l>But Fear and Awe my Love had then supprest:</l>
               <l>My unambitious Heart no Flame had known,</l>
               <l>But what Devotion pays to Gods alone.</l>
               <l>I might have wondr'd, and have wisht that He,</l>
               <l>Whom Heaven shou'd make me love, might look like Thee.</l>
               <l>More in a silly Nymph had been a sin,</l>
               <l>This had the height of my Presumption been.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:48339:82"/>But thou a Flock didst feed on <hi>Ida</hi>'s Plain,</l>
               <l>And hadst no Title, but <hi>The lovely Swain.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>A Title! which more Virgin Hearts has won,</l>
               <l>Than that of being own'd King <hi>Priam</hi>'s Son.</l>
               <l>Whilst me a harmless Neighbouring Cotager</l>
               <l>You saw, and did above the rest prefer.</l>
               <l>You saw! and at first sight you lov'd me too,</l>
               <l>Nor cou'd I hide the wounds receiv'd from you.</l>
               <l>Me all the Village Herdsmen strove to gain,</l>
               <l>For me the Shepherds sigh'd and su'd in vain,</l>
               <l>Thou hadst my heart, and they my cold disdain.</l>
               <l>Not all their Offerings, Garlands, and first born</l>
               <l>Of their lov'd Ewes, cou'd bribe my Native scorn.</l>
               <l>My Love, like hidden Treasure long conceal'd,</l>
               <l>Cou'd onely where 'twas destin'd, be reveal'd.</l>
               <l>And yet how long my Maiden blushes strove</l>
               <l>Not to betray my easie new-born Love.</l>
               <l>But at thy sight the kindling Fire wou'd rise,</l>
               <l>And I, unskill'd, declare it at my Eyes.</l>
               <l>But oh the Joy! the mighty Ecstasie</l>
               <l>Possest thy Soul at this Discovery.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:48339:83"/>Speechless, and panting at my feet you lay,</l>
               <l>And short breath'd Sighs told what you cou'd not say.</l>
               <l>A thousand times my hand with Kisses prest,</l>
               <l>And look'd such Darts, as none cou'd e'er resist.</l>
               <l>Silent we gaz'd, and as my Eyes met thine,</l>
               <l>New Joy fill'd theirs, new Love and shame fill'd mine!</l>
               <l>You saw the Fears my kind disorder show'd</l>
               <l>And breaking Silence Faith anew you vow'd!</l>
               <l>Heavens, how you swore by every Pow'r Divine</l>
               <l>You wou'd be ever true! be ever mine!</l>
               <l>Each God, a sacred witness you invoke,</l>
               <l>And wish'd their Curse when e'er these Vows you broke.</l>
               <l>Quick to my Heart each perjur'd Accent ran,</l>
               <l>Which I took in, believ'd, and was undone.</l>
               <l>" Vows are Love's poyson'd Arrows, and the heart</l>
               <l>So wounded, rarely finds a Cure from Art.</l>
               <l>At least this heart which Fate has destin'd yours,</l>
               <l>This heart unpractis'd in Love's mystick pow'rs,</l>
               <l>For I am soft and young as <hi>April</hi> Flowers.</l>
               <l>Now uncontroll'd we meet, uncheck'd improve</l>
               <l>Each happier Minute in new Joys of Love!</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:48339:83"/>Soft were our hours! and lavishly the Day</l>
               <l>We gave intirely up to Love, and Play.</l>
               <l>Oft to the cooling Groves our Flocks we led,</l>
               <l>And seated on some shaded, flowery Bed,</l>
               <l>Watch'd the united Wantons as they fed.</l>
               <l>And all the Day my list'ning Soul I hung</l>
               <l>Upon the charming Musick of thy Tongue,</l>
               <l>And never thought the blessed hours too long.</l>
               <l>No Swain, no God like thee cou'd ever move,</l>
               <l>Or had so soft an Art in whisp'ring Love,</l>
               <l>No wonder for thou art Ally'd to <hi>Iove!</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And when you pip'd, or sung, or danc'd, or spoke,</l>
               <l>The God appear'd in every Grace, and Look.</l>
               <l>Pride of the Swains, and Glory of the Shades,</l>
               <l>The Grief, and Joy of all the Love-sick Maids.</l>
               <l>Thus whilst all hearts you rul'd without Controul,</l>
               <l>I reign'd the absolute Monarch of your Soul.</l>
               <l>Each Beach my Name yet bears, carv'd out by thee,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Paris,</hi> and his <hi>OEnone</hi> fill each Tree;</l>
               <l>And as they grow, the Letters larger spread,</l>
               <l>Grow still a witness of my Wrongs when dead!</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:48339:84"/>Close by a silent silver Brook there grows</l>
               <l>A Poplar, under whose dear gloomy Boughs</l>
               <l>A thousand times we have exchang'd our Vows!</l>
               <l>Oh may'st thou grow! t' an endless date of Years!</l>
               <l>Who on thy Bark this fatal Record bears;</l>

               <l>The perjur'd Swain from all his Faith is gone!</l>
               <l>Curst be that day, may Fate appoint the hour,</l>
               <l>As Ominous in his black Kalendar;</l>

               <l>Naked they came, no Veil their Beauty shrouds;</l>
               <l>But every Charm, and Grace expos'd to view,</l>
               <l>Left Heav'n to be survey'd, and judg'd by you.</l>
               <l>To bribe thy voice <hi>Iuno</hi> wou'd Crowns bestow,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Pallas</hi> more gratefully wou'd dress thy Brow</l>
               <l>With Wreaths of Wit! <hi>Venus</hi> propos'd the choice</l>
               <l>Of all the fairest <hi>Greeks!</hi> and had thy Voice.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:48339:84"/>Crowns, and more glorious Wreaths thou didst despise,</l>
               <l>And promis'd Beauty more than Empire prize!</l>
               <l>This when you told, Gods! what a killing fear</l>
               <l>Did over all my shivering Limbs appear?</l>

               <l>The Blushes left my Cheeks, from every part</l>
               <l>The Bloud ran swift to guard my fainting heart.</l>
               <l>You in my Eyes the glimmering Light perceiv'd</l>
               <l>Of parting Life, and on my pale Lips breath'd</l>
               <l>Such Vows, as all my Terrors undeceiv'd.</l>
               <l>But soon the envying Gods disturb'd our Joy,</l>

               <l>Heavens! how you look'd! and what a Godlike Grace</l>
               <l>At their first Homage beautify'd your Face!</l>
               <l>Yet this no Wonder, or Amazement brought,</l>

               <l>You kist the Tears which down my Cheeks did glide,</l>
               <l>And mingled yours with the soft falling Tide,</l>

                  <l>—Thence to a silent <hi>Desert</hi> I advance,</l>
                  <l>And call'd the <hi>Desert of Remembrance</hi>;</l>
                  <l>A solitude upon a Mountain plac'd,</l>
                  <l>All gloomy round, and wonderous high and vast,</l>
                  <l>From whence <hi>Love</hi>'s Island all appears in view,</l>
                  <l>And distant Prospects renders near and true;</l>
