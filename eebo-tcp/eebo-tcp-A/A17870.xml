            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AMongst the diuers reportes of the behavior of M Campion, M. Sherwin, &amp; M Brya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at their death (passing among freindes from hand to hand) I hapned vpon one ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ven out as it seemeth by a Catholike priest, who as it apereth pressed to ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>serue &amp; marke those dealings: which report I have here published, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the divers &amp; many slaunders rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed since by some maliciously blinded to satisfie &amp; content all such as do desire to vnderstand the manner of the same: I hope that consideration which hath movid me hereto, wil al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so perswade that priest to the wel li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this my doing? &amp; I dout not but that the relation it self will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the reader throughly touching their words, and behaviour at the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of execution, Notwithstanding those slaunders which were since sp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to diminish the honour of their refolute departure &amp; Martirdome, as that M Campion was timerous and fearfull, &amp; that M Sherwin died a

protestant, with other such false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes, as thov shalt see in pervsing this short relation here exhibitid for thy satisfaction: wherin is a lively I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of resolute martirs, constantly professing their faith &amp; belief, resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly disclaming from all treasons and treacheryes falslie intendid againste them: and loyaly behaving them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues towards our queene &amp; country. Who as they were in their lives lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of piety &amp; vertue, so in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athes made themselves paternes and examples for all good christian sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes to follow.</p>
            <p>And here by the way I might point out M. Elmers folly, as not one of the least, who notwithstanding the kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen lerning of M.

Tower. Further that al the Papistes in the worlde coulde not answere Whitakers booke against the saide M Campion. Which his censure, I referre vnto the iudgement of the lerned discret and wise, who I know do condemne the babbling of that barren declaymer, as voyde of witte, discretion, lerning, modestie, &amp; truth. But howe friuolous and vayne these slaunders are, although the whole world (filled nowe with the fame of his lerning) doth know, yet it shal be made more manifest and apparant euen vnto him selfe by those Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations had in the Tower, to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of M Campion and furthering of his cause, at suche time as by the grace of God they shal be published. This rehearsal (good Reader) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse is impertinent to the purposse of that Preist who gaue out the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port folowing, and yet I thought it not altogether amisse to touch those slaunders so false and malicious, as many good Gentlemen can not but confesse. Muche more M Elmer spake that day, as he thought, to the
<pb facs="tcp:7822:4"/>
discredite of M. Campion, but I pray God giue him better consideration both of this and of further iustice, and so shall the poore Poulter at his nexte complaynt be heard, euen of himself, beeing as he himself said, a Bishop, a Lorde, and of some credite Farewell.</p>
