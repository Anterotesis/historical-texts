            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

PROPOSAL
About Printing a TREATISE of
ALGEBRA,
HISTORICAL and PRACTICAL:
Written by the Reverend and Learned Dr. John Wallis (Savilian
Professor of Geometry in the University of Oxford), con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
not only a History, but an Institution of ALGEBRA,
according to several Methods hitherto in practice; with many
Additions of his own.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T contains an Account of the Original, Progress,
and Advancement of (what we now call) <hi>Algebra,</hi>
from time to time, and by what steps it hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to that height at which now it is.</p>
            <p>Asserting, That it was in use of old among the
<hi>Grecians;</hi> but studiously concealed as a great Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.</p>
            <p>Examples we have of it in <hi>Euclid,</hi> at lest in
<hi>Theon,</hi> upon him; who ascribes the invention of it
(amongst them) to <hi>Plato.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Other Examples we have of it in <hi>Pappus,</hi> and
the effects of it in <hi>Archimedes, Apollonius,</hi> and others, though obscurely cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and disguised.</p>
            <p>But we have no professed Treatise of it (among them) ancienter than that
of <hi>Diophantus,</hi> first published (in <hi>Latin</hi>) by <hi>Xylander,</hi> and since (in <hi>Greek</hi> and
<hi>Latin</hi>) by <hi>Bachetus,</hi> with divers Additions of his own; and reprinted lately
with Additions of Monsieur <hi>Fermat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it was of ancient use among the <hi>Arabs</hi> (and perhaps sooner than
amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi>), which they are supposed to have received from the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi>
and these from the <hi>Indians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the <hi>Arabs</hi> (by means of the <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi>) it was brought into
<hi>Spain,</hi> and thence into <hi>England</hi> (together with the use of the Numeral Figures,
and other Parts of <hi>Mathematical</hi> Learning, and particularly the <hi>Astronomical</hi>),
before <hi>Diophantus</hi> seems to have been known amongst us. And from those we
have the name of <hi>Algebra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed most of the <hi>Greek</hi> Learning came to us the same way, the first
Translations of <hi>Euclid, Ptolomy,</hi> and others, into <hi>Latin,</hi> being from the <hi>Arabic</hi>
Copies, and not from the <hi>Greek</hi> Originals.</p>
            <p>That the use of the <hi>Numeral</hi> Figures (which the <hi>Greeks</hi> had not) was a great
advantage to the improvement of <hi>Algebra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Figures seem to have come in use in these Parts about the middle of the
Eleventh Century (about the year 1050), though some others think not 'till
about 200 years after, and it seems they did scarce come to be of common
use 'till about that time.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sexagesimal</hi> Fractions (introduced it seems by <hi>Ptolomy</hi>) did but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
supply the want of such a Method of Numeral Figures.</p>
            <p>The use of Numeral Figures have received two great Improvements, The
one is that of Decimal Parts, which seems to have been introduced (silently
<pb facs="tcp:34406:2"/>
and unobserved) by <hi>Regiomontanus,</hi> in his Trigonometrical Canons, about the
year 1450, but much advanced in the last and present Century, by <hi>Simon Stevin</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Briggs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And this is much to be preferred before <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Sexagesimal way, as is
shewed by the comparative use of both.</p>
            <p>The other Improvement is that of <hi>Logarithms,</hi> which is of great use in <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical</hi>
and other <hi>Trigonometrical</hi> Calculations, introduced by the Lord <hi>Neper,</hi> and
perfected by Mr. <hi>Briggs</hi> (about the beginning of this Century). The ground
and practice of which is here declared.</p>
            <p>And these things, though they be not properly Parts of <hi>Algebra,</hi> are yet of
great advantage in the practise of it.</p>
            <p>The first printed Author which treats of <hi>Algebra</hi> is <hi>Lucas Pacciolus,</hi> or <hi>Lucas
de Burgo</hi> a Minorite Fryer, of whom we have a Treatise in <hi>Italian,</hi> printed at
<hi>Venice</hi> in the year 1494, (soon after the first Invention of Printing.)</p>
            <p>But he therein mentions <hi>Leonardus Pisanus,</hi> and divers others more ancient
than himself, from whom he learned it, but whose Works are not now extant.</p>
            <p>This Fryar <hi>Lucas,</hi> in his <hi>Summa Arithmetica &amp; Geometrica,</hi> (for he hath other
Works extant) hath a very full Treatise of <hi>Arithmetic</hi> in all the Parts of it;
in <hi>Integers, Fractions, Surds, Binomials;</hi> Extraction of <hi>Roots, Quadratic, Cubic,</hi> &amp;c.
and the several Rules of <hi>Proportion, Fellowship,</hi> about <hi>Accompts, Alligation, False
Position;</hi> and of <hi>Algebra,</hi> with the Appurtenances thereunto, as far as <hi>Quadratic
Equations</hi> reach, but no farther: And this he tells us was derived from the <hi>Arabs,</hi>
(to whom we are beholding for this kind of Learning,) without taking notice
of <hi>Diophantus</hi> (or other <hi>Greek</hi> Authors), who it seems was not known here in
those days.</p>
            <p>After him followed <hi>Stiphelius</hi> (a good Author), and others by him cited,
who also proceed no farther than <hi>Quadratic</hi> Equations.</p>
            <p>Afterwards <hi>Scipio Ferreus, Cardan, Tartalea,</hi> and others, proceeded to the Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of (some) <hi>Cubic</hi> Equations.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Bombelli</hi> goes yet farther, and shews how to reduce a <hi>Biquadratic</hi> Equation
(by the help of a <hi>Cubic</hi>) to two <hi>Quadratics.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Nonnius</hi> (or <hi>Nunnez,</hi> in <hi>Spanish) Ramus, Schonerus, Salignacus, Clavius,</hi> and
others, (in the last Century) pursued the same Subject, in different ways; but
(for the most part) proceed no farther than <hi>Quadratic</hi> Equations.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Diophantus,</hi> first by <hi>Xylander</hi> (in <hi>Latin</hi>), and afterwards
by <hi>Bachetus</hi> was made public, whose Method differs much from that of the <hi>Arabs</hi>
(whom those others followed), and particularly in the order of denominating
the Powers; as taking no notice of <hi>Sursolids,</hi> but using only the names of <hi>Square</hi>
and <hi>Cube,</hi> with the Compounds of these.</p>
            <p>And hitherto no other than the unknown Quantities were wont to be denoted
in <hi>Algebra</hi> by particular Notes or Symbols, but the known Quantities by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Numeral Figures.</p>
            <p>The next great step, for the improvement of <hi>Algebra,</hi> was that of <hi>Specious
Arithmetic,</hi> first introduced by <hi>Vieta</hi> about the year 1590.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Specious Arithmetic,</hi> which gives Notes or <hi>Symbols</hi> (which he calls <hi>Species</hi>)
to Quantities both known and unknown, furnisheth us with a short and convenient
way of Notation; whereby the whole process of many Operations is at once
exposed to the Eye in a short Synopsis.</p>
            <p>By help of this he makes many Discoveries, in the process of <hi>Algebra,</hi> not
before taken notice of.</p>
            <p>And he introduceth his Numeral <hi>Exegesis,</hi> of affected Equations, extracting
the Roots of these in Numbers. Which had before been applied to single
Equations, such as the extracting the Roots of <hi>Squares, Cubes, &amp;c.</hi> singly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed;
but had not been applied to Equations affected. And in the Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Powers, he follows the order of <hi>Diophantus,</hi> not that derived from the
<hi>Arabs,</hi> which others had before used.</p>
            <p>The method of <hi>Vieta</hi> is followed and much improved by Mr. <hi>Oughtred</hi> in his
<hi>Clavis</hi> (first published in the year 1631) and other Treatises of his; and it doth
in a brief compendious method declare in short what had before been the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of large Volumes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:34406:2"/>
And for this reason, here is a pretty full account of his Method inserted, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with an Institution for the practice of <hi>Algebra</hi> according thereunto; and
though much of it had been before taught in the Authors above-mentioned, yet
this was thought the most proper place to insert such an Institution, because by
him delivered in the most compendious form.</p>
            <p>And in pursuance of his Method, and as an Exemplification thereof, there is
here inserted a Discourse of <hi>Angular Sections,</hi> and several things thereon depending.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Harriot</hi> was contemporary with Mr. <hi>Oughtred,</hi> but died before him, and
left many good things behind him in writing, of which there is nothing hitherto
made public, but only his <hi>Algebra</hi> or <hi>Analytice,</hi> which was published by Mr. <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
soon after that of Mr. <hi>Oughtred,</hi> in the same year 1631.</p>
            <p>He alters the way of Notation, used by <hi>Vieta</hi> and <hi>Oughtred,</hi> for another more
convenient.</p>
            <p>And he hath also made a strange improvement of <hi>Algebra,</hi> by discovering the
true construction of <hi>Compound Equations,</hi> and how they be raised by a Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of <hi>Simple Equations,</hi> and may therefore be resolved into such.</p>
            <p>By this means he shews the number of Roots (real or imaginary) in every
Equation, and the Ingredients of all the Coefficients, in each degree of Affection.</p>
            <p>He shews also how to increase or diminish the <hi>Roots,</hi> yet unknown by any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
or in any Proportion assigned; to destroy some of the intermediate Terms,
to turn Negative Roots into Affirmative, or these into those; with many other
things very advantagious in the practice of <hi>Algebra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In sum, He hath taught (in a manner) all that which hath since passed for
the <hi>Cartesian</hi> method of <hi>Algebra,</hi> there being scarce any thing of (pure) <hi>Algebra</hi>
in <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> which was not before in <hi>Harriot,</hi> from whom <hi>Des Cartes</hi> seems to
have taken what he hath, that is purely <hi>Algebra,</hi> but without naming him.</p>
            <p>But the Application thereof to <hi>Geometry,</hi> or other particular Subjects, is not
the business of that Treatise, (but what he hath handled in other Writings of
his, which have not yet the good hap to be made public;) the design of this
being purely <hi>Algebra,</hi> abstract for particular Subjects.</p>
            <p>Of this Treatise here is the fuller account inserted, because the Book it self
hath been but little known abroad; that it may hence appear to what estate
<hi>Harriot</hi> had brought <hi>Algebra</hi> before his death.</p>
            <p>After this follows an account of Dr. <hi>Pell</hi>'s Method, who hath a particular way
of Notation, by keeping a Register (in the Margin) of the several steps in his
Demonstrations, with References from one to another.</p>
            <p>Of this, some Examples are here inserted of his own, and others in imitation
thereof; with intimation how that innumerable Solutions of undetermined Cases
are by his method easily discoverable, where great Mathematicians have thought
it a great work to find out some one.</p>
            <p>On this occasion there is a farther Discourse of <hi>Vndetermined Questions,</hi> and
the Limitation of them, and particularly of the Rule of <hi>Alligation,</hi> and of
(what they call) <hi>Geometrical Places,</hi> which are of a like nature, and but the
<hi>Geometrical</hi> Construction of (some of) these Undetermined Questions.</p>
            <p>After this is a Discourse of <hi>Negative Squares,</hi> and the Roots of them, on
which depend (what they call) <hi>imaginary Roots</hi> of impossible Equations, shewing
what is the true Import thereof in nature, with divers Geometrical Constructions
suiting thereunto.</p>
            <p>Then follows a Discourse of the Method of <hi>Exhaustions</hi> (used by Ancients
and Moderns), with the foundation of it.</p>
            <p>And in pursuance thereof, the <hi>Geometrica Indivisibilium</hi> of <hi>Cavalerius,</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the true import thereof, and its agreement with the Ancients Method of
Exhaustions, as being but a compendious Expression thereof, and grounded
thereupon.</p>
            <p>Consequent to this, is the <hi>Arithmetica Infinitorum,</hi> which depends also on the
method of Exhaustions; taking that to be equal, which is proved to differ by
less than any assignable Quantity.</p>
            <p>And lastly, the method of infinite <hi>Series,</hi> or continual <hi>Approximations,</hi> (groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on the same Principles) arising principally from <hi>Divisions</hi> and Extraction of
<hi>Roots,</hi> in <hi>Species,</hi> infinitely continued; invented by Mr. <hi>Isaac Newton,</hi> and pursued
<pb facs="tcp:34406:3"/>
by Mr. <hi>Nicholas Mercator,</hi> and others, which is of great use for the rectifying of
<hi>Curve Lines,</hi> squaring of <hi>Curve-lined Figures,</hi> and other abstruse Difficulties in
<hi>Geometry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Several other Discourses are in several places inserted; as, Of <hi>Aliquote Parts,</hi>
and other Questions depending thereon; and divers other particulars, which
will be seen in the Work it self.</p>
            <p>The whole being written in <hi>English,</hi> is submitted to the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> to be
printed or otherwise disposed of as they please; and if printed, will contain
(as is supposed) about three or four Quires of Paper.</p>

               <head>PROPOSAL.</head>
               <p>THE Council of the <hi>Royal Society</hi> have approved this Treatise, and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the Bookseller to print it, have agreed to give Security to take
off 60 Books in Quires as soon as printed at Three Half-pence each Sheet, and
as much each print of a Plate of Schemes; and seeing such a Subscription is not
sufficient to incite an Undertaker, others that are desirous to promote this kind
of Learning, (which contains the very Kernel of the <hi>Mathematics</hi> in it) are desired
to encourage the Bookseller to proceed, by subscribing to take off a Book or more
at the Rates aforesaid, paying or advancing towards each Book Five Shillings
in hand.</p>
               <p>RICHARD DAVIS, Bookseller in the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
the Printing the abovesaid Treatise, doth propose,</p>
               <p>1. That he will begin printing the same by or before the First day of <hi>August</hi>
next, 1683. and print constantly two Sheets every Week 'till the whole be finished, which
is the greatest Expedition can be made in a Work of this Nature.</p>
               <p>2. That the said Book shall be printed on the same Paper, and with the same Letter,
as this Sheet of Proposals.</p>
               <p>3. He is willing to accept of all Subscribers, that will pay in their five Shillings in
part for each Book (after the Rate above-mention'd) betwixt this and the first of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,
1683;</hi> assuring all Men, that whatsoever Subscriptions shall be tender'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
will not be accepted under four Shillings above the Rate of Three Half-pence <hi>per</hi>
Sheet for every Book; and that no Subscriptions will be taken after the first of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi>
following.</p>
               <p>4. That the said Book shall be ready to be delivered to each Subscriber (by the
Person to whom they subscribe) by St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Day, 1684. each Person paying upon
the Delivery of every Book what it shall amount to more than five Shillings paid at sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
after the Rate abovesaid.</p>
               <p>For the Ease of the Subscribers, they may pay in their Money either to <hi>Richard
Davis</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> or to any of the Booksellers under-named, from whom they shall
receive Acquittances under the Hand and Seal of <hi>Richard Davis</hi> aforesaid, and this
Sheet <hi>gratis</hi> to any one that desires it.</p>
