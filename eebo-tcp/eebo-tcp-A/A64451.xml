            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This young man of whom I am speaking, was one of the first (with some others) who came to the City of <hi>London,</hi> where he met with no small opposition both from professors of divers forms, and also prophane, who heeded no Religion at all, and the way of Truth seemed contemptible, and without form or comeliness to them all, which made the opposition so great, and the labour so hard, that notwithstanding it pleased the Lord to reach unto the Consciences of many, and many were prickt to the heart, so that they cried out, <hi>what shall we do to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi> And God made his Ministry very effectual to the conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of many in the City of <hi>London,</hi> whereby a great change was wrought in the hearts of many, &amp; many hundreds brought to know the Lord their Teacher, which are as seals unto the Word of Life through him unto this day. And many hundreds, I may say thousands, heard the lively Word of God declared by him, and were convinced of the way of Truth, though still remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the disobedience to that of God in their own hearts unto which he declared; and many have lost their day which they had of hearing and receiving the things of God; for now he is taken away which might have been a help unto them while they had time; and all such are not worthy of him. He continued in this City very much at time and times, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102563:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
eight and nine years together, preaching the Word of God, and speaking of the things of his Kingdom to all that looked after it; and great watching, travel, and exercise in the Work of the Lord; and his earnest desire was, That all might have come to know God's salvation, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of their souls. And his great diligence was known unto many, that his only rejoicing was in the prosperity of the Work of the Lord, and the encrease of Faith amongst them that did believe; And his heart was much drawn towards this City; and often times hath he said to me when suffering did come for the Gospel sake, which he knew would come, <hi>I can freely go to that City, and lay down my Life for a Testimony of that Truth which I have declared through the Power and Spirit of God</hi>: Which in the end indeed came to be his share, and will for ever be his Crown, who loved not his life unto death for the Testimony of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>And in the same year 1662. being pressed in his spirit to go visit them who were begotten unto the Faith of God's Elect at the City of <hi>Bristol,</hi> and in divers other Counties, at divers Meetings, and divers particular Friends, he took his leave of them, saying unto very many, That he did not know he should see their faces any more; exhorting them all to faithfulness and stedfastness in that wherein they had found rest for their souls: And said to some, <hi>I am going up to the City of</hi> London <hi>again, to lay down my Life for the Gospel, and suffer amongst Friends in that place,</hi> as having some sence of his suffering before.</p>
            <p>And a little after his return to the City, at a publike Meeting which the people of the Lord have kept these ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, to hear and speak of the things of God to edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at the Bull and and Mouth near <hi>Aldersgate,</hi> by certain Souldiers under the command of <hi>Richard Brown</hi> then General of the City of <hi>London,</hi> he was violently plucked down, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led away in a barbarous manner, and carryed to the guard, and so committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> not for evil-doing, but for testifying unto the Name of the Lord Jesus, and for the Worship of God, as though this were become a great crime worthy of Bonds, and (at last) death; he was had to the

Sessions in the Old Baily, and his accusers were Witnesses against him, and them that had abused him violently, their Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was received as good proof against him. And at last after two or three Sessions, he was fined by the Court one hundred Mark, which at last was reduced to twenty Mark, and to lie in prison while payment; Where he continued a pretty long sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, above 8 Months, with 6 or 7 score Prisoners be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the time of his sickness he was very fervent in prayer (and that often, both day and night) unto the Lord as concerning himself, and also his people; and at several times he spoke se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral precious words from the sensible feeling of God's spirit in his heart, and said, <hi>I have had the testimony of the Lords love unto me from my youth; and my heart hath been given up to do thy Will</hi>: And he said, <hi>I have preached the Gospel freely in this City, and have often given up my Life for the Gospels sake; and now Lord rip open my heart, and see if it be not right before thee.</hi> Another time he said when he had a little ease, <hi>There is no iniquity lyes at my door, but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Lord is with me, and his life I feel justifie me.</hi> Another day afterwards he said, <hi>Thou hast loved me when I was in the Womb, and I have loved thee from my Cradle, and from my youth unto this day, and have served thee faithfully in my generation.</hi> And he spoke to Friends that were about him, to live in love and peace, and love one another. And at another time he said, <hi>The Lord taketh the righteous from the evil to come</hi>; and he prayed for his Enemies, and for his persecutors, and said, <hi>Lord forgive</hi> Richard Brown, <hi>he may be forgiven.</hi> And though the distemper and the disease was violently upon him, yet he was preserved sensible; and in the morning before he departed this life, being sensible of his

               </gap>ictions which his life went under, and his upright spirit suffered by, both from his open enemies and persecutors in the World (because of the valour and courage for the Truth of God) and from deceitful and transforming exalted spirits, which burthen the holy Seed; but now his Life is caught up above them all (and is out of their reach) in the transcendent and unspeakable glory, in the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting habitation and firmament of God's Power, where he hath shined (and doth shine) among the Stars, that have kept their habitations, as one that hath turned many to righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and that hath overcome by the blood of the Lamb, and the Word of his Testimony, with those holy Prophets and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs who rejoice over <hi>Babylon</hi> and her abominations (in whom their blood is found) and against whom he was a faithful Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and valiant Warrier, whose living and absolute Testimony therein, God hath blessed, made prosperous, and wil fulfil to the uttermost.

            <p>To such in Gods fear I answer, That thousands of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord are of another perswasion, not questioning but it was in Gods tender love (as to his own particular) that he was removed out of the Earthen Vessel, in which he (though a man as in the prime of his years) endured great travel in his

time for the Truth's sake, and the gathering of many into the way of the Lord, and in which his travel was the greater (when the time of his dissolution drew near) to be dissolved, because of his suffering (and the extremity of his sicknesse occasioned thereby) which many others were partakers of, who suffered persecution and imprisonment by unreasonable men in this City of <hi>London,</hi> for the cause of God and of a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But this I testifie in the Lord, as in him I have felt, that his being removed, was in judgement from the Lord against his persecutors, who desired and sought his destruction; and what they have done against him hath greatly added to the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their iniquities, that the blood of the righteous which cryes for vengeance may be avenged to the utmost upon them who would not suffer the righteous to have a being amongst men, nor lay to heart their being taken away from the evil to come.</p>
            <p>And they who in a byassed or prejudiced spirit of enmity are lifted up because of his decease, they were not worthy of him, nor of his Testimony, and they have cause to mourn and lament amongst those that have pierced the just, and slighted and despised the Messengers of Truth and Righteousnesse, whom God hath therein honored, and God will debase such, and their vain glory unto the dust, and exalt the testimony and life of his faithful Witnesses over all their heads.</p>
            <p>But we who have been well acquainted with the deep suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the righteous Seed, and with the worth of true unity, in the weighty body and spirit of Christ, and therein do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the glory and compleatnesse of the City of our God, which is at peace within it self, cannot but prize the Ministers of Righteousnesse, and every Member of the same Body; and oh how blessed and precious is the memorial of the righteous in our eyes!

And these things (it is well known unto many) he was oft exercised in; and he did not go about in corners, nor creep into dark places hiddenly nor secretly, but preached the Truth of God, and Doctrine of our Lord Jesus Christ boldly and openly, even upon the house tops, and his valour for God's Truth on Earth, was well known unto many, and his voice was as the sound or ratling of the Charriots of God's Host upon the tops of the Mountains, and was oft uttered forth in the Name of the Lord, even like thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the voice of the Son of God was uttered forth through him, by which the dead was raised; the Witnesses are now alive, let them bring in their testimony, that the truth hereof may be confirmed. His Doctrine dropped as the Oyle of joy upon the Spirits of the mourners in Sion. His Life extended it self as a sweet stream into the hearts of the children of Light that thirsted after righteousness: He was one of the Cloud of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses that dropped down the dew upon the tender plants of God. He pleaded the cause of the innocent suffering Seed, and earnestly contended with the Powers of the Earth of all sorts, in the behalf, and for the freedom of the suffering people of God: He fore prophesied unto them that were in Authority in the days past, of their destruction, and of their overthrow, because of their deceitfulness to God, and their false and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, treacherous and merciless dealings towards his people, who had made many fair promises both to God and man in the time of their adversity, That they would grant free liberty of Conscience in things relating to the Worship of God, and that Oppression should be removed, and the like; but in the time of their prosperity, when they were waxen fat, and grown great, and lived at ease and in pleasures, then they forgot God, and regarded not to perform their Engagements neither to God

lest you sin your day away, and place of repentance there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be found: For this I tell you plainly, that it is in vain for you to strive against the Lord, or to seek to stop or hinder his work which he hath begun; for he will be too strong for you, and he will make you bow and bend to his own Name and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, whether you will or no.

               <l>MY Brother dear the Lord hath call'd away,</l>
               <l>That in this World he should no longer stay:</l>
               <l>Who was to many an Instrument of good,</l>
               <l>While in the body (in God's great Power) he stood.</l>
               <l>For many were from darkness by him turned</l>
               <l>Unto the Light, in which they were confirmed</l>
               <l>By the Power and Doctrine which to them was preached</l>
               <l>By him, through which God's true Witness was reached,</l>
               <l>In their dark hearts, where Satan long had reigned,</l>
               <l>Over whom (through God's great power) Victory's gained.</l>
               <l>He was a valiant Souldier of the Lamb,</l>
               <l>And faithful to the Lord did always stand,</l>
               <l>Till with his Life he seal'd his Testimony,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But now in peace with God he is sate down,</l>
               <l>And hath with Christ an everlasting Crown</l>

            <lg>
               <l>He was intrusted with the hidden treasure</l>
               <l>In a large, and in an abundant measure,</l>
               <l>Which he dispensed to the Lambs of God;</l>

            <lg>
               <l>He fed the Babes and Children with the Word,</l>
