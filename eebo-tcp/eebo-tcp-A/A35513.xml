         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>GReat Actions are the Subjects of
great Wits; and no Age hath
been ſo unhappy, but they have
great Perſonages, if not to exceed, yet
to ſecond and protect them. But the
Atchievements of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great,
are ſo great in themſelves, that they
are rather the Subjects of our Wonder
then Belief; nor can any man be a juſt
Judge of them, who is not indued with
<pb facs="tcp:46658:3"/>
the ſame Spirit of Fortitude, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
tranſported with the ſame deſire of
glory. Fame, indeed, is not ſo much
the bound, as the delight of Tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Spirits, who with the unwearied
Travels of their Swords, add Kingdoms
unto Kingdoms, and abſtract from the
number of the Nations, to add to the
numbers of their Conqueſts. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
have we read of, who almoſt ſince the
Cradle of the World, have exerciſed
thus the Power of the Sword, and by a
lamentable happineſs, have made the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitaphs
of other Nations to become the
beſt Annals of their Immortality and
Fury?</p>
            <p>But <hi>Alexander</hi> was as merciful as he
was juſt; and having overcome the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
by force, he always after, by a
newer and Nobler Conqueſt, did both
overcome and oblige them by his Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
By a rare felicity he had Fortune
intirely in his own Power; and at laſt
he would become the Maſter as much of
Fame as of Fortune: He was ſad to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
that his Atchievements had
brought him to the utmoſt parts of the
World; and he would have no end of
his Victories, becauſe he would have no
<pb facs="tcp:46658:3"/>
end of his Glory: Having exceeded the
Acts of Men, he would exceed even
Fame her ſelf, unleſs ſhe could finde
breath enough to raiſe him unto Heaven,
and leave him there inthron'd amongſt
his gods.</p>
            <p>And yet for all this vain attempt and
confidence, he might have ſlept cover'd
with the Duſt of Oblivion, were he not
beholden to a better Divinity, and to
the Light of Hiſtory, which have preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his Name throughout all Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
The Prophets have done the one,
and this our Author the other; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
in the Word of God, and our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
in this Hiſtory: A Hiſtory drawn
from the Records of Antiquity, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
as <hi>Ptolomy</hi> himſelf, a man as admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in the Arts of Peace as of War,
who being preſent with <hi>Alexander</hi> in all
his Wars, was both his Companion and
his Kinſman: A Hiſtory compoſed with
ſuch Art, ſuch State and Truth, that
<hi>Lipſius,</hi> the moſt Lettered, and moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of the Criticks, hath affirmed, If
there were ever Hiſtory pure and legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate,
it was this of <hi>Curtius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was before imperfect in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and
laboured at leaſt under a thouſand Sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſms;

I have only taken the pains to

            <p>IN theſe Martial Times, if any thing
can excite you yet higher to Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Atchievements, it will be the peruſal
of this Hiſtory, then which (if you reſpect
either the Excellence of <hi>Alexander,</hi> or the
Abilities of <hi>Curtius</hi>) you will finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more Magnificent or Delightful:
You will finde how Kingdoms are diſpoſed
of by the Eternal Decrees of Providence;
and that when God is pleaſed to put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
to them, he ſelects men, and inſpires
them with Courage and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding
anſwerable to that great Work unto which
he hath appointed them. None but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
could perform what <hi>Alexander</hi>
hath done; and though his courſe of life
was ſo ſhort, that he did rather deſtroy
then erect an Empire, yet we may wonder
as much at his Reſolution what he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook,
as at his ſucceſs in what he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.
With an inconſiderable Power,
with Wicker Targets, and Swords cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Ruſt, and a Stock of not above
<pb facs="tcp:46658:5"/>
threeſcore Talents, which he himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
was the ſtrength of his Exchequer,
he advanced into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
of a few years, he became Master of
all the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and, at that time, of the
moſt Flouriſhing and Potent Nations of
the World. He never encountred any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
whom he overcame not, nor beſieged
City which he took not, nor invaded Land
which he ſubdued not. Although the firſt
grounds of the War were in the days of
<hi>Xerxes,</hi> and his Predeceſſors, yet the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
of it, and the utter ruine of the
Empire, was in the days of <hi>Darius,</hi> the
laſt and beſt of the Emperours. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Revolution of States, and from
what ſmall beginnings great Powers do
ariſe, is no where more apparently to be

               <hi>PHilip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> who by ſubduing of <hi>Greece,</hi>
did firſt advance that Kingdom unto that
height of power, was the Son of <hi>Amintas;</hi> a man
indued with wiſdom, courage, and all other vertues
of a Noble Captain. This <hi>Amintas</hi> had by <hi>Euridice</hi>
his Wife three Sons, <hi>Alexander, Perdicas</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi>
who was the Father of Great <hi>Alexander,</hi> and a
Daughter called <hi>Eurione.</hi> The Queen <hi>Euridice</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enamoured with one that had married her
Daughter, conſpired the death of the King her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
to the intent to have married with her Son-in-Law,
and to make him King; which thing ſhe
had brought to effect, had not the Treaſon and
Laſciviouſneſs of the Mother been opportunely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
by the Daughter. After the death of <hi>Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46658:8"/>
Alexander</hi> the Eldeſt Son enjoyed his Fathers
Kingdom, who in the beginning of his Reign was
ſo aſſailed on all ſides, that he was driven by force
to purchaſe Peace of the <hi>Illyrians</hi> with Money, and
by giving his Brother <hi>Philip</hi> in Hoſtage: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
by the ſame Pledge, he made a like Peace
with the <hi>Thebans,</hi> which was the occaſion that
<hi>Philip</hi> did attain to ſuch Excellency of Knowledge
and Wiſdom; for by reaſon that he was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the cuſtody of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> who was a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
Captain, and an excellent Philoſopher, he was
brought up in the exerciſe of honeſt Diſciplines, and
Princely matters, greatly profiting under a Scholar
of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> School, whom <hi>Epaminondas</hi> kept in
his houſe for the inſtruction of his Son. In the
mean ſeaſon, <hi>Alexander</hi> was ſlain by the means of
<hi>Euridice</hi> his Mother; whoſe former Treaſon King
<hi>Amintas</hi> her Husband had pardoned, in reſpect of
the Children had between them, little thinking that
ſhe would afterwards have been their deſtruction:
For when <hi>Alexander</hi> was dead, ſhe cauſed, in like
manner, her other Son <hi>Perdicas</hi> to be ſlain; which
<hi>Perdicas</hi> left behinde him one Son, being a young
Babe. About the ſame time, <hi>Philip</hi> the youngeſt
Brother, having by good hap ſlipt away from his
Guardian <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> returned into <hi>Macedon;</hi>
and not taking upon him the Name of King, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
a great while, no otherwiſe, but as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
to his young Nephew. Nevertheleſs after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
by occaſion of ſundry miſchiefs growing in
the State, the ſame being ſuch as might not well
attend the Majority of the young King, <hi>Philip</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
to be a man of ſingular activity, and of no
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46658:8"/>
leſs skill in feats of War, then in knowledge of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
was compelled by the people to take upon
him the Kingdom of <hi>Macedon,</hi> which as then ſtood
in great difficulties, and danger of ruine. This was
done 300 years after the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in
the 105 <hi>Olympiad.</hi> In the beginning of his Reign
he was environed with infinite troubles; for all the
Neighbouring Countries (as it were by a general
Conſpiracy) moved War againſt him; and at one
time ſundry Nations combined together, out of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
parts, to aſſail his Kingdom: Wherefore, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that it ſtood him upon to move diſcreetly,
(not being able to Match them all at once) he pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
ſome with fair promiſes, others with money,
and the weakeſt he withſtood by force. By this
means he both made his Enemies afraid, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
the hearts of his people, whom he found
diſcouraged, and ſore amazed. Theſe things he
wrought with great Artifice and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ineneſs of wit, in
ſuch ſort, that he diminiſhed not any part of his
Honour, Eſtate or Reputation; determining never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
as time ſhould ſerve, to deal with every one
apart. His firſt War was with the <hi>Albenians,</hi> whom
he overcame by Wit and Policy: And whereas it
lay in his power to have put them all to the Sword,
he ſet them all at liberty, without Ranſom: By
which point of Clemency, though it was but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit,
being done for fear of a greater War at
hand, yet it procured him great Eſtimation and
Authority. After that, he ſubdued the <hi>Peons;</hi> and
from them turned his Power againſt the <hi>Illyrians,</hi>
of whom he ſlew many thouſands, and conquered
the famous City of <hi>Lariſſa.</hi> That done, he moved
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46658:9"/>
War againſt the <hi>Theſſalians;</hi> not for any deſire of
their goods, or ſpoil of their Country, but out of
a policy, to add to his ſtrength the force of their
Cavalry, which in thoſe days were accounted the
chiefeſt in the world. This he happily effected:
for being ſuddenly aſſailed, they were ſoon brought
to ſubjection; and <hi>Philip</hi> joyning the force of their
Horſemen unto his Footmen, he made his power
invincible.</p>
            <p>After all theſe things being brought to paſs, he
took to Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e <hi>Olympias,</hi> one of the Daughters of
<hi>Neoptolemus,</hi> King of the <hi>Moloſſi.</hi> This Marriage
was concluded by the means of <hi>Arisba,</hi> who had
the Government of <hi>Olympias,</hi> and not long before
had married her other Siſter <hi>Troas.</hi> This Marriage,
which he intended for his ſecurity, turn'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to his ſubverſion; for thinking to have made
himſelf ſtrong by the affinity of <hi>Philip,</hi> he was at
laſt by him deprived of the whole Kingdom, and
ended his life miſerably in Exile. Not long after
this Marriage, King <hi>Philip</hi> dreamed, that he ſaw
an excellent Medal faſtened to the W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mb of his
Wife; and to his ſeeming, the lively Image of a
Lyon thereupon: By which Dream the Divines did
interpret, that his Wife was conceived of a Childe
that ſhould be of a Lyons heart and courage; which
interpretation pleaſed him highly. Afterwards, at
the aſſault of a City called <hi>Methron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> by ſhot of an
Arrow he loſt his right eye; whereof though the
diſpleaſure was great, yet was he content, upon
their ſubmiſſion, to take them to mercy. He won
alſo the City of <hi>Pagus,</hi> and annexed the ſame unto
his Kingdom: He invaded the Land of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:46658:9"/>
and at one inſtant conquered it, with all the
Countries thereabout. Thus having made his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
ſtrong by ſubduing his Neighbours, at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
home his Wife <hi>Olympias</hi> was delivered of his
Son <hi>Alexander,</hi> on the eighth of the Ides of <hi>April.</hi>
Of theſe good fortunes the King rejoyced no leſs
then reaſon was, having eſtabliſhed his Country
at home, ſubdued his enemies abroad, and gotten an
Heir to ſucceed him in his Kingdom: he could
have deſired no more of God, if the minde of man
could ever be ſatisfied, which the more it hath,
the more it coveteth.</p>
            <p>As Dominion increaſeth, ſo doth alſo the deſire
to have more; which was well ſeen in <hi>Philip,</hi> that
ſtill did compaſs how to grow great by taking from
his Neighbours; and lay always like a Spy, waiting
an occaſion how to catch from every man; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
he had an opportunity offered by the Cities
of <hi>Greece:</hi> for whiles one did covet to ſubdue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and through ambition were at ſtrife who
ſhould be chief, by one and one, be brought them all
into ſubjection, perſwading the ſmaller States to
move War againſt the greater; and to ſerve his
purpoſe, contrived the ways to ſet them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the ears. But at length, when his practiſes
were perceived, divers Cities fearing his increaſing
power, confederated, againſt him as their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Enemy, but chiefly the <hi>Thebans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
neceſſity compelling, they choſe him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to be their Captain General againſt the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians,</hi>
and the <hi>Phoceans,</hi> who had ſpoiled
the Temple of <hi>Apollo.</hi> This War he honourably at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved;
ſo that by puniſhing of their Sacriledge,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46658:10"/>
he got himſelf great Renown in all thoſe parts. But
in the end, obſerving both thoſe Countries to be
brought low with the War, he found means to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
the one and the other; compelling, as well the
Overcomers, as the Overcome, to be his Tributaries.
Then he made a Voyage into <hi>Cappadocia;</hi> where
killing and taking priſoners all the Princes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about,
he reduc'd the Province to the ſubjection of
<hi>Macedon.</hi> He conquered <hi>Olinthus,</hi> and after invaded
<hi>Thrace:</hi> For whereas the two Kings of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
were at variance about the limits of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and choſe him to be their Arbitrator, he glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
took it upon him: But at the day appointed for
the Judgment, he came not thither like a Judge
with a Councel, but like a Warriour with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
and to part the ſtrife, expelled both Parties
from their Kingdoms. By this time young <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
was twelve years of Age, and began to take great
delight in the feats of War, ſhewing moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
ſignes of a Noble Heart, and an excellent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion.
He was very ſwift of foot; and one
day at a ſolemn game of Running, called <hi>The O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympick
Race,</hi> being demanded by ſome of his
Companions if he would run with them; <hi>Gladly,</hi>
(ſaid he) <hi>if there were Kings Sons to run with me.</hi>
On another time, when certain Embaſſadours of
the <hi>Perſians</hi> came into <hi>Macedon, Alexander,</hi> who
in his Fathers abſence took upon him to entertain
them; and diſcourſing with them of divers things,
in all his communication, there not paſſed not from
him one Childiſh or vain word; but he enquired
of them the ſtate of their Country, the manners of
the People, the diſtances of the Ways, the Power of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46658:10"/>
the King, and the order of his Wars, with ſuch
like: So that the Embaſſadours aſtoniſhed thereat,
eſteemed the Greatneſs of the Father, to be much
leſs then the Expectation of his Son; and that his
Courage was much greater then was to be looked
for in one of his years. As often as Tydings came
that the King his Father had conquered any ſtrong
or rich Town, or obtained any notable Victory,
he never ſeemed greatly joyful; but would ſay to
his Play-Fellows, <hi>My Father doth ſo many great
Acts, that he will leave no occaſion of any remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
thing for us to do:</hi> Such were his words, ſuch
was his talk: whereby it was eaſie to conjecture
what a Man he would prove in his Age, who ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
in his Youth. His delight was not ſet on any
kinde of pleaſure, or greedineſs of gain, but in the
only exerciſe of Vertue, and deſire of Honour:
The more Authority that he received of his Father,
the leſs he would ſeem to bear. And although by
the great increaſe of his Fathers Dominion, it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that he ſhould have the leſs occaſion of Wars;
yet he did not ſet his delight in vain pleaſure, or
heaping up of treaſure, but ſought all the means
he could to uſe the feats and exerciſes of War, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veting
ſuch a Kingdom, wherein for his Vertue
and Proweſs he might purchaſe Fame and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.
That hope never deceived <hi>Alexander,</hi> nor
any other, that had either will or occaſion to put
the ſame in practiſe.</p>
            <p>The Charge and Government of this young
Prince was committed to ſundry excellent Maſters,
but chiefly to the Philoſopher <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> whoſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
Learning and Knowledge King <hi>Philip</hi> ſo much
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46658:11"/>
eſteemed, that he would often ſay, he took no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
comfort in the birth of his Son, then that he was
provided with ſuch a Maſter as <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> under
whoſe Tuition he remained ten years. Many things
there hapned beſides, whereby it was conjectured,
that <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould prove a man of great valour:
For when his Father ſent to <hi>Delphos</hi> to receive an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
of the gods who ſhould be his Succeſſor, the
Oracle delivered, <hi>That ſuch a one ſhould not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
him only, but alſo be Lord of the World,
whom</hi> Bucephalus <hi>would ſuffer to ſit upon his Back.</hi>
This <hi>Bucephalus</hi> was a paſſing fair Horſe, fiery, and
full of courage, whom <hi>Philip</hi> had bought of a
<hi>Theſſalian</hi> for thirteen Talents; and becauſe of his
fierceneſs he kept him in a Stable impaled with iron
Bars: yet for all this, he remained ſo full of ſpirit,
that none could approach to dreſs him; whereof
the King was ſo wary, that he ſought the means
to be rid of the Horſe. It fortuned that <hi>Alexander</hi>
came one day with his Father into the Stable; <hi>What
a Horſe</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>is ſpoiled here for want of good
Horſemanſhip?</hi> And ſo coming more near, and
gently clapping him, without any great difficulty
he got upon his Back, and uſing both the Spur
and the Rod to the uttermoſt, he ran and managed
him ſo up and down, that the Horſe ſeemed proud
of his Rider: and having rode his fill, he brought
the Horſe back again. As he alighted, the King
for joy imbraced and kiſſed him, and with tears
in his eyes ſaid; <hi>O Son; ſeek out for ſome other
Kingdom ſuitable to the greatneſs of thy heart, for</hi>
Macedonia <hi>cannot ſuffice thee:</hi> So that even then
the prudent Father did preſage, that all his poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46658:11"/>
were far inſufficient for his Sons heart. After
this, King <hi>Philip</hi> determined to make War againſt
all <hi>Greece;</hi> for the maintainance whereof, he thought
it great advantage if he might firſt win <hi>Bizan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi>
a famous City on the Sea Coaſt. Wherefore
committing the Charge and Government of his
Realm to his Son, being then fifteen years of Age,
he laid ſiege to the Town, which made him great
reſiſtance: When he had diſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nded all his riches
and treaſure about the ſiege, he was driven to ſo
narrow a ſhift, that to furniſh himſelf with money,
he became a Pyrate, and roved on the Sea, where
he took 170 Ships, the ſpoil whereof he divided
among his Souldiers: And leaſt his whole Army
ſhould be detained about the ſiege of one City, he
ſelected the choiceſt Bands of all his Souldiers, and
marched into <hi>Cherſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſius,</hi> where he took and put
to ſack many Towns; and becauſe his Son <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
was then about eighteen years of age, and had
ſhewed an evident proof of his Vertue and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
in all his Attempts, his Father ſent for him
thither, to the intent, that under him he might
learn and exerciſe all the feats belonging to a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier;
and with him made a Voyage into <hi>Scythia,</hi>
upon no other quarrel but to ſpoil the Country.
Thus uſing the way of Merchants, with the gain of
one War he did bear out the charges of another.
After he brought the Country in ſubjection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
no riches of gold nor ſilver was to be gotten
there, he brought from thence 20000 men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and children, beſides a great multitude of
Cattel, with 20000 choice Mares to make a Race
in <hi>Macedon.</hi> In his return he was encountred by the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46658:12"/>
               <hi>Tribals,</hi> who denied him paſſage, except they
might have part of his Booty: Whereupon, deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the matter, from words they fell to fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
in which King <hi>Philip</hi> was ſo wounded in his
Thigh, that through the violence of the Thruſt, the
Horſe was run through the body; and all men
judging him to be ſlain, the Booty was loſt.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he was recovered of his wound, his
diſſembled grudge againſt the <hi>Athenians</hi> burſt out
ſo far, that he made open War againſt them; by
reaſon whereof, the <hi>Thebans</hi> ſeeing the danger ſo
near at hand, gave ſuccour to their Neighbours;
fearing, if the <hi>Athenians</hi> were overcome, the laſt
fury of the Wars would turn upon them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Cities that a little before were mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
one to another, combined together in one
League, and ſent their Embaſſadours through all
<hi>Greece;</hi> holding it moſt expedient, with a common
Aid, to withſtand a common Enemy: Some conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the peril to be univerſal, ſtuck to the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
and ſome obſerving <hi>Philip</hi>'s power increaſing,
and the other decreaſing, took part with <hi>Philip.</hi> In
this War, <hi>Alexander</hi> had the charge of one of the
Wings committed to him, wherein his Noble Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
did well appear; for he deported himſelf ſo
valiantly, that he ſeemed nothing inferiour to his
Father, nor any elſe, but by moſt juſt deſert got
the honour of the Victory; yet he was defrauded
thereof by the envy and ſleight of his Father, as
he himſelf complained afterwards. This Battel
was fought at <hi>Cheronaea;</hi> wherein, though the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi>
were the greater number, yet were they
overcome by the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> who were the fewer,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46658:12"/>
but expert Souldiers, by reaſon of their long and
continual practiſe in Wars: Nevertheleſs, the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi>
(as men not unmindful of their former
honour) loſt their lives valiantly. That day made
an end of all the <hi>Grecians</hi> glory, as well of their
large Rule and Government, as of their moſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Freedom and Liberty; which being hardly
won, and long time kept, was thus loſt in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For theſe things, and many other experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Valour and Proweſs in young <hi>Alexander,</hi>
although the King his Father did bear him ſingular
affection and favour; yet nevertheleſs, by certain
occaſions enſuing, that love was unhappily broken:
For <hi>Philip</hi> being married to <hi>Olympias,</hi> Mother of
<hi>Alexander</hi> (as is ſaid before) took to Wife, beſides
her, a Lady called <hi>Cleopatra;</hi> whereupon fell great
diſcord and unkindneſs between the Father and the
Son: The occaſion was given by one <hi>Attalus,</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
to <hi>Cleopatra;</hi> who being at the new Marriage,
exhorted the <hi>Macedons</hi> to make prayers to the
gods, to ſend the King and new Queen a lawful
Heir to ſucceed in the Kingdom of <hi>Macedon:</hi>
Whereat <hi>Alexander</hi> being moved, <hi>Vile man as thou
art</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>doſt thou count me a Baſtard?</hi> And with
that word flung the Cup at his head. The King
hearing this, roſe up, and with his Sword drawn
ran at his Son, who by the nimbleneſs of his body
avoided the ſtroke, ſo that it did him no harm.
Hereupon, <hi>Alexander</hi> inveighing againſt him with
many ſharp and deſpiteful words departed, and
went with his Mother into <hi>Epirus.</hi> Nevertheleſs,
ſoon after, by the means of one <hi>Demoratus</hi> a <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian,</hi>
who perſwaded the King that this diſcord
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46658:13"/>
was nothing for his Honour, <hi>Alexander</hi> was ſent for
again, and much ſolicitation was uſed before they
could be well reconciled: Wherefore, to confirm
this Attonement, there was a Marriage made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Alexander</hi> the Brother of <hi>Olympias</hi> (whom
<hi>Philip</hi> by the expulſion of <hi>Acisba</hi> had made King
of <hi>Epirus</hi>) and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> the new Queens Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The Triumph of the day was remarkable, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the State and Magnificence of ſuch two
Princes; the one beſtowing his Daughter, and the
other marrying a Wife. There were ſet forth ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
Interludes and Inventions, pleaſant to behold:
And as King <hi>Philip</hi> (between the two <hi>Alexanders,</hi>
the one his Natural Son, the other his Son-in-law)
was paſſing through the preſs without any Guard,
one <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> a young man of the Nobility of
<hi>Macedon,</hi> when no man ſuſpected any ſuch thing,
ſuddenly ſlew him; making the day dedicated to
joy and triumph, to be heavy with lamentation.
This <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> being a Boy, one <hi>Attalus</hi> inforced
to the unlawful uſe of his Body; and not content to
do ſo himſelf, at another Feaſt he cauſed divers of
his Familiars to abuſe him likewiſe: which ſhame
and villany grieved the young man ſo ſore, that he
complained to the King; whom although the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the fact moved much, yet for the love he
bare to <hi>Attalus,</hi> and for the reſpect of his ſervice,
he did forbear to animadvert againſt him. This <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talus</hi>
was very near unto the King, and in ſpecial
favour, by reaſon he was Kinſman unto the Queen
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> whom <hi>Philip</hi> had lately married: He
was alſo Elected Captain General of the Kings
Army prepared to paſs into <hi>Aſia,</hi> being one that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46658:13"/>
was both valiant in his perſon, and no leſs politick
in the diſcipline of War. Upon theſe reſpects, the
King endeavoured by all the means he could to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
<hi>Pauſanias,</hi> (incenſed with indignation and
revenge) as well by giving him great gifts, as by
placing him honourably among thoſe Gentlemen
that were for the Guard of his Perſon. But all this
could not appeaſe the rage of his implacable anger,
which wrought ſo in him, that he determined to
be revenged, not only upon <hi>Attalus</hi> that did the
villany, but alſo upon the King that would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
Juſtice; which determination he put in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
as is ſaid before. Many things might be ſaid
more of the doings and ſayings of this <hi>Philip;</hi> but
one thing above all others is to be noted, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though,
for the moſt part, he was exerciſed in the
travel of the Wars, and in Victorious Actions, yet
had he ever ſuch affection to the Studies of Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and good Learning, that he both did and
ſpake many things worthy of Memory, which
were both witty and pleaſant. He lived 47 years,
and Reigned 25, being the three and twentieth
King of the <hi>Macedons.</hi>

            <p>WHen <hi>Philip</hi> was dead, his Son, who for the
greatneſs of his Acts, was afterwards called
<hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> took upon him the Kingdom,
the 426 year after the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> being of
the age of twenty years: His ſtate ſtood at that
time ſubject to much envy, hatred and hazard from
all parts; for the Nations and Provinces, bordering
upon him, could not well endure their preſent bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
and every one of them ſought how to recover
again their ancient Dominions and Principalities.
The firſt thing he undertook, after he was King, was
the ſevere puniſhment of as many as had conſpired
his Fathers death; which performed, he celebrated
his Funerals with great ſolemnity. As for his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
he ſoon eſtabliſhed it; and that much better
then any man could have imagined in one of ſo
young and tender years: For being of ſome had in
contempt, and by ſome others ſuſpected to be cruel;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46658:14"/>
towards the one he deported himſelf ſo gallantly,
that he took from them all contempt; and to the
other ſo gently, that their imagined fear of his cruel
diſpoſition was clean taken away. He granted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Macedons</hi> freedom and priviledge from all
Exactions and Bondage, except from the ſervice of
War: By which act, he got ſo great favour and
love amongſt his people, that all affirmed by one
conſent, how the Perſon of their King was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and not his Vertue; his Name was altered,
but not his Government. In the beginning of his
Reign, Rebellion was made againſt him on all
ſides; but immediately, with an incredible cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and conſtancy of minde, he appeaſed all the
Tumults. That matter ſet in order, he went to
<hi>Corinth</hi> in <hi>Peloponneſus;</hi> where calling a General
Councel of all the States of <hi>Greece,</hi> he was Elected
Captain General againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
<hi>Greece</hi> with many overthrows, and at that
preſent did poſſes the greateſt Empire in the world.
His Father had deſigned this War before; but by
the prevention of death, he brought not his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to effect. Whileſt he was in preparation for
this Enterpriſe, he was informed how the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
the <hi>Thebans</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> were revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from him, and were Confederate with the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi>
by the perſwaſions of the Orator <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi>
who was corrupted by them with a great ſum of
money: For the Reformation whereof, <hi>Alexander</hi>
ſo ſuddenly advanced with his Army, that when he
came upon them, they could ſcarcely believe he
ſhould be preſent, having not received the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
of his March. In his way he treated with

<hi>Hercules,</hi> that by an Univerſal Decree of the whole

delivered up unto him all his Treaſures and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues:
So great was the celerity that this young
man uſed, and his diligence ſo effectual, that he
made all ſuch to fear him as before were revolted,
or had him in contempt. As the <hi>Athenians</hi> were
the firſt that failed, ſo they firſt of all repented,

of the Ancient Conquerours. They alſo ſent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours

and it they ſhould be invaded any other way then
by the <hi>Streights,</hi> they did determine to roul their
Carriages down the Hill upon the <hi>Macedons,</hi> to
break their array. That Device was put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but the Souldiers had received before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
by <hi>Alexander,</hi> as occaſion ſhould ſerve, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to open their array to let the Chariots and
Wheels paſs through them, or elſe to fall flat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

their Targets, to avoid the danger: They follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their inſtructions; and when the Chariots were
paſſed by, they with a great courage and ſhout
mounted up againſt their Enemies, and in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
put them to ſlight. When <hi>Alexander</hi> was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Mountain, he entred into the Country of the
<hi>Tribals,</hi> as far as the River of <hi>Ligeus:</hi> When <hi>Syr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
King of that Land underſtood of his approach,
he ſent his Wife, and his Children, with ſuch of his
people as were not meet for the wars, into in Iſland
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46658:17"/>
called <hi>Peuca,</hi> ſcituate within the River of <hi>Danubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us;</hi>
into which Iſland, the <hi>Thracians</hi> bordering with
the <hi>Tribals,</hi> were fled alſo: It was not long after
that <hi>Syrmus</hi> himſelf fled thither in like manner.
The reſt of the <hi>Tribals</hi> that were not with the
King, withdrawing themſelves into an other Iſland,
where they kept themſelves againſt <hi>Alexander:</hi> But
he by policy ſought the means to draw them out of
their ſtrength, whereby he ſlew of them to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of three thouſand, and the reſt fled away; ſo
that of priſoners but few were taken.</p>
            <p>After this Battel he marched towards the River
of <hi>Danubius,</hi> to the Iſland whither the <hi>Thracians</hi>
and the other <hi>Tribals</hi> were fled. They made nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
reſiſtance againſt him; which they might the
better do, by reaſon <hi>Alexander</hi> wanted Boats to paſs
into the Iſland; the Banks whereof were ſo high
and ſleep, that they would not be mounted on but
with great difficulty, the River running violently
ſwift, by reaſon that the Stream was there driven
into a ſtreight. When <hi>Alexander</hi> perceived the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility
to aſſault them, he withdrew to another
place; where getting a few Boats, in the night he
paſſed over one thouſand five hundred Horſemen,
and four thouſand Footmen. With that company
he ſet upon a people called <hi>Getes,</hi> who ſtood in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Battel, on the further ſide of the River, with
four thouſand Horſemen, and ten thouſand Footmen,
of purpoſe to ſtop the <hi>Macedons</hi> paſſage: But by
their ſudden coming over, the <hi>Getes</hi> were ſo afraid,
that they did not abide the firſt aſſault.</p>
            <p>It ſeemed to them a wonderful adventure, for
<hi>Alexander</hi> in one night, without a Bridge, to paſs
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46658:17"/>
his Army over the broadeſt and deepeſt River in all
<hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſtruck ſuch a fear and terrour in their hearts,
that they fled into the Woods, Mountains and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart
places, leaving their City deſolate; which was
taken by <hi>Alexander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Syrmus</hi> King of the <hi>Tribals,</hi> with the <hi>Germans,</hi>
and the other Inhabitants upon the River of <hi>Danu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi>
ſent their Embaſſadours thither unto <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
to enter with him into friendſhip: and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending
unto their requeſts, inquired of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
what thing it was which in the world they
doubted moſt; thinking indeed that the terrour of
his name had been the moſt fearful thing unto them.
But when they underſtood his meaning, they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<hi>That they doubted greatly the falling of the
Skie:</hi> with whoſe preſumptuous anſwer <hi>Alexander</hi>
was nothing moved, nor further replied; only he
ſaid, <hi>the</hi> Germans <hi>were a proud people;</hi> and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
diſmiſſed them. As he was going from thence
againſt the <hi>Agrians,</hi> and the <hi>Peans,</hi> he was adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
that <hi>Clitus Bardelius</hi> had rebelled, and had
confederated with <hi>Glaucius,</hi> the King of the <hi>Thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>launts.</hi>
He had alſo intelligence, that the people of
<hi>Anteri</hi> would give him battel in his paſſage: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he committed to <hi>Lagarus,</hi> King of the <hi>Agrians,</hi>
(who was well beloved of King <hi>Philip,</hi> and no leſs in
the favour of <hi>Alexander</hi>) the charge to go againſt
the <hi>Anterians,</hi> and promiſed him, upon his return,
to give him his Siſter <hi>Cyna</hi> in Marriage; and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
himſelf, with great celerity, marched againſt
<hi>Clitus</hi> and <hi>Glaucius,</hi> whom in ſundry battels he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercame.
Whiles <hi>Alexander</hi> was about theſe things,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46658:18"/>
he received intelligence, that divers Cities in <hi>Greece,</hi>
and ſpecially the <hi>Thebans,</hi> had rebelled; which
thing moved him much, and was the cauſe that he
returned with ſpeed to ſuppreſs theſe Commotions:
The <hi>Thebans,</hi> in the mean ſeaſon, beſieged the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
of <hi>Thebes,</hi> wherein was a Garriſon of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,</hi>
and endeavoured by all means to be Maſters
of it: <hi>Alexander,</hi> by great journeys, advanced to
their reſcue, and encamped with his Hoaſt near to
the City. Such as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

when they ſaw him come contrary to their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,
and doubting whether ſuch aid ſhould
come to them from other Cities as was promiſed,
began to conſult how to proceed: At length, by a
general conſent, they determined to abide the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
and extremity of the War.</p>
            <p>The King in the mean ſeaſon ſtood at a ſtay, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them ſpace to be better adviſed, and alter
their reſolution: For he was of opinion, that no
one City would have made reſiſtance againſt ſo great
a Power as he had, being above 30000 Footmen,
and 3000 Horſemen; all old Souldiers, and expert
in the travels of War: The truſt of their experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and valour had cauſed him to undertake the
War againſt the <hi>Perſians.</hi> Truly, if the <hi>Thebans</hi>
had given place to Fortune and time, and would
have required Peace, they might eaſily have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
his deſire was ſo great to paſs into <hi>Aſia</hi> againſt
the <hi>Perſians.</hi> But the <hi>Thebans</hi> being determined to
try their force, and not to make any ſuit, fought
againſt the <hi>Macedons,</hi> far exceeding them in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
with great reſolution: but whileſt the Battels
were joyning, the Garriſon of the Caſtle iſſued out

upon the <hi>Thebans</hi> backs; whereby being incloſed,
they were vanquiſhed, their City taken, ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and utterly razed: Which extremity <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
uſed of purpoſe, becauſe he thought the reſt

that the Orators were reſerved, and the Captains
baniſhed; who ſtraight fled to <hi>Darius</hi> King of

            </p>
            <p>At ſuch time as <hi>Alexander</hi> aſſembled the <hi>Grecians</hi>

if he had need of any thing that he might do

               </gap>orbad his

180 Ships: wherefore it is hard to judge whether
it be more wonderful, that he conquered the
World, or that he durſt attempt the conqueſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

Enterprize, he choſe not out the young men in the

Souldiers ſeemed to be School-maſters of the Wars,
and the Captains, for their gravity, appeared to
be Senators in ſome Ancient Commonwealth:
which was the occaſion, that in the Fight none of
them minded flying; but every one, confident of
the Victory, did not truſt to his feet, but to his
hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander,</hi> who every where made Sacrifice, did

judged him moſt happy of all men before him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in ſuch glory he died young, and had his Acts
ſet forth by ſuch a one as <hi>Homer</hi> was. From thence
he paſſed forwards into the Dominions of <hi>Darius</hi>
King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who being the Son of <hi>Arſanus,</hi> and
the fourteenth King after <hi>Cyrus,</hi> had the poſſeſſion
of the Monarchy of the whole <hi>Eaſtern</hi> part of the
World. The chiefeſt cauſe that moved <hi>Alexander</hi>
to invade him, was to be revenged of the dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and deſtructions wherewith the Predeceſſors of
<hi>Darius</hi> had afflicted the Country of <hi>Greece,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
for demanding Tribute of <hi>Philip</hi> his Father; for
the which he ſent a proud and preſumptuous Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage,
calling himſelf, <hi>The King of Kings,</hi> and
<hi>Kinſman of the Gods.</hi> Laſtly, he had written to
<hi>Alexander,</hi> and called him his Vaſſal; and gave
Commiſſion to his Lieutenants, that they ſhould
beat that Mad Boy (the Son of <hi>Philip</hi>) with Rods,
and afterwards bring him to his Preſence in Kings
Apparel: And furthermore, that they ſhould ſink
both Ships and Marriners, and convey all the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
that ſhould be left alive, beyond the <hi>Red Seas.</hi>
They therefore purpoſing to execute the Kings
Commandment, aſſembled their Power at the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of <hi>Granike,</hi> which doth divide the Country of
<hi>Troy</hi> from <hi>Propontides,</hi> having to the number of
20000 Footmen, and as many Horſemen; with
whom they had taken the ground, on the other ſide
of the River, where <hi>Alexander</hi> muſt needs paſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
whereof when he was advertiſed, though he
ſaw apparent danger in the Enterprize, to fight in
the water; and the <hi>Ouze</hi> againſt his Enemies, who
had the advantage of the higher Bank; yet upon a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46658:20"/>
ſingular truſt to his own good Fortune, and the
courage of his Souldiers, he charged upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</p>
            <p>At the firſt he was ſore encountred, and put in
great danger of repulſe; but at length he van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed
and overthrew them: In doing whereof,
there neither wanted policy in himſelf, nor ſingular
Manhood in his men. There was ſlain in that Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> twenty thouſand Foot, and two
hundred and fifty Horſe; and of the <hi>Macedons</hi> but
thirty four. This Victory was greatly advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to <hi>Alexander</hi>'s deſigne; for thereby he won the
City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> being the chief ſtrength the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
had for the Maſtering of the Seas: unto which
City, and to all the reſt of the Country of <hi>Lydia,</hi>
he gave liberty to live under their own Laws.</p>
            <p>He got alſo under his poſſeſſion the City of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,</hi>
which, the fourth day after the Battel, was
abandoned by the Garriſon which <hi>Darius</hi> ſet there.
In the mean ſeaſon, there came Embaſſadours from
<hi>Magnetio,</hi> and from the <hi>Triallians,</hi> proffering the
delivery of their Cities. <hi>Parmenio</hi> was ſent to them
with three thouſand Footmen, and two hundred
Horſemen; with which Power he won <hi>Miletum,</hi>
that made-ſtrong oppoſition: And marching from
thence towards <hi>Hilicarnaſſus,</hi> he got all the Towns
thereabouts at the firſt approach, and afterwards
beſieged <hi>Hilicarnaſſus</hi> it ſelf; which with great tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
he overcame at length, and razed it to the
ground.</p>

               <hi>Alexander</hi> did enter into this Town, being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
of the Inhabitants; and perceiving they were
fled into the Caſtle, which he determined to win
before he departed, he firſt ſent to ſummon them
by an Herald, who declared, that except they would
yield themſelves, they ſhould ſuffer the extremity
of the Law of Arms. They brought the Herald in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an high Tower, which was ſtrong both by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Art, willing him to conſider the height
and ſtrength thereof, and to declare unto <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
that he had not a full dimenſion of the ſtrength
of the place, for they did know it to be impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable;
and if the worſt ſhould fall, yet were they
ready to die in their Allegiance. Notwithſtanding
their words, when it came to the point, that they
ſaw themſelves beſieged, and all things were ſcarce,
they took Truce for forty days, with this Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
<hi>That if they were not reſcued by</hi> Darius <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that time, they would render it up into his hands:</hi>
Which they did afterwards at the day appointed,
when they ſaw no Succours coming.</p>
            <p>To that place there came Embaſſadours to him
from <hi>Athens,</hi> making requeſt, that ſuch of their
City as were taken priſoners at the Battel fought
upon the River <hi>Granike,</hi> might be reſtored to them.
To whom anſwer was made, that when the Wars
of <hi>Perſia</hi> were once brought to an end, both theirs,
and all others that were <hi>Greeks,</hi> ſhould be reſtored
to their liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> had his preſent care and reſolution al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
upon <hi>Darius,</hi> who he knew had not yet paſſed
the River <hi>Euphrates:</hi> He aſſembled therefore all his
Powers together, purpoſing to adventure the hazard
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46658:22"/>
of the Battel. The Country was called <hi>Phrygia</hi>
that he paſſed through; plentiful of Villages, but
ſcarce of Cities: yet there was one of great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
called <hi>Gordium,</hi> the Royal Seat ſometime of
King <hi>Mydas.</hi> The River of <hi>Sangaray</hi> doth run
through it, and it ſtandeth in the mid-way betwixt
the Seas of <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> being judged to be
the narroweſt part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> by reaſon of the Seas
which lye on both ſides, repreſenting the form of
an Iſland; and if it were not for a finall point of
Land that doth lye betwixt thoſe Seas, they would
joyn both together. <hi>Alexander</hi> having brought this
City under his obeyſance, entred into the Temple
of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> where he ſaw the Chariot wherein <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi>
the Builder of the City, was accuſtomed to
ride: The ſame, in the furniture and outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
differed little from other common Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots;
but there was in it a thing notable, which
was a Cord folded and knit with many knots, one
ſo intricate within another, that no man could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the manner of it, neither where the knots
began, nor where they ended: Hereupon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
men had a Prophecy, <hi>That he ſhould be Lord of
all</hi> Aſia, <hi>that could undo that endleſs Knot.</hi> This
poſſeſt the King with a marvellous deſire to become
the fulfiller of the Prophecy: there ſtood a great
number about him, both of <hi>Phrygians,</hi> and of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedons,</hi>
the one part of them expecting the event,
and the other fearing the raſh preſumption of their
King, for as much as they could perceive by no
reaſon how the Knot ſhould be undone: The King
himſelf alſo doubting, that the failing of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
in that matter, might be taken as a token of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46658:23"/>
his evil Fortune to come, after he had conſidered
the thing; <hi>What is the matter</hi> (quoth he) <hi>which way
it be undone?</hi> and ſtriving no longer how to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knit
it, he with his Sword cut the Cords aſunder;
thereby either illuding, or elſe fulfilling the effect
of the Prophecy.</p>
            <p>This being done, <hi>Alexander</hi> purpoſed to finde
out <hi>Darius</hi> whereſoever he went; and to the intent
to leave all things clear behinde his back, he made
<hi>Amphitorus</hi> Captain of his Navy upon the Coaſt of
<hi>Helleſpont,</hi> committing the charge of the Field-Army
to <hi>Egilochus:</hi> They two had Commiſſion
to deliver the Iſlands of <hi>Lesbos, Scios</hi> and <hi>Coos,</hi> from
the hands of the <hi>Perſians;</hi> and for the proviſion of
their charges, had appointed to them fifty Talents,
and ſent to <hi>Antipater,</hi> and ſuch others who had
the Governance of the Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> ſixty Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents:
He gave order, that ſuch as were his Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates,
ſhould with their own power of Ships de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the Seas of <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> according to the
League betwixt them. It was not yet come to his
knowledge that <hi>Memnon</hi> was dead, whom he moſt
ſuſpected; well knowing, that if he moved not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, no man ſhould be his ſtop before he
came to <hi>Darius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> came to the City of <hi>Ancira,</hi> where he
made his Muſters, and ſo entred into <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi>
whereunto the <hi>Grecians</hi> border, of whom it is ſaid
the <hi>Veneti</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> are deſcended: all this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
ſubmitted to him, and gave him Pledge, being
excuſed from Tribute, ſeeing they never paid any
to the <hi>Perſians. Calas</hi> was Captain there, who
taking with him the Band of Souldiers that were
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46658:23"/>
lately come out of <hi>Macedon,</hi> marched into <hi>Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia:</hi>
but <hi>Darius</hi> hearing of the death of <hi>Memnon,</hi>
was no leſs moved therewith then the caſe required;
for then all other hope ſet apart, he determined to
try the matter in perſon; for he condemned all
things that had been done by his Deputies, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Courage and Conduct to be wanting in many
of them, and that Fortune had failed in them all:
He came therefore to <hi>Babylon,</hi> where he encamped,
and aſſembled all his Forces together in ſight of the
City, becauſe he would ſhew the greater Courage;
and uſing the enſample of <hi>Xerxes</hi> in taking of his
Muſters, he entrenched ſo much ground about, as
was able to receive ten thouſand men, within the
which he lodged in the night ſuch as had been mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered
in the day, and from thence they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
abroad in the plain Country of <hi>Meſopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia.</hi>
The number of his Horſemen and Footmen
were innumerable, and they yet ſeemed in ſight to
be more then they were. There were of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi>
an hundred thouſand, of whom thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
were Horſemen; of the <hi>Medians,</hi> ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Horſemen, and thirty thouſand Footmen;
of the <hi>Bactrians,</hi> two thouſand Horſemen with
broad Swords and light Bucklers, and ten thouſand
Footmen with like weapons: There were of the
<hi>Armenians</hi> forty thouſand Footmen, and ſeven
thouſand Horſemen: The <hi>Hircanians,</hi> of great eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
amongſt thoſe Nations, had ſix thouſand
Horſemen: The <hi>Dervicens</hi> were forty thouſand
Footmen, armed with Pikes, whereof part had no
heads of Iron, but the points of them dried in the
fire: There were alſo of the ſame Nation two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46658:24"/>
Horſemen. There came from the <hi>Gaſpian</hi> Sea
eight thouſand Footmen, and two hundred Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
And with them of the rude Nations of <hi>Aſia,</hi>
two thouſand Footmen, and four thouſand Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
To the increaſe of theſe numbers, there were
thirty thouſand Mercenary Souldiers that were
<hi>Greeks:</hi> Haſte would not ſuffer to call for the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choſians,
Sogdians</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> with others the
Inhabitants of the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> Nations which had
names ſcarcely known to their own King. Thus
<hi>Darius</hi> wanting nothing leſs then the multitude of
men, greatly rejoyced to behold them; and puffed
up with the vanity and flattery of the great men
which were about him, turned to <hi>Charidemus</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi>
an expert Man of War (who for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
that <hi>Alexander</hi> did bear him, was baniſhed
the Country) and asked him, if he thought not
that company ſufficient to overthrow the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons?</hi>
Whereat <hi>Charidemus,</hi> without reſpect of
the Kings pride, or of his own Eſtate, anſwered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Peradventure, Sir, you will not be content to hear
the truth, and except I tell it preſently, it ſhall be
too late hereafter: This great preparation, and
mighty Army of yours, gathered of the multitudes
of ſo many Nations, raiſed up from all parts of the
Orient, is more fearful to the Inhabiters herea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts,
then terrible to your Enemies: Your men
ſhine in Colours, and gliſter in Armour of Gold, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
ſo much in riches, that they which have
not ſeen them with their eyes, cannot conceive any
ſuch thing in their mindes: But contrariwiſe, the
<hi>Macedons</hi> being rough Souldiers, without any ſuch
exceſs, be terrible to behold: The Fronts of their
<pb facs="tcp:46658:24"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:46658:25"/>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:46658:25"/>
Battels ſtand cloſe together, always in ſtrength, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with Pikes and Targets for defence: That
which they call the <hi>Phalanx,</hi> is an immoveable
ſquare of Foot, wherein every Band ſtand cloſe to
each other, joyning weapon to weapon: Every
Souldier is obedient to that which is commanded,
ready at his Captains call, whether it be to follow
his Enſigne, to keep his Array, to ſtand ſtill, to run,
to fetch a compaſs, to change the order of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
to fight on this ſide, or that ſide; every Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
can do theſe things as well as the Captains:
And becauſe you ſhall not think Gold and Silver to
be ſo effectual to this matter, they began and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
this Diſcipline, Poverty being Maſter: when
they be weary, the ground is their bed; they are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with ſuch meat as they finde by chance; and
they meaſure not their ſleep by the length of the
night. Think you the Horſemen of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> the
<hi>Achaians</hi> and <hi>Aetolians,</hi> which be invincible Men of
War, will be repulſed with Slings or Staves burned
in the fire? It behoveth you to have like Force to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and to be ſerved of the ſame condition of men:
My counſel is therefore, that you ſend this Gold
and Silver to levy Souldiers out of thoſe Countries
from whence they come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Darius</hi> was a man of a milde and tractable diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
if the height of his Eſtate had not altered
the goodneſs of his Nature; which made him ſo
impatient to hear the truth, that he commanded
<hi>Charidemus</hi> to be put ſtraightways to death, being
a man that was fled to his protection, and that had
given him right profitable counſel: When he was
going towards his death, he left not his liberty to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:46658:26"/>
ſpeak, but ſaid, <hi>There is one at hand that ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
my death; for he againſt whom I have given
thee counſel, ſhall puniſh thee for not following my
advice: And thou being thus altered with the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
thou haſt, being now a King, ſhalt be an example
to ſuch as ſhall come after; that when they commit
themſelves to Fortune, they clearly forget their names.</hi>
Whileſt <hi>Charidemus</hi> was ſpeaking of theſe words,
they which had the charge committed unto them,
did put him to death; whereof the King afterwards
took over-late repentance, confeſſing him to have
ſpoken the truth, and cauſed him to be buried.
There was one <hi>Thymones,</hi> the Son of <hi>Menter,</hi> a
young man of great activity, to whom <hi>Darius</hi> gave
the charge of all the Forreign Souldiers, (in whom
he had great confidence) willing him to receive them
at <hi>Pharnabaſus</hi> hands; and gave to <hi>Pharnabaſus</hi> the
Rule that <hi>Memnon</hi> had before.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Darius</hi> being careful of the great buſineſs
he had in hand, whether it were through penſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of minde, or that his fancy did divine things
to come, was continually troubled with Viſions in
his ſleep: He dreamed that the <hi>Macedons</hi> Camp
was on fire; and ſhortly after it ſeemed to him that
<hi>Alexander</hi> was brought to his preſence in ſuch kinde
of apparel as he himſelf did wear when he was firſt
choſen King; and that <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould be carried
on Horſe-back through <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſo vaniſh out
of ſight. Hereupon the Interpreters of Dreams be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokened
good fortune to himſelf, becauſe of the fire
that ſeemed to be in his Enemies Camp, and for
that <hi>Alexander,</hi> without any veſture of a King, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in the vulgar apparel of the <hi>Perſians.</hi> Others
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46658:26"/>
did interpret it otherwiſe, that the Lightning in
the <hi>Macedons</hi> Camp, ſignified glory and victory to
<hi>Alexander,</hi> and alſo the enjoyment of the Empire of
<hi>Aſia;</hi> which they made more clear, foraſmuch as
<hi>Alexander</hi> appeared in the ſame Veſtures that <hi>Darius</hi>
did wear when he was choſen King. Care beſides,
and anxiety of minde (as often chanceth) brought
things paſt again to remembrance.</p>
            <p>It was rehearſed how <hi>Darius</hi> in the beginning of
his Reign, changed the Scabbard of his Sword from
the <hi>Perſian</hi> manner, into the faſhion that the <hi>Greeks</hi>
uſed; whereupon the <hi>Caldees</hi> did prognoſticate,
that the Kingdom of the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſhould be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
to thoſe whoſe faſhion he had counterfeited:
Notwithſtanding, being glad of the interpretation
of the Diviners, which was every where publiſhed
concerning his ſucceſs, and of the Viſion that he
ſeemed to have ſeen in his ſleep, he commanded his
Army to march forwards towards the River of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates.</hi>
It was the Ancient Cuſtom amongſt the
<hi>Perſians,</hi> at Sun-riſing, to raiſe their Camp, and a
warning of their ſetting forwards, to be by the ſound
of a Trumpet at the Kings Pavilion, upon which
there ſtood the Image of the Sun incloſed in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal,
ſhining ſo bright, that it might be ſeen tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout
the Camp: The order of their marching,
was in this manner; the Fire, which they call Holy
and Eternal, was carried before on ſilver Altars;
next to them were the Diviners, ſinging after their
Country manner; there followed three hundred
ſixty five young men in Scarlet Robes, like in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
unto the days of the year; then came the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
conſecrated to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> drawn with white Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46658:27"/>
and a great Horſe following, which they call
<hi>The Horſe of the Sun:</hi> Such as did ride upon the
Palfreys, did wear white Garments, bearing Rods of
Gold in their hands. Next in order came ten Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots,
garniſhed and wrought with ſilver and gold:
The Horſemen of twelve Nations followed in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
ſorts of Armour; then came a Company that
the <hi>Perſians</hi> called <hi>Immortal,</hi> the riches of whoſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel
exceeded far the reſt, they had all Chains of
Gold, Coats embroidered with Gold, and Sleeves ſet
with Pearl: Theſe were followed, within a ſmall
diſtance, by a Band of fifteen thouſand Souldiers,
called <hi>Doripherii,</hi> reputed for the Kings Kinſmen,
and apparelled almoſt like Women; more notable
for the variety of the riches of their Garments, then
the Armour they did wear. Such as were wont to
receive the Kings Robes, did ride next before the
Chariot, upon the which <hi>Darius</hi> did ſit on high,
with great pomp and magnificence, his Chariot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
garniſhed on both ſides with carved Images of
their gods, made of ſilver and gold; the beams
whereof were ſet with Pearls and precious Stones,
with two Images of Gold ſtanding thereupon, of a
cubit length, one oppoſite to the other; and over
their heads an Eagle of Gold diſplayed: But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the reſt, the Kings Apparel ſeemed marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
ſumptuous, which was of Purple empaled
white, with a Border imbroidered of Gold, and Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Faulcons, ſo wrought, as if they were fighting
together. He was girt Effeminately with a Girdle
of Gold, and the Sword that hung thereupon had a
Scabbard of Pearl: the Diadem which he did wear
upon his head, called by the <hi>Perſians Cydaris,</hi> had a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:46658:27"/>
Roll about it of white and green. Next behinde
the King came ten thouſand Horſemen, who had
all their Spears plated with ſilver, and their Spear-heads
guilded. He was incloſed on both ſides with
two hundred of the Blood Royal; at whoſe backs
there followed thirty thouſand Footmen, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them four hundred of the Kings Courſers. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

on Horſeback. Next to them w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nt fifteen Chariots,
wherein the Kings Children were carried, and their
Nurſes, and their Eunuchs, which are greatly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
in that Country: After them followed three
hundred of the Kings Concubines, all apparelled
like Queens: Then came ſix hundred Mules, and
three hundred Camels that carried the Kings Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
guarded with a Band of Archers. The Wives
of the Kings Kinſmen, and the other that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the King, came riding next; and after them
a great company of Slaves and Varlets. Laſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> came
the Rereward lightly armed, whereof every Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſeverally with his own Company cloſed the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;

            <p>But on the other ſide, beholding <hi>Alexanders</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
there was to be ſeen a great difference; neither
the Men nor the Horſe gliſtered ſo with gold and
precious Furnitures, but only with the brightneſs of
their Harneſs: They were obedient to their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
Command, always in a readineſs to ſtay, or to
advance; neither oppreſſed with the multitude, nor
peſtred with too much Baggage: They wanted not
in any place, either ground for their encamping, or
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:46658:28"/>
victuals for their feeding, whereby their ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
was always ſufficient when they came to fight:
Whereas <hi>Darius,</hi> the Lord of ſo huge a multitude,
through the ſtraitneſs of the ground wherein he was
driven to give battel, was compelled to uſe the
fewneſs of men, which he before had deſpiſed in the
Enemy. <hi>Alexander</hi> appointed to <hi>Abiſtamines</hi> the rule
of <hi>Cappadocia;</hi> and marching with his Army towards
<hi>Cilicia,</hi> came to the place called <hi>Cyrus</hi> Camp, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Cyrus</hi> lodged there when he paſſed into <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi>
againſt King <hi>Croeſus.</hi> This place was diſtant
about fifty furlongs from the <hi>Streight</hi> entring into
<hi>Cilicia:</hi> The Country-men uſe to call thoſe <hi>Streights
Pylae,</hi> where the natural ſcituation of the place had
made a Fortification, as it were with mans hands.
When <hi>Arſenes,</hi> Governour of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> underſtood of
<hi>Alexanders</hi> coming, remembring what <hi>Memnon</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
in the beginning of the Wars, he put it in
execution when it was too late, waſting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
throughout <hi>Cilicia</hi> all ſuch things as he
thought might ſtand his Enemy in ſtead, leaving the
Country waſte which he was not able to defend:
whereas it had been much better to have taken the
<hi>Streight</hi> before his Enemies, where from the Hills
lying over the way, he might without hazard have
hindred his entry, or have diſtreſſed his paſſage: But
he leaving a ſmall number for the defence of the
<hi>Streight,</hi> retired himſelf back to waſte the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
which his part had been to defend from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
By his departure it came to paſs, that
ſuch as he left behinde, thinking themſelves betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
would not ſo much as abide the ſight of their
Enemies, when a much leſs number had been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:46658:28"/>
to have kept the paſſage; for the ſcituation
of <hi>Cilicia</hi> is ſuch, that it is environed about with a
continual rough and ſteep Mountain, which riſing
from the Sea on the one ſide, and fetching a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
about, joyneth again with the Sea on the other
ſide. Though the part of the Mountain which ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
furtheſt from the Sea, is plain and full of Rivers,
amongſt the which two are moſt famous, <hi>Pyramus</hi>
and <hi>Cydnus,</hi> but <hi>Cydnus</hi> moſt eſpecial, not ſo much
for its greatneſs, as the clearneſs of the water, which
from his firſt Spring runneth clearly through all
the Country, and hath no other River running
into him to diſturb the pureneſs of the ſtream; for
which cauſe it remaineth always clear and cold, by
reaſon of the Woods that do ſhadow all the banks.
Time hath conſumed many Antiquities within that
Country, which are remembred of the Poets:
There may yet be ſeen the foundations of the Cities
of <hi>Lirneſſus</hi> and <hi>Cebeſtus,</hi> with the Cave and Grove
<hi>Corycian,</hi> where <hi>Saffron</hi> groweth, with many other
things, whereof now remaineth but only their
name.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> entred the <hi>Streights</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
and beheld the ſcituation of them, he never
in all his life marvelled more at his own felicity;
confeſſing, that it had not been poſſible for him to
have paſſed, if any had ſtood at defence againſt him;
for that with ſtones only he might have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed;
the <hi>Streight</hi> beſides being ſo narrow, that
there could not paſs above four in front: to the
increaſe of which difficulty, the tops of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
hung over the way, which in many places
was broken and hollow with the ſtreams that ran
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:46658:29"/>
down from the Hills. <hi>Alexander</hi> ſent the <hi>Thracians</hi>
that were light armed, to ſcour and diſcover the
ways, for fear the Enemies ſhould lie there in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh,
and ſuddenly break forth upon him: He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
alſo a Band of Archers to take the top of the
Hill; which were willed ſo to march, that they
might be always in a readineſs to fight. After this
manner he came to the City of <hi>Tarſus,</hi> which was
ſet on fire by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> becauſe <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould
finde no harbour there: but <hi>Parmenio</hi> was ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a choice number of Horſemen to quench
the fire; who underſtanding that the Enemies were
fled away at the news of their coming, entered into
the City, and by that means ſaved it from burning.</p>
            <p>The River of <hi>Cydnus,</hi> ſpoken of before, did run
through this City, where the King arrived about
mid-day, it being in the Summer ſeaſon, at what
time the heat is no where more violent then in that
Country: He took ſuch delight in the pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the water, that he would needs bathe his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
therein, to waſh away the ſweat and duſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
and being very hot, he entred naked into the
water, in the ſight of all his Souldiers, thinking it
ſhould be a contentation to them, to ſee that the
Garments about his body were no other but ſuch as
they commonly uſed themſelves to wear.</p>
            <p>He was no ſooner entred, but all the parts of his
body began to ſhake and tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mble, his face waxed
pale, and the lively heat was mortified in all parts
of his body; his Servants took him up, and carried
him into his Tent as one beſides himſelf, and at the
extreme point of death: then there was a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
and heavineſs in the Camp; they wept, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:46658:29"/>
and bewailed, that ſuch a King, ſo Noble a
Captain, as had not been ſeen in any Age, ſhould be
thus taken from them in the height of his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
and after ſuch a manner; not in Battel ſlain
by his Enemies, but bathing in a River. It grieved
them, that <hi>Darius</hi> now being at hand, ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Victory by ſuch a chance, without ſeeing
of his Enemy; and that they ſhould be enforced to
return back again, as men vanquiſhed, by thoſe
Countries through which they had paſſed before as
Conquerours; in which Countries all things being
deſtroyed by themſelves, or by their Enemies, they
muſt of neceſſity die for hunger, though no man
ſhould purſue them. It became a queſtion amongſt
themſelves, who ſhould be their Captain in flying
away? or what he were that durſt ſucceed <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?</hi>
and though they might ſafely arrive at the Sea
of <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> yet who ſhould prepare them paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
there? When they had diſputed theſe queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
their argument, by and by, was turned into
compaſſion towards their Prince; lamenting, as
men out of their wits, that ſuch a Flower of Youth,
ſuch force of courage as was in him, that their King
and Companion in Arms, ſhould after this manner
be plucked from them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the mean ſeaſon,</hi> Alexander <hi>began to draw his
winde ſomewhat better; and when he came unto
himſelf, he lifted up his eyes, and began to know his
friends that were about him: That the vehemency
of his ſickneſs ſomewhat aſſwaged, was perceived,
in that he began to underſtand the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>il he was
in: But the ſolicitouſneſs of his minde was a
great hinderance unto his health; for tidings came,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:46658:30"/>
that</hi> Darius <hi>within five days would be in</hi> Cilicia:
<hi>He could not but take it grievouſly, that ſuch a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
ſhould be plucked out of his hands through
his infirmity, and that he ſhould be taken as one
tyed in Fetters, and be put to ſome ſhameful and
vile death. He called therefore to him both his
Friends and Phyſitians, and ſaid unto them,</hi> Ye ſee
in what an extremity of condition Fortune hath ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
me; methinks the noyſe of mine Enemies doth
ring in mine ears, and I who moved firſt the War,
am now challenged, and provoked to the Fight. When
<hi>Darius</hi> did write to me ſuch proud Letters, he was
not ignorant of mine Eſtate; yet peradventure he ſhall
be deceived, if I may uſe mine own minde in recovery
of mine own health. My caſe requireth no ſlack Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
nor ſlow Phyſitians; I had rather die ſtoutly
once, then to conſume long time in my recovery: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if there be any hope or cunning in Phyſick, let
it be now ſeen; and think that I ſeek not remedy ſo
much for mine own life, as I do for the care I have to
encounter with mine enemies.</p>
            <p>When they heard him ſpeak theſe words, they
were in great doubt of his ſudden raſhneſs; and
therefore every one particularly did deſire him, that
he would not increaſe his peril through any paſſion,
but ſuffer himſelf to be ordered by the advice of his
Phyſitians: For they alledged, that unapproved
Remedies were not ſuſpected of them without cauſe,
ſeeing his Enemy had gone about to corrupt ſuch as
were about him, by promiſing a thouſand Talents
to his Killer; they thought no man would be ſo
bold to make any experience of Phyſick upon him,
w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ch for the want of tryal thereof might in any
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:46658:30"/>
wiſe give cauſe of ſuſpition. There was amongſt
the excellent Phyſitians that came with <hi>Alexander</hi>
out of <hi>Macedon,</hi> one <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Acarnam,</hi> who was
preferred to him for preſervation of his health, and
had faithfully ſerved him from his Childhood, and
therefore loved him with entire affection: He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to provide for the King an approved Remedy,
but ſuch a one as would work vehemently; but by
the drinking thereof he doubted not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he ſaid) but
to expulſe the force of his diſeaſe. That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
pleaſed no man, but only him who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
all things better then delay: <hi>Darius,</hi> and his power,
were always in his eye; and he had an aſſured con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
that the Victory ſhould fall on his ſide, if he
might be able to ſtand in the fight of his men: the
thing that only grieved him was, that the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
would not miniſter before the third day. In the
mean ſeaſon, <hi>Parmenio,</hi> whom of all his Nobility he
truſted moſt, had exhorted him by his Letter, that
he ſhould not commit himſelf to the cure of <hi>Philip,</hi>
for that he was corrupted by <hi>Darius</hi> with a thouſand
Talents, and the promiſe of his Siſter in Marriage.
Thoſe Letters brought the King into great jealouſie,
and moved him to conſider ſecretly with himſelf all
thoſe things that either fear or hope could put into
his fancy. Shall I adventure (thought he) to drink
this Medicine? What if it be poyſon? Shall I not
then be accounted the cauſe of mine own death?
Shall I ſuſpect the fidelity of my Phyſitian? or ſhall
I ſuffer mine Enemy to kill me in my bed? yet were
it better for me to periſh by other mens Treaſon,
then thus to die through mine own faint heart. His
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:46658:31"/>
minde being thus diverſly perplexed, he would ſhew
the Contents of the Letter to no man, but ſealed it
with his own Ring, and laid it underneath his Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
Two days were paſſed in theſe imaginations,
and the third day the Phyſitian came to his Beds-ſide
with the Medicine ready made: When the King
ſaw him, he raiſed himſelf upon his Elbow; and
taking the Letter in his left hand, with the other
hand took the Cup, and ſtraightway ſupped it off:
When he had ſo done, he delivered the Letter to
<hi>Philip</hi> to read; and whileſt he was reading, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
him continually in the face; ſuppoſing, that if
he had been faulty, ſome token would have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his countenance. When <hi>Philip</hi> had read the
Letter, he ſhewed more tokens of diſpleaſantneſs
then of fear; and therewithal fell down upon his
knees, and ſaid; <hi>Sir, I ſee my life doth depend upon
your health; but your Recovery ſhall declare, that I
am falſly charged with this Treaſon; therefore when
by my means you ſhall get your health, I truſt you
will not then deny me my life: In the mean ſeaſon lay
fear aſide, and ſuffer the Phyſick to work, and to have
its operation; keep your minde quiet, and ſuffer not
your ſelf to be troubled with the ſuperſtitious careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of your friends; which though it proceedeth of
good will, is notwithſtanding a great impediment unto
your health.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His words not only ſatisfied the King, but made
him to conceive perfect hope of his recovery; and
ſaid unto <hi>Philip, If the gods would have granted
thee to adviſe with thy ſelf of a way to prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
I have in thee, and the good will I bear thee,
thou couldeſt never have choſen ſo good a one as this;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:46658:31"/>
for notwithſtanding the Letter, I drank off the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
believing thee to be no leſs careful for declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of thine own truth, then for my health;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
gave him his hand: Yet afterwards, when
the Medicine began to work, it was ſuch in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
that it ſeemed to verifie <hi>Parmenio</hi> his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation;
for he fainted oft, and had much labour to
draw his breath. Then <hi>Philip</hi> left nothing unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
or undone, that might ſerve for his purpoſe:
he laid warm cloaths to his body; and always as he
fainted, revived him again with ſweet ſavours: and
when he perceived him once come to himſelf, he
ceaſed not to feed him with diſcourſe; and one
while put him in remembrance of his Mother and
Siſters, another while of the great Victory that was
at hand.</p>
            <p>When the power of the Phyſick once entred into
his veins, there appeared ſtraight in all parts of his
body manifeſt tokens of health; Firſt quickneſs
came to the Spirits, and afterwards the body reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
his ſtrength a great deal ſooner then any man
looked for: For after the third day that he had been
in this ſad condition, he walked in the ſight of the
Souldiers, who wonderfully rejoyced to ſee him:
And they ſhewed no leſs affection unto <hi>Philip,</hi> whom
every one ſeverally imbraced, and gave him thanks,
as if he had been a God. It cannot be expreſſed,
beſides that Natural Veneration that <hi>Macedons</hi> uſe
to bear unto their Prince, in what Reverence they
eſpecially had <hi>Alexander,</hi> and how fervently they
loved him: They had conceived of him an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that he could enterpriſe nothing, but that
it was furthered by the Divine Aſſiſtance; and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:46658:32"/>
Fortune was ſo favourable unto him, that his raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
was always an increaſe of his glory: his age
being ſcarcely ripe, and yet ſufficient for ſo great
things, did marvellouſly ſet forth all his doings; and
many things, which out of the Wars would be
counted lightneſs, were moſt acceptable to the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers;
as the exerciſing of his body amongſt them,
his apparel not differing from the common ſort,
with his courage and forwardneſs in the Field:
which gifts given him by Nature, and ſome things
beſides done of policy, did get him both the love
and reverence of his people.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Darius</hi> heard of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s ſickneſs, he
marched towards <hi>Euphrates,</hi> with all the haſte he
could make in the conveyance of ſo multitudinous
an Army: He made there a Bridge, and in fifteen
days paſſed over it, his people having a great deſire
to get into <hi>Cilicia</hi> before his Enemy. <hi>Alexander</hi> had
recovered his ſtrength, and was come to a City call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Solos,</hi> which the Inhabitants yielded unto him,
and for two hundred Talents obtained aſſurance:
Notwithſtanding he put a Garriſon into the Caſtle,
and there celebrated Plays and Triumphs which he
had vowed to <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> and <hi>Minerva,</hi> for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of his health; where being ſo quietly given
to his Sport, he ſhewed how little he eſteemed the
coming of his Enemies. Whilſt <hi>Alexander</hi> was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied
about theſe things, he received pleaſant news,
how his men won a Battel againſt the <hi>Perſians</hi> at
<hi>Halicarnaſſus;</hi> and that the <hi>Mindians</hi> and <hi>Cawni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
with divers other Nations in thoſe parts, were
brought under his obedience.</p>
            <p>Theſe Sports being once ended, he removed, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:46658:32"/>
by a Bridge made over the River of <hi>Pyramus,</hi> he
came to the City of <hi>Malon;</hi> and from thence, with
another motion, came to a Town called <hi>Caſtabulum.</hi>
There <hi>Parmenio</hi> returned to the King, who had
been ſent to ſearch the <hi>Streights</hi> that lay between
them and the City of <hi>Iſſum:</hi> He had prevented the
<hi>Perſians</hi> at that Paſſage; and ſo leaving men for the
defence thereof, he poſſeſſed himſelf of the City of
<hi>Iſſum</hi> that was left deſolate: He departed from
thence, and did drive the <hi>Perſians</hi> out of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
ſearching and clearing all the ways; ſo that
having made all things ſure for the Army to paſs,
he returned again, both the Author of the Act,
and the Reporter of the thing done. <hi>Alexander</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
within the City of <hi>Iſſum,</hi> and there deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in Councel, whether it were better to paſs on
further, or elſe to tarry there for a more ſure pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
which was coming to him out of <hi>Macedon:
Parmenio</hi> was of Opinion, that this place was moſt
ſafe to abide <hi>Darius</hi> in, and to give him Battel,
where both the Armies ſhould be of like force, by
reaſon of the <hi>Streights,</hi> wherein no great multitude
can fight at once. He ſhewed reaſons why they
ought to eſchew the Plains, wherein their Enemies
ſhould have great advantage through their great
number, by which they might cloſe them about;
wherein (he ſaid) he feared not his Enemies ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
but feared their own men might be overcome
with wearineſs, where a multitude ſhould fight with
a few, and freſh men ſucceed in the place of them
that fainted. This Counſel was received for good,
and <hi>Alexander</hi> determined in the ſame place to abide
his Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:46658:33"/>
There was in the Hoſt of the <hi>Macedons</hi> one <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenes</hi>
a <hi>Perſian,</hi> ſent before time from the Governour
of <hi>Aegypt</hi> unto King <hi>Philip;</hi> who being advanced
with reward and promotions, choſe to live out of
his own Country; and ſo following <hi>Alexander</hi> into
<hi>Aſia,</hi> was eſteemed among thoſe that the King
truſted well: A Souldier of <hi>Greece</hi> delivered him a
Letter from <hi>Nabarzanes, Darius</hi> Lieutenant; he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
him to do ſome notable Enterpriſe, whereby
he might win favour and reputation with <hi>Darius:
Syſenes</hi> innocent of this matter, was divers times
about to preſent the Letter to the King; but ſeeing
him full of weighty affairs in providing for the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
he prolonged the matter: and whileſt he wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for a more convenient time, he brought himſelf
in ſuſpition of Treaſon; for the Letter was brought
to the Kings hands before it was delivered to him,
who reading it, did ſeal the ſame with a ſtrange
Seal, and cauſed it to be delivered to <hi>Syſenes,</hi> to
prove thereby his fidelity: But becauſe he concealed
the thing many days, and opened not the matter to
the King, it ſeemed that he conſented thereunto;
and therefore by the Kings Commandment he was
put to death by the hand of the <hi>Grecians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Greek</hi> Souldiers which <hi>Thimones</hi> had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of <hi>Pharnabaſus</hi> (being thoſe that <hi>Darius</hi> truſted
moſt) were now come to him: They perſwaded
much <hi>Darius</hi> to retire back into the Plains of <hi>Meſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia;</hi>
and if he would not do ſo, that at the
leaſt he ſhould divide his power, and not commit
the whole force of his Eſtate to one ſtroke of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
            <p>This Counſel was not ſo diſpleaſant unto the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:46658:33"/>
King, as to ſuch as were about him; For they ſaid,
Mercenary Souldiers were alwayes full of Treaſon,
and were to be doubted the more, for that they
counſelled the Army to be divided; which was for
no other purpoſe, but only that they might have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to fly to <hi>Alexander,</hi> when they ſhould
have any charge committed unto them: there is
nothing therefore more ſure for us (quoth they) than
to incloſe them round about with our Army, and to
cut them in pieces for an example to the world,
that Treaſon may never be left unrevenged: but
<hi>Darius,</hi> who was of a meek and good diſpoſition,
refuſed to commit ſo cruel an act, in ſlaying ſuch as
had betaken themſelves to his truſt: For he ſaid, <hi>If
we ſhould defile our hands with their blood, what
ſtrange Nation would ever then commit themſelves
into our hands?</hi> and alledged, <hi>that there ought no
man to loſe his life for giving fooliſh Counſel; for
who would be bold to give counſel, if in counſelling
there ſhould be any peril? I call you</hi> (quoth he) <hi>to
counſel daily, and hear the diverſity of your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and miſtruſt not them that give me not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
the beſt counſel.</hi> He cauſed the <hi>Greeks</hi> to be
anſwered, that he gave them thanks for their
good will: but in returning back, he ſaid, that he
ſhould give up his Country into his Enemies hands,
which was not convenient; and conſidering the
force that Fame is of in War, in going back (he
alledged) he ſhould appear to fly: But to defer
the fight he thought it worſt of all, ſeeing ſo great
an Army as he had (the Winter then approaching)
could not be victualled in a deſolate Country, that
had been waſted both by themſelves and by their
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:46658:34"/>
enemies. And for the dividing of his power, he
ſhewed that he could not do it, obſerving the cuſtom
of his Predeceſſors, who were not wont to hazard
the Battel, but with all their power: He declared,
that <hi>Alexander</hi> before his coming ſeemed terrible to
the world; and through his abſence was brought
into a vain preſumption: but after he ſaw him
come forwards, he became wary and well adviſed,
hiding himſelf in the ſtraights of the Mountains,
like thoſe coward-Beaſts, who hearing the noiſe of
the Paſſengers, do hide themſelves in the dens of
the Woods: He hath deluded his Souldiers (quoth
he) with his counterfeit ſickneſs; but now I will
not ſuffer him to prolong the fight any longer, which
if he will refuſe, I will oppreſs him in his lurking
holes.</p>
            <p>Theſe words he ſpake with greater oſtentation
than truth: and ſent his Treaſure and Jewels with
a ſmall Convoy to <hi>Damaſcus</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> and entred
with his Army into <hi>Cilicia,</hi> bringing with him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Country manner, both his Mother,
his Wife, his little ſon and his daughter. It ſo chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
that on the ſame night, in which <hi>Alexander</hi> was
come to the ſtreight entring into <hi>Syria, Darius</hi>
came to the place which they call <hi>Pyla Amanica:</hi>
the <hi>Perſians</hi> not doubting at all but that the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi>
would have forſaken the City of <hi>Iſſum,</hi> and flie
away for fear; for certain of them that were weak
and could not follow the Army, were taken; whom
<hi>Darius,</hi> through inſtigation of the Great men about
him, raging in barbarous cruelty, cauſed their hands
to be cut off, and to be led about his Camp, to the
intent they might behold the multitude of his Army;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:46658:34"/>
and after ſufficient view taken, he let them go, to
declare to <hi>Alexander</hi> what they had ſeen. <hi>Darius</hi>
removed, and paſſed the River of <hi>Pyramus,</hi> purpoſing
to purſue after the <hi>Macedons,</hi> which he thought had
been flying away: They who had their hands cut
off, came running in amongſt the <hi>Macedons,</hi> infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
that <hi>Darius</hi> was advancing in great haſte and
fury. There was ſcarcely any credence given to
their words: but to be more certain of it, <hi>Alexander</hi>
ſent Spies towards the Sea-coaſt, to know whether
<hi>Darius</hi> were there in perſon, or elſe had ſent ſome
other to make a ſhew of a power. The Spies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning,
advertiſed that his whole Army was at
hand; and ſtraightway the Fires might be ſeen,
which gave ſuch a ſhew (by reaſon they lay ſtragling
ſo far abroad to get Forrage) as though the whole
Country had been on Fire.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> was aſcertained of the truth, he
incamped in the ſame place where the tidings came
unto him, being marvellouſly glad becauſe he knew
he ſhould fight; eſpecially in the ſtreights, being
the thing he had always moſt deſired. But as it is
commonly ſeen, when danger and extremity is at
hand, that confidence is turned into fear; ſo now
he doubted, not without great cauſe, that Fortune
might change upon him, by whoſe favour he had
done ſo great acts; and conſidered her mutability
by ſuch things as ſhe had taken from others, and
given unto him. He ſaw there was now no proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the time; but that after one night paſſed,
the Victory ſhould be determined. On the other
ſide, he called to remembrance, that the honour of
the Victory was a reward that far exceeded the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46658:35"/>
and as it was doubtful whether he ſhould
overcome or no; ſo he was certain if overcome, to
die with honour and perpetual Glory. When he
had weighed th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe things, he gave order that the
Souldiers ſhould refreſh themſelves, and at the third
Watch be armed in a readineſs to advance. He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
went up into the top of a Mountain with many
Lights and Torches about him, where he made ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
unto the gods after his Country manner:
And when the hour was come, he appointed the
Souldiers at the third ſound of the Trumpet, they
ſhould be in a readineſs to march out to fight. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
was then given unto them, to paſs on
with courage and confidence; and by the break of
day they were come to the Streights, wherein their
purpoſe was to prevent <hi>Darius.</hi> By that time ſuch
as were ſent before to ſcour the Country, came in,
and reported that the <hi>Perſians</hi> were within thirty
Furlongs. The Battels were then ſtayed, and ſet
in ſuch order as they ſhould fight.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Alexander</hi> was advertiſed of <hi>Darius,</hi> ſo was
he advertiſed of <hi>Alexander</hi> by the Peaſants of the
Country, who came fearfully running, unto him,
declaring, that <hi>Alexander</hi> was at hand. Theſe words
were not believed; for they could not think them to
becoming, whom they thought before to be fled.
But when they perceived that it was ſo indeed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were in better order to purſue their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
then to encounter them in battel, they were
ſtruck with a marvellous ſudden fear. Every man
took him to his Armour in haſte; which haſte, and
the calling that one made upon another, did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
amaze them: Some run up to the tops of the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46658:35"/>
hills to view the <hi>Macedons,</hi> others fell to bridling
their horſes; ſo that the Hoſt full of diverſity, and
not ruled by any certain government, with their
hurley-burley did put all things out of order. <hi>Darius</hi>
at firſt had appointed one part of his power to take
the Mountains, who ſetting upon his enemies backs,
might incloſe them both behind and before: and
aſſigned another company to paſs along the Sea-ſide,
which was on the right hand, to keep his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
doing on every part. He gave order alſo that
twenty thouſand footmen with a Band of Archers,
ſhould paſs the River of <hi>Pyramus,</hi> and give an onſet
that way; but if they found any impediment why
they might not do ſo, then he willed them to retire
into the Mountains, and invade their Enemies on
their backs: but fortune, which was of greater force
than any policy, determined thoſe things that were
well deviſed, according as ſhe thought good. For
ſome durſt not for fear execute the thing that was
commanded them, and then the reſt laboured in
vain: for where the members fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l; the whole body
is confounded. The order of <hi>Darius</hi> Army ſtood
thus arranged to fight: his power was divided into
two Battels, one marching on the left-hand, the
other on the right; <hi>Nabarzanes</hi> impaled the Battel
on the right-hand with a great power of Horſemen,
and thirty thouſand Slingers and Are<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46658:36"/>
ſuch Nations as were counted moſt Valiant: there
were about the King, being alſo in the Battel, three
thouſand choice horſemen that were of the ordinary
Guard of his Perſon; and forty thouſand footmen,
with the horſemen of <hi>Hercania</hi> and <hi>Media,</hi> and the
horſemen of other Nations were wings on both
ſides: And beſides theſe numbers, there went before
his Battel in a forlorn Hope, ſix thouſand ſlingers
and caſters of Darts. All the plain ground between
the Streights was filled with Men of War; <hi>Darius</hi>
Battel ſtood thus aranged from the Mountain down
to the Sea-ſide. The mother and wife of <hi>Darius,</hi>
with all the women, were received in the middeſt of
the Battel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> on the other ſide, ſet his ſquare Battel
of footmen called the <hi>Phalanx</hi> (being the <hi>Macedons</hi>
chiefeſt force) in the fore-front: <hi>Nicanor</hi> the ſon of
<hi>Parmenio</hi> was Captain of the Battel on the right
hand, and with him, <hi>Cenos</hi> and <hi>Perdicas, Meleager,
Ptolomeus</hi> and <hi>Amintas,</hi> every one a Colonel of his
own Regiment: <hi>Parmenio</hi> and <hi>Craterus</hi> had the
rule of the Battel on the left hand, which ſtretched
toward the Sea; but <hi>Parmenio</hi> had the chief charge.
The Horſemen were ſet in wings to both thoſe Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,
the <hi>Macedons</hi> and <hi>Theſſalian</hi> Horſemen being
appointed to the right-hand Battel, and the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of <hi>Pelop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nneſus</hi> to the Battel on the other ſide:
before which Battel there were alſo ſet Slingers,
with Archers among them; and the <hi>Cretians</hi> that
were lightly armed, advanced before the main Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.
The Band of <hi>Agrians</hi> that were lately come
out of <hi>Greece,</hi> were aſſigned to encounter with thoſe
that <hi>Darius</hi> had ſent to take the top of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:46658:36"/>
He willed <hi>Parmenio,</hi> that as much as might be,
he ſhould ſtretch out his Forces towards the Sea, and
withdraw as far as he could from the Hills which
the Enemies had taken; but ſuch as had direction
by <hi>Darius</hi> to take the Hills, neither durſt reſiſt ſuch
as came againſt them, nor yet compaſs about ſuch
as were paſſed by them, but fled away at the firſt
fight of the Slingers: which thing chanced well for
<hi>Alexander,</hi> for it was the thing that he doubted
moſt, that they from the higher ground ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
the open ſide of his Battel, which lay unſlank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
towards them. The <hi>Macedons</hi> marched 32 in a
rank<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the ſtreightneſs of the ground would not
ſuffer them to move in a broader body; but by
little and little, as the plain between the Mountains
began to enlarge, ſo they had liberty to make their
Battels broader, and alſo for the horſemen to march
upon the ſides.</p>
            <p>When both the Battels were come within fight
of each other, the <hi>Perſians</hi> firſt gave a terrible and
rude ſhout, which was again doubled by the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedons,</hi>
not with their number, which was far infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
unto the <hi>Perſians,</hi> but with the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bound of the
Hills and the Rocks, which doubled every voice
of theirs. <hi>Alexander</hi> did ride up and down before
the fronts of his Battels, making a ſigne to his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
with his hand, that they ſhould not make too
much haſte to joyn with their Enemies, for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves out of breath; and as he went by,
he uſed to every Nation ſundry exhortations, as
he thought convenient for their diſpoſitions and
qualities: He put the <hi>Macedons</hi> in remembrance of
their ancient courage, and the number of Battels
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46658:37"/>
that they had won in <hi>Europe,</hi> that they were come
thither by his conduct not only to ſubdue <hi>Aſia,</hi> but
the uttermoſt bounds of the Orient. He ſhewed
them to be the people that were ordained to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
the world, and to paſs the bounds of <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>
and <hi>Bacchus;</hi> he declared that both <hi>Bactria</hi> and
<hi>India</hi> ſhould be theirs; in reſpect of which, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
that they had yet ſeen were but trifles, and
theſe were to be gotten all with one Victory: <hi>Their
Travel</hi> (he ſaid) <hi>ſhould not now be in vain, as it
was in the barren Rocks of</hi> Illyria, <hi>or in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of</hi> Thrace; <hi>but in this Conqueſt the Spoil of the
whole Orient was offered unto them; for the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
whereof they ſhould ſcarcely need to handle their
Swords, ſince the Battels of their Enemies wavered
ſo already for fear, that with their approach only
they had almoſt put them to flight.</hi> He recalled his
Father <hi>Philip</hi> unto their memory, how he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
the <hi>Athenians,</hi> with the Country of <hi>Boetia;</hi>
how he raſed to the ground the noble City of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes:</hi>
he made rehearſal to them of the Battel won at
the River of <hi>Granike,</hi> and of all the Cities that he
had taken, or that had been yielded unto him,
with the Countries they had paſſed through and
ſubdued.</p>
            <p>When he came unto the <hi>Greeks,</hi> he deſired them
to call to mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d the great Wars that had been made

firſt by the pride of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and after by <hi>Darius,</hi> who

               </gap> that the Rivers could not ſerve them for Drink,

               </gap> the Earth furniſh them with Victuals for Food:
He rehearſed alſo how the Temples of their gods
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:46658:37"/>
had been by them polluted and conſumed, their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
overthrown, and all Truces broken, which ought
to be confirmed both by divine and humane Law,
when he paſſed by the <hi>Illyrians</hi> and <hi>Thracians,</hi> which
were accuſtomed always to theft and ſpoil; he invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them to behold their enemies which gliſtered
with gold, and bare no armour but ſpoil for them to
take: he incouraged them to go forwards like men,
and pluck the prcy from thoſe effeminate women,
and to make exchange of their craggy Rocks and
Mountains full of ſnow, for the plentiful grounds and
lands of <hi>Perſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this time both Armies were advanced within
the throw of their Darts, and <hi>Darius</hi> Horſemen gave
a fierce charge upon the right-hand-Battel of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedons.</hi>
For <hi>Darius</hi> deſire was to try the Battel by
Horſemen, rightly judging, that the chiefeſt power
of his Enemies conſiſted in their ſquare Battel of
Footmen: So that the Battel where <hi>Alexander</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained,
was brought to the point of being incloſed
round, if he had not perceived the ſame in time; and
commanding two Bodies of his Horſe to keep the
top of the Hill, he brought all the reſt of them to the
incounter of his Enemies. Having then drawn the
<hi>Theſſalian</hi> Horſemen where they ſtood to fight, he
commanded their Capt. to bring them about behinde
the Battels, and there to joyn with <hi>Parmenio,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
with courage what he ſhould appoint them.</p>
            <p>By this time the <hi>Phalanx</hi> of the <hi>Macedons,</hi> in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
incloſed about with their Enemies, fought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
on all parts: but they ſtood ſo thick, and were
ſo joyned one to another, that they wanted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to
wield their weapons. They were ſo mingled, that in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:46658:38"/>
caſting their darts they one letted another, few light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on their enemies, and the moſt part falling on the
ground without harm: and being forced to joyn
hand to hand, they valiantly uſed the ſword. Then
there was great effuſion of blood; for both the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
cloſed ſo near, that their Harneſs claſhed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
weapon againſt weapon, and foined at one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers
faces with their Swords.</p>
            <p>There was no place for the fearful or the coward
to fly back, but each ſet his foot to other; and by
fighting kept ſtill their place, till they could make
their way by force; and ſo always paſſed forwards
as they had overthrown their Enemies: As they
were wearied and travelled thus with fighting, they
were ever received with freſh Enemies; and ſuch as
were wounded might not depart out of the Battel
(as it had been ſeen elſewhere) their Enemies aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them ſo fiercely before, and their fellows thruſt
on ſo hard behind. <hi>Alexander</hi> that day did not
only ſuch things as pertained to a Captain, but adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
himſelf as far as any private Souldier, covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by all means to kill <hi>Darius,</hi> which he eſteemed
the greateſt honour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Darius</hi> rode aloft upon his Chariot, giving great
provocations both for his Enemies to aſſail him, and
for his own Men to defend him: As <hi>Oxatres</hi> his
brother appeared moſt notable amongſt them all in
his furniture and perſonage, ſo in affection towards
the King he exceeded far the reſt, eſpecially in
that caſe of neceſſity; for when <hi>Alexander</hi> approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
near, he thruſt in before <hi>Darius</hi> with the band
of Horſemen, whereof he had the charge, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing
divers, he put many more to flight. But
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:46658:38"/>
the <hi>Macedons</hi> ſwarmed ſo about the King, and were
in ſuch a courage by the Exhortation that each
made to other, that they charged again upon the
Band of Horſemen: Then the ſlaughter was great,
and the overthrow manifeſt; about the Chariot of
<hi>Darius</hi> the nobleſt of his Captains lay, dying ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
in the ſight of their Prince. For juſt as
they received their deaths wounds, ſo they fell,
without turning their backs. Amongſt them, <hi>Aty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
Romithres,</hi> and <hi>Sabaces</hi> Governour of <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
having the charge of great numbers of men, were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown
and ſlain; and about them there lay by
heaps a huge number of the vulgar ſort, both of
horſemen and footmen. Of the <hi>Macedons</hi> alſo ſome
were ſlain, ſpecially ſuch as preſſed moſt forward:
among whom the right ſhoulder of <hi>Alexander</hi> was
lightly hurt with a ſword. In this throng the horſes
that drew <hi>Darius</hi> Chariot, were thruſt in with
Pikes, and growing outragious with the ſenſe of pain,
began to ſtruggle and overthrow their Maſter. He
fearing therefore to be taken alive, leaped from the
Chariot, and was ſet upon a l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d Horſe, and ſo fled
away, caſting his Diadem from his Head, that he
might eſcape unknown. Then the reſt of his Army
were diſperſed by fear, and flying by ſuch ways as
were open for them, they threw away the Armour,
which before they had taken for their defence: of
ſuch a nature is fear, that it refuſeth the thing that
ſhould be its ſafeguard.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Parmenio</hi> ſaw them fly, he ſtraight com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Horſemen to purſue them, and put all
his Enemies to flight that were on that part. But
on the other hand, the <hi>Perſians</hi> did put the <hi>Theſſalian</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:46658:39"/>
Horſemen to a fore diſtreſs, for at the firſt ſhock they
had broken one of their Troops; yet for all that
they wheeled about, and rallying themſelves, they
charged again the <hi>Perſians</hi> with ſo much courage,
that they ſoon brake their Order, and overthrew
them with a great ſlaughter. The <hi>Theſſalians</hi> had
herein a great advantage, by reaſon that the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
beſides that they are armed themſelves, have
their horſes alſo barbed with Plates of Steel, which
was the cauſe they could not on the Charge, or on
the Retreat, be ſo quick as the <hi>Theſſalians</hi> were; for
the <hi>Theſſalians,</hi> by their celerity, wherein the force
of Horſemen chiefly conſiſteth, had overthrown ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them before they could turn their horſes about.
When <hi>Alexander</hi> underſtood that his men prevailed
on their Enemies on that Wing likewiſe, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured
to follow in the Chaſe, which he durſt not
do before he knew the Battel to be clearly won, and
the Enemies repelled on all ſides.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> had not about him above a thouſand
Horſemen, with whom he ſlew many thouſands of
his Enemies; for who is he that in an overthrow or
Chaſe can number men? Thoſe few <hi>Macedons</hi> drove
the multitude of their Enemies before them like
ſheep; and the ſame fear that cauſed them to fly,
ſtayed them likewiſe in their flying. The <hi>Grecians</hi>
that were on <hi>Darius</hi> ſide, under their Captain <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mintas</hi>
(who ſometime had been in great Authority
with <hi>Alexander,</hi> but then againſt him) brake out
from the reſt, and marched away in order of Battel;
but the <hi>Perſians</hi> fled divers ways, ſome directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Perſia,</hi> and ſome by unfrequented ways eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
by the Mountains and the Woods. A few there
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:46658:39"/>
were that recovered their former Camp, which they
could not defend any time againſt the <hi>Macedons</hi> who
were Conquerours, but the ſame immediately was
won, abounding with gold and ſilver, and moſt rich
Moveables, appertaining not only to the Wars, but
to all voluptuouſneſs and exceſs; which riches,
whiles the Souldiers violently ſpoiled, they ſtrowed
the ways full of Packs and Fardels, in reſpect of the
covetous deſire they had to things of greater value:
But when they came unto the Women, as their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biliments
were more precious, ſo the more violently
they plucked them away: Their bodies alſo were
not free from their luſt and inforcement; the Camp
every where being full of tumult and lamentation,
as chance befel every one. The licentiouſneſs of the
Victors was ſuch, that their cruelty raged upon all
Ages and Creatures, and no kinde of miſchief was
wanting amongſt them. There might have been
ſeen the variableneſs of Fortune; when they which
had prepared <hi>Darius</hi> Pavilion, did now reſerve and
keep the ſame for <hi>Alexander,</hi> as for their old Maſter:
For the <hi>Macedons</hi> had left that unſpoiled, according
to their Ancient Cuſtom, which are ever wont to
receive their King, when he is Victorious, into the
Kings Pavilion that he hath vanquiſhed.</p>
            <p>The Mother and Wife of <hi>Darius,</hi> that there were
taken Priſoners, moved all men to caſt their eyes
and inward contemplations towards them; whereof
the one deſerved to be Reverenced for the Majeſty
that was in her, and for her Age; and the other for
the excellency of her Beauty, which through her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
was nothing ſtained: She was found im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
her little Son in her arms, not yet of the age
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:46658:40"/>
of ſix years, born as an Inheritour to the Dominion
which his Father had loſt: There lay alſo two young
Virgins in his Grand-mothers lap, even then marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ageable,
who languiſhed and lamented, not ſo much
through their own private ſorrow, as for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorouſneſs
of the old woman. About the mother
and the wife, were a great number of noble Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that pulled their hair and tore their cloaths,
without reſpect of what appertained to their eſtate;
and unmindful of the calamity which <hi>Darius</hi> wife
and his mother were come unto, called them ſtill
by the name of Queens, with ſuch other titles of
honour as they did before. They all forgetting
their own miſery, were diligent to enquire after
the fortune of the field, and what ſucceſs the Battel
had, in which <hi>Darius</hi> was in perſon; for if he were
alive, they could in no wiſe think themſelves Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
But he by the changing of many horſes, was
by that time fled far away.</p>
            <p>There were ſlain of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Army, one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thouſand footmen, and ten thouſand horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
and of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Company, only 504 hurt,
and 32 footmen, and 150 horſemen killed. So great
a Victory was gotten with ſo ſmall a loſs. <hi>Alexander</hi>
that was wearied with purſuing of <hi>Darius,</hi> when
he perceived the night to draw on, and that there
was no hope to overtake him whom he followed,
returned into the <hi>Perſians</hi> Camp, which a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his coming was taken by his men. That night
he made a banquet to ſuch of his friends as he was
accuſtomed to invite; for the hurt on his ſhoulder,
whereof the skin was but ſmally periſhed, did not
hinder him from keeping company. As they ſate
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:46658:40"/>
at meat, ſuddenly they heard a pitiful cry, with
a ſtrange howling and lamentation, that put them
all in great fear; inſomuch that they who kept the
Watch about the Kings Pavilion, fearing it to be the
beginning of ſome great matter, began to arm
themſelves.</p>
            <p>The wife and mother of <hi>Darius,</hi> with the other
Noble women newly taken priſoners, were the
cauſe of this ſudden fear, by lamenting of <hi>Darius,</hi>
whom they ſuppoſed had been ſlain; which ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they conceived by one of the Eunuches, who
ſtanding before their Tent-door, ſaw a Souldier
carry a parcel of <hi>Darius</hi> Diadem, which he a little
before had caſt from his head. When <hi>Alexander</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
their errour, he wept (as it was ſaid) to
conſider <hi>Darius</hi> misfortune, and the womens affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
towards him; and for their comfort ſent to
them one <hi>Mithrenes</hi> that betrayed <hi>Sardis,</hi> who was
expert in the <hi>Perſian</hi> tongue; but yet conſidering
that the ſight of him, being a Traitor, ſhould but
increaſe their ſorrow, he ſent a Noble-man called
<hi>Leonatus,</hi> to declare unto them how they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and that <hi>Darius</hi> was alive. He came towards
the Tent where the women were, with certain
men in Arms, and ſent word before, that he was
come thither from the King: But when ſuch as
ſtood at the Tent-door ſaw armed men approaching,
ſuppoſing their errand had been to murther their
Miſtreſſes, they ran into the place where they were,
and cried out, that their laſt hour was come; for
the men were at hand that were ſent to kill them:
the ſervants therefore, that neither durſt let <hi>Leonatus</hi>
in, nor keep him out, brought him no anſwer, but
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46658:41"/>
remained quietly to ſee what the event would be.
When <hi>Leonatus</hi> had long tarried at the door, and
ſaw none come forth to call him in, he left his men
without, and entred amongſt the Ladies, whoſe
coming unto them, before he was admitted, was
the thing that frighted them moſt of all: The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
therefore and wife of <hi>Darius</hi> fell down at his
feet, requiring him that before they were ſlain he
would ſuffer them to bury <hi>Darius</hi> after his Country
manner; which laſt obſervance performed, they were
content (they ſaid) gladly to ſuffer death <hi>Leonatus</hi>
aſſured them, that both <hi>Darius</hi> was alive, and that
there was no harm meant towards them; but that
they ſhould remain in the ſame eſtate they were in
before. When <hi>Siſygambis</hi> heard thoſe words, ſhe
ſuffered her ſelf to be lifted up from the ground, and
to receive ſome comfort. The next day, <hi>Alexander</hi>
with great diligence, buried the bodies of ſuch of his
men as could be found, and willed the ſame to be
done to the Noble men of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> giving li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe
to <hi>Darius</hi> mother, to bury ſo many as ſhe liſted,
after the cuſtome of her Country. She performed
the ſame to a few that were the neareſt of her kin, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ability of her preſent fortune; for if
ſhe ſhould have uſed the <hi>Perſian</hi> pomp therein,
the <hi>Macedons</hi> might have envied it, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Conquerours, uſed no great curioſity in the
matter.</p>
            <p>When theſe Rites were performed to the dead,
<hi>Alexander</hi> ſignified to the women-priſoners, that he
himſelf would come to viſit them; and cauſing
ſuch as came with him to tarry without, he only
with <hi>Epheſtion</hi> entred in amongſt them. This <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:46658:41"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:46658:42"/>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:46658:42"/>
of all men was moſt dear to <hi>Alexander,</hi> being
brought up as his Companion from his Youth, and
moſt privy with him in all things; there was none
that had ſuch liberty to ſpeak his minde plainly to
the King as he had; which he uſed after ſuch ſort,
that he ſeemed to do it by no Authority, but by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance.
And as he was of like years unto him, ſo
in perſonage he did ſomewhat excel him: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Women thinking <hi>Epheſtion</hi> to be the King,
did fall down and worſhip him (as their Country-manner
was to do to Kings) till ſuch time as one of
the Eunuchs that was taken priſoner, ſhewed them
which of them was <hi>Alexander:</hi> Then <hi>Siſygambis</hi> fell
down at his feet, requiring pardon for her igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
for ſo much as ſhe did never ſee him before:
The King took her up by the hand, and ſaid, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
you be not deceived, for this is</hi> Alexander <hi>alſo:</hi>
Which his humility and continency of minde, if he
had continually obſerved to his latter days, he
might have been thought much more happy then
he was; when he having ſubdued all <hi>Aſia,</hi> from <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſpont</hi>
to the <hi>Ocean Sea,</hi> did counterfeit the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
of <hi>Bacchus:</hi> or if that amongſt the reſt of his
Conqueſts, he would have laboured to conquer his
pride and his wrath, being vices in him invincible;
or if in his drunkenneſs he would have abſtained
from the ſlaughter of his Nobility, and not to have
put to death thoſe excellent Men of War without
judgment, which helped him to conquer ſo many
Nations. But at this time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the greatneſs of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
had not yet altered his Nature, though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he could not bear his Victories with that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
which he did win them, but he behaved himſelf
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:46658:43"/>
after ſuch manner, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e exceeded in Continency
and Compaſſion all the Kings that had been before
his time. He entertained the two Queens, with
thoſe Virgins that were of excellent Beauty, ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently,
as if they had been his Siſters: He not
only abſtained from violation of <hi>Darius</hi> Wife,
which in Beauty excelled all the Women of her
time; but alſo took great care and diligence, that
none other ſhould procure any diſhonour to her:
and to all the women he commanded their orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and apparel to be reſtored; ſo that they
wanted nothing of the magnificence of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Eſtate, ſaving only the aſſured confidence that
Creatures want in miſery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which things conſidered by</hi> Siſygambis, <hi>ſhe ſaid
unto the King:</hi> Sir, your goodneſs towards us doth
deſerve, that we ſhould make the ſame prayer for
you, that we did ſometime for <hi>Darius;</hi> and we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
you worthy to ſurpaſs ſo great a King as he was,
in felicity and good fortune, who do ſo abound in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
and in Clemency. You vouchſafe to call me by the
name of Mother, and of Queen, but I confeſs my ſelf
to be your Hand-maid; for I both conceive the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of my Eſtate paſt, and feel that I can bear this
preſent ſervitude: It lyeth only in your hands how
we ſhall be dealt withal, and whether you will make
us notable to the World, through your Clemency, or
your Cruelty. <hi>The King comforted them all he
might; and willing them to be of good chear,
took</hi> Darius <hi>Son in his arms; at which the Childe
was nothing afraid, having never ſeen him before,
but took and imbraced him about the neck: He
was ſo moved with the conſtancy of the Childe,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:46658:43"/>
that he beheld</hi> Epheſtion, <hi>and ſaid,</hi> Oh that <hi>Darius</hi>
had ſome part of this gentle diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>When he was departed from thence, he cauſed
three Altars to be made upon the River of <hi>Pyramus,</hi>
and there did ſacrifice to <hi>Jupiter, Hercules,</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva,</hi>
and ſo went forwards into <hi>Syria.</hi> He ſent
<hi>Parmenio</hi> before into <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> where <hi>Darius</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
did remain; who underſtanding by the way,
that <hi>Darius</hi> had ſent one of his Nobles thither,
fearing that for the ſmallneſs of his own number,
the Inhabitants of <hi>Dam<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſcus</hi> would keep him out,
he determined to ſend for a greater power: But by
chance one <hi>Mardus</hi> fell into the hands of the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that <hi>Parmenio</hi> had ſent before to ſcour the
Country, who being brought before <hi>Parmenio,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
him the Letters that the Captain of <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
had ſent to <hi>Alexander;</hi> and beſides the Letters,
added of himſelf, that he doubted not but that all
<hi>Darius</hi> riches and his treaſure would be delivered to
him at his arrival. <hi>Parmenio</hi> gave the charge to
certain of his men to ſecure his perſon, and then
opened the Letters, wherein it was contained, that
<hi>Alexander</hi> in all haſte ſhould ſend one of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
thither with a ſmall power: which being
known, he ſent <hi>Mardus</hi> back again to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi>
with a ſmall Guard to accompany him; but he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped
out of their hands, and came to <hi>Damaſcus</hi>
before day-light. That thing troubled <hi>Parmenio</hi>
greatly, doubting that his Enemies had laid an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcado
for him; and therefore he durſt not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
in an unknown way without a Guide:
Notwithſtanding, upon the confidence he had in
the felicity of his Prince, he took ſome Peaſants of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:46658:44"/>
the Country to conduct him the way, who the
fourth day brought him to the City of <hi>Damaſcus.</hi>
The Captain doubting that Credence ſhould not be
given to his Letter, pretended to miſtruſt the
ſtrength of the Town, and made countenance as
though he would fly away. On the break of day he
cauſed <hi>Darius</hi> Treaſure (which the <hi>Perſians</hi> call <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi>)
with the reſt of all his precious things, to be
brought forth of the Town, with a reſolution to
betray the ſame into the <hi>Macedons</hi> hands: There
were many thouſands of men and women that
followed; a pitious ſight to all that ſaw them, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to him to whoſe fideli<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y they were committed:
For he, to win himſelf thanks, purpoſed to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to his Enemies a prey more precious then all
the reſt, which was ſuch of his Nobili<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y as he had
in his cuſtody, with the Wives and Children of
the Great Men that bare Rule under <hi>Darius:</hi> And
beſides, the Embaſſadours of the Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi>
whom <hi>Darius</hi> had left in his treacherous hands, as
in a Fortreſs, to his thinking, of moſt ſecurity. The
<hi>Perſians</hi> call thoſe (<hi>Gargabe</hi>) that carry burthens
upon their ſhoulders, and theſe having the carriage
of things of moſt value, when they could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the Cold for the Froſt and Snow that ſuddenly
fell, they put upon them the Robes of Gold and
Purple, which they carried, together with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
there being no man to let them; for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
of <hi>Darius</hi> cauſed that baſe ſort of men to uſe
a wretched liberty. Thoſe kinde of men ſeemed to
<hi>Parmenio,</hi> at the firſt ſight, to be no ſmall Army; and
therefore weighed not the matter lightly, but gave
Exhortation to thoſe that were with him, as though
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:46658:44"/>
they ſhould have fought a ſore Battel; and willed
them to put their Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Men of War that were with them, by ſuch ways as
they beſt knew: The Captain of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting
ſuch fear as others feared indeed, was the
cauſe of all this confuſion. The riches of <hi>Darius</hi>
were left unguarded, and lay ſcattered abroad over
all the Fields, with the money that was prepared
for the wages of ſo infinite a number of Souldiers;
as alſo the apparel of ſo many great men and Noble
women, with Veſſels and Bridles of Gold, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

full of infinite riches: A thing even ſorrowful to
behold to the Spoilers, if any thing could ſtay the

behold the riches that had been gathered together
in ſo great a number of years, whiles the ſtate of

            </p>
            <p>There was ſcarcely any Houſe of the Nobility of

did perſecute with due puniſhment the Betrayer of

The <hi>Syrians</hi> could not at the firſt bear the new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
becauſe they had not yet felt the Scourge
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46658:46"/>
of the Wars; but as they revolted, they were
ſtraightway ſubdued, performing all that they were
appointed to do. The Iſle of <hi>Arade</hi> was yielded to
<hi>Alexander,</hi> whereof <hi>Strato</hi> was King, that had in
ſubjection all the Sea-coaſt, with divers of the Iſland-Countries;
who being received into truſt, <hi>Alexander</hi>
marched with his Army into the City of <hi>Marathon.</hi>
There he received Letters from <hi>Darius,</hi> that put him
into great choler, becauſe they were ſo arrogantly
written. The ſpecial point that moved <hi>Alexander</hi>
was, for that <hi>Darius</hi> writing himſelf King, did not
vouchſafe to give him that Title, but did write ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by way of Commandment, then of Requeſt;
proffering for the Ranſom of his Wife and Children,
ſo much money as <hi>Macedon</hi> could receive: For the
Government of the Empire (he ſaid) he put it to
his choice, to try it by the Sword if he liſt; but if

content with his own Inheritance, and he would
joyn in Amity with him, and become his Friend; in
which point he was ready to enter into Treaty with

ſubmit thy ſelf, I promiſe thee that I will deliver both
thy Mother, Wife and Children; for I both know how
to get the Victory, and how to uſe ſuch as I Overcome.
But if thou feareſt to commit thy ſelf to us, I will give

Noble young men in that City that had familiarity
with <hi>Epheſtion,</hi> of whom he thought to have choſen
one King; but they refuſed his offer, affirming, that
none might enjoy that Dignity, except he were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
of the Blood Royal. <hi>Epheſtion</hi> wondered
at the magnanimity that was in them, in deſpiſing
the thing that others ſought for by Sword and Fire,
and ſaid, <hi>Continue you ſtill in that vertuous minde,
who are the firſt that have underſtanding, how much
better it is to refuſe, then to receive a Kingdom: Chuſe
you therefore ſuch a one of the Blood Royal, that may
remember he hath received the Rule at your hands.</hi>
But when they ſaw divers gaping for it, and for
the greedineſs they had to Reign, they fell to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
of ſuch as were near to <hi>Alexander;</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
that there was none more fit for that Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
then one <hi>Abdolominus,</hi> who being of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Blood of the Kings, for poverty was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to dwell in a ſmall Graunge without the City:
His honeſty was the cauſe of his poverty (as it is to
many other) and being exerciſed in his daily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
he heard no noyſe of the Wars that troubled
all <hi>Aſia.</hi> They, of whom we ſpake before, came
into his Garden with Garments to apparel him
like a King, and found him weeding of his ground,
whom they ſaluted King, and ſaid, <hi>You muſt make
exchange of the vileneſs of your apparel, with theſe
rich Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es we here preſent you: Waſh thy body that
is now covered with Duſt, and take upon thee the
Heart of a King; and in this Fortune, whereof thou
art worthy, ſhew the ſame moderation and continency
as at this preſent: And when as thou ſhalt ſit in thy
Regal Seat, having in thy hands the power of the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:46658:47"/>
life and death of thy people, do in no wiſe forget the
Eſtate thou wert in when thou took'ſt the Kingdom up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thee, nor yet for what purpoſe thou didſt receive it.</hi>
The matter ſeemed to <hi>Abdolominus</hi> like a Dream,
who asked them if they were mad that would mock
him after that manner? But when he ſaw them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
by Oaths the thing to be in earneſt, he waſhed
himſelf; and receiving the Garment, which was of
Purple and Gold, he went with them into the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.</p>
            <p>The Fame (as it is accuſtomed in ſuch a caſe)
did notably abroad of this ſubject; ſome favoured
the cauſe, and ſome did diſdain it; but ſuch as were
rich, did upbraid his poverty and baſe Eſtate, to ſuch
as were near about <hi>Alexander,</hi> who cauſed the King
to ſend for him; and when he had long beheld his
behaviour, he ſaid: <hi>Your perſonage doth not diſagree
from the Fame of your Linage; but I deſire to know
with what patience you did ſuſtain your poverty: I
would to God</hi> (quoth he) <hi>I could bear my proſperity
in like caſe now, when I am a King: Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe hands did
get that I deſired; and having nothing, I lacked no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
His words cauſed <hi>Alexander</hi> to conceive of
him a marvellous good Opinion; ſo that he gave
unto him, not only the riches, ſtuff, and furniture
appertaining to the King before, but alſo many
things that were taken from the <hi>Perſians;</hi> adding to
his Dominion, all the Country near about that
City.</p>
            <p>In the mean ſeaſon, <hi>Amintas,</hi> who heretofore fled
from <hi>Alexander</hi> to <hi>Darius,</hi> and now he eſcaped in
the laſt Battel, did come to <hi>Tripolis</hi> with four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<hi>Greeks;</hi> where he imbarqued, and ſailed to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:46658:48"/>
               <hi>Cyprus;</hi> thinking the World to be ſuch then, that
every one might enjoy what he could get, as if it
had been his own Inheritance. His purpoſe was to
go into <hi>Egypt,</hi> thinking there to become an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
both to <hi>Darius,</hi> and to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with the world, according as time ſhould ſerve.
To bring therefore his Souldiers to think well of his
Enterprize, he declared how the Governour of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi>
was ſlain in the Battel, and that the <hi>Perſians</hi>
left there in Garriſon were but a ſmall number, of
little force, and without any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>: He ſhewed how
the <hi>Egyptians</hi> uſed to Rebel againſt their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours;
wherefore they were ſure to be received as
Friends: <hi>For neceſſity</hi> (quoth he) <hi>hath inforced us to
prove our Fortunes, which failing us in our firſt hope,
we muſt now conceive that the time to come ſhall be
much better then the Fortunes we now enjoy.</hi> They
all agreed with one voice, that he ſhould lead them
where he pleaſed: Whereupon, thinking not good
to pretermit the occaſion, whiles they were high
with hopes, he conveyed them to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
the Haven at <hi>Peluſium,</hi> under pretence that
he had been ſent thither by <hi>Darius.</hi> When he had
got <hi>Peluſium,</hi> he ſet forwards towards <hi>Memphis;</hi>
at the Fame of whoſe coming, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> being
a light Nation, and more apt to raiſe a Coil, then
to maintain it when it was once begun, ran to him
out of all their Towns and Villages, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to deſtroy all the <hi>Perſians;</hi> who notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fear they were in, did not leave the defence
of the Country, but fought with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and
were put to flight.</p>
            <p>After this Victory, <hi>Amintas</hi> beſieged <hi>Memphis,</hi> and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:46658:48"/>
his men deſtroyed ſo all the Country thereabouts,
that they left nothing unſpoiled: Whereupon, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeches,</hi>
though he perceived his men much amazed
with the fear of their late overthrow; yet when he
ſaw his Enemies ſcattered abroad, and without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
being overcome with ſecurity, and the pride
of their late Victory, he at length perſwaded his
men to iſſue out of the City; and in ſetting upon
their Enemies, to recover again what they had loſt:
Which advice being good of it ſelf, being tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
followed, took moſt fortunate ſucceſs; for
they ſlew at that time both <hi>Amintas</hi> and all his
company. This puniſhment he ſuffered for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
committed to both Princes, being neither
faithful to <hi>Alexander</hi> whom he forſook, nor to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
to whom he fled. <hi>Darius</hi> Captains who eſcaped
from the Battel of <hi>Iſſum,</hi> gathering together ſuch
men as were ſcattered abroad, and ſuch power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
as they could levy in <hi>Cappadocia</hi> and <hi>Paphlago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
did attempt to recover again the Country of
<hi>Lydia. Antigonus</hi> was Governour for <hi>Alexander</hi>
there, who notwithſtanding that he had taken ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Souldiers out of the Garriſons of <hi>Alexander,</hi> yet
he ſo little eſteemed his Enemies, that he doubted
not to adventure the Battel. The <hi>Perſians</hi> there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the like Fortune they did in other places, and
attempting the Fight in three ſundry Countries,
were vanquiſhed in them all.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time, the Navy of the <hi>Macedons</hi>
which <hi>Alexander</hi> had ſent for out of <hi>Greece,</hi> meeting
<hi>Ariſtimones,</hi> (whom <hi>Darius</hi> had appointed to make
War upon the Coaſt of <hi>Helleſpont</hi>) ſought with, and
drowned all his Ships. <hi>Pharnabaſus, Darius</hi> having
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:46658:49"/>
exacted money of the <hi>Miſonians,</hi> and put a Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in <hi>Scios,</hi> paſſed into the Iſle of <hi>Andros</hi> with a
hundred Ships, and from thence he ſailed to <hi>Shiph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi>
and putting Men of War into all the Iſlands,
exacted of them money. The greatneſs of the War
that was in hand between two of the moſt puiſſant
Princes of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> did draw both <hi>Greece</hi>
and <hi>Creet</hi> to Arms: <hi>Agis,</hi> the King of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi>
gathered together eight-thouſand <hi>Greeks</hi> that were
come home out of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and moved War againſt
<hi>Antipater</hi> that was Governour of <hi>Macedonia.</hi> The
<hi>Cretians</hi> following ſometime one part, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
another, received one while a Garriſon of
<hi>Macedons,</hi> and another while of <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> to
lye amongſt them. But thoſe Wars were of no great
importance, for all mens eyes were fixed upon the
Wars that were between <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Darius,</hi>
whereupon all the reſt did depend.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Macedons</hi> had ſubdued all <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Phenice,
Tyre</hi> only excepted; which being the greateſt and
moſt notable City of all that Country, ſhewed that
they eſteemed themſelves worthy rather to joyn
with <hi>Alexander</hi> as Friends, then to become his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
for when he was come near unto them, and
incamped upon the main Land, which is divided
from their City with a ſmall Arm of the Sea, they
ſent to him, by their Embaſſadours, a Crown of
Gold for a Preſent, with great plenty beſides of
victuals for his Army: He received their Gifts as
from his Friends, and gave gentle Anſwers unto the
Embaſſadours; but he ſhewed himſelf much deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to make Sacrifice unto <hi>Hercules,</hi> (whom the
<hi>Tyrians</hi> ſpecially worſhipped, and the <hi>Macedon</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:46658:49"/>
Kings ſuppoſed themſelves to be deſcended of him)
being admoniſhed (as he ſaid) by an Oracle. The
Embaſſadours made anſwer, <hi>That there was a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of</hi> Hercules <hi>without their City, in the place which
they call</hi> Palaetiron, <hi>whereas he might do Sacrifice
at pleaſure.</hi> At thoſe words <hi>Alexander</hi> could not
refrain from anger, whereunto he was much ſubject,
but fell in a great paſſion.</p>
            <p>I perceive now (<hi>quoth he</hi>) becauſe ye dwell in an
Iſland, ye truſt ſo much in the ſcituation of your City,
that ye deſpiſe my Land power: But I will ſhortly
make you underſtand, that you are ſcituated upon the
Main Land; and therefore truſt to it, that if ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
me not in, I will enter into your City by force.</p>
            <p>When the Embaſſadours were diſmiſſed with this
anſwer, ſuch as were near about the King, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
them that they ſhould not exclude him
whom all <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Phenicia</hi> had received: But
they had entertained ſuch a confidence, for that
their City ſtood in the Sea, being divided eighty
furlongs from the Main Land, that they abſolutely
determined to abide the Siege.</p>
            <p>That Sea of theirs is much ſubject to the <hi>South-Weſt</hi>-winde;
which at every Storm made the Waves
beat ſo high againſt the ſhore, that it would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the <hi>Macedons</hi> to make any work for the uniting
the Main Land to the City, it being ſcarce poſſible
to work any thing there when the weather was moſt
calm. The firſt work that the <hi>Macedons</hi> began,
was by and by thrown down with the vehemency of
the Seas that were driven by the winde; nor could
they make any Fort ſo ſtrong within the Sea, but
that it was waſhed away, and brought down by
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:46658:50"/>
beating of the Waves; and when the Windes blew
violently, they would bring the Seas clean over the
work. There was another difficulty no leſs then
this; for by reaſon that the Walls were environed
about with the deepneſs of the Sea, they could raiſe
no Engine to ſhoot, but afar off out of the Ships;
nor was there any ground about the City, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Ladders might have been reared againſt the
walls, or approach made unto them by Land. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
had no Ships; and if he had any, and
would have coveted to bring them to the walls, yet
by reaſon of the unſtableneſs of the water, they
might with ſhot eaſily have been kept off. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
many other things, the <hi>Tyrians</hi> were
wonderfully encouraged by the coming of the
Embaſſadours, ſent from <hi>Carthage</hi> to celebrate a
yearly ſacrifice: for the <hi>Tyrians</hi> being the builders
of <hi>Carthage,</hi> were ever ſince that time had in Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of them, as their Parents and firſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
Thoſe Embaſſadours exhorted them in any
wiſe to continue the Siege, and promiſed them
ſhortly aid; which thing they alledged might eaſily
and ſoon be done, for ſo much as at that time all
the Seas were full of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> ſhips. Upon
this encouragement, they determined to abide the
extremity, and placed their Engines upon the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and walls, dividing their Engines amongſt
the Youth of the City. The Artificers, whereof
the City had gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t plenty, were divided into Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes,
to make all ſuch things as were neceſſary
for the Wars: There were deviſed certain Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
wherewith they might pull down the Works
that their Enemies made, called <hi>Harpagons;</hi> and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:46658:50"/>
alſo Crows of Iron, named <hi>Corvi,</hi> with all other
things that might be invented for the defence of
the City. But a ſtrange thing is reported, that
when the Iron was put in the Forge, and blown in
the Fire, the ſame was ſeen to be full of drops of
blood: which Wonder, the <hi>Tyrians</hi> did interpret
as a token of good Fortune towards themſelves, and
as a ſignification of deſtruction towards their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
A like wonder was ſeen among the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns;</hi>
for when a certain Souldier was breaking of
his bread, drops of blood appeared therein: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
<hi>Alexander</hi> being aſtonied, <hi>Ariſtander,</hi> that was
moſt cunning of all the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>viners, did interpret
thus the matter: <hi>If the blood had appeared outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
then it had ſignified evil fortune to the</hi> Macedons;
<hi>but in as much as it was found within, it betokened
deſtruction to the City they went about to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> conſidering his N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>vy to be far from
him, and that a long Siege ſhould be an impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to his other affairs, ſent Officers of Arms into
the City, to perſwade them unto peace; whom the

the Sea. Their u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>uſt death ſtirred <hi>Alexander</hi> ſo
much, that he then utterly determined to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
with the Siege: But before he could make
his approach, it was of neceſſity for him to make a
Peer or Land-work, whereby they might paſs from
the main Land to the City: But in the making
thereof, there entred great deſpair into all mens
hearts, conſidering the deepneſs of the Sea, which
they ſaw not po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le to be filled ſcarcely by any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
power; for they thought no Stones ſo great, no
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:46658:51"/>
Trees ſo high, nor any Country to have ſuch plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as might ſuffice for the building of a Bank in
ſuch a place, conſidering the Sea remained always
troubled; and the narrower the place was between
the City and the Land, ſo much more greater was
the violence of the waters. But <hi>Alexander,</hi> who had
the policy to allure his Souldiers to what effect he
pleaſed, declared that <hi>Hercules</hi> appeared unto him
in his ſleep, and gave him his hand, proffering him
to be his Captain and his Guide for his entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the City: Thereunto he added the killing of his
Embaſſadours, whereby they had violated and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Law that all Nations obſerved, and that
there remained but one City which ſtayed his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory:
thereupon he divided the work amongſt his
Captains, that every one might apply his own
Band, and put the work more forward.</p>
            <p>There were great plenty of ſtones at hand of the
ruines of the old City where <hi>Tyre</hi> ſtood before; and
for the making of Boats and Towers, Timber was
brought from Mount <hi>Libanus:</hi> The work did riſe
from the bottom of the Sea like a Mountain, but it
was not yet brought to the High-water mark; and
the further the Peer was brought from the Land un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Seaward, ſo much the ſooner the Sea did
ſwallow up the materials whereof the Peer was
made. Whiles the <hi>Macedons</hi> were thus about their
work, the <hi>Tyrians</hi> would come about them in ſmall
Veſſels, and give them words of reproach and ſcorn;
as, they were now become goodly Men of War, that
would be made Pioniers, and carry burthens upon
their backs: And they asked them, if they thought
<hi>Alexander</hi> to be greater then the god of the Sea?
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:46658:51"/>
But their reproach did not hinder, but increaſe the
chearfulneſs of the Souldiers in their pain and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel;
inſomuch, that the work in a ſhort ſpace ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
above the water, and increaſing much in
breadth, approached near unto the City: Then
the <hi>Tyrians</hi> ſeeing the hugeneſs of the work, in the
increaſe whereof they ſaw themſelves deceived, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
thinking that it would have grown to ſuch a
paſs, in little Veſſels came rowing about the Peer,
and drove the Souldiers with ſhot from their work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and becauſe they could eaſily bring their Boats
ſuddenly forwards, return ſoon again, they hurt
many of the <hi>Macedons,</hi> without any danger to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
inforcing them to leave their work, and fall
to their own defence: For remedy whereof, and
to avoid their Enemies ſhot, they were compelled
to ſtretch out Beaſts skins upon Poles, like Sails,
and ſet thoſe between them and their Enemies: and
beſides, at the head of the Peer they raiſed up two
Towers, from whence with ſhot, and caſting of
Darts, they kept off the Boats that came about
them.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, the <hi>Tyrians</hi> would land men
with their Boats far out of the ſight of the Camp,
and kill ſuch as were carrying of ſtones. The Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants
of <hi>Arabia</hi> alſo did ſet upon certain of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedons</hi>
that were ſcattered abroad in Mount <hi>Liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
where they ſlew and took divers? that was one
cauſe which moved <hi>Alexander</hi> to divide his Army;
and leſt he might ſeem to remain idle about the
Siege of one City, he appointed <hi>Perdicas</hi> and <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus</hi>
to take the charge of the work he had in hand,
and marched himſelf in perſon into <hi>Arabia,</hi> with
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:46658:52"/>
ſuch part of his power, as was moſt apt for his
preſent purpoſe. In the mean ſeaſon, the <hi>Tyrians</hi>
prepared a great ſhip, laden with ſtones and gravel
behinde, ſo that the fore-part ſloated above the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
which ſhip anointed over with pitch and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
they brought ſuddenly, by ſailing and force
of Oars, unto the Peer; and there remaining, the
Marriners ſet the ſhip on fire, and then leaped into
the Boats, which followed after to receive them.
The ſhip thus ſet on fire, ſo inflamed the Wood-work
pertaining to the Peer, that before any reſcue
could come, the fire had taken the Towers of the
Peer, and all the reſt of the Works that were made
in the head. When they, who leaped into the Boats,
ſaw the matter take ſuch effect, they put betwixt
the Timber, and other void places, both Fire-brands,
and all ſuch things as might give nouriſhment and
increaſe to the fire: So that the Towers, and all the
reſt, being on a flame, many of the <hi>Macedons</hi> were
conſumed therewith; and the reſt forſook their
Arms, and threw themſelves into the Sea. The <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>
that were more deſirous to take them alive,
then to kill them with ſtaves and ſtones, did ſo beat
them on the hands as they were ſwimming, that
for wearineſs they were glad to be taken up into
their Boats. The Towers were not conſumed with
fire only; for it chanced alſo the ſame day a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
winde to riſe, which blowing from the Sea,
brought the Waves with ſuch violence upon the
Peer, that with often beating of the Seas, the joynts
that knit the work together, began to looſe and to
leave their hold: then the water that waſhed
through, brake down the whole work in the midſt;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:46658:52"/>
ſo that the heaps of ſtones which were before ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained
by the Timber and Farth caſt betwixt them,
being broke aſunder, the whole work fell to ruine,
and were carried away into the Deep.</p>
            <p>By that time <hi>Alexander</hi> was returned out of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia,</hi>
and ſcarcely found any remainder or token,
that any ſuch work had been. In that caſe (as it is
ever uſed in things that chance evil) one laid the
fault upon another, when indeed, the violence of
the Sea was the cauſe of all. <hi>Alexander</hi> began to
make the Peer again after a new manner; the head
therefore lying into the weather and the winde, and
not the open ſide, as it did before; ſo that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
always defended the reſt of the work lying
behinde. He increaſed alſo the breadth thereof, to
the intent the Towers might be builded in the
midſt of the Peer, whereby they ſhould be leſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the Enemies ſhot: whole Trees were put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sea, with their tops and branches, and after,
great ſtones were thrown upon them; and over
thoſe a new courſe of ſtone and trees, and ſtone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
by which device this whole work was joyned
and faſtned all into one.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Macedons</hi> were buſie to bring their work
forwards, ſo the <hi>Tyrians</hi> were as diligent to invent
all ſuch things, as might give impediment to their
proceeding. The chief practice was, for a great
number or them to enter into the Sea coaſt, afar off,
out of the <hi>Macedons</hi> ſight, and ſo come diving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the water, till they came unto the Peer; where
with Hooks they would pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſubſtance followed after into the deep: For the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:46658:53"/>
Trees being diſcharged of their burthens, were eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
drawn away; and then the Foundation failing,
the whole Work, that ſtayed upon the Trees, fell to
ruine. Amongſt theſe impediments, <hi>Alexander</hi> ſtood
in great perplexity of minde, doubting whether he
ſhould continue the Siege ſtill, or elſe depart his
way. When he was in this imagination, ſuddenly
his Navy arrived to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Cleander</hi> alſo with
his Souldiers which he had brought out of <hi>Greece:</hi>
And having to the number of 180 Ships, divided
them into two Squadrons; whereof he committed
the one unto <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> the King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and to
<hi>Craterus,</hi> and took charge of the other himſelf;
committing his own perſon to a Gallery called
<hi>Cinquereme,</hi> which had five Oars on a ſide. The
<hi>Tyrians</hi> durſt not adventure the Sea-fight, although
they had a great Navy, but ſet all their Galleys in
a Front before the Walls of the City, which the
King aſſailed, and put to diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>The next day, the <hi>Macedons,</hi> with their ſhips, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed
the City round about, and did beat down
the Walls, eſpecially with ſuch Engines as they call
<hi>Rams;</hi> but the <hi>Tyrians</hi> ſtraightway inforced, and
made up their Walls with ſtones that lay at hand,
and raiſed up an inward Wall round about the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which might be their defence if the other fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
But their deſtruction approached on every
ſide; the Work was now wrought within the caſt
of a Dart, and the Ships gave the approach round
about the Walls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that they were over-laid both
by Sea and Land: The <hi>Macedons</hi> had deviſed to
joyn their Galleys, two and two together, in ſuch
ſort, that the fore-parts met cloſe before, and the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:46658:53"/>
hinder parts lay far off one from the other; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the ſpaces remaining betwixt Poop and Poop,
they made Bridges, with Maſts and Main-yards
layed betwixt Galley and Galley, faſt bound toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to carry Souldiers upon. When they h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d put
their Galleys in this order, they ſet forwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the City; and having rampired the Sterns
for defence of the Souldiers that were behinde, they
ſtood in their Galleys, and did ſhoot and caſt Darts
againſt their Enemies, without any peril or danger
to themſelves. It was Mid-night when they had
Commandment to ſet forwards, after this manner;
as the Ships were approaching on all parts, and the
<hi>Tyrians</hi> ſtood aſtonied for fear and deſperation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
the Sky was overwhelmed with dim Clouds,
and a ſudden darkneſs took away the light: Then
the Sea, by little and little, waxed terrible and
rough; the Winde blew, raiſing the Waves, which
did beat the Ships one againſt another; the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
whereof, burſt aſunder the Bands and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers
wherewith the Galleys were faſtened together:
Which done, the Bridges craſhed, and flew aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
and with the Souldiers that ſtood upon them,
fell into the Sea. There was great confuſion; for
the Ships entangled thus together, could by no
means be governed in ſuch a Tempeſt; the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
diſturbing the feat of the Marriners, and the
Marriners giving impediment to the Office of the
Souldiers.</p>
            <p>Thus (as it doth often happen in ſuch a caſe)
the expert were obedient to the ignorant; for the
Ship-Maſters that were accuſtomed to Command,
for fear of death, were directed by others. But at
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:46658:54"/>
length, by force of Rowing, the Galleys recovered
the ſhore, the greater part of them being broken
and torn. It chanced, at the ſame time, thirty Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
to come from <hi>Carthage</hi> to <hi>Tyre,</hi> who gave
more comfort then aſſiſtance to them that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged:
For they ſhewed how the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
were ſo aſſailed with Wars at their own doors, that
they could by no means ſend them ſuccour; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that the <hi>Syracuſans</hi> were deſtroying <hi>Africa</hi>
with Fire and Sword, and had incamped themſelves
under the very walls of <hi>Carthage.</hi> The <hi>Tyrians</hi> yet
were not diſcomfited, for all that they were diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
of their ſpecial truſt; but delivered unto
thoſe Embaſſadours their Wives and their Children,
to carry unto <hi>Carthage,</hi> thinking to continue the
Siege with greater reſolution, if the things which
were moſt dear unto them were removed out of
danger.</p>
            <p>There was a <hi>Tyrian,</hi> who in an open Aſſembly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
that <hi>Apollo</hi> (whom the <hi>Tyriars</hi> greatly do
worſhip) had appeared to him in his ſleep, and
declared to him, that he had forſaken the City, and
transformed the work that the <hi>Macedons</hi> had made,
into a great Wood. Hereupon, though the Author
were of ſmall credit; yet for as much as men in fear
are apt to believe the worſt, they tyed <hi>Apollo</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Image
with a Golden Chain, and bound faſt alſo the Altar
of <hi>Hercules,</hi> (to whom the City was dedicate) think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by detaining of the one, to keep ſafe the other.
The <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> in times paſt, had brought that
Image from <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and had placed it in the head-City,
out of the which they were deſcended: For
their cuſtom was to adorn <hi>Tyre</hi> with ſuch ſpoils as
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:46658:54"/>
they had taken, no leſs then they did <hi>Carthage</hi> it
ſelf. They, at that time, would alſo have been Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
unto the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> for the renewing of an old
ſacrifice that had been omitted many years, wherein
they uſed to offer up to <hi>Saturn</hi> a free-born childe;
which being rather a ſacriledge then a ſacrifice, the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> received from their firſt Founders, and
ſtill obſerved the ſame, till they were deſtroyed: and
had not the Ancient Men, by whom all things were
governed, withſtood it, this wicked Superſtition
had taken place, which Nature and Humanity doth
abhor: The neceſſity that was hanging over their
heads, being more effectual then any Art or Science,
practiſed not only ſuch things as were accuſtomed
for defences, but alſo found out what was never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
before: For to the diſturbance of the ſhips
that approached the Walls, they deviſed long Raf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
to the which they faſtened grapp'es of Iron,
and great hooks like Sythes; which let down with
Ropes by an Engine, either did tear the ſhips, or
deſtroyed the men. They invented alſo Targets or
Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tle to be made fire-hot, in the which they put
burning Sand, and ſcalding Lime, and then poured
the ſame upon the <hi>Macedons</hi> that came near to the
Walls, being a miſchief that they feared moſt of all
other: For when the hot Sand entred between the
Harneſs and the body, there was no means to avoid
it; and where it touched, it burned to the bones; ſo
that they were forced to throw away their Harneſs,
and tear away all things they had upon their bodies;
thereby they became ſubject to be hurt by their E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and were not in caſe to indamage them again:
But ſpecially the Grapplers that were let down
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:46658:55"/>
(called <hi>Corvi</hi>) took violently away many of the
Souldiers that were within the ſhips. <hi>Alexander</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the obſtinate defence of the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> was weary
of the Siege, and determined to raiſe it, and to go
unto <hi>Egypt:</hi> For conſidering in how ſhort a ſpace
he ſubdued <hi>Aſia,</hi> it grieved him to be detained ſo
long about the Walls of one City, whereby he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the occaſion and opportunity of greater
Conqueſts. But he was as much aſhamed to depart
without his purpoſe, as to continue there, and leave
other things undone; judging, that if he ſhould
leave <hi>Tyre</hi> in that ſort as a witneſs that he might be
withſtood, it ſhould much impair his Fame, by
which he had gotten more then by force: And it
chanced at the ſame time, a Monſter of an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bigneſs did appear, as well in the ſight of the
<hi>Tyrians,</hi> as the <hi>Macedons;</hi> which lying upon his back
above the water, came towards the Peer; and when
he had lifted up himſelf at the head of the Peer, it
dived under the water again; and ſometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
above, and ſometimes hiding himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath,
when it came near the walls of the City,
it vaniſhed out of ſight.</p>
            <p>The ſight of this Monſter rejoyced both parties,
the <hi>Macedons</hi> interpreting the ſame to be ſent them
as a Guide for their direction to finiſh the work:
And the <hi>Tyrians</hi> divining, that <hi>Neptune,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging
the uſurpations that the <hi>Macedons</hi> had
made upon the Sea, would ſhortly deſtroy the
work that they had made, in ſuch like ſort as he had
taken away the Monſter. They, upon their own i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination,
conceived ſuch a gladneſs, and prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticated
to themſelves ſuch good Fortune, that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:46658:55"/>
they fell to banqueting and drinking; and when
they were well charged with Wine, at the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing,
they put Garlands of Flowers upon their
heads, and mounted into Galleys, not only with
hope of Victory, but with a Triumph made before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand.
It chanced at the ſame time, that <hi>Alexander</hi>
had conveyed his Navy to the contrary ſide of the
City, and left upon the ſhore thirty of the ſmalleſt
Veſſels, of the which the <hi>Tyrians</hi> took two, and
put the reſt in danger of diſtreſs, until ſuch time as
the King hearing the Alarm, ſet forwards with his
Navy towards that part where the cry was heard.
The firſt Galley of the <hi>Macedons</hi> that came near
them was a <hi>Cinquereme,</hi> the ſwi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>teſt of all the reſt;
which when the <hi>Tyrians</hi> eſpied, they came againſt
her with two Galleys croſs upon her ſide; whereof
the one ſtruck at her full with her Spurn, with
whom the <hi>Cinquereme</hi> grappled; and the other,
which was looſe and at liberty, fell upon her on the
contrary ſide. But leſt between them two ſhe
might ſuſtain ſome damage, one of <hi>Alexanders
Trirems</hi> came to the reſcue, with ſuch violence, that
the Maſter of the looſe Galley was ſtruck into the
Sea. When the <hi>Tyrians</hi> ſaw that <hi>Alexander</hi> was
come himſelf, and more of his ſhips at hand, with
ſtrength of Oars, and great induſtry, they ſet their
Galleys that were intangled looſe again, and at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
making towards their Haven with all the
haſte they could: <hi>Alexander</hi> immediately purſued
them; but when he came to the Haven he could
not enter, but was beaten off with ſhot from the
walls, yet did he take and drown the moſt part of
their Galleys. After this Adventure, he reſted his
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:46658:56"/>
Souldiers two days, and then commanded his ſhips
to be brought forwards, and the Engines in them;
to the intent, that by aſſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ing the <hi>Tyrians</hi> on all
ſides, he might put them into an extreme fear. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
with a wonderful courage, not without
great peril of his perſon, mounted up into the
top of a Tower that was made in a Ship, and there
known by his apparel and rich Armour, was chiefly
aſſaulted, and ſhot on from all parts. He wrought
wonderful feats with his own perſon; for both with
his Pike he ſlew divers that ſtood at defence, and
afterwards he fought hand to hand, with his Sword
and Target, throwing divers down from their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
for the Tower wherein he fought joyned
hard to the Walls.</p>
            <p>By that time the Engines, called <hi>Rams,</hi> with
much beating, having laid low the Walls, the Navy
was got within the Haven, and certain of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedons</hi>
had won the Towers: The <hi>Tyrians</hi> then op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
with ſo many miſeries at once, were clean
diſcomfited; ſome fled unto the Temples for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour;
ſome did ſhut their doors, taking that kinde
of death they liked beſt; and others ran upon their
Enemies, to ſell their lives at the deareſt rate: but
the moſt part got up into the tops of their houſes,
and from thence did caſt down upon their Enemies,
whatſoever came unto their hands. <hi>Alexander</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
all to be ſlain without exception, ſaving
ſuch as fled into the Temples, and willed all the
houſes to be ſet on fire. Though Proclamation
thereof was made through the City, yet the <hi>Tyrians</hi>
that bore Arms could not ſave themſelves; for as
the women and Children filled the Temples, ſo the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:46658:56"/>
men kept the Entries of their houſes, ready to abide
the cruelty of their enemies: Yet the <hi>Sydonians</hi> were
the occaſion that many were ſaved, who ſerving
in the Garriſon of the <hi>Macedons,</hi> and entring the
City with them, were mindful of their Affinity with
the <hi>Tyrians (Agenor</hi> being the Builder of both their
Cities) and conveyed many into their ſhips, which
they privately ſent unto <hi>Sydon;</hi> by that means fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
thouſand eſcaped the cruelty of the Sword.
The number of them that were ſlain may partly be
conjectured, in that there were found dead within
the City, ſix thouſand of ſuch as did bear Arms.
The Kings anger againſt the City made the ſight
dolorous even unto the Conquerours: For 2000,
whom the fury of the ſlaughter had left alive, were
afterwards hanged upon Croſſes all along the Sea-Coaſt.
The Embaſſadours of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were
ſaved; but War was threatned to be made againſt
them, from the which he was then hindred by other
buſineſs he had in hand.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Tyre</hi> was taken the ſeventh moneth after it
was beſieged; a City notable to Poſterity, as well
through the antiquity thereof, as by the often change
of Fortune it had ſuffered. It was builded by <hi>Agenor,</hi>
and many years was Miſtreſs of the Seas, not only
thereabouts, but in all places where their Navies were
heard of; and if we may credit Fame, that City
was the firſt which either taught or learned letters.
They builded Cities, and filled them with Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
throughout the greateſt part of the world; as
<hi>Carthage</hi> in <hi>Africk, Thebes</hi> in <hi>Boetia,</hi> and <hi>Cades</hi> in
<hi>Spain,</hi> upon the Ocean. It is believed, that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of their free courſe through all Seas, and by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:46658:57"/>
many ſtrange Countries, they had occaſion
to look out Seats in which to place their Youth,
wherewith they then abounded; or elſe, as ſome
report, the Inhabitants unwilling to dwell there, by
reaſon of many Earth-quakes, were compelled, by
force of Arms, to ſeek out new dwelling places. But
when many caſualties had happened unto <hi>Tyre,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this deſtruction being reſtored to its former
height of flouriſh, it now remaineth under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Clemency. About the ſame
time <hi>Alexander</hi> received Letters from <hi>Darius,</hi>
wherein at laſt he was contented to name him
King.</p>
            <p>His requeſt was, that <hi>Alexander</hi> would receive his
Daughter <hi>Saptina</hi> for his Wife, with whom he offered
in Dower, all the Country between <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> and
the River of <hi>Alys,</hi> would reſerve unto himſelf only
ſuch Kingdoms as lay from thence Eaſtward; and if
peradventure he ſhould refuſe to receive this offer, he
willed to conſider, that Fortune is not wont to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
long in one Eſtate, and that the greater felicity
men enjoy, the greater envy doth attend them. It was
to be doubted (<hi>he ſaid</hi>) leſt he exalted himſelf through
ſome vain affection, like as Birds uſe to do, whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
lightneſs doth convey them to the Stars: for
there was nothing more difficult, then in ſuch young
years, to bear well the height and greatneſs of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
He willed him alſo to conſider, that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
yet many Countries that he had not touched,
and that he ſhould not meet him always in the
<hi>Streights,</hi> having to paſs the River of <hi>Euphrates,
Tygre, Araxes,</hi> and <hi>Hydaſpes,</hi> which were as Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks
unto his Dominion; and when he ſhould come
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:46658:57"/>
unto the Plains, he would be aſhamed of his ſmall
number. He put him in remembrance, how long it
ſhould be e're he could paſs <hi>Media, Hircania, Bactria,</hi>
and the <hi>Indians</hi> that bordered on the Ocean Sea; and
likewiſe the <hi>Sogdians</hi> and <hi>Arachoſians,</hi> of whom men
have no other knowledge, then of their names only,
with other Nations lying towards Mount <hi>Caucaſus,</hi>
and the River of <hi>Tanais.</hi> And although no man
ſhould withſtand him, or give him Battel, yet he
ſhould grow in age (<hi>he ſaid</hi>) before he could paſs ſo
many Lands. In the latter end, he adviſed him not
to call him forwards, for he would come ſoon enough to
his deſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> made anſwer to thoſe Letters by the
Meſſengers that brought them, to this effect:</p>
            <p>That <hi>Darius</hi> offered to him <hi>that</hi> which was none of
his own, and made a proffer to give <hi>that</hi> which he had
already loſt. For <hi>Lydia, Ionia, Aeolida,</hi> and the Coaſt
of <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> which he appointed in Dower, were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
become the Rewards of his Victory: And as for
Laws and Conditions, thoſe were wont to be given
and appointed by the Victors, and received of ſuch as
were overcome; and if he were ignorant in which of
thoſe two Eſtates he were, that he ſhould adventure
the Battel once again: For he was not ignorant, <hi>he
ſaid,</hi> before he paſſed the Sea, how <hi>Lydia</hi> and <hi>Cilicia</hi>
were over ſmall rewards for the making of ſuch a
War. But his determination was to ſubdue and bring
under his ſubjection, both <hi>Perſepolis,</hi> the chief City of
his Empire, and alſo <hi>Bactria,</hi> and <hi>Ecbatana,</hi> with the
uttermoſt bounds of the Orient: He could fly no where
but he was able to follow; and therefore counſelled
him, that he ſhould not fright him with Rivers, who
had learned how to paſs Seas.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:46658:58"/>
Thus the Kings wrote one to another; and in
the mean ſeaſon the <hi>Rhodians</hi> yeilded their City and
their Haven unto <hi>Alexander,</hi> who committed the
Rule of <hi>Cilicia</hi> unto <hi>Socrates,</hi> and the Country about
<hi>Tyre</hi> unto <hi>Philotas. Andromachus</hi> was made <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menio</hi>
his Deputy in <hi>Caria</hi> and <hi>Syria;</hi> for <hi>Alexander</hi>
minding to accompliſh what he had begun, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<hi>Epheſtion,</hi> that with his Navy he ſhould ſail
along the Coaſt of <hi>Phenicia;</hi> and ſo he came with
his whole power to the City of <hi>Gaza.</hi> About the
ſame time there were ſolemn Triumphs and Plays
at <hi>Iſthmos,</hi> accuſtomed to be celebrated by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of all <hi>Greece.</hi> In this a Councel was had, and
(as the Wits of the <hi>Greeks</hi> be ſudden) they decreed
to ſend twelve Embaſſadours unto <hi>Alexander,</hi> for
the carrying unto him a Crown of Gold, in grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the Victory he had won, and the Acts he had
done for the ſafeguard and Liberties of <hi>Greece;</hi> and
yet a little before they hearkned how the Fame
went, and were ready to bend that way that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
inclined. <hi>Alexander</hi> viſited not in perſon all
ſuch Countries and Cities as refuſed to do their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
unto him, but made Conqueſt of them by his
Deputies; for <hi>Gales</hi> Maſtered <hi>Paphlagonia, Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Liconia,</hi> and <hi>Balachrus</hi> overcame <hi>Idarne,</hi> who
was <hi>Darius</hi> Lieutenant, and won <hi>Miletu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>: Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus</hi>
and <hi>Egilachus,</hi> with a Navy of an hundred and

<hi>Perſians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They were at the point to have gotten <hi>Scios,</hi> but
that <hi>Pharnabaſus, Darius</hi> Deputy, having intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:46658:58"/>
of it, did firſt apprehend all ſuch as were of
the <hi>Macedons</hi> Faction, and committed the City with
a ſmall Garriſon to <hi>Apolonides</hi> and <hi>Athenagoras,</hi> that
were inclined to the <hi>Perſians. Alexanders</hi> Captains
for all this continued the Siege of the City, not ſo
much in truſt of their own ſtrength, as in hope of
the Faction they had within the City; in which they
were not deceived: For through a Sedition which
did ariſe between <hi>Apolonides,</hi> and the Captains of the
Men of War, occaſion was miniſtred unto the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedons</hi>
to enter the Town. When the Gate was
broken up, and a Band of <hi>Macedons</hi> entred, then
the Citizens, which before had deviſed to Rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Perſians,</hi> took part with <hi>Amphiterus</hi> and
<hi>Egilocus;</hi> ſo that the Garriſon of the <hi>Perſians</hi> were
ſlain, and <hi>Pharnabaſus,</hi> with <hi>Apolonides</hi> and <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagoras,</hi>
taken priſoners.</p>
            <p>There were twelve Galleys taken, with their
Souldiers and Rowers, beſides thirty Ships and Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
of Pyrates, with three thouſand <hi>Greeks</hi> that
were in pay under the <hi>Perſians,</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſerving
to recruit the Forces of the <hi>Macedons;</hi> and the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
being put to death, the other Ships were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to their own Fleet.</p>
            <p>It chanced that <hi>Ariſtonicus,</hi> the Uſurper of <hi>Methy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
ignorant of any ſuch thing as chanced in the
fore-part of the night, came with certain Pyrates
Ships to enter into the Haven; of whom when the
Watch demanded what he was, he ſaid he was <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtonicus,</hi>
and came to the ſuccour of <hi>Pharnabaſus:</hi>
They anſwered, He was at reſt, and could not then
be ſpoken withal; but it ſhould be lawful for him,
being their Friend, to enter into the Haven for that

night, and ſpeak with him when it was day. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtonicus</hi>
was the firſt that entred, and the ten Pyrate
ſhips followed him: But whiles they anchored their
ſhips, the Watchmen drew the Chain again over
the Haven, and then called up ſuch as lay near a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them; whereupon none of them durſt reſiſt,
but were all taken priſoners, and delivered to <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiterus</hi>
and <hi>Egilocus.</hi> From thence the <hi>Macedons</hi>
paſſed to <hi>Mytelene,</hi> which was kept by <hi>Chares</hi> of
<hi>Athens,</hi> with a Garriſon of two thouſand <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
but when he was not able to endure the
Siege, he yeilded up the City, on compoſition to
have their lives ſaved, and to depart to <hi>Imbroſs.
Darius</hi> deſpairing of peace, which he thought to
have obtained by his Letters and Embaſſadours,
gave his minde to Muſter a new Army, and freſhly
to renew the War: Therefore he commanded the
Captains and Rulers of his men to have a Rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouze
at <hi>Babylon;</hi> and that <hi>Beſſus,</hi> Governour of the
<hi>Bactrians,</hi> ſhould come thither with all the power
he could make. The <hi>Bactrians</hi> are the moſt hardy
people among thoſe Nations, rough men, and much
abhorring the delicateneſs of the <hi>Perſians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> For by
reaſon that they border upon the <hi>Scythians,</hi> which
is a Warlike Nation, they are accuſtomed to live by
ſpoil, and are converſant continually in Arms:
But <hi>Beſſus,</hi> who was ſuſpected of Treaſon, affecting
the Kingdom, and who would not be content with
a ſecond place, put <hi>Darius</hi> in great jealouſies; who
having an inkling that he aſpired to be King, feared
his Treaſon; <hi>Beſſus</hi> having no other way, but by
that, to bring his purpoſe to paſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> wrought all the ways he could to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:46658:59"/>
knowledge where <hi>Darius</hi> was, and into what
Country he was gone; and yet could not get any
intelligence, by reaſon of a Cuſtom amongſt the
<hi>Perſians,</hi> who are accuſtomed, with a marvellous
fidelity, to keep cloſe their Princes ſecrets, in the
uttering whereof, neither fear of death, nor hope
of reward, can cauſe them to bring forth a word.
This was an Ancient Diſcipline which the Kings
there uſed among their Subjects, in puniſhing, with
loſs of life, the laviſhneſs of the tongue, which is
there more grievouſly chaſtiſed then any other crime:
Nor is there, in thoſe parts, any Vertue looked for
at any mans hands, who hath not the gift of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſie,
whereof Nature hath given a facility in
man. This was the cauſe that <hi>Alexander</hi> was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of all things that his Enemies did; and
therefore continued his Siege before <hi>Gaza. Betis</hi>
was Captain there, who was a man of notable Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
towards his Prince, and with a ſmall Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
defended the City that was of a large compaſs:
Wherefore <hi>Alexander</hi> perceiving the advantage of
the Scituation, cauſed many Mines to be made;
for the lightneſs of the ground covered the deſigne,
having neither Rocks nor Stones to give any impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment:
They began their Mines on that ſide
where they within could not behold them; and to
avoid the ſuſpition of any ſuch work in hand, he
cauſed an approach to be made to the Walls with
Towers that he had made of Timber; but the ground
would not ſerve for their carrying and removing,
by reaſon of the looſeneſs of the Sand whereinto
the Wheels ſunk, and was the cauſe that the Joynts
of the Towers brake aſunder. About the carriage
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:46658:60"/>
of them many were hurt, and much trouble they
had, both in withdrawing of them, and in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them forwards. When he perceived he could
not prevail by that means, he drew off his men
for that time: But the next day he environed the
City round about, to give an aſſault on every
part at once; and before he returned out of his
Camp, he made Sacrifice, after his Country man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
requiring the aid of the gods. It chanced, as
he was ſo doing, that a Raven flying by, let fall
a Clod (which ſhe carried in her Claws) upon
the Kings Head, where it brake in pieces, and the
Raven flew unto the next Tower, where her fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were ſo entangled with pitch, that ſhe could
not fly away, but was taken by the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>anders there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts.
This was thought a matter worthy on
which the Diviners ſhould conſult, for he himſelf
was not free from the Superſtition of ſuch things:
Therefore <hi>Ariſtander,</hi> to whom he gave moſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
did interpret the ſame to be a ſigne of the
deſtruction of that City; but yet there was ſome
peril (he ſaid) appearing towards the Kings per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
for which cauſe he perſwaded <hi>Alexander,</hi> that
he ſhould not go about any exerciſe that day.
Though it grieved him much, that one City
ſhould be a ſtay and impediment unto him for his
free paſſage into <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet he obeyed the Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticators,
and cauſed all his men, for that day,
to retire. The Enemies took courage at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
thinking fear to be the cauſe why they
came not forwards; and iſſuing out of the City,
they ſet upon the Rear: But they were more fierce
in the beginning of the skirmiſh, then conſtant in
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:46658:60"/>
the maintaining of it: for when they ſaw the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedons</hi>
rally themſelves, they ſtayed, and purſued
no further. <hi>Alexander</hi> hearing the Alarm, and
quite forgetting the peril that was prophecied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, at his Friends requeſt put on his Armour,
(which he was ſeldom accuſtomed to do) and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted
thither where the skirmiſh was moſt hot.
There he was known by a certain <hi>Arabian,</hi> that was
one of <hi>Darius</hi> Souldiers, who took upon him a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate
enterprize to kill <hi>Alexander;</hi> and therefore
making his pretence to be as a Fugitive from the
<hi>Perſians,</hi> kept his Sword ſecret underneath his
Target, and fell down on his knees before him;
who judging that he had fled to him for ſuccour,
commanded that he ſhould be received among his
own men: But the <hi>Arabian</hi> therewithal made a
violent thruſt at the King with his Sword; which
he ſtepping aſide a little, did avoid it from his
throat, and cut off the <hi>Arabians</hi> hand that miſſed
of the thruſt. <hi>Alexander</hi> then judged, that he had
clean eſcaped the peril that ſhould have chanced
to him that day: But (as I think) Deſtiny cannot
be avoided; for whiles he was eager in fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the foremoſt, he was ſhot with an Arrow,
which paſſed through his Corſlet, and did ſtick in
his ſhoulder. <hi>Philip,</hi> his Phyſitian, did pluck it out,
and great abundance of blood did follow, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
every man was afraid, for ſo much as they never
ſaw an Arrow paſs ſo far through any Armour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
But he never changed countenance, nor co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour;
but cauſing the blood to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>enched, and
his wound to be wrapped up, continued ſtill in
the skirmiſh amongſt the foremoſt, either ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:46658:61"/>
or diſſembling his pain. But when the blood
that was ſtayed for the time did break out again,
and the wound, which for the newneſs thereof
grieved him not much, began to ſwell and rankle,
as the blood waxed cold; then he began to faint
and fall down, and was taken up by ſuch as were
next unto him, and carried into his Tent. <hi>Betis</hi>
that perceived this, and ſuppoſing him to be ſlain,
retired unto the City with great joy and triumph.
But <hi>Alexanders</hi> wound being yet unhealed, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
a Mount to be caſt up as high as the top of the
Walls, and the Walls to be caſt down in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
by the Miners.</p>
            <p>They within made a Counter-work as high as the
old Wall, but it did not reach to the height of the
Towers made upon the Mount; ſo that the inner
parts of the City were ſubject to the ſhot of the
Enemy. But not long after, a Mine, the Wall by
it being overthrown, and a breach made, through
which the <hi>Macedons</hi> did enter, was the utter loſs of
the Town; where <hi>Alexander</hi> preſſing on amongſt
the foremoſt adventurouſly, had his leg hurt with
a ſtone: Notwithſtanding that, he mounted up
by the help of his Weapon (his former wound yet
uncloſed) and fought amongſt the foremoſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a great fury, that in the Siege of one City he
had received two wounds. <hi>Betis</hi> that had fought
notably, and received divers hurts, was forſaken
of his own men; and notwithſtanding which, he
maintained ſtill the fight, and all his Armour was
imbrued with his own blood, and his Enemies:
But when he was incloſed round, <hi>Alexander</hi> who
was wont to wonder at the Vertue of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:46658:61"/>
being puffed up with an inſolent joy, ſaid
unto him: Betis, <hi>thou ſhalt not die as thou wouldeſt
thy ſelf, but whatſoever torments may be invented,
believe that thou ſhalt ſuffer them.</hi> For all which
words, there appeared in <hi>Betis</hi> no token of fear;
but he beheld the King with an undaunted coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and would not anſwer him one word:
Whereupon <hi>Alexander</hi> ſaid; <hi>See you not how obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
he doth continue? He will neither kneel, nor ſo
much as ask mercy; but groans ſhall break his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
if nothing elſe can do it.</hi> Thus his Fortune
did alter his Nature, and turned his Wrath into
Fury: For he cauſing Cords to be put through <hi>Betis</hi>
feet, whileſt he was alive, did draw him about the
City with Horſes, glorying in that he did imitate
<hi>Achilles</hi> (of whom he was deſcended) in the like
affliction of his Enemy.</p>
            <p>There were ſlain of the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi>
ten thouſand, and the Victory was not unbloody
to the <hi>Macedons.</hi> This Siege was not ſo famous
through the Nobility of the City, as it was by the
double danger the King was in, who making haſte
to paſs into <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſent <hi>Amintas</hi> with ten Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys
into <hi>Macedon,</hi> to levy more Souldiers: For
though he were always a Conquerour, yet his men
were diminiſhed; and he truſted not ſo much to
the Souldiers of thoſe Countries he had ſubdued, as
he did to his own Nation. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> being a
people that always were offended with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of the good fortune of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who
in their Government over them uſed much pride
and covetouſneſs: And therefore ſeeking all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
to revolt, had received <hi>Amintas,</hi> who came
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:46658:62"/>
to them rather by way of treaty, then by force: and
now eſpecially at <hi>Alexanders</hi> coming, they plucked
up their ſpirits, and aſſembled a great number to
meet him at <hi>Peluſium,</hi> where they judged he would
enter.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh day, after he removed from <hi>Gaza,</hi>
he came to the place in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which now is called
<hi>Alexanders</hi> Camp; from whence he ſent his Army
unto <hi>Peluſium,</hi> by the Land-way, and he himſelf,
with a choice Band of men, was conveyed thither
upon the River of <hi>Nile.</hi> The <hi>Perſians</hi> durſt not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
his coming, being in doubt the <hi>Egyptians</hi>
would revolt: And therefore, when <hi>Alexander</hi>
drew near unto <hi>Memphis,</hi> where <hi>Aſtaces, Darius</hi>
Lieutenant, was with a power of men, he came
over the River to meet <hi>Alexander;</hi> and yeilding
himſelf, he delivered him eight hundred Talents,
with all the riches belonging to the King of <hi>Perſia.</hi>
From <hi>Memphis</hi> he paſſed upon the ſame River into
the inward parts of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and ſo ordered the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Country, that he changed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of their Laws and Cuſtoms: Which having
effected, he had a great deſire to worſhip the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
of <hi>Jupiter Hammon.</hi> But it was declared unto
him, that it was not poſſible for him to march with
any great number, the Country he had to travel
through being ſpread all over with barren ſands,
which being heated with the Sun, would burn
their feet in ſuch ſort, that it ſhould be intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for them to travel, not only with the heat and
want of water, but alſo with the rowling ſand,
which was ſo deep, and would ſo ſink under their
feet, that they ſhould not eaſily ſtir. All which
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:46658:62"/>
difficulties the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſet forth to be greater
then they were indeed. But <hi>Alexander,</hi> for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
deſire he had to exceed the condition of
man, was ſo fervently bent to viſit that famous
Oracle of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> whom either he believed, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
that others ſhould believe to be his Father, that
nothing could withhold him in performing of that
Enterprize: Therefore with ſuch as he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to accompany him in the journey, he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by water upon the <hi>Nile,</hi> until he came to the
Mariſh of <hi>Meotis.</hi> The Embaſſadours of the <hi>Cyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
came to him thither, and brought him Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents;
whom he gently entertained, aſſuring them
of his Friendſhip; which done, he went forward
in his Voyage. The firſt and ſecond days travel
ſeemed tolerable, not being yet come to the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
and deſolate Wilderneſs; and yet the ground
they paſſed on was but unfruitful and barren earth:
but when the Plains appeared that were covered
over with deep ſands, they then looked round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, and ſought for Land, as men be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
to do when they ſail on the Main Sea; for
they could not judge themſelves on Land, where
they neither ſaw Tree, nor any appearance of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,
or haunt of men: And there was no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be found in that dry and burning place;
and ſuch as they had brought with them in Bottles
upon Camels backs, was conſumed and ſpent: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
the Sun was ſo hot, that it dried and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up all things. When they were afflicted after
this manner, whether it were by the Will of God,
or by chance, the Clouds ſuddenly overwhelmed
the Sky, and ſo ſhadowed them, that it was a great
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:46658:63"/>
comfort unto ſuch as were wearied with heat,
though they wanted water to drink. But to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
their need, there fell by and by a great Shower,
which every man (for the great deſire he had to
drink) gaped to receive with open mouth.
When they had travelled four days in travelling
theſe wilde Deſarts, and were come near unto the
place of the Oracle, there appeared a great ſwarm
of Crows flying low before them; and when the
Army marched ſoftly, they ſate down upon the
ground, and ſometimes flew forwards, as though
they had been Guides to ſhew unto them the way.
At length they came unto the place conſecrate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Jupiter,</hi> where it was a wonder to ſee in the
midſt of ſo wilde a Deſart, a ground ſo environed
on all parts with high Trees, defending the heat of
the Sun, and ſuch a number of Springs running
every where, which cauſed the Woods always to
look green: The Air, all ſeaſons of the year there,
is like unto the Spring-time, wholeſome, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate.
This Country doth border on the <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops,</hi>
towards the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> and upon the <hi>Arabians,</hi>
whom they call <hi>Troglodites,</hi> upon the <hi>South;</hi> whoſe
Country ſtretched to the <hi>Red Sea:</hi> It confineth
on the <hi>Weſt</hi> with other <hi>Ethiops,</hi> which are called
<hi>Simnoes.</hi> Towards the <hi>North</hi> lieth a Nation, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Nalamons,</hi> who inhabiting upon a flat ſhore,
are accuſtomed to live upon the ſpoils of the Sea,
and lye always in wait, upon the Coaſt, to ſpoil ſuch
Ships as ſuffer wrack: The people which inhabit
about the Wood, be called <hi>Ammonians,</hi> and dwell
in Cottages ſcattered abroad: The midſt of their
Wood, cloſed about with a triple Wall, is unto
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:46658:63"/>
them a Caſtle: In the firſt Ward is the Palace of
their Ancient Kings; in the ſecond their Wives,
Children and Concubines were lodged; in which
place the Oracle of <hi>Jupiter</hi> is alſo; and the third is
a place for their Men of War. There is alſo another
Wood, having a Spring, called <hi>the Fountain of the
Sun;</hi> which in the morning is luke-warm, in the
midſt of the day cold, and in the evening warm
again: at mid-night it is ſcalding hot; and as it
draweth towards day, it diminiſheth his heat more
and more.</p>
            <p>The ſame Effigies that is worſhipped for <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
hath not the ſimilitude of other Images that

thereof, an Emerald ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

any anſwer is required, the Prieſts carry the ſame
in a Ship of Gold, that hath many Plates of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hanging on both ſides; the Matrons and the
Virgins follow after, ſinging a ſtrange Song, after
their Country manner; whereby they believe they
do oblige <hi>Jupiter</hi> to ſhew his Oracle manifeſt and
true. When <hi>Alexander</hi> was come unto the place,
the Eldeſt of the Prieſts, who came to meet him,
ſaluted him in the Name of <hi>Jupiters</hi> Son, for ſo
(he ſaid) his minde was that he ſhould be called:
Whereupon <hi>Alexander</hi> forgetting the ſtate of his
Mortality, ſaid, <hi>That he did both receive and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the Name.</hi> Then he demanded further,
<hi>If the Empire of the whole World were appointed
him by Deſtiny?</hi> There the Prophet, prepared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to Flattery, anſwered, <hi>That the whole World
ſhould come under his Obeyſance.</hi> After that, he
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:46658:64"/>
demanded, <hi>Whether all ſuch had ſuffered death that
had murthered his Father?</hi> The Prieſt anſwered.
<hi>That his Father could not be harmed by the Treaſon
of any man;</hi> but he ſaid, <hi>That all</hi> Philips <hi>Killers
were put to death:</hi> And one thing he added more,
<hi>That he ſhould be Invincible, till ſuch time as he
ſhould depart to the gods.</hi> Thereupon <hi>Alexander</hi>
made Sacrifice, and both offered unto the Idol,
and gave great gifts unto the Prieſts. He permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
alſo his Friends to ask Counſel of the Oracle
for ſuch things as they would demand: Yet they
enquired no further, but if it were <hi>Jupiters</hi> will
that they ſhould worſhip their King with Divine
Honours? To this it was anſwered, <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> if they
honoured their Victorious Prince as a god, it ſhould
be acceptable unto</hi> Jupiter. If he had with judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
weighed the Oracle, he might have well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the untruth that was therein: but whom
Fortune hath brought to believe in her, ſhe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
them, many times, more deſirous of glory,
then able to receive it. <hi>Alexander</hi> not only ſuffered,
but commanded himſelf to be called the Son of
<hi>Jupiter:</hi> and whileſt he went about to encreaſe the
Fame of his Acts, he did corrupt and deface them
with ſuch vanity: and the <hi>Macedons,</hi> accuſtomed to
be governed by Kings, but yet reſerving a greater
ſhadow of Liberty then other Nations, did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
him more obſtinately in affecting of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
then was either expedient for him or
them. But theſe things ſhall be declared in time
convenient: I will proceed to declare the reſt of
his Acts.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> was returned from <hi>Hammon,</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:46658:64"/>
and come to the Mariſh of <hi>Meotis,</hi> ſcituate near
unto the Iſle of <hi>Pharos,</hi> he viewed the nature of the
place, and was at the firſt determined to build a
City within the Iſland: But afterwards, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Iſle not to be large enough, he choſe out
the ground where <hi>Alexandria</hi> now ſtandeth (call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the name of the Builder) containing all that
ground between the <hi>Mear</hi> and the Sea; the walls
whereof were in compaſs eighty furlongs. When
he had taken order for the building of this City,
leaving ſuch behinde him as he had appointed for
the performance thereof, he departed unto <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phis.</hi>
He had a deſire (not unreaſonable, if it had
been in time convenient) to have ſeen both the
inward parts of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and alſo of <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> and
the affection he had to view Antiquities, and the
famous places of <hi>Mamnon</hi> and <hi>Tyton,</hi> had near
drawn him beyond the bounds of the Sun. But
the Wars he had in hand being of much more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
then any ſuch idle Peregrination, gave
him no time to fulfil his fantaſie; therefore he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<hi>Aeſtilus</hi> a <hi>Rhodian,</hi> and <hi>Peuceſtes</hi> a <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
to the Government of <hi>Egypt,</hi> aſſigning them
four thouſand Souldiers for defence of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
and gave <hi>Polymen</hi> thirty Galleys to keep the
Mouth of <hi>Nile.</hi> He made <hi>Apollonius</hi> Ruler of that
part of <hi>Africa</hi> which joyneth unto <hi>Egypt;</hi> and <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi>
Receiver of the Tributes in both Countries.
This new City was ſoon repleniſhed with a great
multitude; for Commandment was given to all
Countries thereabouts, to ſend Inhabitants unto
<hi>Alexandria.</hi> It is ſaid, that when the King, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Macedons</hi> Cuſtom, uſed the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:46658:65"/>
of ſteeping Barley at the raiſing of the Walls,
the Birds came and fed thereupon; which being
taken by many for an unlucky Token, it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
by their Diviners, <hi>That there ſhould be
great reſort of ſtrangers to that City, and that it
ſhould give nouriſhment to many Lands.</hi> As the
King went down the River of <hi>Nile, Hector,</hi> the Son
of <hi>Parmenio,</hi> deſirous to follow him, was drowned;
for the Veſſel that carried him ſunk, being crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with over-many men: He ſtrived long with the
Stream, but his garments gave impediment to his
ſwimming, ſo that his breath was near gone before
he could recover the ſhore, where for want of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
he died; whoſe unfortunate chance <hi>Alexander</hi>
took grievouſly, as one that did bear him ſpecial
favour; and therefore cauſed his body to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
buried.</p>
            <p>The death of <hi>Andromachus,</hi> Lieutenant of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
whom the <hi>Samaritans</hi> had burned alive, was
the increaſe of <hi>Alexanders</hi> ſorrow, for the revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whereof he made all the haſte he could; and
at his coming into <hi>Samaria,</hi> had the Authors of
the act delivered into his hands, whom he put to
death, and then placed <hi>Memnon</hi> in <hi>Andromachus</hi>
Room. He delivered into the <hi>Methinians</hi> hands,
<hi>Ariſtonicus</hi> and <hi>Crijolaus,</hi> who uſurped over them,
whom they after many grievous torments did hang
over their walls: That done, he gave Audience to
the Embaſſadours of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> the <hi>Rhodians,</hi>
and the <hi>Scots.</hi> The <hi>Athenians</hi> did gratifie unto
him his Victory; and required, that ſuch <hi>Greeks</hi> as
were taken priſoners might be reſtored to liberty:
The <hi>Rhodians,</hi> and the <hi>Scots,</hi> complained of their
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:46658:65"/>
Garriſons: He granted to them all their requeſts,
and reſtored to the <hi>Mytelens</hi> all their Pledges, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
their Territory and Dominion, in reſpect of
the fidelity they ſhewed unto him, and gave them
ſecurity for the money they had imployed in the
Wars. He gave honour alſo, according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervings,
unto the Kings of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> who revolted
from <hi>Darius</hi> unto him, and had aided him with
Ships at the Siege of <hi>Tyre: Amphoterus,</hi> his Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
had Commiſſion to drive the <hi>Perſians</hi> out of
the Iſle of <hi>Creet;</hi> but eſpecially, that he ſhould rid
the Seas of Pyrates, who troubled and ſpoiled all
the Iſlands, whileſt theſe two Princes, <hi>Alexander</hi>
and <hi>Darius,</hi> converted their Powers the one againſt
the other.</p>
            <p>Having ordered theſe things, he did dedicate
to <hi>Hercules,</hi> at <hi>Tyre,</hi> a great ſtanding Goblet, and
thirty Bowls of Gold: That done, he ſet his whole
minde and care upon <hi>Darius,</hi> cauſing it to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed,
that every man ſhould ſet forwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Euphrates.</hi> But <hi>Darius</hi> underſtanding that
his Enemy was gone through <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Africa,</hi>
ſtood in doubt whether he ſhould ſtay about <hi>Meſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia,</hi>
or withdraw into the inner parts of his
Kingdom; judging, that he in perſon ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with thoſe remote Nations, in bringing of them
forwards to the War, which his Lieutenants ſhould
not be ſo well able to effect: Yet when Fame had
publiſhed, and he underſtood by aſſured advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that <hi>Alexander</hi> was returned out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
and fully reſolved to follow him with all his power
into what Country ſoever he ſhould go; he then
gave order, that the force of all the furtheſt Nations
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:46658:66"/>
ſhould draw towards <hi>Babylon,</hi> knowing the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Enemy he had to match withal. Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reſorted both <hi>Bactrians, Scythians,</hi> and <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
(for the power of other Countries were come
thither before) and having the double number of
men that he had before in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> he prepared Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
for them with diligence, of which many of
them wanted: both Horſemen and Horſes were
armed with plates of Steel; ſuch as before had no
Weapons but Darts, had Swords and Bucklers gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
unto them; and to increaſe the power of his
Horſemen, he delivered many Horſes to be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and broken by the Footmen. He had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
alſo two hundred Waggons ſet with Hooks,
which in thoſe Countries were eſteemed things
of great force, and judged to be of a wonderful
terrour to the Enemy: they were made with great
long Spikes ſticking out before, and with Swords
ſet overthwart on both ſides: The Wheels were
alſo full of Iron Pikes right forth, and of great
Hooks both upward and downward, wherewith
all things were cut in ſunder that came in their
way. When his people were thus furniſhed with
Armour, and provided ſufficiently for the Wars,
he removed from <hi>Babylon,</hi> keeping the River of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris</hi>
on his right hand, and <hi>Euphrates</hi> on his left
hand: He overſpread, with his Army, all the Plains
of <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> after that he had paſſed the River
of <hi>Tygris;</hi> and underſtanding that his Enemy was
approaching, he ſent <hi>Satropaces</hi> before with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
choſen Horſemen, and afterwards appointed
ſix thouſand to <hi>Mazeus,</hi> to ſtop <hi>Alexander</hi> in the
paſſage over the River; who had alſo Commiſſion
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:46658:66"/>
to waſte and burn all the Country where he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his enemies ſhould come, thinking to famiſh
them for want of victuals, conſidering that they
had no other proviſions but what they got by plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
and by ſtealth; they themſelves having
plenty brought of all things, both by Land and the
River <hi>Tygris.</hi> At length he came to a village cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Arbella,</hi> which afterwards was famous by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his overthrow. There he left the greateſt
part of his Victuals and Carriage, and made a
Bridge over the River of <hi>Licus,</hi> and in five days
conveyed over his Army, as he had done before
over <hi>Euphrates:</hi> paſſing forwards from thence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
fourſcore furlongs, he came to another City
called <hi>Boumello,</hi> and there encamped. This Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
ſerved wonderful well for aranging of his Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels
in the large Plains, paſſable for Horſes every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
and without ſhrubs, or ſhort bruſh to cover
the ground withal, having ſo free a proſpect, that
the eye might diſcern things a great way off. And
if there appeared any Hills within the Plain, <hi>Darius</hi>
cauſed the ſame to be caſt down, and to be made le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
to the ground. Such as by conjecture made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
to <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Darius</hi> power, could not be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited;
for he could not think after ſo many ſlain,
there could be a greater power gathered together
then he had before.</p>
            <p>But he that doubted not any peril, much leſs the
multitude of them, after the eleventh encamping
came to the River of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> over the which he
made Bridges, paſſing over his horſemen, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
his footmen. For <hi>Mazeus</hi> that was ſent
againſt him with ſix thouſand horſemen to hinder
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:46658:67"/>
his paſſage, durſt not encounter him. When he had
continued there a few days, not only to reſt his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
but alſo to confirm their mindes, and to
encourage them, he ſet forwards reſolutely againſt
his enemies, fearing that they would have retired
back into the inward parts of <hi>Perſia,</hi> where he
ſhould have been inforced to follow them by waſte
places and deſarts. Therefore the fourth day he
paſſed by <hi>Arbella,</hi> and came to the River of <hi>Tygris.</hi>
All the Country beyond the River was on a ſmoak,
newly ſet on fire by <hi>Mazeus,</hi> who burned all things
where he came, even as he had been an enemy. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
at the firſt, by reaſon of the darkneſs of the
ſmoak, ſtayed for fear of Ambuſhments. But when they
which were ſent to ſcour the Country, reported that
all things were clear, he appointed a few horſemen
to prove the paſſage of the River, who found the
deepneſs at the firſt entry to come to the horſe
breaſt, and in the midſt of the ſtream to the horſe
neck. There is no River in all the Eaſt-part of the
world that runneth ſo violently, which beſides that
the waters of other Rivers do run into it, driveth
down ſtones with the ſtream; ſo that of its ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
it is called <hi>Tygris,</hi> which in the <hi>Perſian</hi> tongue
is to ſay an Arrow. The footmen thereof divided
into two Bands, and holding their Armour over
their heads, were incloſed on both ſides with the
horſemen, and ſo paſſed, till they came to the deep
of the channel, without any great difficulty. The
King was the firſt amongſt the footmen that paſſed
over to the further ſide, who (with his hand, ſeeing
his voice could not be heard) ſhewed the ſhallow
places unto the Souldiers. But they had much to do
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:46658:67"/>
to keep their footing, by reaſon of the ſtones where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they ſtumbled, and of the violence of the
water that took their feet away. Such as carried
burthens on their backs had the greateſt travel, not
being able to ſtay themſelves by reaſon of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of their carriage, were born down by violence
of the ſtream. And whileſt every man went about
to recover again his own, there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell greater ſtrife
amongſt themſelves, then they had with the ſtream;
and the heaps of fardels that every where flowed
upon the water, bare down many of them. The
King cryed to them, that it was ſufficient to keep
their arms, and let the reſt go, promiſing to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
every man: but they neither followed his
counſel, nor did as he commanded them; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the noiſe that was amongſt them, Fear filled
their ears as they were ſwimming and wading
through the water. At length where the ſtream was
moſt ſhallow they came forth, there being nothing
miſcarried or wanting amongſt them all, ſaving a
few fardles. If their enemies had made but a prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
againſt them, they might eaſily have been put to
diſtreſs. But <hi>Alexander</hi>'s good fortune turned his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
away from him, with which ſucceſs he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the River of <hi>Granike,</hi> when ſo many thouſands
of horſemen and footmen kept the paſſage againſt
him. After that manner he overcame the multitude
of his enemies in the Streights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>Cilicia.</hi> Though
his hardineſs were ſuch, that it ſometimes wanted
praiſe, yet his felicity ever delivered him out of all
extremity of peril.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Mazeus</hi> had done his part, and ſet upon
them as they were paſſing the River, he might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:46658:68"/>
have put them to diſtreſs, being unarmed and
out of order; but after the <hi>Macedons</hi> had armed
themſelves (being then too late) he began to ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

himſelf with a thouſand Horſemen. When <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
perceived the ſmall number that came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, he cauſed <hi>Ariſton</hi> Captain of the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
to give a full charge upon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n. The Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that day notably behaved themſelves, but
eſpecially <hi>Ariſton,</hi> who with his Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the chief Captain through the throat, and

               </gap>w

               </gap>ried there
two days, and on the morning cauſed warning to
be given by Proclamation for his ſetting forwards.
But in the firſt watch of the night the Moon ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an Eclipſe; and loſing her brightneſs, became
afterwards red as blood, and then waxed dim and
dark: The ſtrangeneſs of this ſight did ſtrike a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
fear amongſt the <hi>Macedons,</hi> whereof pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
ſuch a doubt and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ad, that they fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a murmuring, why they ſhould be brought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in ſuch a manner againſt the will of the gods
into the uttermoſt bounds of the Earth, where
they could neither paſs the Rivers, nor enjoy the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
uſe of the Elements, finding nothing but
waſte grounds and wilde deſarts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all which was
endured (they ſaid) for the ambition of one man;
for whoſe vain-glory the blood of ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
ſhould be ſhed. He deſpiſeth (ſaith they) his

and hath affected Heaven in his fooliſh ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:46658:68"/>
And now it was come near unto ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when <hi>Alexander,</hi> that in all things was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fear, commanded the chief Rulers and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of his man of War to aſſemble at his Pavilion,
and there commanded the Aſtronom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Planets) to declare their opinions.
They underſtanding very well the revolutions of
the time, and their appointed courſes, kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w that
the Moon was ever eclipſed, when that either ſhe
was underneath the earth, or elſe when her light was
bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>miſhed by oppoſition of the Sun; which reaſon
reſerved amongſt themſelves, they accuſtome not
to acquaint the people with it. But affirm that
the <hi>Greeks</hi> were under the Aſpect of the Sun, and
the <hi>Perſians</hi> under the Moon: and therefore ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as the Moon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>d
great deſtruction unto the Nations under that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation.
And to confirm that opinion of theirs,
they brought in old Preſidents of the Kings of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi>
to whom the eclipſe of the Moon had ſignified
that the gods were againſt them in ſighting of
their Battel. There is nothing more effectual
then ſuperſtition to govern a multitude, which
otherwiſe is without rule, tumultuous, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table:
but when they have once conceived a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
though it be but vain, they are more obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to their Diviners, then to their Captains;
which thing might be well perceived, when the
anſwers of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were divulged amongſt
the people. For they ſtreightways were removed
from their dulneſs and deſpair, and ſtirred up to
hope and confidence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:46658:69"/>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> therefore that could uſe the time, and
imploy his Souldiers in their good mood, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
watch removed their camp, keeping <hi>Tygris</hi> on
his right hand, and the Mountains which they call
<hi>Gordian</hi> on his left: By break of day the Scouts
that he ſent before to diſcover the enemy, returned
to him with report of <hi>Darius</hi> his coming: then the
Souldiers prepared themſelves to fight, and marched
forwards in order of battel. But thoſe who were
diſcoverers for the <hi>Perſians</hi> were a thouſand horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who ſeemed to the <hi>Macedons</hi> to be a great
Army. The Scouts commonly have that property,
that when they cannot finde out the truth, they i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
through fear things that be falſe. When
<hi>Alexander</hi> underſtood the certainty, he ſent towards
them a ſmall number of his own horſemen, at
whoſe coming they fled, and were partly ſlain, and
part of them taken priſoners. That done, he ſent
forth another party, as well to diſcover further, as alſo
to quench the fire which the <hi>Perſians</hi> had made
through all the Country; for as they fled away
they put fire into the roofs of their houſes, and the
ſtacks of Corn, which ſoon took hold above, and
conſumed all, till it came to the ground. By the
extinguiſhing of thoſe fires, great plenty of Corn was
preſerved, and abundance of all other things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
amongſt the <hi>Macedons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> this was a motive
which incouraged the Souldiers greatly to purſue
their enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they doubting that they might
burn and conſume all ſuch things as might ſerve to
their uſe, purſued them with all the ſpeed they could
make providence growing from neceſſity. For <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeus,</hi>
who before did burn the Country at leiſure,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:46658:69"/>
when he ſaw himſelf purſued, fled away, and left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Macedons</hi> the greater part untouched.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> underſtanding that <hi>Darius</hi> drew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, and was come within an hundred and
fifty furlongs, made proviſion of Victuals, and
remained four days in the ſame place. <hi>Darius</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were there intercepted, which he had written
to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> in perſwaſion either to kill or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
<hi>Alexander.</hi> He doubted whether he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
the ſame Letters openly, or no, having no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt
of their fidelity and affection towards him.
But <hi>Parmenio</hi> diſſwaded him from acquainting the
Souldiers with any ſuch promiſes of <hi>Darius,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that the committing of ſuch an act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
in one mans hands, and that covetouſneſs
never judged any thing unlawful. He followed
<hi>Parmenio</hi>'s counſel, and ſo removed his Camp. As
they were marching, one of the Eunuches that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
upon <hi>Darius</hi> wife, brought word how ſhe
fainted, and was in great peril of death; for ſhe
in very deed was ſo wearied with continual tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
and affection of minde, that ſhe fell down in a
ſwound betwixt her mother-in-law and her young
daughter, and ſo died. He had no ſooner reported
it, but another came with tydings that ſhe was
dead indeed: whereat <hi>Alexander</hi> was no leſs ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful
than if his own mother had been in the ſame
condition; and weeping no leſs then <hi>Darius</hi> ſhould
have done, he repaired into the Tent where <hi>Darius</hi>
mother was ſitting by the dead body: his ſorrow
there renewed, when he ſaw her lie proſtrate upon
the ground, that preſent misfortune calling to
minde her paſſed calamities: ſhe took in her arms
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:46658:70"/>
               <hi>Darius</hi> two Daughters, a comfort to her in their
mutual dolour, but that ſhe was enforced to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
them. Her young Grand-child ſtood in her
preſence, the more to be pitied, becauſe that for
his youth he yet underſtood not the calamity that
was growing on him. A man would have thought,
that <hi>Alexander</hi> had wept for his own cauſe; he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
and would receive no comfort, but abſtained
from meat, and commanded all honour to be done
to the dead corps after the Country-cuſtome of the
<hi>Perſians.</hi> Worthy he was thereby to receive the
due reward of his meekneſs and continency. He
had only ſeen her once before, which was on the
day ſhe was taken, and then came not to viſit her,
but <hi>Darius</hi> mother; the excellency of her beauty
was no provokement to him of luſt, but of glory.
Of thoſe Eunuches that were about the Queen,
there was one <hi>Tyriotes,</hi> who during this lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
eſcaped by a Gate that was unwarded, and fled
unto the <hi>Perſians</hi> Camp, where he was by the
Watchmen brought to <hi>Darius</hi> preſence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
ſaw him lamenting and tearing his cloaths, he
was in a labouring expectation what his ſorrow
ſhould be, doubting what thing he might fear moſt.
<hi>Thy countenance</hi> (quoth he) <hi>declareth that ſome great
miſchief is happened: Take he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d thou conceal nothing
from my miſerable ears: I have learn'd to be unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
and it's often-times a comfort to a man in his
calamity to know his miſhap. Is it not the miſuſing of
my wife and children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that thou wouldeſt inform me
with? Which is the thing that I ſuſpect moſt, and fear
to utter; and which (as I believe) is alſo moſt grievous
unto them.</hi> Nothing leſs (quoth <hi>Tyri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tes</hi>) the ſame
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:46658:70"/>
honour that was given unto them by your Subjects,
the like is uſed by him that is the Conquerour: But
your wife is the cauſe of my amazement, who is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
now dead.</p>
            <p>When that word was once ſpoken, there was
nothing but lamentation and mourning throughout
the Camp; and <hi>Darius</hi> could not be otherwiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
but that ſhe was ſlain, becauſe ſhe would not
conſent to her miſuſement; and in the vehemency
of his ſorrow, cried out:</p>
            <p>O <hi>Alexander,</hi> what ſo great an offence have I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
againſt thee? Whom of thy kindred have I
ſlain, that thou ſhouldeſt requite me with this cruelty?
Thou haſt done it without any provokement of my part.
But be it ſo that thou doſt move a juſt war againſt me, is
it thy part therefore to make war with women?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tyriotes</hi> thereupon did ſwear by the immortal
gods, that there was no kinde of villany done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her, but that <hi>Alexander</hi> lamented her death, and
wept no leſs then he himſelf would have done.
Thoſe words did drive him into a further ſuſpicion
and jealouſie, conjecturing that <hi>Alexander</hi>'s beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
had proceeded from the familiar converſation
had betwixt them. Therefore he commanding all
perſons from him ſaving only <hi>Tyriotes,</hi> that lyes
can take no place, Torments ſtreightways ſhall
be brought before thee: I require thee therefore,
if any reverence of thy Prince remain within thy
heart, tell me without compulſion the thing that
I deſire to know, and am aſhamed to enquire. Is
it poſſible, being of the age that he is, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her in his hands, that he ſhould not attempt
her? <hi>Tyriotes</hi> offered himſelf to be racked in tryal
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:46658:71"/>
of the cauſe, and called the gods to witneſs, that
ſhe was never uſed but chaſtly and reverently. At
length, when he was throughly perſwaded that his
words were true; he covered his face, weeping a
long ſpace, and afterwards the tears yet diſtilling
down his cheeks, uncovered it, and holding up his
hands to Heaven, ſaid:</p>
            <p>O you gods whom I worſhip, I require you chiefly
to eſtabliſh this Kingdom unto my ſelf: but if you have
determined my ruine and decay, then my requeſt is,
that none may reign as King in my Dominion, but even
he that is ſo juſt an Enemy, and ſo merciful a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
            <p>And therefore, though he had twice before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
peace at <hi>Alexander</hi>'s hands, and prevailed
not, but had converted all his minde towards the
Wars; yet he was then ſo overcome with the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
of his enemy, that he ſent twelve of the
chiefeſt of his blood as Ambaſſadours to treat with
him upon conditions of peace: <hi>Alexander</hi> calling a
Councel, gave them audience, to whom the eldeſt
ſpake in this manner:</p>
            <p>That <hi>Darius</hi> hath now the third time demanded
peace of you, no power hath compelled him, but your
juſtice and continency hath invited him unto it. He
cannot perceive that either his Mother, his Wife, or
Children were priſoners, ſaving for the want of their
company. You take care of their chaſtities which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
alive, like a Father; You give to them the honour
appertaining to them, and ſuffer them to continue in
their former eſtate. I ſee that ſadneſs in your counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
which I ſaw in <hi>Darius</hi> when I parted from him,
and yet he doth mourn for his Wife, and you for your
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:46658:71"/>
Enemie: and if the care of her burial had not been,
you had now ſtood in Battel in readineſs to fight againſt
him. Is it any marvel therefore if he require peace of
ſuch a man, that is ſo friendly diſpoſed towards him?
What ſhall they need to contend with arms, between
whom there remaineth no hatred? In his former Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
he offered that the River of <hi>Alys,</hi> which boundeth
upon <hi>Lydia,</hi> ſhould be the Confines of your Empire:
but now he proffereth you in Dower with his Daughter to
be delivered out of hand all thoſe Countries that lie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Helleſpont</hi> and <hi>Euphrates.</hi> For the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of which his Promiſe, and for the obſerving of
Peace, <hi>Occhus</hi> his Son now in your poſſeſſion ſhall be
the pledge for his part. His requeſt is, to have his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and his two Daughters reſtored unto him, for
which you ſhall receive thirty thouſand Talents. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
I knew the moderation that is in you, I would not
be ſo bold to ſay that this is a time when you ought not
only to grant peace, but alſo to ſeek for it your ſelf:
Look back and behold what a great thing you leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
you, and foreſee how much it is that you covet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you. An Empire over great is dangerous, and it is
hard to hold that which you are not able to receive. Do
you not ſee, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe Ships which be of exceeding
greatneſs, cannot well be governed? Judge that to
be the cauſe that <hi>Darius</hi> loſt ſo much, becauſe that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
is the occaſion of much leſs: It is more eaſie to
get many things, then to keep a few. How much more
eaſily do our Hands catch, then hold faſt? The very
Death of <hi>Darius</hi> wiſe now doth ſhew, that you have
not ſo great occaſion to ſhew mercy as you had before.</p>
            <p>The Embaſſadours did withdraw into another
place, and he debated in Councel his opinion. It
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:46658:72"/>
was long before any durſt utter what they thought,
becauſe they were uncertain how the King was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined:
at length <hi>Parmenio</hi> ſpake, and ſaid:</p>
            <p>My opinion was ever, that the priſoners taken
at <hi>Damaſcus</hi> ſhould have been delivered to ſuch as
would redeem them, whereby a great ſum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
might have been made of them, who now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in captivity, trouble the hands of many
a man of ſervice. And now I think moſt neceſſary
of all, that you exchange for thirty Talents of
Gold, this old Woman, and the two young Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zels,
which be but impediments and diſturbance
to your marches. Here is a rich Realm to be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by Treaty, without any hazard of Battel. For
there was never any before you (<hi>quoth he</hi>) that
was Lord of all the Countries in length and bredth
lying between <hi>Iſter</hi> and <hi>Euphrates. He willed him
therefore rather to have reſpect towards</hi> Macedonia,
<hi>then to look forward towards</hi> Bactria <hi>and the</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe words liked not the King; and therefore
ſo ſoon as</hi> Parmenio <hi>had made an end of his Speech,
he made this anſwer:</hi> And if I were <hi>Parmenio,</hi> I
would rather deſire Money, then Glory. But now
ſeeing I am <hi>Alexander,</hi> I am not in any doubt of
poverty, and have in conſideration, that I am a King,
and no Merchant: I have nothing whereof I will
make Sale, I will much leſs ſell my Fortune. If
I were in minde to deliver the Priſoners, it were much
better to give them freely, then to ranſome them for
money.</p>
            <p>Hereupon he called the Embaſſadours, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
them in this ſort:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:46658:72"/>
Shew you to <hi>Darius,</hi> that giving of thanks is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
to an enemy, and let him not think that I have had
any reſpect to his friendſhip in thoſe things that I have
done of mine own clemency and liberality. Nor let
him impute the ſame in any wiſe towards himſelf, but
to the inclination of mine own nature; and that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
not againſt mens calamities, but againſt the force
of mine Enemies. I uſe not to make war with women
and priſoners; for he muſt be armed to whom I ſhall
owe my hatred. And though it were ſo indeed, that
he meant good faith in his peace asking, yet peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
I would take advice before I would conſent. But
ſeeing that at one time he hath provoked my Souldiers to
betray me, and at other times ſtirred up my friends with
money to deſtroy me, I muſt purſue him to the uttermoſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
not as a righteous enemy, but as one that worketh his
ends by treaſon. If I ſhould accept the condition of peace
that you do bring, I ſhould acknowledge him to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour.
His liberality doth give me all that is behinde
the River of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> not conſidering in what place
I ſpeak now unto you. Have you forgotten that I am
paſſed the River of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and incamped beyond
the bounds ye pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffer me in Dowry? Drive me from
hence, that I may know the ſame to be yours, wherewith
you would infeoff me. He proffereth me his Daughter
with no greater liberality then he would do to one of his
Servants. Doth he think to do me a pleaſure in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
me to be his Son-in-law before <hi>Mazeus?</hi> Go and
ſhew this to your King, that both what he hath loſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
what he hath yet in poſſeſſion, ſhall be unto me the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of the War, which ſhall determine the bounds
of both our Empires, and by the fortune of the battel
which we ſhall fight to morrow, appoint to each of us
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:46658:73"/>
our limits. Let him know, that I came not into <hi>Aſia</hi> to
receive, but to give. If he would have been content to
have been the ſecond perſon, and not coveted to be equal
with me, I would peradventure have granted his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.
But as two Suns cannot ſhine on the Earth at
once, ſo likewiſe two ſuch great Kingdoms cannot be at
one time, without the ſubverſion of the world. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let him either this day yield himſelf, or elſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
againſt the morrows fight; nor let him perſwade
himſelf to have any other fortune then what he hath
proved already.</p>
            <p>The Embaſſadours replied: That ſeeing he was
reſolved to proceed with War, he did Royally that
he was plain unto them, and did not feed them
with hope of peace. Their requeſt was therefore
that they might be diſpatched to their Prince, to
warn him to prepare himſelf likewiſe. When
they returned, there was no way but to prepare for
the fight. Wherefore <hi>Darius</hi> ſent for <hi>Mazeus</hi> with
three thouſand horſemen to keep the paſſages by
which the <hi>Macedons</hi> ſhould paſs. When <hi>Alexander</hi>
had performed the Funerals of <hi>Darius</hi> wife, leaving
a ſmall guard behinde, with all ſuch as were unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
for the fight, he ſet forward towards his
Enemies. His footmen were divided into two Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,
empaled with horſemen on both ſides, and
his carriages were placed in the midſt. He ſent
<hi>Medinas</hi> with horſemen upon the ſpurs to diſcover
where <hi>Darius</hi> was; but he not daring to adventure
far, becauſe <hi>Mazeus</hi> was there ſtrongly quartered,
returned back and reported, that there was nothing
to be heard but the noyſe of men and the neighing
of horſes. <hi>Mazeus</hi> alſo (the Scouts of <hi>Alexander</hi>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:46658:73"/>
being diſcovered) gave intelligence to <hi>Darius</hi> of
the approach of the enemy: <hi>Darius,</hi> who deſired
to try the event of the Battel in the open Plains,
commanded his Souldiers to be armed, and put his
Army in array of Battel. Two thouſand of the
<hi>Bactrian</hi> and the <hi>Dahan</hi> horſe, and four thouſand
of the <hi>Arachoſians</hi> and <hi>Suſians</hi> did make the left
Wing: Theſe were followed by a hundred hooked
Chariots. Next unto them was <hi>Beſſus</hi> with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<hi>Bactrian</hi> horſe, and two thouſand of the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſagetae</hi>
did back him on his rear. To theſe the foot
of many Nations, not mixed, but in diſtinct Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
did joyn their formidable power: after them
<hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> and <hi>Oriobates,</hi> with the <hi>Mardians</hi> and
<hi>Sogdians,</hi> did bring up the Army of the <hi>Perſians.</hi>
This part of <hi>Darius</hi> Army was commanded in chief
by <hi>Orſines,</hi> deſcended from ſeven <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings, and
deriving alſo his Original from the noble King <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi>
There were other Nations that followed theſe,
but hardly known to their own Neighbours. After
whom, <hi>Cradates</hi> having fifty hooked Chariots, placed
a Band of <hi>Caſpian</hi> horſemen before them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
them were the <hi>Indians</hi> and the other inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters
of the red Sea, rather names of men then good
aſſiſtance. This ſquare was alſo empaled with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fifty Chariots, unto the which the mercenary
Souldiers were joyned: after them followed the men
of <hi>Armenia</hi> the leſs, then the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and next
the <hi>Bellicans,</hi> with ſuch as inhabit the <hi>Coſſean</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
The <hi>Gortuans</hi> came next, who ſometime fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the <hi>Medians</hi> out of <hi>Euboia;</hi> but at thoſe days
degenerated from their Country-cuſtoms. The <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ygi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Cathonians</hi> and <hi>Parthians</hi> did cloſe the rear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:46658:74"/>
In the Battel on the right hand were the people
of the greater <hi>Armenia,</hi> the <hi>Caduſians, Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docians</hi>
and <hi>Medians,</hi> who had fifty hooked Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots:
the ſum of his whole Army was forty five
thouſand horſemen, and two hundred thouſand
footmen. When they were placed in order of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
they marched forward ten furlongs, and then
were commanded to make a halt. Whileſt the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi>
after that manner tarried for their Enemies,
there fell a ſudden fear amongſt the <hi>Macedons,</hi>
whereof there appeared no cauſe; and yet every
man was amazed, and a ſecret dread entred into
their hearts. The lightning that fell out of the
air, it being in the Summer-ſeaſon, ſeemed like fire,
and the flames ſuddenly appearing were thought
to come from <hi>Darius</hi> Camp. If <hi>Mazeus,</hi> who was
ſent out to obſerve their coming, had ſet upon
them while they were in this fear, he might have
performed ſome notable act. But he was ſlow in
the enterprize, and remained upon the top of an
Hill, contented that he was not aſſailed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> perceiving the terrour that invaded
his Souldiers, made a ſigne for them to ſlay, and
gave order that they ſhould unarm themſelves, and
refreſh their bodies; giving them to underſtand,
that there was not any cauſe why they ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
ſo vain a fear, ſeeing their Enemies were
yet a good diſtance from them. At length, when
he perceived they had recovered their ſpirits, he
exhorted them to receive courage, and put on their
armour; but yet he thought nothing more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
then to fortifie his Camp in the ſame place.
The next day <hi>Mazeus,</hi> who had planted himſelf on
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:46658:74"/>
a high Hill, from whence he might behold his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
Camp, either for fear, or elſe becauſe his
Commiſſion was but only to diſcover the motion
of his Enemies, returned again unto <hi>Darius.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his departure, the <hi>Macedons</hi> immediately poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
themſelves of the Hill which he had forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
the ſame being of more ſtrength then the
Plain where they remained before, from whence
they might behold their Enemies Camp. And
though the Miſt which the moiſt Hills did caſt forth,
took not away clearly the uſe of their proſpect,
yet it hindred them to diſcern the diviſion of their
Enemies Battels, and their order: their multitude
overſpread the fields; and the noiſe of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
did fill their ears, though they were far off.
Then <hi>Alexander</hi> begun to revolve in his minde,
and to debate with himſelf one while <hi>Parmenio</hi>'s
Opinion, and another time his own; for he was
come ſo far forth, that he could not retire, except
he were Victorious, without the great deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Army. The multitude of his Enemies
moved him much, in reſpect of his ſmall numbers:
Yet on the other part, remembred what great Acts
he had done with them, and how many Nations
he had vanquiſhed: So that his hope ſurmounting
his fear, he thought it of all moſt dangerous to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Battel any longer, leſt deſperation ſhould
grow amongſt his men; and therefore diſſembling
the matter, he cauſed the Mercenary Horſemen,
and the <hi>Peons,</hi> to paſs on before, and divided his
<hi>Phalanx</hi> (as it hath been ſaid) into two Battels,
and impaled the ſame with Horſemen on both
ſides. By that time the Miſt vaniſhed, and it wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:46658:75"/>
clear, the order of his Enemies manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>red.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Macedons</hi> then, whether it were of courage,
or for that they were impatient to tarry any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
made ſuch a ſhout as men of War uſe when
they joyn in Battel: The like was alſo made by the
<hi>Perſians.</hi> Then the Woods and Valleys rebounded
with the terrible ſound: The <hi>Macedons</hi> could not
abſtain any longer, but would have gone forwards
towards their Enemies: But <hi>Alexander</hi> thought it
better to fortifie his Camp upon that Hill; and ſo
commanded it to be intrenched about: Which
work being ſpeedily performed, he entred into
his Tent, from whence he might behold the Field
Marſhalled, and the whole Army of his Enemies
embattelled; then the faſhion and form of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
that was at hand, was preſented before his
eyes; both Horſemen and Footmen gliſtered in their
bright Armour, and all things were prepared with
extraordinary diligence. He beheld the care of
the Captains in his Enemies Camp, how they did
ride up and down to ſet things in order: And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things that were but vain indeed (as the noiſe of
Men, the neighing of Horſes, and the gliſtering
of their Armour) troubled yet the minde that was
careful in expectation of the event: Therefore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were that he was not fully reſolved in his
minde, or elſe to prove the reſolutions of ſuch as
were about him, a Councel of War was called to
adviſe what was beſt to do. <hi>Parmenio,</hi> who was the
moſt experienced among all the Captains in the
feats of War, thought it good not to give his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
open Battel, but rather to ſet upon them in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:46658:75"/>
the dead time of the night, whereby he thought
they might eaſily be diſcomfited; ſuppoſing, that
they among whom there was ſuch diverſity of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms,
and alteration of Language, could never
rally well together, eſpecially when in the dead of
night they ſhould have their quarters beaten up;
whereas in the day time, the ſhape of the <hi>Scythians</hi>
and <hi>Bactrians,</hi> with their rough faces, and long hair,
beſide the hugeneſs of their bodies, ſhould appear
terrible. He alledged, how Souldiers were more
moved with the vain cauſes of fear, and ſuch as
were of no moment, then with ſuch as were juſt
cauſes indeed. He declared alſo, how their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
by reaſon of their great multitude, ſhould be
able to incloſe their ſmall number round about;
and that they ſhould not now fight in the <hi>Streights,</hi>
and narrow paſſages of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> but in an open and
large Plain.</p>
            <p>They all, in a manner, agreed to <hi>Parmenio;</hi> and
<hi>Polipercon</hi> was directly of Opinion, that the Victory
conſiſted on the following of that counſel. The
King, that before had upbraided <hi>Parmenio</hi> more bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
then was expedient, would not check him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
but beheld <hi>Polipercon,</hi> and ſaid:</p>
            <p>That Policy that you adviſe me, pertaineth to Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and Felons, for it is their propriety to work by
darkneſs and deceit; I will no more ſuffer, that either
<hi>Darius</hi> abſence, the ſtreightneſs of the ground, or the
ſtealth in the night, ſhall be an hinderance to my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
I am plainly determined to fight with him in the
open day; and had rather repent me of my Fortune,
then he aſhamed of my Victory: Beſides, this is to be
conſidered, that the <hi>Perſians</hi> keep good Watch, and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:46658:76"/>
ſtand armed always in a readineſs to receive us,
whereof I have advertiſement, ſo that they cannot be
deceived that way; therefore there doth remain no
more, but that you prepare your ſelves to the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.</p>
            <p>When he had by theſe words put them into cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
he diſmiſſed them from Counſel, to refreſh
their bodies. <hi>Darius</hi> conjecturing, that his Enemies
would have done that which <hi>Parmenio</hi> did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade,
cauſed the Horſes to ſtand ready bridled
the whole night, and the moſt part of his Hoſt to
continue armed, and to keep good watch. His
Camp ſhone bright with the fires that were made,
and he himſelf, with his Captains and Kinsfolks,
went about his Souldiers that ſtood in order and in
Arms, making invocation to the <hi>Sun,</hi> to <hi>Mars,</hi>
and to the <hi>Everlaſting Fire,</hi> that they would inſpire
into them a fortitude of minde, that might an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the Ancient Glory, and the Acts of their
Predeceſſors: And declared, if the minde of man
were able to conceive any tokens or ſignes of the
gods favour or aſſiſtance, it was no doubt but
that they were bent on their ſide, having already
ſtricken a ſudden fear amongſt the <hi>Macedons,</hi> which
(he ſaid) might be ſeen by their running here and
there, by the carrying and caſting off their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
and that the gods, which took care of the
<hi>Perſians</hi> Empire, were now determined to puniſh
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Cowards, whoſe Captains (quoth he) being

            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:46658:76"/>
The like care was amongſt the <hi>Macedons;</hi> for as
though the matter ſhould have been tryed that night,
they paſſed it over in doubt and fear. <hi>Alexander</hi>
himſelf (that was never ſeen in ſuch fear before
that time) called for <hi>Ariſtander</hi> to make vows and
prayers; who, in a white Garment, carrying <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benes</hi>
in his hand, with his head covered, went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the King, calling upon <hi>Jupiter, Minerva,</hi> and
<hi>Victoria.</hi> When he had thus performed his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
according to their Religion, he returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Pavilion to reſt the reſidue of the night; yet
he could neither reſt, nor ſleep, but continually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
with himſelf, which way he ſhould aſſail his
Enemies: One while he was of Opinion, to give his
firſt On-ſet upon that Battel of the <hi>Perſians</hi> that
ſhould come on his right hand, ſometimes he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to meet his Enemies in the very front,
and otherwhile whether it were better to encounter
them on their left Battel. At length his body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
heavy with the travel of his minde, and he
fell into a ſound ſleep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When the day appeared,
the Captains aſſembled about the Kings Pavilion,
to receive their charge, where they ſtood amazed
at the unaccuſtomed ſilence: For they could not
but wonder, that he who was ever wont to call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
other men, and to reprove ſuch as were ſlow or
negligent, not to be then ſtirring in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of the utmoſt danger: And many were of
opinion, that he ſlept not, but ſhrunk for fear; yet
for all that, none of them that were about his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
durſt attempt to wake him. In the mean ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the morning paſt away, and the Souldiers
might neither put on their Armour, nor ſtand in
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:46658:77"/>
order of Battel, without commandment of their
Chief. When they had thus tarried a great while,
<hi>Parmenio</hi> gave commandment that they ſhould fall
to meat. At length, when the time came, that of
neceſſity the Army muſt be drawn into Battel, he
entred into the Kings lodging, and called upon him
divers times by his name: but when he could not
awake him with his voice, he ſtirred him with
his hand, and ſaid:</p>
            <p>It is far forth day, and your Enemies come forwards
in order of Battel, and your Souldiers being yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed,
have not commandment given them what they
ſhould do: Where is that chearfulneſs and courage of
yours become, which were wont to ſtir up even thoſe
who were moſt watchful?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> made anſwer unto him:</p>
            <p>Think you that I could ſleep before that I had rid
my ſelf of the care that hindred me to take my reſt?
<hi>And thereupon cauſed the Trumpet to ſound to the
Battel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But when</hi> Parmenio <hi>continued ſtill in his admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that he in ſuch a time could ſleep ſo quietly:</hi>
It is no marvel (<hi>quoth</hi> Alexander) when <hi>Darius</hi> burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Country, waſted the Villages, and deſtroyed
the Victuals, I could then in no wiſe be quiet: But
now what cauſe have I to fear, ſeeing he now prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
himſelf to fight? He hath now fulfilled my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire;
reſort you where your charge lieth, and I will
ſtraightway come to give order amongſt you, and we
will diſpute this buſineſs afterwards.</p>
            <p>He uſed ſeldom to take his friends advice when
any doubt or danger was at hand. When <hi>Parmenio</hi>
was gone, he armed himſelf, and came forwards
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:46658:77"/>
amongſt his Souldiers: They ſeeing him look ſo
chearfully as they had not ſeen before time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the courage of his countenance a certain
hope of the Victory: Then he cauſed the Trenches
of his Camp to be caſt down, that the Souldiers
might have free paſſage forth; and in this manner
did ſet his Battels in order. The Horſemen, of
whom <hi>Clitus</hi> was Captain, were ſet in the wing on
his right-hand Battel, to whom he joyned <hi>Philotas,</hi>
and other Captains. The laſt Band of Horſemen
was <hi>Meleagers,</hi> which were next unto the ſquare
Battel of Footmen, that the <hi>Macedons</hi> name <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanx:</hi>
After the <hi>Phalanx,</hi> followed the <hi>Agaraſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
of whom <hi>Nicanor,</hi> the Son of <hi>Parmenia,</hi> was
Captain: <hi>Cenus,</hi> with his Band, was appointed to
be a Relief: <hi>Horeſtes</hi> and <hi>Linceſtes</hi> advanced next;
and after them <hi>Polipercon,</hi> that had the Rule of
the Strangers; and <hi>Phylagus,</hi> who had the Rule of
the <hi>Balacrons:</hi> And this was the order of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
Battel in the right wing, whereof <hi>Amintas</hi> was
Chief.</p>
            <p>In the left Battel, <hi>Craterus</hi> had the charge of the
<hi>Peloponneſian</hi> Horſemen; and with him alſo were
the Bands of the <hi>Achaians, Locrenſians,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeans;</hi>
and the hindmoſt Troops were the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> under <hi>Philip</hi> their Captain. Thus
the Horſemen covering the Foot, made the Front
of the Battel: And leſt their Enemies, through
their multitude, ſhould incloſe the Battel about,
he planted a great Force behinde for a Reſerve, and
ſet a Relief alſo upon the Wings; not in Front
with the reſt, but upon the ſides, to the intent,
that if the Enemies attempted to compaſs round
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:46658:78"/>
about the Battels, they ſhould be ready to keep
them in action.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that maintained the places of Reſerves,
were the <hi>Agrians,</hi> of whom <hi>Attalus</hi> was Captain,
and the Archers of <hi>Creet</hi> were joyned unto them:
Such as ſtood in the Rear of the Battel, were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to turn their faces from the Frontwards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that being in a readineſs every way, the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels
in every place ſhould be of an equal force.
They which ſtood with their faces contrariwiſe,
were the <hi>Illyrians,</hi> and the Mercenary Souldiers,
with the <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>acians</hi> that were light armed. Theſe
his Battels were ſo aptly ſet to move every way, that
ſuch as ſtood in the hinder parts could not be inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
about, but might every way make their Front;
ſo the Front, the Flanks, and the Rear, were all of
like force. When he had ſet his men in order after
this manner, he gave Commandment, that if the
<hi>Perſians</hi> ſhould attempt upon them with their Hook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Waggons with a cry, or noiſe, that then they
ſhould open their Battels, and receive them with
ſilence, not doubting but that they ſhould paſs
through without any harm, if no man did reſiſt
them: But if they ſhould come without any ſhout
or clamour, that then they themſelves ſhould make
a cry to fear the Horſes withal; and ſo with Pikes
thruſt them through on every ſide. They which
had the charge of Battels, were commanded to
extend them ſo much in bredth as poſſible they
might, leſt by ſtanding over-cloſe, they might be
environed; and yet not to ſtretch them ſo far out,
as to leave the Ranks void, and thin in the midſt.
The Carriage, and the Priſoners (amongſt whom
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:46658:78"/>
               <hi>Darius</hi> Mother was one) were ſet in the top of an
Hill, with a ſmall Guard about them. The charge
of the left Battel was committed unto <hi>Parmenio,</hi>
as was accuſtomed before-time, and <hi>Alexander</hi>
himſelf was in the Main Body.</p>
            <p>When they were drawn near to one another, one
<hi>Byon</hi> came flying from the <hi>Perſian</hi> Hoaſt in a full
gallop, and declared unto the King, that <hi>Darius</hi>
had planted iron Galtops where he thought his
Horſemen ſhould paſs; and by a certain ſigne, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him the place, becauſe it might be avoided:
<hi>Alexander</hi> willed the Fugitive to be kept ſafe, and
aſſembled all his Captains together, declaring the
matter, and exhorting them to make their Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
privy to the danger, for eſchewing the place
pointed out to them: But all that were in ſo great
an Army could not hear the warning given, the
noiſe of both Armies taking away the uſe of the
ears. But <hi>Alexander</hi> riding betwixt the Battels,
gave Exhortation to the Captains, and to all other
that were within hearing.</p>
            <p>He declared, that there was but one hazard re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
to them that had paſſed through ſo many
Countries in hope of the Victory, which they were
now ready to fight for: Thereupon he reduced to
their memory the Battels they had fought at the
River of <hi>Granike,</hi> in the Mountains of <hi>Cilicia;</hi> and
with what ſpeed they had paſſed over both <hi>Syria</hi>
and <hi>Egypt:</hi> The rehearſal whereof put them in
great hope, and did intice them forwards to the
deſire of glory. He ſhewed, that the <hi>Perſians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
withdrawn from their former flying, were now
compelled to fight of neceſſity, becauſe they could
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:46658:79"/>
fly no further; and how that three days together,
amazed for fear, they had remained ſtill in one
place with their Armour on their backs; of whoſe
deſpair (he ſaid) there could be no greater argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then that they had ſet on fire their own
Country, confeſſing all to be their Enemies that
they deſtroyed not. He exhorted them not to fear
the vain name of <hi>unknown Nations;</hi> for it was a
thing nothing pertinent, which were called <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
or which <hi>Caducians;</hi> for being unknown
Nations, it was a ſure token that they were men
of no valour, becauſe ſuch as be valiant could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be unknown in the world: And contrariwiſe,
Daſtards, when they come forth of their D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns, bring
nothing with them but names of men; whereas
you (quoth he) that be <hi>Macedons,</hi> have obtained by
your Vertue and Manhood, that there is no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
in the world ignorant of your Acts. He wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them to behold the evil order that was in their
Enemies Hoſt, of whom ſome had no weapon but
a Dart, others a Sling to caſt ſtones, and very few
had ſuch Armour as they ought to have: So that
though there was a great number on the other part,
yet he ſaid, they had more on their ſide when they
ſhould come to fight hand to hand; and that for
his part he would not require any man to adventure
himſelf, except he were an example to him of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
and Courage; for he aſſured them, that he
would be ſeen fighting with the foremoſt, knowing
that ſo many wounds as he ſhould get, ſhould be
ſo many ornaments to his perſon: He ſaid, they
themſelves knew that he would be no partaker of
the prey; but that it was ever his cuſtom, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:46658:79"/>
the rewards of his Victory upon the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
His former words he ſhewed to be ſpoken to
men of courage; but if any were of another tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
he was to inform them, that they were come
unto the place from whence they could not fly, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
left ſo many Countries behinde them which
they had paſſed over, and ſo many Rivers and
Mountains at their backs; ſo that now there was
no way to their own houſes and Native Country,
but ſuch as they muſt make open with their own
hands.</p>
            <p>This was the Exhortation he gave unto the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and to ſuch of the Souldiers as were next
unto him. <hi>Darius,</hi> that was in his left-hand Battel,
accompanied with a choice Band of Horſemen and
of Footmen, deſpiſed the ſmall number of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
their Battels appearing to him thin, and
void of men, when he ſaw their Wings ſtretched ſo
far abroad: He ſtood therefore on his Chariot on
high, and turning himſelf both on the right hand
and the left, he ſpake in this manner to ſuch as
were about him:</p>
            <p>We that were not long ſince Lords of all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
lying between <hi>Helleſpont</hi> and the Ocean Sea, are
compelled now to fight, not for Fame and Glory, but
for our Safeguard, and our Liberty, which chiefly is
to be eſteemed: This day ſhall either eſtabliſh or make
an end of the greateſt Empire that hath been in any
Age. At the River of <hi>Granike</hi> we fought with a ſmall
part of our Power: When we were vanquiſhed in <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia,
Syria</hi> was able to receive us, and the Rivers of
<hi>Tygris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates</hi> were as Bull-warks to defend
our Kingdom: But now we are come to that extremity,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:46658:80"/>
that we have no place to fly unto if we be put to
flight: All things behinde our backs are waſted with
this long War; neither Cities are inhabited, nor men
left to till the ground: Our Wives and our Children
do follow this Army, a prey ready for our Enemies,
except we put our bodies for the defence of ſuch as be
dear unto us. So much as hath concerned me, I have
performed, preparing ſuch an Army as this huge Plain
is able to receive. I have diſtributed amongſt you
Horſe and Armour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> providing that Victuals ſhould
not be wanting for ſuch a multitude, and have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
an apt place to arange our Battels in: All the reſt
remaineth in your hands; do but dare to fight, and
the Victory is yours; and deſpiſe you the Fame of the
Enemy, which is but a weak weapon againſt men of
Valour: It is raſhneſs which hitherto ye have feared as
a Vertue, whereof when the firſt brunt is ſpent, it wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
dull, as are Drones having once loſt their ſtings.
This Plain hath diſcloſed their ſmall number, which
the Mountains of <hi>Cilicia</hi> did hide: You ſee how emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
their Ranks are, how thin their Wings be extended
abroad, how their Battels be empty and void of men,
and ſuch as are in the Rear have already turned their
backs: They may be overthrown with your Horſes feet,
though I ſend none againſt them but the Hooked Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons:
And if we win the Battel, we make an end of
the War, for they have no place to fly to: They are ſhut
in with <hi>Tygris</hi> on the one ſide, and with <hi>Euphrates</hi> on
the other; and ſuch things as before made for their
purpoſe, now are turned, and do make clear againſt
them: Our Army is light, and without much Baggage,
and they are laden with preys and booties; we ſhall
kill them as they are wrapt in ſpoils: And the ſame
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:46658:80"/>
one thing ſhall be both our gain and the cauſe of our Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.
If any of you be moved with the Fame of the
Nation, you muſt think that the Armour, with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſhew, and not the bodies of the <hi>Macedons,</hi> are
there preſent; we have conſumed ſo much of their blood
ſince the War began: And ſeeing they are but few,
their loſs muſt needs be to them the greater. For how
great ſoever <hi>Alexander</hi> doth ſeem to them that are Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
he is but a man, and if you truſt me, both raſh
and without conſideration; and hitherto more fortunate
through our fear, then by his own valour. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can continue that is not governed by reaſon; for
though Fortune ſeems to favour for a while, yet at laſt
ſhe will not ſupport his raſhneſs: Beſides that, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
of things are full of change, and no man hath a
perpetual felicity. It may be that the providence of
the gods have ſo ordained it, that the Empire of the
<hi>Perſians,</hi> encreaſed with ſuch proſperous ſucceſs by the
ſpace of two hundred and thirty years, and brought to
ſo great a height of fortune, ſhould now rather be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
then utterly overthrown, thereby to admoniſh us
of mans fragility, who uſeth to forget himſelf over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
in proſperous eſtate. It is not long ago, ſince of
our own motion and courage, we made War againſt the
<hi>Grecians,</hi> and invaded their Dominions; but now
we ſtand at defence for our own Country. Thus we are
toſſed one againſt another by change of Fortune; for
one Nation cannot ſuffice the greatneſs of the Empire
which we both do covet: But be it ſo that hope were
taken from us, yet neceſſity ought to encourage us, the
War is brought to ſuch extremity. He keepeth now as
Priſoners, both my Mother, my two Daughters, and <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
my Son, born to the ſucceſſion of this Empire: He
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:46658:81"/>
keepeth Captive your Prince, the Iſſue that is deſcended
of the Blood-Royal; yea, and your Captains equal
with Kings; and if you do not now beſtir your hands,
I my ſelf am like to become a Captive: Deliver you
therefore my Bowels out of Priſon, and reſtore to me
my Children, for whoſe ſake I do not refuſe to die.
Be you all ſure, that both my Mother and my Children
(for my Wife is dead in Priſon) are holding up their
hands, crying unto the gods, and calling for your help,
your courage and fidelity, that you would free them
from Servitude, from Fetters, and from the Eſtate they
are in, living at other mens will and appointment.
Think you that they can be content to live under ſuch,
as they could ſcarcely vouchſafe to have for their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects?
I ſee that our Enemies Battels do approach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
the nearer the danger is at hand, the leſs the words I
have ſpoken do ſatisfie me. I make requeſt to you by
the gods of our Country, by the Eternal Fire that is
carried upon their Altars, by the brightneſs of the Sun
that riſeth within the bound<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s of my Empire, and by
the everlaſting memory of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who did take the
Empire from the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Lydians,</hi> and gave it to
the <hi>Perſians,</hi> to deliver their Names and this Nation
from ſhame and reproach. Go forth chearfully, have
you good hope, and ſee that you reſtore to your Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
the glory you received of your Predeceſſours. Behold,
you carry in your hands your Liberty, your Help, our
Hope in time to come. Whoſoever contemneth death
eſcapeth it, and death only overtaketh ſuch as do flie
from it. I ride here in a Chariot, not only for that it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
is my Countries Cuſtom, but alſo that I may be ſeen of
you all: And I deſir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> nothing ſo much, as that you will

or of Cowardlineſs.</p>

In the mean ſeaſon, whileſt <hi>Alexander</hi> did covet
to eſchew the place of peril whereof he was adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed,
and inforced himſelf to encounter with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
left Battel, where he remained in perſon, he
was compelled to fetch a compaſs about; whom
when <hi>Darius</hi> perceived, he turned likewiſe his
own Battel towards him; willing <hi>Beſſus,</hi> to appoint
the Horſe of the <hi>Maſſagetae,</hi> to give a Charge on
<hi>Alexanders</hi> left Battel. He ſent before him his Hook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Wagons, which by a ſigne given, brake ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon their Enemies with a full courſe, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
that by their coming unawares, they might
work the greater deſtruction. The Pikes that were
ſet before in the Wagons, deſtroyed divers, and
many were torn aſunder by the Hooks that were on
both ſides: The <hi>Macedons</hi> gave not place to them
by a little and little, but troubled their Array with
a main flight. When <hi>Mazeus</hi> ſaw their diſorder,
he put them in more fear, and appointed a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Horſemen to fetch a compaſs about the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi>
Battels to ſpoil their Carriage, ſuppoſing that
the Priſoners which were there kept would break
their Bands when they ſhould ſee their own Nation
approach: <hi>Parmenio,</hi> who was in the left Wing,
did eaſily perceive it, and immediately ſent <hi>Polida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
unto <hi>Alexander,</hi> to ſhew him the danger, and
know his pleaſure what he would have done: which
when he underſtood by <hi>Polidamus; Go thy way</hi>
(quoth he) <hi>and ſhew</hi> Parmenio, <hi>if we win the Battel,
we ſhall not only recover again our own, but ſhall have
alſo the Spoil of our Enemies: Therefore I would not
that any part of our Force ſhould be removed out of
the Main Battel, but let him fight it out manfully,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:46658:82"/>
and not regard the loſs of Baggage; wherein he ſhall
obſerve the Honour of me, and my Father</hi> Philip, <hi>whoſe
Cuſtom was to do the like.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean ſeaſon, the <hi>Perſians</hi> were entred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Carriages, and had ſlain divers that were
left there in defence thereof: whereupon the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
began to unlooſe themſelves; and taking up
whatſoever came to hand, took part with the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and ſharply aſſailed the <hi>Macedons;</hi> divers
were ſo joyful, that they ran to bear tydings to
<hi>Siſigambis,</hi> how <hi>Darius</hi> had won the Victory, and
had overthrown his Enemies with a great ſlaughter,
and alſo that their Carriages were taken, thinking
the like Fortune had been every where, ſeeing they
ſaw the <hi>Perſians</hi> fall to ſpoil. And although they
exhorted <hi>Siſigambis</hi> that ſhe ſhould leave her hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs,
and rejoyce, yet ſhe continued in the ſame
Eſtate ſhe was in before, without ſpeaking one
word, or changing colour or countenance, but
ſate ſtill immoveable: She was ſo overcome (as it
was thought) with ſudden joy, that ſhe durſt not
ſtir, nor attempt Fortune; for ſuch as did behold
her, could not perceive which way ſhe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined.
In the mean ſeaſon, <hi>Amintas</hi> that was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the Horſe to <hi>Alexander,</hi> came with a few
Bands of Horſemen to relieve the Carriages; but
uncertain it was whether he did it of his own head,
or by the Kings appointment: He was not able to
endure the force of the <hi>Caduſians</hi> and <hi>Scythians;</hi>
for ſcarcely attempting the skirmiſh, he was driven
back, and fled again unto <hi>Alexander,</hi> being a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
rather of the loſs of the Carriages, then a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuer
of the ſame. The grief that <hi>Alexander</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:46658:82"/>
at this matter, overcame the purpoſe he
took before in hand, and feared (not without cauſe)
leſt the Souldiers, through the carefulneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
their own, might leave the fight, and reſort
towards their Baggage: He ſent <hi>Arctes,</hi> Captain of
the Spearmen that were nam'd <hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Scythians.</hi> By this time the Hooked Waggons,
which had before troubled the fore-front, were come
within the ſquare (which the <hi>Macedons</hi> call <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanx</hi>)
yet the Souldiers never ſhrunk at the matter,
but received them into the midſt of their Battel;
whereas joyning themſelves cloſe together, they
ſtood like a wall on both ſides, thruſting their Pikes
into the Bowels of the Horſes; and ran about the
Waggons, throwing down ſuch as ſtood in them at
defence. The whole Battel was intangled and
troubled with the ruine and killing of the Horſes,
with ſuch as governed them: They could not rule
their Horſes when they were once galled or hurt;
who with much leaping and ſtrugling, not only
brake out of their Traces, but alſo overthrew the
Waggons, drawing at their Tails the men that were
ſlain; neither being able to ſtand ſtill for the fear
they were in, nor yet go forwards, being ſo faint
of their wounds: Yet a few of them paſſed through
the Battel; whereby ſuch as the Waggons did light
upon, were miſerably ſlain, lying upon the ground
with their Members cut in ſunder: Yet becauſe
that through the greenneſs of their wounds they
felt little pain, they kept their Weapons ſtill, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
they were maimed, and without
ſtrength, till ſuch time as, by continual bleeding,
they ſunk down dead. <hi>Aretes,</hi> in the mean time, had
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:46658:83"/>
ſlain the Captain of the <hi>Scythians</hi> that were ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Carriages, and repulſed them back:
But ſtraightway came the <hi>Bactrians,</hi> by <hi>Darius</hi> ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and turned the fortune of the Field again.
Many <hi>Macedons</hi> were ſlain at the firſt encounter,
but more fled unto <hi>Alexander:</hi> Then the <hi>Perſians</hi>
made ſuch a ſhout as men are wont to do that win
the Victory, and fiercely aſſailed their Enemies,
thinking they had in evey place been put to flight.
When <hi>Alexander</hi> perceived his men ſhrink, and
begin to faint, and give ground, he rebuked ſuch
as he ſaw afraid, and encouraged many that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
from the fight; ſo that he alone reſtored the
Battel again. When he had put them in heart, he
required them to preſs forwards, and go freely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their Enemies. <hi>Alexander</hi> perceiving that
the <hi>Bactrians</hi> were departed to the defeating of the
Carriages, and by their going had left the right-hand
Battel of <hi>Darius</hi> thin and naked, he bent his
force wholly that way, and there made a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſlaughter and deſtruction of his Enemies, who
by reaſon of their looſe Array, were not able to
withſtand him; which the <hi>Perſians</hi> in the left wing
obſerving, were in hope to have incloſed <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
round, and came forwards to ſet upon his Rear,
whereby great danger had enſued to him, being
invironed both before and behinde, if the <hi>Agrians</hi>
had not put their Spurs to their Horſes, and given a
gallant Charge to their Enemies that were inviron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King about, and ſo compelled the <hi>Perſians</hi>
to turn their faces again towards them.</p>
            <p>The Battels thus were ſore travelled on both
ſides; <hi>Alexander</hi> had his Foes both before and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:46658:83"/>
and his Enemies that come on his back were
ſore oppreſſed by the <hi>Agrians:</hi> The <hi>Bactrians</hi> alſo
that had ſpoiled the Carriages, were excluded from
their own company, and could not recover their
place again. Thus the Battels were divided in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
parts, and fought one againſt another, as their
chance fell out. The two Kings, that joyned their
Battel hard to one another, renewed again the fight:
There were moſt of the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſlain; but the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the wounded were li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e on both ſides: <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
did ride in a Chariot, and <hi>Alexander</hi> upon a
Horſe: They both had a choice Band about them,
which were careleſs of their own lives; for if their
Kings ſhould miſcarry, they neither could be ſafe,
nor yet deſire to live. Wherefore every one of
them thought it a Noble thing to adventure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
before the face of their Prince; and he that
coveted moſt to defend his Maſter, was in moſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril;
for each man deſired the honour to kill the
King of the contrary part. There (whether it were
an imagination of the eyes, or viſible indeed) ſuch
as were about <hi>Alexander</hi> believed, that they ſaw an
Eagle fluttering above his head, which neither
feared with the claſhing of their Harneſs, nor by
the crying of them that were dying, hovered ſtill
in the Air a little above him. Then <hi>Ariſtander,</hi> who
did wear a white garment, and carried Lawrel in
his hand, ſhewed this ſight unto the Soaldiers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
buſie in the fight, as a certain token of Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
This ſight cauſed them, which before were in
ſome doubt, chearfully and with great confidence
to aſſail their Enemies.</p>
            <p>The fight continued after this ſort until the time
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:46658:84"/>
that he was ſlain who governed the Horſe that drew
<hi>Darius</hi> Chariot: Then neither the <hi>Perſians</hi> nor
<hi>Macedons</hi> doubted, but tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Darius</hi> had been ſlain:
And the <hi>Perſians,</hi> upon that imagination, made a

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rbarous noiſe, and a ſorrowful howling, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they ſore troubled and aſtonied their whole
Hoaſt, that were yet fighting with equal Victory:
<hi>Darius</hi> Kinſmen, and the Squires of his Body that
were on his left hand, left him, and fled away
with a main flight: but ſuch as ſtood in his defence
on his right hand, conveyed him into the heart of
the Battel.</p>
            <p>It was ſaid that <hi>Darius</hi> drew out his Sword, and
was determined divers times to kill himſelf, rather
then to ſuſtain the ſhame of flying away: But
when he ſaw, as he ſate aloft on his Chariot, that a
great part of his Army remained yet fighting, he
was aſhamed to leave them in ſuch ſort. And while
he thus wavered in his own minde, the <hi>Perſians</hi>
by little and little gave ground, and ſhrunk from
their order. <hi>Alexander</hi> that had tyred many Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
did at that inſtant change his Horſe anew, and
ſtrake at the faces of them that did oppoſe: there
was none then that made reſiſtance any longer, but
a manifeſt ſlaughter fell on the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
turned his Chariot to fly away: The <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dans</hi>
purſued hard after them that fled; and the
duſt that flew up to the Sky took away their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
ſo that they wandred as in darkneſs, and
ever drew together when they heard any voice they
knew; only the ratling and noiſe of the Chariots
was a taken for the <hi>Macedons</hi> to follow in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:46658:84"/>
As Fortune was proſperous to the <hi>Macedons</hi> on
this part, and contrary unto their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; ſo on
the other ſide, where <hi>Parmenio</hi> in the left wing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
with the <hi>Perſians,</hi> they had the better,
and the <hi>Macedons</hi> the worſe. <hi>Mazeus</hi> with his
whole Band gave a violent charge, and put the
Horſemen that ſtood in the wings to a ſore diſtreſs;
and thereupon, by reaſon he abounded with mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
he began to incloſe the Footmen round.
Then <hi>Parmenio</hi> ſent word to <hi>Alexander</hi> in what
danger they were; which he ſignified to be ſuch,
that except they had ſuccour in time, they could
not reſiſt, but be inforced to fly away. <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
was gone far in the Chaſe when this ſorrowful
meſſage was brought him; wherefore he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Horſemen to ſtand, and chafed wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that the Victory ſhould be thus taken out of his
hands, and that <hi>Darius</hi> had better fortune in fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
then he in following. In the mean ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſon, the
fame of <hi>Darius</hi> overthrow was brought unto <hi>Maze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
wherefore, though before he had the upper hand,
yet he was ſo ſtricken with fear at his Fellows miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
that he made a ſlack purſuit upon their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
<hi>Parmenio</hi> was ignorant of the cauſe why
the fight did ſlack ſo willingly on their part; and
boldly uſing the occaſion, called the <hi>Theſſalian</hi>
Horſemen unto him, and ſaid: <hi>See you not how
our Enemies, that even now gave us a fierce on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſuddenly be afraid? I ſee the fortune of our King
doth give us the Victory: All the Field is ſtrowed
with the</hi> Perſians <hi>that be ſlain; Why do you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſtay? Are you not good enough for men that
fly?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:46658:85"/>
They ſaw that his words had ſome appearance of
truth; and therefore by and by they took courage,
and putting their Spurs to their Horſes, gave a
full charge upon their Enemies; who retired not
by little and little, but marched away a great pace;
and they wanted nothing of flying, ſaving that
they had not yet directly turned their backs: yet
for all that, in ſo much as <hi>Parmenio</hi> knew not what
was become of the King, nor of his Battel, he
ſtayed, and would not purſue after them. <hi>Mazeus</hi>
having liberty given him to fly at his leiſure, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the River of <hi>Tire,</hi> not the next way, but by a
further compaſs about with more ſurety, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the City of <hi>Babylon</hi> with the remainder of that
vanquiſhed Army.</p>
            <p>In the mean ſeaſon, <hi>Darius,</hi> with a few that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
him in his ſlight, came to the River of
<hi>Licus,</hi> where paſſing over, he ſtood in doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he ſhould break the Bridge or no; for it was
ſhewed him, that his Enemies were at hand: but
conſidering how many thouſands of his men by the
breaking thereof ſhould become a prey to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
he left the Bridge ſtanding; and at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
ſaid, <hi>That he had rather open the way to them
that purſued him, then to ſhut it againſt them that fled
after him.</hi> But <hi>Darius</hi> left not his flying till he came
to <hi>Arbella,</hi> where he arrived about mid-night:
Who is able to conceive in his minde, or expreſs
in words, the manifold chance in this diſcomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the ſlaughter that fell both upon Captains
and Souldiers; the chaſing of them that were put
to flight, and the deſtruction in general, and in
particular; Fortune heaped together in that one
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:46658:85"/>
day the chances of the whole world. Some took
the way that came next to hand; others fled into
the Woods, and ſought out by-ways to eſcape ſuch
as had them in the chaſe: There was a confuſion
of Horſemen and Footmen mixed together withou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
any head; the armed with the unarmed, and the
whole with the hurt.</p>
            <p>At length, the compaſſion that one had of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
was turned into fear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they that could not
follow, were left bewailing themſelves one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
But Thirſt chiefly afflicted the wounded and
wearied, who lay along every where in the ways
where any water was, gaſping after it with open
mouth; and when for greedineſs they had gulled
in the troubled water, they began to ſwell, when
the Mud once entred into their Intrails; and being
thus not in caſe to move, the Enemy came and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them up with freſh wounds. Some; when the
Brooks near hand were taken up by others, ſought
out for Springs in every ſecret place: Nor were
there any Puddles ſo dry, or ſo far out of the way,
that could be hidden from the thirſt of them that
ſearched them out: The old men and women were
heard howling and crying in all the Villages near
the way ſide, how <hi>Darius</hi> was yet their King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> (as it hath been ſaid before) purſuing
the Chaſe, was come to the River of <hi>Licus,</hi> at which
the multitude of the Flyers were more then could
paſs the Bridge; ſo that many, when their Enemies
purſued them, leaped into the water; and there la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with their Armour, and wearied with ſighting
and flying, were conſumed in the ſtream: But
within a while, neither the Bridge nor the River
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:46658:86"/>
were able to receive the throung that continually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
by their indiſcreet flying: For when fear
had once entred into their hearts, they doubted only
that which put them firſt in fear. The <hi>Macedons</hi>
were very eager in purſuit of their Enemies, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<hi>Alexander,</hi> that he would not ſuffer his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to eſcape free away: But he to ſtay them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
that their weapons were dull, their hands
wearied, their bodies faint in the long purſuit, and
the night beſides faſt approached on them: But in
very deed, the care of his other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Battel, which he
thought to be yet fighting, cauſed him to return to
their ſuccour.</p>
            <p>He had not ſo ſoon turned his Enſignes, but that
certain Horſemen brought him word from <hi>Parme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi>
that he likewiſe had put his Enemies to flight.
He was not in ſo great danger all that day, as when
he was coming towards his Camp; for there were
but few that followed him, and they were out of
order, as men that rejoycing of the Victory, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all their Enemies either to be fled, or ſlain in the
Field: Suddenly there appeared a Band of <hi>Perſian</hi>
Horſemen coming againſt them, which at the firſt
ſtayed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but afterwards perceiving the ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the <hi>Macedons,</hi> gave a charge upon them.
The King rode foremoſt, rather diſſembling then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing
the peril he was in: But his perpetual felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
never failed him in his extremities; for at the firſt
encounter, he ſtrake the Captain of the <hi>Perſians</hi>
(who in eagerneſs of the fight unadviſedly came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him) through with a Spear. When he with
that blow was ſtricken to the ground, <hi>Alexander</hi>
ſlew the next unto him with the ſame Staff; and
after him, divers others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:46658:86"/>
When his Company ſaw their Enemies amazed
with his doings, they brake upon them, and threw
many to the earth; yet they, for their parts, were
not unrevenged: for the whole Battel did not ſo
earneſtly fight, as that ſmall Band aſſembled ſo by
chance. But at length, when they ſaw flying in
the dark to be more ſafe unto them then fighting,
they fled away in divers Companies. <hi>Alexander</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
eſcaped this extraordinary peril, brought his
men in ſafeguard unto his Camp.</p>
            <p>There were ſlain of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> which came to
the knowledge of them that had the Victory, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thouſand; and of the <hi>Macedons,</hi> leſs then three
hundred: which Victory <hi>Alexander</hi> won more by
his own Vertue, then by any fortune; and with
hardineſs and courage, more then through any
advantage of the ground: for he both ordered his
Battels politickly, and fought manfully: With great
wiſdom he contemned the loſs of the Baggage, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the weight of the whole matter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in the Battel it ſelf. Whileſt the fortune of the
Field remained doubtful, he uſed himſelf as aſſured
of the Victory; and when he had put his Enemies
in fear, he ceaſed not till he had ſet them flying:
and that which ſcarcely can be believed, in that
fierceneſs of courage, he purſued in the Chaſe more
wiſely then greedily: For if he ſhould have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
on ſtill, part of his Power yet fighting in the
Field, he ſhould either have loſt the Battel through
his own fault, or elſe have won the Victory
through the proweſs of another: Or if after he
had obtained the Victory, he had ſhewed himſelf
afraid of the Horſemen that he met, he muſt either
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:46658:87"/>
ſhamefully have fled, or have been miſerably
ſlain.</p>
            <p>Nor were his Captains to be defrauded of their
due commendation, for the wounds that they did
receive were tokens of their Manhood; <hi>Epheſtions</hi>
arm was wounded with a Spear, <hi>Perdicas, Cenos,</hi>
and <hi>Medinas,</hi> with ſhot of Arrows, were almoſt
ſlain out-right: And if we will give a true judgment
of the <hi>Macedons</hi> that were there, we muſt confeſs,
that he was a King worthy of ſuch Miniſters, and
they men worthy of ſo great a Maſter.</p>

            <p>IF I ſhould here make mention of the Wars that in

and in <hi>Thracia,</hi> and of the Revolters that were check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and ſubdued by the appointment and Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the proceedings in <hi>Aſia</hi> would
thereby be interrupted, which I thought moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to put wholly together, until the death of
<hi>Darius;</hi> and then to joyn them in this work, as they
agree with the time. I will firſt ſpeak of thoſe
things that enſued after the Battel of <hi>Arbella,</hi> where
<hi>Darius</hi> arrived about mid-night; and, as it chanced,
the greater part of his friends, whom he called all
together, and ſpake to them to this effect:</p>
            <p>That he doubted not but <hi>Alexander</hi> and his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
greedy of the abundance of the ſpoil which was
in a readineſs for them, would viſit ſuch Cities and
Countries of his as were moſt famous for their ſcituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and wealth; which thing, <hi>he ſaid,</hi> conſidering his
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:46658:88"/>
eſtate, could not but turn at length to his advantage.
His purpoſe was, in a ſwift March, to repair into the
Deſarts: And ſeeing the uttermoſt bounds of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
were yet untouched, he might eaſily repair his
Power from thence to renew the War.</p>
            <p>Let therefore that greedy Nation (<hi>quoth he</hi>) take
my Treaſure, and ſatisfie their hunger with gold, which
ſhortly ſhall cauſe both the ſame, and themſelves alſo,
to be a prey unto us: For (<hi>he ſaid</hi>) he had learned by
experience, that the Flocks of Concubines and Eunuchs,
were nothing elſe but burdens and impediments; which
<hi>Alexander</hi> poſſeſſing, and carrying about with him, it
would at the laſt make him inferiour unto them of
whom before he was Victorious.</p>
            <p>His Oration ſeemed to all men to be full of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation;
for they ſaw thereby, that the rich City
of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould be given up unto the <hi>Macedons,</hi>
and <hi>Suſae</hi> ſhortly after, with all other Ornaments of
the Realm, which were the cauſe of the War: But
he proceeded in perſwading them, how that men
in adverſity ought not to do things that ſhould ſeem
goodly in the ſpeaking, but neceſſary in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience:
That Wars were made with Iron, and
not with Gold; with men, and not with the walls
of Cities: for all things follow them that are arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and in ſtrength. He ſhewed, that his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,
famous for their Atchievements, were afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
after this manner, in the beginning, and yet
recovered quickly again their former eſtate. After
he had ſpoken theſe words, either for that they were
thereby incouraged, or elſe that they rather obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Authority, then liked his Counſel, they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him into the bounds of <hi>Media.</hi> Shortly after,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:46658:88"/>
               <hi>Arbella</hi> was delivered up to <hi>Alexander,</hi> which was
full of Treaſure, and precious Moveables; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
the pay of the whole Army was left there.
The ſickneſs that began in <hi>Alexanders</hi> Camp, ariſing
from the favour of the dead bodies which were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
over all the Fields, was the cauſe that he did
the ſooner remove. The plain Country of <hi>Arabia,</hi>
famous with the abundance of ſweet Odours there
growing, lay upon the right hand as they marched:
And ſo paſſing through the Country lying between
<hi>Tygris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which is ſo fat and plentiful a
ground, that the Inhabitants are fain to drive their
Beaſts from feeding, leſt a Surfeit ſhould deſtroy
them. The cauſe of this fertility, cometh by the
moiſture that iſſueth from both Rivers, ſweating by
veins, through the ground. Both theſe Rivers have
their beginnings in the Mountains of <hi>Armenia,</hi>
where they are diſtant twenty five hundred furlongs;
and ſo run forwards, keeping their diſtance, till they
come near unto the bounds of <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Gordia:</hi>
For there, by little and little, they draw more near
together, leaving leſs ſpace betwixt them. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe
on both ſides the Country that is called <hi>Meſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia,</hi>
from whence they run, through the bounds
of <hi>Babylon,</hi> into the <hi>Red Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After <hi>Alexander</hi> had changed his Camp four
times, he came to a City called <hi>Memnium,</hi> where
there is a Fountain within a Cave, that belcheth out
great plenty of Pitch: So that it appears the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi>
had their Cement from thence, which they
imployed about the making of their walls of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
bredth and compaſs. As <hi>Alexander</hi> was
going from thence towards <hi>Babylon, Mazeus,</hi> who
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:46658:89"/>
was ſaid before to have fled from the Battel, came to
meet him in moſt humble manner; whereas com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
his Children into his hands, he yeilded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and rendred up the City. His coming was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
grateful unto the King, conſidering what travel
he ſhould have ſuſtained in the ſiege of ſo ſtrong a
City, if it had been kept againſt him: And beſides,
for ſo much as <hi>Mazeus</hi> was a man both famous and
valiant, and much commended for his atchievements
in the laſt Battel, and conceived his example ſhould
provoke others to do the like, he received both him
and his Children in gentle manner; and yet gave
order to his men, that they ſhould enter into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in ſuch Array of Battel, as if they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
to fight. A great number of the <hi>Babylonians</hi>
ſtood upon the walls, deſirous to behold him that
was their new King; but the moſt part went forth
to meet him. <hi>Bagiſtines</hi> that was Captain of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
and Keeper of the Kings Treaſure, becauſe he
would ſhew himſelf to be no leſs affectionate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Alexander</hi> then <hi>Mazeus</hi> was, ſtrowed all the
ways, where he ſhould paſs, with Flowers and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,
and ſet Altars of Silver on both ſides, with
Frankincenſe burning upon the ſame, and all other
kinde of ſweet odours. Next unto him came Droves
of Beaſts, great number of Horſes, with Lyons and
Pardals lying in their Dens, which he brought as
Preſents to give unto <hi>Alexander;</hi> and after them
the Wiſe Men, ſinging according to their Country
manner: The <hi>Caldeans</hi> followed next, with their
Diviners and Prophets; and then the Muſitians with
ſeveral kindes of Inſtruments, whoſe property was
to ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the praiſes of their Kings; and the <hi>Calde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:46658:89"/>
who uſed to declare the motion of the Planets,
with the courſe and revolution of the times. Laſt,
in order, came the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Horſemen, whoſe
ſumptuous furniture, both for themſelves and their
Horſes, tended more to voluptuouſneſs and delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
then to any magnificence. <hi>Alexander,</hi> that was
incloſed about with armed men, willed that the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians</hi>
ſhould come behinde his Footmen; and he
riding aloft in his Chariot, entred into the City,
and afterwards into the Palace; where, the next
day, he ſurveyed <hi>Darius</hi> his Wardrobe, and his
Treaſures. The beauty and pleaſantneſs of that
City gave juſt occaſion to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and ſuch as
were with him, to admire it much: <hi>Semiramis</hi> was
the Builder thereof; or as ſome affirm, <hi>Belus,</hi> whoſe
Palace is to be ſeen there: The walls are made with
Brick, interlined with Fitch; they are thirty two
foot in bredth; ſo that two Carts may eaſily go up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them on front: They are in height one hundred
Cubits, and the Towers are ten foot higher then
the Walls; the compaſs of the whole work about,
is three hundred ſixty eight furlongs, being build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(as it is left in memory) in ſo many days: The
houſes ſtand the bredth of an Acre diſtant from the
walls; they are contiguous, houſe to houſe, by the
ſpace of ninety furlongs; in other places not joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
near to one another, but for ſome conſiderations
ſo divided aſunder. The reſt of the ground is ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and tilled; to the intent, that if any Forreign
Power come againſt them, they ſhould be able to be
relieved by the fruit thereof. The River of <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
doth run through the midſt of the City, and is
kept in on both ſides with walls of a wonderful
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:46658:90"/>
workmanſhip: But the great Channels made of
Brick, and faſtened with Pitch inſtead of Mortar,
and wrought low within the ground, to receive the
violence of the Stream, do exceed all the reſt of the
works there made: for except the ſame were of
quantity and largeneſs to receive the water when
the Stream floweth over the Banks that are made to
keep it in, its violence would beat down the houſes
of the City. There is alſo over the River a ſtrong
Bridge, which joyneth both parts of the City toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
counted amongſt the marvellous works of the
Orient: For becauſe that <hi>Euphrates</hi> is ſo full of
Sand and Owſe, there can hardly ground be found
to lay that Foundation upon; and the Stream be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
caſteth up ſuch heaps of Sand againſt the
Bridge, that it is an impediment for the water free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to paſs; and therefore the River beateth upon the
Bridge with greater force, then if it had his free
courſe.</p>
            <p>There is alſo a Caſtle that is twenty furlongs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
the Towers whereof are thirty foot deep
within the ground, and fourſcore foot in height
above the ground; where alſo the Wonders are to
be ſeen ſo often mentioned in the <hi>Greek</hi> Poets: for
in the ſame are whole Groves of Trees ſet by won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Art, as if hanging in the Air, and ſo high as
are the tops of the Towers, which Trees are
marvellouſly beautiful and pleaſant through their
height and ſhadow which they make: The whole
weight of them is ſuſtained and borne up by huge
Pillars made of Stone, upon which there is a Floor
of ſquare ſtone, that both upholdeth the Earth
that lieth deep on the Pillar, and alſo the humour
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:46658:90"/>
wherewith it is watred. The trees that grow
thereupon are eight cubits about, and as fruitful
as if they grew on natural Earth. And although
that proceſs of time by little and little doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſtroy things made with hands, but alſo the
very works of nature: yet this work, for all it is
oppreſſed with the roots of ſo many trees, and
burthened with the weight of ſo much earth, doth
yet remain unperiſhed, being ſuſtained up with
twenty broad walls diſtant eleven foot one from
another. When theſe trees are ſeen afar off, they
ſeem to be a wood growing upon a mountain. It
is ſaid that the King of <hi>Syria</hi> reigning in <hi>Babylon,</hi>
builded this work for his wives fancy, who for the
love ſhe had to Groves and ſhadowy places, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
her Husband in doing thereof to counterfeit the
pleaſantneſs of nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> tarried longer here then in any other
City, which corrupted more the diſcipline of the
<hi>Macedons</hi> in their Wars then any other place. For
nothing was more licentious then the manners and
cuſtomes of the City; nor was any other place
more abundantly furniſhed of all things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
men are allured and ſtirred to exceſs of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
The Parents and Husbands were contented
that their children and wives ſhould for gain em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
ſuch ſtrangers as came amongſt them. The
Kings and Nobility of <hi>Perſia</hi> delight much in
plays and banquetting, but the <hi>Babylonians</hi> are
ſpecially addicted unto wine and drunkenneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
where the women uſe a cuſtome, that in the
beginning of the Feaſt their apparel ſeemeth civil
and demure; but afterwards by little and little
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:46658:91"/>
they put off their uppermoſt garments, and laying
aſide all modeſty, they at laſt diſcover themſelves
naked. Which vile cuſtome is not uſed by harlots
only, but by all women in general, who eſteem
the making of their bodies common but civility
and good manners: in this voluptuouſneſs the
Conquerour of <hi>Aſia</hi> wallowed by the ſpace of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
four days, whereby he became much the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
to have done other enterprizes, if there had
been an enemy to have ſtood againſt him. But to
the intent the damage ſhould be the leſs perceived,
he increaſed his power with a new ſupply out of
<hi>Macedonia.</hi> For <hi>Amintas</hi> the ſon of <hi>Andr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

brought him from <hi>Antipater</hi> ſix thouſand footmen,
and five hundred horſemen, and with them five
hundred of the <hi>Thracian</hi> horſemen, and thirty
five hundred footmen of the ſame Nation. He had
alſo out of <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> four thouſand footmen, and
four hundred eighty horſemen, being all mercenary
Souldiers. <hi>Amintas</hi> alſo brought him fifty of the
young men of the Nobility of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
upon <hi>Alexanders</hi> perſon: whoſe office it was
to ſerve the King at Table, and to bring him his
horſe when he went to Battel. They accuſtomed
to be about him when he hunted, and kept watch
by courſe at his chamber-door. Theſe were they
who afterwards proved great Captains, and out
of whoſe lions the Rulers of the men of War did
come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> appointed <hi>Agathon</hi> Captain of the
Caſtle of <hi>Babylon,</hi> with ſeven hundred <hi>Macedons,</hi>
and three hundred mercenary Souldiers, and left

               </gap> and <hi>Apolidorus</hi> Governours of the City
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:46658:91"/>
and Countrey, to whom he aſſigned two thouſand
footmen, and one thouſand Talents, giving them
Commiſſion to levy more Souldiers. He made
<hi>Mazeus</hi> that gave the City into his hands, Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of the whole, and cauſed <hi>Bagiſtines</hi> that yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
up the Caſtle to follow him in his Wars. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia</hi>
was given to <hi>Mithrenes</hi> that betrayed the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Sardis;</hi> and to encourage his men to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
new atchievements, he gave out of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of <hi>Babylon</hi> to every <hi>Macedon</hi> Horſeman five
hundred D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>niers, to every Horſeman of the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
five hundred, and to every Footman two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.
When he had ſet all theſe things in order,
he came into the Countrey called <hi>Atrapene,</hi> which
being plentiful of all things, and abounding in
Victuals, cauſed the King to tarry the longer
there.</p>
            <p>And leſt idleneſs ſhould be any abatement to the
courage of his men, he contrived a way to ſtir up
their ſpirits, and to keep them occupied, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
Judges to try out ſuch as had ſhewed
themſelves moſt valiant in the Wars, to whom he
aſſigned Rewards due to their deſervings. There
were Eight found out, whoſe manhood appeared
above the reſt, and the charge of one thouſand
Men was committed to every one of them, who
were then called <hi>Chiliarchi:</hi> this was the firſt time
they put one Thouſand into a Regiment; for before
this they were divided only into five hundred,
which was not counted any great preferment, or
reward of ſervice. The number of them were
great that came to plead their right in this behalf;
who before the Judges that gave ſentence, brought
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:46658:92"/>
in a teſtimony of their atchievements, whereby it
could not be unknown which of them had juſtly
purchaſed ſuch honour or not. The firſt place was
adjudged to the elder <hi>Adarchias,</hi> for his valiantneſs
in the Battel at <hi>Alicarnaſſon,</hi> where he chiefly did
reſtore again the fight, when the young Souldiers
had given it over. The ſecond place of honour
was given to <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and <hi>Philotas Ang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

the third; the fourth was adjudged to <hi>Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,</hi>
the fifth to <hi>Antigonus; Amintas</hi> the Son of <hi>Lyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſters</hi>
obtained the ſixth, <hi>Theodorus</hi> the ſeventh,
and <hi>Hellanicus</hi> the laſt. He alſo profitably altered
many things that were uſed by his Predeceſſours
in the diſcipline of War: For whereas before the
Horſemen of every Country were in ſeveral Bands
by themſelves, he without reſpect of any Nation,
appointed them ſuch Captains as he thought expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.
And whereas at the removing of the Camp,
warning was wont to be given by a Trumpet, the
ſound whereof in any noiſe or tumult could not be
ſufficiently heard, he cauſed an high Pole to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſet up before his Pavilion, on the top whereof
an Enſigne was faſtened, apparent to all men: the
other tokens which they obſerved, were fire in the
night, and ſmoak in the day.</p>
            <p>As he was marching towards <hi>Suſa, Abulites</hi>
that was Ruler of that Region, either by <hi>Darius</hi>
commandment, thinking by means of the ſpoil
either to divert <hi>Alexander,</hi> or by his own free will,
ſent his Son to meet him, proffering the delivery of
the City. The young man was intreated very
gently, and by his conduct <hi>Alexander</hi> paſſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
till he came to the River <hi>Hydaſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is eſteemed to be a very delicate water. <hi>Abulites</hi>
there met <hi>Alexander</hi> with many and Princely gifts,
and preſented him among other things, Drome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries
that were wonderfully ſwift, and with
twelve Elephants that <hi>Darius</hi> had ſent for out of
<hi>India,</hi> to be a terrour to the <hi>Macedons,</hi> which
now were become an increaſe of their ſtrength.
When the riches of the Conquered was come into
the hands of the Conquerour, he found in that
City an incredible Treaſure, fifty thouſand Talents
of maſſie ſilver uncoyned: which Riches gathered
together in the ſpace of many years by divers
Kings, for their ſucceſſion and poſterity, came
thus in a moment into the hands of a forreign
Prince.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> being lodged within the Palace, did

one of the Eunuches that belonged to <hi>Darius</hi>
looked heavily, and fetched a deep ſigh; whoſe
ſadneſs when <hi>Alexander</hi> perceived, he enquired of
him the cauſe: He anſwered, that when he beheld

               <hi>Alexander</hi> purpoſing from thence to paſs into

And for as much as <hi>Alexander</hi> had at the ſame time

whence they ſent unto <hi>Alexander</hi> thirty Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
to ask mercy. But he returned a ſad anſwer
to them, that there was no pardon to be obtained
at his hands: whereupon they being in the utmoſt
danger of death, and excluded from all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
ſent unto <hi>Siſigambis,</hi> by a privy way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to their Enemies, making their requeſt that
ſhe ſhould vouchſafe to be a means to <hi>Alexander</hi> for
the pacifying of his rigour towards them. In her
only they put their hope, knowing how much
<hi>Alexander</hi> loved her, and that he eſteemed her as
if ſhe had been his mother. And they thought ſhe
would the rather incline to their deſire, becauſe
<hi>Madates</hi> that was Captain there had married her
ſiſters Daughter, whereby he became a Kinſman to
<hi>Darius. Siſigambis</hi> ſtood long in denial of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
ſhewing that it agreed not with her fortune
to become an interceſſour for others; adding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
that ſhe feared leſt ſhe might miſuſe his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
and make him weary of her importunities;
for ſhe ſaid, that ſhe had more remembrance that ſhe
was a priſoner, then that ſhe was a Queen. But at
length ſhe was overcome with their ſolicitations,
and by her Letters made interceſſion unto <hi>Alexander,</hi>
after ſuch ſort, that ſhe firſt excuſed her ſelf of her
ſute making, and after required him that he would
pardon them, or at the leaſtwiſe that he would
forgive her, being Petitioner only for the life of
ſuch a one as was her Friend and Kinſman; and
now no longer an enemy, but in readineſs to ſubmit
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:46658:95"/>
himſelf. This one thing is ſufficient to declare the
moderation and clemency that was then in <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi>
for he did not only pardon <hi>Madates,</hi> but alſo
left the City untouched, granting to all that were
within it their liberty, with enjoyment of their
Lands and Goods, without paying of any tribute.
More then this ſhe could not have obtained of <hi>Darius</hi>
being her Son.</p>
            <p>When he had thus ſubdued the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xians,</hi> he uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them to the Province of <hi>Suſa,</hi> and purpoſing
to paſs forwards, he divided his Army into two
parts; whereof he committed the one to <hi>Parmenio</hi>
to be conducted through the plain Country, and
reſerving ſuch a part as was peſtered leaſt with
baggage, he took the way of the Mountains, which
with a continual ridge runneth out in length from
thence into <hi>Perſia.</hi> In his paſſage he plundered all
the Mountain-Country, and arrived the third
day in the confines of <hi>Perſia.</hi> The fifth day he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the Streights of <hi>Pylae Suſiae,</hi> which were
defended by <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> with fifteen thouſand
Footmen, who on the tops of the high and ſteep
Rocks that hung over on both ſides the way, at the
firſt kept themſelves quiet on purpoſe, pretending
a fear, until ſuch time as the Army was entred into
the narroweſt of the Streights. But when they
ſaw the <hi>Macedons</hi> paſs on forwards in contempt of
them, then they threw down great ſtones upon
them; which falling upon the undermoſt Rocks,
and there breaking in pieces, rebounded amongſt
the <hi>Macedons,</hi> falling with ſuch violence, that
they diſtreſſed whole Regiments at once. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this, they did them great damage with ſhot
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:46658:95"/>
of Arrows and Stones that they caſted out of Slings.
Such as were men of courage were not ſo much
grieved with the death and deſtruction that they
ſaw there preſent, as that they ſhould be ſlain af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſuch a manner, like beaſts caught in a pit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they could not be revenged upon their Enemies.
Their wrath hereupon was turned into ſuch a rage,
that they ran up againſt the Rocks, and there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
themſelves by taking hold and by heaving
up of one another, to mount up unto their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
But when they had caught hold of ſome
outward part, and thereby laboured to aſcend (by
force of ſo many hands that faſtened to it at once)
they pulled in ſunder the thing they held by, and
fell down all together. In this caſe they could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
remain, go forwards, nor yet defend themſelves
by any device they could make with their Targets,
ſeeing the ſtones were of ſuch weight that were
thrown down upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> was in great trouble of minde, not
only for the grief he received by the deſtruction
of his men, but much more for the ſhame that he
had ſo raſhly brought his men into ſuch a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
ſtraight. He had been invincible before that
day, and never attempted any thing in vain: He
had paſſed the Streights of <hi>Cilicia</hi> without damage,
and opened to himſelf a new way by Sea into <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philia;</hi>
which felicity of his ſeemed to be now at
a ſtay, if not to retreat; for he could perceive no
other remedy, then to return by the way he came.
He cauſed the retreat therefore to be ſounded, and
gave order to his Souldiers to go cloſe together, and
by caſting their Targets over their heads, to return
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:46658:96"/>
the ſame way they came, having then marched thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Furlongs within the Straight.</p>
            <p>When he returned, and had planted his Camp
in an open ground, conſulting what was beſt to
do, ſuch a ſuperſtition invaded his minde, that
he called for the Prieſts and Diviners to help the
matter by their invocation: But <hi>Ariſtander,</hi> to whom
he gave moſt confidence, could do nothing in that
caſe. <hi>Alexander</hi> therefore condemning their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
which he thought then done out of time,
called for ſuch as knew the Countrey: they ſhewed
him of another way that was plain and open e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
but yet he liked it not, he was ſo aſhamed
to leave his Souldiers unburied that were ſlain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For
amongſt all other Ceremonies obſerved in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
of their Wars, there was not any more
religiouſly kept, then the burying of the dead. He
cauſed therefore ſuch priſoners as were lately taken
to be called before him; amongſt whom, there was
one expert both of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> tongue,
who ſhewed to the King that he laboured in vain, if
he thought to convey his Army over the tops of thoſe
Mountains; which (he ſaid) began at Mount <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſus,</hi>
and cloſed in the one ſide of <hi>Perſia,</hi> by the
ſpace of ſixteen hundred Furlongs in length, and
one hundred and forty in bredth, till ſuch time as
they deſcended unto the Sea, which maketh ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Fence where the Mountains ceaſed. The
Country lying at the foot of the Mountains, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
to be plain, fruitful, and repleniſhed with
many fair Cities and Villages, and that the River
of <hi>Araxes</hi> running through the ſame, falleth into
another River called <hi>Medus,</hi> bringing with it the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:46658:96"/>
Tributes of many ſmaller ſtreams; which River of
<hi>Medus</hi> being much leſs then the ſame which it doth
receive, runneth from thence towards the South.
No place could be more abundant of graſs, the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
every where cloathing with Flowers, what it
had bedewed with its waters. The River was ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
over with Plantain and Poplar-trees, which
by reaſon they ſtand ſomewhat high, and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
runneth low in a deep channel, ſeem to ſuch
as be afar off, to be woods adjoyning to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
He accounted no Country in <hi>Aſia</hi> to be more
wholeſome, or to have a more temperate air then
this, both by reaſon of ſhadowy Mountains that
evermore keep off the heat; and alſo of the Sea,
which on that part being at hand, with a conſtant
temperature doth nouriſh the ground.</p>
            <p>When the priſoner had made a deſcription of
the Country after this manner, the King enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of him whether he knew thoſe things by report,
or elſe had ſeen them with his eyes. He ſaid that
he had been a Herds-man, and knew the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
very well, and all the paſſages, and that he
had been twice taken priſoner; once by the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi>
in <hi>Lycia,</hi> and now the ſecond time by him.
Upon theſe words <hi>Alexander</hi> called an Oracle to
memory, whereby it was ſignified to him, that a
<hi>Lycian</hi> ſhould be his Guide into <hi>Perſia.</hi> Wherefore
promiſing to him ſuch rewards as the preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
required, and as his eſtate was meet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive;
he willed him to be armed after the <hi>Macedons</hi>
manner, and to be their Guide to ſhew them the
way; which way, though he had declared to be
ſtreight and difficult, yet <hi>Alexander</hi> made no
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:46658:97"/>
doubt to paſs it with a ſmall number, thinking it
no difficult matter to paſs that place for his glory,
which the Herds-men had paſſed often-times for
the profit of paſture. Then the guide left not to
alledge the difficulties of the way, ſpecially for
ſuch as wear arms: but the King ſaid to him, Take
me for ſurety, that not one of them that are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
thee, ſhall refuſe to go where thou ſhalt
paſs.</p>
            <p>That done, he left <hi>Craterus</hi> with the charge of his
Camp, and he himſelf paſſed forwards with ſuch
Footmen as were accuſtomed to his perſon, with
thoſe bands of whom <hi>Meleager</hi> had charge, and
with a thouſand Archers on horſeback, taking firſt
order with <hi>Craterus</hi> that he ſhould keep his Camp
in the ſame form it had been uſed before, and cauſe
many fires to be made of purpoſe, that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
might rather think him to be there ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:
he adviſed him further, that if he perceived
<hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> to get knowledge of his Enterprize,
and ſo to ſend part of his power to the ſtopping of
his paſſage, that then by pretending of an aſſault,
he ſhould ſhew all the terrour he could to draw his
Enemies from him, to the defence of that place.
But if that he himſelf ſhould deceive his Enemies,
and recover the Hill upon them, that then upon
the hearing of the alarm in the Camp of the
<hi>Perſians,</hi> preparing themſelves to reſiſt him, he
ſhould not doubt to paſs that way from whence
they were repulſed the day before, judging they
ſhould finde no reſiſtance, the Enemies power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
converted towards him. In the third watch
he ſet forwards in great ſilence, without ſounding
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:46658:97"/>
of Trumpet, and paſſed on by ſuch a way as was
ſhewed him by the Guide; every Souldier that was
light armed carrying three days Victuals. But
when he was on his way, beſides the wilde Rocks
and ſharp ſtones that cauſed them oft to fail their
footing, the Snow driven by the winde was a great
impediment to them in their journey, for they
fell divers times down into pits; and ſuch as cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to pull them out, were often-times themſelves
drawn after. The night alſo, with the Country
unknown, and the Guide, of whoſe fidelity they
doubted, increaſed much their fear, conſidering
that if they ſhould not deceive their Enemies watch,
they ſhould be taken and periſh like beaſts. They
conſidered alſo, that both their ſafeguard and the
Kings lay in the hands of a priſoner.</p>
            <p>At length they came to a Mountain, where the
way towards <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> lay on the right hand,
where he ſent before, under the guiding of ſuch
as they had taken priſoners, <hi>Philotas, Cenon, Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,</hi>
and <hi>Polipercon,</hi> with a band of the lighteſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
whom he adviſed, that foraſmuch as they
had both horſemen and footmen, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
fertile and abundant in forrage, that they
ſhould make no haſte, but paſs forwards fair and
eaſily; and he, with the Eſquires of his body; and
the band of horſemen whom they called <hi>Agema,</hi>
was guided by another by-path, far off from the
place where his enemies kept their watch: But the
paſſage was ſo ſtraight and ſo hollow, that they
ſuffered great trouble and vexation in paſſing
thereof. It was now mid-day, and they were ſo
wearied, that of neceſſity they muſt take reſt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:46658:98"/>
ſo far to go, as they had travelled already,
ſaving that the way was not altogether ſo difficult
and rough. He refreſhed therefore his men with
meat and ſleep, and in the ſecond Watch did riſe
up, and paſſed the reſt of his journey without any
great difficulty, ſaving in that part where the
Mountain began to fall aſlope towards the plain;
their paſſage was there ſuddenly ſtopped by a great
gull, occaſioned by the violence of the ſtreams
that ran down the Mountains, by wearing away
the Earth; and beſides, the trees ſtanding ſo thick,
and the boughs that grew one within another, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
before them as a continual hedge. When
they ſaw themſelves ſtayed after this manner, ſuch
deſperation fell amongſt them, that they could
ſcarcely abſtain from tears, the darkneſs being a
great increaſe of their terrour, ſeeing they could
not enjoy any benefit of the Stars; for if any gave
light, the ſame was taken away by the ſhadow of
the trees. And the uſe of the ear could not ſerve
for one to receive counſel and comfort from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the winde whirling amongſt the leaves, and
the ſhaking of the boughs making an amazing
noiſe. But at length the day increaſing in its light,
diminiſhed the terrours that the darkneſs of the
night had made. Then by fetching a little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
about, they paſſed the hollow gull, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man began to be a guide to himſelf. At laſt
they got up on the top of the Hill, from whence
they might behold their Enemies in their Camp.
Then the <hi>Macedons</hi> ſhewed themſelves ſtoutly in
their Armour, appearing ſuddenly on their backs,
when they miſtruſted no ſuch thing, and there
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:46658:98"/>
ſlew ſuch as came firſt to encounter with them: So
that on the one part, the grievous noiſe of them
that were ſlain, and the miſerable ſhrick of ſuch
as ran in for ſuccour amongſt their own company,
put the reſt to ſlight without making any reſiſtance.
When the Alarm was once heard in the Camp
where <hi>Craterus</hi> lay, the Army by and by paſſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to go through the Streights, in the which they
were repulſed the day before. <hi>Philotas</hi> alſo, with
<hi>Polipercon, Cenos,</hi> and <hi>Amintas,</hi> who were gone
the other way, arrived at the ſame time, and gave
a further terrour unto their Enemies. When the
<hi>Perſians</hi> ſaw their Enemies aſſailing them in all
parts at once, though they were ſo oppreſt with
their ſudden invaſion, that at the firſt they were
in doubt what to do; yet at length they aſſembled
together, and fought notably, neceſſity ſtirring up
the faintneſs of their hearts; for often-times deſpair
is the cauſe of good hope. They being unarmed,
cloſed with them that were armed, and with the
weight of their bodies pulled their Enemies to the
Earth, and killed divers with their own Weapons.
<hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> with forty Horſemen, and five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Footmen that kept about his perſon, brake
through the Battel of the <hi>Macedons,</hi> to the great
ſlaughter of his own men and his Enemies; and by
making haſte, recovered <hi>Perſepolis</hi> the chief City
of the Countrey. But when he was excluded from
thence by ſuch as were within, he renewed again
the Fight with ſuch as were with him, and ſo was
ſlain.</p>
            <p>By that time <hi>Craterus,</hi> that made all the ſpeed he
could, was come unto them, <hi>Alexander</hi> fortified
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:46658:99"/>
his Camp in the ſame place, where he did diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
his Enemies. For though they were all fled,
and he certain of the Victory, yet becauſe he found
his way ſtopped in many places with great and deep
Ditches, he thought good to uſe circumſpection,
and not to make too great a ſpeed: not ſo much
by fear of his Enemies Force, as by reaſon of the
nature of the ground, which he found apt for them
to lay ambuſhments againſt him. As he was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
forwards, he received Letters from <hi>Tyridates</hi> the
keeper of <hi>Darius</hi> Treaſure, ſignifying that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiters
of <hi>Perſepolis</hi> hearing of his coming, were
about to ſpoil the Treaſure; and that therefore he
ſhould haſte to prevent it, for the way was ready
enough, notwithſtanding the River of <hi>Araxes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed.
There was no vertue in <hi>Alexander</hi> more
commendable then his celerity, which he ſhewed
ſpecially in this; for leaving his footmen behinde,
he travelled all night with his horſemen, and by
day-light came to the River of <hi>Araxes;</hi> there he
found many Villages and Houſes, whoſe Timber
being taken down, a Bridge was raiſed in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by the help of ſtones which were found in the
bottom of the River.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When</hi> Alexander <hi>had paſſed the River, and came
near unto the City, a company met him ſo miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as ſeldom have been found in any memory.
They were</hi> Greeks, <hi>to the number of four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,
whom the</hi> Perſians <hi>heretofore had taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
and afflicted with divers kindes of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
For ſome of them had their feet cut off,
ſome their hands, and others their ears, but all were
marked in the fleſh with hot Irons. The</hi> Perſians
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:46658:99"/>
               <hi>having maimed and deformed them after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
kept and reſerved them ſtill, as a memory
of their deſpite towards the Nation. But when
they ſaw they ſhould come under the obedience of
another Prince, they ſuffered the</hi> Greeks <hi>to meet</hi>
Alexander. <hi>They ſeemed rather to be Specters
then men: for nothing could be diſcerned or known
but their voice. The compaſſion of their wretched
eſtate, cauſed the beholders to let fall no fewer
tears then they did themſelves. For it could not
appear which of them were moſt miſerable, though
their afflictions were divers. But when they had
cried out before</hi> Alexander, <hi>that</hi> Jupiter <hi>the reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of</hi> Greece <hi>had opened their eyes in beholding
him that ſhould deliver them, they judged then
all their gifts as one.</hi> Alexander <hi>wiped the tears
from his eyes, and willed them to be of good chear;
for that they ſhould both ſee their Countrey and
their Friends: and he encamped at the ſame place
where he met them, being two furlongs from</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſepolis.
<hi>The</hi> Greeks <hi>drew themſelves together to
conſult what was beſt for them to demand of</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander;
<hi>and when ſome were of opinion to ask
dwelling places within</hi> Aſia, <hi>and others had more
minde to return into their Countries,</hi> Euctemon <hi>the</hi>
Cymaean <hi>ſpake thus unto them:</hi> We that even
now were aſhamed to put our heads out of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and darkneſs we were in, to make ſuit for our
own aid and relief, are become of ſuch ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that we preſently deſire to ſhew unto <hi>Greece</hi> as
a pleaſant ſpectacle, our deformities and maims,
whereof we have as much cauſe to be aſhamed, as
to be grieved. You muſt think that ſuch bear their
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:46658:100"/>
miſeries beſt, who can finde the means to hide
them moſt; and that there is no Countrey ſo fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to men that be unfortunate, as ſolitarineſs, and
forgetfulneſs of their former eſtate. For they
which make an account of their Friends pity and
compaſſion, know not how ſoon their tears may
dry up: no Creatures can love thoſe faithfully
whom they abhor. For as calamity of her own
Nature is full of complaint; ſo Felicity is always
proud, and every one doth uſe to think of his
own Fortune, when he judgeth of his Neighbours:
For except we had all been in miſery, one of us
long ago had been weary of another. What mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
is it then, though men in felicity ſeek alwaies
their equals? My opinion is therefore, that we
(who as men long ago were as dead in this life) ſeek
us a place wherein we may hide our maimed mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and whereas exile may conceal our horrible
deformities. If we ſhall return into our Countrey,
being in this caſe, how can we but be unwelcome
to our Wives whom we married young? Or ſhall
our Children or our Brethren now acknowledge us,
being the vomits of ſo many Priſons? and though
all things ſhould there ſucceed as we could wiſh,
yet how ſmall a number of us are able to travel
through ſo many Countries? How is it poſſible for
us that are here baniſhed into the uttermoſt bounds
of the Orient, being aged, impotent, and maimed, to
endure thoſe travels which have wearied men who
have been both armed, and Conquerours? It is to
be asked, what ſhall become of our Wives whom
Chance and Neceſſity hath here procured us, for the
only comfort of our impriſonment? what ſhall we
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:46658:100"/>
do with our Children? Shall we take them with us,
or leave them behinde us? If we return with ſuch as
we have here, none of thoſe in <hi>Greece</hi> will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
us; and ſhall we then be ſo mad to leave thoſe
comforts we have already, being uncertain whether we
ſhall arrive at thoſe which we deſire, or not? Verily
much better it were for us, to conceal our ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them who have been acquainted with us in our
miſery.</p>
            <p>Theſe were <hi>Euctemon</hi> his words: but <hi>Theatus,</hi>
the <hi>Athenian,</hi> reaſoned to the contrary.</p>
            <p>There is no wiſe man (<hi>quoth he</hi>) that will eſteem
us by our outward ſhape, ſeeing that our calamity
is not come by Nature, but by the cruelty of our
Enemies: Such as are aſhamed of the injuries of
Fortune, are well worthy to ſuffer miſadventures:
They give a grievous ſentence upon the ſtate of
mans Mortality, and deſpair much of mercy, who
deny their compaſſion to men in miſery. Now
therefore, ſince the gods have offered to you what
ye durſt never have wiſhed for, that is, your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
your Wives, and your Childre, being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
things which men eſteem more then life, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
oftentimes with death; Why do you doubt
for the enjoyment of thoſe things, to break out of
this impriſonment? I judge the Air of our own
Country moſt natural to us, where there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manner of living, other Cuſtoms, other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and another tongue; which for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs
of it, is coveted of the Barbarous Nations.
What great things then be thoſe which ye would
willingly leave, the want of which onely is the
cauſe of your miſery? My Opinion is plain, that
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:46658:101"/>
we viſit our Countrey and our Home, and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
ſo great a benefit as <hi>Alexander</hi> hath proffered us.
If any be detained with the love of ſuch wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
as they have gotten here in ſervitude, let ſuch be
no impediment to others, that eſteem moſt their natural
Countrey.</p>
            <p>There were but few of this opinion; for cuſtome,
that is of greater force then nature, prevailed in
that point. They agreed therefore to demand of
<hi>Alexander</hi> the gift of ſome place to inhabit in, and
choſe out a hundred to be Petitioners to him in that
behalf. When <hi>Alexander</hi> perceived them coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, thinking that they would have required
what he had conceived, he ſaid unto them:</p>
            <p>I have appointed to every one of you Beaſts to carry
you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a thouſand Deniers; and when you ſhall
come to <hi>Greece,</hi> I will ſo well provide for you, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
your misfortune, no man ſhall think himſelf in
better caſe then you.</p>
            <p>But when he ſaw them looking ſtill toward the
ground, and that they neither lifted up their eyes,
nor ſpake one word, he enquired the cauſe of their
heavineſs. Then <hi>Euctemon</hi> rehearſed again thoſe
words in effect, which he had ſpoken before in
Councel. The King therefore pitying no leſs
their demand, then he did their misfortune, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
three thouſand Deniers to be given to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of them, and ten ſuits of apparel, with Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
and Corn, whereby they might Till and Sow the
Land that ſhould be appointed to them. The next
day he aſſembled all the Captains of his Army to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and repreſented to them, that there was no

War againſt <hi>Europe,</hi> with the deſtruction of which
City he thought good to revenge the blood of their
Predeceſſours. The Inhabitants had abandoned
that City, and fled where their fear did drive
them. Whereupon, the King ſtraightways brought
in all the <hi>Phalanx</hi> to the ſpoil thereof. He had
before that time won many Cities; ſome by force,
and ſome by compoſition, that were full of riches,
and of Princes Treaſure; but the abundance of that
City did exceed all the reſt, as being the place
where the <hi>Perſians</hi> had laid up all their ſubſtance:
Gold and Silver was found in heaps, and great
plenty of rich habiliments and furniture of houſes,
not only for neceſſary uſe, but for exceſs and oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
which was ſo great, that it gave the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours
occaſion to fight for it amongſt themſelves,
each taking other for their enemies that had gotten
the richeſt ſpoil. The abundance there was ſuch,
that they could not imploy the riches which they
found; but when they ſaw things of value, they
eſteemed them rather, then took them away. At
laſt, every one of them coveting to have a part of
every thing, did tear and break aſunder the Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Robes, and the precious Plate of curious work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip,
with the Images of Gold and Silver,
which were plucked in pieces, as every one caught
hold; nothing was left untouched, nor any thing
carried away whole: cruelty bearing no leſs rule
then covetouſneſs, every one was ſo laden with
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:46658:102"/>
gold and ſilver, that they eſteemed not the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their priſoners, but killed ſuch as at firſt
they ſpared in hope of gain. There were many
therefore that prevented their Enemies by a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
death; and divers cloathing themſelves in
their moſt precious apparel, leaped down from the
walls with their wives and children. Certain there
were that ſet their own houſes on fire, (which they
judged their Enemies would elſe have done) and
burned themſelves with their Family together. At
length, the King did forbid any violence to be done
to women, and that no man ſhould meddle with
any thing pertaining to them. The ſum of money
taken within this City, was greater then any man
can well credit; but either we muſt doubt with
others, or elſe believe what hath been left in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
that the Treaſure there found, amounted to a
hundred and twenty thouſand Talents: which
Treaſure, becauſe <hi>Alexander</hi> would employ in his
Wars, he cauſed Horſes and Camels to be brought
from <hi>Suſae</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> to convey the ſame. The
taking of the City of <hi>Perſagadis,</hi> wherein were
found ſix thouſand Talents, was an increaſe to
this ſum; which City being built by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> was
yielded up by <hi>Gobates,</hi> who had the Government
thereof.</p>

               </gap>is
Enterprize, to the place appointed. In his march
he came unto a Country that was covered with
Snow, and frozen by the violence of the great
cold. The melancholy of the Wilderneſs put the
Souldiers that were wearied with travel in ſuch a
terrour, that they imagined they had ſeen the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt
bounds of the world: For when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
all things waſte, and no ſigne appearing of
the habitation of men, they were amazed, and
made requeſt to return again, before that the Light
and Elements ſhould fail them. The King would
not chaſtiſe them, being in this terrour, but leaped
from his Horſe, and marched on foot before them
in the Snow and the Ice: Which thing when his
Friends ſaw, they could not for ſhame but follow;
then the Captains did the like, and finally the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers:
The King was the firſt that made himſelf a
way, by breaking the Ice with a Pick-Axe; whoſe
example the reſt did follow. At length, having
paſſed the deſolate Woods, they found here and
there ſome appearance of habitation, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
Flocks of Sheep: When the Inhabitants, who
dwelled in the Cottages diſperſed thereabouts, ſaw
armed men advancing, whom they judged to be
their Enemies, thinking they had been incloſed
about, they ſlew ſuch as were not able to follow
them, and fled themſelves to the Mountains that
were full of Snow. But at length, by communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:46658:103"/>
with ſuch as they took priſoners, their wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
was ſomewhat mitigated, and they yielded
themſelves to <hi>Alexander,</hi> who did them no hurt
at all. When he had conquered all that part of
<hi>Perſia,</hi> and brought the Towns under his obedience,
he came into the Countrey of the warlike <hi>Mardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
who did differ much from the reſt of the
other <hi>Perſians</hi> in their manner of living: They
with their wives and children did dig themſelves
Caves in the Mountains, and lived with the fleſh of
ſheep and wilde Beaſts: nor had the women any
appearance or diſpoſition more ſoft or milde then
the men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their ſhagged hair hung down before
upon their faces, and their garments came but to
their knees; the bands of their Slings were fillets for
their fore-heads, which they uſed both for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and defence. This Nation, for all their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civility
could not eſcape from being ſubdued with
the ſame force of fortune that others were; ſo that
on the thirtieth day after he departed from <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi>
he returned to it again. Then he gave re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to his friends, and to all the reſt according
to their deſervings, diſtributing in a manner all
the riches which he found within that City. But
all the excellent vertues of his minde, his Princely
qualities, wherein he excelled all Kings, that
conſtancy in all dangers, that dexterity in contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and performing all Enterprizes, the keeping
of his promiſe with thoſe that ſubmitted, his cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
towards priſoners, and that temperance in
lawful and accuſtomary pleaſures, were all defaced
through the intolerable deſire and delight he had
in drinking. For notwithſtanding that his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:46658:103"/>
my which contended with him for the Empire, did
make then great Levies for the Wars, and was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
his power together; and although the
people newly conquered were not yet in a quiet
ſubjection, yet he gave himſelf continually to
feaſting and banquetting, where women were ever
preſent; not ſuch to whom men had reſpect for
honeſty, but Harlots, who had in the Camp more
liberty, then beſeemed the diſcipline of men of
War.</p>
            <p>Amongſt them there was one <hi>Thais,</hi> who upon
a day in her drunkenneſs, affirmed to <hi>Alexander,</hi>
that he ſhould wonderfully win the favour of the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> if he would command the Palace of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſepolis</hi>
to be ſet on fire; the deſtruction whereof (ſhe
ſaid) they greatly deſired; for ſo much as the ſame
was the Seat of the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> which in times
paſt had deſtroyed ſo many of their Cities. When the
drunken Harlot had given her Sentence, a ſecond
and a third (they being likewiſe drunk) confirmed
her words. <hi>Alexander,</hi> who then had in him more
inclination to heat then patience, ſaid, <hi>Why do we
not then revenge</hi> Greece, <hi>and ſet this City on fire?</hi>
They were all high with Wine, and roſe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
upon thoſe words to burn that City in their
drunkenneſs, which the men of War had ſpared in
their fury. The King himſelf firſt, and after him
his Gueſts, his Servants, and his Concubines ſet fire
on the Palace; which being builded for the moſt
part of Cedar, became ſuddenly on a flame.
When the Army that was encamped near unto the
City beheld the fire, which they thought had been
kindled by ſome caſualty, they came running to
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:46658:104"/>
quench the ſame: But when they ſaw the King
there preſent nouriſhing the flame, they poured
out the water which they brought, and helped like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to increaſe the fire.</p>
            <p>Thus the Palace that was the Head of the whole
Orient, from whence ſo many Nations before had
fetched their Laws to live under; the Seat of ſo
many Kings, the only Terrour ſometimes of
<hi>Greece,</hi> that had ſet forth a Navy of ten thouſand
Ships, and Armies that overflowed all <hi>Europe,</hi> who
made Bridges over the Sea, and undermined Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
where the Sea hath now his courſe, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,
and had his end, and never roſe again in all
the Ages that did enſue; for the Kings of <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
made choice of other Cities, which are now
in the hands of the <hi>Parthians.</hi> The deſtruction of
this City was ſuch, that the Foundation thereof, at
this day, cannot be found, but that the river of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raxes</hi>
doth ſhew where it ſtood, which was diſtant
from <hi>Perſepolis</hi> twenty furlongs, as the Inhabitants
rather do believe then know. The <hi>Macedons</hi> were
aſhamed that ſo Noble a City was deſtroyed by their
King in his drunkenneſs: yet at length it was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into a work that carried gravity in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance;
and they were content to think it expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
that the City ſhould have been ſo deſtroyed.
But it is certain, that when <hi>Alexander</hi> had taken
his reſt, and was better adviſed, he repented him
of this deed, and ſaid, <hi>That the</hi> Perſians <hi>ſhould
have done the</hi> Greeks <hi>more harm, if it had been his
chance to have Reigned in</hi> Xerxes <hi>ſtead.</hi> The next
day he gave thirty Talents for a reward to him
that was his Guide into <hi>Perſia;</hi> and from thence he
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:46658:104"/>
advanced forwards into <hi>Media,</hi> where a new ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of Souldiers (of whom <hi>Plato</hi> of <hi>Athens</hi> had the
Conduct) came to him out of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> being five
hundred Footmen, and a thouſand Horſemen.</p>
            <p>When he had by this means increaſed his power,
he determined to purſue <hi>Darius,</hi> who was come to
<hi>Ecbatana,</hi> the Head City of <hi>Media,</hi> and was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
from thence to have paſſed into <hi>Bactria:</hi> But
fearing to be prevented by the ſpeed which his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
made, he altered his purpoſe, and his journey.
<hi>Alexander</hi> was not come near by fifty hundred fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs;
but he could not think any diſtance ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to defend him againſt his celerity; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
prepared himſelf rather to fight, then to fly:
He had with him thirty thouſand Footmen, amongſt
whom there was four thouſand <hi>Greeks,</hi> whoſe Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
never failed in all his adverſe Fortune: He
had alſo four thouſand Archers and Slingers, beſides
thirty three hundred <hi>Bactrian</hi> Horſemen, which
were under <hi>Beſſus</hi> charge, being Governour both
of the City of <hi>Bactria,</hi> and the Country. <hi>Darius,</hi>
with thoſe Forces, withdrew a little from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and commanded ſuch as had charge of the
Carriage to paſs on before: He called a Councel,
where he ſpake to this effect:</p>
            <p>If Fortune had matched me with Cowards, and
with ſuch as preferred a vile life before an honeſt
death, I would rather have held my peace, then at
this inſtant conſume words in vain; But I have
had greater experience then I could wiſh, both of
your valour and fidelity towards me: So that I for
my part, ought rather to ſeem worthy to have ſuch
Friends as you are, then to doubt whether ye yet
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:46658:105"/>
remain the ſame men towards me ye were before;
For of ſo many thouſands that were under my Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
you only have followed and adhered to me:
Though I have been twice overthrown in the Field,
and twice inforced to fly away, your fidelity and
your conſtancy doth make me think that I remain
ſtill a King. Traytors and Fugitives do reign in my
Cities; not for that they be thought worthy of
ſuch honour, but that you might be provoked by
their rewards to revolt againſt me. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
you have choſen rather to follow me in my
misfortune, then be partakers of the felicity of the
Conquerours. You are worthy, whom the Gods
ſhall reward if I may not, as undoubtedly they
will. There can no Poſterity be ſo ſilent, nor
Fame ſo ungrateful, which ſhall not with due com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
extol you to the Stars. Though I had
within me thoughts of Flight, whereunto my heart
never agreed; yet I have now conceived ſuch a
truſt of your Vertue and Manhood, that I purpoſe
to advance againſt my Enemy: How long ſhall I
be as a baniſhed man within mine own Dominion,
and flie from a ſtrange and Forreign Prince within
the bounds of mine own Kingdom? When may
I by hazarding the Battel, either recover what I
have loſt, or elſe die an honourable death? Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
peradventure it ſeemeth better to ſome men,
that I ſhould ſubmit my ſelf to my enemies will,
and by the Example of <hi>Mazeus</hi> and <hi>Mithrenes,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
by Petition the Dominion of ſome one Nation;
wherein I judge that <hi>Alexander</hi> had rather follow
the inclination of his glory, then of his wrath.
No, let the gods never grant, that it may lie in a
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:46658:105"/>
mans power, either to take away, or give unto me
this Diadem upon my head; nor that I loſe this
Empire, ſo long as I have breath. For in this I am
reſolved, that my Life and my Kingdom ſhall end
both together. If this minde, if this reſolution
remain in you, there is none of you that can want
liberty, there is none that ſhall be compelled to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the arrogancy of your Enemies. Every mans
right hand ſhall give unto himſelf either a revenge,
or an end of his evils. I my ſelf am an Example
of Fortune; and therefore it is not without cauſe
that I look for a better change. And if the worſt
fall out, that the gods do continue againſt us in
our Wars that be lawfull and honeſt; yet this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denied, but that we may manfully and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
die. I require and conjure you, by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of our Predeceſſours, who with ſuch Fame
and Glory have poſſeſſed the Kingdomes of the
whole Orient; by thoſe men to whom <hi>Macedon</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
was tributary, by ſo many Navies of Ships
ſent into <hi>Greece,</hi> and by ſo many Victories won,
that ye will take ſuch courage unto you, as may
ſeem worthy your Nobility and your Nation; and
that with the ſame conſtancy of minde wherewith you
have endured things paſt, you attempt whatſoever
Fortune ſhall produce hereafter. I am reſolved for
my part, to purchaſe to my ſelf a perpetual Fame,
either by Victory, or by ſome notable Adventure in the
Fight.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Darius</hi> had ſpoken theſe words, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
of the preſent peril ſo amazed them
all, that they were not able either to ſhew their
advice, or to ſpeak a word, until ſuch time as
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:46658:106"/>
               <hi>Artabaſus,</hi> the moſt ancient of his Friends (who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-time
had been with King <hi>Philip</hi>) began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
his reſolution:</p>
            <p>We are come into the Field (<hi>quoth he</hi>) with you
that are our King, in our moſt precious Apparel, and
richeſt Armour, with intent to win the Victory; and
we do neither deſpair of Victory, nor do we refuſe to
die.</p>
            <p>To thoſe words all the reſt with one voice ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to agree, ſaving <hi>Nabarzanes,</hi> who being preſent
in that Councel with <hi>Beſſus,</hi> and of his Opinion,
conſpired a Treaſon ſo prodigious; that the like
hath ſeldom been heard of: Their determination
was, by force of the Souldiers they had under their
charge, to put their King in hold; with this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
that if <hi>Alexander</hi> purſued them, to deliver
him then alive into his hands, to win thereby his
favour, as a thing which they thought he would
greatly eſteem: But if they could eſcape convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
then they were in minde to kill <hi>Darius,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
the Kingdom betwixt them, renew again
the War againſt the <hi>Macedons.</hi> They having ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
this Treaſon long before in their mindes, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barzanes</hi>
thought this an occaſion to make a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
to his wicked intent, by this perſwaſion which
he uttered:</p>
            <p>I am confident (<hi>quoth he</hi>) that I ſhall ſpeak what
at the firſt appearance ſhall not be grateful unto
your ears: But Phyſitians uſe to cure Diſeaſes that
be great, with ſharp and bitter Medicines: And
the Ship-Maſters, when they fear a Ship-wrack, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtome
to redeem ſuch things as may be ſaved,
with the deſtruction and loſs of the reſt: Yet this
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:46658:106"/>
what I ſhall perſwade unto is not to your detriment,
but an Expedient by what means you may preſerve
your ſelf and your Kingdom. We make a War where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the gods ſeem manifeſtly to be againſt us, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
ceaſeth not obſtinately to purſue us: It is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
therefore that we lay new Foundations, and ſeek
out men who have other Fortunes: My Opinion is, that
you deliver up your Kingdom unto ſome mans hands
who ſhall have the Name of King, ſo long as your
Enemies are within <hi>Aſia:</hi> And when they be once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
(which my minde giveth me to be ſhortly) he
ſhall reſtore unto you the ſame again: The Country of
<hi>Bactria</hi> is yet untouched; the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Sacans</hi> be
at your appointment: ſo many People, ſo many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
ſo many thouſands of Horſemen and Footmen
have their Forces in readineſs to renew this War:
So that a much greater Force remaineth, then that
which the War hath conſumed. Why do we then like
Beaſts, wilfully run to a deſtruction that is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary?
It is the property of ſuch as are men of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
rather to deſpiſe death, then to hate life; and
oftentimes, by wearineſs of travel, Cowards are
driven to take little regard of themſelves; but Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
leaving nothing unproved, and Death being the
end of all things, it is ſufficient if we go not to it
like Sluggards: Therefore if we ſhall go unto <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctria,</hi>
which is now our next Refuge, let us, for the
preſent, make <hi>Beſſus</hi> our King, who is already Ruler
of that Country; and when the Affairs be once brought
to ſome ſtay, he ſhall reſtore to you the Empire again,
as to their Right King.</p>
            <p>Although <hi>Darius</hi> perceived not the greatneſs
of the miſchief that lay hidden under his wicked
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:46658:107"/>
words, yet it was no marvel that he could not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain;
for he turned towards him, and ſaid, <hi>Thou
vile Slave, haſt thou now found out a time meet to
diſcloſe the Treaſon that lyeth in thy heart?</hi> And
therewithal he pulled out his Sword to have ſlain
him, if <hi>Beſſus,</hi> and the other <hi>Bactrians</hi> about him,
had not hindred his purpoſe. Theſe pretended to
be ſorry for the matter, but minded in very deed
to binde him, if he had continued in his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>In the mean ſeaſon, <hi>Nabarzanes</hi> eſcaped away,
and <hi>Beſſus</hi> followed after; who immediately did ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
the Bands they had charge of from the reſt
of the Army, becauſe they would uſe them apart
to their own purpoſe. When they were departed,
<hi>Artabaſus</hi> framed his talk according to the eſtate
of the time then preſent, and began to pacifie <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
with words; putting him in remembrance,
how his caſe was ſuch, that it behoved him to bear
quietly the fooliſhneſs, or rather the errour of his
own men, for as much as <hi>Alexander</hi> was at hand,
too ſore an Enemy for them, although there were
no diſobedience: But if we ſhall be at variance
(quoth he) when he does purſue us, our affairs ſhall
ſtand in very evil condition. Thereupon <hi>Darius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
ſomewhat to <hi>Artabaſus</hi> advice; and though
he was minded to remove, yet becauſe he perceived
every man to be troubled in minde, he remained
ſtill in the ſame place. But he himſelf was ſo aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with ſorrow and deſperation, that he kept
himſelf cloſe, and came not forth of his Pavilion:
Whereupon the Camp being without Government,
the Heads not conſulting together as they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:46658:107"/>
there aroſe amongſt them a great diverſity of
Opinions, and motions of minde: Which thing
when <hi>Patron</hi> ſaw, that was Captain of the <hi>Greek</hi>
Souldiers, he willed his men to put on their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
to be in a readineſs to do as they ſhould be
appointed: The <hi>Perſians</hi> incamped by themſelves,
and <hi>Beſſus</hi> remained amongſt the <hi>Bactrians,</hi> practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to carry away the <hi>Perſians</hi> into <hi>Bactria,</hi> and to
leave <hi>Darius;</hi> ſignifying to them the riches of that
Region yet untouched, and the peril they were in if
they remained there; but they were all in a manner
of one Opinion, that it was an over-great offence
for them to forſake their Prince.</p>
            <p>In the mean ſeaſon, <hi>Artabaſus</hi> executed the Kings
Office, and went amongſt the <hi>Perſians</hi> in their lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
admoniſhing and exhorting them, ſometimes
apart, and otherwhile all together, and would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
leave them, before it appeared that they would
do as the King would have them. That done, with
great pain and difficulty, he perſwaded <hi>Darius</hi> to
take his meat, and ſet his minde upon his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Beſſus</hi> and <hi>Nabarzanes</hi> were ſo greedy to get
the Government into their hands, that they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to put in execution the thing they had long
conſpired betwixt them; for ſo long as <hi>Darius</hi> was
in ſafety, they could not hope to compaſs nor attain
ſo great Authority. The Majeſty of a King is had
in great Veneration amongſt thoſe Nations, at
whoſe Name only they aſſemble together; and the
Reverence uſed to them in their proſperity, cauſeth
men to ſhew them the like obedience in adverſity:
The greatneſs and power of thoſe Countries, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:46658:108"/>
of <hi>Beſſus</hi> and <hi>Nabarzanes</hi> had the Rule, not being
inferiour to any other Nations in that part of the
world, either in men, in furniture, or largeneſs of
their Territory, gave a great incouragement unto
their wicked diſpoſitions, in attempting of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
For they poſſeſſing the third part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> were
able to make as great a number of men as <hi>Darius</hi>
before had loſt. In confidence whereof, they not
only deſpiſed <hi>Darius,</hi> but <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing,
when they were once become Lords of that
Country, to re-inforce from thence again the power
of the Empire, and maintain the Wars againſt the
<hi>Macedons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they had long deviſed and debated theſe
things, they determined to take <hi>Darius</hi> by the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrian</hi>
Souldiers, of whom they had the Rule; and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to ſend word to <hi>Alexander,</hi> that they reſerved
him alive, to deliver him into his hands: And if ſo
be that <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould not not accept it, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they doubted, then their purpoſe was to kill
<hi>Darius,</hi> and with their power to fly into <hi>Bactria.</hi>
But for ſo much as they ſaw that <hi>Darius</hi> could not be
taken openly, ſeeing there were ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
ready to aid him, and fearing alſo the fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> they determined to work by
ſlight, the thing that they could not bring to paſs by
force. The plot was, to counterfeit a repentance
of their former doings, in excuſing unto the King
the fear they were in, and in the mean ſeaſon, they
ſent certain to practiſe with the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and to
prove their mindes. The Souldiers were toſſed to
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> with hope and fear; ſometime they thought,
that by leaving of their King, they ſhould commit
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:46658:108"/>
themſelves to manifeſt ruine and deſtruction: And
again, they remembred what entertainment was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
them in <hi>Bactria,</hi> that lay open for them, where
they ſhould be received with ſuch gifts and riches,
as they could not well imagine.</p>
            <p>Whiles <hi>Beſſus</hi> and <hi>Nabarzanes</hi> were beating of
theſe things in their heads, <hi>Artabaſus</hi> came unto
them, declaring how <hi>Darius</hi> was well pacified, and
that they might, if they would, be in the ſame
Eſtate and Degree with him that they were before.
Thereupon they fell to weeping, and purging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
requiring <hi>Artabaſus,</hi> that he would take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him the defence of their Cauſe, and carry their
Requeſt and Submiſſion unto the King. The night
was conſumed in this kinde of buſineſs: When it
was day, <hi>Nabarzanes,</hi> with the <hi>Bactrian</hi> Souldiers,
ſtood at the Entry of the Kings Lodging, colouring
his privy Treaſon with the ſolemn pretence of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his duty: <hi>Darius</hi> cauſed warning to be given
for his remove; and ſo mounted upon his Chariot,
after his accuſtomed manner. <hi>Nabarzanes,</hi> and the
other Traytors, fell upon the ground to worſhip him,
and ſhed tears in token of repentance; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that they determined ſhortly after to put
him in Fetters; ſo apt is the nature of man to diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation.
<hi>Darius</hi> being of a ſimple and gentle
Nature, was inforced through their behaviour, not
only to believe what they pretended, but alſo it
cauſed him to weep for joy: yet that could not
cauſe the Traytors to alter their purpoſe, when
they perceived what kinde of man, and what
manner of Prince they went about to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>.
<hi>Darius</hi> doubting nothing of his peril that was next
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:46658:109"/>
at hand, made all the haſte he could to eſcape
<hi>Alexander,</hi> whom he only doubted. <hi>Patron,</hi> that
was Captain of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> commanded his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to put on their Harneſs, which they carried
before in Truſſes, and to be ready, and attend to
every thing that ſhould be appointed them: For he
underſtanding the Treaſon that was contrived, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the Kings Chariot, ſeeking occaſion to ſpeak
with him.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Beſſus</hi> doubting the ſame thing, would not
depart from the Chariot, but followed rather as
a Watch then a Waiter. <hi>Patron</hi> therefore having
tarried long, and being interrupted oftentimes as he
was about to ſpeak, ſtood in a ſtay, betwixt fear
and fidelity, beholding the King in the face. When
<hi>Darius</hi> perceived that he beheld him after that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
he willed <hi>Bubace,</hi> his Eunuch, that rode next
him, to enquire of <hi>Patron</hi> if he had any thing to ſay
to him: <hi>Patron</hi> ſaid, <hi>Yea:</hi> but his matter was ſuch,
as he would no man ſhould hear. Then he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to come near; and (without any Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
<hi>Darius</hi> underſtanding ſomewhat of the <hi>Greek</hi>
Tongue, <hi>Patron</hi> ſaid unto him:</p>
            <p>Sir; Of fifty thouſand <hi>Greeks</hi> that ſerved you,
there is a ſmall number of us remaining, which have
continually followed you in all Fortunes, bearing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you the ſame fidelity and affection that we did in
your moſt flouriſhing Eſtate: And we were determined,
whereſoever you are, to take that for our Country and
home; both Proſperity and Adverſity hath ſo coupled
us together: By which Invincible Fidelity that is in
us, I deſire you, and require you, that you would
vouchſafe to lodge within our Camp, and ſuffer us
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:46658:109"/>
us to be the Guard of your Perſon. We have loſt
<hi>Greece,</hi> we have no <hi>Bactria</hi> to go unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all our h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pe
is in you; and the gods grant that all other men may
do the like. It is not neceſſary I ſhould ſpeak any
more; nor would I demand the cuſtody of your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
being an Alien and a Stranger, if I knew that
others were as well-minded towards you.</p>
            <p>Although <hi>Beſſus</hi> were ignorant of the <hi>Greek</hi>
Tongue, yet his Conſcience pricked him to believe,
that <hi>Patron</hi> had diſcloſed ſomething; and therefore
carrying away ſome part of his words, by a <hi>Greek</hi>
Interpreter became out of doubt: <hi>Darius</hi> nothing
afraid, as it appeared by his Countenance, enquired
of <hi>Patron</hi> what moved him to give ſuch advice?
Whereupon, he thought not good to defer it any
longer, but ſaid; Beſſus <hi>and</hi> Nabarzanes <hi>work
Treaſon againſt you, ſo that your Life and your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
ſtand in extreme peril; and this day ſhall be the
laſt, either to the Traytors, or to you.</hi> Whoſe words,
if <hi>Darius</hi> had well weighed and regarded, <hi>Patron</hi>
had received the glory of the preſervation of the
Prince. But let them mock that liſt, who ſay that
the ſtate of men is governed by Chance: I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
every man runneth his Race by an Immutable
Order, and by a concatenation everlaſting appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unknown, appointed long before. <hi>Darius</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
was:</p>
            <p>That although the fidelity of the <hi>Greek</hi> Souldiers
was ſufficiently known unto him, yet he was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
never to depart from his own Nation, by whom
though he might be deceived, yet it was hard for him
to miſtruſt them: Whatſoever ſhould befall him, <hi>he
ſaid,</hi> he was minded rather to ſuffer it amongſt his
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:46658:110"/>
own Subjects, then to part away from them; not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
to live, if his own Souldiers deſired not his
Safeguard.</p>
            <p>Whereupon <hi>Patron</hi> deſpairing of the Kings wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
returned them of whom he had the charge,
ready to adventure any thing for his ſake. <hi>Beſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
in the mean ſeaſon, had abſolutely determined
to ſlay <hi>Darius;</hi> but fearing that he could not win
<hi>Alexanders</hi> favour, except he delivered his Enemy
into his hands alive, deferred his purpoſe to the
night following.</p>
            <p>In the mean ſeaſon, he came to <hi>Darius,</hi> and gave
him thanks that he had ſo warily, and with ſuch
wiſdom, avoided the Treaſon of that falſe <hi>Grecian,</hi>
who being corrupted by <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but how to make a preſent of his head;
whereat (he ſaid) <hi>He could not marvel that a Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
man ſhould leave any thing undone for Money,
being without any Pledge of his Honeſty, without
houſe and home, baniſhed out of the world; a fair
Friend, and a doubtful Enemy; toſſed here and there
at the beck of all men that would corrupt him.</hi>
And then he fell to purging of himſelf, calling the
gods of his Country to witneſs his Innocency in
this matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Darius,</hi> by his countenance, ſeemed to believe
him; yet he doubted not of the truth of what <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron</hi>
had told him: but he was come to ſuch a point,
that it was as dangerous for him not to believe his
own men, as to be deceived. There were thirty
thouſand, whoſe lightneſs was feared to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to this Conſpiracy; and <hi>Patron</hi> had but four
thouſand, unto whom if he had committed his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>afe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:46658:110"/>
and thereby condemned the fidelity of his own
Nation, he ſaw that then they might have had a
goodly colour and pretence to perform their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize;
and therefore choſe rather to be killed
Innocently, then to give any occaſion whereby he
ſhould ſeem to have deſerved death: And yet when
<hi>Beſſus</hi> purged himſelf, he anſwered, <hi>That he knew
that there was no leſs Juſtice in</hi> Alexander, <hi>then
Manhood; and that they were deceived that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for any Rewards of Treaſon at his hands; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there was none a greater Puniſher or Revenger
of the breach of Fidelity.</hi> When the night drew
near, the <hi>Perſians,</hi> after their accuſtomed manner,
put off their Armour, and repaired to the next Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
to provide things neceſſary: But the <hi>Bactri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
as <hi>Beſſus</hi> had commanded them, ſtood ſtill arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
In the mean ſeaſon, <hi>Darius</hi> had ſent for <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſus,</hi>
and ſhewed him what <hi>Patron</hi> had declared:
Whereupon <hi>Artabaſus</hi> made no doubt, but that he
would ſtraightways commit himſelf among the
<hi>Greeks;</hi> thinking that the <hi>Perſians,</hi> when the Kings
peril ſhould be publiſhed abroad, would joyn with
the <hi>Grecians:</hi> Yet <hi>Darius,</hi> predeſtinate to his chance,
could not hear that ſaving counſel, nor ſought for
any help in that caſe, but imbraced <hi>Artabaſus,</hi> as
though he ſhould never ſee him more; and being
wet with the tears that one of them let fall upon
the other, he cauſed <hi>Artabaſus</hi> to be removed from
him; and becauſe he would not ſee his ſorrow in
departing from him, he covered his face, and fell
flat upon the ground: Then ſuch as were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
to the Guard of his Perſon, who ſhould
have been his Defence in all perils, fled away,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:46658:111"/>
thinking themſelves over-weak for ſuch a number of
armed men as they ſuppoſed to be coming: There
was a great ſolitarineſs within <hi>Darius</hi> his lodging;
for none remained about the King but a few Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs,
that had no place to repair unto: Then he
debated and deviſed with himſelf alone, ſometime
one thing, and ſometime another; and anon he
waxed weary of that ſolitarineſs, in which before
he took a comfort, and called <hi>Bubace</hi> unto him,
whom he beheld, and ſaid:</p>
            <p>Go, provide for your ſelves, who, according to your
duties, have been true to your Prince till the laſt hour;
here I do tarry for the fatal Law of my deſtiny: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
you do marvel that I do not end mine own
life; I had rather dye through other mens wickedneſs,
then by mine own.</p>
            <p>After theſe words, <hi>Bubace</hi> filled both the Kings
lodging, and alſo the whole Camp with mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and lamentation; and divers brake into the
place where <hi>Darius</hi> was, and tearing their cloaths,
bewailed his caſe with a great lamentation. When
the cry came unto the <hi>Perſians,</hi> they were ſo ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
with fear, that they durſt neither put on their
Armour, leſt they might give occaſion to the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrians</hi>
to ſet upon them; nor could they remain
quiet, leſt they might ſo wickedly leave their
King.</p>
            <p>Then were clamours heard throughout the Camp
of divers ſorts, without any Head, and without any
appointment. Such as pertained to <hi>Nabarzanes</hi>
and <hi>Beſſus,</hi> deceived by ſuch lamentation as they
heard, brought tydings to the reſt, that the King
had killed himſelf: Whereupon, they repaired thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:46658:111"/>
ſo faſt as they could gallop; and ſuch Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
after, as were choſen to be Miniſters of their Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.
When they were entred into the Kings Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilion,
becauſe the Eunuchs declared that he was
alive, they commanded him to be bound.</p>
            <p>Thus he, who before was carried in a Chariot,
and honoured of his men like a god, was made
a priſoner by his own Servants, without any For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Power; and put into a vile Cart, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
over with Beaſts skins: and ſpoil was made of
the Kings Stuff, in ſuch ſort, as if it had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the Wars. When they had laden themſelves
with the Prey got after ſo ſoul a manner, they
conveyed themſelves into their Countries: But <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabaſus,</hi>
with thoſe of whom he had the charge, and
with the <hi>Greek</hi> Souldiers, took their way towards
<hi>Parthina;</hi> thinking to be more ſure any where,
then in the Fellowſhip of thoſe Traytors. The
<hi>Perſians,</hi> whom <hi>Beſſus</hi> had overcome with ſo many
fair promiſes, ſpecially becauſe they had no other
man to follow, joyned themſelves to the <hi>Bactrians,</hi>
and the third day overtook them. But to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<hi>Darius</hi> ſhould not want ſuch honour as was
due to his Eſtate, <hi>Beſſus</hi> cauſed him to be bound
with Golden Fetters; ſuch were the deſpites that
his Fortune made him ſubject unto: And for that
he ſhould not be known by his Apparel, they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the Cart with foul Hides of Beaſts, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
unknown men to drive it forwards: and leſt
by enquiry in the Army he might be diſcovered,
ſuch as had the charge of him followed afar off.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> heard that <hi>Darius</hi> was removed
to <hi>Ecbatana,</hi> he left the way that he was in, and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:46658:112"/>
with all the ſpeed he could make followed after
<hi>Darius,</hi> who was ſaid to be gone into <hi>Media.</hi> But
when <hi>Alexander</hi> was come to <hi>Taba,</hi> which is the
Chief City of <hi>Paratacene,</hi> it was there ſhewed him
by Fugitives that came out of <hi>Darius</hi> Camp, how
he was fled with all ſpeed into <hi>Bactria;</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
underſtood the matter more certainly by <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtines</hi>
of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who could not ſay directly, that
<hi>Darius</hi> was uſed as a priſoner; but ſaid, that either
he was in danger of death, or of captivity. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
upon that intelligence, called his Captains to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and ſhewed them that he had a great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize,
but ſuch a one as the travel was very ſhort;
<hi>Darius</hi> (he ſaid) was not far off, forſaken of his
own men; and either taken as a priſoner, or elſe
ſlain: in whoſe perſon he ſhewed the whole Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to conſiſt, and the greatneſs of the matter to
be a reward of their haſte making. They all cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with one voice, that they were ready to follow
him whereſoever he ſhould go; and that he ſhould
not ſpare their labour, nor their peril: Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he conveyed his Army forwards with marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
ſpeed, rather in Poſt, then after the common
order of Marching; neither reſting day nor night,
till they paſſed five hundred furlongs, and came
to the Bridge where <hi>Darius</hi> was taken: There
<hi>Melun, Darius</hi> Interpreter, who by reaſon of his
ſickneſs could not follow the Army, was taken by
<hi>Alexanders</hi> celerity; who feigning that he fled
from his Maſter, declared the whole matter: But
how great ſoever his deſire was to overtake his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
it was neceſſary for him to give his men reſt
in their travel: So that determining to leave the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:46658:112"/>
reſt of his Army behinde, he did chuſe out ſix
thouſand Horſemen, and added to them three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
called <hi>Dimichas,</hi> that were Footmen, heavy
harneſſed, but yet riding on Horſeback; and when
the occaſion required, alighted and fought on
foot. When <hi>Alexander</hi> was taking order about
theſe things, <hi>Orſellus</hi> and <hi>Mithracenes,</hi> who for the
hatred they bare to <hi>Beſſus</hi> for his Treaſon, fled from
him, declared to the King, that the <hi>Perſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ans</hi> were
but five hundred furlongs off, and proffered to
guide him by a nearer way. Their coming was
grateful to the King; for by their Conduct, in the
beginning of the night, he took his journey with
ſuch Horſemen as he had appointed, willing his
Foot-Battel to follow after with all ſpeed poſſible.
He marched forwards in a ſquare Battel; and kept
ſuch an order, that the firſt might joyn with the
laſt, and ſuch as came behinde relieve them that
went before.</p>
            <p>When they had paſſed three hundred furlongs
on their way, <hi>Broculus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Mazeus,</hi> that
ſometime had been Governour of <hi>Syria,</hi> met <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
and declared, that <hi>Beſſus</hi> was within two
hundred furlongs, marching with his men out of
all order, as one that did caſt no doubts: It ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him (he ſaid) that they went towards <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cania;</hi>
wherefore, if haſte were made, they might
ſoon be overtaken, and found diſperſed out of all
Array. And by reaſon he affirmed alſo, that <hi>Darius</hi>
was yet alive, <hi>Alexander</hi> that was hot before in the
purſuit, was with his words much more quickned
forwards; ſo that he cauſed them to put Spurs to
their Horſes, and in a gallop followed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo faſt, that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:46658:113"/>
they might hear the noiſe of their Enemies as they
marched: but the duſt that did riſe, obſured their
ſight; and therefore he ſtayed a while, till the duſt
was vaniſhed away: Then both <hi>Beſſus</hi> perceived
the <hi>Macedons,</hi> and they ſaw the <hi>Perſians</hi> as they
fled; notwithſtanding, they had not been able to
have marched with them, if <hi>Beſſus</hi> had had as great
courage to fight, as he had to betray his Maſter:
For beſides that they exceeded the <hi>Macedons</hi> in
number and power, the <hi>Macedons</hi> fore-wearied
and over-travelled, ſhould have had to do with
them that were luſty and freſh: But the Name of
<hi>Alexander,</hi> and his Fame, which was of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Wars, put them in ſuch fear, that they
could not ſtay themſelves.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Beſſus,</hi> and others that were Partners in
this Conſpiracy, came to the Cart where <hi>Darius</hi>
was, and perſwaded him to leap on Horſeback,
and fly from his Enemies that were at hand: But
he cryed out, that the gods were come to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
and calling for the aſſiſtance of <hi>Alexander,</hi>
ſaid, <hi>That in no wiſe he would go with Traytors:</hi>
Whereat they were ſo ſtirred to wrath, that they
threw darts at him, and left him wounded in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places of his body: They thruſt the Beaſts into
their bodies that drew the Cart, to the intent
they ſhould not be able to paſs forwards, and ſlew
his two Servants that did attend upon him. When
they had committed this act, they thought it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to diſperſe themſelves in their flying; and ſo
<hi>Nabarzanes</hi> took his way to <hi>Hircania,</hi> and <hi>Beſſus</hi> to
<hi>Bactria,</hi> with a few Horſemen that each of them
had in their Company.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:46658:113"/>
When their Souldiers were thus forſaken of their
Captains, they were ſcattered here and there, as
their fear did lead them: There were only five
hundred Horſemen who aſſembled themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and ſtood in a doubt, whether it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to reſiſt, or to fly. <hi>Alexander</hi> underſtanding the
fear his Enemies were in, ſent <hi>Nicanor</hi> before with
part of his Horſemen to keep them on work, and
he with the reſt followed after. There were ſlain
to the number of three thouſand of ſuch as ſtood
on their defence, and the reſt were driven in flocks
like beaſts, from killing of whom, <hi>Alexander</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his men to abſtain. Amongſt all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
there was none that was able to ſhew the
Cart that carried <hi>Darius;</hi> for every one was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to finde him, that as they ſaw any Cart,
they ſought him therein, and yet they could not
perceive by any means what was become of him.
<hi>Alexander</hi> made ſuch haſte, that ſcarcely three
thouſand Horſemen followed him of all his Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
but great numbers of the Perſians fell into their
Laps that followed behinde. It is ſcarcely to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
that there ſhould be more priſoners taken,
then there were men to take them: But Fortune in
that fear had ſo taken away their ſenſe, that they
could not conſider their own multitude, nor the
ſmall number of their Enemies. In the mean ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
the Beaſts which drew <hi>Darius</hi> Waggon, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no man to govern them, were ſwerved out
of the high-way, and wandring here and there,
had drawn <hi>Darius</hi> four furlongs from the place
where he was wounded, into a Valley, where they
fainted, by reaſon of their heat and their hurts.

There was a Spring at hand, which certain that
knew the Country had ſhewed to <hi>Poliſtratus</hi> a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi>
that was overcome with thirſt: and while
he was drinking the water out of his Helmet, he
eſpied the Beaſts that were thruſt in with Darts;
and marvelling that they were not rather carried
away, then hurt after that manner, he looked,
and found in the Waggon the body of a man half
alive; and at length perceived it was <hi>Darius</hi> that
lay there ſore wounded, and drawing his laſt
breath: Then <hi>Poliſtratus</hi> brought to him a <hi>Perſian,</hi>
whom he had taken priſoner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom when <hi>Darius</hi>
knew by his voice to be of his Country, he ſaid,
<hi>That he took it for ſome comfort in his preſent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
that he ſhould ſpeak before he died to one
that underſtood him, and not utter his laſt words in
vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He required him to declare unto <hi>Alexander,</hi> that
though he had never deſerved any thing at his hands,
yet it was his chance to die greatly his Debtor; and
had thanks to give him, for the favour and goodneſs
that he had ſhewed towards his Mother, his Wife, and
his Children, to whom he had not only granted life,
but alſo the Reverence due to their former Eſtate and
Dignity; whereas he, of his own Kinſmen and Friends,
to whom he had given both Life and Lands, was now
by them bereaved of all. He prayed therefore, that
he might always be Conquerour, and that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
of the whole world might come into his hands;
requiring, that he would not neglect to take revenge
of ſo foul an act, not only for his cauſe, but for an
example, and for the honour of other Princes; which
ſhould be a thing worthy of him, and profitable to his
Succeſſors in time to come.</p>

               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:46658:116"/>
               <hi>When he had ſpoke theſe words, he fainted, and
calling for water, after he had drunk, ſaid to</hi> Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus
<hi>that preſented it unto him:</hi> Whatſoever thou
art, this is unto me the laſt miſery in all my adverſe

            <p>Having ſpoken theſe words, and given <hi>Poliſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>

to <hi>Alexander,</hi> he repaired where the dead
Corpſe lay, and with tears lamented, that it was his

            <argument>
               <p>A great part of the Sixth Book is defective; wherein
was contained the Cauſe of the War betwixt the
<hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and <hi>Macedons,</hi> with the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of both Nations to the Battel that was fought
betwixt <hi>Antipater, Alexanders</hi> Lieutenant in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,
and the Kings of the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>HE preſſed forwards where the fight was moſt
dangerous, and put the greater part of his
Enemies to flight: Then ſuch as were Conquerours
before began to fly, till they had drawn their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
greedily following them, out of the ſtreight,
into a more plain ground: In the Retreat many of
them were ſlain; but when they had once reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
ſuch a ground where they might ſtay and fall
in order, the Battels joyned equal on both ſides.
Amongſt them all, the King of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi>
appeared moſt notable in all mens eyes, not ſo
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:46658:117"/>
much by the beauty of his Armour and goodly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage,
as through the greatneſs of his courage,
wherein only he could not be overcome. He was
aſſailed at on all parts, both near at hand, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far
off: Yet for all that, he endured long in Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his Enemies, avoiding their ſtrokes, part with
his Target, and part with his Body, till ſuch time
as he was thruſt through both Thighs with a
Spear, when by great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>uſion of blood, he was not
able any longer to endure the fight: Then the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquires
of his body took him up upon his Target,
and carried him into their Camp, when with great
pain he indured the ſtirring of his wounds. The
<hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> for all their Kings departure, gave
not over the fight; but as ſoon as they could reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any ground of advantage, they rallied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and received ſtoutly their Enemies that came
full upon them. There is not ſound in any memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
of a Battel more vehemently fought then that,
where the Armies of two Nations that were moſt
excellent in the Wars, contended together for the
Victory, not yet inclining to any part: The <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians</hi>
called to minde their Ancient Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
and Proweſs, and the <hi>Macedons</hi> conſidered
their preſent eſtimation they had in the world:
The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſtrived for their liberty, and
the <hi>Macedons</hi> for the Soveraignty; the one part
lacked a Captain, and the other room to fight in.
The manifold adventures and chances that fell that
day, encreaſed both the hope and fear of both
parties; fortune, as it were of purpoſe, bringing ſuch
valiant men to fight together, neither of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
upon other: But the ſtreightneſs of the place
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:46658:118"/>
where they fought, did not ſuffer them to joyn
with their whole force at once, for more were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders
then fighters; and ſuch as ſtood without
danger, encouraged the others with their cry. At
length the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> began to faint, and
ſcarcely able for ſweating to ſuſtain their Armour,
began to draw back, to have the more liberty to
flee from their Enemies that preſſed ſore upon
them.</p>
            <p>When they were once broken and ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
the Conquerours purſued after; and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the place whereupon the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
was firſt arranged, made a ſore purſuit upon
<hi>Agis:</hi> who ſeeing his men flying, and his Enemies
approach at hand, willed his men to ſet him down;
where ſtretching himſelf, to feel if the force of his
body could anſwer unto his heart, when he found
himſelf unable to ſtand, remaining upon his knees,
put on his Helmet; and covering his body with
his Target, ſhaked his Spear, and provoked his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to draw near, if any were deſirous of his
ſpoil: but there was not one that preſſed near him,
but did caſt Darts afar off, which he always took,
and threw at his Enemies again, till ſuch time as
he was thruſt into the bare breaſt with a Spear: But
when the ſame was pulled out of the wound, he
fainted; and bowing himſelf upon his Target,
ſhortly after fell down dead, blood and life failing
both together. There were ſlain of the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
5340, and of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> not above
three hundred; but there was ſcarcely any of them
that eſcaped unwounded. This Victory not only
brake the hearts of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and of their
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:46658:118"/>
Confederates; but alſo of others who lay in wait,
looking for the ſucceſs of that War.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antipater</hi> was not ignorant how the countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of ſuch as did gratifie his Victory, differed
much from the intents of their hearts: but deſirous
to finiſh the Wars that were begun, he perceived
it neceſſary for him to diſſemble, and ſuffer himſelf
to be deceived: And though he rejoyced much in
the Fortune of the Battel, yet he feared the envy
that might enſue thereof, it being a greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then the Eſtate of a Lieutenant did bear. For
<hi>Alexander</hi> was of ſuch a nature, that he deſired his
Enemies had won the Victory; ſhewing manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that he was not contented with <hi>Antipaters</hi> good
ſucceſs; thinking that whatſoever chanced to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man, was a derogation to his own glory.
<hi>Antipater</hi> therefore, who knew full well his ſtomack,
durſt not uſe the Victory according to his will, but
aſſembled a Councel of <hi>Greeks,</hi> to adviſe what
they thought expedient: The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> made
no other requeſt, but that they might ſend Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours
to <hi>Alexander,</hi> who upon their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
to him, and their ſuit made, obtained a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Pardon for all men, ſaving for ſuch as were
the Authors of the Rebellion. The <hi>Megapolitans,</hi>
whoſe City did abide the Siege, were compelled to
pay, as a Fine for their Rebellion, twenty Talents to
the <hi>Athenians</hi> and the <hi>Aetolians.</hi> This was the end
of the War, which being ſuddenly begun, was
ended before <hi>Alexander</hi> had overthrown <hi>Darius</hi> at
<hi>Arbella.</hi> As ſoon as his minde was delivered of
thoſe preſent cares, as one that could bear better
the wars then quietneſs, he gave himſelf up to
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:46658:119"/>
pleaſures, by the vices whereof he was overcome,
whom no power of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> or any other, were
able to ſubdue. He was given to banqueting out
of ſeaſon, and to a fond delight of drinking, and
watching in Plays amongſt Flocks of Concubines,
that drew him into ſtrange manners and cuſtomes:
which he following, as things more pleaſing then
his Country Cuſtomes, offended thereby greatly
both the eyes and the hearts of his Nation; and
cauſed many that loved him before entirely, to hate
him then as an Enemy: For the <hi>Macedons,</hi> that
were obſtinate in keeping their own Diſcipline, and
unaccuſtomed to be curious, being ſo penurious in
their Diet as might ſuffice Nature only, when they
ſaw him go about to bring in amongſt them the
Vices of thoſe Nations which they had ſubdued,
Conſpiracies began to be made againſt him, Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
aroſe amongſt the Souldiers, and every one
complaining to another, freely uttered their griefs,
whereby he was provoked to wrath, to ſuſpition,
and ſudden fear; Divers other inconveniencies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
thereupon, which ſhall be declared hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> being given, as hath been ſaid before,
to unreaſonable banqueting, wherein he conſumed
both day and night; when he was ſatisfied with
eating and drinking, he paſſed the reſt of the time
in Plays and Paſtimes: And not contented with
ſuch Muſitians as he brought out of <hi>Greece,</hi> cauſed
the Women, that were Captives, to ſing before him
ſuch Songs as abhorred the ears of the <hi>Macedons,</hi>
not accuſtomed to ſuch things. Amongſt thoſe
Women, <hi>Alexander</hi> eſpied one more ſad then the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:46658:119"/>
reſt, who with a certain ſhamefac'dneſs did ſtrive
with them that brought her forth: She was of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Beauty, and by her Modeſty her Beauty was
much augmented: And becauſe ſhe did caſt her
eyes towards the earth, and covered her face ſo
much as ſhe might, ſhe gave ſuſpition for him to
think that ſhe was deſcended of Noble Parentage:
And therefore being demanded what ſhe was, ſhe
ſhewed her ſelf to be the Ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce of <hi>Occhus</hi> that late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reigned in <hi>Perſia;</hi> and the Wife of <hi>Hiſtaſpis,</hi> who
was <hi>Darius</hi> Kinſman, and had been his Lieutenant
over many great Armies. There yet remained in
the Kings heart ſome ſmall ſparks of his former
Vertue; for in reſpect of her Eſtate, being deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the Blood of Kings, and in Reverence he
bare to ſuch a Name as the Niece of <hi>Occhus,</hi> he
commanded her not only to be ſet free, but alſo to
be reſtored to her Goods, and her Husband, whom
he willed to be ſought out.</p>
            <p>The next day he appointed <hi>Epheſtion</hi> to bring all
the priſoners to the Court, where inquiring of the
Nobility of every one, he commanded them who
were deſcended of Noble Blood, to be ſevered from
the reſt; amongſt whom they found <hi>Oxatres,</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>Darius,</hi> that was no leſs Noble of minde
then of blood: There were made of the laſt ſpoil
twenty ſix thouſand Talents, whereof twelve
thouſand were conſumed in rewards amongſt the
Men of War; and the ſum amounted to no leſs va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
that was conveyed away by them that had the
keeping thereof. There was one <hi>Oxidates,</hi> a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-man
of <hi>Perſia,</hi> that was impriſoned by <hi>Darius,</hi>
and appointed to ſuffer death, whom <hi>Alexander</hi>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:46658:120"/>
delivered, and gave unto him the Seignory of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>
and received <hi>Darius</hi> Brother amongſt the
number of his Friends, reſerving to him all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
honour of his Nobility. Then they came
to the Country of <hi>Parthenia,</hi> being then but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
and unknown, but now the Head of all thoſe
Countries which lye upon <hi>Tygris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi>
and bounded with the Red Sea. This Country
being fruitful and abundant in all things, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
by the <hi>Scythians,</hi> who poſſeſſing part of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi>
and <hi>Europe,</hi> are troubleſome Neighbours to them
both.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scythians,</hi> who inhabit upon the <hi>Boſpheron</hi>
Sea, are aſcribed to be in <hi>Aſia;</hi> and ſuch as be in
<hi>Europe,</hi> poſſeſs the Countries lying on the left part
of <hi>Thrace,</hi> ſo far as <hi>Boriſthenes;</hi> and from thence
right forth, ſo far as the River <hi>Thanais,</hi> that parteth
<hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia.</hi> It is certain, that the <hi>Scythians</hi>
of whom the <hi>Perſians</hi> be deſcended, came not from
<hi>Boſpheron,</hi> but out of <hi>Europe.</hi> There was a Noble
City, in thoſe days called <hi>Hecatonphilos,</hi> builded by
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> where <hi>Alexander</hi> remained with his
Army, conveying Victuals thither from all parts.
Among the Souldiers lying in idleneſs, there aroſe
ſuddenly a rumour, which entred into their heads
without any certain Author or beginning, which
was, that <hi>Alexander</hi> ſatisfied with the Acts he had
done, purpoſed immediately to return into <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
This Fame was not ſo ſoon blown abroad,
but that they ran like mad-men to their lodgings,
and truſſed up their Baggage and their Stuff, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ſuch preparation to depart, that every man
judged warning to be given to remove, and that
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:46658:120"/>
the thing had been done by appointment. The tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
that did riſe in the Camp by lading of Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and by the calling which one made to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
came unto the Kings ears. This rumour ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the ſooner credit, by the diſpatch of certain
<hi>Greek</hi> Souldiers, whom <hi>Alexander</hi> had diſmiſſed
into their Country, with the gift of ſix thouſand
Deniers to every Horſeman: Thereupon occaſion
was given to think that the War had been at an end.
<hi>Alexander,</hi> whoſe purpoſe was to paſs into <hi>India,</hi>
and the uttermoſt bounds of the Orient, was no
leſs diſpleaſed at this rumour then the caſe required:
And therefore calling before him the Captains of
his Army, with the tears in his eyes, he made a
great complaint unto them, that in the middle
courſe of his glory he ſhould thus be pulled back,
and compelled to return into his Country, rather
as a man vanquiſhed, then as a Victor: Which miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
he ſaid, he could not impute to his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
nor judge that their cowardlineſs did give
an impediment to his proceedings, but that it was
only the envy of the gods that put ſo ſudden a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of their Country into the mindes of valiant
men, who within a while ſhould have returned
with greater glory and fame. Thereupon they all
promiſed to travel in Reformation of the matter,
offering themſelves in all things (were they never
ſo difficult) to do as he would have them: And
they promiſed alſo the obedience of the Souldiers,
if ſo be that he would make ſome gentle and apt O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to pacifie them, who were never yet ſeen to
depart from him in any deſperation or diſturbance
of minde, if they once beheld the chearfulneſs
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:46658:121"/>
of his Countenance, and the courage proceeding
from his heat. He promiſed ſo to do, and required
in the multitude an inclination to give ear unto
him. When all things were prepared which were
thought expedient for this purpoſe, he aſſembled
all his Army together, and made this Oration unto
them:</p>
            <p>When ye conſider (my Souldiers) the greatneſs of
the Acts which ye have done, and the manifold Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
that ye have made, it is no marvel at all that ye
be inclined to quietneſs, and fully ſatisfied with Fame
and Glory: For not to ſpeak of the <hi>Illyrians</hi> and
<hi>Tribals,</hi> of <hi>Boetia, Thracia,</hi> and <hi>Sparta,</hi> of the
<hi>Achaians</hi> and <hi>Peloponneſians,</hi> whom I have ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
part in perſon, and the reſt by appointment; I
will not make rehearſal of the War we began at <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſpont,</hi>
and how we delivered from ſervitude the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Nations, the <hi>Ionians</hi> and <hi>Aeolides,</hi> and got
unto our poſſeſſion <hi>Caria, Lydia, Cappadocia, Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,
Paphlagonia, Pamphilia, Pyſidia, Celicia, Syria,
Phenicia, Armenia, Perſia, Media,</hi> and <hi>Partheniae.</hi>
We have gotten more Countries, then others have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Cities; and yet (I am ſure) the number of them
have cauſed me to leave ſome of them unrehearſed. If
I could think that the poſſeſſion of theſe Lands that
we have conquered in ſo ſhort time could remain ſure
unto us, then (my Souldiers) I would, though it were
againſt your wills, break from you to viſit my houſe
and my home, to ſee my Mother, my Siſters, and my
Country-men, to enjoy there the Land and Glory that I
have gotten with you; where the joyful Converſation
of our Wives, our Children and Parents, our peace and
quietneſs, and a ſure poſſeſſion of things gotten through
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:46658:121"/>
our valour, do tarry for us, as large rewards of our
Victory. But if we will confeſs the truth, this new
Empire which we have not yet at Commandment, but
is kept, as it were, by way of intreaty, doth require a
time that this ſtiff-necked people may learn to bear our
yoke; and by framing their diſpoſitions to more Humu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
bring their cruel nature to a more civil converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Do we not ſee that the Corn in the field asketh
a time for its ripening; and though the ſame be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſenſe, yet hath it its courſe to be brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection?
Do you believe that ſo many Nations not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
with us in Religion, in Cuſtom, nor in one uſe
of Language, accuſtomed to the Empire and Name of
another man, will be conquered and brought to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
with the winning of one Battel? No, truſt me,
they are kept under with fear of our Power, and do not
obey us of their own good wills: And they which ſhew
you obedience when ye be here amongſt them, when you
be abſent will be your Enemies: You muſt think that
you have to do with wilde Beaſts, which being fierce
of Nature when they be firſt taken, muſt be ſhut up
and tamed by time. Hitherto I have reaſoned with you,
as though we had conquered the whole Dominion that
pertained to <hi>Darius,</hi> which is nothing ſo; for <hi>Nabar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanes</hi>
poſſeſſeth <hi>Hircania,</hi> and the Traytor <hi>Beſſus</hi> not
only enjoyeth <hi>Bactria,</hi> but alſo threatneth us. The
<hi>Sogdians, Dahans, Maſſagetes, Sagans,</hi> and the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
remain yet in their own Liberty and Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who ſhall not ſee our backs ſo ſoon turned, but
they will follow in our Rear: They all have a certain
Friendſhip and Amity one with another, but we are
all Strangers and Forreigners unto them: There is no
Creature but that will more gladly be obedient to Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:46658:122"/>
of his own Nation, then to Forreigners, be their
Government never ſo terrible. We are driven therefore
of neceſſity to purchaſe that we have not, or elſe to looſe
that we have already gained: As Phyſitians, that in
ſick bodies will leave no humour that may hurt, ſo
likewiſe we muſt cut away whatſoever ſhall be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
unto our Empire: Have you not ſeen great
fires to ariſe from ſmall ſparks not regarded? We may
not neglect any thing in our Enemies, whom the more
we deſpiſe, the more ſtrong we make them. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you ſhould not think it ſuch an impoſſibility for
<hi>Beſſus</hi> to make himſelf King, where a King is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
you ſhall underſtand that <hi>Darius</hi> came not to his

by the benefit of <hi>Bagoas</hi> his Eunuch. We commit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

heinous offence (my Souldiers) if we make war againſt
<hi>Darius,</hi> and put him down, for the intent to give his
Kingdom unto his ſervants; yea, and to ſuch a one
as attempted ſo vile an act againſt his Maſter, at ſuch
a time as he had moſt need of help, and whom we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Enemies, would have ſpared: He being his
ſubject, put him in chains as a Captive, and finally
ſlew him, becauſe he ſhould not be preſerved by us:

one that ſo vilely falſified his faith. If the report
ſhould come unto you in your own Countries, that the
ſame man was deſtroying of the <hi>Greek</hi> Cities about <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſpont,</hi>
how ſorry would you then be, and how much
would you lament that <hi>Beſſus</hi> ſhould enjoy that which
you have got, and uſurp the rewards of your Victory?
Then would you make haſte to recover your own; then
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:46658:122"/>
would you bend your ſelves to the Wars: But how
much better is it now to oppreſs him while he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in ſuch fear, and is uncertain what way to take?
Shall we forbear to ſpend four days to come to him,
that have marched over ſuch Snows, that have paſſed ſo
many Rivers, that have climbed ſo many Mountains, to
whoſe journey the flowing-Sea could be no impediment,
nor the Streights of <hi>Cilicia</hi> could ſhut up our way?
Now all things are made plain and open, and we ſtand
in the entry of our Victory: There are but a few Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives
and Killers of their Maſter that do remain.
What more notable work can you leave unto your Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,
to be regiſtred by Fame unto your glory, then
to revenge ſuch as were Traytors to <hi>Darius?</hi> You ſhall
thereby ſhew, that when you were Enemies unto him,
yet your hatred ended with his death, and that no
wicked man can eſcape your hands: Which thing if
you bring to paſs, how much more obedient do you think
the <hi>Perſians</hi> will be unto you, when they perceive you
to take juſt Wars in hand; and that it was not with
<hi>Beſſus</hi> name whereat ye are offended, but with his
ſins and treacheries?</p>
            <p>His Oration was received of the Souldiers with
ſuch gladneſs, that they ſtraightways deſire him
to lead them whither he would: And he that knew
well enough how to make uſe of this opportunity,
immediately advanced into <hi>Parthenia,</hi> and came
to the bounds of <hi>Hircania,</hi> leaving <hi>Craterus</hi> with
thoſe Regiments whereof he had the Rule, and ſix
thouſand Horſemen, of whom <hi>Amintas</hi> had the
charge, with the like number of Archers, to defend
<hi>Parthenia</hi> from the incurſion of the barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
He appointed <hi>Erigonus,</hi> with a ſmall power, to
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:46658:123"/>
attend upon his Carriages; willing him to paſs
with them through the plain Country, and he
himſelf with his Footmen, and with the reſt of his
Horſemen, marched forwards a hundred and fifty
furlongs, and incamped in a Valley at the entry into
<hi>Hircania.</hi> In the ſame place are great woods full
of high and thick Trees, and the bottom of the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
is very fruitful, by reaſon of the Springs that
come forth of the Rocks. Out of the foot of the
Mountains there ariſeth a River called <hi>Zieberis,</hi> which
within three furlongs of the head, is divided by a
Rock ſtanding in the midſt of the Stream, cauſing
the water to go two ſundry ways; which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
coming into one Channel, runneth more
violently then before, by reaſon of the fall from
the Rocks: And ſuddenly it ſinketh into the ground,
and ſo runneth hidden, by the ſpace of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
furlongs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then cometh forth again, as it
were, out of a new Spring, being then in bredth
thirteen furlongs; and as it runneth forwards,
groweth more narrow, and falleth into another
ſtream, named <hi>Rhydago.</hi> The Inhabitants of the
Country affirm, that any thing caſt in where the
Stream ſinks into the ground, will appear and
come out at the next Mouth of the River. For the
proving of which concluſion, <hi>Alexander</hi> cauſed
two Bulls to be caſt in, where the water ſank down,
whoſe bodies were found by ſuch as were appointed
for the purpoſe, to appear where the Stream brake
out again. In this place he refreſhed his Army
four days, during which time <hi>Nabarzanes</hi> (who
was Confederate with <hi>Beſſus</hi> in killing of the King)
did write Letters to him to this effect:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:46658:123"/>
How that he was no Enemy to <hi>Darius,</hi> but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled
him ever to do ſuch things as he judged moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable;
and for his faithful counſel, was put in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of his life by him, who againſt all reaſon intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to commit the cuſtody of his perſon to Strangers,
condemning thereby the fidelity of his own Nation,
which they had kept unſpotted towards their Kings the
ſpace of two hundred and thirty years: Therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf in that danger, he took counſel of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
neceſſity, and alledged, that nothing was more
dear to miſerable Mortality then life, for the love
whereof he was driven to this extremity, in commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
an act which neceſſity rather compelled him to do,
then his own diſpoſition: For in a general Calamity,
every man ſeeks after his own Fortune. If he would
command him to come to his preſence, <hi>he ſaid,</hi> he would
not refuſe to do it; for he could not fear that ſo great a
King would violate his promiſe, ſeeing one god is not
uſed to deceive another. But if he ſhould ſeem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of his aſſurance, there were many Countries
for him to fly unto; for all men having vertue in them,
count always that for their Country where they make
their reſidence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> made no ſtay to give him his word,
after ſuch ſort as the <hi>Perſians</hi> uſed to receive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
which was, ſafely to come and go: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
he marched in order of Battel, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ever Scouts before to diſcover the Country:
The light armed were appointed to the Vaward;
the <hi>Phalaux</hi> followed after, and the Baggage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde:
For by reaſon they were a warlike Nation,
and the Country hard to enter upon, it cauſed the
King to be circumſpect. The ſame Valley ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:46658:124"/>
to the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, the Banks thereof reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
the Horns of the Moon, before it cometh to
the full, the Sea lying betwixt them like a great
Bay. Upon the left hand the people inhabit, that
are called <hi>Cercetes,</hi> which lye open towards the
<hi>North;</hi> and upon the other part the <hi>Leucoſirians,
Moſſynes,</hi> and <hi>Chalibes;</hi> and the Plains of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazons</hi>
lye towards the <hi>Weſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sea, which ſome call the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, and
ſome the <hi>Hircanian,</hi> being more ſweet then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
bringeth forth Serpents of a wonderful big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and Fiſhes differing in colour much from all the
reſt. There be divers of opinion, that the Lake of
<hi>Meotis</hi> ſhould run into this Sea, which they conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
by the water, thinking the ſame to receive its
ſweetneſs of the Lake. Towards the <hi>North</hi> the Sea
groweth into a Beach, and ſhooteth forth his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
far upon the Land, which riſing high, make
many Mears and Plaſhes. And as by a conſtant
courſe of the Planets they flow out, ſo at a certain
time, by an Ebb, they return again, reſtoring the
ground to its former eſtate: Some believe theſe
waters to be no parcel of the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, but that
they come out of <hi>India,</hi> and run into <hi>Hircania,</hi>
which lieth low in the foreſaid Valley.</p>
            <p>The King being removed from that place, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
forwards twenty furlongs in a wilde Deſart,
where great woods hung continually over their
heads, and Brooks of water, and the dirt, gave
great impediment to their journey. But at length,
without any oppoſition of his Enemies, he paſſed
thoſe difficulties, and came unto a fair Country;
wherein, beſides other Victuals (wherewith it did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound)
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:46658:124"/>
there grew great plenty of Apples, and
the ground was very apt for Vines. There were
alſo plenty of a certain kinde of Trees much like
unto Oaks, whoſe leaves were covered with honey,
which the Inhabitants gather before the Sun-riſing;
for elſe the moiſture would be dried up with the
heat.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> had paſſed thirty furlongs fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Phrataphernes</hi> met him, yeilding both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and ſuch others as fled away after <hi>Darius</hi> death;
whom he received gently, and came to a Town
called <hi>Arnas:</hi> Thither came <hi>Craterus</hi> and <hi>Erigonus,</hi>
bringing with them <hi>Phradates,</hi> that had the rule
of the <hi>Tapurians;</hi> his friendly receiving and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
entertainment, was cauſe that many followed
his example, in committing themſelves to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
Mercy. <hi>Menape</hi> was there made Prince of
<hi>Hircania,</hi> who being a baniſhed man in the time of
<hi>Occhus,</hi> came to King <hi>Philip</hi> for Refuge: and
<hi>Phradates</hi> alſo was reſtored to the Office he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> was come to the uttermoſt
bounds of <hi>Hircania, Artabaſus,</hi> whom as we decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
did ſhew himſelf always faithful to his Maſter,
did meet him with <hi>Darius</hi> Kinſmen and Children,
and with a ſmall Band of <hi>Greek</hi> Souldiers. The
King at his coming proffered him his hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had been entertained before by King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi>
when he was baniſhed by <hi>Occhus.</hi> But the
chief cauſe that he received him ſo well, was for
the fidelity that he obſerved towards his Prince.
He being thus gently entertained by <hi>Alexander,</hi> did
ſay unto him; <hi>Sir, long may you flouriſh and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:46658:125"/>
reign in perpetual felicity: I that rejoyce in all other
things, am grieved only at this, that by reaſon of
mine old age, I ſhall not be able long to enjoy your
goodneſs.</hi> He was eighty five years of age, and
brought with him nine Sons born of one Mother,
whom he preſented to the King; praying God to
continue their lives, ſo long as their ſervice might
be acceptable unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> was accuſtomed much to walk on foot;
but then leſt the old man might be aſhamed to
ride, himſelf going on foot, he called for Horſes
for them both. When he was incamped, he ſent
for the <hi>Greeks</hi> that <hi>Artabaſus</hi> brought; but they
made requeſt, that he would firſt give aſſurance
to the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> that were amongſt them,
or elſe they would take advice amongſt themſelves
what were beſt to do: The ſame were the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours
that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had ſent to <hi>Darius,</hi>
which after the Battel, joyned themſelves to the
<hi>Greeks</hi> that were in pay with <hi>Darius.</hi> The King
willed them to leave all aſſurances and compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and come to receive ſuch appointment as
he would give them: They ſtood long in a doubt,
va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ying in opinions; but at length they agreed ſo
to do, ſaving <hi>Democrates</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
oppoſed the ſucceſs of the <hi>Macedons,</hi> and
deſpairing of pardon ſlew himſelf: But the other,
as they had determined, ſubmitted themſelves to
<hi>Alexanders</hi> will, being ten thouſand five hundred
in number, beſides ninety of ſuch as were ſent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours
unto <hi>Darius.</hi> The greateſt part of the
Souldiers were diſtributed amongſt the Bands, to fill
up the numbers that wanted; and the reſt were
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:46658:125"/>
ſent home, except the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> whom he
commanded to be put in priſon.</p>
            <p>There was a Nation called <hi>Mardons,</hi> bounding
next to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, rude in their manners and uſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
accuſtomed to live by theft: They neither
ſent Embaſſadours, nor gave any ſignification that
they would be at <hi>Alexanders</hi> Commandment: He
took thereat great indignation, that any one peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſhould give impediment to his Victory; and
therefore leaving a Guard for his Carriages, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
againſt them with a ſtrong power. He
marched forwards in the night; and by the time
that the day appeared, his Enemies were in ſight.
But the matter came rather to an Alarm, then to
any fight; for the Enemies were ſoon driven from
the Hills, who flying away, left their Villages to be
ſacked by the <hi>Macedons:</hi> But the Army could not
paſs into the inward parts of the Country without
great trouble and v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>xation, the ſame being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
about with high Mountains, great Woods,
and deſart Rocks; and the parts which were plain,
were defended with a ſtrange kinde of fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that is to ſay, with Trees ſet thick of purpoſe;
the Boughs whereof, when they were young, were
wreathed one within another, the tops bowed
down were put into the ground again, from whence,
as out of another root, there ſprung new branches.
They would not ſuffer the ſame to grow as Nature
brought them forth, but did knit them ſo one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
another, that when they were full of leaves they
covered the earth. The Trees thus wreathed one
within another, incloſed in the Country, as it were,
with a continual hedge, and were as ſnares to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:46658:126"/>
ſuch as would enter. There was no way
could be deviſed to go through the ſame, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by cutting down the wood; and therein they
found a great difficulty, and much travel, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that the wreathing and wrapping of the Boughs
kept them off from the bodies of the Trees; and the
weakneſs of the Boughs ſo yeilded to the ſtrokes,
that they could not eaſily be cut aſunder.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of the Country were accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to creep amongſt the under-wood like wilde
Beaſts, and by privy Sallies break out upon their
Enemies. <hi>Alexander</hi> therefore cauſed his men, after
the manner of Hunters, to ſeek out their lurking
places, and killed many of them. But at length
he invironed the Wood with his Souldiers round
about, to the intent they might break in at every
place, where they ſhould finde an entry: In doing
whereof, many wandred and loſt their company in
places that they knew not, and were taken priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and amongſt them <hi>Bucephalus, Alexanders</hi>
Horſe, whom he did not eſteem as other men do
other Beaſts; for this Horſe would not ſuffer any
other man to back him: and when the King would
ride, he would kneel down upon his knees to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him; ſo that he ſeemed to have the ſenſe to
underſtand whom he carried. <hi>Alexander</hi> was more
ſorrowful and incenſed fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s of his Horſe,
then was expedient for ſuch a cauſe: for ſearching
about to get the Horſe again, he cauſed Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be made by an Interpreter, that except he
were reſtored, he would not leave one of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men
alive. When they heard this terrible
threatning, amongſt other gifts, they preſented
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:46658:126"/>
unto <hi>Alexander</hi> his Horſe: Yet he was not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
pacified, but commanded the Woods to be
cut down, and the ways to be levelled which he cut
through the Woods. This work went ſo well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
that the Inhabitants deſpairing of ability to
defend their Country, yeilded themſelves to the
King, who receiving their Pledges, committed
them to the keeping of <hi>Phradates,</hi> and from thence,
the fifth day, he returned again to his Camp. There
he gave to <hi>Artabaſus</hi> the double honour that <hi>Darius</hi>
did unto him, and ſent him home again into his
Country.</p>
            <p>After that he came to the City of <hi>Hircania,</hi>
where <hi>Darius</hi> Chief Seat was; <hi>Nabarzanes:</hi> upon
aſſurance, came thither, bringing with him great
gifts; and amongſt the reſt, preſented unto <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
an Eunuch called <hi>Bagoas,</hi> of ſingular Beauty,
being in the firſt flower of his Youth, whom <hi>Darius</hi>
uſed, and afterwards <hi>Alexander;</hi> at whoſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
eſpecially he did pardon <hi>Nabarzanes.</hi> The
Nation of the <hi>Amazons</hi> being near unto <hi>Hircania</hi>
(as hath been ſaid before) did inhabit the Plains
of <hi>Themyſcire,</hi> about the River of <hi>Thermodoon,</hi> and
had a Queen reigning over them, called <hi>Thaleſtris,</hi>
which kept under her Dominion all the Countries
between Mount <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> and the River of <hi>Phaſis:</hi>
She for the great affection ſhe had to ſee <hi>Alexander,</hi>
travelled out of her own Country; and being
come near where he was, ſent certain before, to
declare that a Queen was come of deſire to viſit
him, and to enjoy the private familiarity of his
company. When liberty was given her to come to
his preſence, ſhe cauſed all the reſt of her Band to
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:46658:127"/>
ſtay, and ſhe came forwards, attended only by
three hundred women. As ſoon as ſhe perceived
<hi>Alexander,</hi> ſhe leaped from her Horſe, carrying
two Javelins in her hand. The <hi>Amazons</hi> apparel
is ſuch, that it doth not cover all their bodies; for
their breaſts are bare on the left ſide, and their
garments, which they uſe to knit up with a knot,
come not to their knees: One Breaſt they always
reſerve untouched, wherewith they nouriſh their
Women-Children; but their right Breaſts they uſe
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ear, to make them more apt to draw their

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and caſt their Darts. <hi>Thaleſtris</hi> looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Alexander</hi> with a bold countenance; and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in her beholding of him, that his perſonage an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
not to the Fame that ſhe had heard of his
Acts; for the Barbarous Nations gave great Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to the Majeſty of the Perſonage, thinking
none to be ſufficient for the doing of great Acts, but
ſuch as Nature had indued with great perſonages:
It was demanded of her, if ſhe had any requeſt to
make unto <hi>Alexander:</hi> Whereat ſhe abaſhed not
to confeſs, that ſhe was come thither to have Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
by him, thinking her ſelf a perſonage wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of whom he ſhould get Heirs to inherit his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
wherein ſhe covenanted, that if it were a
Woman, ſhe would keep it ſtill; and if it were a
Man-Childe, ſhe would reſtore it to the Father. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
enquired of her, if ſhe would go forwards
with him in his Wars: But therein ſhe excuſed her
ſelf, that ſhe had left no order for the defence of
her Kingdom. But ſhe continued ſtill in declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the cauſe of her coming, and required that
her expectation therein might not be in vain. The
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:46658:127"/>
Womans Appetite ſeemed to be more vehemently
given to Luſt then the Kings was; yet ſhe obtained
of him to ſtay for that cauſe, and he conſumed thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
days in ſatisfying her deſire.</p>
            <p>That done, ſhe departed to her own Kingdom,
and <hi>Alexander</hi> marched into <hi>Parthenia,</hi> which was
the place where he firſt ſhewed manifeſtly the Vices
that were in him. There he turned his Continency
and Moderation, being the moſt excellent Vertues
appearing in any kinde of Eſtate, into Pride and
Voluptuouſneſs; not eſteeming his Country-Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms,
nor the wholeſome temper that was in the
Diſcipline of the Kings of <hi>Macedon:</hi> For he judged
their civil uſage and manner to be over-baſe for his
greatneſs; but did counterfeit the height and pomp
of the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> repreſenting the greatneſs
of the gods. He was content to ſuffer men there
to fall down flat upon the ground, and worſhip him;
and accuſtomed the Conquerours of ſo many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
by little and little, to ſervile offices, coveting
to make them like unto his Captives. He ware up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Head a Diadem of Purple, interp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d,
for the Conquerour to change his Habit into the
faſhion of him whom he had vanquiſhed: And
though he boaſted that he wore the ſpoils of his
Enemies, yet with thoſe ſpoils he put upon him
their evil manners, and the inſolency of the minde
followed the pride of the Apparel. Beſides, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he ſealed ſuch Letters as he ſent into <hi>Europe</hi>
with his accuſtomed Seal; yet all the Letters he ſent
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:46658:128"/>
abroad into <hi>Aſia</hi> were ſealed with <hi>Darius</hi> Ring: So
it appeared, that one minde could not bear the
greatneſs that appertained to two. He apparelled
alſo his Friends, his Captains, and his Horſemen in
<hi>Perſian</hi> apparel; whereat though they grudged in
their mindes, yet they durſt not refuſe it for fear of
his diſpleaſure. His Court was repleniſhed with
Concubines; for he ſtill maintained three hundred
and ſixty that belonged to <hi>Darius;</hi> and amongſt
them were Flocks of Eunuchs, accuſtomed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the natural uſe of Women.</p>
            <p>The old Souldiers of <hi>Philip</hi> naturally abhorring
ſuch things, manifeſtly withſtood to be infected
with ſuch volup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uouſneſs and ſtrange Cuſtomes:
Whereupon there roſe a general talk and opinion
throughout the Camp, that they had loſt more by
the Victory, then they had won by the War: For
when they ſaw themſelves overcome with ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
and Forreign Cuſtoms ſo to prevail amongſt
them, they judged it a ſlender reward of their
long being abroad, to return home in the habit of
Priſoners. They began to be aſhamed of their
King, that was more like to ſuch as were ſubdued,
then to them that were Victorious; and that the
King of <hi>Macedon</hi> was become the Prince of <hi>Perſia,</hi>
and one of <hi>Darius</hi> Courtiers. When he underſtood
that the chief of his friends, and his men of War
were much offended at his doings, he went about
to recover favour again with gifts and liberality;
but the rewards of ſervitude are ungrateful to free
men: And therefore leſt it might turn into a ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he thought good to break the maginations
increaſed by idleneſs, with the exerciſe of War,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:46658:128"/>
whereof an apt occaſion was given: <hi>Beſſus</hi> inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf as a King, took upon him the name
of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> drawing to his part the <hi>Scythians,</hi>
and others that were the Inhabitants of the River
<hi>Thanais;</hi> which things were reported to him by
<hi>Nabarzanes,</hi> whom he had received into his favour,
and given the Rule of the Country he had before.
When he had determined this new Expedition, he
found his Army ſo over-charged and laden with
Spoil, and other Furniments of Voluptuouſneſs,
that they could ſcarcely move: Wherefore he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Baggage and Stuff of the whole Army
to be brought together into one place, excepting
only ſuch things as were very neceſſary: The
place was large and plain to which the Carts were
brought laden; and when every one ſtood waiting
and muſing what he would command them to do,
he cauſed the Beaſts to be removed firſt out of the
way, and then ſet his own Fardels on fire, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
all the reſt. Whileſt theſe things were burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Owners were on fire themſelves to ſee
them ſo conſumed; for the ſaving of which, they
had often quenched the flames in the Cities of their
Enemies: Yet no man durſt lament the price of his
own blood, ſeeing they ſaw the fire conſume the
Kings Riches as well as their own; and the rather
to pacifie them, the King did mitigate their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
with a brief Oration. Whereupon they that
were ever apt for the Wars, and ready to do all
things, began to be joyful, that with the loſs of
their Baggage, they had preſerved their Diſcipline
accuſtomed in the Wars. As they were ſetting for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
towards <hi>Bactria, Nicanor,</hi> the Son of <hi>Parmenio,</hi>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:46658:129"/>
died ſuddenly, whom every man greatly lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but chiefly the King, who deſired to have
ſtayed to celebrate his Funeral, but that want of
Victuals cauſed him to haſte forward: <hi>Philotas</hi>
therefore was left behinde with two thouſand ſix
hundred Souldiers, to perform the Ceremonies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining
to his Brothers Funeral, and <hi>Alexander</hi>
himſelf marched towards <hi>Beſſus.</hi> In the way, Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were brought to <hi>Alexander</hi> from the Princes
thereabout, that <hi>Beſſus</hi> was coming towards him
with a great Army; adding thereunto, that <hi>Satri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barzanes,</hi>
whom he had made Prince of the <hi>Arrians,</hi>
was newly rebelled; for that cauſe (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he was come near unto <hi>Beſſus</hi>) he thought it beſt
firſt to oppreſs <hi>Satribarzanes:</hi> and for that intent,
he brought forwards his Horſemen and Footmen
that were light armed, to invade him ſuddenly.
His coming was not ſo privy, but <hi>Satribarzanes</hi>
knew thereof, and fled into <hi>Bactria</hi> with two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Horſemen: for by reaſon he was not able to
aſſemble any more in ſo ſhort a time, the reſt took
the next Mountains for their refuge.</p>
            <p>There was a Rock, which towards the <hi>Weſt,</hi> was
high and ſteep, but towards the <hi>Eaſt</hi> more low, and
eaſie to be climbed, which part was full of Trees:
The ſame Rock being in compaſs two and thirty
furlongs, had a Fountain running continually<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
in the top a Green Plain, where they placed the
weaker multitude; but the reſt that were apt for
defence, being to the number of thirteen thouſand,
got themſelves to the edges of the Rock, and there
threw down ſtones and logs upon the <hi>Macedons</hi>
that came to aſſail them. He left <hi>Craterus</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:46658:129"/>
the Rock, and went in perſon to purſue <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribarzanes;</hi>
and becauſe he underſtood that he
was fled far off, he returned back again to the ſiege
of them that were upon the Rock. Firſt, he cauſed
all things to be taken away, that might be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
to his men in the aſſault giving: But
when they came to the bare and ſteep Rock, the
labour ſeemed loſt, where Nature wrought againſt
them. But he, that was of a diſpoſition always to
ſtrive againſt difficulties, conſidering how hard a
matter it was to go forward, and how dangerous
to return back, did caſt in his head all the ways
that could be imagined, and now fancied one
thing, and then another, as men are wont when
the ways they have found out firſt do not pleaſe
them. As he ſtood in a doubt what to do, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
did miniſter unto him a means, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wit nor reaſon could invent: It chanced that
the winde blew vehemently at the <hi>South Weſt,</hi> at
what time the Souldiers had felled great plenty of
wood, whereof they thought to have made Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds
to mount up againſt the Rock, and the heat
of the Sun had made the ſame dry. When <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
perceived the winde to blow ſo violently, and
the wood lying in that place, he immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
more Trees to be cut down, and laid upon
them, putting all other things to it that were apt
to kindle and nouriſh fire; ſo that Trees heaped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Trees, became as a Mountain ſo high as the top
of the Rock: The ſame being ſet on fire in all
parts at once, the winde carried the flame into the
faces of their Enemies, and the ſmoak covered the
Sky. The noiſe was then great that the fire made,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:46658:130"/>
which burned not only the Trees that were fired of
purpoſe, but alſo the reſt of the Wood growing
near thereabout.</p>
            <p>The Enemies were ſo tormented with the flame
and heat of the fire, that they were inforced to
forſake their place of ſtrength, and attempted to
eſcape away where the fire did give them leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment:
But where the fire gave place, the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedons</hi>
ſtood in a readineſs to receive them; ſo that
they were conſumed and ſlain divers kinde of ways:
Some threw themſelves down the Rocks, ſome ran
into the midſt of the fire, others fell into the hands
of their Enemies, and a few half conſumed with
fire, were taken priſoners. When <hi>Alexander</hi> had
done this, he returned to <hi>Craterus,</hi> who beſieged
<hi>Artacnan;</hi> and having prepared all things in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs,
tarried only for the Kings coming, to give
him the honour of winning the City.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> was come, he approached the
Walls with the Towers of Timber that he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for the aſſault; at the ſight whereof the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
were ſo afraid, that they held up their
hands from the Walls, requiring him to ſpare them,
and execute his wrath upon <hi>Satribarzanes,</hi> who was
the Author of their Rebellion. <hi>Alexander</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
them freely; and not only raiſed the Siege,
but alſo reſtored to the Inhabitants all things that
pertained to them. As he removed from this City,
there came to him a new ſupply of Souldiers:
<hi>Zoilus</hi> brought out of <hi>Greece</hi> five hundred Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and three thouſand <hi>Antipater</hi> ſent out of <hi>Illy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria:</hi>
There came a hundred and thirty <hi>Theſſalian</hi>
Horſemen with <hi>Philip,</hi> who alſo brought Forreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:46658:130"/>
out of <hi>Licia,</hi> two thouſand five hundred Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and three hundred Horſemen. <hi>Alexander</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thus increaſed his power, entred into the
Country of the <hi>Dragans,</hi> who were a warlike Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
under the Government of <hi>Nabarzanes,</hi> who
was of Counſel with <hi>Beſſus</hi> in the Treaſon that
he committed againſt his Prince. When he heard
of <hi>Alexanders</hi> coming, for fear of the puniſhment
he had deſerved, he fled into <hi>India.</hi> Here had
they lain incamped nine days, when <hi>Alexander</hi>
being without fear of any Enemy, and invincible
againſt all Forreign Powers, was brought in peril
by reaſon of his own people: It chanced that one
<hi>Dimnus,</hi> a man of mean behaviour and Authority
with his Prince, was greatly inflamed with the
love of a young man, called <hi>Nichomachus,</hi> with
whom he uſed much familiar converſation. This
<hi>Dimnus</hi> on a time being in a paſſion (as it well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
by his countenance) allured this young man
into a Temple, where remaining together, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
that he had certain Secrets to ſhew him,
which in no wiſe were to be reported again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Thereby he brought <hi>Nichomachus</hi> into a great ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
what the matter ſhould be; for before he would
tell him, he made a Proteſtation by the love and
familiarity betwixt them, that he would aſſure him
by his Oath to keep the thing ſecret; who ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the matter to be of no ſuch weight, that he
ought with Perjury, or breaking of his Oath, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe
the ſame again, did ſwear by the gods there
preſent. Then <hi>Dimnus</hi> opened unto him, how
there was a Treaſon conſpired againſt the King,
which within three days ſhould be put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:46658:131"/>
to which (he ſaid) he himſelf was private,
with divers men of Nobility and Eſtimation. When
<hi>Nichomachus</hi> did hear it, and found it to be of ſuch
moment, he conſtantly denied then that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
extended to conceal Treaſon, whereunto no
Oath nor Religion could binde a man; which when
<hi>Dimnus</hi> obſerved, he became on a rage betwixt
love and fear, and claſped the young man by the
hand, requiring with weeping eyes, that he would
not ſtick to be a partaker of this Conſpiracy; or at
the leaſt, if his heart would not ſerve him, that he
would keep the counſel ſecret, in reſpect that he
had found ſuch a manifeſtation of love in him, as
to commit his life into his hands, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proof of his fidelity. But in concluſion, when
he perceived that <hi>Nichomachus</hi> would in no wiſe
agree to his purpoſe, but manifeſtly abhorred the
act, he uſed divers means to draw him to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
one while intreating him with fair words,
and another while threatning to kill him, calling
him Coward, and Traytor to his Friend, commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Gallantneſs of the Enterpriſe, and put him
in hope of great preferment, that he ſhould be
partaker of the Kingdom which they went about
to purchaſe. When he had proved all theſe ways,
and yet he found him averſe, one while he thruſt
his Sword to <hi>Nichomachus</hi> throat, and another
while to his own; ſo that at length, by threatning,
and fair ſpeaking, he brought him to promiſe, both
to keep his counſel ſecret, and alſo to be aſſiſtant
to the deed. Yet nevertheleſs, as one of a conſtant
minde (though for the time preſent he ſeemed to be
won with the love of his Friend, and agreeable to
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:46658:131"/>
his requeſts) he changed no part of his former
purpoſe. This done, <hi>Nichomachus</hi> required to
know what the men were that had confederated
themſelves in ſo weighty a matter, becauſe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
(he ſaid) were much material that ſhould take
ſo great an Enterprize in hand.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Dimnus,</hi> though he were in great trouble
of minde that he had brought the matter ſo far
forth; yet when he heard him ask the queſtion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced,
and thanked him greatly, that he would
ſo freely aſſociate himſelf with ſuch manner of men,
as <hi>Demetrius</hi> of the Privy Chamber, <hi>Peculaus, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canor,
Aphabetus, Loceus, Dioc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nus, Archipolis,</hi> and
<hi>Aminuas.</hi> This communication once ended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, <hi>Nichomachus</hi> departed, and diſcloſed
all which he had heard before, to a Brother of his,
called <hi>Ceballinus,</hi> agreeing betwixt them two, that
<hi>Nichomachus</hi> ſhould remain ſtill ſecret in his Tent,
leſt by his coming to the Kings lodging, not uſing
to have acceſs to the King, the Conſpirators might
perceive themſelves betrayed. <hi>Ceballinus</hi> repaired
to the Kings lodging, tarrying before the gate,
waiting for ſome man near about the King to bring
him to his Preſence. It fortuned, that among many
which paſſed by, only <hi>Philotas,</hi> the Son of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menio,</hi>
demanded why he waited there? To whom
<hi>Ceballinus,</hi> with a baſhful countenance, (well decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the unquietneſs of his minde) reported all
which he had heard of his Brother, requiring that
he would declare the ſame immediately to the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Philotas</hi> departed from him unto the King, with
whom that day he had much communication on
other things, and yet opened no part of that which
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:46658:132"/>
was told him by <hi>Ceballinus.</hi> At night, as <hi>Philotas</hi>
came forth, <hi>Ceballinus</hi> met him at the Court-gate,
and required whether he had done his Meſſage to
the King or not: He excuſed the matter, that he
could not finde him at leiſure. The next day <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballinus</hi>
met him again going to the King, and
put him in remembrance of that he had told him
before; to whom he anſwered, <hi>that he remembred
it well, yet for all that he diſcloſed no part of it unto
the King. Ceballinus</hi> then began to ſuſpect him,
and intended no longer to defer the thing, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
the ſame to <hi>Metron,</hi> Maſter of the Kings Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
who immediately conveyed <hi>Ceballinus</hi> into
the Armory, and repaired ſtreight to the King, who
was bathing, and informed him of all that he had
heard.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> then made no delay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſent certain
of his Guard to take <hi>Dimnus,</hi> and after came him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
into the Armory. As ſoon as <hi>Ceballinus</hi> ſaw
the King, he ran unto him with great rejoycing,
and ſaid; <hi>Lo, I have preſerved thee from the hands of
thine Enemies. Alexander</hi> examined him of all the
circumſtances, and he again anſwered to every
point in order. The King was earneſt to know
how long it was ſince <hi>Nichomachus</hi> had given him
this information, and he confeſſed, that it was three
days. Whereupon the King conſidering, that in
truth he could not have concealed it ſo long, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that he ſhould be put in Ward. Then cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he out, and declared, that at the ſame inſtant
when he knew of the Conſpiracy firſt, he opened it
to <hi>Philotas,</hi> of whom (he ſaid) he might enquire
the truth. Thereupon it was demanded of him,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:46658:132"/>
whether he had required of <hi>Philotas</hi> to bring him
to the Kings Preſence, or not. Which thing when
the King by his confeſſion perceived to be true, and
that he did ſtifly maintain what he ſaid, he lifted up
his hands to heaven, the tears falling from his
eyes, greatly complaining, that <hi>Philotas</hi> ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
him with ſuch unfaithfulneſs, whom he moſt
of all truſted. <hi>Dimnus,</hi> in the mean ſeaſon, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for what cauſe he was ſent for, wounded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to death: but yet ſomewhat hindred by them
that were ſent to take him, he was brought alive
before the King, whom as ſoon as he beheld, he
ſaid unto him, Dimnus, <hi>What have I offended thee,
that thou ſhouldeſt think</hi> Philotas <hi>more worthy to be
King of</hi> Macedon <hi>then I?</hi> At which words <hi>Dimnus</hi>
became ſpeechleſs; and caſting forth a great ſigh,
turned his face from the Kings ſight, and fell down
dead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King called</hi> Philotas <hi>before him, and ſaid:</hi>
This man, whom thou here ſeeſt, ſhould have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
deat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, if it could have been proved that he
had concealed two days the Treaſon intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me, with which he hath charged thee, <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas;</hi>
to whom (<hi>as he ſaith</hi>) he gave knowledge imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
thereof: The more near thou art about me, ſo
much more greater is thy offence; and the fault had
been more tollerable in him, then in thee: Howbeit,
thou haſt a favourable Judge; for if there be any
thing that cannot be excuſed, yet at the leaſt it may
be pardoned.</p>
            <p>To this <hi>Philotas</hi> nothing abaſhed (if the heart
may be judged by the countenance) made anſwer,
<hi>That</hi> Ceballinus <hi>indeed brought him a vain Report,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:46658:133"/>
the Reporter whereof was over-light of credit to be
believed, and that he feared, leſt by the preſenting
of ſuch a matter which did riſe upon a Brabble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
two perſons of evil diſpoſition, he might him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
have been laught at to ſcorn: But afterwards,
when he once knew that</hi> Dimnus <hi>had ſlain himſelf, he
was clearly then reſolved no longer to have concealed
the thing.</hi> And ſo falling down before the King,
beſought him that he would rather have reſpect to
his life paſt, then to his fault, which was only a
concealment, and no act done. It is hard to ſay,
whether the King believed him, or grounded his
diſpleaſure more deeply in his heart: Nevertheleſs,
in token of pardon, he gave him his hand, ſaying,
<hi>how it appeared that the Accuſation was rather miſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credited
by him, then concealed of malice.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
he called his Councel together, amongſt
whom <hi>Philotas</hi> was not admitted, but <hi>Nichomachus</hi>
was brought in before them, where he declared all
ſuch matters as he before had ſhewed unto the King.
There was one <hi>Craterus,</hi> at that time in eſpecial fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
with <hi>Alexander,</hi> who for the envy he had to
<hi>Philotas</hi> advancement, did bear him always a
grudge: He knew very well that the King had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
been diſpleaſed with <hi>Philotas</hi> for the over-much
advancing of his good ſervice, and valiant Acts:
But yet for all that he was not ſuſpected of Treaſon,
but only noted of preſumption and arrogancy. <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus</hi>
thought that he could not have a better occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to oppreſs his Enemy, then by colouring his
private hatred with a pretence of duty towards his
Prince.</p>
            <p>I would to God (<hi>quoth he</hi>) you had taken our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:46658:133"/>
in the beginning of this buſineſs; for if you would
needs have pardoned him, you ſhould have kept from
him his knowledge how much he was in danger, rather
then have brought him in fear of his life; whereby you
ſhall make him more mindful of his own peril, then
of your goodneſs; for he may always imagine your
death, but you ſhall not be always in a condition to
pardon him. Let it never ſink into your heart, that
he who purpoſed ſo heinous a Treaſon, would change
his purpoſe for the indulgence of a Pardon. You know
well, that ſuch as offend are often in deſpair of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
and though he perchance, either with repentance
of his fault, or remembrance of your goodneſs, would
change his minde; yet I am ſure, that his Father <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menio,</hi>
Captain-General of ſo great an Army, and of
ſo grounded Authority amongſt your Souldiers (and
who is with them in manner as your ſelf) would be
ill content to be in your debt for his Sons life. There
are certain benefits hateful to men, and it is a ſhame
to confeſs to have deſerved death: Therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that he had rather it ſhould be thought you had
done him wrong, then that you had given him his
life. I cannot ſee therefore, but you ſhall be inforced
to deſtroy them for your own ſurety: There are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
enough remaining, yet unconquered, againſt whom
we are going; make your ſelf ſure from your Foes at
home, ſo ſhall ye have leſs need to fear your Enemies
abroad.</p>
            <p>Theſe were <hi>Craterus</hi> words; and the reſidue of
the Councel were of opinion, that <hi>Philotas</hi> would
never have concealed this Conſpiracy, except he
had been either Principal, or privy thereunto: For
they thought there was no true man, of honeſt
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:46658:134"/>
heart, though he had been none of the Kings Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars,
hearing ſo much as <hi>Philotas</hi> heard, but
would forthwith have opened the Conſpiracy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But
he being the Son of <hi>Parmenio,</hi> Maſter of the Kings
Horſe, and of his Privy Councel, did not ſo much
as a Stranger, who ſtraightway made relation of
what his Brother had told him. And whereas he
pretended, that the King was not at leiſure, they
judged it to be done, to the intent the Accuſer
ſhould not ſeek any other to whom he might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge
it; whereas <hi>Nichomachus,</hi> albeit he was
bound by his Oath to the contrary, yet would he
never reſt till he had diſcharged his Conſcience: But
<hi>Philotas,</hi> when he conſumed, in a manner, the whole
day in ſport and paſtime with the King, could not
finde in his heart to caſt forth a few words, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in a matter ſo much concerning the Kings
ſafeguard. But admit (quoth they) he had given
no credit to the matter through the lightneſs of the
Reporter, why ſhould he have deferred the Accuſer
two days, as though he had believed it? For if he
had miſliked the report, he might have diſmiſſed
the party. It was alſo alledged, that every mans
minde much miſgiveth him, when the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
his own jeopardy; much more ought men
to be credulous, when it toucheth the ſafety of a
Kings perſon, in which caſe it ought to be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
examined, though it be of ſmall moment: They
all therefore determined, that <hi>Philotas</hi> ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
to diſcloſe the Partners of this Conſpiracy.
The King commanding them to keep the matter
ſecret, departed; and to the intent no inkling
ſhould appear of this new Councel, he cauſed it to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:46658:134"/>
be proclaimed, that the Army ſhould be ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the next day. The ſame night the King call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Philotas</hi> to a Banquet, with whom he vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
not only to eat, but alſo familiarly to diſcourſe,
notwithſtanding he had before in the Councel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
his death. After the ſecond Watch of the
night, <hi>Epheſtion, Craterus,</hi> and <hi>Erigonus,</hi> who were
of the Kings Councel, came privily into the Court
without light; and of the Eſquires, there came
<hi>Perdicas</hi> and <hi>Leonatus,</hi> by whom Commandment
was given, that all ſuch as lay near the Kings lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſhould watch in Arms.</p>
            <p>By this time Souldiers were appointed to all the
Paſſage, and Horſemen were ſent to keep the ways,
that no man ſhould paſs privily to <hi>Parmenio,</hi> who
was then Governour of <hi>Media,</hi> and had under him
a great power. Then <hi>Artaras</hi> came into the Court
with three hundred armed men, unto whom there
were appointed ten of thoſe that had the charge
of the Kings Perſon, every one of them accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with ten Eſquires, who were forced into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
companies to take the other Conſpirators: But
<hi>Artaras,</hi> with his three hundred, was ſent to <hi>Philotas</hi>
lodging, where with fifty of the moſt reſolute, he
brake up his Chamber-door that was ſhut againſt
them; the reſidue were commanded to beſet the
houſe, leſt he might eſcape by ſome ſecret way.
<hi>Philotas,</hi> whether it were through the ſurety of his
own Conſcience, or through wearineſs of the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
of his minde, was in ſo profound a ſleep, that
<hi>Artaras</hi> brake in upon him before he waked. But
at length, when he was rouzed, and come to himſelf,
perceiving they went about to binde him, he cryed
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:46658:135"/>
out, and ſaid; <hi>Oh</hi> Alexander, <hi>the malice of mine E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
hath prevailed above thy Mercy.</hi> Speaking
theſe words, they covered his face, and brought
him into the Court. The next day the King gave
Commandment, that certain of the Men of War
ſhould aſſemble in Arms, to the number of ſix
thouſand: Beſides theſe, there were a Rabble of the
Black Guard that filled the Court, who being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
together, the armed men compaſſed in
<hi>Philotas</hi> with their Band, to the intent he ſhould
not be eſpied of the people, until ſuch time as the
King might ſpeak unto them: for by an old Law of
the <hi>Macedons,</hi> Kings in their own perſons were
wont to enquire in matters of Treaſon; yet could
not the Kings Authority prevail to Condemnation,
except it were confirmed by the conſent of the Men
of War: Therefore the Body of <hi>Dimnus</hi> was firſt
brought into the place, the moſt part knowing not
what he had done, or by what chance he was flain.
Then came the King forth to ſpeak unto the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
who in his countenance declared the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of his heart; and the ſadneſs of ſuch as were
near about him, cauſed unto the reſt a great expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the event. He caſt his eyes down to the
earth, and in a muſe, but at length he plucked up his
ſpirits, and ſpake unto them in this wiſe:</p>
            <p>By the Treaſon of ſome Aſſaſſinates I was almoſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from you; but through the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rcy and Providence
of the gods, I am yet preſerved. Your Honourable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
doth conſtrain me more vehemently to be moved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe Traytors, becauſe the only comfort and fruit
of my life is, that I remain to give thanks unto ſo
many Noble men, unto whom I am ſo much obliged.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:46658:135"/>
With ſpeaking of theſe words, the murmure of
the multitude did interrupt his ſpeech, and the
tears did fall from their eyes; then the King renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his diſcourſe:</p>
            <p>How much more will you be moved, when I ſhall
ſhew you the Authors of ſo horrible a Treaſon, which
I yet refrain, as one very loath to diſcover their names?
But I muſt uncover the memory of my former favours,
and utter the Conſpiracy of my unnatural Subjects;
for how is it poſſible for me to hide ſo great a Treaſon?
<hi>Parmenio,</hi> a man of that Age, ſo deeply in my debt,
through the moſt ample benefits both of me and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and whom I moſt eſteemed of all my Friends, is
the Captain and Contriver of all this Miſchief: His
Miniſter <hi>Philotas,</hi> hath procured <hi>Peucolaus, Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
and this <hi>Dimnus,</hi> (whoſe Body you here ſee) with
other Partners of their wickedneſs, to my deſtruction.</p>
            <p>As he ſpake theſe words, there aroſe throughout
the multitude a great murmure and complaint, ſuch
as uſeth to be amongſt Men of War, when they are
moved with affection or diſpleaſure. With that,
<hi>Nichomachus, Metron,</hi> and <hi>Ceballinus</hi> were brought
forth, every one of them giving in Evidence of what
they had ſpoken before; yet it appeared not by any
mans information, that <hi>Philotas</hi> was privy to the
Conſpiracy. But at the laſt, when the noiſe was cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and the Witneſſes had ſaid what they could,
the King proceeded in this manner:</p>
            <p>Of what minde think you was this man, who hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the whole Report, could finde in his heart to conceal
the Treaſon, the truth whereof is well declared by the
death of <hi>Dimnus? Ceballinus</hi> that reported an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
tale, for the certain tryal thereof, was afraid of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:46658:136"/>
no torments; and never delayed any moment of time,
until he had diſcharged himſelf, in ſo much that he
brake into the place where I was bathing; but <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas</hi>
only feared nothing, believed nothing. O how great
a heart had this man, who having knowledge of the
danger of his King, did never change countenance, nor
take ſo much pains, as to hear out the information of
the Accuſer! But in this ſilence and concealment there
is Treaſon hidden, and the greedy deſire he had to
Reign, did drive him head-long to attempt this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.
His Father is Governour of <hi>Media,</hi> and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
ſuch a Command amongſt the Captains and Men of
War, through my Authority, that he hopeth after a
great deal more then he hath; and becauſe I am with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Children, he eſteemeth me not: But <hi>Philotas</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
I have Children, Friends, and Kinsfolk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
you: So long as you are in ſafety, I ſhall not
reckon my ſelf without Heirs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then did he receive a Letter that was intercepted,
which</hi> Parmenio <hi>had written to his Sons,</hi> Nicanor
<hi>and</hi> Philotas; <hi>wherein there appeared no great
proof of any great Treaſon intended. The Letter
was this:</hi> Firſt take good heed to your ſelves, and
then to thoſe that belong to you; ſo ſhall we bring to
paſs what we have purpoſed. <hi>Which Letter the King
inforced; ſaying,</hi> It was written after ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that if it came unto his Sons hands it might be
underſtood by them that knew the deſign; but if it were
taken by the way, it ſhould deceive them that knew it
not. <hi>Then proceded he.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now will <hi>Philotas</hi> perhaps ſay, that when <hi>Dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
named all that were partakers of his Conſpiracy,
he named not him. As for that, it is no proof of his
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:46658:136"/>
Innocency, but a token of his Power and Authority,
becauſe he was feared even of them that might bewray
him, who betraying themſelves, durſt not ſpeak of him:
But what manner of man he hath been, his life doth
ſhew: He was Fellow and Companion to <hi>Amintas</hi>
my Kinſman, who conſpired High-Treaſon againſt my
Perſon in <hi>Macedon:</hi> He gave <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is Siſter in Marriage
to <hi>Attalus,</hi> then whom I had never greater Enemy.
When by reaſon of old friendſhip and familiarity, I
wrote unto him of the Title given to me by the Oracle
of <hi>Jupiter Hammon,</hi> he did not ſtick to anſwer,
that he was very glad that I was admitted into the
number of the gods, howbeit very ſorry for thoſe that
ſhould live under ſuch a one as would exceed the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of man. Theſe were plain tokens that his heart
was turned from me, and that he deſpiſed my glory:
This I kept cloſe in my heart ſo long as I might; for
I thought my Bowels pulled from me, if I ſhould
render them contemptible for whom I had done ſo
much: But now it is not words that muſt be puniſhed,
for the raſhneſs of their Tongues is turned to Swords,
which (believe me) <hi>Philotas</hi> hath whetted to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction;
whom if I ſhould ſuffer to eſcape, alas, my
Souldiers, whither ſhould I go? To whom ſhould I
commit my perſon? He was the man that I made
General of my Cavalry, of the greateſt part of mine
Army, and the Chief of the moſt Noble of the Youth
thereof: To his truth and fidelity have I committed
my Safeguard, my Hope, and Victory: His Father did
I prefer unto the ſame Eſtate whereunto you have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
me: <hi>Media,</hi> then which there is not a richer
Country, with many thouſands of your Friends and
Companions, I have put under his Governance and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:46658:137"/>
Authority. Where I truſted of moſt Surety, there I
have found moſt danger: How much more happy had
I been to have died in Battel, and to have been ſlain
by mine Enemies, then to be thus betrayed by my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects?
For now being ſaved from the dangers which I
moſt feared, I have fallen into thoſe which I ought to
have leaſt doubted. You have been wont oftentimes to
warn me, that I ſhould regard my ſafety; it is you
that now may do that for me which you have counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
me unto: To your hands, and to your ſuccour do
I fly: I would not live, though I might, againſt your
wills; and though you would, yet can I not, except I
be delivered from mine Enemies.</p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>Philotas</hi> was brought forth in an old
garment, his hands bound behinde him: It well
appeared how much this miſerable ſight moved
them who late before envied him. The day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ſaw him General of the Horſe, they knew
that he was at Supper with the King, and ſuddenly
they ſaw him, both a priſoner bound like a Theif,
and alſo condemned to die: It cauſed pity in their
hearts, to conſider how <hi>Parmenio,</hi> ſo Noble a man,
ſo great a Captain, who late having loſt two Sons,
<hi>Hector</hi> and <hi>Nicanor,</hi> ſhould be put to anſwer for the
third, whom calamity had left alive. The multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
being thus inclined to pity, <hi>Amintas,</hi> one of
the Kings Officers, with a bitter invective, ſet
them all againſt the Priſoner.</p>
            <p>We are all (<hi>quoth he</hi>) betrayed to the Barbarous
Nations; not one of us ſhall return home unto his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
Wife, or Friends, but we ſhall be a maimed body
without a Head, without Honour, without Fame, and
in a ſtrange Country ſhall be made a Mocking-ſtock to
our Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:46658:137"/>
His words were nothing pleaſing to the King,
becauſe he put the Souldiers in remembrance of
their Wives and Country, whereby he thought they
would be the leſs willing to go forwards in his wars.
There was one <hi>Cenus,</hi> who though he had married
the Siſter of <hi>Philotas,</hi> yet did he more extremely
inveigh againſt him, then any other, calling him
<hi>Traytor to his King, his Country, and to the whole
Army:</hi> And thereupon took up a ſtone, that by
chance lay at his feet, to have caſt at <hi>Philotas;</hi>
which he did (as ſome thought) to the end he might
rid him from further torments: But the King kept
back his hand, and ſaid, <hi>that the Priſoner ſhould
have liberty to ſpeak for himſelf, and would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him to be condemned otherwiſe.</hi> Then <hi>Philotas</hi>
being admitted to ſpeak, were it through the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of his offence, or through the greatneſs of
his peril, as a man aſtonied, and beſides himſelf,
durſt neither look up, nor ſpeak, but burſt out into
tears; whereupon his heart fainted, and he ſwoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
down upon thoſe that led him: But afterwards,
when he had wiped his eyes, and by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
recovered his heart and tongue, he prepared to
ſpeak for himſelf. Then the King beheld him in
the face, and ſaid; <hi>The</hi> Macedons <hi>ſhall be thy Judges;
I would know therefore whether thou wilt ſpeak to
them in thy Country Language, or not?</hi> To whom
<hi>Philotas</hi> anſwered, <hi>There are divers Nations here
beſides the</hi> Macedons, <hi>who I truſt ſhall perceive my
words the better, if I ſpeak in the ſame tongue that
you have done, to the intent that it may be better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
by the generality of the people here preſent.</hi>
Then ſaid the King, <hi>Mark how this man hath his
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:46658:138"/>
Native Language in hatred; for there is none but he
that will diſdain to ſpeak it: But let him ſay what
he will, do you remember, that he not only diſdaineth
our Cuſtoms, but alſo our Language.</hi> And with that
word the King departed from the Aſſembly: Then
ſaid <hi>Philotas:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is eaſie for an Innocent to finde words to ſpeak;
but it is very hard for a man in miſery to keep a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
in his diſcourſe. Thus ſtanding betwixt a clear
Conſcience, and moſt unhappy Fortune, I know not
which way I ſhall ſatisfie my ſelf, and the time, both
together: For he that might beſt have judged my Cauſe
is gone: What the cauſe is he would not hear me, I
cannot well imagine; ſince upon the matter heard, it
lyeth only in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his hands, either to diſcharge me, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
me: For the matter not heard, he cannot acquit
me being abſent, ſince he condemned me when he was
here preſent. Howſoever, the defence of a Priſoner is
not only ſuperfluous, but alſo hateful, which ſeemeth
not to inform, but to reprove his Judge: Yet will I
not forſake my ſelf, nor ſo demean me, that I may
ſeem condemned by mine own default: I ſee not of
what Treaſon I ſhould be guilty: Amongſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators
no man named me; <hi>Nichomachus</hi> ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of me; <hi>Ceballinus</hi> could not tell more of me
then he heard: And yet doth the King believe, that
I ſhould be the Head of this Conſpiracy. Was it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
that <hi>Dimnus</hi> ſhould forget to name him that
was the Principal? Or is it likely that he would
have over-ſlipped me, when the Names of the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators
were demanded of him? He would rather have
named me falſly, to allure the young man the ſooner
to his Opinion: Yet when he told the matter privily
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:46658:138"/>
to <hi>Nichomachus,</hi> whom he verily believed would
have kept it ſecret, naming himſelf, and all the reſt,
of me only he made no mention: It cannot be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that he omitted me, becauſe he would have ſpared
me. I pray you (my Fellows) if no man had come
to me, nor given me knowledge of the matter, ſhould
I this day have been put to anſwer, when no man
could have accuſed me? But be it that <hi>Dimnus</hi> were
alive, and would ſpare me, what think you by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Would they detect themſelves, and forbear me?
Adverſity is malicious and ſpiteful; an Offender, when
he is puniſhed himſelf, uſeth not to keep ſilence to
ſpare another man: Commonly he that goeth to Death
will ſpare no man; nor will any ſpare him that is
ready to die: Will not ſo many guilty perſons, as are
put to torments, confeſs the truth?</p>
            <p>But now I muſt anſwer to the Crime of which I
ſtand accuſed, if indeed, there can be found any
Crime at all? Why did I conceal Treaſon? Why
did I hear it with a ſmall regard? This fault, if it
were a fault, thou haſt pardoned me (O <hi>Alexander</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>)
whatſoever thou art, by giving me thy hand, and
bidding me to Supper with thee: If thou didſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me, I am clear; if thou didſt forgive me, I am
acquitted: Stand at the leaſt to thy own judgment.
Alas, what have I done, ſince this laſt night I went
from your Table? What new report hath changed
your minde? I was in a ſound ſleep, when my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
by their binding, waked me, who was ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in mine own misfortune: Offenders cannot ſleep
through their inquiet Conſcience, and are ſtung
with ſecret torments, not only when their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
is intended, but alſo when it is performed.
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:46658:139"/>
But this quietneſs came unto me firſt through mine
own Innocency, and then by the Kings Pardon: I
feared not that others Cruelty ſhould take more place
then his Mercy. But that it may not repent them to
have believed me, you ſhall underſtand, that this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy
was firſt ſhewed me by a light Fellow, who
could not bring any Witneſſes or Warrant of his words;
which if I had diſcloſed, it would have put many men
to trouble. O unhappy that I am! I thought mine
ears had been ſeduced with the falling out of two
Buggerers; and I ſuſpected the truth of the party,
becauſe he did not utter the matter himſelf, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
his Brother to do it; I was in fear, that the one
ſhould have denied whatever the other affirmed; and
withal, ſhould have ſeemed to procure much trouble to
many of the Kings Friends: So that becauſe I would
have offended none, I have found ſome more deſirous to
procure my death, then to ſave my life: What hatred,
ſuppoſe ye, ſhould I have gotten, if I had accuſed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents?
But <hi>Dimnus</hi> ſlew himſelf; could I therefore
divine before, that he would ſo do? No ſurely, this his
death being that which only tryed the Accuſation true,
could not move me to utter it, being prevented by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>And if I had been a Conſpirator with <hi>Dimnus</hi> of
ſo great a Treaſon, is it likely that I would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
it, by the ſpace of two days, after it was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered?
As for <hi>Ceballinus,</hi> it had been an eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to have diſpatched him out of the way after the
thing diſcloſed; wherefore ſhould I have delayed the
matter? I entred into the Kings Chamber alone, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
my weapons about me; why deferred I my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe?
Durſt I not attempt it without <hi>Dimnus?</hi> But
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:46658:139"/>
perchance ye will ſay, Becauſe he was the chief Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirator:
How then ſtandeth it together, that I ſhould
be his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderling, who did covet to be King of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don?</hi>
Which of you all have I corrupted with Bribes?
What Captain, what Officer have I inclined to more
then another? It is laid to my charge, that I abhor the
ſpeaking of my Country Language, and that I diſdain
the manners of the <hi>Macedons.</hi> What? Do I deſpiſe
the Kingdom that I covet? Ye know that our Natural
Tongue, through our Converſation with other Nations,
is gone out of uſe; as well thoſe that be Conquerours,
as they that be ſubdued, muſt learn a new Language.
But ſurely theſe things make no more againſt me, then
did the Treaſon that <hi>Amintas,</hi> the Son of <hi>Perdicas,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
againſt the King; with him I had friendſhip;
I will not die, except ye will make it a thing unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to love the Kings Brother: But it was our duty to
honour a man called to that degree of Fortune; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you, am I guilty becauſe I could not gueſs before
that he would offend? Is the Law ſuch, that the
Friends of Offenders muſt ſuffer being Innocents? if
that be the reaſon, why live I ſo long? If it be no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
why am I condemned to die? But I am charged,
that I had pity of them that ſhould live under ſuch a
one as believed himſelf to be the Son of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> O
faith of friendſhip, and dangerous liberty of true coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel!
it was you that deceived me, it was you that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
me to hide that I thought: I confeſs I wrote ſo
to the King, but not of the King. I did it not for
ſpite, but for my duty ſake: I thought it more expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for <hi>Alexander</hi> to have acknowledged the Kindred
of <hi>Jupiter</hi> with ſilence, then to have made a report
thereof with Oſtentation. But becauſe the truth of gods
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:46658:140"/>
Oracle is certain, let god he witneſs in my cauſe. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
me in Priſon, till ye may know <hi>Jupiters</hi> anſwer
concerning this Conſpiracy; and in the mean ſeaſon, be
that hath vouchſafed our King to be his Son, will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
none of them that have conſpired againſt his Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring,
to be unknown: If you ſuppoſe torments more
then Oracles, I will not deſire to be ſaved from them
in tryal of truth. There is an old uſe, that ſuch as be
put to anſwer upon Life and Death, are accuſtomed to
bring their Parents and Kinſmen before you: Two
Brothers of late have I loſt; my Father I neither can
bring forth, nor dare I call for, becauſe he is accuſed
of this Treaſon with me. It is a ſmall thing for him
that is the Father of many Children, and having but
one Son left in whom to take pleaſure, not only to
loſe him, but alſo to loſe his own life with him:
Therefore my moſt dear Father, ſhalt thou die for me,
and with me: It is I that do take thy life from thee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
It is I that put a period to thy old days: Why didſt
thou beget me, unhappy Wretch, in hatred of the gods?
Was it to receive ſuch fruit from me as is prepared
for thee? I am in doubt, whether my Youth be more
unhappy, or thine Age: For I in the flower of my
years am plucked away, and the Executioner ſhall
bereave thee of thy life; which if Fortune would have
ſuffered to continue, yet Nature would have asked
it e're it had been long. The remembrance of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth put me in minde how loath and timerous
I ought to have been to the report of Informations:
For when my Father was advertiſed that <hi>Philip</hi> the
Phyſitian had prepared poyſon for <hi>Alexander,</hi> he wrote
a Letter, to warn the King, that he ſhould not receive
the Medicine which his Phyſitian had prepared: Was
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:46658:140"/>
my Father believed? Was his Letter of any Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
I my ſelf, when I have reported ſuch things as I
heard, how often have I been ſhaken off with a check
for my light belief? So that when we tell things, we
are hated; and when we hold our peace, we are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected?
What would you have us to do?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then one of the Company that ſtood by, cryed
out;</hi> That none ought to be Traytors to them by whom
they are intruſted.</p>
            <p>Thou ſayeſt well (<hi>quoth</hi> Philotas) whoſoever thou
art: And therefore, if I have committed Treaſon, I
require no reſpite of my pain. And here will I make
an end of ſpeaking, becauſe my laſt words ſeem tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
unto your ears.</p>
            <p>As he was ſpeaking theſe words, his Keepers led
him away. There was amongſt the Captains one
<hi>Belon,</hi> a hardy man, but one very rude, and void of
all civility; who being an old Souldier, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
from a low eſtate, to the degree of Captain:
This <hi>Belon,</hi> preſuming upon a fooliſh audacity,
(when all others had done) began to tell them, that
when divers had taken up their lodgings in the
Camp, how they were thruſt out by the ſervants
of <hi>Philotas,</hi> who would take his quarters where
other men were placed before; and how all the
Streets were full of his Waggons, laden with Gold
and Silver. He added further, that <hi>Philotas</hi> would

certain to wait whiles he ſlept, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
he ſhould not be diſquieted with any noiſe; not
ſo much for wakening of him, as for diſturbing his
reſt; and that he was ſo haughty, that he deſpiſed
the plain men of <hi>Phrygia</hi> and <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:46658:141"/>
a <hi>Macedon</hi> born, would not be aſhamed to hear
men of his own Nation by an Interpreter: And
whereas he had heretofore moved to have the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of <hi>Jupiter</hi> enquired after, he ſaid, it was meant
thereby to make <hi>Jupiter</hi> a lyer, for acknowledging
<hi>Alexander</hi> to be his Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if any man ſhould envy
the King for that Title which the gods had given
him: But why (ſaid he) did he not ask counſel at
<hi>Jupiter</hi> before he did offend? For now he would
have ſent to the Oracle, that in the mean ſeaſon his
Father, who ruleth in <hi>Media,</hi> might raiſe a power;
and with the money that he hath in cuſtody, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
deſperate perſons to the fellowſhip of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.
Nevertheleſs, we ſhall (ſaid he) ſend to <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
not to inquire of any thing touching the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but to give him thanks, and to ſacrifice unto
him for the preſervation of ſo good a King. Then
all the Company was moved, and among them there
began a cry, <hi>That the Traytor ſhould be rent in pieces;</hi>
which thing <hi>Philotas</hi> (who feared more grievous
puniſhment) was content to hear.</p>
            <p>The King returning, deferred the Councel till
the next day, either to commit <hi>Philotas</hi> to priſon,
to be there racked, or elſe, in the mean ſeaſon, to
get further knowledge of the Treaſon: yet albeit it
drew towards night, he commanded his Councel
to be called together.</p>
            <p>Some of them thought it beſt, that <hi>Philotas</hi> ſhould
be ſtoned to death, after the <hi>Macedons</hi> Laws: <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
Craterus,</hi> and <hi>Cenus,</hi> determined to have him
tryed by torment; and then they who perſwaded
the contrary, turned alſo to their Opinion: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when the Councel was broken up, <hi>Epheſtion,</hi>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:46658:141"/>
with <hi>Craterus</hi> and <hi>Cenus</hi> aroſe, to haſte <hi>Philotas</hi>
to the examination. The King called <hi>Craterus</hi> unto
him; and commanding the reſt to avoid, had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
communication with him in the innermoſt part
of his lodging, the effect whereof came not to any
mans knowledge. He tarried there till the night
was far paſt, to hear the end of the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
The Executioners ſet forth all ſorts of cruel tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the ſight of <hi>Philotas,</hi> who of his own
minde ſaid unto them:</p>
            <p>Why defer you to kill ſuch a man as hath confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
himſelf the Kings Enemy, and a Traytor? What
needeth more Examination? It was my intent, it was
my will.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Craterus</hi> minde was, that whatſoever was confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
before, ſhould be confeſſed by <hi>Philotas</hi> again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Rack. Whiles he was taken upon the Rack,
his Body naked, his Eyes bound, he cryed out upon
the Law of Nature, and the gods of the Country;
but all was in vain to their deaf ears. Finally, as a
condemned man, he was torn with moſt extreme
torments by his Enemies, for the Kings pleaſure:
And notwithſtanding both Fire and Scourges were
miniſtred unto him, more to afflict him, then to
examine him; yet he had power of himſelf, both to
refrain from ſpeaking and groaning. But...after
that his Body began to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> with ſtripes, and
that he could not abide the Scourges, which pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to the bare bones; he promiſed, if they would
torment him no more, he would confeſs whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they ſhould require of him: But firſt he would
have them to ſwear by the life of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that
they ſhould ceaſe their torments, and ſet the Rack
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:46658:142"/>
aſide. The which being obtained, he ſaid to <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus,
Tell me what ye will have me to confeſs:</hi>
Thereat <hi>Craterus</hi> was diſpleaſed, thinking by thoſe
words that he had mocked him; and cauſed his
torments to be renewed. Then <hi>Philotas</hi> beſought
him to have a time of reſpite, whiles he might take
his breath, and then he would utter all that ever he
knew. In the mean ſeaſon, the chief of the men at
Arms, and eſpecially ſuch as were near to <hi>Parmenio</hi>
in any degree of Kindred, after that the Fame was
ſpread that <hi>Philotas</hi> was tormented, fearing the
<hi>Macedons</hi> Law, (wherein it was ordained, that the
Kinſfolk of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuch as had committed Treaſon againſt
the King, ſhould be put to death with the Traytors)
ſome ſlew themſelves, ſome fled into wilde Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and waſte Wilderneſſes; and great dread and
fear fell through all the Hoſt, until ſuch time as the
King having knowledge of it, made Proclamation,
that he would pardon the rigour of the Law to the
Kinsfolk of the Traytors.</p>
            <p>In concluſion <hi>Philotas</hi> made his Confeſſion; but
whether it were to deliver himſelf out of pain, by
accuſing himſelf falſly, or not, it is to be doubted;
ſeeing that it is commonly ſeen, that both thoſe
that truly confeſs, and falſly deny, come all to one
end: <hi>You are not ignorant</hi> (quoth he) <hi>how fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
my Father was with</hi> Egi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ocus, <hi>I mean the ſame
that was ſlain in the Field; he was the cauſe of our
miſchief: For when the King took upon him the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of</hi> Jupiters <hi>Son, he diſdained thereat: Shall we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
him</hi> (quoth he) <hi>to be our King, who taketh
ſcorn that</hi> Philip <hi>was his Father? We are all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
if we can ſuffer this: He doth not only deſpiſe
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:46658:142"/>
men, but the gods alſo, who will be reputed a god.
We have loſt</hi> Alexander; <hi>we have loſt our King; he is
fallen to Preſumption, neither tolerable to the gods
with whom he compareth, neither to men whom he
deſpiſeth: Have we with our Blood made him a god
who now deſpiſeth us? who diſdaineth to be in the
number of men? Truſt me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we alſo, if we be
men, ſhall be adopted of the gods. Who hath reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the deaths of</hi> Alexander <hi>his Grand-father, or of</hi>
Archelaus, <hi>or</hi> Perdicas? <hi>But this man hath forgiven
them that ſlew his Father.</hi> Theſe were the words
that <hi>Egilocus</hi> ſpake about ſupper-time, and on the
morrow early my Father ſent for me: He himſelf
was heavy, and ſaw me alſo ſad, for we both had
heard that which made us out of quiet: Therefore
to prove whether he uttered theſe words through
exceſs of Wine, or premeditation, we thought good
to ſend for him; and ſeeking occaſion of the ſame
communication, he of his own minde ſaid fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<hi>That if we durſt undertake the Adventure; he
would not ſhrink from us; or if our hearts ſerved not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
he would keep our counſel:</hi> Yet ſo long as <hi>Darius</hi>
was living, my Father thought all the matter out of
ſeaſon, becauſe the death of <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould be
to the advantage of our Enemies, and not of our
ſelves: But <hi>Darius</hi> once rid out of the way, then
he that could deſtroy the King, ſhould obtain the
Empire of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and all the Orient for his reward:
Which counſel being approved, Faith and Troth
was given; but concerning <hi>Dimnus,</hi> I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>When he had confeſſed all this; <hi>I perceive</hi> (quoth
he) <hi>that it doth not avail me, that I am utterly
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:46658:143"/>
guiltleſs of this Treaſon.</hi> Then they renewed his
torments, and did beat his Face and his Eyes with
the Truncheons of their Spears, until they inforced
him, not only to betray himſelf, but alſo to ſhew
the circumſtance of the whole Treaſon pretended:
Becauſe (quoth he) it ſeemed that the King would
continue long among the <hi>Bactrians,</hi> I was afraid,
leſt my Father, that had ſo great a power in his
hands, and the keeping of ſo much Treaſure (being
fourſcore years of age) ſhould happen to die in the
mean ſeaſon; and then being diſarmed of ſo great
a ſtrength, I ſhould not get opportunity to ſlay the
King; wherefore I haſted the matter, whileſt the
prey was in hand. Thus diſcovered he the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,
whereof if they believed not his Father to
be Author (he ſaid) that for his tryal he not refuſed
to be tormented again, though it were too grievous
for him to endure. The Officers then whiſpering
together, thought the examination ſufficient, and
returned therewithal unto the King, who on the
morrow cauſed all the Confeſſion to be openly reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before <hi>Philotas,</hi> whom he cauſed to be led into
the place, becauſe he was not able to go; and there
he confeſſed all the Treaſon again: Then <hi>Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
was brought forth, who was counted the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Actor in this Conſpiracy, next to <hi>Philotas:</hi> But
he with great proteſtation, and incredible ſtoutneſs,
both of heart and countenance, denied that he ever
intended any evil againſt the King; and for his try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
deſired to be tormented.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Philotas</hi> caſting his eyes about, eſpied
one <hi>Calis</hi> ſtanding by, and made a ſigne to him to
draw near; who being abaſhed, and refuſing to
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:46658:143"/>
come forwards; <hi>Wilt thou</hi> (quoth he) <hi>ſuffer</hi> Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius
<hi>to lye, and me to be racked again?</hi> With thoſe
words <hi>Calis</hi> became ſpeechleſs, and changed co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.
Then the <hi>Macedons</hi> began to ſuſpect that he
would accuſe Innocents, becauſe the ſame <hi>Calis</hi> was
neither named by <hi>Nichomachus,</hi> nor by <hi>Philotas</hi>
himſelf in his torments. But finally, <hi>Philotas,</hi> before
the Kings Officers ſtanding thereabout, confeſſed,
that the Treaſon was conſpired by himſelf, and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius;</hi>
wherefore as many as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> impeached by
<hi>Nichomachus,</hi> upon a token given, were ſtoned to
death according to the <hi>Macedons</hi> Law.</p>
            <p>Thus was <hi>Alexander</hi> delivered from great peril,
not only of his ſafety, but alſo of his life: For
<hi>Parmenio</hi> and <hi>Philotas</hi> being of ſuch power, if they
had not openly been found culpable, could not
have been condemned without the grudge of the
Army. So long therefore as <hi>Philotas</hi> denied the
thing, the matter ſeemed doubtful, and many men
thought him cruelly handled: But after he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
the circumſtances, no man, not ſo much as
the neareſt Friends, took any pity of him.</p>

            <p>AS the Men of War thought <hi>Philotas</hi> juſtly
put to death, his offence being freſh in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory;
even ſo, after he was gone, their envy
was turned into pity: The Nobleneſs of the
Young Man moved them much; ſo did the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Old Years and Deſolation of his Father.
He was the firſt that made the way open for <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
into <hi>Aſia,</hi> always partaker of his perils, the
Captain of his Vaward, and chief in Councel with
the King his Father; and ſo truſty to <hi>Alexander</hi>
himſelf, that in oppreſſing of <hi>Attalus,</hi> his Enemy, he
would uſe no other mans ſervice. The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of theſe things was freſh among all the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and ſeditious words came to the Kings ears,
who being moved therewith, did wiſely with tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
avoid the evil occaſions coming of idleneſs:
wherefore he cauſed it to be proclaimed, that all
men ſhould be in a readineſs before the Court-gate,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:46658:144"/>
where they being once aſſembled, he came forth to
ſpeak unto them: And as it was before contrived,
he required the Band of the <hi>Agrians</hi> to bring forth
one <hi>Alexander Lynſtes,</hi> which long before <hi>Philotas</hi>
had conſpired the Kings Death. This man being
accuſed of two Witneſſes (as before ſaid) had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in priſon three years together; againſt
whom it was proved, that he was of counſel with
<hi>Pauſanias</hi> in the killing of King <hi>Philip:</hi> But becauſe
he ſaluted firſt <hi>Alexander</hi> by the Name of King, his
puniſhment was deferred, rather then his offence
forgiven: For at the interceſſion of <hi>Antipater,</hi> his
Father-in-law, the King had reſpited his juſt indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
for that time. But the old feſtered ſore brake
out again, and the conſideration of his peril preſent,
renewed the remembrance of his danger paſſed:
Therefore when he was brought forth of priſon,
and commanded to ſay for himſelf, albeit he had
three years leiſure to deviſe his anſwer, yet ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering
and trembling, could bring forth but little
of that which he purpoſed to ſay; and finally, both
his heart and his memory failed him: wherefore
there was none that doubted, but that his fearfulneſs
was a token of a guilty Conſcience, and no default
of memory: So that whilſt he was ſtaggering and
hacking in his tale, they that ſtood next thruſt him
through with their Pikes; whoſe body conveyed
out of the place, the King commanded <hi>Amintas</hi>
and <hi>Simmannas</hi> to be brought forth; for <hi>Palemon,</hi>
their youngeſt Brother, after he had knowledge of
<hi>Philotas</hi> torment, fled away. Of all <hi>Philotas</hi> friends,
theſe two were moſt dear to him, and through his
commendation, advanced to high and honourable
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:46658:145"/>
Offices: The King remembring with what earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and labour <hi>Philotas</hi> had brought them into his
favour, doubted not but they were privy to his laſt
Conſpiracy. Whereupon he declared unto the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
that he had occaſion of ſuſpition againſt
thoſe men long ago by his Mothers Letters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he had warning to beware of them; and that
now fearing the ſequel of worſer inconveniencies,
had made them ſure, inforced thereunto by appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
preſumptions. Firſt, he ſaid, the day before
<hi>Philotas</hi> Treaſon came to light, it was well known,
that they had much conference with him in ſecret:
And alſo their Brother, who fled away when <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas</hi>
was on the Rack, he had declared, by the abſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of himſelf, the cauſe of his flying. He ſhewed
alſo, that of late, contrary to their accuſtomed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of waiting, without any cauſe moving them
thereunto, but only by pretence of diligence, they
preſſed next about the King of all other; whereat
marvelling that they would furniſh a Room where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
they were not appointed, became ſo in doubt
of their cluſtring together, that he returned into the
Train of the Gentlemen that followed him: He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
beſide, that when <hi>Antiphanes,</hi> Clerk of the
Stable, the day before <hi>Philotas</hi> Treaſon came to
light, according to his accuſtomed manner, gave
knowledge to <hi>Amintas,</hi> that he ſhould deliver of his
Horſe to ſuch as had loſt their own; he proudly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
again, <hi>that except he would content himſelf, he
ſhould know ſhortly what manner of man he was:</hi>
Which violence of tongue, and raſhneſs of words
bulked out (quoth he) was nothing elſe, but a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and token of his trayterous heart. Theſe
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:46658:145"/>
things being true (he ſaid) they had no leſs deſerved
then <hi>Philotas;</hi> and if they were otherwiſe, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
they might anſwer unto the points: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Antiphanes</hi> was brought in to give Evidence of
the Horſe not delivered, and of his proud anſwer
given with threatning. When <hi>Amintas</hi> had gotten
liberty to ſpeak, he deſired of the King, that whiles

               </gap>y, and ſaid in this
wiſe:</p>
            <p>Whatſoever ſhall become of us (Sir King) we muſt
think if our chance be good, the ſame to proceed of
your favour; and if it be evil, we muſt judge the fault
to be in our Fortune, ſeeing you ſuffer us to plead our
cauſe without prejudice, ſetting our mindes free, and
our bodies at large, with the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>me apparel reſtoring
us, wherein we were wont to follow you: Our Cauſe
is ſuch, that we cannot doubt of it, and we are paſſed
the fear of Fortune; therefore, with your favour, I
will anſwer firſt thoſe points wherewith you charged us
laſt. We know moſt aſſuredly, that we be innocent of
any kinde of words ſpoken to the derogation of your
Majeſty; and durſt affirm, that you had over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ome all

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>enture you would think
that I went about with fair words to excuſe things
that have been maliciouſly ſpoken: Though it were ſo,
that words ſometime did eſcape us, either when we
were faint, or wearied in marching, hazarding our
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:46658:146"/>
ſelves in fighting; or elſe when we were ſick, or
dreſſing of our Wounds: Our honeſt doings otherwiſe
do deſerve, that ye ſhould rather impute the ſame to
the time, then to evil diſpoſition in us: For it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ſeen, where any thing chanceth amiſs, all men in
manner become guilty of the fault: We do violence
ſometime to our own bodies, which we hate not:
Yea, the coming of the Fathers unto the Children,
ſometime is both ungrateful, and alſo hateful. But
on the other ſide, when we receive rewards or gifts,
or when we come laden home with Spoil, Who can
then ſtay us? Who can reſtrain our chearfulneſs? or,
Who can reſiſt our courage in fighting? The Nature
of Man, is neither to keep meaſure in diſpleaſure, nor
in gladneſs. Thus are we driven by the violence of
affection, ſometimes with pity, and ſometimes with
fury, as our preſent deſire doth govern us. One
while we are in minde to paſs through <hi>India,</hi> as
far as the Ocean Sea; and by and by, the memory
of our Wives, and Children, and Country, altereth
our purpoſe: But as ſoon as the Trumpet ſoundeth,
ſtraight all theſe imaginations do paſs away, and
every man then runneth in his Array, revenging
upon their Enemies the diſpleaſures conceived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their own Tents. I would <hi>Philotas</hi> had offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but only in words; I would paſs over that, and
return to the other point whereof we are accuſed:
The friendſhip that was betwixt <hi>Philotas</hi> and us,
I will not only not deny, but alſo confeſs, that we did
covet the ſame, and received thereby great commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.
Do you marvel that we did honour and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
the Son of <hi>Parmenio,</hi> whom you did chuſe to
be next about your Perſon, and did advance above
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:46658:146"/>
all other your Friends? You your ſelf (if you pleaſe
to hear the truth) are the cauſe of this your peril.
What other thing moved us to covet <hi>Philotas</hi> Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
then that we deſired to pleaſe you? By this
preferment we are advanced unto your favour: He
ſtood in ſuch height with you, that it behoved us as
well to ſue for his benevolence, as to fear his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
Have not we ſworn that we would repute your
Enemies our Enemies, and honour your Friends as our
own? Should we have been found diſobedient in this
Bond of our Duty; and eſpecially towards him, whom
ye did prefer above all men? If this be a fault, ye
have few Innocents, or ſurely none at all: All men
deſired to be <hi>Philotas</hi> friends, but all that did covet
it could not be accepted. So if ye will make no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the Partners of his Treaſon, and
ſuch as were his Friends; then ſo many are Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
as would have been his Friends. What pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
have you now that we ſhould offend? I
think, becauſe yeſterday <hi>Philotas</hi> talked with us fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly
alone: Thereof I cannot excuſe my ſelf, if
yeſterday I changed any thing of mine accuſtomed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and living; but if ſo be we uſed every day to
do the like, then Cuſtom muſt needs make it to
be no Offence. But it may be ſaid, The Horſes were
not delivered to <hi>Antiphanes;</hi> and the day before
<hi>Philotas</hi> was detected, this difference was betwixt
<hi>Antiphanes</hi> and me: If that be a juſt cauſe of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition,
that I would not then deliver my Horſes, there
ſhall ariſe a doubtful Plea between the Denyer and
the Demander, ſaving that his Cauſe is better that
keepeth ſtill his own, then his that requireth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mans. I had ten Horſes, of the which <hi>Antiphanes</hi>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:46658:147"/>
had diſtributed eight to ſuch as had loſt their own;
ſo there only remained two, which when he would
proudly and wrongfully have taken away, I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
to keep them ſtill, except I would have ſerved
on foot. I cannot deny but that this communication was
had between a man of a free ſtomack, and a perſon
of a vile nature, which could do no manner of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
but take away mens Horſes, and give them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
What miſchief is this, that at one time I muſt
purge my ſelf both to the King, and to <hi>Antiphanes?</hi>
But to the other point, that your Mother did write to
you of us, as of your Enemies; I would to God ſhe
had more wiſely been careful of her Sons ſafeguard,
then doubtfully imagined ſuch inventions: Why doth
ſhe not alſo expreſs the cauſe of her fear? Beſides, ſhe
ſheweth not her Author, nor yet ſignifieth one word
whereby ſhe was moved to write to you ſuch Letters
of fear. O wretched eſtate of mine, which ſtandeth in
no leſs hazard to hold my peace, then to ſpeak! Yet
howſoever the event ſhall be, I had rather my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
ſhould diſpleaſe you, then my Cauſe. If you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
when you ſent me to fetch new Souldiers out
of <hi>Macedon,</hi> even when you ſhewed me, that in
your Mothers houſe there lurked many luſty young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen;
you commanded me, that in executing your
Commiſſion, I ſhould ſpare none, but bring with me
perforce all ſuch as refuſed the Wars: which thing I
did, and fulfilled your will therein, more largely then
was expedient for me; for I brought unto you <hi>Gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
Heccateus,</hi> and <hi>Gorgata,</hi> which now miniſter unto
you, and do very acceptable ſervice. What Creature
therefore is more wretched then I, who if I had not
fulfilled your will, ſhould rightfully have ſuffered; and
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:46658:147"/>
now I periſh, becauſe I obeyed you? For truly there
was no cauſe that moved your Mother to perſecute us,
then that we preferred your Command before a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
favour: I brought unto you of <hi>Macedons</hi> ſix
thouſand and eight hundred Horſemen, of the which
the greateſt part would not have followed me: It is
reaſon therefore, that in as much as your Mother is
diſpleaſed with us for your Cauſe, that ye mitigate
her in whoſe diſpleaſure you have put us.</p>
            <p>Whiles <hi>Amintas</hi> was thus pleading his Cauſe,
they that had purſued his Brother <hi>Palemon</hi> (of
whom we ſpake) came leading him bound into the
place. Then the rage of the people could ſcarcely
be pacified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as the manner was in ſuch caſes, they
would have ſtoned <hi>Palemon</hi> to death; yet he bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpake to them, and ſaid:</p>
            <p>I deſire no favour for my ſelf, ſo that my flying be
not hurtful to the Innocency of my Brethren, whom
if you cannot think clear, let the fault be laid to me:
For their Cauſe appeared the better, becauſe I which
fled away am ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he had ſpoken theſe words, the whole
Aſſembly were inclined to his favour, and diſſolved
to tears; being ſo ſuddenly and ſo contrary turned,
that now they we re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>all on his part, who a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were againſt him: He was in the prime flower
of his Youth, and through other mens fear fled
away amongſt thoſe Horſemen, who were amazed
at <hi>Philotas</hi> torments: His company had left him
behinde; and whiles he was in doubt whether he
might turn again, or fly further forwards, he was
taken by them which purſued after him. He then
began to weep, and beat himſelf about the face, not
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:46658:148"/>
ſo much lamenting his own chance, as the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Brethren, being in danger for his cauſe
with which behaviour of his, he moved the King
and all the company there preſent; only his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Amintas</hi> could not be pacified, but beheld him
with a fierce countenance, and ſaid:</p>

when thou didſt put thy Spurs to thy Horſe as a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to thy Brethren, and a Companion to Traytors.
Thou Wretch! whither, and from whence didſt thou
flee? Thou haſt now brought to paſs, that both I am

            <p>
               <hi>Palemon</hi> thereupon confeſſed himſelf to have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
in that point, but more grievouſly againſt
his Brethren, then towards himſelf. Then the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
could not abſtain from weeping and ſhout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
being Tokens whereby men in Aſſembly are
wont to declare their affections, and with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
they cryed to the King, <hi>That he ſhould ſpare In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents,
and men of ſervice.</hi> His friends, upon that
occaſion, did riſe, and with weeping eyes required
mercy of the King. Then he commanded ſilence,
and ſaid:</p>
            <p>By mine own judgment, I do pardon both you, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mintas,</hi>
and your Brethren, deſirous that ye ſhould
be more mindful of my benefit, then of your own jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardy:
Come in favour again with me, with that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
by which I am reconciled unto you. Except
theſe things which were brought in Evidence had been
tryed to the uttermoſt, my diſſimulation might have
been ſuſpected in this matter: Better it is therefore
to be cleared, then to remain in jealouſie, and thin
<pb facs="tcp:46658:148"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:46658:149"/>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:46658:149"/>
that no man can be acquitted, except he be firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected:
Thou <hi>Amintas,</hi> pardon thy Brother, and
let that be a token of thy hearts being reconciled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me.</p>
            <p>This done, the King diſmiſſed the Aſſembly, and
ſent for <hi>Polidamus,</hi> whom of all men <hi>Parmenio</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
beſt, accuſtomed always to ſtand next him in
Battel: And though the clearneſs of his conſcience
did aſſure him to come boldly; yet after he was
commanded to bring forth his Brethren, being but
young, and unknown to the King, his confidence
was turned into fear, and he began to doubt, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
in his minde rather ſuch things as might hurt
him, then by what means he was thus circumvent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
In the mean ſeaſon, the Guard which had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
thereunto, brought forth his Brethren.
When the King ſaw <hi>Polidamus</hi> pale for fear, he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him near unto him, and commanding all men

So that when <hi>Parmenio</hi> ſhall ſee both you, and the

            <p>
               <hi>Polidamus</hi> being thus delivered of fear, promiſed
his diligence a great deal more earneſtly then was
required. When <hi>Alexander</hi> ſaw his promptneſs in
the matter, he both commended his good will, and
rewarded him accordingly: And <hi>Polidamus</hi> chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
his own apparel, and took other, after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> with two of the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to be his Guides; for whoſe truth, their Wives
and Children were pledges in the mean ſeaſon:
And ſo they paſſed on Camels through ſuch places
as were deſart for lack of moiſture, and within ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
days came unto their journeys end, before any
knew of their coming. <hi>Polidamus</hi> then took again
his <hi>Macedons</hi> apparel, and in the dead time of the
night came unto <hi>Cleanders</hi> lodging, who had the
chief Authority there, next unto <hi>Parmenio.</hi> When
<hi>Cleander,</hi> by his Letters, underſtood the Kings plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<hi>Polidamus</hi> having more Letters to deliver like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to others, agreed by the break of day to go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to <hi>Parmenio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As they were going, tidings came to <hi>Parmenio</hi> of
<hi>Polidamus</hi> arrival, who rejoycing, both for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Friend, and for the deſire he had to know
of the Kings Eſtate (the rather, becauſe he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
no Letter from him a long ſpace) command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Polidamus</hi> to come to him. The houſes of that
Country have large Back-ſides, and pleaſant Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards
full of Trees, being the chief delight of the
Princes and great Lords there. The Captains which
had received Commandment by the Kings Letters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:46658:150"/>
to kill him, came to <hi>Parmenio,</hi> walking under the
ſhadow of the Trees, being agreed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to execute the ſlaughter, when he ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to read his Letters.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as <hi>Parmenio</hi> had eſpied <hi>Polidamus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
afar off, with a ſemblance of joy (as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his countenance) he ran to imbrace him, and
after ſalutation given to each other, he delivered
the Kings Letter: As he was uncloſing it, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of <hi>Polidamus</hi> what the King intended to
do? <hi>You ſhall know that,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>by the Contents of
our Letters:</hi> Which when he had read, <hi>I perceive
(quoth</hi> Parmenio) <hi>that the King purpoſeth a Voyage
againſt the</hi> Arachoſians; <hi>Surely he is a painful Prince,
and never in reſt: But now, after ſo much glory won,
it were time for him to take his eaſe, and have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of his health and ſafeguard.</hi> And then he
read the other Letter, written in the Name of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotas;</hi>
whereat he was joyful, as appeared by his
countenance: With that <hi>Cleander</hi> ſtabbed him with
his Sword in his ſide, and after ſtriking him over
the throat, the reſidue thruſt him in, as he lay a
dying.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Parmenio</hi>'s men, who ſtood near at hand, and
ſaw the murder, whereof they knew not the cauſe,
ran into the Camp, and with their troublous ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
ſet all the Souldiers in an uproar: They ran
ſtraight to Arms, and cluſtring together about the
place where the murder was done, they made an
exclamation, that except <hi>Polidamus,</hi> and the other
Actors in that deed, were delivered to their hands,
they would overthrow the Wall, and make ſacrifice
to their dead Captain with the bloud of the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:46658:151"/>
               <hi>Cleander</hi> willed the chief of them to be let in,
and recited the Kings Letters, wherein was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Treaſon of <hi>Parmenio</hi> intended againſt
him, with a requeſt to them to ſit in revenge: Then
immediately, upon the Kings pleaſure known, the
Sedition was appeaſed, but the grudge was not rid
out of their hearts: The moſt part departed, ſaving
a few, who inſtantly required, that at the leaſt they
might be ſuffered to bury the body. It was denied
them long, by reaſon of <hi>Cleander,</hi> who dreaded the
Kings diſpleaſure: but becauſe they began to wax
more earneſt, intending to avoid matter of Sedition,
he cut off the Head, which he ſent to the King, and
left them the Body to bury.</p>
            <p>This was the end of <hi>Parmenio,</hi> a Noble-man both
in War and Peace: many things had he done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the King, but the King without him did never
any thing worthy of praiſe: He ſerved and pleaſed,
in all affairs, a King moſt happy and fortunate; and
being threeſcore and ten years of age, executed the
Office of a Captain as lively, as though he had been
young in years, and pretermitted not oftentimes
the parts of a common Souldier: He was quick in
counſel, doughty of deed, well beloved of all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but moſt dear to the common ſort of Souldiers:
Yet whether thoſe things moved him to be King, or
elſe cauſed him to be ſuſpected thereof, it is yet to
be doubted. For whether the words that <hi>Philotas</hi>
ſpake, when he was overcome with the pains of his
laſt torments, were true or falſe, or elſe that he
ſought an end of his pain by accuſing himſelf falſly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it was much doubtful, ſeeing there was no ſuch
thing proved at ſuch time as the matter was moſt
freſh in memory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:46658:151"/>
Such as <hi>Alexander</hi> perceived to grudge at the
death of <hi>Philotas,</hi> were ſeparated from the reſt of
the Army, and put into one Cohort under <hi>Leonidas</hi>
their Captain, who in times paſt was of near fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity
with <hi>Parmenio:</hi> The King did bear privy
diſpleaſure againſt them; and therefore willing to
prove the diſpoſition of every man, he gave warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
throughout the Army, that all ſuch as would
write into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and have their Letters ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conveyed, ſhould bring them to be carried with
ſuch as he would ſend: Whereupon, every man
did write frankly to their Friends ſuch things as
were in their hearts: Some ſhewed themſelves
to be offended with the long Wars, and ſome ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be well pleaſed; but all their Letters were
intercepted, as well of ſuch as commended the King,
as of thoſe that grudged at his doings. Wherefore
he willed ſuch, as by their Letters diſcloſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be weary of the travel of the Wars, for
their reproach, to be put in a Regiment apart from
the reſt; whereby he both gave them occaſion to
ſhew their hardneſs, and beſides, removed the liberty
of their tongues from the credulous ears of the reſt.
Which raſh device, as all other things, turned to
the ſetting forth of the Kings felicity; for in all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities,
they ſhewed themſelves the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>adieſt, and
the moſt forward; and whileſt they coveted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
their reproach, their valiant doings could not
be hidden in ſo ſmall a number, being ſeparated by
themſelves.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being ordered after this manner, he
appointed a Ruler over the <hi>Arians,</hi> and proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his journey againſt the <hi>Araſpians,</hi> who by chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:46658:152"/>
of their names, were called <hi>Evergitans,</hi> ſince
the time that they relieved <hi>Cyrus</hi> Army with Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Victuals, being afflicted with cold and
penury. It was the fifth day before he entred into
their Country, where he underſtood, that <hi>Satri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barzanes,</hi>
who took <hi>Beſſus</hi> part, was with a power
of Horſemen entred again amongſt the <hi>Arrians:</hi>

their aid <hi>Artabaſus</hi> and <hi>Andromachus,</hi> with ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<hi>Greek</hi> Footmen, and ſix hundred Horſemen.
<hi>Alexander</hi> continued threeſcore days in ſetting or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

a great ſum of money, for the notable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

to be their Governour (who was <hi>Darius</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary)
he went to ſubdue the <hi>Arachoſians,</hi> who
border upon the Sea of <hi>Pontus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Men of War, who were under <hi>Parmenio</hi> his
Rule, came then to <hi>Alexander,</hi> being ſix thouſand
<hi>Macedons,</hi> with two hundred of the Nobility, five

which were the chief force of their power.
To theſe <hi>Arachoſians, Memnon</hi> was appointed Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,
with four thouſand Footmen, and ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> from thence entred with his Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Country not known unto ſuch as bordered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, for the Inhabitants would not have conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
with any other people: They were called
<hi>Paramiſadans,</hi> being a very ruſtical kinde of men,
and moſt rude amongſt all the Barbarous Nations,
the hardneſs of the Country had ſo indurated their
diſpoſitions: They lye moſt towards the cold North-Pole,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:46658:152"/>
joyning with the <hi>Bactrians</hi> upon the Weſt,
and bending towards the <hi>Indian</hi> Sea upon the
South. They uſed to build their houſes of Brick;
and becauſe the Land is full of barren Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and void of Timber, they make their whole
houſes of the ſame, which beginning broad beneath,
groweth ever more narrow towards the top; and
like the Keel of a Ship, where the holes are made
above to receive light: Such of their Pines and Trees
that bring forth fruit, which they will preſerve from
the violence of the cold, they cover with earth du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Winter-ſeaſons; and when the Snow is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
away, they reſtore them again to the Air, and
to the Sun: The earth was there covered with
Snow, and frozen ſo hard, that there remained no
ſigne of any Bird or Beaſt within the Country: The
Air beſides was ſo dark, that little light appeared;
but the earth being covered as it were with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

cold, wearineſs and deſpair: There were
many of them that died for cold, and the Snow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
their feet, but eſpecially it took away the
ſight of many. When they were wearied, and not
able to travel any further, they laid themſelves
down upon the frozen Snow, and having once left
the motion of their bodies, which ſtirred in them
their natural heat, they were ſtraightways ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed
with cold, that they could not riſe again,
till they were lifted up by their Companions; and
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:46658:153"/>
there was no remedy for it, but to compel them to
go forwards; for then by ſtirring of themſelves,
their natural heat was revived, and they recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
again ſome ſtrength. Such as recovered the Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
wherein the Country-men dwelled, were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well refreſhed; but the darkneſs was ſo great,
that the houſes could not be otherwiſe diſcerned,
then by the ſmoak.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants that had never ſeen Strangers
before amongſt them, when they beheld the armed
men coming ſuddenly upon them, were amazed for
fear, and brought forth whatſoever they had, to
ſave their bodies from violence. <hi>Alexander</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on foot amongſt his men, raſing ſuch as were
down, and relieving ſuch as he ſaw afflicted with
the cold with his own cloaths: He was ſeen one
while in the Van, another while in the middeſt,
and ſometime in the Rereward, to the great travel
of his body. At length they came to places better
manured, where he refreſhed his Army with plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

time as the Souldiers that were left behinde did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake

where, in a Rock that is ten furlongs in compaſs,
Antiquity fained that <hi>Prometheus</hi> lay bound. At the

to build a City, wherein he placed ſeven thouſand
of the moſt Ancient <hi>Macedons,</hi> and ſuch others

and according to the cuſtom of thoſe, in the

and his Captains, for the maintenance of the
Wars: And when they were well charged with
Wine, they extolled greatly their own power, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing
the raſhneſs of their Enemies, and their ſmall

where the River of <hi>Oxus</hi> ſhould be as a Wall betwixt

beyond the River of <hi>Tanais,</hi> would come to his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
of whom there was none ſo low, that any
<hi>Macedon,</hi> with the top of his head, could reach to

to him, affirming that only to be the wiſeſt way:

            </p>
            <p>There was at that Feaſt one <hi>Cobares</hi> a <hi>Median,</hi>
who in the Art Magick (if it be an Art, and not
rather a deceit of ſome vain man) was more nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by his profeſſion then by his knowledge, but
otherwiſe a moderate and an honeſt man; he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a preamble before his diſcourſe, ſaid: <hi>He was
not ignorant how much better it were to be obedient to
others counſel, then to be a counſel-giver: For ſuch
as are followers of other mens judgments, are ſure to
have no worſe fortune then the reſt: but ſuch as are
Authors and perſwaders of any matter, commonly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
their own peril;</hi> and therewith delivered the
Cup he had in his hand, and proceeded thus:</p>
            <p>The Nature of Man, in this reſpect, may be called
perverſe, becauſe every one can ſee better into other mens
affairs then into his own: Their counſels muſt needs
be always full of perturbations, who take their own
advice; for fear is an impediment to ſome, deſire unto
other, and to many, a ſelf-love of the thing that they
have deviſed. I will not ſpeak of pride, nor impute it
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:46658:154"/>
unto any man; ye have ſeen by experience how every
one doth eſteem that thing only to be beſt, which he
himſelf hath invented: The Diadem of a King that
you wear upon your head, is a great burthen, which
though it be born moderately, the weight thereof will
oppreſs the bearer. It is not fury can avail in this
caſe, but wiſe and prudent counſel.</p>
            <p>When he had ſpoken thoſe words, he rehearſed
a Proverb commonly uſed amongſt the <hi>Bactrians,</hi>
which is, <hi>That a fearful Dog doth bark more then
bite; and that the deepeſt Rivers do run with leaſt
noiſe;</hi> which things I have rehearſed, becauſe ſuch
prudence may appear as remained amongſt the
Barbarous. As he talked after this manner, ſuch
as heard him wondred to what end his diſcourſe
would tend: Then he began to ſhew his advice,
which was more profitable to <hi>Beſſus</hi> then grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexanders</hi> celerity (<hi>quoth he</hi>) is ſuch, that he
is come in a manner to the entry of your Court; he can
remove his Army before you can remove this Table: You
ſay that you will draw your aſſiſtance from his River of
<hi>Tanais,</hi> and that you will put Rivers betwixt you and
your Enemies; I would know, if he be not able to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
whereſoever you ſhall fly. If the way be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
it muſt needs be m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſt eaſie and aſſured to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour:
And though you think fear doth make much
ſpeed, yet hope is more ſwift. It were therefore me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
expedient, to procure the favour of him that is
the Mightieſt, and yield your ſelf to the Stronger: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he ſhall accept it, your Fortune is more like to be
better that way, then to remain ſtill an Enemy. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that you poſſeſs another mans Kingdom, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:46658:155"/>
you may the better depart therewith: For ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a juſt King, till ye receive the Kingdom of him
that is able to give it, and take it away. This is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
counſel, wherefore it is not neceſſary to delay the
execution thereof: The Horſe that is of Noble courage,
will be governed by the ſhadow of a Rod; but the dull
beaſt is not pricked forwards with the Spur.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beſſus,</hi> that was fierce of nature, and well ſet
forwards with drink, became in ſuch a fury at his
words, that he could ſcarcely be withheld by his
Friend from ſlaying <hi>Cobares,</hi> for he pulled out his
Sword to have done the deed, and departed out of
the Feaſt in a great rage: But <hi>Cobares</hi> in the tumult
eſcaped away, and came unto <hi>Alexander. Beſſus</hi>
had eight thouſand <hi>Bactrians</hi> armed attending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, who ſo long as they judged by the intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perateneſs
of the Air in theſe parts, the <hi>Macedons</hi>
would rather have gone into <hi>India</hi> then into <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctria,</hi>
were very obedient to his Commandment:
But when they underſtood that <hi>Alexander</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards them, every one ſhrunk away, and
forſook <hi>Beſſus.</hi> Then he with a Band of his own
Family, who were yet faithful unto him, paſſed the
River of <hi>Oxus,</hi> burning ſuch Boats as carried him
over, becauſe the ſame ſhould not ſerve his Enemy
in following him, and aſſembled a new power
amongſt the <hi>Sogdians. Alexander,</hi> as it hath been
ſaid before, paſſed Mount <hi>Caucaſus;</hi> but for
want of Corn, his Army was brought to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of hunger: Inſtead of Oyl, they were fain
to anoint themſelves with a juyce, which they
wrung out of <hi>Seſeman,</hi> every meaſure whereof was
called <hi>Amphora,</hi> and ſold for 240 Deniers; every like
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:46658:155"/>
meaſure of honey for 390, and of wine for 300, and
yet of the ſame very little to be had. They have in
that Country certain Veſſels called <hi>Siry,</hi> which the
Inhabitants do uſe to hide ſo privily, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be found except they be digged for within the
earth. The Country-men bury there their Corn
after that manner, for want whereof the Souldiers
were fain to live with Herbs, and ſuch Fiſh as they
caught in the Rivers: But that kinde of food failing
alſo, they were inforced to kill their Carriage-Beaſts,
and lived with the fleſh of them until they came
into <hi>Bactria;</hi> the nature of the ſoil of which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
is of ſundry kindes. Some places are plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of Wood and Vines, and abundant of pleaſant
fruit; the ground is fat, well watered, and full of
Springs, and ſome as barren.</p>
            <p>Thoſe parts which be moſt temperate, are ſowed
with Corn, and the reſt are reſerved for feeding of
Beaſts: But the greater part of that Country is
covered over with barren Sands, and withered up
for want of moiſture, nouriſhing neither man, nor
bringing forth fruit, but with certain windes that
come from the Sea of <hi>Pontus:</hi> The Sand in the plains
is blown together in heaps, which ſeem afar off
like great Hills; whereby the accuſtomed ways be ſo
ſhut up, that no ſigne of them can appear: Therefore
ſuch as do poſſeſs thoſe plains, uſe to obſerve the
ſtars in the night, as they do who ſail on the Seas, by
the courſe of them directing their journey: The
nights, for the moſt part, be brighter then the days;
wherefore in the day-time the Country is wilde and
unpaſſable, when they can neither finde any tract,
nor any way to go in, nor mark nor ſigne where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:46658:156"/>
to paſs, the Stars being hidden by the Miſt:
If the ſame winde chance to come, during the time
that men be paſſing, it overwhelmeth them with
Sand.</p>
            <p>Where the Country is temperate, it bringeth
forth great plenty both of men and horſe; ſo that
the <hi>Bactrians</hi> may make thirty thouſand Horſemen.
<hi>Bactria,</hi> which is the Head-City of that Region,
ſtandeth under a Mountain called <hi>Parapaniſus:</hi> The
River called <hi>Bactria</hi> runneth by the Walls, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
both the City and the Country take their
names.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> being there in Camp, received Letters
out of <hi>Greece,</hi> how the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and the
whole Country of <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> had rebelled againſt
him: For they had not loſt the Battel at ſuch time
as the Meſſengers were diſpatched, that brought
the news of their revolt. In the neck of theſe evil
tidings, there came another preſent terrour, which
was, that the <hi>Scythians</hi> inhabiting beyond the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of <hi>Tanais,</hi> were coming to aid <hi>Beſſus.</hi> At the
ſame time alſo, tidings came unto him of the Battel
that <hi>Caranus</hi> and <hi>Erigius</hi> had fought with the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
where <hi>Satribarzanes,</hi> that was newly revolted,
being Chief of the Country, ſeeing the Battel to
remain equal on both ſides, rid into the forefront,
and plucked off his Helmet, forbidding any of his
ſide, either to caſt dart, or ſtrike a ſtroke; and
there made a challenge to fight hand to hand, if any
man durſt come forth and prove his ſtrength.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Erigius,</hi> Captain to the <hi>Macedons,</hi> was a man
ſtricken in years, but yet not inferiour to any young
man in ſtoutneſs of ſtomack, or ſtrength of body;
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:46658:156"/>
who could not bear the proud arrogancy of <hi>Satri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barzanes,</hi>
but ſtepping forwards, and plucking off
his Helmet, ſhewed his hoary hair: <hi>The day is
come</hi> (quoth he) <hi>that I will either by the victory, or by
my honeſt death, make tryal what kinde of men</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander
<hi>hath to his Friends and Souldiers;</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
more words he made towards his Enemy. It
could not be judged, but that both Armies had ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their hands by appointment, for they gave back
immediately on both ſides, to let them have free
ſcope, each party ſtanding in expectation what
ſhould become of the Challenger; for they could
not but think themſelves partakers of their adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<hi>Satribarzanes</hi> firſt charged his Staff, which
<hi>Erigius</hi> avoided by bending his head aſide; but he
in the midſt of his Race, ſtruck the other with his
Spear through the throat, ſo that it came forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
at his neck. <hi>Satribarzanes,</hi> upon that ſtroak,
fell down from his Horſe; but yet made reſiſtance,
till ſuch time as <hi>Erigius</hi> plucked the Spear out of the
wound, and thruſt it again into his mouth; who
to rid himſelf out of pain, furthered his Enemies
ſtroke: Then the <hi>Arians</hi> ſeeing their Captain ſlain,
whom they had followed rather of neceſſity, then
of their own free wills, called to remembrance
<hi>Alexanders</hi> benefits, and yielded themſelves unto
<hi>Erigius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> rejoyced much at the good ſucceſs of
this Enterpriſe, doubting greatly the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
but he did bear out their Rebellion ſtoutly,
ſaying, <hi>That they durſt never diſcloſe their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
until they knew he was come to the Confines
of</hi> India. <hi>Alexander</hi> having removed his Camp,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:46658:157"/>
and going forwards in the purſuit of <hi>Beſſus, Erigius</hi>
met him, preſenting the ſpoil of his Enemy, as a
memorial of his Victory. Thereupon, he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Rule of <hi>Bactria</hi> to <hi>Artabaſus,</hi> where with a
Garriſon he left his Carriage; and with a power
that was light, and fit for travel, he entred into
the Deſarts of the <hi>Suſitans,</hi> conveying his Army by
night.</p>
            <p>In the want of water (that hath been declared
before) deſperation moved them to thirſt, before
they had deſire to drink: For by the ſpace of four
hundred furlongs, they found no water at all.
The vapours of the Sun, in the Summer-ſeaſon, did
ſo burn the Land, that when it began to wax hot,
it ſcorched all things, as it had been with a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
fire: And then the light being ſomewhat ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured
by the Miſt that roſe out of the earth by the
immoderate heat, cauſed the Plains to have an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of the Main Sea.</p>
            <p>Their journey in the night ſeemed tolerable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their bodies were ſomewhat refreſhed with
the Dew, and the cold of the morning: But when
the day came, and the heat roſe, then the drought
drying up all their natural humours, both their
mouths and their bowels were inflamed with heat:
Then their hearts failed, and their bodies fainted,
being in ſuch a condition, that they could neither
ſtand ſtill, nor paſs forwards. A few that were
taught by ſuch as knew the Country, had gotten
water, which refreſhed them ſomewhat; but as the
heat increaſed, ſo their deſire grew again to drink:
There was no remedy, but to give amongſt the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
all the Wine and Oyl that remained in ſtore;
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:46658:157"/>
for drink was ſo ſweet unto them, that it took away
the fear of any thirſt to come: But ſuch as had
greedily gulped in the water that they got, became
ſo heavy, that they were neither able to bear their
Armour, nor go forwards: ſo that they ſeemed moſt
happy who had gotten no water at all; for ſuch as
had taken of it inordinately, were inforced by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to put up the ſame again.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Alexander</hi> carefully in this calamity ſtood
with his Friends that were perſwading him to have
reſpect to himſelf, for that he only, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his heart, ſhould be ſome relief unto them
in his adverſity; there came two Souldiers, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before with ſuch as had taken up the Camp, had
found water, and were carrying of it in Bottles un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Sons, which were ſore afflicted for want of
drink behinde in the Army: When they ſaw the
King, one of them opened his Bottle, and filling a
Cup, preſented the water to the King, who receiving
it at his hand, demanded to whom they carried that
water; they ſaid, to their Sons: Then he reſtored
the Cup again full, as it was given him, and ſaid: <hi>I
will not drink alone; for ſo little cannot be divided
amongſt us all: Make you haſte therefore to carry to
your Sons that you have gotten with your travel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Alexander</hi> travelled ſo long, that before
night he came to the River of <hi>Oxus:</hi> The more part
of the Army, not able to follow for feebleneſs, were
left far behinde; to the intent therefore that ſuch as
followed after, might know where the Camp was,
he cauſed a fire to be made on the top of an hill,
and gave order, that when the Vaward had refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves with meat and drink, they ſhould
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:46658:158"/>
fill their Bottles with water, and go back with the
ſame to relieve their fellows. The breath of ſuch as
drank intemperately cloſed up, and they died im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately:
The number of theſe men was greater,
then ever <hi>Alexander</hi> loſt in any Battel; but he
would neither put off his Arms, refreſh himſelf
with meat or drink, nor eaſe his body, but ſtood
in the way where his Army paſſed, not departing
till the laſt man was come into the Camp. He
watched all that night, and paſſed it over in great
trouble of minde; and the day that enſued brought
no releaſe of his care; for there were neither Boats
to paſs the River withal, nor could he make any
Bridge, ſeeing there was no Wood growing nigh
at hand. But at length he found out a device,
whereunto only neceſſity did inforce him: They
took Beaſts skins, and ſtuffed them full of Straw,
whereupon they laid themſelves, and ſo ſwimmed
over the River. Such as firſt recovered the further
ſide, ſtood in order of Battel till the reſt were paſſed
over; by which means, in ſix days, he conveyed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his whole Army.</p>
            <p>Having paſſed the River of <hi>Oxus,</hi> his purpoſe
was to go forwards in the purſuit of <hi>Beſſus,</hi> till he
underſtood ſuch things as had chanced among the
<hi>Suſitans.</hi> There was one <hi>Spitamenes,</hi> whom <hi>Beſſus</hi>
chiefly honoured of all his friends: But there are
no benefits that can ſtay a man given up to perjury,
which in him was the more tolerable, becauſe he
judged no miſchief too great for him who had ſlain
his Prince; for the revenge of <hi>Darius</hi> was a fair co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
to his offence: But it is to be thought, that his
preſent fortune was more envied, then his paſt
actions were hated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:46658:158"/>
When it was known that <hi>Alexander</hi> had advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
over the River of <hi>Oxus, Spitamenes</hi> did aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
with him in counſel for his enterpriſe <hi>Datapher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
and <hi>Catenes,</hi> whom <hi>Beſſus</hi> ſpecially truſted:
They agreed to the Deſigne more readily then he
would deſire them; and taking to them eight
young men that were ſtrong of perſonage, uſed
this kinde of policy. <hi>Spitamines</hi> repaired to <hi>Beſſus,</hi>
and getting him alone, informed him, that he had
found out how <hi>Dataphernes</hi> and <hi>Catanes</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
to deliver him into <hi>Alexanders</hi> hands; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
(he ſaid) he had prevented them, while they were
about their purpoſe, having taken them both, and
put them faſt in priſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beſſus</hi> then thinking himſelf much bound unto
him for ſo great a good turn, gave him many
thanks; and for the deſire he had to be revenged of
his Enemies, willed <hi>Spitamenes</hi> to bring them to his
preſence: He cauſed their hands to be bound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
their backs, and to be brought by ſuch as
were privy to their Confederacy. When they came
in <hi>Beſſus</hi> preſence, he beheld them with a full coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and roſe up to have ſtruck at them: But
then they left their counterfeiting, and ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
incloſing <hi>Beſſus</hi> about, bound him; he ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in vain; and pulled the Diadem from his
Head, tearing the Garments from his Back, which
ſometimes belonged to his Prince whom he had
ſlain.</p>
            <p>When he ſaw himſelf in this condition, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
that the gods had righteouſly revenged his
Treaſon; and perceived by the Plague they ſent
him, that they both favoured <hi>Darius,</hi> and were
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:46658:159"/>
friends to <hi>Alexander,</hi> whoſe Enemies evermore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
his Victory. It is uncertain whether the
multitude would have aſſiſted <hi>Beſſus</hi> or not, but
that <hi>Spitamenes</hi> had given forth, that it was done
by <hi>Alexanders</hi> appointment; whereby he put them
into a fear, being yet doubtful of minde, and ſet
<hi>Beſſus</hi> upon an horſe, on the which he brought him
unto <hi>Alexander,</hi> who in the mean ſeaſon had choſen
out 900, ſuch as by reaſon of their Age were not
meet for the Wars, and gave to every Horſeman
two Talents, and to every Footman three thouſand
Deniers. That done, he diſpatched them home,
and gave thanks unto the reſt, becauſe they promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to tarry with him until he had brought his Wars
to an end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beſſus</hi> was preſented unto him at a little Town,
whereof the Inhabitants are called <hi>Branchidans,</hi>
who in times paſt, by the Commandment of <hi>Xerxes,</hi>
when he came out of <hi>Greece,</hi> were brought from <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letum,</hi>
and placed there, becauſe that in his favour
they had violated a Temple called <hi>Didyma.</hi> They
had not altogether forgotten their Country Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms,
but had mixed their tongue, which by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and little degenerated from their own Language,
and had not yet attained fully that Country-ſpeech.
They received the King with great joy,
yeilding themſelves and their City unto his will:
Whereupon he called to him the <hi>Mileſians</hi> that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him in his Wars (who bare an ancient hatred
againſt this Generation of the <hi>Branchidans</hi>) and
left it to them to determine, whether they would
ſave them for the Country ſake, or elſe deſtroy
them for the injury they had done them in times
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:46658:159"/>
paſt. But when the <hi>Mileſians</hi> could not agree in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
he ſaid he would order the matter himſelf.</p>
            <p>The next day, when the <hi>Brandichans</hi> came to
meet him, he returned them all again into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and commanded the Footmen to incloſe the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
round, and entred with ſuch as he had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for that purpoſe; and by a token given, he put
all to the Sword, and razed the City as a Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of Traytors, they being without Armour in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
place: Neither the Affinity of their Tongue, nor
any prayer or interceſſion could mitigate their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
cruelty, who after the deſtruction of the Town,
did caſt down the Walls to the ground, ſo that no
memory of them doth remain. That done, they did
not only cut down the Woods, wherein they uſed
their Sacrifice, but alſo plucked up the Trees by the
Roots, that the ground might be left bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate.
If the ſame things had been done againſt
the very Offenders, the revenge might have been
thought righteous: But to lay the fault of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors
upon their Poſterity, it is judged as a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
act, being there were not any of them then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
that had ever ſeen <hi>Miletum,</hi> or done to <hi>Xer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes</hi>
any kinde of pleaſure. As <hi>Alexander</hi> removed
from thence, towards the River of <hi>Tanais, Beſſus</hi> was
brought before him, ſpoiled of all his Garments,
whom <hi>Spitamenes</hi> led in a Chain put about his
Neck; a pleaſant ſight to behold, as well to the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous,
as to the <hi>Macedons.</hi> When <hi>Spitamenes</hi> was
come with him into <hi>Alexanders</hi> preſence, he ſaid:</p>
            <p>I have brought here unto you the Killer of his own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
after the ſame manner that he himſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the
example; wherein I have both revenged <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:46658:160"/>
was my King, and you alſo that now have gained the
Soveraignty. Let <hi>Darius</hi> open his eyes, and riſe from
Death, to behold this ſight, who was unworthy of ſuch
an end, and worthy to behold and receive ſuch a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle
as this.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Alexander</hi> had given <hi>Spitamenes</hi> thanks, he
turned himſelf unto <hi>Beſſus,</hi> and ſaid:</p>
            <p>What beaſtly fury moved thee to take thine own
Prince Priſoner, and afterwards to kill him, having ſo
well deſerved of thee? Of which thy doings, thou
ſhalt receive a ſufficient reward, by uſurping the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
Name of a King.</p>
            <p>He had no heart to make anſwer, or to excuſe his
offence, ſaving that he ſaid: <hi>He took upon him to be
a King, becauſe he might deliver him the poſſeſſion of
the Country; which thing if he had omitted, ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
he ſaid, <hi>would have taken it in hand.</hi> Then <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
called for <hi>Oxatres, Darius</hi> Brother, whom
he had placed about his perſon, and committed <hi>Beſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>
to his keeping, to the intent he ſhould cut off his
Ears and Noſe, and hang him upon a Croſs, cauſing
his own men to ſhoot him through with Arrows,
and ſo preſerve his body that Birds ſhould not touch
him. <hi>Oxatres</hi> promiſed to perform all the reſt, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the keeping away the Birds; which for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
he had to ſet forth <hi>Catenes</hi> cunning, he affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that none could ſo well keep them away as he,
who did ſhoot ſo aſſuredly, that he could ſtrike the
Birds flying in the Air: And though it was a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
not ſo much to be marvelled at in a Nation ſo
expert in ſhooting, yet it was greatly admired by
ſuch as did behold him, and it was great honour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the doer. He gave rewards unto ſuch as were the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:46658:160"/>
Apprehenders of <hi>Beſſus;</hi> but he deferred his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
becauſe he minded to put him to death in the
ſame place where he ſlew <hi>Darius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean ſeaſon, the <hi>Macedons</hi> going a forra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
without order, were overthrown by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
that came running down the next Mountains:
They took more then they did kill; and driving
their priſoners before them, retired again unto the
Mountains. There were of them to the number of
twenty thouſand, who accuſtomed to live by Theft,
uſing Slings and Bows in their Fight, whom while
<hi>Alexander</hi> did beſiege, and in a Skirmiſh preſſed
upon the foremoſt, he was ſtricken with an Arrow
in the midſt of his Leg, where the Head did ſtick
faſt. The <hi>Macedons</hi> that were ſorrowful and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
for their Kings hurt, carried him into his Tent;
of whoſe departure out of the Field his Enemies
were not ignorant, for they might behold all things
from the Mountains. The next day they ſent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours
to <hi>Alexander,</hi> whom he admitted to his
preſence, and unfolding his wounds (whereby he
thought to diſſemble the greatneſs thereof) he
ſhewed his Leg unto them: When they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to ſit down, they ſaid, <hi>That hearing of his
hurt, they were as ſorrowful for it as his own Subjects,
which ſhould well be known; for if they could finde
out the perſon that did the deed, he ſhould be delivered
into his hands: They could not</hi> (they ſaid) <hi>but judge
them ſacrilegious perſons, who would fight with gods,
of whoſe number they ſuppoſed him to be; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were determined to yield themſelves.</hi> Thereupon
he gave them aſſurance, and receiving again his men
that were taken priſoners, he admitted them to be
his Subjects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:46658:161"/>
That done, he removed his Camp, and was carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a Litter, for the bearing whereof, the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Footmen contended together; the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
alledged it to be their Office, becauſe the King
uſed to fight amongſt them; and the Footmen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
that in as much as they uſed to carry the
wounded Souldiers, they thought no reaſon their
Office ſhould be taken from them, chiefly when the
King ſhould be carried. <hi>Alexander</hi> therefore in ſo
great contention of both parties, thought it a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
matter for him to give ſentence, becauſe the
judgment ſhould be grievous to them that ſhould be
put by their Office; and therefore ordered that they
ſhould carry him by courſe.</p>
            <p>From thence, the fourth day, he came unto a City
called <hi>Maracanda,</hi> the Walls whereof were three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
and ten furlongs about, but the Caſtle was
without any Wall: He ſet a Garriſon in the City,
and then burned and deſtroyed the Country there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts.
Embaſſadours came unto him thither from
thoſe <hi>Scythians</hi> which are called <hi>Avians,</hi> who had
been free ſince the time that <hi>Cyrus</hi> was among
them, but yet they ſhewed themſelves then ready
to be at his Commandment: They were known to
be the moſt righteous people of all the barbarous
Nations, as men that never uſed to make War, but
when they were provoked; whoſe moderation and
temperance in uſing of their liberty, made the Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
equal unto the Superiours,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> received them gently, and ſent <hi>Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi>
a Friend of his, to thoſe <hi>Scythians</hi> that inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
within <hi>Europe,</hi> to forbid them to paſs the
River of <hi>Tanais</hi> without his appointment: He had
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:46658:161"/>
alſo a ſecret Commiſſion to view the ſcituation of
that Country, and to viſit thoſe <hi>Scythians</hi> that
inhabited about <hi>Boſphorus.</hi> He willed him beſides,
to chuſe out a place upon the brink of <hi>Tanais,</hi>
where he might build a City, to remain as a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,
for the ſubduing of the people that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to viſit.</p>
            <p>But this deſigne was delayed by the Rebellion of
the <hi>Sogdians,</hi> who had alſo drawn the <hi>Bactrians</hi> to
their part. There were of them ſeven thouſand
Horſemen, whoſe Authority the reſt followed: For
the ſubduing of whom, <hi>Alexander</hi> cauſed <hi>Spitame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
and <hi>Catones</hi> (the Betrayers of <hi>Beſſus</hi>) to be
ſent for, thinking by their means to bring the
Country again to his obedience, and to ſuppreſs thoſe
who had made this ſtir: But they who were judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
meet to ſtay the Rebellion, and were ſent for to
that intent, were the chief Authors of that Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion;
for they cauſed it to be noiſed abroad, that
<hi>Alexander</hi> had ſent for the <hi>Bactrian</hi> Horſemen of
purpoſe to deſtroy them all; which Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(they ſaid) being appointed to them, they
would not execute, becauſe they thought it too
foul an act to commit againſt their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
and for that cauſe they could as ill bear <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexanders</hi>
cruelty then, as in times paſt <hi>Beſſus</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>By this means, when the fear of death was
put into their heads, they were eaſily ſtirred to
Arms, to which before they were ſufficiently
inclined of their own mindes. When <hi>Alexander</hi> was
advertiſed of their doings, he willed <hi>Craterus</hi> to
beſiege <hi>Cyropolis,</hi> and he himſelf won another City
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:46658:162"/>
of that Country, by an aſſault that he gave to it on
all parts at once; and by a ſigne given, cauſed all
the Children to be put to death, making the reſt a
prey for the Souldiers: This done, the City was
razed to the ground, to the intent, that others by
their example might be kept in obedience. There
were a valiant people, called <hi>Memacenans,</hi> who
were determined to abide the Siege, not only for
their honeſties ſake, but alſo for that they thought
it moſt for their Surety: For the mitigating of their
wilfulneſs, the King ſent unto them fifty Horſemen,
to declare his Clemency towards ſuch as ſubmitted
themſelves, and how inexorable he was unto ſuch
as he overcome by force: Their anſwer was, <hi>That
they neither doubted the Kings Promiſe, nor his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:</hi>
But after their anſwer given, they lodged them
without the walls; where entertaining them with
great Chear until it was mid-night, they ſet upon
them, and ſlew them all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> was no leſs moved with this Act, then
the cauſe required: He therefore made an aſſault
upon the City on all parts at once; which he found
furniſhed in ſuch wiſe, that he could not take it at
the firſt attempt: Wherefore he appointed <hi>Melea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
and <hi>Perdicas</hi> unto the Siege thereof, who then
were beſieging of <hi>Cyropolis,</hi> minding to ſpare the
ſame, becauſe it was builded by <hi>Cyrus;</hi> for he had
not ſo great admiration of any King that had
Reigned in thoſe parts, as of him and <hi>Semiramis,</hi>
whoſe magnanimity of minde, and great atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
ſeemed to him to exceed the reſt: But the
obſtinate wilfulneſs of the Inhabitants ſtirred up his
wrath; for when he had taken the City, he willed
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:46658:162"/>
the <hi>Macedons</hi> to ſpoil it, who had enough cauſe to
be moved againſt them; and ſo returned to <hi>Melea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
and <hi>Perdicas.</hi> There was not one City that did
more valiantly abide the Siege, then the ſame did;
for both the hardieſt of the Souldiers that were ſlain,
and the King was brought in great danger, being
ſtruck in the Neck with a ſtone, ſo that his ſight
failed him; and he was felled to the Earth, and
for the preſent loſt his ſenſe. The Army lamented,
thinking he had been dead: But he was invincible
againſt thoſe things which put other men in moſt
fear; for without tarrying, he dreſſed his wound,
returning to the Fight: and after anger had ſtirred
up the eagerneſs he had of Nature, he renewed
the aſſault more fiercely then before. At length a
great piece of the Wall was overthrown by a Mine,
at which he brake in, and put the whole City to
Sack and Ruine. He ſent from thence <hi>Menedemus</hi>
with 3000 Footmen, and 800 Horſemen, to the
City of <hi>Maracanda,</hi> which <hi>Spitamenes</hi> had newly
taken, and put out from thence the Garriſon of
the <hi>Macedons,</hi> the Citizens not conſenting to
it: But when they ſaw they could not withſtand
him, it was of neceſſity for them to agree to his
will.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander,</hi> in the mean ſeaſon, came to the River
of <hi>Tanais,</hi> where he incloſed about with a wall ſo
much ground as his Camp did contain, extending
in compaſs 60 furlongs, and named the ſame Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>Alexandria.</hi> This was done with ſuch expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that within ſeventeen days after the walls were
raiſed, the houſes alſo were builded, and the whole
work was performed in a very ſmall ſeaſon, through
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:46658:163"/>
the contention amongſt the Souldiers, who ſhould
perform his work firſt, when the ſame was divided
into portions amongſt them. The priſoners (whoſe
Ranſoms <hi>Alexander</hi> paid to their Takes) were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to inhabit this City; the deſcent of whom,
after ſo long time, are not worn out, ſuch favour
hath been ſhewed them in the memory of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</hi>
The King of <hi>Scythia,</hi> whoſe Empire was
then beyond the River of <hi>Tanais,</hi> judging that the
fortifying upon the Rivers ſide ſhould be as a Yoke
to his Neck, did ſend his Brother <hi>Carcaſis</hi> with a
great power of Horſemen to beat down the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
and to remove away the <hi>Macedons</hi> from
the waters ſide: That River divideth the <hi>Bactrians</hi>
from the <hi>Scythians</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> and is the limit which
parteth <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> aſunder: But the Countries
that the <hi>Scythians</hi> do inhabit, do ſtretch as far as
<hi>Thracia,</hi> and lye betwixt the <hi>North</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt,</hi>
joyning with <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> and poſſeſſing part of it.
The Country alſo that lieth beyond the River of
<hi>Iſther,</hi> is inhabited by them; their utmoſt bounds
ſtretching to <hi>Bactria,</hi> and to the furtheſt bounds of
<hi>Aſia</hi> Northwards, where are wonderful great Woods,
and wilde Deſarts: But ſuch of them as bounded
near unto <hi>Tanais</hi> and <hi>Bactria,</hi> wanted not much of
the civility of other Nations.</p>
            <p>This being the firſt time that <hi>Alexander</hi> had to
do with theſe people, when he ſaw that he had to
enter into a War for the which he was not provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
his Enemies riding up and down in his ſight,
and he diſeaſed of his wound, eſpecially not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the uſe of his ſpeech, which failed much by
reaſon of his long abſtinence, and the pain in his
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:46658:163"/>
Neck, he called his friends to counſel, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto them, that he was not troubled with any
fear of his enemies, but with the iniquity of the
time; the <hi>Bactrians</hi> rebelling, and the <hi>Scythians</hi>
provoking him, when he was neither able to ſtand
upon the ground, nor ſtrong enough to ride on
Horſeback, nor yet in caſe to give advice or exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to his men: In conſideration therefore of the
doubtful danger in which he ſaw himſelf involved,
he accuſed the gods; complaining, that he was then
inforced to lye ſtill, whoſe ſwiftneſs before-time
none was able to eſcape.</p>
            <p>The danger grew ſo great, that his own men
believed he had counterfeited his ſickneſs for fear:
And therefore he, who ſince the overthrow of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
had left Conſultation with the Diviners and
Prophets, turned himſelf again to the vanity and
ſuperſtition of men, willing <hi>Ariſtander</hi> (unto whom
he was addicted moſt) that he ſhould try out by
Sacrifice what his ſucceſs ſhould be: The Cuſtom
of them who were called <hi>Aruſpices,</hi> was to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Entrails of the Beaſts without the King, and
to make report of the ſignification. In the mean
ſeaſon, while they were ſearching ſecrets that way,
he willed <hi>Epheſtion, Craterus, Erigius,</hi> and others of
his Friends, to draw near about him, leſt by ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his voice, he might break out his wound again,
and ſaid thus unto them:</p>
            <p>The danger I am in, hath cauſed the time to ſerve
better for mine Enemies, then for me: Neceſſity, I ſee,
chiefly in the Wars, doth go before Reaſon; for it is
ſeldom given to men to chuſe their own time: The
<hi>Bactrians</hi> are revolted, upon whoſe Shoulders yet we
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:46658:164"/>
ſtand, purpoſing to try what courage we are of by our
behaviour towards the <hi>Scythians.</hi> If we leave off
with doubtful fortune, and not meddle with them,
who of their own minde have provoked us, we ſhall,
at our return, be had in contempt of them whom we
intend to viſit: But if we ſhall paſs the River of
<hi>Tanais,</hi> and by the deſtruction of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> ſhew
our ſelves invincible every where, who will then doubt
but <hi>Europe</hi> will lye open, and give Obedience to us
being Victors? He is deceived, that doth meaſure by
any diſtance the bounds of glory we intend to paſs:
There is but one River that letteth us now, for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our Power over into <hi>Europe;</hi> which if we ſhall
effect, what an eſtimation ſhall it be for us, whiles
we be ſubduing of <hi>Aſia,</hi> to ſet up the Monuments of
our Victories, as it were, in a new World, joyning ſo
ſoon together with one Victory, that which Nature
ſeemeth to have divided with ſo great a diſtance?
But if we ſhall ſtay never ſo little, and give ground,
the <hi>Scythians</hi> will then come after us, and purſue us
in the Rear. Are there no more but we who have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Rivers? There are many Inventions yet remaining
amongſt our ſelves, whereby we have gotten many Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories:
But fortune of the War doth teach policy to
ſuch as are overcome; we have ſhewed a Preſident of
late, to ſwim over Rivers upon Bottles; which thing
if the <hi>Scythians</hi> cannot do, the <hi>Bactrians</hi> ſhall teach
them: It is but the Power of one Nation that now
cometh againſt you; all the others ſtand yet in a ſtay,
to underſtand of our doings: So that by eſchewing a
Battel, we ſhall nouriſh War, and be compelled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
thoſe blows, which lye in us to give to others.
The reaſon of my advice is manifeſt: But whether the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:46658:164"/>
               <hi>Macedons</hi> will ſuffer me to uſe my own diſpoſition, I
much doubt; becauſe ſince I received this Wound, I
have not ridden on Horſeback, nor gone on Foot. If
you will follow me, my Friends, I am recovered, I
have ſtrength enough to endure theſe things; and if
the end of my life be at hand, wherein can I ſpend it
better?</p>
            <p>Theſe words that he ſpake, were uttered with a
broken and weak voice, ſo that they could ſcarcely
be heard of ſuch as were next him: But when his
meaning was perceived, all that were preſent went
about to divert him from ſo raſh an Enterpriſe: But
<hi>Erigius</hi> wrought chiefly in the matter, who percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that his Authority could not prevail againſt the
Kings obſtinate minde, attempted to work him by
Religion, which he judged of greater force: For
he declared, that the gods were againſt his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
who had ſignified great peril to enſue, if
he paſſed the River: He ſaid he had underſtood
that thing by <hi>Ariſtander,</hi> who told him at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the Pavilion, what he had perceived in
the Entrails of the Beaſts. <hi>Alexander</hi> at theſe words
was wonderfully troubled with anger and ſhame,
when he ſaw the ſecrets of that Religion brought
to light, which he thought to have kept ſecret to
himſelf; and therefore cauſed <hi>Erigius</hi> to go aſide,
and <hi>Ariſtander</hi> to be called in unto him, whom he
beheld in the face, and ſaid:</p>
            <p>I ſeem to thee rather a private man then a King; I
commanded thee to ſacrifice, and thou haſt declared the
ſignification thereof to others, and not to me: For <hi>Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi>
by thy report, knoweth the ſecrecie appertaining to
me: But ſurely, I believe that through his own fear
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:46658:165"/>
he deviſed an interpretation of himſelf: Therefore let
me hear from thy own mouth what thou haſt found in
the Entrails, to the intent that thou ſhalt not deny
what thou haſt ſpoken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariſtander</hi> thereupon was amazed, and looked
pale, not able to anſwer one word for fear: But at
length, the ſame fear that made him hold his peace,
invited him to ſpeak; and leſt the prolonging of the
Kings expectation, might provoke him unto further
wrath, he anſwered:</p>
            <p>I ſaid (<hi>quoth he</hi>) that there was in the Enterpriſe
great danger and difficulty; bu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> your attempt
ſhould not be in vain: there is nothing that I have
perceived by my Science, that troubleth me ſo much as
the love I bear to you; for I both conſider your infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
and what a moment conſiſteth in your perſon,
fearing you ſhould not be able to endure the things
that fortune is diſpoſed to give unto you.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> heard him ſpeak after that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
he willed him to have confidence in his fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to whom Fortune had granted glory in greater
things; and thereupon diſmiſſed him. Afterwards,
as the King was debating with ſuch as he conſulted
with before, by what means he ſhould paſs the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<hi>Ariſtander</hi> came amongſt them, affirming, that
he had found the Entrails contrary to what he did
before, with as likely ſignes of good ſucceſs as any
that ever he ſaw; ſhewing them then as great cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to rejoyce, as he did before to fear. But imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
hereupon <hi>Alexander</hi> received news that much
impaired that felicity he was wont to have in all
his proceedings: <hi>Menedemus</hi> being ſent (as it hath
been ſaid before) to beſiege <hi>Spitamenes,</hi> the Author
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:46658:165"/>
of the <hi>Bactrian</hi> Rebellion, when he underſtood of
his Enemies coming, both in avoiding to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
within the Walls, and truſting beſides to
take ſome advantage of the <hi>Macedons,</hi> he laid an
ambuſcado to intrap them. There was a Wood
through the which they ſhould paſs, very apt for
the purpoſe, where he laid the <hi>Dahans,</hi> who were
accuſtomed to carry two armed men upon one
Horſe, from whence they uſed to leap down by
courſe; and becauſe the ſwiftneſs of the Footmen
was little inferiour to the Horſemen, they troubled
greatly the order of the Horſemens fight. <hi>Spita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi>
gave order to them, that when they ſhould
enter into the Wood, they ſhould environ them on
all ſides; which they performed according to his
appointment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Menedemus</hi> ſeeing himſelf incloſed on all parts,
and not equal in number unto his Enemies, reſiſted
a great while, crying out to the Souldiers, that
there remained no hope to them, being intrapped af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that manner, but, by making ſlaughter upon their
Enemies, to receive the comfort of an honeſt death.
<hi>Menedemus</hi> rode upon a ſtrong Horſe, charging
oft-times upon his Enemies, whereby he brake their
order, and made great ſlaughter, till ſuch time as
he being laid at on all parts, received many
wounds, and fainted for want of bloud. Then
he exhorted <hi>Hiſpides,</hi> that was one of his Friends, to
leap upon his Horſe, and eſcape away; and with
that word he ſwounded, and fell from his Horſe
to the ground. <hi>Hiſpalis</hi> might have got away, but
after he had loſt his friend, he determined there to
die, taking no other care but how to loſe his life
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:46658:166"/>
with the ruine of his Enemies. Wherefore he put
his Spurs to his Horſe, and ran in amongſt them,
where he fought notably, and at length was
ſlain.</p>
            <p>When the reſt ſaw his overthrow, and the
loſs of their Captains, they recovered an Hill,
where <hi>Spitamenes</hi> did beſiege them, thinking
to ſubdue them for want of Victuals. There
were ſlain in the Battel two Thouſand Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and three Hundred Horſemen; which
miſadventure <hi>Alexander</hi> with great policy kept
ſecret, commanding them that departed from
the Field, upon pain of death not to publiſh this
Defeat. But when he could not bear out any
longer a countenance contrary to his heart, he
went alone to his Pavilion which he had ſet of
purpoſe upon the Rivers ſide. There he walked
all night, deviſing with himſelf what was beſt to
do; and divers times he lifted up his Tent to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the Fires in his Enemies Camp, thereby to
conjecture their number.</p>
            <p>When the day appeared, he put on a Corſlet,
and came forth among the Souldiers, being the firſt
time they had ſeen him ſince he received his hurt.
They bore ſuch a veneration unto their King, that
with his preſence only they put away the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the fear which cauſed them before to
ſhrink; and rejoyced ſo heartily, that when they
ſaluted him, the tears diſtilled from their eyes, and
earneſtly deſired the Fight which they had before
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>uſed. He took order there amongſt them, that
the Horſemen, and ſuch as were of the ſquare Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
of Footmen ſhould be carried over in Boats, and
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:46658:166"/>
that the light armed ſhould ſwim upon Bottles.
The buſineſs required not much more to be ſpoken,
neither could the King ſay much more by reaſon
of his infirmity; for the Souldiers went about it
with ſuch chearfulneſs of minde, that within
three dayes they had finiſhed twelve Thouſand
Boats. When all things were prepared in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for their Paſſage, there came twenty Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
of the <hi>Scythians</hi> riding by the Camp, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
that it might be reported to the King, that
they had ſomething in Commiſſion to declare unto
him.</p>
            <p>When they were received into his Pavilion, and
commanded to ſit down, they fixed their eyes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
upon the Kings countenance; whereby it
was thought, that weighing the greatneſs of
his courage by his perſonage which they ſaw pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
it appeared unto them but ſmall in reſpect
of the Fame they heard of him. The wits of the
<hi>Scythians</hi> are not rude, and without knowledge,
as other barbarous Nations are. For it is ſaid,
that many of them attain to ſuch Learning, as it
is poſſible for a Nation being always in exerciſe of
the Wars. Their words ſpoken unto <hi>Alexander</hi> are
left in memory; who though they differ from the
manner of us, who live in more civil times, and
frame our ſelves to more humanity, yet the fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the matter is not to be deſpiſed, though the
phraſe of their Speech is rough. And therefore
I ſhall declare uncorruptly the words which the
Eldeſt of theſe Embaſſadors did ſpeak after this
manner.</p>
            <p>If the gods had given thee a Body according to the

with one hand, and the Occident with the other; which
thing once obtained, thy care ſhould be to become equal
to the gods. Thus thou doſt covet the thing thou art not
able to compaſs. From <hi>Europe</hi> thou goeſt into <hi>Aſia,</hi>
and from <hi>Aſia</hi> to <hi>Europe.</hi> It muſt come to paſs, that
if thou doeſt overcome all mankinde, thou muſt make war
with Woods and Snows, with Rivers and wilde Beaſts.

            <p>Theſe were the <hi>Scythians</hi> words; to whom the
King made Anſwer:</p>
            <p>That he would both uſe his own Fortune, and their
Counſel that adviſed him well. He would follow his
Fortune (he ſaid,) becauſe he had great confidence in
it; and other mens Counſel becauſe he would do nothing
unadviſedly, nor upon the ſudden.</p>
            <p>Thereupon he diſmiſſed the Embaſſadors, and
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:46658:168"/>
imbarked his Army in the Boats he had prepared.
In the foreparts of the Boats he ſet ſuch as had Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets,
willing them to kneel upon their knees for
their more ſafeguard againſt the ſhot of the Arrows.
And thoſe were placed behinde them who had the
charge of the Engines, being both before and on
both ſides incloſed with armed m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n. The reſt that
ſtood beyond the Engines, being armed themſelves,
defended with Targets ſuch as rowed. The ſame
order was alſo obſerved in thoſe Boats that carried
over the Horſemen. The greater part drew their
Horſes after them by the reins, ſwimming at the
ſtern of the Boats; and ſuch as were carried up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
truſſes filled with ſtraw, were defended by the
Boats that rowed betwixt them and their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> with ſuch men as he had choſen to be
about his Perſon, firſt lanched from the Land, and
directed his courſe to the further ſide. The <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
came againſt them with their Horſemen in
order of Battel, ſtanding upon the brink of the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhore to oppoſe their landing: whoſe ſhew
being a terrour to the <hi>Macedons,</hi> they had alſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cauſe of fear in their paſſing over: For the
Boat-maſters were not able to keep their courſe
againſt the force of the ſtream. And the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
ſwaying to and fro, for the doubt they had to
fall in the water, troubled the Mariners in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their office. By reaſon whereof the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi>
could not have ſcope to caſt their Darts with
any force; taking more care how to place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
out of peril, then to annoy their enemies. Their
Engines ſtood them in great ſtead, which ſeldome
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:46658:169"/>
did ſhoot in vain againſt their Enemies that ſtood
thick before them, attempting to reſiſt their land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
When the <hi>Scythians</hi> ſaw them near the ſhore,
they did ſhoot an infinite number of Arrows into
the Boats, ſo that there was not almoſt any Target
that had not many heads ſticking in it. At length
the Boats arrived at the land, then the Target-men
did riſe upon their feet, and having more ſcope and
ſurer footing, threw their Darts more certainly and
with greater force: whereby perceiving their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to ſhrink and rein back their Horſes, they
leaped chearfully unto the land, one exhorting
and encouraging another, and vigorouſly purſued
them, when they ſaw them to fall out of array. By
that time <hi>Alexanders</hi> Horſemen who had aſſembled
themſelves in Troops, brake upon their Enemies,
and put them to great diſorder. In the mean ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
the reſt being defended by them that were
fighting, landed, and prepared themſelves to the
Battel. <hi>Alexander</hi> with the ſtoutneſs of his courage
ſupplied the impotency of his body. His voice
could not be heard when he ſpake and exhorted his
men (the ſcar of his wound not yet cloſed) but all
men might ſee him fighting; wherefore every one
uſed the office of a Captain in giving exhortation
unto his fellows, and ran upon their Enemies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reſpect of their own lives. Then the <hi>Scythians</hi>
could not endure any longer the countenance, the
force, nor the cry of their Enemies; but being all
on Horſeback fled away upon the Spur, whom the
King purſued eighty Furlongs, notwithſtanding that
with great pain he endured his infirmity. When
his heart fainted, he commanded his men that they
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:46658:169"/>
ſhould follow ſtill in the chaſe as long as the day
laſted, and having not ſtrength to ſuſtain any
further travel, he returned into his Camp to reſt
himſelf.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Macedons</hi> in their purſuit paſſed the bounds
of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> in monument of whom there were great
ſtones ſet up of equal diſtance, and high trees whoſe
ſtocks were covered over with Ivy. But no bounds
could be a ſtay to the <hi>Macedons,</hi> being carried for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in their fury; for it was midnight before they
returned again to their Camp, who having killed
many, and taken a great number of priſoners, did
drive before them a thouſand eight hundred Horſes.
There were ſlain of the <hi>Macedons,</hi> threeſcore Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
of the Footmen one hundred, and about one
thouſand hurt. This enterpriſe with the fame of the
Victory falling in ſo good a ſeaſon, kept the greateſt
part of <hi>Aſia</hi> in obedience, which were at the point
to have rebelled. For they believed the <hi>Scythians</hi> to
be invincible; who being vanquiſhed, they judged
no Nation able to withſtand the power of the
<hi>Macedons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Sacans</hi> after this Victory ſent their Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
unto <hi>Alexander,</hi> offering themſelves to come
under his obedience; to the doing whereof, they
were not ſo greatly moved with fear of his Force,
as they were with report of his clemency uſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Scythians,</hi> after he had diſcomfited them:
For he delivered home all the priſoners without
ranſome, to witneſs unto the world, that he made
War with thoſe fierce Nations to ſhew his power
and his vertue, and not for any malice, or to
ſhew his wrath upon them. That was the cauſe
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:46658:170"/>
that he ſo gently received the Embaſſadors of
the <hi>Sacans,</hi> cauſing <hi>Excipinus</hi> to accompany
them, who being in the firſt flower of his youth,
was for that reſpect in great favour and ſamilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
with <hi>Alexander.</hi> In perſonage he reſembled
<hi>Epheſtion,</hi> but inferiour to him in pleaſantneſs of
ſpeech.</p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Alexander</hi> giving order to <hi>Craterus</hi> to
follow him by ſmall journeys with the greater part
of his Army, he himſelf came to the City of <hi>Mara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canda,</hi>
from whence <hi>Spitamenes</hi> who heard of his
coming was fled into <hi>Bactria.</hi> The King therefore
making great journeys four days continually, came
into the place where, under the conduct of <hi>Menede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
he had loſt two thouſand Footmen, and three
hundred Horſemen. He cauſed their bones to be
gathered together, celebrating their Funerals after
their Countrey manner. By that time <hi>Craterus</hi>
with the <hi>Phalanx</hi> was come to the King; and to the
intent he might puniſh with the Sword all ſuch as
had rebelled, he divided his power into divers parts,
commanding them to burn in every place where
they marched, and to kill all the children.</p>
            <p>The Countrey of the <hi>Sogdians</hi> for the moſt part
is waſte, by reaſon of the great deſarts that ſtretch
overthwart the Countrey. The River called <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litimetum</hi>
paſſeth almoſt through the length of it,
and runneth a ſpace violently in a narrow channel,
and then is received into a hole of the Earth; from
whence it paſſeth underneath the ground, the courſe
of it being manifeſt by the noiſe of the water that
may be hear; and yet on all the ground under which
ſo great a River doth run, there doth not appear any
moiſture put forth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:46658:170"/>
               <hi>Of the Captives that were taken among the</hi>
Sogdians, <hi>there were thirty of the moſt Noble
brought to</hi> Alexander; <hi>who, underſtanding by an
Interpreter, that by the Kings commandment they
ſhould be put to Execution, began as men in mirth
to ſing and dance; and by a certain wanton moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their bodies, expreſſed a great joyfulneſs of
the minde.</hi> Alexander <hi>marvelling that they took
their death with ſuch ſtoutneſs and magnanimity
of heart, called them unto him, enquiring why they
expreſſed ſo great a joy when they had death before
their face? They anſwered,</hi> That if they had been
put to death by any, except by ſuch a one as he
was, they ſhould have taken their death ſorrowfully:
But now ſeeing they ſhould be reſtored to their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours
by a King that was Conquerour of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they rejoyced in their honeſt death, as the
thing all men ſhould wiſh and deſire. <hi>The King
then marvelling at their magnanimity;</hi> I enquire of
you (<hi>quoth he</hi>) if you can be content to live, and
become Friends to him, by whoſe benefit you ſhall
receive life? <hi>They ſaid,</hi> That as they never were his
Enemies, but as they were provoked by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Wars, even ſo if he would make an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them rather by a benefit then an injury,
they would labour not to be overcome in good will,
nor in doing any thing that pertained to their duty.
He asked what pledge they would give of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe?
<hi>They anſwered,</hi> Their Lives they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ſhould be their Pledges, ready to be yielded
again when it was required. <hi>Therein they brake
no promiſe; for ſuch as returned home into their
Countreys, kept the people in good obedience:
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:46658:171"/>
And four of them that were appointed to be of the
Kings Guard, gave place to none of the</hi> Macedons <hi>in
love or affection towards their Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he had ordered all things among the <hi>Sog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
he left <hi>Peucolaus</hi> there with three thouſand
men of War, and removed into <hi>Bactria;</hi> from whence
he commanded <hi>Beſſus</hi> to be carried to <hi>Ecbatana,</hi> there
to ſuffer death for the killing of <hi>Darius.</hi> About
the ſame time <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> and <hi>Menidas</hi> brought three
thouſand Footmen, and a thouſand Horſemen of
mercenary Souldiers; and one <hi>Alexander</hi> came to
him out of <hi>Lycia</hi> with three thouſand Footmen, and
five hundred Horſemen. <hi>Aſclepiodorus</hi> had levied
the like number out of <hi>Syria. Antipater</hi> ſent eight
thouſand <hi>Greeks;</hi> amongſt whom there were five
hundred Horſemen. When he had thus recruited
his Army, he went about in every place to quiet
thoſe ſtirs that had been raiſed up by the Rebellion;
and having ſlain them that were the Authors and
Beginners thereof, the fourth day he came to the
River of <hi>Oxus,</hi> which being a water unwholſome
to be drunk (becauſe it is troubled and full of
mud) the <hi>Macedons</hi> fell to digging of Wells;
and when by digging deep they could finde no
water, a Spring ſuddenly appeared in the Kings
Tent; which, becauſe it was not found at the
firſt, they feigned it to come by miracle. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the King was well pleaſed, and contented men
ſhould believe that the ſame was ſent by the gift of
God.</p>
            <p>When he had paſſed the Rivers of <hi>Ochus</hi> and <hi>Oxus,</hi>
they came unto a City called <hi>Marginia,</hi> near unto
the which he choſe out places for the building of ſix
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:46658:171"/>
Towns; whereof he planted two towards the
South, and four towards the Eaſt; every one diſtant
not far from another; to the intent, that their
mutual aſſiſtance in time of need ſhould not be far to
ſeek. They were all ſcituate upon high hills, as bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
to keep under thoſe wilde Nations: But now
they have forgotten their original, and are ſubject
to thoſe they were wont to rule.</p>
            <p>The King having ſubdued all the Country, one
Rock only remained, which <hi>Arimazes</hi> a <hi>Sogdian</hi>
had taken with thirty thouſand armed men, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
the ſame with Victuals for two years. The
ſame Rock was thirty furlongs in height, and an
hundred and fifty in compaſs, being in all parts
ſteep and broken, having one ſtreight path only to
paſs up unto it. In the mid way to the top, it had
a cave, which was narrow and dark in the entry,
but by little and little it waxed wider, and had
more lodgings within for a great multitude, and
was beſides ſo full of Springs, that when they
met together, they ran down the Rock like a great
River.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> beholding the ſtrength of this place,
and the difficulty to win it, determined to depart
from thence: But there entred ſuddenly into his
heart a deſire to weary Nature, and to work againſt
her power. Yet before he would attempt the
fortune of any Siege, he ſent <hi>Cophes</hi> the Son of
<hi>Artabaſus,</hi> to perſwade them to ſurrender it. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimazes,</hi>
upon truſt of the ſtrength of the place,
anſwered in all things arrogantly, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in that he asked if <hi>Alexander</hi> could flie?
Which words being reported to the King, did
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:46658:172"/>
put him in ſuch a fury, that ſtraightways he
called for ſuch as he uſed to conſult withal, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the pride and preſumption of <hi>Arimazeus,</hi>
and after what manner he had ſcorned him. <hi>But
ſhortly</hi> (he ſaid) <hi>he would deviſe ſuch a Policy,
that he would make him think that the</hi> Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
<hi>had wings:</hi> He commanded therefore that
out of the whole Army they ſhould chuſe out
and bring to him three hundred of the moſt light
young men had been accuſtomed to drive beaſts
amongſt the Rocks, and ſtreight paths of the
Mountains: whereupon they brought ſuch to the
King, as both for lightneſs of body, and hardineſs
of heart were moſt meet for that purpoſe; unto
whom he ſaid:</p>
            <p>My Fellows of mine own Age, with you have I won
Cities that were counted inexpugnable, and have
paſſed the tops of Mountains covered continually with
Snow. With you I have gone through the ſtreights
of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and have without wearineſs ſuſtained the
violence of the cold, whereby I have experience of
you, and you of me. The Rock you ſee hath but one
entry, which our Enemies do obſerve, the reſt they
neglect. They keep no Watch but towards our Camp.
If you diligently ſearch, you ſhall find ſome way to
bring you to the top. Nature hath made nothing ſo
high, but that it may be attained to by the induſtry
of man. In putting things in proof, whereof others
have deſpaired, we have gotten <hi>Aſia</hi> into our poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
contrive you the means to get up unto the top,
which when you have taken, you ſhall give a token to
me by ſetting up ſome white Cloath. You ſhall ſee
me then come forwards with my power, and turn the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:46658:172"/>
Enemies from you towards me. He ſhall have ten
Talents for a reward, who doth recover the top firſt;
and he that getteth up next ſhall have one leſs; and
the like order ſhall be obſerved with Ten of the firſt.
I am aſſured you regard not ſo much my liberalitie as
my favour.</p>
            <p>When they had heard the King ſpeak after
that manner, they imagined the thing done; and
departing out of his preſence, they prepared
ſtrong Ropes and iron Hooks, which they faſtened
to the Rocks, and ſo climbed up. The King
brought them about the Rock, whereas it ſeemed
leaſt ſteep and moſt plain to mount upon, and
in the ſecond Watch willed them to paſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
with good ſpeed. They being furniſhed
with two days Victuals, and armed only with
Swords and Spears, at firſt went forwards with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any great difficulty; but when they came to
the ſteepneſs of the Rock, ſome took hold of the
broken crags to lift up themſelves, and ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening
their Hooks on the Rocks, climbed up
by the Ropes: They were compelled to reſt and ſtay
divers times, and ſo conſumed that day in travel
and fear.</p>
            <p>When they had paſſed many difficult places,
further labours appeared, the height of the Rock
ſeeming to grow more and more. When they
failed either of their hold or of their footing, it
was a miſerable thing to ſee how they fell down
headlong, ſhewing by their miſ-fortune, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
to others what was likely to come of them.
Notwithſtanding at length, through all theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
they got up unto the top, where wearied
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:46658:173"/>
with the travel of their continual labour, and
ſome with the hurts and maims they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
they ſlept all that night amongſt the wild
and rough Rocks, unmindful of the peril they
were in.</p>
            <p>When it was day, they awaked out of their deep
ſleep, and beholding the valleys underneath them,
they were ignorant in what part of the Rock ſo
great a multitude of their Enemies ſhould lie. But
at length, when they perceived by the ſmoke in what
place they were, they upon the points of two ſpears
ſet up the ſigne that was appointed them, and found
that in their coming up they had loſt two and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The King being careful not ſo much for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
he had to win the Rocks, as to ſave thoſe whom
he had expoſed to ſo manifeſt a danger, ſtood all
day beholding the top of the Mountain; and when
the darkneſs of the night took away the proſpect
of the eyes, he departed to refreſh his body. The
next day before it was full light, he perceived the
white Cloth ſet up on the top of the Rock; but
the variety of the Air, the Sun beginning to ariſe,
and yet clouded, cauſed him to doubt a while
whether his ſight had failed him or not. But when
it was full and open day, it was manifeſtly appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
and all doubt was removed. Then he called
<hi>Cophes,</hi> by whom he had attempted their mindes
before, willing him once again to exhort them to
be better adviſed; and if ſo be that in the truſt of
their ſtrength, they would not ſubmit themſelves,
that then he ſhould ſhew to them thoſe Souldiers
that had taken the Rock over their heads. When
<hi>Cophes</hi> came thither, he began to perſwade <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazes</hi>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:46658:173"/>
to give up his ſtrength, thereby to win the
Kings favour; and not inforce <hi>Alexander</hi> to ſtay in
the Siege of a Rock, having ſo many weighty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
in hand: But he found him more obſtinate and
proud then he did before, and willed <hi>Cophes</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
and move him no more on that ſubject.
Then he took <hi>Arimazes</hi> by the hand, and required
him to go with him out of the Cave: When they
were come where they might look about, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him thoſe that were gotten to the top of the
Rock; and ſcorning then his pride, he asked of
him, whether <hi>Alexanders</hi> Souldiers had gotten wings
or no?</p>
            <p>By that time the Trumpets were blown in the
<hi>Macedons</hi> Camp, they might hear the Alarm that
was made in the Army, which, as many vain and
trifling things are wont in the Wars to grow to
great effect, ſo it was the cauſe that they yeilded
themſelves; for fear ſo troubled them, that they
could not conſider the ſmall number that were
over their heads, but called <hi>Cophes</hi> again in great
haſte, who was departed away, and ſent with him
unto <hi>Alexander</hi> thirty of the chief men, authorized
to yeild up the Rock, with compoſition to depart in
ſafety.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Alexander,</hi> notwithſtanding that he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
leſt his Enemies diſcovering the fewneſs of his
men, might put them to diſtreſs; yet truſting in
the felicity of his own Fortune, and offended
with the pride of <hi>Arimazes,</hi> would agree to no
condition, but that they ſhould yeild ſimply. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimazes</hi>
thereupon deſpairing more of his ſtate,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:46658:174"/>
then he had cauſe, deſcended down to the Camp
with the chiefeſt of the Nation that were of Kin to
him: All whom <hi>Alexander</hi> cauſed to be ſcourged
with Rods, and then to be crucified at the foot of
the Rock. The multitude that yielded, with the
money that there was taken, were given in gift to
the Inhabitants of the new Cities; and the Rule of
the ſaid Rock was committed unto <hi>Artabaſus,</hi> with
the Charge of the Country thereabouts.</p>

Fame then Glory, becauſe his Enemies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in no place certain, it was neceſſary for him
to ſeparate his Power; and ſo he divided his Army
into three parts: He gave the Charge of the one
part to <hi>Epheſtion,</hi> to <hi>Cenon</hi> the other, and took the
third part unto himſelf. His Enemies were not all
of one Opinion; for ſome of them ſeeing their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
could not avail, yielded themſelves before
the Fight; to whom he gave the Cities and the
Lands of thoſe that continued ſtill his Enemies.</p>
            <p>But the Outlawries of <hi>Bactria,</hi> with eight hundred
Horſemen, waſted the Villages of the <hi>Maſſagetes:</hi>
For the redreſs whereof, <hi>Attinas,</hi> Governour of that
Country, went againſt them with three hundred
Horſemen, not knowing that his Enemies lay in
wait for him; who planting their Ambuſhment in
a Wood joyning to a great Plain, had appointed
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:46658:175"/>
ſome men to drive Cattel, thereby to draw their
Enemies, with the greedineſs of the prey, within
danger of the Ambuſh. When the Souldiers of <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinas</hi>
ſaw the Drivers of the Cattel, they purſued
them without order; ſo that when they were paſſed
the Wood, where the Ambuſhment lay, their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
brake out upon them (not fearing any ſuch
danger) and ſlew them every one.</p>
            <p>The fame of this Overthrow came immediately
to <hi>Craterus,</hi> who drew thither with the Horſemen:
But the <hi>Maſſagetes</hi> being fled before his coming, he
flew a thouſand of the <hi>Dahans</hi> that took their
part, whereby the Rebellion of all the Country
ceaſed. Thus <hi>Alexander</hi> having ſubdued the <hi>Sog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
returned to <hi>Maracanda,</hi> whither <hi>Berdes</hi>
(whom he had ſent to the <hi>Scythians</hi> inhabiting
about <hi>Boſphorus)</hi> came to him with Embaſſadours
of that Country. <hi>Phratarus</hi> alſo, who had the
chief Rule of the <hi>Maſſagetes</hi> and <hi>Dahans</hi> (which
Nations were joyned by Affinity together) ſent cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Meſſengers to <hi>Alexander,</hi> offering to be at his
Commandment. The <hi>Scythian</hi> Embaſſadours made
requeſt, that <hi>Alexander</hi> would marry their Kings
Daughter; and if the Affinity pleaſed him, that
he would ſuffer the Princes of the <hi>Macedons</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into Marriage likewiſe with the Noble-mens
Daughters of their Country, promiſing that the
King ſhould come in perſon to viſit him. He heard
gently both the Embaſſages, and ſtill continued
in that place, till <hi>Epheſtion</hi> and <hi>Artabaſus</hi> came
unto him; and then joyning his Power again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
he advanced into the Country that is called
<hi>Baxaria.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:46658:175"/>
There is nothing more eſteemed in that Nation,
then to have great Droves of wilde Beaſts incloſed in
Parks, which are very pleaſant, and full of Springs:
Thoſe Parks are incloſed in Walls, and Towers
builded within them, to be Lodges for the Hunters.
There was one Park in that Country, that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
unhunted, during the time of four mens
Ages, into which <hi>Alexander</hi> entered with his whole
Army, chaſing the wilde Beaſts in every quarter.
Amongſt the reſt, there was a Lyon of a vaſt bulk
that came running towards <hi>Alexander,</hi> which when
<hi>Lyſimachus</hi> (who afterwards was King, ſtanding
next to <hi>Alexander)</hi> perceived, he ſtepped before
him, to receive the Lyon with his Hunting Spear:
But <hi>Alexander</hi> plucked him back, and willed him
to withdraw, ſaying, <hi>That he was able to kill a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as well as</hi> Lyſimachus. For you are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that this <hi>Lyſimachus,</hi> on a time hunting in
<hi>Syria,</hi> killed by himſelf alone an huge Lyon; but
yet he was torn to the very bones under the left
ſhoulder, and put in great danger of his life; which
being that which <hi>Alexander</hi> meant, he performed
with his Sword no leſs then he promiſed; for he did
not only receive the Lyon, but killed him with one
ſtroke: Thereupon the Fable did riſe, how <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
ſhould have caſt <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> to a Lyon.</p>
            <p>But though <hi>Alexander</hi> his chance was good here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
yet the <hi>Macedons</hi> knew, that by the Cuſtom of
his Country, he ſhould not have hunted on Foot
without the chiefeſt of his Nobility and Friends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him. He killed within that Park four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
wilde Beaſts, and there did feaſt his Army, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
afterwards to <hi>Maracanda.</hi>

               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:46658:176"/>
               <hi>Artabaſus</hi> there excuſing himſelf by his Age, that
he was unapt for the Rule of that Country, <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
committed the ſame to <hi>Clitus,</hi> being the man
that defended him with his Target, when he was
fighting bare-headed at the River of <hi>Granike,</hi> and
there cut off <hi>Rhoſaceris</hi> hand, that was in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to ſtrike the King: He was an old Souldier
to <hi>Philip</hi> his Father, and notable by many feats of
War that he had done: <hi>Hellanice,</hi> his Siſter, was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexanders</hi>
Nurſe, whom he loved no leſs then his
own Mother: For theſe cauſes, he committed the
ſtrongeſt part of his Empire to his fidelity. The
King that purpoſed to ſet forward his journey the
next day, made the ſame night a Solemn Banquet,
wherein (being too great a Boaſter of himſelf)
when he was hot with Wine, he began to ſet forth
the Acts that he had done, in ſuch ſort, that his
words offended the ears of ſuch as knew them to be
true.</p>
            <p>The Ancient Men kept ſilence, until ſuch time as
he began to deface the Acts of <hi>Philip</hi> his Father,
vaunting the notable Victory of <hi>Cheroneſe</hi> to be his
own deed, the glory whereof (he ſaid) was taken
from him by the malice and envy of his Father:
For he alledged, how in the Mutiny which roſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Macedons</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi> Souldiers, when
<hi>Philip</hi> lay hurt of a wound which he received at
a Fray, and thought he could be no otherwiſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
then to counterfeit himſelf to be dead, he
defended his body with his Buckler, and ſlew them
with his own hand, who ran upon his Father to have
killed him; which act (he ſaid) his Father never
gladly would confeſs, nor ever could abide to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:46658:176"/>
his ſafeguard to come by his Son. He
alſo declared, how after the journey he made by
himſelf into <hi>Illyria,</hi> in writing unto his Father, he
did aſcribe the Victory unto himſelf, having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
his Enemies when he was away. He ſaid,
that in his Opinion it deſerved but ſmall commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
to make a journey into <hi>Samothracia,</hi> when
<hi>Aſia</hi> ought to have been ſpoiled and burnt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor
he thought no man worthy of praiſe indeed, but
ſuch as do ſo great Acts, as may exceed all mens
credit.</p>
            <p>The young men that were preſent, were glad to
hear theſe words, and ſuch other like; but they
were ungrateful to the Ancient, eſpecially for <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>'s
ſake, under whom they had long ſerved. Then
<hi>Clitus,</hi> who likewiſe was not very ſober, turned to
ſuch as were beneath him, rehearſing ſome verſes of
<hi>Eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ipides,</hi> whereof the King might rather hear the
found then the words: The effect of them was;
<hi>That the</hi> Greeks <hi>did evil, who in the Monuments
of their Victories, did ſubſcribe only the Names of
their Kings, who uſurped that Glory unto themſelves,
which other men did win by ſhedding of their own
blood. Alexander</hi> therefore judging his words to
have been worſe then they were, inquired of ſuch
as were next him, what <hi>Clitus</hi> ſaid: But when they
kept ſilence, <hi>Clitus</hi> with a louder voice, rehearſed
in order <hi>Philip</hi>'s Acts, and the Wars he made in
<hi>Greece,</hi> preferring them before any Acts done ſince
that time: Whereupon there did riſe a confuſion
between the young men and the old. But the King
inforcing a patience himſelf, when he heard <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
deface his praiſe, conceived a wonderful wrath
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:46658:177"/>
in his minde: Yet it ſeemed that he would have
bridled his paſſion, if <hi>Clitus</hi> would have made an
end of his preſumptuous talk. But when he would
not ceaſe, he gave occaſion to <hi>Alexander</hi> to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
moved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clitus</hi> then did proceed ſo far forth, that he
durſt defend <hi>Parmenio</hi> his caſe, and preferred the
Victory that <hi>Philip</hi> won of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> before the
deſtruction of <hi>Thebes:</hi> And going further and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
not only through drunkenneſs, but even by
a frowardneſs of a contentious minde, at length
he ſaid:</p>
            <p>If we muſt die for thee, <hi>Clitus</hi> is not the firſt; for
they receive greater rewards of thy Victory, that can
moſt ſhamefully deface thy Fathers memory. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of the <hi>Sogdians</hi> is given unto me, that hath ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
rebelled; and now is not only unſubdued, but ſuch
a one as by no means can be brought to ſubjection: I am
placed among thoſe wilde Beaſts that be of ſo uncivil a
diſpoſition. But I could paſs over things pertaining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my ſelf, if the Souldiers of <hi>Philip</hi> were not deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
forgetting, that if the old <hi>Atharias</hi> had not turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
again the young men, when they gave over the fight,
we had yet ſticked about <hi>Alicarnazus:</hi> How is it then
that <hi>Aſia</hi> is conquered with theſe young men? But I
ſee it is true what your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle ſaid in <hi>Italy;</hi> He chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
upon Men, and you upon Women.</p>
            <p>There was nothing that <hi>Clitus</hi> ſpake or did in his
raſhneſs, that moved more the King, then the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
mention made of <hi>Parmenio:</hi> Yet for all
that he concealed his grief, and did no more but
command him to avoid out of the place, and ſpake
no other words, ſaving that he ſaid: <hi>If thou talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:46658:177"/>
a little longer, I think thou wilt upbraid me with
the ſaving of his life, whereof in very deed he would
often advance himſelf.</hi> But notwithſtanding that
the King had willed him to depart, yet tarried he
ſtill, and would not riſe: and therefore ſuch as ſate
next him, took him by the arms, and led him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
blaming him, and giving him exhortation to
uſe better words. When <hi>Clitus</hi> ſaw himſelf drawn
forth againſt his will, anger was added to his drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs,
and he then declared aloud, <hi>That it was he
who with his Breaſt defended the Kings Back; but now
when the good ſervice was paſt, the very memory of
the Benefit was hated:</hi> And therewith he laid to his
Charge the death of <hi>Attalus,</hi> and how he mocked
the Oracle of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> whom <hi>Alexander</hi> claimed to
be his Father, and ſaid, that he told him better
truth then his Father did.</p>
            <p>At thoſe words the King was ſtirred unto ſo
much paſſion, as he could ſcarcely have born being
ſober: But having his ſenſes overcome with drink,
he roſe ſuddenly from the Table. His Friends were
amazed, and throwing down the Cups for haſte,
roſe to expect the end of what they ſaw him go
about in ſo much fury: He took a Spear out of the
hand of one of his Guard, and would have ſtricken
<hi>Clitus,</hi> as yet raging with the intemperance of his
tongue; but he was ſtopped by <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicas,</hi>
who took him in their arms, and ſtayed him
for all his ſtriving; and <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> and <hi>Leonatus</hi>
took away the Spear. Then he called out to his
Guard for aid, crying out, that he was taken by his
next Friends, as <hi>Darius</hi> was of late; and willed the
Trumpet to be blown, that the armed men might
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:46658:178"/>
aſſemble unto the Court: Then <hi>Perdicas</hi> and <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomeus</hi>
fell down upon their knees, requiring him
that he would not perſevere in his wrath, which he
ſo ſuddenly had conceived, but rather reſpite his
diſpleaſure, ſeeing that he might the next day
much better order the buſineſs. But his wrath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
ſo much, that his ears were ſhut up from
all counſel, and he ran in a fury amongſt his
Guard, plucking a Spear out of one of their hands;
which once got, he ſtood in the Entry through
the which they muſt needs paſs that ſupped with
him.</p>
            <p>When all the reſt were come forth, <hi>Clitus</hi> came
forth without light; and becauſe <hi>Alexander</hi> could
not diſcern him, he asked who he was? But that
was done ſo terribly, that the cruelty of the act he
went about, appeared in his voice. But <hi>Clitus</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King in a fury, had no reſpect how much
he had offended him before, but made anſwer, <hi>that
he was</hi> Clitus, who was coming from the Kings
Banquet: With that word he ſtrake him through
the body, ſo that he fell down ſtark dead, and
<hi>Alexander</hi> was all beſprinkled with his blood: <hi>Go
now</hi> (quoth he) <hi>to</hi> Philip, Parmenio, <hi>and</hi> Attalus.
Herein it may be ſeen, that Nature provided evil
in the diſpoſition of man, who, for the moſt part,
cannot conſider ſo well the things to come, as thoſe
that be paſt: For after that <hi>Alexanders</hi> ire was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaged,
and his drunkenneſs paſt, weighing advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
the foulneſs of the act he had done; he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
then, that though <hi>Clitus</hi> had uſed over-much
liberty in his talk, yet he ought not to have ſlain
ſo Noble a Man of War; yea, and the ſaver of his
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:46658:178"/>
own life, though he was aſhamed to confeſs it: He
ſaw that he, being a King, had uſed the deteſtable
Office of an Executioner, in revenging with wicked
ſlaughter the liberty of words, which might have
been imputed unto Wine. When he beheld the
blood of him, whom a little before he had bidden
to his Banquet, to run over all the Entry; and that
the Guard were ſo aſtonied and amazed, that they
ſtood afar off, and durſt not come near; his Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarineſs
cauſed his Repentance to be the greater:
Then he plucked the Spear out of the dead Corpſe,
and would have thruſt it into his own body, if the
Guard had not come, and with great ſtriving, wrung
the ſame out of his hands. That done, they took
him up, and carried him into his Lodging, where
he fell down flat upon the ground, filling all the
Court full of the terrible noiſe of his lamentation:
He tare his Face with his Nails, and required ſuch as
were about him, that they would not ſuffer him to
live in ſuch a ſhame and diſhonour. In theſe requeſts
he conſumed the whole night, and cauſed a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
ſearch to be made, whether it were the anger of
the gods or no, that had cauſed him to commit ſo
hainous an act. At length it was found, that the
yearly Sacrifice, due unto <hi>Bacchus,</hi> was not celebrated
in the fit time: and therefore it appeared mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly,
that it ſhould be the wrath of the gods that
had moved him to commit Murther upon eating
and drinking. But the greateſt thing that increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
his ſorrow, was the amazement of his friends,
when he ſaw them ſhrink from him, and that none
of them, after that deed, would gladly uſe ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
communication as they did before. Then he
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:46658:179"/>
perceived that he ſhould live as a wilde Beaſt in a
Deſart, both frighting others, being alſo afraid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
The next morning he commanded the Body,
bloudy as it was, to be brought into his Chamber;
which when he ſaw lying before him, he fell on
weeping, and ſaid:</p>
            <p>Shall I thus requite my Nurſe, whoſe two Sons were
ſlain for my ſake at <hi>Miletum,</hi> by the killing of her
Brother (that was her only Joy) at mine own Board?
What refuge ſhall that wretched Woman have? I
was all the comfort that did remain to her, and now
ſhe ſhall never with joy behold me. Shall I, the
wicked Killer of my Preſervers, return into my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
when I ſhall not be able to preſent my hand unto
my Nurſe, without the remembrance of her miſery
and ſhame?</p>
            <p>When he could put no end to theſe complaints,
the Body was taken away, by the appointment of
his Friends. After he had ſtayed three days ſhut
up in his Chamber, ſorrowing after this manner,
the Squires, and ſuch as had the keeping of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
ſeeing him given obſtinately to death, brake
into his Lodging, and with great pain brought him
(though he long withſtood their prayers) to take at
length ſome relief and ſuſtenance: and to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
he ſhould be the leſs ſhamed of <hi>Clitus</hi> death,
the <hi>Macedons</hi> decreed, that he was lawfully killed;
and would not ſuffer him to be buried, but that the
King commanded it.</p>
            <p>Having conſumed ten days at <hi>Maracanda,</hi> ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to confirm the grief he had conceived at
<hi>Clitus</hi> death, he ſent <hi>Epheſtion,</hi> with part of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
into <hi>Bactria,</hi> to provide Victuals againſt Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:46658:179"/>
and committed the ſame Province unto <hi>Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,</hi>
which before he had given to <hi>Clitus.</hi> From
thence he marched into a Country called <hi>Zenip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa,</hi>
that confineth on the <hi>Scythians;</hi> which being
well inhabited, and full of Villages, doth with
the plentifulneſs thereof, not only detain the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
to dwell there ſtill, but alſo inviteth ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to come amongſt them. The ſame was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
to the Outlaws of <hi>Bactria,</hi> that ſtill rebelled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But after <hi>Alexanders</hi> coming was known, they
were driven forth by the Country-men, and two
thouſand and two hundred of their Horſemen
(which were accuſtomed to live by Theft and
Spoil in time of Peace, made worſe not only by
the War, but alſo by deſpair of forgiveneſs, and
their wilde diſpoſitions) did give an On-ſet ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon <hi>Amintas,</hi> who was <hi>Darius</hi> Lieutenant. The
Battel was long doubtful betwixt them; but final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they loſt ſeven hundred of their number, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
three hundred were taken priſoners, and turned
their backs to the Victors, not without revenge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for they flew of them fourſcore, beſides three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fifty that they wounded; and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
after this ſecond Rebellion, they
obtained pardon. When <hi>Alexander</hi> had brought
them to his obedience, he came with his whole
Army into a Country called <hi>Naura,</hi> the Lord
whereof was called <hi>Siſimethres,</hi> who had two Sons
by his own Mother, it being lawful there for the
Parents to have the Carnal Knowledge of their
Children.</p>
            <p>The ſame <hi>Siſimethres,</hi> with 2000 armed men,
fortified and kept the Straight at the entry of the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:46658:180"/>
Country, where it was moſt narrow. The paſſage
was defended both with a River and a Rock,
through the which Rock the way was made by force
of hands: The light is received in at the Entry, but
further inward there is none, but only ſuch as men
bring with them. From this Rock there goeth a
Vault underneath the ground, that hath iſſue into
the Fields, which is not known but to ſuch as are
of the ſame Country. Though this ſtraight was
naturally ſtrong, and defended beſides by a ſtrong
Power, it withheld not <hi>Alexander</hi> to attempt it,
who brought Engines, which they call <hi>Arietes,</hi> to
beat down their Fortification; and with Slings, and
ſhot of Arrows, did force his Enemies from the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of their defence.</p>
            <p>When he had driven them away, he paſſed
through the Works he had won, and made approach
to the Rock; but the Stream that grew out of the
force of united waters, falling from the Mountain,
was an impediment to him therein: It ſeemed a
wonderful work to fill the Chanel of the River,
yet he cauſed Trees and Stones to be brought to
the place. When his Enemies, that never had ſeen
any ſuch thing before, beheld the Work ſuddenly
to riſe like a Mountain, they were put into a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
fear; by which the King ſuppoſing they
might have been brought to render it up, ſent one
<hi>Oxiartes,</hi> of the ſame Nation, to perſwade <hi>Siſimethres</hi>
to render the Rock; and in the mean ſeaſon, to put
them in more terrour, he cauſed Towers of Wood
to be brought forwards, and did ſhoot from the
Engines with ſuch violence out of the ſame, that
the Enemies forſaking all other ſtrengths, retired
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:46658:180"/>
into the top of the Rock. <hi>Oxiartes</hi> finding <hi>Siſime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thres</hi>
in this fear, perſwaded him rather to prove
<hi>Alexanders</hi> Benevolence then his Power; and ſeeing
that all Creatures ſubmitted to him, that he alone
ſhould not be his hinderance, marching now with
his Victorious Army into <hi>India,</hi> whereby he ſhould
turn other mens plagues upon his own neck. <hi>Siſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>methres</hi>
would have been contented to follow his
advice, but that ſhe who was both his Mother and
his Wife affirmed, how ſhe would rather die, then
commit her ſelf into any mans hand: and therefore
he being aſhamed that the love of Liberty ſhould
remain more in a Woman, then in him being a
Man, he altered his purpoſe, taking that way which
was more honeſt then ſure; and diſmiſſing him that
was the Mediator for Peace, he determined utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to abide the extremity of the Siege. Yet when
he had well weighed his Enemies Power, and his
own together, he began again to repent him of his
Wives Counſel, it being more raſh then profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and made ſuit, that <hi>Oxiartes</hi> would return,
proffering then to commit himſelf to the Kings
Will, only requiring of <hi>Oxiartes,</hi> that he would
not utter his Wives Opinion, for fear leſt that he
ſhould not obtain her pardon. He ſent therefore
<hi>Oxiartes</hi> before, and he came after, with his Wife,
his Children, and all his Kinsfolk, without tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for any aſſurance promiſed to him by <hi>Oxiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.
Alexander</hi> hearing of their approach, ſent his
Horſemen before to cauſe them to ſtay, and to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for his coming: And when he was come to the
place where they did abide, he offered Sacrifice to
<hi>Minerva</hi> and <hi>Victoria,</hi> reſtoring unto <hi>Siſimethres</hi> his
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:46658:181"/>
former Rule and Authority; putting him in hope
of a greater Country, if he would faithfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in his Friendſhip; and took his two Sons,
preſented to him by the Father, to ſerve him in his
Wars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> left his Footmen to ſubdue ſuch as had
not yet yeilded, and went forwards with his Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
into other parts. The way was craggy and
difficult, which at at firſt they indured indifferently,
but afterwards, when their Horſe-hoofs were torn,
and they utterly ſoundred, many were not able to
follow, but rode diſperſed, and out of order, the
wearineſs of their travel ſo much overcame ſhame:
The King notwithſtanding changed often his Horſe,
and purſued, without intermiſſion, his Enemies that
fled before him; by reaſon whereof, all the Noble
young men that were wont to accompany him,
were left behinde, ſaving only <hi>Philip, Lyſimachus</hi>
Brother, who then being in the flower of his youth,
and of great likelihood to become an excellent man,
followed on Foot the King that did ride on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
by the ſpace of fifty furlongs. <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
times, for all that, proffered him his Horſe, but
in no wiſe he would depart from the King, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
that he had his Corſlet on, and all his
Armour.</p>
            <p>When the King paſſed through the Wood where
his Enemies lay in Ambuſhment, he ſought notably,
and protected the Kings perſon, fighting with his
Enemies: But after they were put to flight, and
driven out of the Woods, the greatneſs of his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
which had ſuſtained him in the heat of the
Fight, fainted with his body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and being all on a
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:46658:181"/>
ſweat, he leaned himſelf to a Tree, which could not
ſo much ſtay him, but that he fell to the earth, and
being taken up again by the Kings hands, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after did ſhrink down, and died. The
King being ſorrowful for his death, received ſome
other intelligence, no leſs to be lamented; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he came to his Camp, he was advertiſed of the
death of <hi>Erigius,</hi> one of the moſt Noble of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
whoſe Funerals were celebrated with great
Pomp and Ceremonies of Honour.</p>
            <p>From thence he determined to go unto the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hans,</hi>
where he underſtood that <hi>Spitamenes</hi> was:
But Fortune, that never ceaſed to favour him, did
unexpectedly finiſh that journey of his, as ſhe did
many others. <hi>Spitamenes</hi> was inflamed with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
love to his Wife, whom he carried with him
in all his hazards and adventures: But ſhe that
could not well endure flying, nor to change place
like an Outlaw, became ſo weary of travel, that
by flattery, and fair means, ſhe inticed her Husband
to leave his flight, and go about (ſeeing he ſaw no
ways to eſcape) to procure <hi>Alexanders</hi> favour, of
whoſe Clemency (ſhe ſaid) he had ſeen ſo great
experience. And to move him the more there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
ſhe brought before him the Children begot
betwixt them, making requeſt, that at the leaſt he
would take pity on them; wherein ſhe thought her
prayer would be the more effectual, becauſe <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
was ſo near at hand. But <hi>Spitamenes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
that ſhe did not do this by way of counſel,
but of purpoſe to betray him; and that ſhe deſired
to ſubmit her ſelf to <hi>Alexander,</hi> in confidence of her
Beauty, drew forth his Sword with an intent to have
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:46658:182"/>
killed her, if he had not been withheld by his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
When they would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſuffer him to hurt
her, he commanded her to avoid his ſight, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to kill her if ſhe came again into his preſence;
and to mitigate his love towards her, he conſumed
that night amongſt his Concubi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es: but his love
that was ſo deeply grounded ceaſed not, but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
rather kindled the more toward his Wife:
Wherefore he reconciled himſelf again unto her,
making his continual requeſt, that ſhe would not
counſel or move him any more on that ſubject, but
be content with ſuch chances as fortune would ſend
him; for he eſteemed Death lighter, then to yeild
himſelf. She purged her ſelf of the former per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,
which appeared to her (ſhe ſaid) to have
been good; and though it were out of a womans
frailty, yet it proceeded of a faithful meaning; and
from thenceforth, ſhe ſaid, ſhe was contented to do
as it ſhould pleaſe him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spitamenes</hi> overcome with her counterfeit affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
made a great Feaſt, and after much eating
and drinking, became drowſie, and was carried
into his Chamber. When his Wife perceived him
to be in a deep ſleep, ſhe pulled out a Sword, which
ſhe had kept ſecretly for that purpoſe, and cut off
his head, delivering the ſame, being ſprinkled
with bloud, unto her ſervant that was privy to the
fact; and with him only, as ſhe was imbrued with
the blood, ſhe came unto the <hi>Macedons</hi> Camp,
willing it to be ſignified to <hi>Alexander,</hi> that there
was one come, who had ſomething of importance
to communicate unto him: He by and by gave
Commandment ſhe ſhould enter; but when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:46658:182"/>
her defiled with blood (thinking that ſhe
had come to lament ſome injury done unto her) he
willed her to declare what ſhe would have: She
deſired that her ſervant might come in, from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath
whoſe garment ſhe took <hi>Spitamenes</hi> head,
and preſented it unto <hi>Alexander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The paleneſs of the face wanting blood, had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away the knowledge whoſe face it was; but
when the King perceived it to be a mans head, he
departed forth of the Tent, and by inquiry under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the matter. This brought him into great
perplexity, and he was driven by divers imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
into ſundry opinions; he judged the killing
of ſuch a one (being a Fugitive and a Rebel) to be
a great benefit unto him, who living might have
been a great impediment to his proceedings: But
on the other ſide, conſidering the horribleneſs of
the deed, that ſhe ſhou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d kill him by Treaſon who
loved her ſo intirely, and by whom ſhe had many
Children, the violence of the act overcame the
thanks of benefit, and ſhe was commanded to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
the Camp, leſt the example of ſuch licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
might corrupt the manners and civil diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>Dahans</hi> underſtood of <hi>Spitamenes</hi>
death, they brought <hi>Dataphernes</hi> bound, (this was
he who was Partner with him in his Conſpiracy) and
yeilded themſelves unto <hi>Alexander.</hi> He being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from the greateſt part of his preſent fear,
determined to revenge the injuries of them who
had been miſuſed by the pride and covetouſneſs of
his Deputies and Officers: Therefore he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Hircania,</hi> with the <hi>Cardons</hi> and <hi>Tapirions,</hi> to
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:46658:183"/>
               <hi>Prataphernes,</hi> to whom he gave in Commiſſion, to

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or, to him as a priſoner.
<hi>Tamſonor</hi> was ſubſtituted Ruler of <hi>Caria</hi> in the place
of <hi>Arſamus: Arſaces</hi> was ſent into <hi>Media,</hi> to the
intent that <hi>Oxidates</hi> ſhould remove from thence:
And <hi>Babylon,</hi> upon the death of <hi>Mazeus,</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to <hi>Deditamenes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he had ordained theſe things; the third
moneth he drew his Army out of their Winter-lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to go to a Country that was called <hi>Gabaza.</hi>
The firſt days journey was quiet, and the next not
very tempeſtuous, yet darker then had been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed,
but not without ſome ſignification of their
calamities that were coming: The third day, the
Element was full of Lightning; and when the Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ceaſed, it was very dark; the beholding
thereof did much amaze the Souldiers, and did put
them into a great fear: It thundred, in a manner,
continually, and the Lightning fell in ſtrange ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes,
ſo that the Army ſtood aſtonied, and durſt
neither go forwards, nor remain ſtill in one place.
Then there came ſuddenly a ſhower of Hail driving
like a Tempeſt, which at the firſt they defended
by the coverture of their Armour; but ſhortly after
their hands were ſo cold and wet, that they could
not hold their Weapons, nor yet deviſe which way
to turn themſelves, finding always, where they
turned their faces, more violence of the Tempeſt
then before: Every man therefore broke his array,
wandring about the Woods; and many that were
wearied by fear, rather then by travel, lay down
upon the ground, notwithſtanding that the force
of the Cold had converted the ſhower into a
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:46658:183"/>
Froſt. The Trees, againſt which they leaned, were
a great ſafety and help to many: And yet they
were not ignorant, when they reſted, that they
choſe themſelves a place of death; for when they
left to move their bodies, the natural heat left
them: but caſe was ſo pleaſant to ſuch as were wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
that they refuſed not to die in reſting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
Their affliction was not only vehement
for the time, but alſo continued very long; to the
increaſe whereof, the light, which is a natural
comfort unto men (through the darkneſs of the
ſhower, and the ſhadow of the Wood) was ſo
taken away, that it appeared as if it had been
night.</p>
            <p>The King only was able to endure this miſchief,
who ceaſed not to go about the Army, drawing the
Souldiers together when they were diſperſed, ſitt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them up that lay upon the ground; and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
them, he ſhewed them the Smoak that
aroſe afar off from the Cottages, whither he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
them to draw for ſuccour. There was not
any thing more effectual to their ſafety, then that
whiles they were aſhamed to leave their Prince,
whom they ſaw to indure this miſchief, they chafed
themſelves with their utmoſt labour: But neceſſity
(which in adverſe fortune is of more force then any
reaſon) found out a remedy for this cold: They fell
to cutting down the Wood, making every where
piles and ſtacks thereof, and ſet them on fire: Then
a man would have judged that the whole Wood had
been on a flame, for there was ſcarcely ſpace <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eft
betwixt the fires for men to ſtand: Then their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
joynts began to be moved with the heat, and
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:46658:184"/>
their ſpirits, which were oppreſſed by the force of
the cold, began to have their free recourſe; ſome
recovered the Cottages, which neceſſity cauſed
them to ſeek out in the uttermoſt part of the Wood,
and the reſt recovered the Camp, which was plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a moiſt ground: but by that time the Shower
was ceaſed, the Tempeſt had conſumed one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Souldiers, with Varlets and Slaves. It is ſaid,
that divers were frozen to death, leaning againſt
Trees, and yet ſeemed as though they had been li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and ſpeaking together.</p>
            <p>It chanced that a common Souldier of the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,</hi>
who had much pain to go and carry his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
came at laſt into the Camp where the King
was; who notwithſtanding that he was cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing of
his own body againſt the fire, yet he did riſe out
of his Chair, and pulling off the nummed Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
Armour, who was almoſt paſt his remembrance,
he ſet him down in his Seat: He a great while knew
not where he ſate, or who had received him; but
at length, when his natural heat came to him, and
he perceived it to be his Kings Seat, and the King
to be there preſent, he was afraid, and did ſtart
up again: But <hi>Alexander</hi> beheld him in the face,
and ſaid:</p>
            <p>Perceiveſt thou not now, my Souldier, with how
much better condition thou liveſt, then the <hi>Perſians</hi> do
under their Kings? for it is death to them to ſit in
the Kings Seat, and the ſame hath been the ſafeguard
of thy life</p>
            <p>The next day he called his friends, and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of his Army together, promiſing to reſtore
to them whatſoever they had loſt: wherein he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:46658:184"/>
his promiſe; for <hi>Siſimethres</hi> bringing unto
him many Beaſts of burthen, with 2000 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
and a great number of Sheep and Oxen, he diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
all amongſt the Souldiers; wher in he both
reſtored to them their loſs, and alſo delivered them
from their hunger. The King gave great thanks
unto <hi>Siſimethres;</hi> and commanding his Souldiers
to carry ſix days Victuals ready dreſſed, he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againſt the <hi>Sacans,</hi> where he deſtroyed all their
Country; and of the Booty there taken, he gave
thirty thouſand ſheep in gift to <hi>Siſimethres.</hi> From
thence he came unto a Country belonging to a
Noble Prince called <hi>Cohortanus,</hi> who ſubjected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
unto the King, and he again reſtored his
Country to him, exacting nothing of his, but
that of his three Sons, he ſhould ſend two of them
to ſerve him in his Wars: But <hi>Cohortanus</hi> offer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d

               </gap>d to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of their Country, therein all the pleaſures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſhewed that could be deviſed: Thirty Virgins

               <hi>Alexander,</hi> amongſt whom there was <hi>Cohortanus</hi>

amongſt thoſe Nations) excelled all the reſt: And
notwithſtanding that they were all of excellent
Beauty with whom ſhe was accompanied, yet ſhe
drew all mens eyes towards her, and eſpecially the
Kings, who could not well now govern his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
in ſuch proſperity of fortune, it being an
infirmity which the frailty of man ſeldome can
avoid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="344" facs="tcp:46658:185"/>
Thus he who beheld the Wife of <hi>Darius</hi> and her
two Daughters (to whom <hi>Roxane</hi> was not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable)
with no other deſires then he might have
beheld his Mother, was ſo overcome with the love
of a young Virgin, being but of mean Parentage,
if ſhe ſhould be compared to the Bloud of Kings,
that he affirmed it to be a thing neceſſary for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment
of the Empire, for the <hi>Perſians</hi> and
<hi>Macedons</hi> to marry together, by which only means
ſhame might be taken from the vanquiſhed, and
pride from the Conquerours. He alſo ſhewed a
preſident, how <hi>Achilles</hi> (from whom he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended)
joyned himſelf with a Captive: And
leſt his doings ſhould be counted laſciviouſneſs,
he reſolved to take her to him by the way of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
The Father joyful of this which he looked
not for, gladly confirmed the Kings words; who
in the heat of his deſire, cauſed Bread to be brought
forth, according to the cuſtom of his Country,
the ſame being the moſt Religious Ceremony of
Marriage amongſt the <hi>Macedons:</hi> This Bread was
cut aſunder with a Sword, and each of them
made of it a Sacrifice. It is to be thought, that
ſuch as eſtabliſhed the Cuſtoms of that Nation,
coveted, by a moderate Diet, to ſhew to them
that were the gatherers of great Riches, with
how ſmall a thing they ought to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>Thus he who was both King of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi>
joyned himſelf in Marriage with a Maid brought in
at a Maſque, to beget upon a Captive one that
ſhould Reign over the Victorious <hi>Macedons.</hi> His
friends were aſhamed that he ſhould chuſe, upon
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:46658:185"/>
drink, a Father-in-law among them whom he had
lately ſubdued. But after <hi>Clitus</hi> death, all the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and freedom of ſpeech being taken away,
they ſeemed to agree with their countenances, as
with the moſt apt inſtrument to declare the conſent
of their mindes.</p>
            <p>After this was done, he prepared his journey
towards <hi>India,</hi> purpoſing to viſit the Ocean Sea:
And becauſe he would leave nothing behinde him
that might be an impediment to his expedition, he
took order for thirty thouſand young men to be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied
out of all the Provinces, and to be brought to
him armed, minding to uſe them both as Pledges,
and as Souldiers. He ſent <hi>Craterus</hi> to purſue <hi>Hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanes</hi>
and <hi>Gateues,</hi> of whom the one was taken, and
the other ſlain. <hi>Polipercon</hi> alſo ſubdued the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
that was called <hi>Bubacen;</hi> and having ſet all
things in order, he ſet his whole imagination upon
the War of <hi>India,</hi> which was counted to be a very
rich Country, and to abound both with Gold,
Pearls, and Precious Stones, things appertaining
as much to Voluptuouſneſs as Magnificence; and it
was ſaid, that the Souldiers there had their Targets
made of Ivory, and of Gold: And therefore leſt he
who thought himſelf to excel the reſt, ſhould be
ſurpaſſed in any point, he cauſed his Souldiers to
garniſh their Targets with Plates of Silver, and
the Horſemen to beautifie their Bridles with Gold
and Silver. There were one hundred and twenty
thouſand armed men that followed <hi>Alexander</hi> in the
War.</p>
            <p>When all things were ripe for what he long before
conceived in his evil-diſpoſed minde, he thought it
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:46658:186"/>
time to compaſs how he might uſurp the name and
honour of a god, and ſo willed himſelf not only to
be called, but alſo to be believed to be the Son of
<hi>Jupiter;</hi> as though his power had been as well to
reſtrain mens thoughts, as their tongues: His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
was, that the <hi>Macedons</hi> ſhould fall proſtrate
on the ground, and worſhip him after the ſame
manner that the <hi>Perſians</hi> did their Kings; and to
ſuch his deſire, there wanted not pernicious flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the perpetual poyſon of Princes, whoſe Eſtates
have more often been overcome by flattery, then by
any force of Enemies. The <hi>Macedons</hi> were not in
blame of this, for none of them ſuffered gladly
their Country Cuſtoms to be ſubverted; but it
was the fault of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who with their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
conditions, corrupted the profeſſion of honeſt
Sciences.</p>
            <p>There was one <hi>Hagis</hi> of <hi>Argos,</hi> as evil a Poet as
was ſince <hi>Cherillus</hi> days, and another called <hi>Cleo,</hi>
a <hi>Sicilian,</hi> given to flattery, both by his nature, and
by the Cuſtom of his Country: Theſe, with ſome
other of the dregs and refuſe of their Countries
(whom <hi>Alexander</hi> reputed more then any of his
Captains and Kinſmen) would make it appear to
the world, that Heaven lay open for <hi>Alexander;</hi> and
ſticked not openly to pronounce, that both <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi>
and <hi>Bacchus, Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> ſhould all give
place to his new godhead. For the bringing of
thoſe things to paſs, the King commanded, upon
a ſolemn day, a Feaſt to be prepared with great
pomp, inviting thereunto all the great Lords and
Gentlemen, both of the <hi>Macedons</hi> and the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
with whom when he had ſate and eaten a while, he
departed out of the Feaſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:46658:186"/>
               <hi>Then</hi> Cleo, <hi>as was before-determined, made a
Speech in the praiſe and admiration of the Kings
Vertues, rehearſing his exceeding benefits towards
them all; which to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> he ſaid, there was but
one way, and that was, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> they would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
him a god whom they knew to be one:</hi> For
is it a ſmall thing <hi>(quoth he)</hi> to recompence ſuch
great benefits towards you, with the expence of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Frankincenſe? <hi>He ſhewed the</hi> Perſians <hi>Cuſtom
to be both Religious and Wiſe, in worſhipping their
Kings as gods, thinking their defence and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard,
to conſiſt in the Majeſty of their Prince. He
ſaid,</hi> that <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Bacchus</hi> were Deified, when
they had once overcome the envy of ſuch as lived in
their time; and men that come after, do eaſily believe
ſuch things as have been confirmed by their Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.
If any of you <hi>(quoth he)</hi> will ſtick at this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ye ſhall ſee me the firſt, that at the Kings coming
in, ſhall fall down upon the earth, and worſhip him,
which preſident other men ought to follow, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the men of moſt wiſdom, that ſhould always be
examples to others in doing their duties towards their
Prince.</p>
            <p>His Speech tended directly againſt <hi>Caliſtenes,</hi>
whoſe gravity and prompt liberty of ſpeech was
hateful to the King; for he thought him the man
who only had ſtayed the <hi>Macedons,</hi> that elſe
would readily have done him that honour. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
every mans eyes were faſtened on <hi>Caliſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
who, after ſilence made, ſpake in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</p>
            <p>If the King were preſent (O <hi>Cleo)</hi> to hear theſe thy
words, it ſhould not be needful n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w to anſwer thee;
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:46658:187"/>
for he himſelf would make requeſt, that he might not
thus ſwerve into the cuſtom of Strangers; nor would
he ſuffer that thou ſhouldeſt deface, and bring into the
obloquy and envy of men, with ſuch thy pernicious flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
his Noble Acts, brought to paſs with ſuch courage
and good fortunes: But becauſe he is abſent, I for him
will thus anſwer thee; There is no fruit ſoon ripe, that
will continue long; this I mean by thy divine humours,
which whileſt thou goeſt about to give unto the King,
thou takeſt his Honour from him: There is a time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
that men ſhould believe him to be a god; for
that gift hath always been given to great men, when
they are once dead, by ſuch as came after them: I wiſh
unto the King Immortality after his death, and that
his life may be long, and his Eſtate continual: But
Deifying is a thing that ſometimes doth follow a man,
but it never doth accompany him. Thou didſt rehearſe
examples of the Deifying of <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Bacchus;</hi>
thinkeſt thou that they were made gods upon drink,
and by the degrees of one dinner? The nature of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi>
Mortality muſt be removed from our eyes, before
the ſame can bring him into Heaven. Are not they good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gods <hi>(Cleo)</hi> that thou and I can make? Would the
King (thinkeſt thou) he content to receive of us the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of his godhead? I have a great deſire to prove
thy power: If thou canſt make a god, firſt make a King;
it is much more eaſie to give an earthly Kingdom, then
the poſſeſſion of heaven. Thinkeſt thou <hi>(Cleo)</hi> that the
Immortal gods will hear thee without diſdain, or ſuffer
thoſe thy wicked counſels to take any effect? They would
that we ſhould hold us content with the cuſtoms of our
Forefathers; and for my part I am not aſhamed of my
Country, and deſire not to learn after what manner I
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:46658:187"/>
ſhould honour my Prince; for, in my Opinion, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
him ſufficiently to be both King and Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
of whom we receive Laws to live under.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> was favourably heard of all men, as the
perſon whom they accounted the recoverer of their
Univerſal Liberty. He did not only in this Speech
paint out ſuch flatteries, but alſo lively expreſſed the
Opinion of the <hi>Macedons,</hi> eſpecially of ſuch as were
ancient men, to whom the exchange of old cuſtoms
were grievous. The King was nothing ignorant of
the words that had paſſed between them; for he
ſtood behind a partition of the Hall, and heard all
the diſcourſe: He ſent word therefore to <hi>Hagis</hi> and
<hi>Cleo,</hi> that at his coming in they ſhould move the
Strangers only to fall down, and worſhip him after
their Country cuſtom: And after a while, the King,
as though he had been about ſome buſineſs of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
returned again unto the Feaſt; and then the
<hi>Perſians</hi> fell down, and worſhipped him, after ſuch
ſort as was appointed: but <hi>Polipercon</hi> that ſate above
the King at the Board, asked one in ſcorn, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
touched the ground with his Chin, wherefore
he kiſſed no harder; with which words he moved <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
to ſo much anger, being always impatient of
it, that he ſaid to <hi>Polipercon, Is it thou that diſdaineſt to
honour me? Shall I be mocked of thee alone? Polipercon</hi>
anſwered, <hi>That as it was not ſeemly that a King ſhould
be ſcorned, ſo it was not that a Subject ſhould be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi>
At which words the King plucked him from the
Table, and throwing him down, he ſaid unto him,
falling upon the earth; <hi>Lo, haſt thou not done that
thy ſelf, which before thou didſt ſcorn in another man?</hi>
And thereupon he commanded him to cuſtody, and
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:46658:188"/>
ſo brake up the Feaſt. <hi>Polipercon</hi> being thus puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
was afterwards pardoned; but <hi>Caliſtenes,</hi> whoſe
contempt and ſtubbornneſs the King had long
grudged at, found that the King had more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grounded his diſpleaſure, on whom there chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
ſhortly after an apt occaſion for revenge: It
was a Cuſtom (as it hath been ſaid before) amongſt
the Noble-men of <hi>Macedon,</hi> to put their Sons, when
they were paſt their Childhood, in ſervice to the
King, as Pages, to do neceſſary buſineſs about his
perſon: Their uſage was to watch nightly by
courſe, at the Chamber-door, where the King lay:
The Concubines were by them brought in at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
door, where the Guard watched: They like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
received the Horſes of the Grooms of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and brought them to the King when he mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
They always were about the King, both in
Hunting, and in Battel; and were brought up in the
Studies of Liberal Sciences: The chiefeſt honour
was given unto them, becauſe they did ſit and eat
with the King: None had power to correct them
with ſtripes, but only the King himſelf. This
company was like a ſtore or Seminary, from whence
all the Captains and Governours of the <hi>Macedons</hi>
did proceed. From thence came their latter Kings,
whoſe Lineage the power of the <hi>Romans</hi> long after
did extinguiſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hermolaus,</hi> one of that number, becauſe he had
ſtruck a Bore, (which the King had thought to have
ſtruck himſelf) was by his Commandment beaten
and ſcourged with Rods: which rebuke he took
moſt grievouſly, and complained to <hi>Soſtratus</hi> his
friend, who was one of the ſame company: he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:46658:188"/>
the body torn whereunto he had ſo great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and peradventure for ſome other cauſes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
alſo with the King before, ſo excited <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molaus</hi>
(who was provoked ſufficiently already)
that each gave Faith to other to finde a way to
deſtroy the King: Which they undertook not with
any Childiſh proceeding, but wiſely agreed to bring
<hi>Nicoſtratus, Antipater, Aſclepiodorus,</hi> and <hi>Philotas,</hi>
into the fellowſhip of their Conſpiracy: And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
they joyned them unto <hi>Anticles, Elaptonius,</hi>
and <hi>Ephimanes.</hi> But the way how to perform this
purpoſe ſeemed very difficult, becauſe it behoved
that all of them ſhould watch together: And it was
the cuſtom, that according to their courſes, ſome
watched one night, and ſome another; for if any
other ſhould happen amongſt them, who were not
privy to the Conſpiracy, the ſame might be a let to
the whole Enterpriſe: Therefore about changing
the courſe of their Watch, and in other preparation
for the execution of their Conſpiracy, there paſſed
two and thirty days.</p>
            <p>At length the night came, when the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Conſpirators ſhould watch together, who
rejoyced greatly among themſelves, that each had
kept Faith to other, whereof ſo many days ſilence
had given good proof: during which time, neither
fear nor hope had altered any of their mindes, ſo
great was the diſpleaſure they had conceived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the King, or elſe the fidelity they bore to one
another. They were ſtanding at the door where
the King did ſup, to the intent, that at his riſing
from the Banquet, they might bring him to his
Chamber: But <hi>Alexanders</hi> fortune, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:46658:189"/>
of ſuch as were in his company, moved
him to drink largely; whereby, and by reaſon of
other paſtimes and devices, the time was ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed,
that the Conſpirators ſtood in a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
perplexity: For one while they were glad,
becauſe they truſted to finde him drunk when they
ſhould go about their Enterpriſe; and another while
they were in a great agony, leſt he ſhould ſit till
day-light, for then the cuſtom was to relieve the
Watch, and others to ſucceed in their places; and
becauſe their courſe ſhould not come about again
till the ſeventh night after, they could not be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that every one of them would keep the thing
ſecret till that time. But when the day began to
appear, and <hi>Alexander</hi> was riſen from the Banquet,
they were ſo glad to execute their deſigne, that
they were joyful to receive the King: There was a
Woman accuſtomed to haunt the Court, who being
diſtracted in her minde, and ſeeming by ſome inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to ſhew things to come, met <hi>Alexander,</hi> and
would in no wiſe ſuffer him to paſs, but perſwaded
him by all the means ſhe could deviſe, to return and
ſit down again: He ſaid to her in ſport, <hi>that the
gods gave him good advice;</hi> and thereupon called
back his friends, and ſate drinking till it was two
hours within day; by which time another compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
had relieved the Watch, and were ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Kings Chamber-door; yet for all that, the
Conſpirators remained there ſtill, after the time of
their Watch expired; ſo ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ement is the hope which
mens minds conceive, when they be drowned in the
deſire of great Atchievements.</p>
            <p>The King ſpake more gently to them then he
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:46658:189"/>
was accuſtomed, and willed them to go to reſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they had watched all the night before: and
moreover he gave unto every one of them for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
50 Seſtercies, with commendation that they
continued their watch longer than their time. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus deceived of the great hope they were in,
they departed to their Lodgings, in expectation of
the night when their courſe ſhould come again. But
<hi>Epimanes,</hi> who either by the gentleneſs of the King
ſhewed him amongſt the reſt, or elſe that he thought
the providence of God had withſtood their purpoſe,
ſuddenly changed his minde, and opened the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
to his brother <hi>Eurilochus,</hi> who was not privy to
it before.</p>
            <p>The puniſhment of <hi>Philotas</hi> was ſo freſh in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
mans memory, that <hi>Eurilochus</hi> laid immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hands upon his brother, and brought him into
the Court. He called to the Watch, and told them,
he brought news pertaining to the Kings Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard;
which thing well appeared, as well by
their coming at ſuch a time, as alſo by their ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
which was a teſtimony of their troubled
mindes. The Watchmen called up <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> and
<hi>Leonatus,</hi> that lay within the Kings Chamber;
who ſtraightway brought them to the King,
and wakened him, who by reaſon of his much
drinking lay in a dead ſleep. It was long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re he
awoke, but by little he came to himſelf, and
asked what the matter was. Then ſaid <hi>Eurilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,
Thanked be the gods, that have not utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
determined the ruine of our Family. For
though my Brother intended an hainous Act, yet
he is come to repentance, by him the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:46658:190"/>
is brought to light. The very ſame night Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was conſpired againſt you; The Authors are ſuch
as you would ſcarcely think.</hi> And thereupon <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi>
declared all things in order, with the names
of the Conſpirators.</p>
            <p>It is certain that <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> was not named as
one privy to that Treaſon; but it was confeſſed
that he gladly gave ear to the diſcourſe of others,
when they blamed and ſpake evil of the Kings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.
Some do adde thereunto, that when
<hi>Hermolaus</hi> did complain to <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> how the King
had beaten him, he bad him remember that he was
a man. But whether he ſpake it to take the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in patience, or elſe to ſtir him to further ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
it remaineth in doubt. When the King was
fully awaked, and called to his memory the peril
he was in, he gave <hi>Eurilochus</hi> fifty Talents, with
the forfeit of a rich mans goods called <hi>Tiridates,</hi> and
pardoned his Brother before his pardon was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
He commanded the principals of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to be kept bound, and among them <hi>Caliſthenes;</hi>
who being taken and brought into the Court, the
King ſlept all the day and the night enſuing, he
was ſo heavy with drinking and watching. The
next day he called a great Council, whereat the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Kinsfolk of the Conſpirators were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
not very well aſſured of their own ſafeguard,
becauſe that by the law of the <hi>Macedons</hi> all ought
to die that were of kin to Traytors. All the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators
except <hi>Caliſthenes,</hi> by the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
were brought forth; who immediately
confeſſed the whole Treaſon they had deviſed.
Then every man preſent reviled them; and the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:46658:190"/>
King demanded what he had done to them, that
they ſhould conſpire his death. When all the other
ſtood ſtill and held their peace, <hi>Hermolaus</hi> anſwered
thus:</p>
            <p>Ye demand this thing of us as though you knew not
the matter. We began to kill you, becauſe you began
to reign over us as if we were ſlaves, and not free
born.</p>
            <p>As he was ſpeaking theſe words, his Father <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſepolis</hi>
called him Traytor and Murtherer of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
ſtopping his mouth with his hand, becauſe
he ſhould ſpeak no further. Then the King plucked
his Father back, and willed <hi>Hermolaus</hi> to ſpeak ſuch
things as he had learned of his Maſter <hi>Caliſthenes.</hi>
Then <hi>Hermolaus</hi> proceeded.</p>
            <p>I will uſe your benefit, and declare thoſe things which
I have learned to the great miſchief of us all. How ſmall
is the number of the <hi>Macedons</hi> remaining, that have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped
your cruelty? <hi>Attalus, Philotas, Parmenio,
Linceſtes, Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Clitus,</hi> are now dead:
but to our Enemies behoof they be alive. They ſtood in
the Fight and defended you with their Swords, receiving
wounds for your glory and victory, which now are very
well rewarded. The one beſprinkled your Table with his
bloud, and the other could not be ſuffered to die an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
death. Thus the Captains of your people are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
and put to death; a pleaſant ſpectacle to the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi>
of whom they were Conquerours. <hi>Parmenio,</hi> by
whom you ſlew your Enemy <hi>Attalus,</hi> was put to death
without judgement. Thus uſe you the hands of us
wretches, as inſtruments to kill one another; and ſuch as
even now were to be your Tormentors, ſtraightways you
command to be tormented by others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="356" facs="tcp:46658:191"/>
At thoſe words, the multitude began to ſhout a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Hermolaus,</hi> and his father drew his ſword to
have ſlain him, if he had not been hindred by the
King, who commanded <hi>Hermolaus</hi> to ſpeak, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the reſt to hear him plead for himſelf, who (he
ſaid) enforced the cauſe of his own puniſhment. At
length with great labour they held their peace, and
then <hi>Hermolaus</hi> began again.</p>
            <p>How liberal is he to ſuffer boys to ſpeak, when the
voice of <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> is ſhut up in priſon, becauſe he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
is able to declare himſelf? and why? becauſe he
feareth the free ſpeech of an innocent, and cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to behold his face, and yet I will juſtifie he is not
privy to this matter. But others that are here preſent,
who contrived with me a noble Enterpriſe, of whom
there is not any that can accuſe <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> of conſent;
and yet our ſo patient and ſo righteous a King, hath
determined here his death. Theſe be the rewards of the
<hi>Macedons,</hi> whoſe bloud is diſeſteemed as of no value.
He hath 30000 Mules carrying ſpoil and treaſure, and
yet the poor Souldiers carry nothing with them but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewarded
skars and wounds; all which things we did
eaſily ſuffer before he did betray us to the <hi>Barbarians,</hi>
and by a new trade of conqueſt made us his own Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
Slaves. He alloweth the apparel and diſcipline of the
<hi>Perſians,</hi> and deſpiſeth the manners of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey:
and therefore we determined to kill him, not as
King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> but as King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and as a turn-coat
to be perſecuted by the law of arms. He would have
the <hi>Macedons</hi> kneel to him, and worſhip him as a god.
He refuſed <hi>Philip</hi> for his Father; and if any god had
been before <hi>Jupiter,</hi> he would have refuſed him likewiſe.
Do you marvel if freemen cannot bear this his pride?
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:46658:191"/>
What can we hope for at his hands, ſeeing we muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
die as innocents, or elſe (what is worſe than death)
live and remain in bondage as ſlaves? He is greatly in
my debt, if by this proof he could amend, for he may learn
of me the thing that free hearts cannot endure. Spare
them whoſe age ſhall be ſufficiently tormented with the
loſs of their children: but upon as cauſe execution to
be done, to the intent we may obtain by our own death
the liberty which we ſought for by thine.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Hermolaus</hi> had ſpoken theſe words, the
King anſwered after this manner:</p>
            <p>How falſe theſe things are, which he hath learned of
his Inſtructor, my patience doth declare. For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
he before confeſſed this Treaſon, yet my minde
was that you ſhould hear what he could ſay, knowing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well, that when I give liberty to this Villain to ſpeak,
that he would uſe the ſame rage &amp; fury in his diſcourſe,
which before mov'd him to have kill'd me whom he ought
to have loved as his father. Of late when he uſed a great
preſumption, I commanded him to be chaſtiſed after the
cuſtome of our Countrey uſed by the Kings of <hi>Macedon;</hi>
which chaſtiſement we muſt grant needful to be done, as
the pupils are chaſtiſed by their tutors, and wives by their
husbands, and ſervants by their maſters. This was all the
cruelty I uſed towards him, which he would have reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with murder and Treaſon. But how gentle I am to all
that ſuffer me to uſe mine own diſpoſition, ſince you your
ſelves do know it, it were ſuperfluous for me to rehearſe. I
cannot marvel at all, though puniſhment of traytors be
diſpleaſant to <hi>Hermolaus,</hi> who is himſelf ſo great a
traytor: when he commendeth <hi>Parmenio</hi> and <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,</hi>
it maketh for his own purpoſe. I pardoned <hi>Lyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtes:
Alexander</hi> being accuſed by two witneſſes,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:46658:192"/>
that he twice conſpired Treaſon againſt me; and being
again convicted, yet deferred I his puniſhment two years,
till you your ſelves required he might have his deſert.
Touching <hi>Attalus,</hi> you remember very well how he
wrought Treaſon againſt me before I was King: And
for <hi>Clitus,</hi> I would he had not moved me to wrath,
whoſe raſh tongue ſpeaking the rebuke and ſhame both of
me and you, I ſuffered longer than he would have done
me, ſpeaking the like. The clemency of Kings and
Princes conſiſteth not only in their own diſpoſition, but
in theirs alſo who are under their ſubjection; for the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of ſuch as are Rulers is mitigated with humility:
But when mens mindes are void of reverence, and high
and low are confounded all alike, then it is neceſſary
with violence to expel violence. But why do I marvel
that he laid cruelty to my charge, that durſt object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me covetouſneſs? I will not call you to witneſs one
by one, leſt I ſhould upbraid you with my liberalitie, by
making declaration what I have beſtowed upon you. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the whole Army, who a little while ago had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but this bare Armour, do they not lie in ſilver
Beds? are not their Tables charged with Plate? and
poſſeſs they not whole flocks of Slaves? They are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſuſtain the ſpoils of their Enemies.</p>
            <p>But it is ſaid the <hi>Perſians</hi> are honoured of me, whom
we have conquered. Truly they are ſo, and yet what
greater proof can there be of my moderation, than that I
do not reign proudly over ſuch whom I have ſubdued? I
came into <hi>Aſia,</hi> not utterly to ſubvert the Nations, nor
make the one half of the world deſart, but to give the
conquered cauſe not to repine at my Victorie. This is
the occaſion they gladly fight for you and for your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
ſpend their bloud; who, if they were proudly uſed,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:46658:192"/>
would ſtraight rebel againſt you. That poſſeſſion is du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
which is kept by violence, but the thanks of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
received endureth everlaſtingly. If we purpoſe to
enjoy <hi>Aſia,</hi> and not to make a progreſs only through it,
we muſt make them partakers of our clemencie, and then
their fidelitie ſhall make our Empire ſtable and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual;
and truly we have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow more then we can
well wiſh or deſire. Covetouſneſs is an unſatiable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
eſpecially when men deſire to fill the veſſel that
runneth over.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay that I mingle their cuſtomes with
ours. It is ſo; And why? Becauſe I ſee in many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
many things which we need not be aſhamed to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
and ſo great an Empire as we have got cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
be aptly governed, except we deliver ſome
things to them, and receive likewiſe ſome things back
from them again. One thing is to be laughed at, that I
ſhould refuſe <hi>Jupiter</hi> for my Father, being ſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by his Oracle, as who ſaith, the anſwer of the
gods were in my power. He proffered the name of his
ſon unto me, which was not a thing unſeaſonable for
the Atchievements I intended. I would wiſh that the
<hi>Indians</hi> could believe me to be a god; for the ſucceſs in
War ſtandeth much by Fame; and that which is falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believed, ſometime worketh the effect of things that
are true. Do you note me given to exceſs and prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
becauſe I garniſhed your Armor with Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver?
My purpoſe was to ſhew to men accuſtomed to ſuch
things, nothing to be more vile then ſuch kinde of metal,
and to declare that the <hi>Macedons</hi> (invincible in other
things) could not be overcome with Gold it ſelf. After
this manner I ſhall blinde the eyes of the barbarous, who
are always wont at the firſt ſight to wonder at things, be
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:46658:193"/>
they never ſo baſe and vile. And in that we ſhew to
make no eſtimation of it, we ſhall declare to all men that
we are not come for deſire of Gold nor Silver, but to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
the whole world; from which glory thou Traytor
wouldeſt have bereaved me, and betrayed the <hi>Macedons</hi>
(I being ſlain) to the barbarous Nations. I am exhorted
to ſpare their Parents; Although it was not expedient
that they ſhould know what I have determined of them,
and to the intent they might die with the greater grief,
if they have any care or memory of them; yet long ago I
have forborn the cuſtome of putting the innocent Parents
and kinsfolks of traytors to death with the offenders; and
I now profeſs to pardon them, and have them all in the
ſame eſtimation I had before. I know thou wouldeſt
have thy Maſter <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> brought forth, who only
eſteemed thee, being of his complexion, becauſe thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireſt
to hear pronounced from his mouth thoſe railing
words which even now thou didſt vomit out againſt
me: If he had been a <hi>Macedon</hi> born, I had brought
him into the place with thee, a worthy Maſter of ſuch a
Diſciple; but being born in another Countrey, he is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to another law.</p>
            <p>When he had ſpoken theſe words, he diſmiſſed
the Council, and commanded all ſuch as were
condemned to be delivered to the Souldiers of their
own Regiments; who, becauſe they would declare
by ſome cruelty the love they bare towards their
Prince, ſlew them by all torments. <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> alſo
died upon the Rack, innocent of the conſpiracy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Kings perſon, but a man not pliable to the
cuſtom of the Court, and abhorring from the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Flatterers. There was never any thing that
brought the <hi>Greeks</hi> into a greater indignation againſt
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:46658:193"/>
               <hi>Alexander,</hi> then that he not only killed, but cauſed to
be tormented to death, and that without judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a man indued with godly Manners, and
good Sciences, and one by whom he was perſwaded
to live, when he purpoſed to have died for ſorrow
that he had ſlain <hi>Clitus,</hi> for which his cruelty repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
followed that came too late. But leſt he might
nouriſh idleneſs, apt for the ſowing of ſeditious ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
he advanced towards <hi>India,</hi> always more
glorious in War than after his Victory.</p>
            <p>The whole Country of <hi>India</hi> lieth chiefly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Eaſt, containing more in length than it
doth in bredth. The North parts are full of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and Hills, but all the reſt of the land is plain,
having many fair Rivers, which running out of the
Mount <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> do paſs pleaſantly through the
Countrey. <hi>Indus</hi> is more cold than any other of
the Rivers, whoſe water is not unlike the colour of
the Sea. But of all the Rivers in the Orient, <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
is moſt excellent, which running from the South,
paſſeth directly through many great Mountains, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
that by the encountring with Rocks, his courſe is
turn'd towards the Eaſt, where it is received into
the red Sea: The violence of the ſtream breaketh
down his banks, ſwallowing trees, and much of the
ground. In many places the ſtream is kept in with
the rocks on which it beateth; but where the ground
is more ſoft, there the River becometh more
large, and maketh many Iſlands. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of <hi>Ganges</hi> is much increaſed by the River of
<hi>Ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſines,</hi> which both meet before they enter into the
Sea: at their meeting the water is violently trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and whiles the one reſiſteth the others entry,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:46658:194"/>
neither of them ſeem to give place to other. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardnes</hi>
is a River of the leſs Fame, becauſe is runneth
in the uttermoſt bounds of <hi>India:</hi> but yet it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth Crocodiles as the <hi>Nile</hi> doth; and alſo Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins,
with Monſters unknown to other Nations.
Crooked <hi>Erimanthus,</hi> with his many turnings and
reflexions, is conſumed by the Inhabitants with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
their ground; which is the cauſe that when
it draweth near the Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it becometh very little,
and beareth no name. There are many other Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
that divide the Countrey; but none of them
are ſo famous as theſe, becauſe they do not run ſo
far. The North-winde doth blaſt and annoy thoſe
parts moſt that are next unto the Sea: but thoſe
Windes are ſo broken with the tops of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
that they cannot endamage the inward parts
of the Countrey; wherefore Fruits are very plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
there, and perfect. But that Region doth ſo
much differ from the ordinary courſe of time in
other parts of the world, that, when other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
are burned moſt with the Sun, <hi>India</hi> is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
over with Snow: And when other places
are Frozen, the Heat is there moſt intolerable; and
yet there appeareth not any natural cauſe why it
ſhould be ſo.</p>
            <p>The colour of the <hi>Indian</hi> Sea not differing much
from the water of other Seas, did take his name of
King <hi>Erithrus,</hi> by reaſon whereof the ignorant
<hi>Greeks</hi> took opinion that the water of thoſe Seas
was red. The Land is very aboundant of Flax;
whereof the greater part of their Garments are
made. The twigs of the Trees are ſo tender, that
they receive the Prints of Letters like wax. The
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:46658:194"/>
Birds by teaching, counterfeit the voices of men.
There are many Beaſts which are not bred among
other Nations. <hi>Rhinocerots</hi> are there bred, but not
brought forth. The Elephants of that Countrey
are ſtronger than thoſe that are made tame in <hi>Africk,</hi>
and their highneſs doth anſwer to their ſtrength.
The water of the Rivers doth carry down Gold,
and run mildely without any great fall. The Sea
doth caſt upon the Shore both Pearls and precious
Stones, whereof proceeded the cauſe of their great
Riches; for after their Merchandize was once known
to other Nations, the purgings of the Seas were
highly eſteemed, as the fanſie of man would make
the price.</p>
            <p>The diſpoſitions of the men (as in all other places)
are according to the ſcituation of the Countries
they dwell in. They make their Garments of
Linnen Cloth, which cover their bodies down to
their feet. They binde Sandals under their feet,
and wear Rolls of Linnen about their Heads. Such
as are in any Degree, either of Nobility or Riches,
have precious Stones hanging at their Ears, and
they cover all their Arms with Bracelets and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Gold. They uſe great curioſity in Comb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their Heads, which they cut very ſeldome.
They ſhave without any form of gravity all parts
of their Face, ſaving their Chin. But the exceſs of
voluptuoaſneſs (which they call magnificence)
uſed by them, doth exceed the vices of all Nations.
When their will is to be ſeen abroad, their ſervants
carry about them Perfuming Pans of Silver, and fill
all the ways where they go with ſweet Savors: they
themſelves are born in Litters of Gold hanging
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:46658:195"/>
with pearls, and the Garments they wear are of
gold and purple empaled together. The armed men
follow their Litter, and ſuch as are of their Guard;
among whom are Birds born upon boughs, which
they teach always to ſing, when they are converſant
in earneſt matters.</p>
            <p>In the Kings Palace are pillars of gold carved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with vines of gold, wherein the Images of
thoſe Birds they delight in moſt are artificially
wrought. The Court is open to all comers. When
the Kings do comb and dreſs their heads, they uſe to
give anſwer to the Embaſſadors, and execute juſtice
upon their people. When their Sandals are taken off,
their feet are anointed with ſweet odours. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
travel they take, is when they hunt wilde Beaſts
incloſed in Parks, which they ſtrike whiles their
Concubines are ſinging and dallying with them: the
Arrows they ſhoot are of two cubits long, which do
not the effect of the force they are ſhot withal, by
reaſon of their weight, which is an impediment to
their ſwiftneſs, wherein the property of the Arrow
chiefly conſiſteth. In ſmall journeys they uſe to ride
on horſeback: but when they are to travel further,
they are carried upon Elephants, whoſe huge bodies
are covered all over with gold. And becauſe no vice
ſhould be wanting in their corrupt manners, great
numbers of Concubines do follow them in golden
Litters. The Queens have their companies ſeparate
by themſelves, who in all exceſs of voluptuouſneſs
are nothing inferiour to the Kings. It belongeth to
the women there to dreſs meat, and they alſo ſerve
men with wine, whereof there is great plenty among
the <hi>Indians.</hi> When the King hath largely drunk,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:46658:195"/>
and is fallen into a ſleep, his Concubines uſe to carry
him into his Chamber, calling upon their gods in
a Hyn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> after their Countrey manner.</p>
            <p>Who would think that amongſt all theſe vices
there were any regard of vertue? there are amongſt
them a rough kinde of people, whom they call wiſe
men, who count it the moſt glorious thing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
their own death: and they uſe to burn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
while they are alive. It is imputed for a
great ſhame to ſuch as either cannot well ſtir for
age, or have not their perfect health, if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
their life till their natural death approach: nor
is there any honour given to thoſe bodies that die for
age. They think the Fires to be defiled, if the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
be not alive that are burned in them. Such as
live in Cities after a civil manner, attain to the moſt
knowledge of the motion of the Stars, and of the
prophecy of things to come; nor can they think that
any man doth ſhorten his life, that looketh for
death without fear. They eſteem thoſe for gods
whom they begin once to worſhip, and eſpecially
trees; the violating of which, they forbid upon pain
of death. They number fifty days to the month,
and notwithſtanding limit their years as they do
in other places. They note not their times by
ſuch courſe of the Moon, as is commonly uſed,
that is, from the full Moon, but from the firſt quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
when ſhe beginneth to be horned; and by count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after the ſame manner, they make their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
more uncertain. There are many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things reported of them, with which I
thought not neceſſary to interrupt the order of this
Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="366" facs="tcp:46658:196"/>
As <hi>Alexander</hi> entred into <hi>India,</hi> the Princes of the
Countrey addreſſed themſelves unto him, ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves, and declaring that he was the
third man being begotten of <hi>Jupiter</hi> that came into
their Countrey. They ſaid that <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
were not known to them, but only by fame;
but they rejoyced that they might behold him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
with their eyes. <hi>Alexander</hi> received them
with all the gentleneſs he could deviſe, and willed
them to accompany him, becauſe he would uſe
them as Guides in his Journey. But when he ſaw
that the whole Nation came not, he ſent <hi>Perdicas</hi>
and <hi>Epheſtion</hi> with part of his Army before, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
ſuch as would not ſubmit themſelves; and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them to go forwards till they came to the River
of <hi>Indus,</hi> and there to make Boats, in which he
might tranſport his Army: and becauſe they had
to paſs many Rivers, the Boats were ſo deviſed,
that they might be taken aſunder and carried in
Carts, and afterwards joyned together again. He
appointed <hi>Craterus</hi> to follow him with the <hi>Phalanx,</hi>
and he with ſuch Horſemen and Footmen as were
light armed marched before; and being Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
on his way, he Fought a ſmall Battel, and
drove his Enemies into the next City. When <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus</hi>
was come (to the intent he might ſtrike ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
amongſt thoſe people that had not yet proved
the <hi>Macedons</hi> Force) he commanded that when
they won the City, they ſhould kill both man, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and childe, and burn the ſame to the ground;
but as he was riding about the Walls, he was hurt
with an Arrow. Notwithſtanding the City was
won, and all put to the Sword, the very houſes
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:46658:196"/>
not eſcaping the cruelty of the Conquerours.</p>
            <p>After this, he ſubdued an obſcure Nation, and
came to a City called <hi>Niſa.</hi> It chanced that whiles
they incamped in a Wood before the City, there
fell a cold in the night which more afflicted the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedons</hi>
than ever it had done before in any other
place; againſt the which they prepared the remedy
that was next at hand, and cut down the Wood to
make them great fires: the flame whereof took
hold of the Sepulchres belonging to the City, which
by reaſon they were made of Cedar, they were ſoon
ſet on fire, and never left burning till they were all
conſumed. The fire made both an Alarm in the
City, and in the Camp; for the Citizens thereby
judged that their Enemies would make ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
againſt them; and the <hi>Macedons</hi> perceived
by the barking of the Dogs, and the noiſe of
the men, that the <hi>Indians</hi> would ſalley out upon
them.</p>
            <p>Wherefore <hi>Alexander</hi> iſſuing out of his Camp in
order to Battel, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lew ſuch as attempted the Fight.
Thereupon, they within the City became of divers
opinions; ſome were minded to yield, and others
thought good to adventure the extremity. When
<hi>Alexander</hi> underſtood of their diviſion, he cauſed
his men to abſtain from ſlaughter, and only to
maintain the Siege. At length, they were ſo wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with the diſcommodities of the War, that they
yielded themſelves. They affirmed their original
to be from <hi>Bacchus,</hi> who indeed builded their City
at the foot of a Mountain called <hi>Meroe:</hi> the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of which Mountain being reported to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
by the Inhabitants, he ſent Victuals before, and
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:46658:197"/>
paſſed thither with his whole Army, incamping
upon the top thereof.</p>
            <p>The Mountain grew full of Vines and Ivy, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
with Springs that flowed out in every
place. The ſame was alſo plentiful of many kinds
of Apples of moſt pleaſant taſte: the ground alſo
brought forth Corn without cultivation. There
grew plenty of Lawrel-trees, with many kindes of
wilde fruit. I cannot impute it unto any motion
of religion, but rather to plenty and wantonneſs,
that cauſed <hi>Alexander</hi> to repair thither: where, of
the Ivy and the Vine-leaves were made Garlands by
the Souldiers, who ran up and down the Hills (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a diſſolute manner) all the hollows and valleys
thereabout rebounding with the voice of ſo many
thouſands of men, calling upon <hi>Bacchus,</hi> to whom
that place was dedicate: which licenſe and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
being begun of a few, was ſpread ſo ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
through the whole Army, that the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
ſcattered abroad without order, lay here and
there repoſing themſelves upon the graſs and
leaves that they had gathered together, as it
had been a time of quiet and moſt aſſured
peace: which licentiouſneſs of the Souldiers, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
by chance, <hi>Alexander</hi> did not withſtand, but
ten days together made Feaſts to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> during
which time he plentifully banqueted his whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
Who can therefore deny, but that greatneſs
of fame and glory, is oftentimes a benefit rather of
fortune than of vertue? for their Enemies had no
heart to ſet upon them, whiles they were drowned
in this exceſs of banqueting, drunkenneſs, and ſloth,
but were as much afraid of their drunkenneſs, as if
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:46658:197"/>
they had heard their cry encounting with them in
Battel: which felicity preſerving them here, did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
defend them after the ſame manner in the
middeſt of their Enemies, returning as it were in
triumph from the Ocean Sea, when they were given
all to feaſting and to drunkenneſs.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> deſcended from the Mountain,
he went to a Countrey called <hi>Dedala,</hi> which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
forſook, and fled to the Woods and wilde
Mountains; and therefore he paſſed from thence
into <hi>Acadera,</hi> which he found both burned and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned
likewiſe of the inhabitants, whereby of
neceſſity he was compelled to uſe the War after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manner. For he divided his Army into divers
parts, and ſhewed his power in many places at
once. By which means he oppreſſed them before
they could provide for themſelves, and ſubdued
them to their utter ruine. <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> took moſt Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
but <hi>Alexander</hi> won the greateſt, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
joyned again his Army together, which he
had thus divided. That done, he went forwards
and paſſed a River called <hi>Choaſpe,</hi> where he left
<hi>Cenon</hi> to beſiege a rich City called <hi>Bezira,</hi> and he
himſelf went to <hi>Mazage,</hi> where <hi>Aaſſacanus</hi> being
dead, had left the Dominion both of the Countrey
and the City to his Mother <hi>Cleophes.</hi> There were
three hundred thouſand Footmen to defend that
City, which was both well fortified and ſtrong of
ſcituation, being incloſed upon the Eaſt with a
ſwift River, having ſteep Banks defending the
City, that it could not be approached on that
ſide. Upon the South and the Weſt parts, nature (as
it were for the once) had planted high Rocks lying
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:46658:198"/>
betwixt them, and deep hollows and pits made
many hundred years before; where the Rocks ceaſed,
there began a Ditch of Wonderful depth and wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
The Wall wherewith the City was incloſed,
was 35 Furlongs in compaſs; whereof the nether
parts were builded of ſtone, and the upper parts of
clay; yet the ſtones were mixed with the clay, to
the intent that the frail ſubſtance clinging to the
harder, the one ſhould binde the other: and leſt the
Earth waſhed upon with the rain might fall all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
there were ſtanchings of Timber put betwixt
to ſtay the whole work, which, covered over with
boards, was a way for men to go upon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> beholding this kinde of fortification
was uncertain what to do. For he ſaw he could
not approach to the Walls, but by filling of thoſe
Ditches and hollow places; and that he could not
otherwiſe fill them, than by making of a Mount,
which was the only way he had to bring his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
to the Walls; but whiles he was viewing the
Town after that manner, he was ſtruck from the
wall with an Arrow on the thigh, which he pulled
out, and without wrapping of his wound, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for his horſe, and letted not for his hurt to give
order for ſuch things as he thought expedient. But
at length, when by hanging of his leg, the bloud
drew from the wound and waxed cold, whereby
his hurt began to pain him, he then ſaid he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the ſon of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> but yet he felt in himſelf the
infirmities of a diſeaſed body. Notwithſtanding
he would not return into the Camp, before he had
viewed what was neceſſary, and gave order for all
things he would have done. After the Souldiers
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:46658:198"/>
had received their orders, by plucking down of
Houſes without the Town, they got great plenty of
ſtuff to make the Mount withal; and by caſting
ſtocks of trees on heaps into the ditches and hollow
places, the Mount within nine days was raiſed up
to the top of the walls, and the Towers were plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon the ſame; ſuch was the labour and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
that the Souldiers uſed in this buſineſs. The
King before his wound was cloſed up, took the
pains to ſee how the Works went forwards; and
when he perceived them in ſuch height, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
the Souldiers for their diligence, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
things to be brought to the walls; by reaſon of
which, they that defended the walls were ſore affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with ſhot: and by reaſon they had not ſeen any
ſuch kinde of work before, they were wonderfully
amazed, eſpecially when they beheld the towers of
ſuch bigneſs to come forwards, and yet could not
perceive by what means they were moved; they
therefore judged it to be done by the power of the
gods. And beſides, they could not think it a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of mans invention, that ſo great Darts and Spears
as came among them, ſhould be ſhot by Engines.
Deſpairing therefore of the defence of their City,
they retired into the Caſtle; and becauſe they could
not be ſatisfied any manner of way till they had
yielded themſelves, they ſent Embaſſadors to the
King to ask pardon; which being obtained at his
hand, the Queen with a great train of Noble wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
came forth, bearing in their hands cups of gold
full of Wine. The Queen preſenting her little Son
before the Kings feet, not only obtained pardon,
but alſo a reſtorement to her former dignity. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:46658:199"/>
ſome thought that her beauty procured her
more favour than his mercy: but this is certain,
that the Childe which afterwards ſhe brought forth
(whoſoever did beget it) was called <hi>Alexander.</hi>
From this place <hi>Polipercon</hi> was ſent with a power to
a City called <hi>Nora,</hi> where he overthrew in Battel the
inhabitants that encountred with him, whereby he
got the City to his poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>There were many other Cities obſcure of fame
which came into <hi>Alexanders</hi> hands, by the aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
of the inhabitants, who aſſembled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
together in arms, and kept a Rock called <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is.</hi>
The ſame was, that <hi>Hercules</hi> had beſieged
this Rock beforetime in vain, and by reaſon of an
Earth-quake was enforced to depart. When <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
viewed this Rock, and ſaw how ſteep it was
and unpaſſable, he became void of counſel, till ſuch
time as an old man that knew well the place, came
to him with his two ſons, offering for a reward to
guide his men by a way to the top of the Rock. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
promiſed them fourſcore Talents; and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one of his ſons as a pledge, he ſent him to
perform what he had promiſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mullinus</hi> the Kings Secretary was appointed with
certain Souldiers light armed, to follow the Guide,
whoſe purpoſe was to deceive the <hi>Indians,</hi> by fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a compaſs about the Rock; but this ſame Rock
was not as the moſt part of Rocks are, which lying
aſloap, have ways up unto the top by degrees; for
it ſtood upright after the faſhion of a Butt, being
broad beneath, and ever as it grew upward, it grew
leſs and leſs, till it became ſharp in the top; and it
was incloſed on the one ſide with the River of <hi>Indus,</hi>
               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:46658:199"/>
having high and ſteep banks, and upon the other
ſide with deep ditches and hollow places, full of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and mud. Wherefore there could be deviſed
no way to win it, except thoſe ditches were firſt
filled. There was a Wood at hand, which the King
commanded to be cut down; and cauſing the
boughs to be ſhred off for the carriage, they filled
the hollows with the bare ſtocks. <hi>Alexander</hi> bare
the firſt tree, and all the Souldiers followed with
a couragious ſhout: for there was no man that
would refuſe to do that which they ſaw the King
begin, ſo that within ſeven days the ditches and
hollow places were filled up. Then the King
appointed the Agrians and the Archers to go to
the Aſſault, and did chuſe thirty young men of
ſuch as he judged moſt apt for the purpoſe, out
of his own Band, appointing <hi>Charus</hi> and one <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
to be their Conductors, and exhorted <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
that the remembrance of his Name might
make him hardy.</p>
            <p>At the firſt, becauſe the hazard was ſo manifeſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
the King was not determined to adventure his own
perſon; but when the Trumpet blew to the Aſſault,
he was of ſuch a ready courage, that he could not
abſtain, but making a ſigne to his Guard that they
ſhould follow him, he was the firſt that ſet foot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Rock. There were few contented to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arry
behinde, but many left their array where they ſtood
in order of Battel, and followed the King. The
chance of thoſe was miſerable whom the running
River ſwallowed in, when they fell down from the
Rock: which ſight was ſorrowful to ſuch as were
out of danger, being admoniſhed by the peril of
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:46658:200"/>
others, what they ought to fear themſelves; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
their compaſſion being turned into fear, they
lamented as well themſelves, as thoſe whom they
ſaw die before their faces. At length, they advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
ſo far, that without getting of the Rock they
could not retire back again without apparent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
For their Enemies rowled down great
ſtones upon them, wherewith they were eaſily bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
down, by reaſon the Rock had ſo ſlippery and
unſtable ſtanding. Yet for all that, <hi>Charus</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi>
who were appointed to the leading of the
thirty choſen Souldiers, had gotten to the top of
the Rock, and began to fight hand to hand. But
there was ſo many Darts caſt at them from afar, that
they received more wounds than they could give:
wherefore <hi>Alexander</hi> both mindful of his name and
of his promiſe, whiles he fought more eagerly than
warily, was incloſed about and ſlain. Whom when
<hi>Charus</hi> ſaw dead, he ran upon his Enemies; and
unmindful of all things, ſaving of revenge, he ſlew
many with his Pike, and divers with his Sword.
But being laid at by ſo many at once, he fell down
dead upon the body of his Friend. The death of
theſe two ſo hardy young men, and of the reſt, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>Alexander</hi> greatly; yet perceiving no remedy,
he cauſed the Retreat to be ſounded. It was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for their ſafeguard, that they ret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed by little and
little without appearance of any fear. And the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
contented to have repulſed their Enemies,
purſued not after them. <hi>Alexander</hi> hereupon was
determined to leave off his purpoſe, ſeeing he ſaw
no hope how to win the rock: yet he made a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
as though he meant to continue the Siege
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:46658:200"/>
ſtill. For he both cauſed the wayes to be cloſed
up, and made an approach with towers of wood,
always putting freſh men in the place of them that
were wearied.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Indians</hi> perceived <hi>Alexanders</hi> obſtinacy,
two days and two nights they banqueted continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
and played upon timbrels, after this manner to
cauſe their Enemies to think they had no doubt in
the Siege, but truſted certainly to prevail. The third
night the noiſe of the timbrel ceaſed, and many
torches were ſeen burning, that the <hi>Indians</hi> had
lighted to ſee which way they might eſcape down
the Rock in the dark of the night. <hi>Alexander</hi> ſent
<hi>Balachrus</hi> to diſcover the Event, who found that
the <hi>Indians</hi> were fled, and that the Rock was aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.
Then a ſigne was given that the whole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>my
ſhould give a ſhout together, whereby they did ſtrike
ſuch fear amongſt their Enemies flying without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that many of them thinking the <hi>Macedons</hi> at their
backs, leaped down the Rocks, and ſlew themſelves;
whereof ſome ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>med in their falling, were left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
their fellows that fled away.</p>
            <p>Thus the King being Conquerour of the place
rather than of the men, teſtified notwithſtanding,
with ſolemn ſacrifice to the gods, a greatneſs or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
and ſet up Altars on the rock to <hi>Minerva</hi> and
<hi>Victoria.</hi> And though the Guides that he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his light armed men, performed not ſo much
as they promiſed; yet their reward was truly given
them. And the rule of the Rock, with the Countrey
thereabouts, was committed to <hi>Siſocoſtus,</hi> he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
going forwards with his Army from thence to
<hi>Ech<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="376" facs="tcp:46658:201"/>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> underſtanding that certain ſtraights
through the which he ſhould paſs, were kept by
one <hi>Erix</hi> with twenty thouſand armed men, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
that part of his Army that were heavy laden
to <hi>Cenon,</hi> to be brought on by ſoft journeys; and
going before in perſon with the Slingers and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
he put his Enemies to flight, making the way
clear for his Army to paſs that followed after. The
<hi>Indians,</hi> whether it were for the hatred they did
bear unto their Captain, or elſe to get the favour of
the Conquerour, killed <hi>Erix</hi> as he fled away, and
brought his head and his armour unto <hi>Alexander.</hi>
He conſidering the foulneſs of the act, would not
honour the doers for their example ſake, nor puniſh
them becauſe they ſerved his purpoſe.</p>
            <p>From thence by ſixteen encampings he came to
that part of the River called <hi>Indus,</hi> where <hi>Epheſtion</hi>
had prepared all things in ſuch ſort as he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.
One <hi>Omphis</hi> was King of that Countrey,
who before had perſwaded his Father to ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
unto <hi>Alexander,</hi> and immediately upon his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
death ſent Embaſſadors unto him to know
his pleaſure, whether he ſhould take upon him as
a King before his coming, or elſe live privately in
the mean ſeaſon: And although he was permitted
to govern as a King, yet he would not uſe the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
granted him until the King came. He had
cauſed <hi>Epheſtion</hi> to be received in the beſt ſort he
could deviſe, but notwithſtanding he had not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited
him, becauſe he would not commit his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to any mans fidelity, but to the Kings.</p>
            <p>When he underſtood of <hi>Alexanders</hi> coming, he
went towards him with his whole Power, whoſe
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:46658:201"/>
Elephants by ſmall diſtances mixed in Battel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
his Footmen, ſhewed afar off like Caſtles.
At the firſt <hi>Alexander</hi> did not take him a Friend, but
as an Enemy; and therefore ſet his Men in order of
Battel, and his Horſemen in wings in readineſs to
Fight. When <hi>Omphis</hi> underſtood the errour of the
<hi>Macedons,</hi> he commanded his men to ſtay, and
putting his ſpurs to his Horſe, he rode forwards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone:
<hi>Alexander</hi> did the like, not queſtioning whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he were a Friend or an Enemy, but thought
himſelf ſecure, either through his own manhood,
or the others fidelity. Their meeting, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
by their countenances, was very friendly;
but for want of an Interpreter they could not
ſpeak together: therefore after they had called
one unto them, the <hi>Indian</hi> King declared unto
<hi>Alexander,</hi> that the cauſe he met him with an
Army, was to put immediately his whole power
into his hands; and tarried not to intreat for any
aſſurance by Meſſengers, but upon truſt only had
committed both his Perſon and his Kingdom to him,
whom he knew to make War for the winning of
Glory and Fame; and therefore could not fear in
him any perfidiouſneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> rejoyced to ſee his ſimplicity, and prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
him his right hand as a pledge of his promiſe,
and reſtored unto him again his Kingdom. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
unto <hi>Alexander</hi> fifty and ſix Elephants, with
many other Beaſts of exceeding greatneſs, and three
thouſand Bulls, which is a Cattel of great value in
thoſe Countries, and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>

               <pb n="378" facs="tcp:46658:202"/>
He anſwered, <hi>that he was driven of neceſſity to have
more Souldiers, becauſe he was at War with two Kings,
whoſe Kingdoms lay beyond the River of</hi> Hydaſpis;
<hi>their names were</hi> Abiaſares, <hi>and</hi> Porus, <hi>but the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
remained in</hi> Porus. He ſaid, <hi>that he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
and reſolved to adventure the hazard of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
with ſuch of them as ſhould invade him firſt.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Alexander</hi> granted unto <hi>Omphis</hi> both to take
upon him the Diadem, and the name of his Father,
that was called <hi>Taxiles;</hi> the cuſtom of the Countrey
being ſuch, that the Name ever followed the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
whoſoever enjoyed it.</p>
            <p>When he had received <hi>Alexander</hi> honourably in
hoſpitality three days, the fourth day he declared
how much Corn he had delivered to <hi>Epheſtion,</hi> and
to his Army; preſenting to the King, and to all his
Friends, Crowns of Gold, and beſides of Coined
Silver fourſcore talents. <hi>Alexander</hi> rejoyced ſo much
in his good will, that he both returned again to him
his Gifts, and gave him beſides a thouſand Talents of
the ſpoil he brought with him, with much Plate of
gold and ſilver, many garments after the <hi>Perſian</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and thirty of his own Horſes, with the ſame fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
they did wear when he did ride upon them;
which liberality, as it obliged <hi>Omphis,</hi> ſo it greatly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
the minde of the <hi>Macedons.</hi> For <hi>Meleager</hi>
at Supper when he had well drunk, ſaid, <hi>He was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
glad that</hi> Alexander <hi>had yet found one in</hi> India,
<hi>whom he judged worthy to receive the Gift of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Talents.</hi> The King bearing in minde how
much he had repented the ſlaying of <hi>Clitus</hi> for the
raſhneſs of his tongue, refrained his anger; but yet
told him, <hi>That envious men were ever Tormentors to
themſelves.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="379" facs="tcp:46658:202"/>
The next day the Embaſſadors of King <hi>Abiaſares</hi>
came unto <hi>Alexander,</hi> who according to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
offered all things unto his will: whereupon
aſſurance being confirmed, they returned again to
their Maſter. <hi>Alexander</hi> therefore thinking that
through the greatneſs of his name, <hi>Porus</hi> might be
brought to do the like, ſent <hi>Cleochares</hi> to him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
tribute, and to ſummon him to come and do
homage, when he ſhould enter the bounds of his
Kingdom. <hi>Porus</hi> made anſwer, <hi>That of thoſe two
requeſts he would perform one, which was, to meet
him at the entry of his Kingdom, but that ſhould be
in Arms, and with a Power. Alexander</hi> therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
determined to paſs the River of <hi>Hydaſpis, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zantes</hi>
that had been Author of the Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

committing them both to priſon, and the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants

But <hi>Porus</hi> lay encamped on the further ſide

hath been ſaid before) were more heavy than they
could wield. <hi>Porus</hi> himſelf did ride upon an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
greater than all the reſt; who alſo being of a
big ſtature, appeared notable in his Armour that
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:46658:203"/>
was garniſhed with gold and ſilver, having alſo a
courage equal to the ſtrength of his body, and ſo
great a wiſdom as was poſſible to be found amongſt
ſo rude a Nation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Macedons</hi> were not ſo much afraid with the
ſight of their Enemies, as they were with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the River they had to paſs, which being four
Furlongs in bredth, and ſo deep that no footing
could be found, appeared to them like a great Sea;
and yet the largeneſs thereof nothing mitigated
the violence of the ſtream, but it ran with no leſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
than if it had been narrow, appearing by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percuſſion
of the water in many places, to be full of
great ſtones in the bottom.</p>
            <p>This River being ſufficient to affright them of it
ſelf, the ſight of the further bank, full of Horſe and
Men; was an increaſe to their terrour; where the
Elephants that had bodies of an unreaſonable great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſtood in their ſight, being provoked to bray of
purpoſe, to the intent that with their terrible noiſe
they ſhould fill their Enemies ears with fear. Though
the <hi>Macedons</hi> were couragious, and their hearts full
of good hope, as they who oftentim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s had experience
of their own acts, yet their Enemies and the River
both together, made them wonderfully amazed;
for they could not think how to keep a ſtedfaſt courſe
to the further ſhore in ſo weak and uncertain Boats;
nor when they were there, could they ſee how to
arrive with ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>There were many Iſlands in the middeſt of the
River, into the which both the <hi>Indians</hi> and the
<hi>Macedons</hi> did ſwim, holding their weapons above
their heads: Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſight of both Kings, who by experience of this
ſmall bickering, made trial of the ſucceſs of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
to come.</p>
            <p>But amongſt the <hi>Macedons</hi> there were two noble
young men, called <hi>Siſimachus</hi> and <hi>Nicanor,</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in courage, and in hardy attempts; and through
their continual good fortune, had got a reſolution to
deſpiſe all peril. Other young men took them for
their Captains, and without any other armour
ſaving their Pikes, ſwom over into an Iſland which
was full of their Enemies, where through their
boldneſs only, they ſlew many of them, and ſo
might have returned with glory, if raſhneſs (where
it findeth proſperous ſucceſs) could ever be content
with meaſure: But while with ſcorn and pride
they tarried for their Enemies, they were ſuddenly
incloſed by ſuch as did ſwim over the River, and
were killed with Darts, which they caſt at them
from afar. Such as eſcaped their Enemies, were
drowned in depth of water, or eddies of the ſtream.</p>
            <p>This fight put <hi>Porus</hi> in great courage, who ſaw all
their doings from the further ſhore: And though <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
was long uncertain what way to take, yet
at length he deceived his Enemies by this policy.
There was an Iſland in the River greater than the

Horſemen to ſhew themſelves againſt their Enemies
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:46658:204"/>
far off from the Iſland, and to put the <hi>Indians</hi> in
fear of them, making ever a ſhew as though they
would ſwim over the River; which thing <hi>Ptolomy</hi>
did many days together, to the intent that <hi>Porus</hi>
ſhould be inforced to remove his Army to that part
to withſtand him, and thereby brought them out of
ſight of the Iſland. <hi>Alexander</hi> alſo cauſed his own
Pavilion to be ſet upon the Rivers ſide over againſt
his Enemies, and all the pomp that pertained to the
ſtate of a King to be ſet forth within their view,
with his Lifeguard ſtanding in ſight, the ſame
which was wont to attend his perſon: Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
<hi>Attalus,</hi> who was equal with <hi>Alexander</hi> in
years, and like unto him both in face and perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
ſtood there openly apparelled like the King,
that it might appear to <hi>Porus,</hi> that <hi>Alexander</hi> was
ſtill remaining there, and went not about to paſs
the River.</p>
            <p>The execution of this deſigne was firſt letted by a
tempeſt, whereby afterwards it was furthered, and
brought to good effect; fortune ever uſing to turn
her diſcommodities into good ſucceſs towards
him. For when the Enemies were thus attent to
obſerve <hi>Ptolomy</hi> who lay upon the river againſt him,
and <hi>Alexander</hi> with the reſt of his Army was buſie
about the paſſing of his men into the Iſland before
mentioned, there fell ſuddenly a great ſtorm, ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tolerable to ſuch as lay within their Cabines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which ſo much afflicted the Souldiers abroad, that
they forſook their Boats, and fled again to land.
And yet for all this, their buſling and noiſe was not
heard of their Enemies, through the vehemency of
the ſhower.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="383" facs="tcp:46658:204"/>
As this Tempeſt began ſuddenly, ſo it ſuddenly
ceaſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the clouds remained ſo dark, that there
appeared not ſo much light as the Souldiers might
know one another by the face, when they ſpake toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
which darkneſs might have feared ſome other
men, conſidering that they had to row in a River
that they knew not, their Enemies (peradventure)
waiting for them at their landing, whither they
went as blinde men that for glory fought in peril.
But <hi>Alexander</hi> uſed that which put other men in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
to ſerve for his deſire, and willed that every
man (upon a ſigne given) ſhould enter into their
Boats with ſilence: his Boat was the firſt that lanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the ſhore, towards the further ſide of his
Enemies, <hi>Porus</hi> only keeping his Watch againſt
<hi>Ptolomy.</hi> There was but one Boat that ſtuck faſt
by the way upon a Rock, and all the other recovered
the land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> then commanded the Souldiers to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
their armour and fall into array; and whileſt he
was dividing his men, to put them in order of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
and to march towards his Enemies, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to <hi>Porus,</hi> that a great number of men of War
were come over the River, and landed, which
would ſtraightway give him Battel. But he, at the
firſt (according to the fault that is in mans nature
through overmuch confidence in himſelf) believed
it not, but thought that <hi>Abiaſares,</hi> who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
with him, had come to his aſſiſtance. Yet
when the day appeared, and the truth was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
<hi>Porus</hi> put forth a hundred armed Waggons, and
four thouſand Horſemen, under the leading of <hi>Hagis</hi>
his brother, to keep <hi>Alexander</hi> in action.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="384" facs="tcp:46658:205"/>
They counted thoſe Waggons their principal
Force; for every one of them carried ſix men, two
Archers, two with Targets, and two that ruled the
Horſes, which were not unarmed; but when it came
to the Fight, they let their reins looſe, and beſtowed
their Darts among their Enemies. But the uſe of thoſe
Waggons ſerved to ſmall purpoſe; for the ſhower
that had fallen more violently than was accuſtomed,
had made the fields wet and ſlabby, that the Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
could not ſtir, but ſtuck in the mire, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
immoveable; whereas <hi>Alexander</hi> being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
baggage, or any thing that might be an impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unto him, fiercely invaded his Enemies.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scythians</hi> and the <hi>Dahans</hi> were the firſt that
gave the onſet, and <hi>Perdicas</hi> was appointed with the
Horſemen to charge upon the right-hand-Battel of
the <hi>Indians.</hi> Then the Battels beginning to joyn on
all parts, they that had the charge of the Waggons,
counting them their laſt refuge, let looſe the reins,
and ruſhed forward into the midſt of the Fight.</p>
            <p>The coming of theſe Waggons appeared to be a
matter doubtful and dangerous to both Parties; for
at the firſt brunt the <hi>Macedons</hi> were born over and
overthrown by them; and when the Waggons came
in any rough or miry place, the <hi>Indians</hi> were thrown
out of them. For when the Horſes that drew them
were once galled, and put in fear, they carried the
Waggons without government, and tumbled part of
them in the mire, and part into the River: a few tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed
the fields, and fled for ſuccour unto <hi>Porus,</hi> who
ſeeing his Waggons ſcattered all over the Fields, and
to wander about with their Rulers, he diſtributed
the charge of his Elephants amongſt his Friends, and
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:46658:205"/>
placed his Footmen and Archers behinde them.</p>
            <p>He had many that ſounded upon Timbrels (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Inſtruments that the <hi>Indians</hi> uſed in the ſtead
of Trumpets) wherewith their Ears were ſo filled,
that the noiſe of their Enemies little moved them.
They did bear alſo the Image of <hi>Hercules</hi> in the front
of their Foot-battel; which was done for an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
for them to fight well, and for a note of
reproof and ſcandal to them that ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly from
their Standard; for it was loſs of life to leave it in
the Field: So that the fear they conceived of <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
who ſometimes had been their Enemy, was
then turned into a Veneration and Religion.</p>
            <p>The ſight, both of the Elephants, and <hi>Porus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
aſtonied the <hi>Macedons,</hi> and cauſed them a
while to make a ſtand; for the beaſts being ſet in
order amongſt the armed men, ſhewed afar off
like high Towers; and <hi>Porus</hi> himſelf exceeding the
ſtature of moſt men, the Elephant whereupon he
did ride was an addition unto his height, which
excelled ſo much all the other Elephants, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
excelled the reſt of men: So that <hi>Alexander</hi>
beholding both <hi>Porus</hi> and his power, ſaid, <hi>That at
length he had found a Jewel equal unto his heart;
for we have to do</hi> (quoth he) <hi>both with terrible
Beaſts, and with notable Men of War:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he looked towards <hi>Cenon,</hi> and ſaid unto
him:</p>
            <p>When I with <hi>Ptolomy, Perdicas,</hi> and <hi>Epheſtion,</hi>
ſhall ſet upon the left Battel of our Enemies, and you ſhall
ſee us in the heat of fight, do you then ſet forwards my
right Battel, and freſhly aſſail them when you ſee them
begin to fall out of order. <hi>Antigonus, Leonatus,</hi> and
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:46658:206"/>
               <hi>Tauron,</hi> do you bend againſt their Main Battel, and
ſet upon the Front: Our Pikes are long and ſtrong, and
cannot ſerve to any better uſe, then againſt the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants,
wherewith they may be thruſt through, and
ſuch overthrown as are carried upon their backs: The
Elephants are but an uncertain force, which uſe to do
moſt harm unto their own part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for as they uſe to go
againſt their Enemies ſo long as they are at command;
ſo when they are once put in fear, they turn againſt
their own men, and ſhew moſt rage towards them.</p>
            <p>He had not ſo ſoon ſpoken theſe words, but he put
Spurs to his Horſe, advancing againſt his Enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and when, according to his appointment, he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the Charge, <hi>Cenon</hi> with a great Force brake up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the left Battel; and the <hi>Phalanx,</hi> at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
brake in amongſt the midſt of their Enemies.
When <hi>Porus</hi> ſaw the Horſemen give the Charge, he
put forwards his Elephants to encounter them; but
they being ſlow Beaſts, and not apt ſuddenly to
move, were prevented by the ſwiftneſs of the Horſes:
and their Bows ſtood them not in any great ſtead,
for by reaſon their Arrows were ſo long and heavy,
they could not nock them on their Bows, except
they firſt ſtaid their Bows upon the ground; and the
ground was ſo ſlippery, that they could not have
any perfect footing; and while they were preparing
themſelvs to ſhoot, their Enemies were come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them.</p>
            <p>Then every man fled from the order that <hi>Porus</hi>
had given, as it chanceth oftentimes amongſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
minds, where Fear beareth more rule then the
Captains appointment; for in ſo many parts as
their Army was divided, ſo many Generals became
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:46658:206"/>
among them. Some would joyn all their Battels in
one, others would have them divided; ſome willed
to ſtay, and others to go forwards, and incloſe their
Enemies about; there was no general conſultation
amongſt them. <hi>Porus</hi> notwithſtanding, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a few, with whom ſhame prevailed more
then fear, aſſembled ſuch of his Forces together as
were diſperſed abroad, and advanced againſt his
Enemies, ſetting his Elephants in the front of the
Battel. They put the <hi>Macedons</hi> in fear, troubling,
with their unwonted cry, not only the Horſe that
naturally do fear them, but alſo amazed the men,
and diſturbed their order; inſomuch, that they who
a little before thought themſelves Victors, looked
about which way to fly and ſave themſelves: which
when <hi>Alexander</hi> perceived, he ſent againſt the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants
the <hi>Agrians</hi> and <hi>Thracians,</hi> who were men
light armed, and more apt to skirmiſh afar off, then
to fight hand to hand. They bravely aſſaulted the
Elephants and their Governours, and ſore afflicted
them with the multitude of their Darts and Arrows
that they beſtowed amongſt them; and the <hi>Phalanx</hi>
came conſtantly forwards againſt them who were
already in fear; but ſuch as preſſed over-forward in
fighting with the Elephants, procured their manifeſt
deſtruction; and being trampled to death with
their feet, they were an example to others, not to be
over-haſty in adventuring themſelves: The moſt
terrible ſight was, when the Elephants with their
long Trunks, called <hi>Proboſcis,</hi> took the <hi>Macedons</hi> in
their Armour from the ground, and delivered them
up to their Governours.</p>
            <p>The Battel was prolonged doubtfully till the day
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:46658:207"/>
was far ſpent, the Souldiers ſometimes flying from
the Elephants, and ſometimes purſuing after them,
until that with a certain kinde of crooked weapons,
called <hi>Copidae</hi> (prepared for the purpoſe) they cut
the Elephants upon the legs: Theſe the <hi>Macedons</hi>
had right aptly divided; for not only the fear of
death, but alſo the fear of a new kinde of torment
in death, cauſed them to leave nothing unattempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Finally, the Elephants wearied with wounds,
with their violent ſtrugling, did caſt their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
to the earth, and did tear them in pieces;
for they were put in ſuch fear, that they were no
more hurtful to their Enemies, but driven out of
the Battel like ſheep.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Porus</hi> being forſaken of the greater part of his
men, ceaſed not to caſt Darts, whereof he had plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
prepared upon his Elephant, amongſt them that
ſurrounded him, whereby he wounded many; and
by reaſon he lay open to every mans blow, he was
laid at on all parts, till he received nine wounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
and before; through which he bled ſo much,
that he had no power to caſt any more Darts, but for
feebleneſs, they fell out of his hands. The Elephant
alſo which he did ride upon, pricked forwards with
fury, made a great diſturbance amongſt the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,</hi>
until that his Governour ſeeing the King ſo
faint, that he let fall his Darts, and to be almoſt paſt
his remembrance, ſtirred the Beaſt to fly away,
whom <hi>Alexander</hi> followed with all the ſpeed h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
could: But his Horſe being thruſt through with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wounds, fell down dead under him; wherefore
while he was about to change, and take another,
he was caſt far behinde.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="387" facs="tcp:46658:207"/>
In the mean ſeaſon, the Brother of <hi>Taxiles</hi> that
was ſent by <hi>Alexander</hi> unto <hi>Porus,</hi> began to exhort
him that he ſhould not be ſo obſtinate to prove the
extremity, but rather yield himſelf unto the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour:
But he, notwithſtanding that his ſtrength
was almoſt decayed, and his bloud failed; yet ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up at a known voice, he ſaid, <hi>That he knew him
to be the Brother of</hi> Taxiles, <hi>a Traytor to his King
and his Country;</hi> and with that word took a Dart,
which by chance was not fallen from him, and
threw it ſo at <hi>Taxiles</hi> Brother, that it paſſed through
the midſt of his Breaſt into his Back; and having
ſhewed this laſt proof of his Manhood, he fled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
more faſt then before: But when the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,
through many wounds that he had received,
fainted in like ſort, then he ſtayed, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Footmen towards his Enemies that purſued
him.</p>
            <p>By that time <hi>Alexander</hi> was come near unto him;
who underſtanding the obſtinacy of <hi>Porus,</hi> willed
none to be ſpared that made reſiſtance: whereupon
every man threw their Darts againſt <hi>Porus,</hi> and
the Footmen that ſtood in his defence, inſomuch
that at length he was ſo oppreſſed, that he began
to fall from his Elephant. Then the <hi>Indian</hi> who
was his Governour, thinking that <hi>Porus</hi> deſired
to have alighted, cauſed the Beaſt, after his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
manner, to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd towards the earth, who
ſubmitting himſelf, all the reſt, as they were taught,
bowed down their bodies likewiſe; which was
the cauſe of <hi>Porus</hi> taking, and of the reſt. When
<hi>Alexander</hi> ſaw <hi>Porus</hi> on the ground, he cauſed
him to be ſpoiled, thinking he had been dead, and
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:46658:208"/>
divers ran about him to pull off his Armour and his
Veſture; which thing when the Elephant ſaw, he
began to defend his Maſter, running upon the Spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and endeavoured to lift him up again upon his
back: whereupon, they all ſetting upon the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,
ſlew him, and laid <hi>Porus</hi> in a Cart; whom
when <hi>Alexander</hi> did behold to lift up his eyes, he
being moved with no hatred, but with compaſſion,
ſaid unto him:</p>
            <p>What fury poſſeſt thee, hearing the Fame of mine
Acts, to hazard the Battel with me and my Power,
ſeeing <hi>Taxilis</hi> was ſo near an example of the Clemency
that I uſe to ſuch as ſubmit themſelves? <hi>To whom
he made this anſwer:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Foraſmuch as I am demanded a Queſtion, I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
as freely as I am ſpoken unto: Knowing mine own
ſtrength, and not having proved thine, I thought no
man of greater Power then my ſelf; but now the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of this Battel hath declared thee to be the Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier:
and yet therein I do impute to my ſelf no little
felicity, that I have won the ſecond place, and am
next unto thee</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He was asked moreover his Opinion, after what
manner he thought good the Victory ſhould be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed?</hi>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe it <hi>(quoth he)</hi> after ſuch ſort as this days
fortune ſhall ſuggeſt unto thee, wherein there hath
been ſufficient proof ſhewed how tranſitory is the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of man.</p>
            <p>This Admoniſhment availed him more then if he
had ſubmitted himſelf, or made ſuit for his life: For
when <hi>Alexander</hi> ſaw the greatneſs of his courage,
and his heart ſo void of fear that it could not be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with any adverſity, he was moved not only to
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:46658:208"/>
give him his life, but alſo honourably to entertain
him; for as long as he lay diſeaſed of his wounds,
he took no leſs care for the curing of them, then if
he had fought in his quarrel; and when he was once
healed (contrary to that which all men looked for)
he received him amongſt the number of his friends,
and inlarged his Kingdom greater then it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
There was nothing in <hi>Alexanders</hi> nature more
perfect, or more conſtant, then that he would ever
have Vertue in admiration, when it was ſuch that it
deſerved true praiſe and glory, eſpecially when he
ſaw the ſame in his Enemy: But when it was found
in any of his own men, it was ſomewhat croſs unto
him, thinking that their fame might be a deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to his own greatneſs, which he ever thought to
grow greater, as they were of greatneſs whom he
ſubdued.</p>

opened unto him, offered up Sacrifice to the Sun;
and to cauſe his Souldiers to be more willing to go
forwards in finiſhing the reſt of the Wars, he aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
them together, and (after he had commended
their doings) he declared how in the laſt Battel they
had defeated and broken the force of the <hi>Indians</hi>
Power, and ſhould finde from thenceforth nothing
but a plentiful prey: For he ſaid, that in the Country
whereunto he was going, the riches chiefly remained
which were ſo much ſpoken of throughout the world,
in reſpect whereof the ſpoils of the <hi>Perſians</hi> were but
trifles; and that occaſion was now given them, not
only to fill their own houſes, but alſo <hi>Macedonia</hi> and
<hi>Greece</hi> with Pearls, with precious ſtones, with Gold,
and with Ivory. The Souldiers being deſirous both
of Riches and Glory, becauſe they had never found
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:46658:209"/>
his words vain, promiſed him to do whatſoever he
would have them: Whereupon he diſmiſſed them,
full of good hope, and ſet them about the making
of Ships; to the intent, that having overcome all
<hi>Aſia,</hi> he might viſit the Ocean Sea that was in the
end of all the world. The Mountains, next at hand,
were plentiful of Timber to make Ships withal, in
cutting down whereof, the <hi>Macedons</hi> found Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
of ſuch bigneſs, as they had not ſeen before;
and alſo <hi>Rhinocerotes,</hi> Beaſts that be ſeldom found
in any other place; which name was given to them
by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> for in the <hi>Indian</hi> Language they are
otherwiſe called. <hi>Alexander</hi> builded a City upon
either ſide of the River <hi>Hydaſpis;</hi> which once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
he gave to every one of his Captains a
Crown of Gold, and a thouſand pieces of Gold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides;
preferring and rewarding every one accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

before the Battel fought with <hi>Porus,</hi> did ſend
Embaſſadours to him now again, offering to do all
things that he would appoint, ſo that he might
preſerve his body at liberty; for he deſired not to
live, except he might remain a King; and he thought
himſelf unfit to Reign, after he had once been a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
He returned anſwer to <hi>Abiaſares, That if his
coming ſhould be grievous, he would not ſtick to viſit
him in Priſon.</hi> Having thus vanquiſhed <hi>Porus,</hi> and
paſſed the River of <hi>Hydaſpis,</hi> he marched forwards
into the inner-parts of <hi>India,</hi> which was a Country
full of great Woods, and high Trees, the Air
very wholeſome and temperate, the ſhadow of
the Trees mitigating the heat of the Sun, and
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:46658:210"/>
the plenty of Springs keeping the ground moiſt;
there were alſo many Serpents ſeen, whoſe Scales
gliſtered like gold: There was nothing more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
then the poyſon proceeding from them; for
immediately upon the ſtinging, death followed,
until ſuch time as the Inhabitants of the Country
ſhewed a remedy. From thence, through Deſarts,
they came unto the great River <hi>Hidraores,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
there joyned a great Wood, which having ſuch
Trees as are not wont to be ſeen in other places, was
alſo full of wilde Peacocks. <hi>Alexander</hi> removing
his Camp from thence, took a Town by aſſault;
and taking Hoſtages, appointed them to pay Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute.</p>
            <p>After that he came to a great City (builded af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the manner of that Country) which was both
well walled, and alſo invironed about with a deep
Moat: The Inhabitants came forth againſt <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
and joyning their Chariots together in a front
(wherein their Cuſtom was to fight) they proffered
him Battel: Some uſed Darts, ſome Spears, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Pole-axes, and with great agility leaped to
and from their Chariots, when either they found
an advantage to invade their Enemies, or elſe would
reſcue their Fellows that were in diſtreſs. This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted
kinde of fighting put the <hi>Macedons</hi> at the
firſt in a fear, eſpecially being hurt afar off by their
Enemies, and not able to come to fight with them
hand to hand. But after they had conſidered their
diſordered manner, they eſteemed not their force,
but incloſed their Enemies about, and thruſt their
horſes in with pikes; and the ſooner to defeat them,
they cut the Traces wherewith the Chariots were
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:46658:210"/>
tyed, to ſeparate them aſunder. When they had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that manner loſt eight hundred of their men,
they fled again into the City, which the next day
the <hi>Macedons</hi> did win by aſſault: Some there were
that ſaved themſelves by flying, who ſeeing the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
loſt, ſwam over the water, and filled all the
Towns thereabout with fear: They declared of what
invincible force their Enemies were, judging them,
in reſpect of their power, rather to be gods then
mortal men.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> had gotten that City, he ſent
<hi>Perdicas,</hi> with a part of his Army, to deſtroy the
Country, and committing another part to <hi>Eumenes</hi>
for the ſubduing of ſuch as would not ſubmit, he,
with the reſt of his power, came unto a ſtrong City,
to which many of the Inhabitants of the Country
fled: Notwithſtanding that they ſent to <hi>Alexander</hi>
for peace, yet they prepared nevertheleſs for the
war, by reaſon of a Sedition which roſe amongſt
them, which made them to be of divers Opinions;
ſome would rather have indured any extremity then
yield, and others thought they were not able to
make reſiſtance; and whileſt they differed ſo in Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and had no common conſultation amongſt
themſelves, ſuch as held Opinion to yield up the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
opened the Gates, and received in their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
And notwithſtanding that <hi>Alexander</hi> had
juſt cauſe of diſpleaſure againſt the contrary Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet he pardoned them all, and receiving their
Hoſtages, removed towards the next City. When
the <hi>Indians,</hi> that ſtood upon the walls, beheld the
Hoſtages that were brought before the Army, and
perceived them to be of the ſame Nation, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:46658:211"/>
communication with them, who declaring
both the Kings Clemency and his Force, it did move
them to deliver up their City; whoſe example the
reſt of the Cities did follow.</p>
            <p>From thence he came into the Kingdom of the
<hi>Sophites,</hi> who are a Nation as the <hi>Indians</hi> think moſt
excelling in wiſdom, beſt governed, and who have
the moſt civil Converſations amongſt them. The
Children that are there begotten, are not nouriſhed
and brought up according to the will of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
but by the order of ſuch who have the charge
committed unto them to view the ſtate of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants:
If they perceive any not apt to become
active, or elſe wanting any of their limbs, they
cauſe them ſtraightways to be killed. They uſe to
Marry without reſpect of Kindred they come of, or
greatneſs of Parentage, making no choice but in the
ſhape of the body, which is the thing only eſteemed
amongſt them. The King himſelf was in the Chief
City of that Country, againſt which <hi>Alexander</hi>
brought his power: The Gates were ſhut, and no
man appeared in Arms upon the walls to make any
defence; wherefore he ſtood in doubt a great while,
whether the City was abandoned, or whether the
Inhabitants had kept themſelves ſecret for ſome po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy.
While he remained in that expectation, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
the Gate was opened, and the King (who in
goodlineſs of perſon excelled all the reſt) came forth
with his two Sons: He did wear a garment of gold,
and Purple impaled, that covered the Calf of his
leg; the Sandals he did wear on his feet were ſet with
precious ſtones: All his arms were garniſhed with
Pearls, and he had hanging at his ears two precious
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:46658:211"/>
ſtones, which were excellent both for bigneſs and
brightneſs: he had in his hand a Scepter of gold, ſet
with precious ſtones, called <hi>Berilli,</hi> which (after
his ſalutation made) with humble ſubmiſſion he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
unto <hi>Alexander,</hi> yielding both himſelf, his
Children, and his Kingdom into his hands.</p>
            <p>There were in that Country notable Dogs for
the hunting of wilde Beaſts, but above all, moſt eager
on the Lyon; the King therefore, to ſhew their force
and quality unto <hi>Alexander,</hi> put four of them to a
great Lyon, who ſtraightway took hold of him:
Then one who was accuſtomed to that Office, took
one of thoſe Dogs by the Leg to pluck him off from
the Lyon; and becauſe he would not loſe his hold,
he cut off his Leg with a Sword: but when the Dog
hung nevertheleſs upon the Lyon, he was cut in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
by pieces, till ſuch time as he died, having his
teeth ſtill faſtened in the Lyons fleſh; ſuch an eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
had Nature wrought in thoſe Creatures, as it is
committed unto memory. In the compiling of this
Hiſtory, ſometimes I am inforced to write things
that I can ſcarcely believe; for I neither dare affirm
the things whereof I doubt, nor conceal ſuch things
as I have received for truth. <hi>Alexander</hi> leaving this
King within his own Kingdom, came unto the
River of <hi>Hydaſpis,</hi> and there joyned with <hi>Epheſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
who had ſubdued the Country thereabouts.
One <hi>Phegelas</hi> was King of the next Nation, who
commanding his Subjects to continue the tilling of
the ground as they were wont to do, met <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
with rich Preſents, refuſing nothing that was
commanded him.</p>
            <p>When he had tarried with him two days, and was
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:46658:212"/>
determined the third day to have paſſed the River,
he found therein great difficulty, by reaſon that the
ſtream was ſo large, and full of great ſtones: He
ſtayed therefore a while to be more fully advertiſed
of the ſtate of thoſe Countries, and of all ſuch things
as were neceſſary for him to know. He underſtood
by <hi>Phegelas,</hi> how beyond that River there lay a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart
of ten days journey, and next to that Deſart the
River of <hi>Ganges,</hi> which was the greateſt River in
all the Orient: He declared to him, that beyond
<hi>Ganges</hi> there inhabited two Nations, called <hi>Ganga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridans</hi>
and <hi>Pharaſians,</hi> whoſe King was called <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gramenes,</hi>
who uſed to come to the Field with twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thouſand Horſemen, two hundred thouſand Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
two thouſand armed Waggons, and three
thouſand Elephants, which were counted of all to be
the greateſt terrour. Theſe things ſeemed incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
unto <hi>Alexander;</hi> and therefore he inquired of
<hi>Porus,</hi> if the things were true that had been told him.
He confirmed <hi>Phegelas</hi> report concerning the force
of the Nation, but he ſaid their King was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
of Noble Blood, but of the baſeſt of men, his
Father being a Barber, who with great pain did get
his daily bread, until he came in favour with the
Queen, who preferred him to the King her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
who was afterwards ſlain by his Treaſon:
Then he, under a pretence to become Tutor unto
the Children, uſurped the Kingdom to himſelf, and
putting the Children to death, did beget him that
was now King, being in hatred and diſgrace with
the people, as one that followed more the manners
of his Fathers former Eſtate, then ſuch as did be ſeem
the Dignity of a Prince.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="397" facs="tcp:46658:212"/>
When <hi>Alexander</hi> heard <hi>Porus</hi> affirm this, he was
in great trouble of minde, not that he regarded the
multitude of his Enemies, or the force of their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants,
but the greatneſs of the Rivers, and the
ſcituation of the Country, ſo difficult to enter. He
thought it a hand Enterpriſe, to ſeek out Nations ſo
far inhabiting the uttermoſt bounds of the World:
Yet on the other ſide, the greedineſs of glory, and
the unſatiable deſire of Fame, made no place ſeem
too far, nor any Adventure to be over-hard: He
doubted alſo that the <hi>Macedons,</hi> who had paſſed ſo
many Countries, and were grown old in war, would
not be content to follow him over ſo many Rivers,
and againſt ſo many difficulties of Nature lying in
their way: For he judged, that ſince they abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and were laden ſo with Spoil, they would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſeek to injoy ſuch things as they had got, then
to travel any further to purchaſe more. He could
not think the ſame deſire to be in his Souldiers that
was in himſelf: for he compaſſed in his minde how
to get the Empire of the whole world, into which
he had but yet made his entry; whereas they, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with travel, and thinking to have paſt all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril,
looked to injoy with ſpeed the fruit of all their
labour: Yet for all that, his deſire at laſt overcame
his Reaſon; ſo that aſſembling his Army together,
he ſpake unto them after this manner:</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant (my Souldiers) how that there
are now many rumours ſpread amongſt you by the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
purpoſely to bring you in fear; but the vanity of
their lying is not ſo new a thing, that it is able any
more to deceive you. The <hi>Perſians,</hi> after that manner,
would have made the Streights of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and the
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:46658:213"/>
Plains of <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> terrible unto you; yea, and
put you in fear of the Rivers of <hi>Tygris</hi> and <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes;</hi>
and yet we waded over one of them, and paſſed
the other by a Bridge. Fame never reporteth things
truly, but maketh them to be greater then indeed they
are: Even our Glory, though it be grown to a certain
perfection, yet it is more in Fame then in effect.
Which of you of late did think that you ſhould have
been able to endure the Elephants, ſhewing afar off
like Caſtles? Who thought I could have paſſed the
River of <hi>Hydaſpis,</hi> when it was reported to be much
greater then it was? We ſhould long ago (my Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers)
have fled out of <hi>Aſia,</hi> if Tales could have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
us to turn our backs. Think you that the Flocks
of Elephants to be greater then the Herds of Beaſts you
have ſeen in other places, ſeeing they are ſo rare in
the world, ſo ſtrange to be taken, and ſo much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
in the making of them tame? The ſame vanity
that hath reported them to you to be of ſuch numbers,
hath numbred alſo the Horſemen and the Footmen of
your Adverſaries. Concerning the Rivers, the more
broad they are, the more gently they do run: for ſuch
as are narrow, and of ſmall breadth, are always moſt
violent in their courſe; where contrariwiſe, the broad
Rivers paſs their courſe more mildly. But you will
peradventure ſay, that all the peril is at the landing,
where your Enemies ſhall wait for your arrival:
Whatſoever the River be, the hazard is all one at the
ſhore. But imagine that all theſe things were true,
whether is it the greatneſs of the Beaſts, or the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the men, that putteth you in fear? As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Elephants, we have had experience of them
of late, how more violently they rage againſt their
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:46658:213"/>
own party, then againſt us: Why ſhould we fear them,
but only make leſs the greatneſs of their bodies with
ſuch weapons as we have prepared for the purpoſe?
What matter is it whether they are of the like num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that <hi>Porus</hi> had, or whether they are three thouſand;
ſeeing we perceive that when two or three are wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the reſt begin to fly away? And foraſmuch as they
cannot well be governed when they are but few, when
there are ſo many thouſands together, they muſt needs
be an impediment one to another, and breed a confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
amongſt themſelves; they are ſo unwieldy, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of their huge bodies, that they be neither apt to
paſs forwards, nor yet to fly: I have always ſo little
eſteemed them, that when I have had plenty of them I
would never uſe them, knowing very well, that they are
more dangerous to ſuch as imploy them, then to their
Enemies. But peradventure it is the multitude of their
Horſemen and Footmen that move you: Were you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
wont to fight againſt ſuch numbers? or is it the
firſt time you have encountred with diſordered multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes?
The River of <hi>Granike</hi> is a witneſs how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
the power of the <hi>Macedons</hi> is againſt any
multitude; and ſo is <hi>Cilicia</hi> that flowed with the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi>
blood, and <hi>Arbella,</hi> whoſe Plains are ſtrowed
with their bones. You too late begin to number the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of your Enemies, after that with your Victories
you have made <hi>Aſia</hi> a Wilderneſs: When you paſſed
over the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> you ſhould then have conſidered
your ſmall numbers: Now the <hi>Scythians</hi> do follow us,
we have did at hand from the <hi>Bactrians,</hi> and we ſupply
our power with the <hi>Sogdians;</hi> yet for all that, it is not
theſe men in whom I put my confidence: I have a regard
unto your force; I reſerve your manhood about me as a
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:46658:214"/>
Pledge and aſſurance of my atchievements: So long as
I ſtand in the field amongſt you, I will neither weigh
my ſelf, nor mine Enemies, do you but ſhew an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
that there is hope in you, and chearfulneſs:
We are not newly entred into our travels, but have
paſſed all our labours, being come unto the riſing of
the Sun, and to the Ocean Sea, except our own ſloth
be our impediment: from thence having ſubdued the
world, we ſhall return Conquerours into our Country.
Do not you as thoſe negligent Husbandmen, that loſe
their fruit after it is once ripe: The rewards of our
journey are greater then our peril: The Country into
which we are now marching is rich, and of no force;
thither I purpoſe to bring you, both to win glory, and
to get you ſpoil; for worthy are you to carry thoſe
riches into your Country, which the Sea doth there ſo
plentifully caſt them up upon their ſhore: You are men
of that vertue, as to leave nothing unprovided, nothing
undone: I deſire and conjure you, by the glory you
have gotten, in which you exceed the ſtate of men,
and by all that I have deſerved of you, and you of me,
in which we remain invincible, that you will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
me, purpoſing to viſit the end of the world: Me, I
ſay, that have been brought up as a childe amongſt you.
I will not make mention how I am your King; in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
things I have commanded you, let me now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
you once in this; It is I that make this requeſt
unto you, who never brought you on, but I put my ſelf
foremoſt in the adventure and danger, and oftentimes
with my own Buckler have defended my Army: Take
not the Victory out of my hands, by which (if envy be
not the let) I ſhall become both equal in glory to <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi>
and <hi>Bacchus:</hi> Give you aſſent to mine interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:46658:214"/>
and at length break your obſtinate ſilence: Where
is your ſhouting become, that was wont to be a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of your chearfulneſs? Where are the chearful
countenances of my <hi>Macedons?</hi> I know not you my
Souldiers, and it ſeems that I am not known of you:
I ſpeak, methinks, to your deaf ears in vain, and in
vain go about to ſtir up your unwilling and immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
mindes.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all theſe words, they hung
down their heads towards the earth, and perſevered
ſtill in ſilence: Then he proceeded.</p>
            <p>I know not <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> wherein I have unwittingly
offended you, that you will not once vouchſafe to look me
in the face: I ſeem to be ſolitary, and in a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
Is there none of you that I ſpeak unto will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
me? Is there none at the leaſt who will deny my
requeſt? What is the thing that I require? even your
own glory, and your own profit. Where are they now
whom I ſaw not long ago contending, who ſhould firſt
take up their King when he was wounded, and now you
leave me alone, you forſake me, you betray me to mine
Enemies: But I will not leave mine enterpriſe though
I go alone; leave me alone to thoſe Rivers, to thoſe
Beaſts, and to thoſe Nations, the very names of whom
you fear ſo much. The <hi>Scythians</hi> and <hi>Bactrians</hi> ſhall
go with me, who of late were mine Enemies, and who
now are my Souldiers; I had rather die then be a King
to be ruled, and at other mens appointment: Go, get
you home, go I ſay, and triumph of the abandoning
of your King; for I will here either obtain the Victory,
whereof you have deſpaired, or elſe die a death that
ſhall be honourable.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding what he ſaid, there was not one
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:46658:215"/>
Souldier that would open his mouth to ſpeak, but
ſtood waiting when ſome of the Princes and great
Captains ſhould declare unto the King, that there
remained not in them any obſtinate refuſal of the
Wars, but that they were exhauſted with wounds,
and ſo wearied with continual travel, that they were
not able to indure any longer. As they ſtood thus
aſtoniſhed, and afraid in ſilence, and looking upon
the ground, there began firſt a whiſpering and a
rumour amongſt them, and afterwards a lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and by little and little, they began more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
to ſhew their complaints, the tears falling
from their eyes. The Kings anger was then ſo turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into compaſſion, that he himſelf was not able to
abſtain from tears: At length the whole Aſſembly
burſting out into an exceſſive weeping, <hi>Cenus</hi> took
upon him to preſs forwards towards the Judgment-Seat
where <hi>Alexander</hi> ſtood, ſignifying that he had
ſomewhat to ſay: When the Souldiers ſaw him pull
his Helmet from his head, (for ſo it was the cuſtom
to ſpeak unto the King) they began to require him
that he would deliver the cauſe of the whole Army:
Then <hi>Cenus</hi> began on this manner:</p>
            <p>May the gods defend us from all wicked thoughts,
as I doubt not but that they do; there are none of your
Souldiers but are of the ſame minde towards you,
that they have been in times paſt, if it be your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to command them to go forwards to fight, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
themſelves, or with their blood to commend your
Name unto Poſterity. And if you will needs perſevere
in your Opinion, though we are unarmed, naked, and
without blood, we will either come after you, or go
before you, as you ſhall think expedient: But if you
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:46658:215"/>
will be content to hear your Souldiers griefs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
which are not fained, but expreſſed by the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

            <p>When <hi>Cenus</hi> had made an end of his Oration,
there aroſe a cry and lamentation, which in confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
voices every where call'd <hi>Alexander</hi> their King,
their Father, and their Lord. Then the other Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
(and eſpecially the more ancient of them,
who by reaſon of their age had the more honeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
and greater authority) made the like requeſt;
ſo that the King was not able in that obſtinacy,
either to chaſtiſe them, or aſſwage them: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
uncertain what to do, he leaped from the
Judgment-Seat, and commanding his lodging-door
to be ſhut, he admitted no man to come unto him,
but ſuch as were accuſtomed to be about his perſon.
Two days he conſumed in this angry melancholy,
and the third day he came forth amongſt his men,
cauſing twelve Altars of ſquare ſtone to be ſet up as
a Monument of his journey, and willed the Trenches
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:46658:216"/>
of his Camp to be made wider, and the places
where the Souldiers lay to be inlarged greater then
ſerved for the bigneſs of their bodies, thinking by
form and ſhape of things thus increaſed, to leave a
deceitful Wonder to Poſterity.</p>
            <p>From thence he returned by the way he had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
before, and incamped near unto the River of
<hi>Aceſines. Cenus</hi> chanced there to die, whoſe death
the King lamented; but yet he ſaid, that for ſo few
days he had made an over-long Oration, as though
he alone ſhould have returned into <hi>Macedon.</hi> By
that time the Navy of Ships which he had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be made, ſtood in readineſs, and aflote; and
<hi>Memnon,</hi> in the mean ſeaſon, brought him out of
<hi>Thrace</hi> 6000 Horſemen, and beſides from <hi>Harpalus</hi>
7000 Footmen, with twenty five thouſand Arms
that were wrought with ſilver and gold, which he
diſtributed amongſt his men, and commanded the
old to be burned, purpoſing to paſs unto the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Sea with a thouſand Ships: But before he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
he reconciled by Affinity <hi>Porus</hi> and <hi>Taxiles,</hi>
betwixt whom there was a new diſcord riſen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their old hatred. He had obtained of them
great aid, both in making and the furniſhing of his
Fleet.</p>
            <p>During the time he was about this buſineſs, he
builded two Cities, the one whereof he called <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea,</hi>
and the other <hi>Bucephalon,</hi> naming the latter by
the name of his Horſe that was dead. He gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that his Elephants and Carriages ſhould paſs by
Land, and he ſailed down the River, proceeding
every day about forty furlongs, ſo that he might
always land his power in ſuch places as he thought
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:46658:217"/>
convenient. At length he came into a Country
where the Rivers of <hi>Hydaſpes</hi> and <hi>Aceſines</hi> do joyn
together, and do run from thence into the bounds
of a Nation called <hi>Sobions.</hi> They declared, that
their Predeceſſors came from <hi>Hercules</hi> Army, who
being left there ſick, did inhabit the Country:
They were cloathed in beaſts skins, uſing Clubs for
their weapons: And though they had left the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> yet there appeared many
things amongſt them, that declared from whence
they were deſcended.</p>
            <p>Here the King landed, and marched two hundred
and ten furlongs within the Country, which he wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
and took the chiefeſt City in the ſame. There
were forty thouſand men that ſtood in defence
againſt him upon a Rivers ſide; but he paſſed the
water, putting them to flight; and after they fled
into the City, he wan it by force: The young men
were all ſlain, and the reſt ſold as ſlaves. After that
he aſſaulted another City, where he was repulſed
by the great force of the Defendants, and loſt many
of his men: But when the Inhabitants ſaw that he
continued ſtill the Siege, deſpairing of their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard,
they ſet fire on their houſes, and deſtroyed
themſelves, their Wives and Children; which fire
when the <hi>Macedons</hi> quenched, they kindled the
ſame again: It ſeemed a ſtrange contention, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
to deſtroy their own City, and their Enemies
labouring to preſerve it; the Wars ſo contrarily
changed the Laws wrought in man by nature: The
Caſtle was ſaved, wherein a Garriſon was left. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
went about this Caſtle by water, which
was invironed with three of the greateſt Rivers in
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:46658:217"/>
all <hi>India, Ganges</hi> excepted; <hi>Indus</hi> paſſing on the
North-ſide, and <hi>Aceſines</hi> running into <hi>Hydaſpes</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the South. Where theſe Rivers met, the waters
roſe like ſurges of the Sea, being full of Mud and
Ouze, which by the courſe of the water were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon the ſhore: for all that the Rivers are
broad, yet the Channels are but narrow, wherein
the Ships muſt paſs. The waves did riſe ſo high
and thick, breaking ſometimes upon the Poops,
and ſometime upon the ſide of the Ships, that the
Marriners began to vail their Sails; but they were
ſo troubled through fear, and the violent ſwiftneſs
of the ſtream, that they could not order their tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
ſo that two of their greateſt Ships were drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in ſight; and the ſmalleſt Veſſels, which were
leſs able to be governed, were driven upon the
ſhore without any harm. The King chanced upon
the place where the Waves ſwelled higheſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
his Ship was ſo toſſed and traverſed, that the
Helm could not direct its courſe; wherefore the
King fearing to be drowned, pulled off his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
being ready to caſt himſelf into the water,
and his Confidents did ſwim near thereabout, being
ready to receive him. It appeared to him doubtful
which peril was the greateſt, either to ſwim, or to
continue ſtill aboard. But the Marriners laboured
wonderfully with their Oars, adding all the force
that lay in mans power to cut through the Waves,
by whoſe importunate travel the water ſeemed to
divide aſunder, and to give place, ſo that at length
they got out of the ſurges; and yet not able to bring
the Ship to the ſhore, daſhed upon the next flat, it
appearing that the Ships and the Stream had fought
a Battel together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="408" facs="tcp:46658:218"/>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> having eſcaped this peril, ſet up to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
River an Altar, whereupon he offered due Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
and that done, he paſt forwards thirty fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs.
From thence he came into the Country of the
<hi>Sudricans</hi> and <hi>Mallians,</hi> who being accuſtomed to
be at war among themſelves, were then joyned in
Society. They aſſembled in Arms to the number of
nine thouſand Footmen, ten thouſand Horſemen, and
nine hundred armed Waggons; whereof when the
<hi>Macedons</hi> were advertiſed, who believed that they
had paſſed all perils, ſeeing a freſh War ariſe with
a new freſh Nation, they were amaz'd with a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
fear, and began again with ſeditious words to
repove their King: They alledged, that he would
lately have compelled them to paſs the River of
<hi>Ganges,</hi> to make war upon thoſe Nations inhabiting
beyond the ſame; which enterpriſe, though it were
left, they had not for all that ended the War never
the more, but rather made an exchange for a new
labour, being put forth amongſt this wilde Nation,
to make the Ocean Sea open to him with their
blood, and to be drawn beyond the Sun and the
Stars: They were compelled (they ſaid) to viſit
thoſe places that Nature coveted to remove from
mans knowledge: They grudged, that to their
new Armour there were new Enemies raiſed up,
whom if they ſhould vanquiſh, and put to flight,
they could not ſee what benefit they ſhould receive
thereby, but only darkneſs and obſcurity of the
Air, which always covered the deep Sea, repleniſhed
with multitudes of Monſters wallowing in thoſe
immoveable waters, in which dying Nature did
faint away.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="409" facs="tcp:46658:218"/>
The King little moved for himſelf, was much
troubled for theſe paſſions of his Souldiers: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he aſſembled them all together, declaring of
how feeble a force thoſe Nations were, whom they
feared ſo much, and who only remained, and
were an impediment to them (having paſſed over
ſo many Countries) to attain to the period of their
travels, and to the end of the world. He ſhewed
how that in reſpect of their former fear, he had left
his Enterpriſe over <hi>Ganges,</hi> with the Conqueſt of the
Nations inhabiting beyond the ſame, and had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
his journey this way; whereas their glory
ſhall be as great, and their danger leſs, ſeeing the
Ocean was in a manner within ſight, the Air where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he felt blowing in his face: He required them
therefore, that they would not envy the glory he
ſought, by paſſing the bounds of <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
ſeeing that with ſo little pain they might give
unto their King perpetual Fame and Immortality:
In doing whereof, they ſhould depart out of <hi>India</hi>
as Conquerours, whereas otherwiſe they ſhould
ſeem to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly away from thence. It is the property of
all multitudes, and ſpecially of Men of War, to be
drawn with every little motion, amongſt whom, as
ſedition doth ſoon ariſe, ſo it is ſoon pacified.</p>
            <p>There was never a more chearful cry made of any
Army before, then the Souldiers now made to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
who willed him to lead them whereſoever
he would, and make himſelf equal in glory unto
them whoſe Acts he did emulate. <hi>Alexander</hi> rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
in the willingneſs that appeared in his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
removed ſtraight ways towards his Enemies, who
were the ſtouteſt people of all the <hi>Indians.</hi> They
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:46658:219"/>
prepared themſelves manfully for the Wars, and
choſe for their Captain one of the <hi>Oxidracans,</hi>
who was of an approved Manhood; he incamping
at the foot of a Mountain, made fires all abroad, to
cauſe his number to appear the greater, and went
about in vain to fear the <hi>Macedons</hi> when they were
at reſt, by making of alarms, with their cryes and
manner of howling. When the day appeared, <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
having an aſſured confidence to obtain the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
commanded the Souldiers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to put on their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and chearfully to fall in order of Battel: But
the <hi>Indians</hi> (whether it were for fear, or by reaſon
of ſome ſedition riſen amongſt them) ſuddenly fled
into the Deſart Mountains; whom <hi>Alexander</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in vain, and not able to overtake them, took their
Carriage. After this he came to the City of the
<hi>Oxidracans,</hi> whereunto great numbers were fled, as
well in truſt of the ſtrength of the place, as of their
own power. As <hi>Alexander</hi> was about to make the
approach, <hi>Demophon,</hi> his Diviner, admoniſhed him
that he ſhould either defer the aſſault, or elſe not
meddle with it at all, for there appeared ſignes that
his life ſhould be in jeopardy. When <hi>Alexander</hi> had
heard his words, he beheld him, and ſaid:</p>
            <p>If any man ſhould interrupt thee when thou art bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
about thy Science, or conſidering of the Entrails,
ſhould not he ſeem unto thee to be troubleſome, and his
coming to be ungrateful? Yes truly <hi>(ſaid he.)</hi> So art
thou now unto me (ſaid <hi>Alexander)</hi> for having ſo
great actions in hand, of more moment then the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails
of Beaſts, I finde no greater impediment then a
Superſtitious Diviner.</p>
            <p>And as ſoon as he had ſpoken the word, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:46658:219"/>
them to rear up the Ladders; and whileſt other
men ſticked and ſtayed at the danger, he mounted
up the wall in his own perſon. The ſame was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
narrow on the top, not divided with loops, (as
is commonly uſed) but incloſed with one whole and
continual Battlement round about, which cauſed
it to be the more hard to ſcale: <hi>Alexander</hi> therefore
having no convenient place to ſtand for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
ſtayed upon the wall, receiving upon his
Target the Darts that were caſt at him from all
parts. His Souldiers could not get to him, they were
ſo beaten from the walls by the ſhot that came
from above: Yet at the laſt, when they ſaw their
King given up into their Enemies hands, ſhame
overcame their imminent danger. But their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
haſte became their hinderance, and was the
cauſe why they could not come to the reſcue of their
King: For whiles every man coveted to aſcend the
Ladders, they were ſo heavily laden, that they brake
aſunder; and ſuch as were mounted upon them fell
down again, deceiving <hi>Alexander</hi> of his only
hope: ſo that in the ſight of all the Army he ſtood
deſtitute on the walls, as in a Deſart, without any
aid or ſuccour, and had wearied his left arm (with
which he held his Target) in receiving the Darts
thrown at him. His friends cryed unto him to leap
down unto them, who ſtood in readineſs to receive
him: But he giving no car unto them, undertook
an incredible enterpriſe, and ſuch a one as hath not
been heard of before, deſerving rather the report
of raſhneſs, then of any fame that might ſound to his
glory; for with a deſperate leap he caſt himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the City that was full of his Enemies: For before
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:46658:220"/>
he could recover his feet again, it was likely either
he ſhould have been ſlain, or taken alive. But he by
chance ſo conveyed his body, that he fell upon his
feet, and fought with ſuch as came againſt him: For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
ſo provided, that he could not be encloſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
by reaſon of an old tree, which as it had been
of purpoſe ſtood near the wall, whoſe broad boughs
being full of leaves, covered him from above; and the
greatneſs of the ſtock kept his enemies from coming
at his back; and upon the forefront he received the
darts that were caſt againſt him with his Target. For
though there were never ſo many that contended
with him afar off, yet durſt there no man come near
unto him; and the boughs kept off the arrows and
darts as well as his Target did.</p>
            <p>In this extremity, the greatneſs of <hi>Alexanders</hi>
Fame chiefly fought for him, and next of all deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
a great encouragement for a man to die ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly.
At length, through the multitude of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
that continually flocked about him, both his
Target was laden with ſhot, his Helmet was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with ſtones, and his legs fainted and failed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him by reaſon of his continual travel: which
when his enemies perceived, they without fear
drew more near unto him; of whom he received
two with his ſword in ſuch ſort, that they fell down
dead at his feet: and from that time forward none
was ſo bold to approach ſo neer him, but threw
Darts, and ſhot Arrows at him afar off. He lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to every mans blow, and yet (though with
great pain) defended himſelf upon his knees, until
ſuch time as an Indian ſhot an Arrow at him that
was two Cubits long, which a little above his right
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:46658:220"/>
thigh paſſed through his Corſlet; by reaſon of which
wound he ſhed ſo much bloud, that he let his ſword
fall, as one at the point of death; and therewith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
ſo faint, that he had not ſtrength to pluck out
the Arrow. Then the Indian which had hurt him
came with great joy to ſpoil his body: but when
<hi>Alexander</hi> felt his enemies hand upon him, moved
(as it is to be thought) with deſpite to receive an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy
to that extremity, he called again his ſpirits
that were paſſing away, and with his ſword thruſt
his enemy (being unarmed) through the body.
When he had thus ſlain three of his enemies, who
lay dead before him, all the reſt ſtood amazed afar
off. Then <hi>Alexander</hi> deſiring before his laſt breath
ſhould fail to be killed fighting, began to raiſe up
his body upon his Target; but his ſtrength would
not ſerve him thereunto, and therefore he reached
at a bough that hung over his head, coveting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to have raiſed himſelf; but his ability not ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, he fell down again upon his knees, and by
a ſigne given with his hand, challenged his enemies
if any of them durſt come and fight with him. At
the laſt <hi>Peuceſtes</hi> repulſing his enemies on another
part of the walls, got into the Town; and coaſting
along, came unto the place where the King was.
When <hi>Alexander</hi> eſpied him, though he had no
hope to live, yet he took his coming for a comfort
to his death, and for all his feebleneſs began to rear
up himſelf. Then came <hi>Timeus,</hi> and within a while
<hi>Leonatus,</hi> and after them <hi>Ariſtonus.</hi> When it was
once publiſhed amongſt the Indians, that <hi>Alexander</hi>
was entred within the walls, they left their defence
in other places, and came flocking thither, where
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:46658:221"/>
they fiercely aſſailed ſuch as ſtood in defence of the
Kings perſon. <hi>Timeus,</hi> after he had fought nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
and received many wounds, was there ſlain:
<hi>Peuceſtes</hi> alſo, notwithſtanding that he was ſtricken
and wounded with their Darts, yet with his Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
he defended the Kings perſon, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of himſelf: And <hi>Leonatus,</hi> whiles he reſiſted
the <hi>Indians</hi> that eagerly ran upon <hi>Alexander,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ſo ſore a blow on the neck, that he fell down
in a ſwound at the Kings feet. By that time <hi>Peuce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes</hi>
became ſo feeble of his wounds, that he was not
able to defend him any more: The laſt hope and
refuge remained in <hi>Ariſtonus,</hi> who alſo was ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly
wounded, that he could not endure any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
the force of the <hi>Indians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean ſeaſon the fame was ſpread amongſt
the <hi>Macedons,</hi> that the King was ſlain; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a matter that ſhould have put others in fear,
ſtirred up their hearts, and made them the hardier:
For from that time forwards, there was none that
had reſpect of his own peril, but adventured unto
the wall; and breaking down the ſame with Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axes,
entred in at the breach, making ſlaughter of
their Enemies, of whom few ſtood at defence, but
fled away.</p>
            <p>There was neither man, nor woman, nor infant
ſpared; for whomſoever they met, they judged
him to be the perſon that had hurt their King; and
ſo at length, with the ſlaughter of the multitude,
their juſt anger was ſatisfied. <hi>Clitarchus</hi> and <hi>Tima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi>
do write, that <hi>Ptolomeus,</hi> who afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was preſent in this encounter:
But he himſelf, that uſed not to deny any thing
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:46658:221"/>
that ſtood with his own glory, did put in memory
how that he was then abſent, being imployed on
another Enterpriſe. Such a negligence was then
in thoſe who did write the Antiquities of things, or
ſuch a credulity, which is a fault no leſs than the
other. When <hi>Alexander</hi> was brought into his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Chirurgeons cut off the ſtale of the ſhaft,
in ſuch ſort that they moved not the head that was
within the fleſh; and when they ſaw the wound
bare; they perceived hooks to be on the Arrow-head,
ſo that without the deſtruction of his body it could
not be pulled out, except by inciſion they made the
wound greater; and yet in that point they feared,
leſt blood flowing too abundantly, ſhould be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
unto them; for the head was very great,
and it ſeemed to be entered far within his body.
There was one <hi>Critobulus</hi> that was very cunning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
moſt excellent amongſt the Phyſicians and Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons;
and yet in ſo dangerous an accident as this,
he was fearful and in doubt to undertake the Cure,
leſt if any thing ſhould cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce to the King other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than well, whileſt he remained under Cure,
the blame thereof might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight upon his head; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when <hi>Alexander</hi> perceived by his weeping the
fear he was in, and that through trouble of minde
he looked pale in the face, he ſaid unto him:</p>
            <p>What is it that thou lookeſt for? Or why doſt thou ſtay
in ridding me quickly out of this pain, at the leaſtwiſe
by death, if thou canſt not otherwiſe bring it to paſs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
For ſeeing my wound is incurable, why feareſt thou that
any thing ſhould be laid to thy charge?</p>
            <p>When <hi>Critobulus</hi> heard his words, he either cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
or diſſembled his fear, and exhorted <hi>Alexander</hi>
               <pb n="416" facs="tcp:46658:222"/>
that he would ſuffer himſelf to be held while they
pulled the Arrow-head that was within his fleſh; for
the leaſt motion he ſaid might be hurtful unto him.
The King would not be held, but kept his body at a
ſtay without moving, in ſuch ſort as they appointed
him. When they had cut the wound wider, and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
out the head, there iſſued out ſuch abundance
of blood, that the King fell in a ſwoon, and a dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
came over his ſight, and he ſtretched out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
as one in the pangs of death. Then they
wrought all the means they could to ſtanch the
blood; but when they perceived it would not avail,
his friends began to weep and lament, thinking ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
there had been no way but death. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
at length he ceaſed his bleeding, and recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
again his ſpirits, began to know them that ſtood
about him.</p>
            <p>All that day, and the night enſuing, the men of
War ſtood in arms about the Kings lodging, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
that all their lives depended upon his breath;
and would not remove from thence before they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
that he took ſome reſt: but when they
knew that he was fallen in a ſleep, they returned
into the Camp, bringing unto the reſt more certain
hope of his recovery. <hi>Alexander,</hi> about the curing
of his wound, remained there ſeven days, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
that a conſtant fame of his death was
ſpread abroad amongſt the <hi>Indians,</hi> he cauſed two
Ships to be faſtened together, and a Lodging to be
made for him in the middeſt; ſo that remaining up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the water, from both ſides of the land he might
be ſeen of them that thought he had been dead.
When the <hi>Indians</hi> perceived he was alive, it took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:46658:222"/>
the hope that ſome had conceived upon the falſe
Report.</p>
            <p>From thence he paſſed down the ſtream, leaving
a diſtance between his Ship and the reſt of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
to the intent that with the beating of the Oars,
they ſhould not diſturb him of his reſt, which was
neceſſary for his weak body. The fourth day after
his embarquing, he came into a Countrey abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the Inhabitants, but plentiful both in Corn
and Cattel, in which place he thought to reſt himſelf
and his Souldiers. It was a cuſtom amongſt the
<hi>Macedons,</hi> that when their King was diſeaſed, the
chief Princes and the great Men watched about his
Lodging; which cuſtom being then obſerved, they
entred all together into the chamber where <hi>Alexander</hi>
lay; at whoſe ſudden coming he was ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed,
eſpecially becauſe they came all together. He
thought they had brought him ſome ſtrange tidings,
and enquired of them if they underſtood of any
new Aſſembly of his Enemies. Then <hi>Craterus</hi> that
was appointed to ſpeak in the behalf of them all,
ſpake unto him after this manner.</p>
            <p>Do you think that the coming of any Enemies could
make us ſo careful (though they were entred within your
Camp) as we are of your health and ſafeguard, though,
of all, this is the thing which you regard leaſt? Though
all Nations conſpire againſt us with their Power, though
the whole world were filled full of men of War, the Seas
overſpread with Ships, and never ſo many ſtrange beaſts
brought againſt us, it conſiſteth in the preſence of your
Perſon to make us Conquerours. But how can any God
promiſe that you, who are the Light and Star of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi>
can be of any continuance? ſeeing you are ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:46658:223"/>
to put your perſon in ſuch manifeſt perils, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
that with your death you draw with you into
ruine the lives of ſo many of your Countrey-men? Who
is he that either can, or doth deſire to live after you? We
are come ſo far following your Fortune and Authority,
that, without you, none of us are able to return home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
If you were yet contending with <hi>Darius</hi> for the
Kingdom of <hi>Perſia,</hi> though we all would wiſh you would
not adventure your perſon ſo perillouſly, yet in that caſe
we could not marvel ſo much at your prompt reſolution;
for where the danger and the benefit that enſueth thereof
are equal, the fruit is the greater when the buſineſs ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
well, and the comfort is the more when the thing
chanceth evil. There are none, not only of us who are
your Souldiers, but even of ſuch as were your Enemies,
having any underſtanding of your greatneſs that can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
ſo baſe a town, and of ſo little fame, to be bought with
the price of your life. My heart ſhrinks at the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the danger which we but late did ſee with
our own eyes; I am amazed to rehearſe how thoſe vile
hands were in a readineſs to have carried the ſpoils of
your invincible Perſon, if Fortune of her clemencie had
not preſerved and delivered you from their crueltie. So
many of us as were not able to follow you, are all Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and Forſakers of our Prince: And though it was a
matter that lay not in our power, yet if it pleaſe you to
note us all with reproach, there is none that will refuſe
any puniſhment in the purgation of it; notwithſtanding,
we would require you, that you would ſpare us for ſome
other purpoſe. We will gladly go whitherſoever you
will have us; we require War be it never ſo obſcure, and
covet the Battel, though our fighting ſhall want Fame,
ſo that you will reſerve your ſelf to thoſe hazards which
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:46658:223"/>
are correſpondent for the greatneſs of your eſtate. How
ſoon doth glory vaniſh away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and become of no praiſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
ſuch Enemies as are of no reputation? And what
thing is there more unworthy, than to conſume the glory

glory cannot appear?</p>
            <p>When <hi>Craterus</hi> had ended his ſpeech, <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and
the others ſpake to him to the like effect, and all at
once with weeping eyes required of him, that he
would not from thenceforth be any more ſo thirſty
to win praiſe, but ſeeing he had gotten ſufficient
already, he ſhould content himſelf therewith, and
regard his health and ſafety, whereon their univerſal
eſtate did depend. The King took ſo gratefully
their loving affection, that he familiarly embraced
every one of them; and after he had willed them to
ſit, revolving in his minde more deeply their former
communication, he ſaid thus unto them:</p>
            <p>My faithful loving Friends and Country men, I ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
you moſt hearty thanks, not only that you prefer
my Safety before your own, but alſo that ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Wars you have not pretermitted any
thing, wherein your love and benevolence might be
ſhewed towards me; ſo that I muſt confeſs that my life
was never ſo dear unto me as it is now, becauſe I deſire
long to enjoy you. You are deſirous to offer your ſelves
to death in my cauſe, becauſe you judge that I have
deſerved that benevolence at your hands; but your
imagination and mine is not after one way: You
peradventure do covet to enjoy me, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

which my Father left me, and with the eaſe of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
within the bounds of <hi>Macedon,</hi> have looked for an
obſcure and ignoble old age; and yet I cannot ſee that
they who live in ſloth and idleneſs can aſſure themſelves
of their own deſtiny; For even ſuch as eſteem felicity in
long life, are oftentimes prevented with ſudden death:
But I, who number not my years but by my Victories,
have lived long, if I well weigh the gifts of Fortune:
For beginning mine Empire in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> I have
<hi>Greece</hi> in my poſſeſſion; I have ſubdued <hi>Thrace</hi> and
<hi>Illyria,</hi> I reign over the <hi>Tribals</hi> and the <hi>Medians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Maſter of all <hi>Aſia</hi> that lieth between <hi>Helleſpont</hi>
and the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> and now am not far from the end of
the world; the which I determined to viſit, and to lay
open to men a new nature, and a new world: I paſſed
out of <hi>Aſia</hi> into <hi>Europe</hi> in the moment of an hour, being
but eight and twenty years of age, and having reigned
but nine years, and I am now become the Victorer of both
Regions; Do you think it then meet that I ſhould now
ceaſe from the purchaſe of that glory whereunto I have
only devoted my ſelf? No, I will never ceaſe, but
whereſoever I ſhall have occaſion to fight, I ſhall think
my ſelf to be in the Theater, where the whole world
doth behold me. I will give Nobility and Fame to
places that are obſure, and will lay open to all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
thoſe Countries which Nature hath removed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt
from them; in doing whereof, it ſhall be grateful
for me to end my life, if Fortune will have it ſo: I am
come of ſuch a Stock, that I ought to deſire many things
before long life. I pray you to remember that we are
come into theſe Countries, where the name of a Woman
is celebr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

what great Works did ſhe accompliſh? We are not yet

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Woman in glory; and yet you
would have me to be ſatisfied with it. Be the gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
unto our purpoſe; for there remains for us yet
greater things to do. And it is the next way to make
thoſe Countries which we have not yet touched to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ours, if we eſteem nothing to be of ſmall value
where there is any occaſion to purchaſe glory. Let it be
your care to preſerve me from the evil conſpiracy of my
own people, and then there are no adventures in the War
ſhall put me in fear. <hi>Philip</hi> was more ſure in the
Front of the Battel abroad, than in the Theatre at
home; he oftentimes avoided the force of his Enemies,
but he could not eſchew the violence of his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
And if you conſider the end of other Kings, you
ſhall number more that have been ſlain by their own
men, than by any Forreign power: But becauſe there is
an occaſion now offered me to utter that which I have
long conceived in my minde, it ſhall be the greateſt fruit
I can receive of my travels, if my Mother <hi>Olympias,</hi>
when ſhe departeth this life might be conſecrated to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie:
if ſhe depart in my time, I will do it my
ſelf; but if I ſhall be prevented by death, remember
you to perform what I have determined.</p>
            <p>Having ſpoke theſe words, he diſmiſſed his Friends
from him, and continued many days in the ſame
place. Whileſt theſe things were doing in <hi>India,</hi> the
<hi>Greek</hi> Souldiers that had lands and habitations ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
them at <hi>Catabactria,</hi> through a ſedition that
chanced amongſt them, rebelled againſt him, not
ſo much for any hate they did bear to <hi>Alexander,</hi> as
for fear of puniſhment; For they killed divers of
their chief Rulers, and aſſembling in force together,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:46658:225"/>
took the Caſtle of <hi>Bactria</hi> that was negligently kept,
and procured the <hi>Bactrians</hi> to rebel with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Athenodorus</hi> was the Chief among them, who took
upon him the name of a King, not ſo much for the
deſire of the Kingdom, as by authority to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of power to convey himſelf and others home in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his own Country: But one <hi>Bicon</hi> of his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
became his Enemy, and conſpiring againſt him,
did invite him to a Banquet, where he was ſlain by
one <hi>Boxus Macerianus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day following, <hi>Bicon</hi> aſſembled the
<hi>Greeks</hi> together, perſwading them that he ſlew
<hi>Athenodorus</hi> but in his own defence, whoſe purpoſe
was to have deſtroy'd him. But there was ſome that
perceived his policy, and the ſuſpition was ſpread
amongſt the reſt, ſo that the <hi>Greeks</hi> fell to arms on
purpoſe to ſlay <hi>Bicon:</hi> But ſuch as were chief, miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
the wrath of the multitude; and contrary to
his expectation, he was delivered from that preſent
peril: Yet he could not be ſo contented, but within
a while after he conſpired them that ſaved his life;
whoſe falſhood being known, they took both him
and <hi>Boxus,</hi> determining that <hi>Boxus</hi> ſhould be put to
death out of hand, and that <hi>Bicon</hi> ſhould end his life
by torments.</p>
            <p>As they were tormenting him, the <hi>Greek</hi> Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
ſuddenly in a fury, for what cauſe it is uncertain,
ran to arms; the noiſe of whom being heard by them
who had the charge of <hi>Bicon,</hi> they ſet him at liberty,
fearing that the coyl had been raiſed for his deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
He, naked as he was, came running amongſt
the <hi>Greeks</hi> where they were aſſembled; whoſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
eſtate ſo changed their mindes, that they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:46658:225"/>
him immediately to be ſet at liberty. By this
means <hi>Bicon</hi> being twice delivered from death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
into his Country with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> abandoning
the Colony whereunto he was appointed by <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
Theſe things were done in the Confines of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctria</hi>
and <hi>Scythia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean ſeaſon, the King of the two Nations,
which we ſpake of before, ſent an hundred Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
unto <hi>Alexander,</hi> who being honourable Perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
did ride in Waggons richly apparelled, having
garments of linnen Cloth embroidered with Gold,
and empaled with Purple. They declared that the
cauſe of their coming was to yield themſelves, their
City, their Country, and their Liberties (which
they had kept inviolately for ſo many Ages) to his
will and appointment; of which their ſubmiſſion
the gods (they ſaid) were Authors, and not any
fear; for they were contented to yield themſelves
before they had proved their power with him. The
King called a Councel, and received them under his
protection, appointing them to pay ſuch Tribute as
they did before pay to the <hi>Arachoſians,</hi> and beſides
to ſend two thouſand five hundred Horſemen to ſerve
him in his Wars; all which things they performed
obediently. This done, he made a great Feaſt,
whereunto he invited thoſe Embaſſadours, and his
Lords: he uſed therein ſumptuous preparation, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
an hundred Beds of Gold to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at upon, which
being ſet a ſmall diſtance one from another, were
drawn about with Curtains garniſhed with Gold
and Purple.</p>
            <p>In that Feaſt there was ſhewed and ſet forth all
the great exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſs and voluptuouſneſs, which either by
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:46658:226"/>
long cuſtom was uſed amongſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> or by
corruption was taken up amongſt the <hi>Macedons,</hi> the
vices of both theſe Nations being there mingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
There was at that Feaſt one <hi>Dioxippus</hi> of
<hi>Athens,</hi> a noble Champion, and by reaſon of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
force, well known unto the King, of whom
certain envious and malicious perſons, betwixt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
and jeſt, ſaid, <hi>That he did nothing but fat his body
like an unprofitable beaſt; and when others went to the
Battel, he would anoint his body with Oyl, and prepare
himſelf to eat.</hi> Amongſt others that uſed evil words
of deſpite againſt him, there was at the ſame Feaſt
one <hi>Horratus</hi> a <hi>Macedon,</hi> who in his drunkenneſs
challenged <hi>Dioxippus, that if he were a man, he ſhould
fight the Combate with him the next day, upon life
and death, where the King ſhould judge either him to
be raſh, or the other too much a Coward. Dioxippus</hi>
laughing to ſcorn the pride and arrogancy of the
Souldier, accepted his proffer. The next day they
were more earneſt to go unto the Combate than they
were before in making the Challenge: when the King
ſaw them ſo bent, and that they would not leave
their purpoſe, he conſented to their will.</p>
            <p>There were great numbers of men aſſembled at
the Combate, amongſt whom, there were many <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
who favoured <hi>Dioxippus</hi> part. The <hi>Macedon</hi>
came into the Liſts armed at all points, holding in
his left hand an Iron Buckler and a Spear, and in
his right hand a caſting-Lance; and having his
Sword girt to his ſide, was furniſhed as though he
ſhould have fought with many men at once. <hi>Diox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ippus</hi>
came forth anointed with Oyl, with a Garland
upon his head; and having a red Cloth wrapt about
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:46658:226"/>
his left arm, he held in his hand a great knotty Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.
The diverſity of their Weapons brought every
man into a wonderful expectation; for they thought
it not only a raſhneſs, but a madneſs for <hi>Dioxippus</hi>
who was naked, to encounter the other who was
armed. The <hi>Macedon</hi> thinking to kill his adverſary
before they ſhould come to fight hand to hand, threw
at him his Lance, which <hi>Dioxippus</hi> avoided by bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his body; and before that he could charge his
Pike, he leaped to him, and with his Cudgel brake
the ſame aſunder: when the <hi>Macedon</hi> had loſt both
his Weapons, he began to draw his Sword; but <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xippus</hi>
prevented him with a cloſe, and taking both
his feet from under him, threw him upon the earth,
and there plucking his Sword from his ſide, ſet his
foot upon his neck, and held up his Cudgel to have
ſtruck out his brains, if the King had not cauſed him
to ſtay his hand.</p>
            <p>This Triumph ended with diſpleaſure both unto
the <hi>Macedons,</hi> and unto <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf, eſpecially
becauſe this thing was done in the preſence of the
<hi>Indians;</hi> fearing leſt the valour of the <hi>Macedons,</hi>
famed ſo much in the world, might thereby grow
into contempt. Hereupon <hi>Alexander</hi> grudging at
<hi>Dioxippus,</hi> had his ears open to the Accuſation of
thoſe who did envy him. They, within a few days
after, had cauſed a golden Cup purpoſely to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
out of the way, which the Miniſters having
imbezelled, they made complaint to <hi>Alexander</hi> of
the loſs thereof. Oftentimes men ſhew leſs conſtancy
in their countenance, than in the offence it ſelf; for
in their complaint <hi>Dioxippus</hi> perceiv'd by their looks
that they noted him as the Thief; which he could
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:46658:227"/>
not endure, but parting out of the Feaſt (after he had
written a Letter to the King) he killed himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> was very ſorry for his death, which he
took for no token of repentance, but rather of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
For it afterwards appeared, through the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermuch
rejoycing of his Enemies, that he had been
falſly accuſed. The Embaſſadours of the <hi>Indians</hi>
that were diſmiſſed home, within a few days after
returned again, preſenting unto <hi>Alexander</hi> three
hundred Horſes, one thouſand and thirty Waggons
every one drawn with four Horſes, certain Veſtures
of Linnen-cloth, a thouſand <hi>Indian</hi> Targets, and
one hundred Talents of Iron, Lions of a rare big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and Tygers that were tame, the Skins of great
Lizards, and the Shells of certain Fiſhes.</p>
            <p>The King then commanded <hi>Craterus</hi> to conduct
his Army along the River whereupon he ſailed, and
embarquing ſuch as were accuſtomed to accompany
him, he with the ſtream paſſed into the Bounds of
the <hi>Mallians,</hi> and from thence came unto the <hi>Sabra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi>
who were a Nation of great power, not ruled
by Kings, but by a Government of the People. They
had gathered together ſix thouſand Footmen, and
ſix thouſand Horſemen, and five hundred armed
Waggons, and had choſen three Captains that were
approved men of War: But when ſuch as inhabited
next unto the River (the Banks being full of Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges)
ſaw all the River, as far as they could view,
over-ſpread with Ships, and the Armour gliſtering
of ſo many men of War, they were amazed at the
ſtrangeneſs of the fight, and thought that ſome Army
of the gods, or elſe <hi>Bacchus</hi> (whoſe name was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
amongſt thoſe Nations) had been come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:46658:227"/>
them. The cry of the men of War, with the
claſhing of the Oars, and the ſtrange noiſe of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
exhorting one another, filled their fearful
ears. They ran therefore amongſt their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who had aſſembled their Forces, declaring
their madneſs if they would contend with the gods;
for they ſaid the Ships could not be numbred that
carried thoſe invincible people: with which words
they put ſuch fear amongſt the men of their own
Nation, that they ſent immediately Embaſſadours
to yield themſelves.</p>
            <p>When he had received their ſubmiſſion, he came
the fourth day into another Country, the people
whereof durſt no more withſtand him than the other
did; and there he builded a City, which he named <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria:</hi>
and from thence he entred into a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
the inhabiters whereof they call <hi>Muſicans,</hi> there
he underſtood by the accuſation of the <hi>Paromiſidans,</hi>
that <hi>Deſteriores</hi> (whom <hi>Alexander</hi> had appointed
Lieutenant amongſt them) had ruled in exceſſive
pride and covetouſneſs, and therefore he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him to be put to death: And <hi>Oxiartes</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of the <hi>Bactrians</hi> being alſo accuſed, was not
only acquitted, but had a greater Rule committed
unto him.</p>
            <p>When he had ſubdued the uttermoſt part of the
<hi>Muſicans,</hi> he put a Gariſon into their City, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
from thence into another Nation of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
called <hi>Preſtians;</hi> of whom <hi>Oxicanus</hi> was King,
who with a great Power retired himſelf into a ſtrong
City, which <hi>Alexander</hi> won the third day after he
began his Siege: Upon the taking of the Town, <hi>Oxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus</hi>
fled into the Cſtle, and ſent Embaſſadours to
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:46658:228"/>
treat for peace; but before they were come to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi>
preſence, two Towers of the Caſtle fell with a
great noiſe, by the ruines whereof the <hi>Macedons</hi> got
into the Caſtle, where <hi>Oxicanus</hi> with a few ſtanding
at defence, was ſlain.</p>
            <p>The Caſtle being razed, and all that were within
ſold as ſlaves, <hi>Alexander</hi> came into the bounds of
<hi>Saba,</hi> where beſide many Holds that yielded to him,
he took the ſtrongeſt City of that Country by force
of a Myne. It ſeemed a wonderful thing to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
being ignorant of ſuch Policies of War, for
armed men to come forth of the ground in the midſt
of their City, where there appeared no ſigne of any
way under the Earth. <hi>Clitarchus</hi> doth write, that
there were eighty thouſand <hi>Indians</hi> ſlain in that
Country, beſides many priſoners ſold as ſlaves. The
<hi>Muſicans</hi> in the mean time rebelled; for the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of whom <hi>Python</hi> was ſent thither, who took the
Prince of the Nation priſoner, and brought him to
<hi>Alexander,</hi> whom he cauſed to be hanged upon a
Croſs as the Author of the Revolt; which done, he
returned again to the River where he had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his Navy to tarry for him. The fourth day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he came to a Town at the entrance into the
Kingdom of <hi>Samus,</hi> the King whereof had newly
yielded himſelf; but the Citizens had ſhut their
Gates, and would not be at his Commandment;
whoſe ſmall number <hi>Alexander</hi> regarded ſo little,
that he ſent five hundred <hi>Agrians</hi> unto their Gates
to proffer them Skirmiſh, to the intent that by reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
they might draw them by little and little out
of their ſtrength, thinking they would follow the
Chaſe, when they ſhould ſee their Enemies flying.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="429" facs="tcp:46658:228"/>
The <hi>Agrians</hi> did as they were appointed; and
when they had once provoked their Enemies, they
immediately turned their backs, and the <hi>Indians</hi>
purſued them, until they came to the Ambuſcado
where the King lay in perſon; then the <hi>Agrians</hi> tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and the Fight was renewed ſo fiercely, that
of three thouſand <hi>Indians,</hi> there were five hundred
ſlain, and a thouſand taken, the reſt recovered the
City: but the end of the Victory was not ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
as the beginning; for the <hi>Indians</hi> had ſo enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomed
their Arrows, that ſuch as were hurt died of
the wounds: and the Phyſicians could not deviſe the
cauſe of ſo ſtrange a death; for even the lighteſt hurts
were incurable. The <hi>Indians</hi> truſted that <hi>Alexander</hi>
through his raſhneſs might have come within that
danger, who by chance fighting amongſt the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
eſcaped unhurt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ptolomy</hi> was lightly wounded upon the left ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and being in a greater danger than the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his wound ſhewed, cauſed the King to be
careful of him; for he was near of kin unto him,
and ſome thought that <hi>Philip</hi> was his Father; but it
is certain that his mother was <hi>Philip</hi> his Concubine:
He was one of them that had the charge of the
Kings perſon, a valiant man of War, and yet more
famous in the arts of Peace: he was moderate both
in his apparel and living; liberal, eaſie to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to, and without any ſuch height of minde, as
is accuſtomed to be in men deſcended of the Royal
Blood; by reaſon of which qualities, it is uncertain
whether he was better beloved of the King, or of
the Souldiers.</p>
            <p>This was the firſt occaſion he had to prove how
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:46658:229"/>
the mindes of men were affectionate towards him;
for even in that danger, the <hi>Macedons</hi> began to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
of his fortune, whereunto afterwards he aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
They had no leſs care of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> than of the
King himſelf; who uſed him ſo familiarly, that when
he was wearied either with travel or care of minde,
he would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it for his ſolace with <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and at that
time caus'd his bed to be brought into his own cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
When <hi>Ptolomy</hi> was laid there, he fell ſuddenly
in a ſound ſleep, in the which it ſeemed that a Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon
offered to him an herb out of his mouth, for the
healing of his wound, and taking away of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome.
When he awaked, he declared his dream,
and ſhewed both the colour and faſhion of the herb,
affirming that he could know it, if any man could
finde it out. This herb was ſought by ſo many, that
at length it was found; and being put upon the
wound, the pain ſtaightways ceaſed, and the ſcar
within ſhort ſpace was cloſed. When the <hi>Indians</hi>
were diſappointed of the hope they had conceived
that way, they yielded themſelves and their City.</p>
            <p>From thence <hi>Alexander</hi> went into the next Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
called <hi>Parthalia,</hi> the King whereof called <hi>Meris</hi>
left the City, and fled into the Mountains, ſo that
<hi>Alexander</hi> took the ſame, finding a wonderful prey
of Sheep, of Cattel, and of Corn. There he took
Pilots that knew the River, and came unto an Iſland
which ſtood in the midſt of the ſtream, where he
was compelled to remain the longer, becauſe the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots
being negligently kept, were eſcaped away. He
ſent therefore to ſeek out others; but when he could
finde not any, there entred a vehement deſire into
his head to viſit without any Guide, the Ocean-Sea,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:46658:229"/>
and the end of the world, committing his own life,
and the lives of ſo many thouſands, to a River which
none of them did know. They ſailed as men igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of all places they came unto, either how far the
Sea was diſtant from them, what Nations did inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
the Countries thereabouts, or whether the Mouth
of the River were navigable for Gallies, or not. In
all theſe things they were led by a blinde and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
imagination, having no other comfort in their
raſh Enterprize, but only that they truſted to their
continual felicity. When they had gone forwards
four hundred Furlongs, the Ship-maſters told the
King, that they felt the air of the Sea, whereby they
knew the Ocean was at hand. Thereat he rejoyced
greatly, and exhorted the Mariners that they would
with all the power they could, make way with their
Oars, to bring him to the ſight of the end of the
World, which he had ſo long deſired.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>our Glory is perfect, when our
manhood is ſuch that nothing can ſtay us: now the
World is come into our hands without any further
hazard of War, or ſhedding of Bloud. Now ſince
the Bounds that Nature hath wrought be ſo near at
hand, we ſhall ſhortly ſee things unknown, ſaving to
the immortal gods.</hi> Yet notwithſtanding he ſet
ſome men upon the Land to take ſome of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men,
by whom he truſted to have known the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of the truth. When they ſearched out their
Cottages, at length they found out ſome of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
who were hidden, who being demanded how far
the Sea was from them, they made anſwer, that they
never heard it named; but they ſaid, that within
three days ſayling, they ſhould come unto a place
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:46658:230"/>
where a brackiſh water did corrupt the freſh; by
which words the Mariners underſtood that they
meant the Sea, of the nature whereof the people
were ignorant: then the Mariners rowed chearfully,
their deſire growing ever the greater, as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
near unto the place which they hoped to
be the end of their travel. On the third day they
came where the Sea and the River joyned together,
mixing with a ſmall floud their waters that were of
a contrary nature: Then becauſe the tide was
ſomewhat againſt them, they haled towards another
Iſland ſtanding in the midſt of the River, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an eaſie place to land at, the <hi>Macedons</hi> ran about
to ſeek Victuals, in ſurety as they thought, being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the chance that came upon them.</p>
            <p>About three of the clock, according to its ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
courſe, the tide came rowling in from the Sea,
and with his force did drive the ſtream backward,
which at the firſt being but ſtayed, was afterwards
ſo vehemently repulſed, that it cauſed the water to
return backward with greater fury then a ſwift
ſtream is accuſtomed to run. The common ſort
that knew not the nature of the Ocean, thought the
ſame to be a wonderful thing, and that it had been a
token ſent to them of Gods wrath: and while they
were in that imagination, the Sea ſwelling more
and more, overflowed the Land which they ſaw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dry; and as the water mounted, the Ships and
all the Navy was diſperſed here and there. Such as
were upon land were amazed with the ſuddenneſs of
the event, and ran from all parts in great fear unto
their Ships. But in a tumult, haſte doth always
hart, and giveth impediment. Some there were that
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:46658:230"/>
went about to ſet forward their Ships; others for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bade
rowing, and removed not at all; otherwhiles
they made haſte away, and would not tarry to take
in their company, and they moving but ſlowly could
make no way. Some, when they ſaw them preſs on
Ship-board in ſuch throngs, for fear of taking in too
many, would receive none at all; ſo that both the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
and the ſmall number were an equal impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unto the haſte they made. The cry that ſome
made in bidding men tarry, and the noiſe that others
made in willing them to go forwards, with their
voices that differed, and agreed not in one effect,
took away the uſe both of their ſight and hearing.
The Mariners could not help it, whoſe words in the
tumult could not be heard, nor their commandments
obſerved amongſt men in fear and out of order. The
Ships therefore did beat one againſt the other, the
Oars craſhed aſunder, and every Ship either thruſt
forward or did put back one another. No man would
have judged it to be one Fleet, but rather two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies
ſighting a Battel upon the Sea. The Sterns did
ſtrike againſt the poop; ſuch as went before, troubled
them that came after; and at laſt the words of men
in their choler came unto blows. The tide had now
over-flown all the Plains thereabout, ſo that nothing
appeared above the Waters ſave the Hills, which
ſeemed ſo many little Iſlands, whereunto many did
ſwim, and left their Ships for fear.</p>
            <p>Whileſt the Navy was thus diſperſed abroad, and
partly floated as they hapned in any valley, and
partly ſtuck in the ground as they lighted on the
flats; there came ſuddenly another terrour greater
then the firſt: For when the Sea began to ebbe, the
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:46658:231"/>
water fell back again into his wonted courſe, with
ſo great violence as it came forwards, and reſtored
the ſight of the Land, which before was drowned as
in a deep Sea. The Ships then forſaken of the water,
fell upon their ſides, and the Fields were ſtrewed with
broken boards and pieces of Oars. The Souldiers
durſt not go forth to Land, and yet were in doubt
to tarry on Ship-board, looking ever for ſome grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
miſchief to come, then what they ſaw preſent
or paſt. They could ſcarcely believe what they ſaw
and ſuffered, which was a Shipwrack upon the land,
and a Sea within a River. They thought no end
could come of this calamity; for they knew not that
the Sea ſhould ſhortly return again, and ſet their
Ships afloat: And therefore they propoſed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Famine and all extremities. The Monſters
alſo of the Sea, which after the water was paſt, were
left on dry land, did put them in great fear.</p>
            <p>The night approached, and deſpair brought the
King into a great agony: yet no care could ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
his heart, that was invincible, but he watched
all night, and ſent Horſemen to the mouth of the
River, to bring him word when the tide came. He
cauſed two Ships that were broken to be amended,
and ſuch as were overwhelmed to be hoiſed up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
warning all men to lie in wait, and be in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs
againſt the water ſhould ariſe. When he had
conſumed all that night in watching and giving ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
unto his men, ſtraightways the Horeſemen
returned on a main gallop, and the tide at their
heels, which mildly increaſing, began to raiſe again
their Ships; and when it had once over-flown the
Banks, the whole Navy began to move. Then all
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:46658:231"/>
the Coaſt rebounded with the unmeaſurable rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
that the Souldiers and Mariners made for their
ſafeguard, whereof they were before in deſpair.</p>
            <p>When they ſaw the danger paſt, they inquired
one of another, by what reaſon the Sea could ſo ſoon
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bb and flow; and debated the nature of that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which one while diſagreed, and another
while was obedient and ſubject to the time. The
King conjecturing by the ſignes he had ſeen before,
that after the Sun-riſing the tide would ſerve to his
purpoſe, at mid-night with a few Ships did ſail down
the Stream; and paſſing out at the mouth of the
River, he entred four hundred Furlongs into the
Sea; and being Maſter of his deſires, he there made
ſacrifice to the gods of the Sea, who were worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in thoſe Countries, and returned again unto
his Navy. On the next day he returned backwards
againſt the Stream, and arrived at a ſalt Lake, the
nature whereof being unknown, deceived many
that raſhly entred into the water; for their bodies
by and by became full of ſcabs; which diſeaſe taken
by ſome, the contagion thereof infected many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
but they found that Oyl was a remedy for
the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> lying ſtill with his Army, waiting for
the Spring of the year, ſent <hi>Leonatus</hi> before by Land
where he thought to paſs, to dig Wells, becauſe
the Country was very dry, and deſtitute of water.
In the mean time, he builded many Cities, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<hi>Nearchus</hi> and <hi>Oneſicritus</hi> (that were moſt
expert in the Diſcipline of Sea-ſervice) with his
ſtrongeſt Ships to paſs into the Ocean, and to go ſo
far forwards as they might with ſurety, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:46658:232"/>
the nature of the Sea; and willed them at
their return, to land either within that River, or
elſe within <hi>Euphrates.</hi> When the Winter was well
paſſed, he burned thoſe Ships which were unſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable,
and conveyed his Army by Land. After
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine Incampings he came into the Country of the
<hi>Arabitans,</hi> and from thence in nine days came into
the Country of the <hi>Gedroſians,</hi> who being a free Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by a general Counſel had amongſt them, yielded
themſelves; of whom there was not any thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
ſaving only Victuals.</p>
            <p>The fifth day he came into a River, which the
Country-men call <hi>Barabon,</hi> beyond which there lay
a barren Country, greatly deſtitute of water,
through the which he paſſed, and entred amongſt
the <hi>Horitans.</hi> There he betook the greater part of
his Army to <hi>Epheſtion,</hi> and divided the Souldiers
that were light armed to <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and <hi>Leonatus;</hi> and
ſo they waſted the Country with three Armies at
once, and took a great booty. <hi>Ptolomy</hi> turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Sea, <hi>Leonatus</hi> on the other hand, and
<hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf in the midſt. In that Country
he builded alſo a City, and brought men out of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rachoſia</hi>
to inhabit it. From thence he came amongſt
the <hi>Indians,</hi> who, lying upon the Sea-coaſt, do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit
a great Country that is waſte and deſart.
They uſe no Traffique, Commerce, nor Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with any of their Neighbours: but the deſart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their Country made them ſavage, being wilde
of their own nature. Their nails and hair are never
cut: they made their Houſes of the Shells of Fiſhes,
and of other things that the Sea caſteth up; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
clad with the skins of wilde Beaſts, do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Fiſhes dried with the Sun, and ſuch Monſters as the
Sea doth caſt upon the Land.</p>
            <p>Here the <hi>Macedons</hi> conſumed their Victuals, and
firſt endured ſcarcity, and afterwards extream hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
ſearching out in every place the roots of the
Palms, which is the only Tree that groweth in that
Country: But when that kinde of nouriſhment fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, they killed their Carriage-beaſts, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained
not from their Horſes; inſomuch that lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Beaſts to bear their Baggage, they were infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to conſume with fire thoſe Spoils of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
which had cauſed them to travel into the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt
bounds of the Orient. After their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
there followed a Peſtilence; for the unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
nouriſhment of the unwholeſome meat
they did eat, with the travel of their journey, and
the anxiety of their mindes, did ſpread Diſeaſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them in ſuch ſort, that they could neither
continue in a place, nor yet go forwards without
great deſtruction: Hunger oppreſſed them when
they tarried, and the Peſtilence was more vehement
ever as they went forwards. The Fields therefore
were ſtrewn full of men that were half dead and half
alive; and ſuch as were but half ſick were not able
to follow the Army, it marched with ſo great a
ſpeed: For every man thought ſo much to further
his own ſafety, by how much he made haſte to get
before his fellows.</p>
            <p>Such as fainted and could not follow, deſired
both ſuch as they knew and knew not, to help them
forwards: but they had no Beaſts whereupon to ſet
them, and the Souldiers (who had the imminent
miſchief that fell upon other men, repreſented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:46658:233"/>
their own eyes) could hardly bear their own
Arms; wherefore when they were called upon, they
would not vouchſafe once to look back, fear had
ſo taken away all compaſſion from them. Then they
who were left behinde, cried upon the gods and their
King for help, alledging, That they were all of one
Country and Religion, which was a Band for one
to relieve another: But when they had cried long
in vain unto their deaf ears, through deſperation
they raged, wiſhing the like end to their Friends and
Companions which they themſelves endured.</p>
            <p>The King poſſeſſed both with ſorrow and ſhame,
becauſe he and none elſe ſhould be the cauſe of ſo
great a deſtruction amongſt his men, did write to
<hi>Phrataphernes,</hi> Ruler of the <hi>Parthenians,</hi> to ſend to
him upon Camels, Victuals ready to be eaten; and
certified the Princes of the Countries round therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
of his neceſſity, who did ſlack no time, but
made proviſion according to his will. Thus his
Army delivered only from Famine, was brought
within the bounds of the <hi>Gedroſians;</hi> and foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as the ſame was a Country fertile of all things,
he thought good to ſtay there a while, with reſt to
recover again his feeble Souldiers.</p>
            <p>There he received Letters from <hi>Leonatus,</hi> that he
had won the Victory of the <hi>Horitans,</hi> who encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
him with eight thouſand Footmen, and five
hundred Horſemen. He was advertized from <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus.</hi>
That he had taken and put in hold <hi>Ozines</hi> and
<hi>Zariaſpes,</hi> two Noble-men of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who went about
to rebel. <hi>Alexander</hi> alſo underſtanding that <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
was dead, gave the charge of the Country
whereof he had the rule, unto <hi>Siburtius,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:46658:233"/>
marched into <hi>Carmania. Aſpaſtes</hi> was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of that Nation, who being ſuſpected of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation
whiles <hi>Alexander</hi> was in <hi>India,</hi> met him
on the way: But <hi>Alexander</hi> diſſembling his wrath,
entertained him gently, and gave unto him his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
honour, till ſuch time as he had better proof
of the accuſation which was laid againſt him.</p>
            <p>When the Princes of <hi>India,</hi> according to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
had ſent out from all their Countries
great plenty of Horſes, and other Beaſts, both for
Saddle and Draught, he gave Carriage again to
all men that wanted, and reſtored their Armour to
the former beautifulneſs and excellency: for they
were come into a Country joyning upon <hi>Perſia,</hi>
which was both abundant in all things, and alſo
quietly eſtabliſhed under his ſubjection. He thought
it then a time to counterfeit <hi>Bacchus,</hi> in the glory
and fame which he got amongſt thoſe Nations. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were a Triumph that <hi>Bacchus</hi> firſt inſtituted,
or a paſtime uſed of him in drunkenneſs, <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
was determined to counterfeit his Acts, having
his minde elevated above the eſtate of man. He
commanded therefore all the Villages through the
which he was to paſs, to be ſtrewed with Flowers
and Garlands, and Wine to be ſet forth at every
mans door, for all men that would drink. He
cauſed Waggons alſo to be made, of largeneſs able
to carry great numbers, and decked the ſame with
precious Furniture. The King went foremoſt with
his Friends, and next to them his Guard, wearing
upon their heads Garlands of Flowers, ſome play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon Flutes, ſome upon Harps: every one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
through the Army adorned his Chariot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:46658:234"/>
to his ability and ſubſtance; and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the whole day in Banquetting, did hang their
rich Armour beſide them. <hi>Alexander,</hi> with ſuch as
he called to his Company, was carried in a Chariot,
laden with Cups of Gold, and other golden Veſſels;
and with his drunken Army he marched thus ſeven
days together, in oſtentation of the prey they had
gotten; wherein they ſhewed ſuch diſſoluteneſs, that
if one thouſand of the ſubdued people had given
them the onſet, they might have taken them Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and led them away in triumph. But Fortune,
which hath appointed both Fame and Eſtimation to
things, turned all this diſorder unto his Glory: for
both the Age that was then, and the Poſterity that
came after, marvelled, and took it for a wonder, that
he durſt go ſo diſſolutely among thoſe Nations, not
yet eſtabliſhed under his Empire; the barbarous Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
reputing his Raſhneſs for an aſſured Confidence.
But ſhedding of bloud enſued after this Triumph:
For Prince <hi>Aſpaſtis</hi> (ſpoken of before) was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be put to death: So that his exceſs in Volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuouſneſs,
was no let unto his Cruelty, nor his
Cruelty an impediment to his Voluptuouſneſs.</p>

ſuch an univerſal ſpoil, not abſtaining from Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,

complained of them, lamenting the ſhame

               <hi>Alexander</hi> hearing the Cauſe, ſaid, <hi>that the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
overſlipt the greateſt Offence, which was the deſpair

that he ſhould ever have returned out of</hi> India,
<hi>they durſt never</hi> (he ſaid) <hi>have committed any ſuch hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous

priſon, and ſix hundred Souldiers to death, who had
been the Miniſters of their cruelty; and they alſo
were executed the ſame day, whom <hi>Craterus</hi> had
brought as Authors of the Rellellion out of <hi>Perſia.</hi>
Within a while after, <hi>Nearchus</hi> and <hi>Oneſicritus,</hi>
who had been commanded by the King to ſearch
the Ocean-ſea, returned to him, declaring ſome
Diſcoveries by knowledge, and ſome by report:
They ſhewed him of an Iſland not far from the
mouth of <hi>Indus,</hi> which abounded with Gold, and
had no breed of Horſes amongſt them; wherefore
the Inhabitants would give a Talent for every Horſe
brought from the Main-land. They alſo told him
of great and monſtrous Fiſhes (whereof thoſe Seas
were full) which carried down with the Tide,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:46658:235"/>
would ſhew their bodies as big as a great Ship, and
follow the whole Fleet with a terrible noiſe; and
when they dived underneath the water, they trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
the Seas, as it had been a Ship-wrack. Theſe
were things they had ſeen; the reſt they received by
the report of the Inhabitants: as how the Red-ſea
took his name of King <hi>Erithrus,</hi> and not of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of the Water. They ſhewed alſo another River
not far from the Main-land, growing full of Palm-trees,
where was a great Wood, and in the midſt
thereof ſtood a Pillar, where King <hi>Erithrus</hi> was
buried, with an Inſcription on it of ſuch Letters as
were uſed in that Country.</p>
            <p>They added beſides, That ſuch Veſſels as carried
the Merchants, and the Vaſſals of the Army, through
the covetouſneſs of the Gold which had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
unto them, were landed in the Iſland by the
Mariners, and were never ſeen after. Theſe words
moved <hi>Alexander</hi> much, and put him in a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to get more certain knowledge of thoſe parts;
and therefore he commanded them again to Sea,
willing that they ſhould coaſt the Land, till they
came within the River of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and from
thence to come up to <hi>Babylon</hi> againſt the Stream.
The things were infinite that he compaſſed in his
head: for he determined after he had brought the
Sea-coaſt of the Orient under his ſubjection, to go
out of <hi>Syria</hi> into <hi>Africk,</hi> for the envy he bare to the
<hi>Carthaginians;</hi> he purpoſed from thence to paſs
over the Deſarts of <hi>Numidia,</hi> towards the <hi>Gades,</hi>
where he underſtood by fame that <hi>Hercules</hi> had
planted his Pillars; and ſo directing his Journey
through <hi>Spain</hi> (the which the <hi>Greeks</hi> of the River
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:46658:236"/>
               <hi>Iberus</hi> call <hi>Iberia)</hi> to go over the <hi>Alps</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi>
till he ſhould come to the Coaſt where the next paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
was unto <hi>Epirus.</hi> For this intent he gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
to his Officers in <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> That they
ſhould cut down Materials in Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> and
convey the ſame to <hi>Capſagas,</hi> a City in <hi>Syria,</hi> and
there make Gallies of ſuch greatneſs, that every one
of them might be able to carry ſeven Oars upon a
Bank; and from thence he willed them to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
unto <hi>Babylon.</hi> He alſo ſent commandment to
the King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> to furniſh them with Iron,
Hemp, and Sails.</p>
            <p>Whiles theſe things were in doing, he received
Letters from <hi>Porus</hi> and <hi>Taxiles,</hi> ſignifying, That
<hi>Abiazares</hi> was dead of a Diſeaſe, and that <hi>Philip</hi>
his Lieutenant in thoſe parts was ſlain, they being
put to death who were the Actors of it. <hi>Alexander</hi>
in the place of <hi>Philip</hi> preferred <hi>Eudemon</hi> that was
Captain of the <hi>Thracians,</hi> and gave <hi>Abiazares</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to his Son. From thence he came to <hi>Paſargades,</hi>
a Country of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> whereof <hi>Orſines</hi> was Lord,
who in Nobility and Riches exceeded all other men
in thoſe parts, as one that derived his Pedegree from
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> that once was King of <hi>Perſia.</hi> The Riches his
Predeceſſours left him were great, and he by a long
continuance in his Inheritance and Authority had
much increaſed the ſame.</p>
            <p>He met <hi>Alexander</hi> coming thitherwards, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
both him and his Friends with Gifts of ſundry
ſorts, which were a multitude of young Horſes ready
to be backed, Chariots wrought with gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
precious Moveables, excellent Pearls, and ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Stones, weighty Veſſels of Gold, Robes of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:46658:236"/>
and four thouſand Talents of coyned Silver.
But this his liberality was the occaſion of his death:
for when he had preſented all the Kings Friends with
Gifts above their deſire, he honoured not <hi>Bagoas</hi> the
Eunuch with any Gifts at all, whom <hi>Alexander</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
favoured for the uſe of his body, by which he
did oblige the King unto him: There were therefore
ſome that gave him admonition how much <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
eſteemed <hi>Bagoas;</hi> but he anſwered them,</p>
            <p>That his cuſtom was to honour the Kings Friends,
and not his Minions; and that it was not the manner
of the <hi>Perſians</hi> to have any in eſtimation, who did pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
themſelves in ſo ſhameful an abuſe.</p>
            <p>When his words were reported to the Eunuch, he
uſed the Power which he had got by diſhoneſt Arts,
to the deſtruction of that noble and innocent man;
for he did ſuborn certain lewd perſons of <hi>Orſines</hi>
Country, to bring in falſe Accuſations againſt him,
which he warned them to preſent at ſuch a time as
he ſhould appoint unto them. In the mean ſeaſon,
whenſoever <hi>Bagoas</hi> got the King alone, he would fill
his credulous ears with tales againſt <hi>Orſines;</hi> ever
diſſembling the cauſe of his diſpleaſure, leſt thereby
he might loſe the reputation of his falſe report.</p>
            <p>The King had not <hi>Orſines</hi> yet in ſuſpition of ſuch
a Crime as afterwards he was charged with; but he
began to grow with him out of eſtimation. His ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation
was ever ſo ſecret, that he could never get
knowledge of the peril that was privily wrought
againſt him. This importunate Favourite, in his
vile converſation had with the King, was mindful
ever of the malice he bare to <hi>Orſines,</hi> whom he
would not ceaſe to bring in ſuſpition of Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:46658:237"/>
and Rebellion, ſo oft as he ſaw <hi>Alexander</hi> bent
to uſe him familiarly. And now the falſe Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were in readineſs, which he had prepared to the
deſtruction of the innocent, whoſe fatal deſtiny,
which did approach, could not be avoided.</p>
            <p>It chanced that <hi>Alexander</hi> cauſed the Tomb
wherein <hi>Cyrus</hi> Body was buried to be opened, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to uſe certain Ceremonies for the dead, but
thinking in very deed that his Tomb had been full
of Gold and Silver; whereof there was a conſtant
fame amongſt the <hi>Perſians:</hi> But when it was view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
there was nothing found but a rotten Target,
two <hi>Scythian</hi> Bows, and a Scimiter. <hi>Alexander</hi>
cauſed the Coffin wherein <hi>Cyrus</hi> Body was laid, to
be covered with the Garment which he himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to wear, and ſet thereupon a Crown of
Gold; marvelling that the ſumptuouſneſs uſed in
burial of ſuch a King, endued with ſo great Riches,
was no more then in the burial of an ordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
When this thing was in doing, <hi>Bagoas</hi> ſtood
next unto <hi>Alexander,</hi> and beholding him in the face
ſaid unto him:</p>
            <p>What marvel is it though the Sepulchres of Kings be
empty, when Lords Houſes are not able to hold the Gold
that they have taken out from thence? For my part, I
never ſaw this Tomb before; but I have heard <hi>Darius</hi>
report, That there were three thouſand Talents buried
with <hi>Cyrus.</hi> From hence <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> proceeded <hi>Orſines</hi>
liberality, in winning your Favour by the gift of that
which he knew he could not keep.</p>
            <p>When he had thus ſtirred up <hi>Alexanders</hi> wrath
againſt <hi>Orſines,</hi> he preſented them whom he had
ſuborned to accuſe him; by whoſe report, and by
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:46658:237"/>
               <hi>Bagoas</hi> informations, <hi>Alexander</hi> was ſo incenſed
againſt <hi>Orſines,</hi> that he was put in priſon before he
could ſuſpect he was accuſed. The Eunuch was
not contented with the deſtruction of this innocent
man, but at his death laid violent hands upon him;
unto whom <hi>Orſines</hi> ſaid, <hi>I have heard that Women in
times paſt have reigned, and born great rule in</hi> Aſia;
<hi>but it is now a more ſtrange thing that an Eunuch
ſhould have the Empire in his hands.</hi> This was the
moſt Noble of all the <hi>Perſians:</hi> He was not only an
innocent man in this matter, but ſuch a one as did
bear ſingular affection unto <hi>Alexander,</hi> and had
ſhewed great liberality to him and his. At the ſame
time <hi>Phradates,</hi> who was ſuſpected to have gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to make himſelf King, was put to death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> began then to be much inclined to the
ſhedding of bloud, and to be credulous in hearing
of falſe reports: of ſuch a force is Proſperity to
change a mans nature, wherein few men have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of Vertue. Thus he who a little before
would not condemn <hi>Linceſtes Alexander,</hi> when he
was accuſed by two Witneſſes, and ſuffered divers
of more mean eſtate to be acquitted, though it vexed
him that they ſeemed not guilty to other men;
thus he who beſtowed Kingdoms upon his Enemies
whom he had ſubdued, was in the end ſo much alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from his former inclination, that againſt his
own appetite, at the will of a vile Minion, he would
give Kingdoms unto ſome, and take away Lives
from others.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time he received Letters of the
Affairs in <hi>Europe,</hi> whereby he underſtood that
whiles he was in <hi>India, Zopyrius</hi> his Lieutenant in
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:46658:238"/>
               <hi>Thrace</hi> made an Expedition againſt the <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tes,</hi>
where by Storms and Tempeſts that ſuddenly roſe
upon him, he was deſtroyed and all his Army.
When <hi>Suthes</hi> underſtood the defeat of that Army,
he procured the <hi>Odriſians</hi> that were his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to revolt; ſo that all <hi>Thrace</hi> was in a manner
loſt thereby, and <hi>Greece</hi> it ſelf ſtood in no great
ſafety.</p>
            <p>The Writers of the Acts of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great,
make mention in this place of <hi>Calanus</hi> an <hi>Indian,</hi> a
man very famous in Philoſophy, who by the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of King <hi>Taxiles,</hi> followed <hi>Alexander,</hi> and ended
his life after a ſtrange manner: When he had lived
threeſcore and thirteen years without any Diſeaſe,
at his coming into <hi>Perſia</hi> he felt a pain in his belly,
by which conjecturing that the end of his life was
come, leſt ſuch a perpetual felicity as he had lived in
ſhould be interrupted by any long Diſeaſe, or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by the multitude of Medicines which Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
do uſe to adminiſter, he required <hi>Alexander</hi>
that he would cauſe a Fire to be made, that he
might burn himſelf in the ſame.</p>
            <p>The King began to diſſwade him from his purpoſe,
thinking to have withdrawn him from the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſo horrible an act; but when he perceived
with what ſtedfaſtneſs and conſtancy he upheld his
reſolution, and that there was no way to keep him
any longer in life, he ſuffered a Fire to be made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his will, into which <hi>Calanus</hi> did ride on
horſeback, making firſt his Prayer to the gods of
his Country; and taking the <hi>Macedons</hi> by the
hands, required them that they would ſpend that
day pleaſantly in banquetting with their King,
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:46658:238"/>
whom not long after he ſaid he ſhould ſee at <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he had ſpoken theſe words, he went chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
into the Fire; and carrying his body in a
comely poſture, he kept ſtill the ſame geſture and
countenance at his death, which he was accuſtomed
to do in his life. When the Fire flamed, the
Trumpet ſounded, and the Men of War made ſuch
a ſhout as they were accuſtomed to do when they
joyned in Battel with their Enemies, which rebound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to the skies; the Elephants alſo made a terrible
noiſe. Theſe are the things which grave Writers
do teſtifie of <hi>Calanus,</hi> who was a notable Example
of an invincible minde, and conſtantly bent to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
adverſity.</p>
            <p>From thence <hi>Alexander</hi> advanced to <hi>Suſa,</hi> where
he took to Wife <hi>Statira,</hi> the eldeſt Daughter of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
whoſe youngeſt ſiſter called <hi>Dyrpetis,</hi> he gave
in marriage unto <hi>Epheſtion,</hi> and beſtowed fourſcore
Virgins of the Nobleſt of all the Nations he had
conquered, to the principal <hi>Macedons,</hi> and to the
chief of his Friends, becauſe he would not ſeem
alone to begin ſo ſtrange a Cuſtom. Theſe Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
were celebrated after the <hi>Perſian</hi> manner, and
a magnificent Feaſt prepared at the Eſpouſals, at
which there were nine thouſand Gueſts preſent, to
every one of whom <hi>Alexander</hi> gave a drinking Cup
of Gold. At the ſame time the Rulers of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
whom <hi>Alexander</hi> had ſubdued and builded, ſent
unto him thirty thouſand young Souldiers that were
all of one age, furniſhed with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Armour, and fit
for any Enterprize of the War, whom he called <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony,</hi>
that is to ſay, Succeſſours. The <hi>Macedons</hi> at
their coming ſeemed to be ſomewhat appalled, who
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:46658:239"/>
wearied with long War, uſed often in their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
to murmur, and ſpeak mutinous words
againſt their King; for which cauſe he prepared
theſe Souldiers to reſtrain the arrogancy of the
others, and gave them great benevolences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harpalus,</hi> to whom the King had committed the
charge of the Treaſure and Revenues at <hi>Babylon,</hi>
hearing of the Acts that <hi>Alexander</hi> had done in
ſubduing the greater part of the Kings of <hi>India,</hi> and
his ſucceſs to be ſo proſperous that nothing could
withſtand him, knowing the unſatiable deſire that
was in <hi>Alexander</hi> to viſit far Countries, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
his Glory, thought it ſhould be a hard matter
for him to return to <hi>Babylon</hi> again: Wherefore he
gave himſelf to delight and riot, miſuſing many
that were Noble and free-women, and wallowed in
all kind of voluptuouſneſs; inſomuch that he ſent
for a famous Harlot called <hi>Potonice,</hi> to whom he both
gave many great and Princely Gifts while ſhe was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,
and alſo after her death ſpent thirty Talents on
her Tomb.</p>
            <p>Having in theſe and ſuch other voluptuous Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
conſumed a great part of the Treaſure, when
he underſtood that <hi>Alexander</hi> was come out of <hi>India,</hi>
and did execute Juſtice upon his Officers, who miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed
them over whom they had the Rule (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
he was privy to his foul Conſcience) he feared
the like might fall on himſelf: And therefore ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
together five thouſand Talents, and ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
mercenary Souldiers, he took his way towards
<hi>Athens,</hi> no man being willing to receive him by the
way. When he came to <hi>Tenaron</hi> (where a great
number of the mercenary <hi>Greeks</hi> who had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:46658:239"/>
out of <hi>Aſia</hi> were aſſembled) he left his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
there, and went to <hi>Athens</hi> with his Money.</p>
            <p>When he was come thither, a great number of
Citizens flocked about him; but more for love of
his Money, than for any reſpect unto himſelf: but
eſpecially the Oratours, whom by ſmall Rewards he
eaſily corrupted to defend his Cauſe before the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
But afterwards, at a general Aſſembly, he
was commanded to depart the City; and ſo he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
again among the <hi>Greek</hi> Souldiers, by whom
he was ſlain. After that, with thirty Ships they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
over to <hi>Sunium,</hi> which is a point of Land in the
Territory of <hi>Athens,</hi> from whence they determined
to have entred into the Haven of the City.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being known, <hi>Alexander,</hi> who was
much moved as well againſt the <hi>Athenians</hi> as againſt
<hi>Harpalus,</hi> prepared a Navy to make War in perſon
immediately againſt them. As he was buſied about
it, he underſtood by ſecret Letters, both how <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palus</hi>
had been in <hi>Athens,</hi> and had corrupted with
Money the chief of the City, and alſo how after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
by a Council of the People, he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to depart from thence, and returning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the <hi>Greek</hi> Souldiers, he was betrayed and
ſlain by one of them. Theſe news greatly rejoyced
<hi>Alexander,</hi> whereby he had occaſion to leave off his
Journey into <hi>Europe;</hi> but he ſent commandment
to all the Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> that they ſhould receive
all their baniſhed men, ſuch only excepted as had
committed any murder on their own Country-men.
Although the <hi>Greeks</hi> kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>w this to be the breach of
their Laws and Liberties, yet as men that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> not

<pb n="452" facs="tcp:46658:240"/>
men, and reſtored to ſuch of them their Goods who
did remain: Only the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who evermore
defended obſtinately the Liberties of their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and who had not been accuſtomed to live
under the obedience of any King, but under the
Laws and Cuſtoms of their Country would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
that ſuch dregs of men ſhould live amongſt
them, but did drive them out of their bounds; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to ſuffer any thing, rather than to receive ſuch
who ſometime were the vomit of all their City, and
the refuſe of the Outlaries.</p>
            <p>The time was come that <hi>Alexander</hi> now intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to diſmiſs his old Souldiers, and to ſend them
home into their Country; but he willed firſt thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
thouſand Footmen and two thouſand Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to be choſen out, to remain ſtill in <hi>Aſia,</hi> which
he judged might be kept with a ſmall Army, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
(he thought) the many Gariſons he had
planted, and the Cities which he had newly build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and filled with Inhabitants, would be able to
awe ſuch as ſhould attempt any Rebellion. But
before he would diſtinguiſh who ſhould depart, and
who ſhould remain, he cauſed a Proclamation to be
made, <hi>That all Souldiers ſhould declare their debts
(wherewith he perceived many of them to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
burdened); and though it did riſe through
their own exceſs, yet he was determined to diſcharge
every man.</hi> But the Souldiers thinking it had been
but a device to finde who were moſt prodigal, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed
the time, and brought not in their Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>The King perceived ſhame to be the cauſe thereof,
and not diſobedience or obſtinacy; and therefore he
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:46658:240"/>
cauſed Tables to be ſet up through his Camp, and ten
thouſand Talents to be brought forth; of all which
Treaſure, when their Debts were paid, according to
the juſt accompt, there remained of Talents no more
but an hundred and thirty: Whereby it appeared,
That they who were the Conquerours of ſo many
rich Nations, brought out of <hi>Aſia</hi> more Glory than
Spoil. After it was once known that ſome ſhould
be diſmiſſed, and ſome remain behinde, they thought
the King would have eſtabliſhed his Kingdom perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
in <hi>Aſia:</hi> Wherefore like madmen, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful
of all Diſcipline of War, they filled the
Camp full of ſeditious words, and came to the King
more arrogantly, and with greater violence than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they did before, and all with one voice required
to be diſcharged, ſhewing him the hoarineſs of their
hair, and their faces deformed with ſcars. And herein
they could not be ſtaid, either by chaſtiſement of
their Officers, or by any reverence of their King; but
when he would have ſpoken unto them, they would
not ſuffer him to be heard, but diſturbed his Speech
with their tumultuous cry, and violent throng, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting,
<hi>That they would never move one foot forwards
to any place, except it were towards their own Country.</hi>
After ſome hours (becauſe they thought that <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
would incline to their purpoſe) they kept ſilence,
and ſtood in expectation what he would do. Then
<hi>Alexander</hi> ſpake thus unto them:</p>
            <p>What meaneth this ſo ſudden a conſternation of your
minde, and this ſo petulant and ſo wilde an inſolence?
I am afraid to ſpeak unto you, you have ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
broken your obedience towards me. I am now become
a King at the appointment of my People; you have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:46658:241"/>
left me the libertie to ſpeak unto you, nor to know
you, nor to exhort you, nor to behold you. Being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to ſend ſome into their Country, and to bring
the reſt with me ſhortly after, I ſee thoſe who are to be
diſmiſſed, to cry out and mutiny, as well as thoſe who
I appoint to ſtay with me. What is the meaning of
this? The cry is all alike everywhere, although the
Cauſe is divers. I would fain know whether they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
that depart, or they that are to tarry?</p>
            <p>When he had ſpoken thoſe words, they cried all
(as it had been with one mouth) <hi>All, All, All.</hi> Then
he ſaid;</p>
            <p>Truly it cannot be ſo; nor can I be perſwaded that
you ſhould all be grieved for the cauſe you declare, ſeeing
it toucheth not the greateſt part of you; for I have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
more to depart, then to remain with me. There
muſt needs be ſomething of worſe conſequence then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,
that you ſhould turn away from me. When
was it ever ſeen, that a whole Army hath forſaken
their King? The Slaves run not from their Maſters all
at once; but there is alwaies a ſhame in ſome to leave
him, when the reſt forſake him. But why do I forget
that you are deſperately mad? why do I go about to
cure thoſe that are uncurable? I condemn from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
all the good hope that ever I conceived of you, and
am determined to deal no more with you as with my
Souldiers (ſeeing you will not be mine) but as with men
ungrateful, and unmindful of my goodneſs. The cauſe
of this your madneſs is even the abundance of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity,
whereby you forget your old eſtate, from which

            <p>When he had ſpoken theſe words, he leaped in
a fury from the Judgment-ſeat, and ran into the
throng of the armed men, where he took with his
own hands ſuch as had mutined moſt againſt him;
of whom there being not any that durſt make reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
he delivered thirteen to his Guard to be
ſafely kept. Who would have thought that an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
who a little before had ſpoken unto their
Prince with ſuch audacity and rigour, could have
been ſo ſuddenly appalled with fear; and ſeeing their
Companions led to execution, durſt none of them
make the leaſt attempt to oppoſe him? But the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
liberty they uſed before, and ſeditious vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
was then ſo ſtaid, that not one of them
durſt reſiſt the King, running amongſt them, but
were all aſtonied for fear, and ſtood like men ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
with doubtful imaginations, looking what he
would determine of themſelves. Whether it were
the reverence they bare to his Name, becauſe the
Nations that live under Kings are accuſtomed to
honour them as gods; or whether it were the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
of his Perſon, or elſe his own aſſured Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
executing his Authority with ſuch violence, that
did put them in ſuch fear: but they ſhewed a notable
example of Patience; for they not only not ſtirred
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:46658:242"/>
at the execution of their Companions, whom they
knew to be put to death in the night-time; but were
more diligent in performing their duties than they
were before, pretermitting nothing pertaining to
obedience, and the natural affection towards their
Prince: For on the next day they came to the Court,
and being not ſuffered to enter, but all ſhut out ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Souldiers of <hi>Aſia,</hi> they made a ſorrowful
cry and lamentation, which ſpread over all the
Camp, proteſting, <hi>That they would not live, if the
King continued ſtill in his wrath.</hi> But he that was
obſtinate in all things which he had once conceived
in his head, having commanded the <hi>Macedons</hi> to
keep ſtill in their Camp, did aſſemble the ſtrange
Souldiers together; to whom, by an Interpreter, he
made this Oration.</p>
            <p>At what time I came firſt out of <hi>Europe</hi> into <hi>Aſia,</hi>
my truſt was to bring many noble Nations and a great
power of Men under my Empire and Dominion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I was not deceived: For beſides that Fame reported
you to be the men of Valour, I have found in you one
thing more, which is an in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>parable Obedience, Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and Affection towards their Prince. I thought
Voluptuouſneſs had o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>flown all Vertues amongſt you,
and that through your great felicitie you had been
drowned in Pleaſures: But I finde otherwiſe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that none do obſerve the Diſcipline and Order of the
Wars better than you, nor execute the ſame with more
activity and reſolution; and being manful and valiant
men, they embrace Fidelitie as well as Fortitude. This
I do but now confeſs, but I knew it long ago: which
was the cauſe that I choſe you out of the Youth of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Nations, to be my Souldiers, and did incorporate you
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:46658:243"/>
amongſt mine own People, cauſing you to wear the
ſame Armour; but your Obedience towards Authoritie
appeareth much better in you, than in them: Therefore
I have joyned to my ſelf in Marriage the Daughter of
<hi>Oxares,</hi> who is a <hi>Perſian,</hi> not diſdaining to beget Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
upon a Captive: And afterwards deſiring abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
to increaſe the Iſſue of my body I took to Wife
the Daughter of <hi>Darius,</hi> and was the Author that my
near Friends ſhould beget Children upon their Captives;
minding by this holy Covenant to exclude the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the Conquerour and the Conquered.
Wherefore you muſt now think, that you are not Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
by me adopted, but more natural; and that <hi>Aſia</hi>
and <hi>Europe</hi> is one Kingdom, without any difference. I
have given unto you Armour after the manner of the
<hi>Macedons:</hi> I have brought all ſtrangeneſs and novelty
into a cuſtom; and now you are both my Country-men
and my Souldiers; in all things receiving one form
and faſhion. I have not thought it unſeemly for the
<hi>Perſians</hi> to ſhadow the Cuſtoms of the <hi>Macedons,</hi> nor
for the <hi>Macedons</hi> to counterfeit the <hi>Perſians,</hi> ſeeing
they all ought to be under one Law and Cuſtom, who
ſhould live under one King.</p>
            <p>When he had made this Oration, he committed
the cuſtody of his Perſon unto the <hi>Perſians;</hi> he
made them of his Guard, and his Officers of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
by whom when thoſe <hi>Macedons</hi> who had
given the occaſion of this Sedition were led bound
unto Execution, one of them who was more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and of greater eſtimation than the reſt, ſpake
after this manner:</p>
            <p>How long will you give place unto your will, in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
us after this ſtrange manner? Your Souldiers
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:46658:243"/>
and your own Country-men are drawn to Execution by
their own Priſoners, before their cauſe is heard. If you
have judged us worthy of death, at leaſtwiſe change the
Miniſters of your wrath.</p>
            <p>This was a good admoniſhment, if he had been
patient to hear the truth; but his wrath was grown
into a fury, ſo that when he ſaw thoſe who had the
charge of them to ſtay a little, as willing to reſpite
the Execution, he cauſed the Priſoners to be tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
into the River, and there drowned. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the cruelty of this puniſhment, the
Souldiers were not moved to any ſedition, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
in great numbers to their Captains, and unto
ſuch as were near about the King, requiring, <hi>That
if there yet remained any infected with the ſame Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
that he ſhould command them to be put to death;
proffering their bodies to be puniſhed, and executed at
his own will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After it was known that the dignity of being the
Kings Lieutenant was given unto the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and
that they were diſtributed into divers Orders, with
ſuch names given unto them as were unto the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,</hi>
and that the <hi>Macedons</hi> were rejected with
reproach; they could not then longer contain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
nor the dolour they had conceived in their
hearts; but with a great throng pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſed to the
Court, wearing only their nethermoſt Garments,
and leaving their Weapons without the Gate, in
token of repentance: there with weeping, and all
tokens of humility, they made requeſt to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Kings preſence, <hi>beſeeching that he would
vouchſafe to pardon their Offence, and to pacifie
his wrath with the death of ſo many of them as he
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:46658:244"/>
ſhould think good, rather than to ſuffer them to
live in ſuch a reproach; which except he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe,
they proteſted they would never depart out of
the place.</hi> When theſe things were declared unto
<hi>Alexander,</hi> he cauſed the Court-gates to be opened,
and came forth amongſt them; where beholding
their lamentation and repentance, and the poſture
of their miſerable affliction, he could not abſtain to
weep a long time with them, and in conſideration of
their modeſty, forgave them their former offences;
and after he had moderately told them their faults,
and again comforted them with gentle words, he
diſcharged many from the Service of the Wars, and
ſent them home magnificently rewarded, writing to
<hi>Antipater</hi> his Lieutenant in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> that he ſhould
aſſigne them the chief places in the Theatres at Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
and publick Shews, where they ſhould ſit
with Garlands on their heads, willing, that their
Children after their deaths ſhould enjoy their Fathers
Pay. He appointed <hi>Craterus</hi> to be their Ruler, to
whom alſo in the place of <hi>Antipater</hi> he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Government of <hi>Macedonia, Theſſalia,</hi> and
<hi>Thracia, Antipater</hi> being ſent for to repair unto
him with a ſupply of young Souldiers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> had received Letters before, both from
him and <hi>Olympias</hi> his Mother, by which there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to be ſome diſcontents between them: For
his Mother accuſed <hi>Antipater</hi> that he went about to
make himſelf King; and <hi>Antipater</hi> did write how
<hi>Olympias</hi> did many things otherwiſe than did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
her. <hi>Antipater</hi> did take his calling away ſo
grievouſly to heart, that he conſpired thereupon to
poyſon <hi>Alexander,</hi> who having accompliſhed what
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:46658:244"/>
he reſolved to have done, advanced to <hi>Ecbatana</hi> in
<hi>Media,</hi> to ſet in order the neceſſary Affairs of his
Empire, and there ordained ſolemn Triumphs and
Feaſtings.</p>
            <p>It chanced that <hi>Epheſtion,</hi> whom the King entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
loved, and uſed in the place of a Brother, did
die at the ſame time of a Fever; whoſe death <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
took more heavily than may well be credited,
committing in his grief many things that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming
the Majeſty of a Prince: He commanded
<hi>Epheſtions</hi> Phyſician to be hanged, as though he had
died through his negligence. He lay imbracing of
the dead body, and could hardly be taken away by
his Friends, but continued his ſorrow night and
day.</p>
            <p>There are many other things written on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
which are ſcarcely credible; but it is certain,
that he commanded Sacrifice to be made unto him,
as to a god, and conſumed in his Burial, and in
making of his Tomb, above twelve thouſand Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents.
As he was returning to <hi>Babylon,</hi> the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean</hi>
Prophets met him on the way, exhorting him
not to enter into the City; for it was ſignified, That
if he went thither at that time, he ſhould be in great
peril of his life. Notwithſtanding, he regarded
not their Admonitions, but went forward in his
Journey, according as he was appointed; for he
underſtood that Embaſſadours were come thither
from all Regions, and tarried for his coming: the
terrour of his name was ſo ſpread through the world,
that all Nations ſhewed an obſequiouſneſs towards
him, as though he had been appointed to be their
King: This cauſed him to make haſte to <hi>Babylon,</hi> to
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:46658:245"/>
keep there as it were a Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the whole
World. When he was come thither, he received
the Embaſſadours gently, and afterwards diſmiſſed
them home again.</p>
            <p>There was about the ſame time a Banquet prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
at the houſe of one <hi>Theſſalus Medius,</hi> whereunto
the King (being invited) came with ſuch as were
appointed to keep him company: But he had no
ſooner drunk of <hi>Hercules</hi> Cup, but that he gave a
deep groan, as though he had been ſtruck to the
heart; and being carried out of the Feaſt half dead,
he was ſo tormented with pain, that he required a
Sword to have killed himſelf. His Friends did
publiſh abroad, that drunkenneſs was the cauſe of
his diſeaſe; but in very deed it was prepared Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
the infamy whereof, the Power of his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
did oppreſs. The poyſon prepared long before,
was delivered by <hi>Antipater</hi> unto his Son <hi>Caſſander,</hi>
who, with his brethren <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Iolla,</hi> were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
to ſerve the King at meat: he was warned
that he ſhould not commit the ſaid Poyſon to any
Perſon, except it were to <hi>Theſſalus,</hi> or to his own
brothers <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Iolla,</hi> who were both accuſtomed
to take the aſſay of the Kings Cup; and having the
poyſon ready in cold water, mixed it with Wine,
after they had taſted it. When the fourth day was
come, the Souldiers, partly becauſe they ſuſpected
he was dead, and partly becauſe they could not
endure to want long his ſight, came ſorrowfully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Court, deſiring to ſee the King; who by his
commandment were admitted unto his preſence, by
ſuch as had the charge of his perſon.</p>
            <p>When they beheld him lying in that eſtate, they
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:46658:245"/>
made great ſorrow and lamentation, for he ſeemed
not to them to be the ſame whom they were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
to behold, but rather a dead Corpſe. If their
grief were great, the ſorrow of them who ſtood next
to the Bed, appeared much greater; whom when
<hi>Alexander</hi> beheld to lament after that ſort, he ſaid
unto them:</p>
            <p>When I ſhall depart, you ſhall finde a King worthy
of ſuch men as you are.</p>
            <p>It is a thing incredible to ſpeak, how that during
the Souldiers of his whole Army came to viſit him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
he never altered his countenance nor geſture, but
continued in that preſence, which he gave unto the
firſt, unto the laſt man. When he had diſmiſſed the
multitude, as though he had been diſcharged of all
debt of life, he lay down to reſt his weak body; and
his voice beginning to fail him, he commanded his
Friends to draw near unto him: then taking his Ring
from his Finger, he delivered it to <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> and gave
therewith a commandment that his Body ſhould be
conveyed to <hi>Hammon.</hi> They demanded to whom he
would leave his Kingdom? he ſaid, <hi>To the worthieſt.</hi>
By which words it appeared, that he foreſaw the
Contention that was like to enſue upon his death.
<hi>Perdiccas</hi> moreover demanded of him, when he
would have divine Honours done unto him. <hi>At
ſuch time,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>as you ſhall finde your ſelves in Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe were the laſt words <hi>Alexander</hi> ſpake, and
ſhortly after he died. Immediately after his death,
the Court was full of howling and lamenting; and
by and by, as it had been in a deſart place, all things
were huſh, and a ſorrowful ſilence was ſpread over
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:46658:246"/>
all grief being converted into imagination, what
the event ſhould be. The young men of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
that were accuſtomed about the Kings perſon,
could not bear the greatneſs of their dolour, nor
keep themſelves within the compaſs of the Court,
but ran <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> as men out of their wits, whereby their

               </gap> filled with ſighs and tears, and no kinde of

               </gap>ation pretermitted, that ſorrow is accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> adminiſter in ſuch a caſe: Such therefore as
were without the Court, as well <hi>Macedons</hi> as others,
c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me running thither, where the Conquerours from
the conquered could not be diſcerned, ſo equal and
mutual was their ſorrow.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Perſians</hi> called upon their juſt and merciful
Lord, and the <hi>Macedons</hi> made invocation unto him
that was ſo juſt and gracious a King; and thus there
was a certain contention among them. They did not
only uſe the words of grief and heavineſs, but alſo
of murmuring and indignation, that ſo young a
Prince, being in the flower of his age, and ſo fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in ſucceſs, ſhould by the envy of the gods be ſo
taken out of this world. They called to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
what a chearfulneſs they had always ſeen in
his countenance, both when he led them to the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
or when he beſieged or aſſaulted any City, or
when he would give any commendation to the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
in any Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Macedons</hi> repented that ever they had
denied him divine honour, confeſſing themſelves both
wicked and ungrateful in depriving him of any name
whereof he was worthy. And when they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
long in the veneration and deſire of him that
was dead, they began to lament their own condition,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:46658:246"/>
who coming out of <hi>Macedon,</hi> were beyond the River
<hi>Euphrates,</hi> amongſt the middeſt of their Enemies,
who unwillingly received their new Government.
They ſaw themſelves left deſtitute, and the Empire
without any certain Heir; for want of whom every
one would go about to draw the Power of the State
into his own private intereſt. Then they began to
conceive and foreſee the Civil Wars that did enſue,
and that they ſhould be inforced to ſhed their bloud
again, not for the Conqueſt of <hi>Aſia,</hi> but for the Title
of ſome ſuch a one as would go about to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
King. Moreover, that ſuch who by reaſon of
their age had been diſcharged from the Wars by
their noble and righteous King, ſhould now be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to ſpend their lives in the quarrel of one who
was but his Souldier.</p>
            <p>Whiles they were in theſe imaginations, the night
came on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and increaſed their terrour: The men of
War watched in their Arms, and the <hi>Babylonians</hi>
looked over the Walls, peeping out from the tops
of their houſes, to diſcover ſome certainty how the
Affairs paſſed. There was not one that durſt kindle
any light; and becauſe the uſe of the eye did fail,
they laid their ears to hear the rumour and words
that were ſpoken; and many times they were afraid,
when no cauſe of fear was; and when they met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the narrow ſtreets, or dark lanes, they
would be amazed, and ſuſpect each other as enemies.
The <hi>Perſians</hi> after their accuſtomed manner, cut
ſhort their hair, and with their Wives and Children
lamented the death of <hi>Alexander</hi> in mourning Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with unfeigned affection, not as a Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
or one that lately had been their Enemy, but as
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:46658:247"/>
their right and natural King; for they being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to live under a King, could think no man
more worthy then himſelf to rule over them.</p>
            <p>This ſorrow was not contained within the walls
of the City, but ſtraightways it ſpread over all the
Country thereabouts. And the Fame of ſo great a
miſchief flying throughout <hi>Aſia,</hi> brought early ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
thereof unto <hi>Darius</hi> Mother: She at the firſt
report did tear aſunder the garment ſhe did wear,
and putting on mourning apparel, ſhe pulled her
hair, and fell down groveling upon the earth. One
of her Neeces ſate by her mourning for the death of
<hi>Epheſtion,</hi> who not long before had married her, and
in an univerſal heavineſs bewailed the cauſe of her
private ſorrow: but <hi>Siſigambis</hi> alone ſuſtained all
their miſeries, and bewailed both her own condition,
and her Neeces, her freſh ſorrow cauſing her to call
to minde things paſt. A man would have judged by
her behaviour, that <hi>Darius</hi> had been newly ſlain, or
that ſhe had now celebrated the Funerals of two
Sons together: She did not only lament the dead,
but ſorrowed alſo for the living.</p>
            <p>Who ſhall now <hi>(ſaid ſhe)</hi> take care of theſe young
Women? Or who can be like unto <hi>Alexander?</hi> Now
we are taken Priſoners again: We are newly fallen
again from our Dignity and Eſtate. After <hi>Darius</hi>
death we found one to defend us: but now ſince <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
is gone, who will have reſpect unto us?</p>
            <p>Among theſe things, ſhe called to minde how <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
the cruel King had ſlain her Father, and four-ſcore
of her Brethren in one day; and that of ſix
Children born of her Body, there was but one of
them left alive. She ſaw that Fortune had advanced
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:46658:247"/>
               <hi>Darius,</hi> and cauſed him to flouriſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> to the
intent ſhe might end his life by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
ſhe was ſo overcome with ſorrow, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
covered her head, turning her ſelf from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
and Nephew that ſate at her feet; and abſtaining
both from meat, and from beholding the light, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
ended her life the fifth day after ſhe was determined
to die. This her death was a great argument of the
clemency which <hi>Alexander</hi> had ſhew'd towards her,
and of his juſtice towards all the Captives, ſeeing
that after <hi>Darius</hi> death ſhe could not endure to live;
but after <hi>Alexanders</hi> departure, ſhe was aſhamed to
continue any longer.</p>
            <p>Conſider <hi>Alexander</hi> juſtly, and we muſt impute all
his Vertues to his own nature, and his Vices either
to his youth, or to the greatneſs of his Fortune: there
was in him an incredible force of Courage, and an
exceeding ſufferance of Travel: he was endued with
manhood, excelling not only Kings, but alſo ſuch
as had no other vertue or quality: he was of ſuch
liberality, that oftentimes he gave greater things
than the Receivers would have wiſhed for of God.
The multude of Kingdoms that he gave in Gift,
and reſtored to ſuch from whom he had taken them
by force, was a token of his Clemency towards
them whom he had ſubdued. He ſhewed a perpetual
contempt of Death; the fear whereof doth amaze o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men: And as there was in him a greater deſire
of Glory and worldly Praiſe than reaſon would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit;
ſo it was tolerable in ſo young a man, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
ſo great and wonderful Atchievements. The
reverence and affection he bare towards his Parents,
appeared in the purpoſe he had to conſecrate his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:46658:248"/>
               <hi>Olympias</hi> to immortality, and in that he ſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
revenged his Father <hi>Philips</hi> death. How gentle
was he towards his Friends? and how benevolent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Souldiers? He had a wiſdom equal to the
greatneſs of his heart, and ſuch a policy and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
as ſo young years were ſcarcely able to receive.
A meaſure he had in immoderate pleaſures, and luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
leſs than Nature deſired, uſing no pleaſure but
what was lawful: Theſe indeed were wonderful
great Gifts and Vertues; but in that he compared
himſelf to the gods, coveting divine honours, and
believing the Oracles that perſwaded ſuch things;
that he was offended with them that would not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
him, and given more vehemently to wrath than
was expedient; that he altered his habit and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
into the faſhion of ſtrangers, and counterfeited
the cuſtom of thoſe whom he had ſubdued and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
before his Victory, theſe were Vices to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to the greatneſs of his fortune: As the heat
of youth ſtirred him unto anger, and to the deſire
of Drinking, ſo age might have mitigated again
thoſe diſtempers. Notwithſtanding it muſt needs
be confeſſed, that though he prevailed much by his
Vertue, yet ought he to impute more unto his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
which only of all mortal men he had in his
own power. How often did ſhe deliver him from
the point of Death? How did ſhe protect him with
perpetual Felicity, when he had raſhly brought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
into peril? And when ſhe had decreed an end
to his glory, ſhe even then was content to finiſh his
life, ſtaying his fatal deſtiny until he had ſubdued the
Orient, viſited the Ocean, and fulfilled all that mans
mortality was able to perform.</p>

To this ſo great a King, and ſo noble a Conqueror,
a Succeſſor was wanting; and it was a task of too
great an importance for any one man to take it upon
him: his Name and Renown was ſo great amongſt
all Nations, that they were counted moſt noble, who
could be partakers (though it were never ſo little) of
his proſperous Fortune. But to return again to <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
from whence this digreſſion hath been made.</p>
            <p>They who had the Guard and Cuſtody of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
perſon, called into the Court ſuch as had been
his chief Friends, and Captains of the men of War,
after whom there follow'd a great multitude of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
deſiring to know who ſhould be Succeſſor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Alexander.</hi> The throng of the Souldiers was ſuch,
that many of the Captains were excluded, and could
not enter into the Court. A Proclamation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was made, whereby all men were forbidden to
enter, except ſuch as were called by name: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their commandment ſeemed to want autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
it was but little regarded, and the multitude at
firſt began to make a doleful cry and lamentation;
But immediately the deſire they had to underſtand
the event, ſtopped their lamentation, and procured
ſilence. Then <hi>Perdiccas</hi> brought forth in ſight of all
the people, the Kings Chair of Eſtate, wherein <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi>
Diadem, his Royal Habiliments, and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
was laid; amongſt which Ornaments <hi>Perdiccas</hi>
alſo laid down the Kings Signet, delivered to him
the day before; at the ſight whereof they began to
weep, and to renew again their ſorrow. Then ſaid
<hi>Perdiccas:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lo, here is the Ring wherewith he was accuſtomed to
Seal ſuch things as pertained to the Government of his
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:46658:249"/>
Empire, which as he delivered to me, I ſo reſtore it again
to you: And though no affliction can be deviſed by the
gods (were they never ſo much offended) comparable to
this; yet conſidering the greatneſs of the Acts which he
hath done, we muſt think that as the gods ſent ſuch a
man ſo to reign in the world, (his time being expired
that was appointed) they have called him back again to
the place from whence he came: Foraſmuch therefore
as nothing more of him remaineth capable of immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
let us perform the Rites pertaining to his Body, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
in what City we are, amongſt what kinde of
people, and what a King and Governour we have loſt. We
muſt conſider and conſult how to maintain our Conqueſt
amongſt thoſe men over whom it is gotten; for the doing
whereof, it is needful for us to have a Head; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the ſame ſhall be one or many, it doth conſiſt in you.
You are not ignorant that a multitude of men of War is
a Body without life. Six months are now paſſed, ſince
<hi>Roxaue</hi> was conceived with childe; we deſire of the gods
that ſhe may bring forth a Son, which may enjoy this
Kingdom when he cometh to Age: In the mean ſeaſon
appoint you by whom you will be governed.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Perdiccas</hi> had ſpoken theſe words, <hi>Nearchus</hi>
roſe up, and ſaid:</p>
            <p>There is no man can deny but that it were requiſite
that the Succeſſion ſhould continue in the Blood Royal;
but to look for a King that is not yet born, and to paſs
over one that is born already is not expedient for ſuch
men as the <hi>Macedons</hi> are, nor yet doth ſerve the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of the time. There is a Son whom <hi>Alexander</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
on <hi>Barſines,</hi> wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t ſhould hinder why the Diadem
may not be ſet upon his Head?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nearchus</hi> diſcourſe was acceptable to no man;
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:46658:249"/>
therefore the Souldiers, according to their cuſtom,
claſhed their Spears againſt their Targets, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
making a noiſe: And when he would not
forſake his opinion, but obſtinately maintained the
ſame, it had almoſt bred a ſedition; which being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> he ſpake after this manner:</p>
            <p>Neither the Son of <hi>Roxane,</hi> nor of <hi>Barſines,</hi> is an
Iſſue meet to reign over the <hi>Macedons,</hi> whoſe names we
ſhould be aſhamed to mention within <hi>Europe,</hi> their
mothers being Captives. Have we ſubdued the <hi>Perſians</hi>
to that end, to become ſubject to ſuch as are deſcended of
them? That was it which <hi>Darius</hi> and <hi>Xerxes,</hi> being
Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> did labour for in vain, with ſo many
millions of men of War, and with ſo many Navies. This
therefore is my opinion, that <hi>Alexanders</hi> Chair of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
be ſet in the middeſt of his Court, and that all
ſuch as were accuſtomed to be of Counſel with him, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
together, ſo often as any buſineſs requireth to be
conſulted on, and that the Captains and Rulers of the
Army be obedient to that Order whereunto the greateſt
number do aſſent.</p>
            <p>There were ſome agreed with <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> but few
with <hi>Perdiccas.</hi> Then <hi>Ariſtonus</hi> ſpake in this manner:</p>
            <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> was demanded to whom he would
leave his Kingdom, he willed the worthieſt to be choſen:
Whom judged he worthy but <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> to whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
his Ring? This was not done at ſuch a time as
he was alone, but when all his Friends were preſent he
did caſt his eyes amongſt them, and at length ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe out
one to whom he delivered it. For this cauſe I think it
right, that the Kingdome be committed to <hi>Perdiccas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many agreed to his opinion, ſo that the Aſſembly
cried out to <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> that he ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="472" facs="tcp:46658:250"/>
amongſt them, and take up the Kings Signet: But
he ſtayed between ambition and modeſty, thinking
the more modeſty he uſed in the obtaining the thing
he ſo much deſired, they would be ſo much the more
earneſt to proffer it to him. When he had ſtood a
good while at a ſtay, doubting what to do, at length
he drew back, and ſtood behinde them who ſate next
to him. When <hi>Meleager,</hi> who was one of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
ſaw the ſtay that <hi>Perdiccas</hi> made, he took cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
on his ſeeming unwillingneſs, and ſaid:</p>
            <p>Neither the gods will permit, nor men will ſuffer,
that <hi>Alexanders</hi> Fortune, and the weight of ſo great an
Empire ſhould reſt upon his ſhoulders: I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe
that there are many preſent more noble than he
is, and of greater worth, without whoſe conſent no ſuch
thing may be ſuffered to be done. There is no difference
whether you make <hi>Perdiccas</hi> King, or the ſon of <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane,</hi>
whenſoever he ſhall be born: <hi>Perdiccas</hi> goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to make himſelf King, under pretence to be Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to the Infant; this is the cauſe why no King can
pleaſe him, but ſuch as is not yet born. And in ſo great
a haſte as all we make to have a King, (which haſte is
both juſt and neceſſary for the preſervation of our eſtate,)
he only doth wait for the expiring of times and months,
imagining that ſhe ſhould bring forth a man-childe,
which I think you doubt not but he is already prepared
to counterfeit and exchange, if need be. If it were ſo in
very deed that <hi>Alexander</hi> had appointed him to be our
King, I am of opinion that the ſame thing only (of all
the things he had commanded) ought not to be obſerved
or performed. Why do not you run rather to ſeize upon
the Treaſure, ſeeing the people ought to inherit it?</p>
            <p>When he had ſpoken thoſe words, he brake tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:46658:250"/>
the preſs of armed men; and they who gave
way to him, followed him to the ſpoil, whereof he
made mention. The greedineſs of the Treaſure cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
a great Band of armed men to flock about <hi>Melea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi>
and the Aſſembly began to fall into ſedition,
which had grown to a greater inconvenience, if a
mean Souldier (whom very few did know) had not
ſtepped forth, and ſpoken to the multitude.</p>
            <p>What need we <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> grow into a Civil War ſeeing
we have a King already, whom you ſeek to finde? the
ſame is <hi>Arideus</hi> the Son of <hi>Philip,</hi> and brother to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
who lately was our King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> born and brought up
with him in the ſame Religion and Ceremonies that we
do uſe, who being the only Heir, I marvel by what
undeſert of his he is neglected? or what hath he done,
why he ſhould not enjoy his right deſcended unto him by
the univerſal law of the world? If you ſeek one to be
compared to <hi>Alexander,</hi> you ſhall never finde him: If
you will have ſuch a one as ſhall be next unto <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
this is only he.</p>
            <p>When theſe words were heard amongſt the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
they kept ſilence at the firſt, as if they had been
commanded by Authority; but afterwards they cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with one voice, that <hi>Arideus</hi> ſhould be called, and
that they were worthy of death who made the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
without him. Then <hi>Pythan</hi> being b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>wed
with tears, began to ſpeak.</p>
            <p>Now I perceive <hi>(ſaid he) Alexanders</hi> caſe to be moſt
miſerable, ſeeing he is defrauded of the fruit, which
ſuch as were his Souldiers and Subjects ſhould bring
forth at ſuch a time as this is: For looking only on the
Name and Memory of your King, you are utterly blinde
in other things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="474" facs="tcp:46658:251"/>
His words tended directly to the reproof of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deus,</hi>
that was his elected King; but his Speech pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
more hatred to the Speaker, than contempt to
the young man againſt whom it was intended: For
the compaſſion they had of <hi>Arideus,</hi> cauſed them the
more to favour his Cauſe; and therefore they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with a general Acclamation, <hi>That they would
not ſuffer any to reign over them, but him only who
was born to ſo great a hope; and ſtill they call'd for</hi>
Arideus <hi>to come forth amongſt them.</hi> Whereupon
<hi>Meleager</hi> (for the malice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

took an occaſion boldly to bring him into

and called him <hi>Philip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the voice of the people; but the Nobility
were of another minde, amongſt whom, <hi>Python</hi> took
upon him to put <hi>Perdiccas</hi> Plot in execution, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<hi>Perdiccas</hi> and <hi>Leonatus</hi> (deſcended both of

ſhould de born of <hi>Roxane:</hi> Adding moreover, that
<hi>Craterus</hi> and <hi>Antipater</hi> ſhould have the Rule within
<hi>Europe;</hi> and upon this, they ſware the Souldiers to be
obedient to <hi>Alexanders</hi> Iſſue. <hi>Meleager</hi> then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
not without cauſe, that ſome evil might come

There is no profound Sea ſo ſtormy nor tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous,
or that raiſeth up ſo many ſurges and waves,
as a Multitude doth motions and alterations, when
they ſwell with the hopes of a new Liberty, not
likely long to continue. There wanted not ſome
who gave their conſent to <hi>Perdiccas;</hi> but more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
to make <hi>Philip</hi> King: They could neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
nor diſagree a long time together; one while
repenting them of their Counſel, and immediately
again repenting them of the repentance. Yet finally,
they were inclined to prefer the Kings Bloud.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arideus</hi> was put in ſuch fear with the Authority of
the Nobility, that he departed out of the Aſſembly;
after whoſe departure, the favour of the Souldiers
was rather ſilenced than diminiſhed towards him:
ſo that at length he was called again, and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Royal Habiliments which lay in the Chair
were put upon him, and <hi>Meleager</hi> put on his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlet,
following as a defence to the Perſon of the new
King. The <hi>Phalanx</hi> claſhed their Spears to their
Targets, threatning to ſhed his bloud, who went
about to take the Kingdom that pertained not unto
him. They rejoyced that the ſtrength of the Empire
ſhould not be divided, but ſtill continue in the ſame
Bloud and Family; the right of whoſe Title by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
coming of the ſame Bloud-Royal, they
ſhewed themſelves ready to defend. For by reaſon
they were accuſtomed to have the Name of their
King in ſuch honour and veneration, they thought
no man worthy of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſuch a one who by deſcent
was born to reign. <hi>Perdiccas</hi> therefore was afraid,
and with ſix hundred men that were of an approved
manhood, took upon him to defend the place
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:46658:252"/>
where the body of <hi>Alexander</hi> lay. <hi>Ptolomy</hi> joyned
himſelf unto him alſo, and the Band of the young
Gentlemen that were about the Kings Perſon: but
ſo many thouſands of armed men as were on the
other ſide, did eaſily break in upon them; amongſt
whom <hi>Arideus</hi> was preſent, with a great Band for
the guard for his Perſon, whereof <hi>Meleager</hi> was chief.
<hi>Perdiccas</hi> therefore in great fury called ſuch to his
guard as would defend <hi>Alexanders</hi> Body; but many
of them were ſore hurt with Darts that came from
the contrary ſide.</p>
            <p>At laſt the ancient men plucked off their Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces
(the better to be known) and deſired them
who were with <hi>Perdiccas</hi> to abſtain from Civil War,
and give place to the King, and to the greater part.
Wherepon <hi>Perdiccas</hi> was the firſt that laid down
his Weapon, and the reſt did in like manner. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leager</hi>
then perſwaded them that they ſhould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
but remain ſtill about the dead Corpſe: But
<hi>Perdiccas</hi> judging it to be a deceit contrived to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap
him, drew back to the ſide of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the furtheſt part of the Court. Then the
Horſemen, which conſiſted chiefly of the Nobility,
flocked about <hi>Perdiccas</hi> and <hi>Leonatus,</hi> whoſe opinion
was to depart out of the City, and to take the Field;
but becauſe <hi>Perdiccas</hi> was not without hope that
the Footmen would have taken his part, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
remained ſtill within the City, leſt he might
ſeem to be the cauſe that the Horſemen ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
themſelves from the reſt of the Army. <hi>Meleager</hi>
ceaſed not to beat into the Kings head, That he
could not eſtabliſh himſelf ſurely in his Throne, but
by the death of <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> whoſe ambitious minde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="477" facs="tcp:46658:252"/>
and deſire of Innovation, was to be prevented in
time. He willed the King to remember what <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diccas</hi>
had deſerved at his hands, and that no man
could be faithful to him whom he feared. The King
rather ſuffering than aſſenting to his counſel, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leager</hi>
took his ſilence for a commandment, and
ſent for <hi>Perdiccas</hi> in the Kings name; they who
were ſent having Commiſſion to kill him, if he
ſhould make any delay to come with them. <hi>Perdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi>
hearing of their coming, accompanied only with
ſixteen young Gentlemen (accuſtomed to attend
upon <hi>Alexanders</hi> Perſon) met them as they would
have entred into his Lodging, and calling them
<hi>Meleagers</hi> Slaves, rebuked them with ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
both of minde and countenance, that they
returned back as men amazed. <hi>Perdiccas</hi> willed
ſuch as were in his company to keep on Horſeback,
and with a few of his Friends repaired unto <hi>Leona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
intending i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> any violence were moved againſt
him, to repulſe it with a greater force.</p>
            <p>The next day the <hi>Macedons</hi> murmured, and
thought it unjuſt that <hi>Perdiccas</hi> ſhould be brought
in danger of death; and therefore determined with
force to revenge the raſhneſs of <hi>Meleagers</hi> doings:
But he underſtanding of the Mutiny that was among
the Souldiers, gave place; and they repaired to the
King, demanding of him, <hi>If he had commanded</hi>
Perdiccas <hi>to be taken?</hi> He confeſſed the thing: <hi>but
it was done</hi> (he ſaid) <hi>by</hi> Meleagers <hi>inſtigation; for
which they ought not to raiſe any tumult, ſeeing that</hi>
Perdiccas <hi>was alive.</hi> The Aſſembly hereupon brake
up, and <hi>Meleager</hi> became ſo greatly afraid, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
by the departing of the Horſemen, that he
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:46658:253"/>
knew not what to do; for he ſaw the miſchief which
he a little before had intended againſt his Enemy, to
light upon himſelf: and while he debated with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
on this, and on that, three whole days were
conſumed. Howſoever, the accuſtomed form and
faſhion of the Court did remain in the mean ſeaſon;
for the Embaſſadors of divers Nations did addreſs
themſelves unto the King, the Captains of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
were preſent, and the Guard waited in Armour
as they were accuſtomed: But the great ſadneſs
that was there, without any apparent cauſe, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
ſome extreme deſpair. There was ſuch a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition
amongſt themſelves, that men durſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
one with another, but had ſecret imaginations
by themſelves; and by comparing the time preſent
with the time paſt, and the new King with the old,
they began to deſire the King that was gone. Then
one enquired of another, What was become of the
King, whoſe Fortune and Authority they had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed?
They found themſelves abandoned amongſt
ſo many unquiet and unconquered Nations, who
were deſirous upon any occaſion that might befal, to
be revenged of the injuries they had received.</p>
            <p>While they were troubled in theſe imaginations,
word was brought, that the Horſemen (who were
under <hi>Perdiccas)</hi> kept the Fields about <hi>Babylon,</hi> and
ſtayed all Victuals from coming to the City: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
firſt began a ſcarcity, and afterwards a famine;
therefore ſuch as were within the City thought good
either to make a reconciliation with <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> or
elſe to fight it out. It ſo chanced, that ſuch as dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
abroad in the Country, fearing the ſpoil of
the Villages, repaired into the City; and they
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:46658:253"/>
within the City, for want of Victuals departed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Country; ſo that every one thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſurer any where, then where their own Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations
were: Then the <hi>Macedons</hi> doubting ſome
great inconvenience that might proceed from this
fear, aſſembled together in the Court, and declared
their Opinions. It was agreed amongſt them, that
Embaſſadours ſhould be ſent to the Horſemen, for

were ſent from the King, who declaring their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
received anſwer, that the Horſemen
would not lay down their Arms, till the Authors of
that Sedition were delivered into their hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When
they were returned, and their anſwer known, the
Souldiers, without any appointment, put on their
Armour, and made ſuch a Tumult, that the King
was inforced to come forth of the Court, and ſaid
unto them:</p>
            <p>If we ſhall be at ſtrife among our ſelves, our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
that are at quiet ſhall enjoy the fruits of our

the hope of Reconcilement, you ſhall be the beginners
of a Civil War: Let us prove if they may be mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by another Embaſſie: I am of belief, that becauſe
the Body of <hi>Alexander</hi> remaineth yet unburied, they
will gladly come together to perform the Obſequies
unto the Dead. And for my part, I had rather ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
up again this Dignity, then that any bloud
ſhould be ſhed amongſt my Country-men; for if no

Tears then falling from his eyes, he took the
Diadem from his head, and holding the ſame forth
with his hand, he was ready to have delivered it to
any man who would profeſs himſelf to be more
worthy then he. The moderation that he uſed,
both in his words and behaviour, cauſed them all to
conceive a great good hope of his Noble Nature,
which till that time was obſcured by the height of
his Brothers Fame: They therefore incouraged and
importuned him to go forwards as he had deviſed:
whereupon he ſent again the ſame Embaſſadours that
went before, who had Commiſſion to deſire that
<hi>Meleager</hi> might be the third Ruler of the Men of
War. That demand was not much ſtuck at; for
<hi>Perdiccas</hi> was deſirous to remove <hi>Meleager</hi> from the
King, and conceived that the King being alone, the
King would not be able to match with <hi>Leonatus</hi> and
himſelf.</p>
            <p>Upon this <hi>Meleager</hi> marched out of the City with
the Footmen, and <hi>Perdiccas</hi> met him in the Fields,
riding before the Bands of the Horſemen: There
both Battels ſaluting one another, Concord and
Peace (as it was thought) was confirmed betwixt
them for ever: But it was decreed that Civil Wars
ſhould ariſe amongſt the <hi>Macedons;</hi> for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is impatient of Partners, and the Kingdom
was coveted by many: At firſt they gathered, and
afterwards diſperſed their Forces; for when the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
was burthened with more Heads then it could
bear, the other Members began to fail. So the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
of the <hi>Macedons,</hi> which under one Head might
well have ſtood, when it was divided into Parts, fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
to ruine. For this cauſe the people of <hi>Rome</hi> juſtly
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:46658:254"/>
muſt confeſs themſelves bound unto their Prince for
the felicity they injoy, who, as a Star in the night,
appeared unto them that were almoſt loſt: Surely it
was not the riſing of the Sun, but of him that gave
light unto the world in darkneſs; for without ſuch
a Head, the Members that were at variance muſt
needs have failed: How many Fire-brands did he
quench? How many drawn Swords did he cauſe to
be ſheathed? How great a Tempeſt did he pacifie
with the ſudden calm of his preſence? The Empire
now doth wax verdant and flouriſhing; let me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
without envy, that his houſe may continue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ages, and his Poſterity for evermore.</p>
            <p>But to return again to the order of the Hiſtory,
from whence I was brought through the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Univerſal Felicity; <hi>Perdiccas</hi> judged the
only hope of his own ſafeguard to conſiſt in the
death of <hi>Meleager,</hi> thinking it neceſſary to prevent
him, being a man both variable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unfaithful, given to
innovation, and beſides his mortal Enemy: But with
deep diſſimulation he kept his purpoſe ſecret, to the
intent, that with leſs difficulty he might oppreſs him
unawares: He therefore did ſubo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> privily certain
of the Troops under his own Command, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
openly (as though it were without his privity)
that <hi>Meleager</hi> ſhould be made equal with him in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
which words of the Souldiers when they
reported unto <hi>Meleager,</hi> he became in a great rage,
and declared them to <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> who ſeemed to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at it, and to be paſſionately ſorry for it; and
finally, they agreed amongſt themſelves, that the
Authors of ſuch ſeditious words ſhould be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="482" facs="tcp:46658:255"/>
When <hi>Meleager</hi> perceived <hi>Perdiccas</hi> ſo conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
he imbraced him, and gave him thanks for his
fidelity and benevolence: then in a conſultation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them both, they deviſed how to deſtroy ſuch as
wrought this diviſion betwixt them; for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of which to paſs, they agreed the Army ſhould
be purged according to their Country-cuſtom: To
the doing whereof they ſeemed to have a ſufficient
occaſion, by reaſon of the late diſcord amongſt them.
The Kings of <hi>Macedon,</hi> in the luſtration of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
were accuſtomed to uſe a kinde of Ceremony,
dividing the bowels of a Dog into two parts, and to
caſt the ſame in the uttermoſt bounds of the field on
which they intended to muſter their Army: the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
within thoſe bounds were all to ſtand armed;
the Horſemen, the Mercenary Souldiers, the <hi>Phalanx,</hi>
and every one apart. The ſame day that this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
was put in execution, the King ſtood in order
of Battel, with the Horſemen and the Elephants
againſt the Footmen, of whom <hi>Meleager</hi> had the Rule.</p>
            <p>When the Troops of Horſemen began to move,
the Footmen were ſuddenly poſſeſſed with a great
fear; and by reaſon of the late diſcord, conceived a
ſuſpition, that the Horſemen did intend no good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them: wherefore they ſtood a while in doubt,
whether they ſhould retire into the City or not, by
reaſon that the fields ſerved beſt for the Horſemen.
At laſt they ſtood ſtill, with a fix'd reſolution to
fight, if any ſhould offer them violence. When the
Battels were almoſt met, and only a ſmall diſtance
left, (whereby the one part was divided from the
other) the King, by the provocation of <hi>Perdiccas,</hi>
with a Band of Horſemen did ride along by the Foot,
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:46658:255"/>
requiring the delivery of ſuch to be executed as were
the Authors of the Diſcord, whom in very deed he
ought to have defended; and threatned, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
their delivery, to bring againſt them both the
Horſemen, and the Elephants. The Footmen were
amazed with the ſuddenneſs of the miſchief which
they looked not for, and there was no more coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
nor courage in <hi>Meleager,</hi> then in the reſt; but
they all judged it moſt expedient for them to abide
the adventure of that requeſt, and to expect rather
then to provoke Fortune.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Perdiccas</hi> ſaw them aſtonied, and in fear,
he ſevered out to the number of three hundred of
ſuch who followed <hi>Meleager</hi> when he brake out of
the Aſſembly that was firſt made after <hi>Alexanders</hi>
death, who in the ſight of the Army were caſt to the
Elephants, and there trampled to death with their
feet; of which <hi>Philip</hi> was neither the Author nor the
Forbidder, but thought to claim that for his own
act, which ſhould appear beſt in the end. This was
a ſignification, and a beginning unto the <hi>Macedons,</hi>
of the Civil Wars that inſued. <hi>Meleager</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
over-late the deceipt of this fine Plot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there was no violence offered unto his perſon,
ſtood at firſt quietly within the <hi>Phalanx,</hi> but ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after, when he ſaw his Enemies abuſing to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
the Name of him whom he had made
King, he deſpaired of his own ſafety, and fled into
a Temple: But the Religion of the place could not
ſo defend him, but that he was there ſlain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Perdiccas</hi> hereupon brought again the Army into
the City; and calling a Councel of all the principal
Perſonages, it was agreed ſo to divide the Empire,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:46658:256"/>
that the King ſhould remain as Chief of the whole;
<hi>Ptolomy</hi> was to be Lieutenant in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi>
and to have the Rule of the Nations there that were
under the <hi>Macedons</hi> Dominion: <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Phenicia</hi>
were appointed to <hi>Laomedon; Cilicia</hi> to <hi>Philotas;
Lycia,</hi> with <hi>Pamphylia,</hi> and the greater <hi>Phrygia,</hi>
were aſſigned to <hi>Antigonus; Caſſander</hi> was ſent into
<hi>Caria,</hi> and <hi>Menander</hi> into <hi>Lydia;</hi> the leſs <hi>Phrygia,</hi>
that joyneth unto <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> was <hi>Leonatus</hi> Province;
<hi>Eumenes</hi> had <hi>Cappadocia</hi> and <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> who was
commanded alſo to defend that Country ſo far as
<hi>Trapezunt,</hi> and make War with <hi>Arbates,</hi> who only
remained an Enemy to the Empire: <hi>Media</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<hi>Python,</hi> and <hi>Thracia</hi> to <hi>Lyſimachus,</hi> with
other Nations thereabouts, bordering upon the Sea
of <hi>Pontus.</hi> It was ordained alſo, that ſuch as ſhould
be the Governours over the <hi>Indians, Bactrians, Sog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
and the other Nations lying upon the Ocean
and Red Seas, ſhould, in matter of Juſtice, uſe Regal
Juriſdiction. It was decreed, that <hi>Perdiccas</hi> ſhould
remain with the King, and have the Governance
of the Men of War that followed him. Some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that theſe Provinces were thus diſtributed by
<hi>Alexanders</hi> Teſtament, but we have found the ſame
to be falſe, though ſome Authors do affirm it.</p>
            <p>The Empire being thus divided into parts, every
one might well have defended his proportion, if any
bounds could contain mens immoderate deſires; for
they who before were but ſervants to a King, did
not long after, under a ſpecious colour, invade one
anothers Kingdoms, being all of one Nation, and
having certain bounds to their Dominions allotted
to them: But it is hard for men to be contented with
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:46658:256"/>
that they have in poſſeſſion, when occaſion is prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
them of more; for the firſt things always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
of no value, when men are in hope of greater
things to come; ſo that every one of them thought
it an eaſier matter to increaſe his Kingdom, then it
was at the firſt to get it. <hi>Alexanders</hi> Body, in the
mean ſeaſon, lay ſeven days unburied; for whiles
every man had care for the eſtabliſhing of the State,
their mindes were drawn from the performing of
the Solemn Office to the Dead. There is no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
more fervent in heat then <hi>Meſopotamia;</hi> for the
Sun there burneth ſo hot, that it killeth the Beaſts
that are without covert, and burneth up all things
as it were with fire: And to the increaſe thereof,
there are but few Springs of water; and the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
uſe ſuch policy in hiding of thoſe they have,
that ſtrangers can have no uſe of them.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this, when <hi>Alexanders</hi> Friends
had the leiſure to take care of the dead Body, and
came to viſit the ſame, they found it without infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
corruption, or change of colour; the ſame chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of ſpirit which he had alive, being not yet
departed out of his countenance. Then the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and the <hi>Caldeans</hi> were commanded to im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>alm
his Body after their manner; who at the firſt (as
though he had been alive) ſhewed a fear to put their
hands to him; but afterwards making their prayers
that it might be lawful for mortal men to touch
him, they purged his body, and filled it with ſweet
Odours, and afterwards laid him upon a H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rſe of
Gold, and ſet a Diad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>m upon his head. It is record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that he died of Poyſon, and that <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>la, Antipaters</hi>
Son, being one of his Miniſters, had given him the
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:46658:257"/>
ſame. <hi>Alexander</hi> oftentimes would ſay, <hi>That</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pater
<hi>coveted the Eſtate of a King, affecting more
greatneſs then pertained to a Lieutenant; and that
through the glory of the Victory he had gotten of the</hi>
Lacedemonians, <hi>was become ſo proud, that he claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all things committed to him as his own.</hi> It is
thought alſo, that <hi>Craterus</hi> was ſent to kill him,
with thoſe old Souldiers that were diſmiſſed.</p>
            <p>It is certain that there is a Poyſon in <hi>Macedonia,</hi>
found in a water called <hi>Styges,</hi> of ſuch force, that it
conſumeth Iron, and will not be contained in any
thing except in the Hoof of a Horſe, or Mule;
which Poyſon was brought by <hi>Caſſander,</hi> and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to his Brother <hi>Iolla.,</hi> who preſented it in the
drink which the King laſt drank. However theſe
things are reported, the power of them of whom
the rumour was ſpread, ſhortly after oppreſſed the
infamy thereof: for <hi>Antipater</hi> became King both of
<hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> who afterwards took away
by death the Kings Off-ſpring, all being ſlain who
had any Alliance to him, although in the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
Conſanguinity. <hi>Ptolomy</hi> (who had the Rule
of <hi>Egypt)</hi> conveyed <hi>Alexanders</hi> Body to <hi>Memphis,</hi>
which within few years after was removed to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi>
where all Honour is given to his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and his Name.</p>
