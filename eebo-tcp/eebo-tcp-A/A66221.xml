            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THo' we know not all your Perſons, yet we have a Catalogue of your Names, and remember the Character of your Worth and Intereſt in your Country. You ſee we are come according to your Invitation and our Promiſe. Our Duty to God obliges us to Protect the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, and our Love to Mankind, your Liberties and Properties. We expected you that dwelt ſo near the place of our Landing, would have join'd us ſooner, not that it is now too late, nor that we want you Military Aſſiſtance ſo much as your Countenance, and Preſence, to Juſtifie our Declar'd Pretentions; rather than accompliſh our good and gracious Deſigns. Tho' we have brought both a good Fleet, and a good Army, to render theſe Kingdoms happy, by Reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Proteſtants from Popery, Slavery, and Arbitrary Power; by Reſtoring them to their Rights and Properties Eſtablished by Law, and by Promoting of Peace and Trade, which is the Soul of Government, and the very Life-Blood of a Nation; yet we rely more on the Goodneſs of God and the Juſtice of our Cauſe, than on any Humane Force and Power whatever. Yet ſince God is pleaſed we ſhall make uſe of Humane means, and not expect Miracles, for our preſervation and Happineſs: Let us not neglect making uſe of this Gracious Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, but with Prudence and Courage, put in Execution our ſo honourable purpoſes. Therefore Gentlemen, Friends and Fellow-Proteſtants, we bid you and all your Followers moſt heartily Wellcome to our Court and Camp. Let the whole World now Judge, if out pretentions are not Juſt, Generous, Sincere, and above Price; ſince we might have, even a Bridge of Gold, to Return back; But it is our Principle and Reſolution rather to dye in a Good Cauſe, than live in a Bad one, well knowing that Vertue and True Honour is its own Reward, and the Happineſs of Mankind our Great and Only Deſign.</p>
