            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The principall reason that mooued me thereunto, is in effect but that, which <hi>Tacitus</hi> saith euery historiographer should propose vnto himselfe, <hi>Ne virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessilea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tur, vt<expan>

For it is not to be denied, that the most part of the Chroniclers &amp; historiographers of our age, haue borne a hand hard ynough at least vpon the Prelates and Cleargy of former times, euery where like <hi>Chams,</hi> discouering the nakednes of these fathers, but seldome or neuer indeuouring with <hi>Sem</hi> to hide the same, much lesse affoording vnto them any honorable mention neuer so well deserued. This kinde of dealing though happily inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to good purposes, might not expect that successe and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb facs="tcp:3306:4"/>
at Gods hand, that the plame and sincere truth is wont to finde. As <hi>Marcellus</hi> Bishop of Ancyra (<hi>Socrates</hi> reports it) labouring a little too earnestly against one <hi>Asterius</hi> an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, and so derogating impiously from the person and dignity of our Sauiour Christ, byforcing some reasons of <hi>Paulus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosatenus</hi> (that swaruing as farre on the other side dispoyled the same our Sauiour of his humanity) he fell at last himselfe and drew many others into those pernicious &amp; impious errors of the <hi>Samosatenians:</hi> 
               <q>Stulti dum vitant vitia in contraria currunt)</q> Euen so, these men inioyning somewhat too furiously the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition and errors which the Cleargy of former times (much deale of ignorance) did teach and defend; whilest that the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to discredit their doctrine, they depraued their persons; it hath pleased God, that this vncharitable course should sort to some other effect then was intended, and that such, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his great mercy, was like to haue caused an inconuenience of little lesse importance (I will not say greater) then that which our late reformation hath redressed. For in the vulgar sort (which distinguish not so easily betweene persons and things) it bred a conceit, not onely that the men were wicked, and so their doctrine corrupt (although I know the conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to be weake) but also their functions and callings to be vtterly vnlawful &amp; Antichristian, which opinion once receiued in the minds of the multitude, gaue occasion of diuers plots, coloured with the plausible shew of reformation, but indeed principally ayming at the goods and reuenues of the church, the temporall rewards of learning; which being once taken away, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion is like to follow, we may easily see by the effects it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth foorth elsewhere. Those countries that heretofore haue yeelded great plenty of able-worke-folkes for the Lords vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; now that brood is spent which attayned learning, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards yet standing whole; they hardly can shew a man able to set pen to paper in defense of the truth. Yea euen amongst vs,
<pb facs="tcp:3306:4"/>
although the godly and excellent care of her Maiestie hath preseraed the state of this our church in such sort, as I thinke no other reformed Church of Christendome any thing neere comparable vnto it; yet the example of other, the knowen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of so many sacrilegious cormora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts as await daily the destruction of the same, and the doubt least it will decay, for that we cannot hope for the like piety in all succeeding Princes; it so far foorth discourageth men from the study of diuinity, as the best wits dayly refuse the Vniuersities (or Diuinity at the least, which in some other countries is accounted the surest way to aduauncement) and rather betake themselues to any other kind of life. Hereof it commeth to passe, that euery age bringeth forth lesse plenty of learned men then other amongst vs: And it is much to befeared, least our posterity will too truely say,
<q>
                  <l>AEtas parentum peior Auis tulit</l>
                  <l>Nos rudiores, mox daturos</l>
                  <l>Progeniem ineruditiosam.</l>
               </q>
To make no mention of such other reasons as might induce me to the publishing of these noses, least I make my porch larger then some principall roomes of my intended building; I thinke it necessary now to admonish the Reader, that he expect not any ample discourse of the liues and actions of the Bishops of our owne time or neere vnto it. I hane purposly auoyded to set downe any thing of them, but what either I finde written by other, or elseremayneth to be secne in publike record. And this course I haue taken, because I iudge it neither seemely to praise, nor safe to reprehend (how iustly soeuer) those men, that either by themselues, their neere friends or posterity yet liuing, may seeme either to haue allured me to flatter, or feared me from disclosing that truth, which otherwise I would haue vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. Neither do I thinke it needefull to say much of them, who being either present in action, or fresh in memory, are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently knowen vnto vs. Whereas moreouer, I haue passed ouer in silence some two Sees; you shal vnder stand, that I haue

beene forced there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> for want of some necessary instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which, by reason of the far distance of my place of dwelling from them, I haue not had meanes to attayne, although I haue endeuoured the same. I would therefore earnestly pray all men that can, to yeeld me helpe for the supplying of whatsoeuer may seeme to be wanting, either in those Sees or any other. I shall take it very thankfully at their hands. In the meane time, this which now I am able to affoord vnto you, I wish it may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in good part; and God grant it may in some measure prooue a meanes of the aduauncement of his glory, and the good of his Church.</p>

               <p>IT is very certaine and witnessed by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="596"/> many histories without exception, that our Island of Britayne receiued the faith of Christ euen in the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie of the Church. <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Sophronius</hi> Patriarke of Jerusalem affirme that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe was héere, and preached the Gospell after his first imprisonment at Rome. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephorus</hi> and some other report that <hi>Simon Zelotes</hi> came hither, and was the first messenger of the glad tidings of the Gospell to our nation. But it is deliuered by one consent that Saint <hi>Philip</hi> the Apostle of the Frenchmen vnderstanding how this Island (from whence first sprong the superstitious religion of the <hi>Druydes)</hi> was seperated from Fraunce by a small cut of a fewe houres saile; thought good to send ouer hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther twelue preachers, the chiefe whereof was <hi>Ioseph</hi> of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathia that buried the bodie of our Sauiour Christ. These men arriuing héere, the yéere of our Lord 63. did their best in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour for the conuersion of our Britaines. It pleased not God they shoulde preuaile with the king, who in no wise would be woone from the superstition of the <hi>Druydes:</hi> But of the meaner sort of people many there were that hearkened vnto them: yea the king himselfe admiring their great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie, painfulnes and vertuous behauiour, was content to assigne them a place of habitation (where Glastonbury now standeth) which was at that time and long after an Island all compassed about with lakes and standing water. And another king gaue vnto euery of those twelue a hide of lande in the countrey néere adioyning, which are named to this day the twelue hides of Glastonbury. In this Island of Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonbury (then called Auallon) <hi>Ioseph</hi> and his fellowes found
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3306:6"/>
meanes to build a church, which after they were dead stoode desolate, the whole Island being forsaken and remaining without any inhabitant many yéeres, euen vntill the time of king <hi>Lucius,</hi> which was about the yéere of Christ 180. It hapned then, a lawe héeretofore made by <hi>Claudius Caesar</hi> (as <hi>Suetonius</hi> reporteth in his life) was now generally put in execution, by the Romaines (who ruled all this end of the world) commanding that the superstitious religion of the <hi>Druydes</hi> should euery where be abolished.</p>
               <p>The pulling vp of these wéedes gaue good occasion vnto the séede of the Gospell (sowed long before by the preachers afore mentioned) now to spring and bring foorth fruite; whereunto God gaue so good increase, as <hi>Lucius</hi> the king himselfe was content to put on the swéete yoke of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: which that it might be the better and the more fruitfully performed, he sent <hi>Eluan</hi> (a notable impe and disciple of that holy College at Auallon) and <hi>Medwyin</hi> a Dutch man (that were the instruments of his conuersion) vnto <hi>Eleutherius</hi> the bishop of Rome, requesting that he would send other preachers vnto his realme by whom he and his people might be further instructed in the way of truth. He satisfied his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund and sent vnto him two notable men, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> and <hi>Phaganus,</hi> by whose paines and industrie chiefly the whole realme was finally conuerted. They sought out the ancient church at Glastonbury, repaired the same, and dwelled there for the space of nine yéeres after. Now king <hi>Lucius</hi> being himselfe Baptised and many of his people, in all parts of his dominions, he caused the temples of his false gods to be dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to the seruice of the true God, in the place of their priests he appointed preachers of the Gospel, and for their Flamines Bishops to the number of 28. Of these 28. thrée were Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops; one at London whose prouince was the south part of England: Another at Caerlegion vpon Uske, his prouince was Wales: And a third at Yorke, vnto whose iurisdiction the Bishops of Scotland and North England were subiect. The Gospell hauing taken such déepe roote héere, flourished a while very prosperously: And albeit it were often lopped and pruned afterward, yea the very maine rootes mightily struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at by the violent indeuour of sundry tyrants that sought
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3306:6"/>
vtterly to destroy and abolish the same out of this land: yet had it euer many constant and open professors that neuer suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred the light thereof vtterly to be extinguished Amongst ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, the most terrible persecution that euer this church sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned was by the Saxons, who expelled not onely Christian religion, but the followers of the same into a corner of this Island. Howbeit, euen amongst these very barbarous Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there were diuers from time to time that professed Christ But our countrey being in a manner all growen ouer with Pagamsme (for there was no publike allowance of Christian religion any where but in Wales) it pleased God to giue this occasion of replanting the same héere againe. It chanced that blessed and holy father Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> one day to espie certaine beautifull children to be sold in the stréetes of Rome, and vnderstanding they were Pagans, asked of what countrey they were: It was answered they were An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles: well may they be so called quoth he, for they looke like Angels. Demaunding them of what prouince they were, it was said they were of Deira: God grant (saith he) they may be <hi>De ira dei eruti,</hi> deliuered from the wrath of God and made partaker of his mercies by Christ. Hée procéeded yet further, and asked how the king of that countrey was called: vnderstanding his name was <hi>Elle. Alleluia</hi> (quoth he) must néedes be sung in those parts in praise of almightie God. Not long after then, this good man being made Pope, hée tooke especiall care of sending preachers into this land for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion of the same. Yet it is not to be denied, and it appée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth manifestly by the letters of Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> himselfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the king and Quéene of France, that this care of his was much stirred vp by the forwardnes of some good Saxons, that complained vnto him of the negligence of the French priestes, who being so néere, would neuer take any course for the planting of Christianitie amongst them, and therefore praied him that he would send preachers thither. He did so, &amp; made choice of one <hi>Augustine</hi> a monke of greater vertue then learning, vnto whom he appointed fortie other that shoulde accompanie and aide him in this holy worke. Being now well onward on their way, they enquired of the state of the countrey and manners of the people vnto whom they went,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3306:7"/>
and vnderstoode so much of their barbarous and fierce rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as they in a manner all vtterly renounced procéeding any farther in the voyage, and as it were compelled <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> to poste backe to Rome, there to craue licence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.

                  </gap>, writ his letters vnto them, wherein hé vsed many reasons to perswade them in any wise to goe forward; whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to at last they yéelded. They arriued at the Iste of Thanet in Kent the yéere 596. nowe iust a thousand yéeres agoe. The king of that countrie (his name was <hi>Ethelbert</hi>) inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them with all curtesie, the rather (as it is to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed) by the persuasion of his wife Berta that was a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. There was néere vnto the citie of Canterburie a church built of old by the Romaines and dedicated vnto S. <hi>Martin,</hi> in which the Quéene was woont to pray with <hi>Lethardus</hi> her Bishop. There these men were allowed to preach, pray, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise and vse all maner of exercise pertaining to Christian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. The king himselfe all this while gaue them mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, came often to heare them, and at last being throughly conuerted, tooke on him the badge of Christ by baptisme, all his people quickly following his example. He then also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed vnto <hi>Augustine</hi> and his companions a house at Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blegate, and allotted competent reuenues vnto the same. The matter being thus far forward, <hi>Augustine</hi> stept into France and caused himselfe there to be consecrated Archbishop of England by <hi>Etherius</hi> Archbishop of Arles. Presently vpon his returne thence, he sent two of his companie vnto Rome (<hi>Laurence</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi>) to aduertise the Pope of their good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse. By them when they returned he sent <hi>Augustine</hi> a pall, bookes, church-ornaments and other necessaries. He sent also presently vnto the king, and writ diuers letters; some gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latorie to the king, some vnto <hi>Augustine</hi> exhorting him to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in his calling, and to take héede least the miracles which God wrought by him for the conuersion of this people should make him proud; and lastly, others vnto the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Arles to thanke him for his good aide and assistance yéelded to these men in this businesse. In the meane time <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> had obtained of the king another church in the midst of the citie, built likewise heretofore by the Romaines and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3306:7"/>
dedicated the same vnto our Sauiour Christ. Soone after, this good king gaue vnto him also his owne palace and chiefe seate of his kingdome, remoouing himselfe vnto Rheaculf, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Romaines Regulbium now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Much paines he tooke to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade them, yea wrought a myracle by healing a blinde man for confirmation of his doctrine, as you may read in <hi>Beda</hi> his Eccl. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But they woulde by no meanes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to any such vnion, much lesse yéeld any kinde of subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that authoritie which he claimed to haue ouer all this Island. He gaue not ouer with one repulse, but when at the first he could not preuaile, he procured a second conference, at what time there met him seuen Britaine Bishops and a great number of monks, especially of that famous monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Bannachor a place not farre from Chester wherein there liued by the labour of their owne hands 2000. monks. These men before they came to the place of meeting appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, thought good to aske the counsell of a certaine Anehorite whom they reputed for a very holie and deuout man, and to know of him whether he thought it best for them to yeeld to the directions of Saint <hi>Augustine.</hi> He aduised them, if hee were a man of God, to take the course he shewed, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the same And when they asked how they should discerne whether he were such a one or no, he pronounced this say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Sauiour, <hi>Take my yoke vpon you and learne of me for I am meeke and humble of hart:</hi> If therefore this same <hi>Augustine</hi> be a méeke and humble minded man, it is a great presumption that he beareth the yoke of Christ, and offereth the same vnto you: But if he be stout and proud, he is not of God you may be bold. This therefore saith he is my aduire, haue a care that he and his companie be first in the place where you meete: If then you being the greater number he rise not to doe you reuerence, but despise you, despise you
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3306:8"/>
also him and his counsell. <hi>Augustine</hi> therefore first entered the place with his banner and his crosse, with singing proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and great pompe; and when the Britayne Bishops came in, neuer rose or saluted them at all. This they taking verie ill, gainsaid him in euery thing, told him, that as his opinions were allowed by <hi>Gregory,</hi> so had theirs long since by <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leutherius</hi> both Bishops of Rome, that they had an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop then commorant at Caerlegion, him they would obey and none other, especially such a one as he was, a man vnknowne, and a stranger not onely for his person and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, but much more for his opinions and strange conceits. <hi>Augustine</hi> much displeased with this short answere, prayed them to yéeld vnto him but in thrée things, to minister Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme and obserue Easter according to the Roman maner, to assist him in preaching Christ vnto the Saxons. But when they vtterly denied to ioyne with them in any sort, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced against them the iudgements of God for this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

It came to passe according to his prediction, that <hi>Edel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fride</hi> king of Northumbers; a Pagan Saxon came against them shortly after with a huge armie, ouerthrew them in battaile, and slew (besides an infinite number of souldiers and men of armes) a great many monkes, to the number of 1200. that were gathered togither there to fight by praier: onely fiftie persons saued themselues by flight. Soone after this battaile (which some say <hi>Augustine</hi> liued not to sée) he died, hauing béene Archbishop 16. yéeres, to wit, May 25.

Soone after his baptisme, by the counsel of his Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster he entred into orders and became a Deacon; in which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice he continued preaching very painfully, vntill at last he was made priest. Some report that he serued in the wars, some while vnder king <hi>Edward</hi> before he became a cleargie man; and it is not vnlikely. For after he was Bishop he was thrise in the field, &amp; did his prince notable seruice. He was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Bishopricke of Wiltshire (the Sée whereof was then seated at ramsbury) by the special fauour of king <hi>Athel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi> the yéere 920. King <hi>Athelston</hi> being dead, <hi>Edmund</hi> his brother that succéeded fauouring him no lesse then his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had done, vpon the death of <hi>Wlfhelm,</hi> procured him to be chosen Archbishop. A great while <hi>Odo</hi> refused (because he was no monke) to take that charge vpon him, saying, that neuer any man had held that place hetherto but he was a monke. Therein he was deceiued; For <hi>Nothelmus</hi> and two or thrée other before him were secular priests, &amp; not monks.) But he resolute in this errour, and loath to breake the dance, was perswaded first to become a monke of Floriake in France; and that done, accepted of the election. He continued Archbishop 24. yéeres, in great fauour and authoritie vnder diuers princes, <hi>Edmund, Edward, Athelstan,</hi> and <hi>Eadred.</hi> Towards the latter end of his time, <hi>Edwyn</hi> a yoong Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man obtained the crowne, with whom he had very ill agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He caused him to be diuorced from his Quéene, some say for consanguinity, some alleage other reasons. He excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated his concubines, and causing one of them whom the king doted vnreasonably vpon, to be fetcht out of the court by violence, burnt her in the forehead with a hot yron, &amp; banished her into Ireland. These things exasperated the king much against him: But he was taken away by death soone after, and so deliuered from al feare of the kings displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3306:15"/>
He was buried on the south side of the high alter, in a tombe built somewhat after the forme of a Pyramis. I take it to be the tombe of ieate standing in the grate néere the steps that lead vp to S. <hi>Thomas</hi> chappell. After his death (which hapned the yéere 958.) <hi>Elsinus</hi> Bishop of Winchester (that could neuer brooke <hi>Odo</hi> in his life time) by bribery &amp; corrupt meanes, obtained election vnto Canterbury, and comming thither, spurned at his tombe despitefully, vsing these spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, now at last (quoth he) thou art dead old dotard, and much against thy will hast left thy place vnto a man woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier of it then thy selfe. Our stories report, that the next night <hi>Odo</hi> appéered vnto him in his sléepe, threatning a spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and fearefull vengeance of this insolency. According vnto which prediction it fell out, that trauailing to Rome for his pall, vpon the Alpes he was so oppressed with cold, as he was constrained to put his féete wherewith he had so contumeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously disgraced his deceased predecessor, into the bellies of his horses, &amp; yet at last to die for cold. <hi>Brithelm</hi> Bishop of Wels was then chosen Archbishop, a vertuous and méeke man, but not very fit for gouernment: In regard whereof king <hi>Edgar</hi> intreated him and he easily condiscended to abide still at his old charge.</p>

               <p>VVIth the approbation of all men <hi>Dunstan</hi> Bishop <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="959"/> of London was then elected to this Metropoliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Sée. Of whom I know not how to write, that which is deliuered of him is so infinite. But I will hold my selfe within my determined bounds, and send the Reader that is desirous to heare more of him vnto other histories. He was borne in Somersetshire of good parentage: his fathers name was <hi>Herstan,</hi> &amp; his mothers <hi>Kinedeid.</hi> He was brought vp for the most part in the Abbey of Glastonbury, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side other good learning he was also taught to sing, play vpon iustruments, to paint and carue, in all which he prooued very excellent. From thence he went vnto <hi>Athelm</hi> Archbishop of Canterburie his vncle, who commended him vnto the king; And he partly in regard of the manifold good parts he sawe in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3306:15"/>
him, partly also for that he was néere of kinne vnto him, made very much of him. So he liued in the court a while, till for a certaine miracle (as the monks call it, which was then imputed to coniuration) with much disgrace he was driuen out of the court. After this he betooke himselfe vnto the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of <hi>Elphege</hi> Bishop of Winchester, another vncle of his, who perswaded him continually to become a monke. He could not heare of that side in any wise, till vpon a time fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling dangerously sicke, and thinking his disease a plague sent of God for his backwardnesse in that holy course whereto his vncle directed him, in great hast professed himselfe a monke. This done, &amp; hauing recouered his health, he went to his first nurse Glastonbury, leading there (in outward shew at least) an excéeding straite life. King <hi>Edward</hi> hearing great fame of his holinesse, sent for him vnto the court, where he liued in very diuers reputation, sometimes iudged too familar with faire women, sometimes accounted a coniurer, but for the most part admired as a most holy and vertuous man. Under two princes <hi>Edmund</hi> and <hi>Eldred</hi> (with whom he was most gracious) he ruled all things at his pleasure. <hi>Edwyn</hi> the sonne of king <hi>Edmund</hi> that succéeded <hi>Eldred,</hi> could in no wise brooke him. Some say it was because <hi>Dunstan</hi> was forward in reprehending the kings vices; as namely, that when the king rising from the feast of his coronation, went immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his chamber, where a certaine beautifull concubine at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his comming; <hi>Dunstan</hi> that had gotten some inkling of the businesse he went about, followed him boldly, and forced him not onely to leaue that enterprise for that time, but also to forsweare the companie of that woman. But the vndoubted ground of this dislike was this. <hi>Dunstan</hi> had so bewitched the former kings with the loue of monkery, as they not onely tooke violently from married priestes their liuings to erect monasteries, but also spent very lauishly of their owne treasures, which they should rather haue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied in resisting the common enimy both of God and their country the Dane. King <hi>Edwyn</hi> perceiuing all the wealth of the land to be crept into monasteries, not onely refrained to bestow more vpon them, but recalled diuers of those prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall gifts his predecessors had made, and when the monks
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3306:16"/>
refused to render them at his demaund, he became a very bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter persecutor of them, and their patrons. <hi>Dunstan</hi> therefore séeing nothing before him at home but danger and continuall disgrace, got him away into France, and there liued in ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment the space of a yéere. In the meane time king <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyn</hi> by the rebellion of his subiects (at the instigation it is likely of our monks and their fauourers) was depriued both of his life and kingdome. <hi>Edgar</hi> that succéeded, warned by his brothers example, was content to curry fauour with them, and to that purpose restored whatsoeuer was taken from them, and not onely called home <hi>Dunstan,</hi> but promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, first vnto the Bishoprick of Worcester, soone after of London, and lastly hauing béene but two yéeres at London, to the Archbishopricke of Canterbury. In that place he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued 27. yéeres, applying all his endeuours to the enriching of monks and monasteries inhabited by them, persecuting and hunting maried priests euery where out of their liuing.

The first signe of his hidden rancour and hatred towarde him was, that he would not suffer himselfe to be crowned by him, but made choise of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> Archbishop of Yorke: for which he alleaged other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as that he had not yet receiued his pall &amp;c. But the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was, he was loth in that action to acknowledge him for Archbishop. Soone after his coronation, he departed into Normandy carrying with him <hi>Stigand</hi> and many English nobles, vnder pretence to doe them honour: But in truth he stood in doubt least in his absence they should practise some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what against him: And namely <hi>Stigand</hi> he knew to be a man of a haughty spirit, subtile, rich, gracious and of great power in his countrey. Presently vpon his returne, certaine Cardinals arriued in England, sent from the Pope as le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates to redresse (as they said) certaine enormities and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the English clergy. <hi>Stigand</hi> by and by perceiuing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be the marke that was specially shot at, hid himfelfe a while in Scotland with <hi>Alexander</hi> Bishop of Lincolne and after in the Isle of Ely. At last perceiuing a conuocation to be called at Winchester, he came thither and besought the king in regarde of his owne honour, and the promise made vnto
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3306:19"/>
him at Swanscombe (which was not to be offended with him or any other for their attempt at that time) to saue him from the calamity he saw growing toward him, which he could not impute vnto any thing so probably, as his vndeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued displeasure. The king answered him with very gentle words, that he was so farre from endeuouring to take any reuenge of that or any other matter, as he loued him, and wished he knew how to protect him from the danger immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: But that which was to be done at that time, must be done by the Popes authoritie which he might not counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund. So do what he could, he was depriued of his liuings by these legates. The causes alleaged against him were these; First, that he had held Canterbury and Winchester both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether (which was no very strange thing, for Saint <hi>Oswald</hi> had long before held Worceter with Yorke, and S. <hi>Dunstan</hi> Worceter with London.) Secondly, that he had inuaded the Sée of Canterbury, <hi>Robert</hi> the Archbishop being yet aliue vndepriued; And lastly that he presumed to vse the pall of his predecessor <hi>Robert</hi> left at Canterbury, and had neuer recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued any pall but of Pope <hi>Benedict,</hi> at what time he stood ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate for simony and other like crimes. In the same conuocation many other Prelates were depriued of their promotions, as <hi>

All which was done by the procurement of the king, that was desirous to place his countrymen in the roomes of the depriued for the establishment of his new gotten kingdome. Poore <hi>Stigand</hi> being thus depriued, as though he had not yet harme inough, was also clapt vp presently in prison within the castell of Winchester, and very hardly vsed there, being scarcely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed meate inough to hold life and soule together. That was thought to be done to force him to confesse where his treasure lay, whereof being demaunded, he protested with great othes he had no mony at all; hoping belike so to procure his liberty the rather, and then to make himselfe mery with that he had laid vp against such a déere yéere. He died soone after of sorrow and griefe of minde, or (as other report) of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary famine, 17. yéeres after he first obtained the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke. After his death, a little key was found about his

This <hi>Lanfrank</hi> was borne at Papia in Lumbardy, twenty myles from Millayn, where being brought vp in learning, and now come vnto mans state, he determined to trauaile. Through France he came into Normandy, prouoked by the fame and great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports he had heard of <hi>Eluin</hi> abbot of Becco. Upon the way thitherward, it was his hap to be encountred with théeues that spoiled him of all he had, bound him and threw him into a thicket, where he might haue perished with cold and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger had not God sent some extraordinary company that way that loosed him, hauing laien there onely one night. Thence he got him vnto the monastery of Becco, and for very want and penury was faine to become a Reader of Logike there, vntill he was admitted to the place of a monke. Soone after that, he was made Prior of Becco, whence in regard of his singular wisedome and great knowledge in all good learning that those times could affoord) he was called by Duke <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> to be abbot of S.

Now <hi>Stigand</hi> being displaced in manner aboue rehearsed, the conquerour well knowing how much it behooued him to the establishment of his new erected throne in England, to haue a man wise and faithfull in that place; made a speciall choice of him, as one in all respects most fit and woorthy; which being well knowne to all men, the Couent at the kings first nomination readily chose him, the nobilitie and courtiers willingly assented, and receaued
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3306:20"/>
him with great applause, and lastly the Pope affoorded him his pall with extraordinary fauour. It is said, at his first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Pope rose vp vnto him and mette him, telling him he yeelded him that honour not of dutie, but in regard of his excellent learning, whereof he had heard great fame. <hi>Thomas</hi> Archbishop of Yorke was present the same time, together with <hi>

                  </hi> Bishop of Dorchester. This <hi>Thomas</hi> had béene lately consecrated vnto Yorke by <hi>Lanfrank,</hi> and for a certaine time refused to make profession of obedience vnto the See of Canterbury, euen vntill by the commandement of the king he was inforced thereunto. Now whether it were discontentment and perswasion of a wrong, or else enuie at <hi>Lanfranks</hi> either vertue or good fortune that mooued him, hée presently began to make complaint vnto the Pope of a great miury offered vnto his Sée, in the demaund of his profession. <hi>Lanfrank</hi> pleaded prescription for his right, and offred to make proofe of the same. The Pope therefore not willing to trouble himselfe any more with the matter, committed the hearing thereof vnto the king, who in the yéere 1072. iudged it for Canterbury. Sée more of this quarrell in <hi>Thomas</hi> of Yorke. <hi>Lanfrank</hi> himselfe was consecrated very solemnly at Canterbury, all the Bishops in England being present them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues or by their proctors August 29. 1070. Almost 18. yeres he continued Archbishop, gouerning his charge laudably and happily, till that about the end of his time one action obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his former praises, and furthermore was the cause of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great calamities vnto him. It is thought that <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror left the kingdome of England vnto his yoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger sonne <hi>William Rufus,</hi> at the perswasion especially of this Archbishop, who the rather wisht well vnto the yoong prince, because he had béene brought vp vnder him in his childhood. He is blamed much for putting the eldest sonne <hi>Robert</hi> from that which might séeme in some sort due vnto him; and sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God blessed him not in that action. The king thus aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by him, fel out with him, and droue him out of the realme. The cause of this displeasure is diuersly reported: But most men agree it was none other then this, that the king thought him a little too busie in exhorting him to vertue and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and reprehending his manifold vices.

He was buried at Canterbury in his owne church, vnto which he was a great benefactor. He bestowed much vpon the fabrike and repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the same, built much housing for the monkes (whose number he increased from 30. to 140.) restored the dignities and offices of old belonging to the monastery, and recouered vnto the same 25.

Hither he came and had much honour done him euery where of all forts of people. The king himselfe amongst the rest, beside many verball fauours, made offer vnto him of the Archbishopricke of Canterbury, verily hoping belike that a man giuen to monasticall contemplation and not estéeming worldly pompe, would vndoubtedly haue refused the same: For it is certaine, that after <hi>Anselm</hi> had accepted the offer, pitying belike the spoile and desolation of the church for want of a pastor; the king would faine haue retracted his gift, and perswaded him with many reasons to leaue it; shewing him how the burthen and trouble of the place was greater then he should be able to inoure, a man that had spent his time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the wals of a monastery, and not experienced in managing of great affaires.

After great stirre and much adoe betwéene them about this matter, it was determined that all the abbots and Bishops of England should be called together to iudge of this controuersy.

of chastity, as we may sée reported by <hi>Girard</hi> Archbishop of Yorke in an epistle written by him vnto <hi>Anselm</hi> in the end of S. <hi>Anselmes</hi> Epistles. The falling out also of <hi>Anselm</hi> with the king (which happened presently after) was a great weakning vnto these canons. All the time that the Archbishop was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent (which was three yéeres) the king had disposed of all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks that fell, at his pleasure, giuing inuestiture and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of them, by deliuery of the staffe and the ring. And in deed the princes in a maner of all christendom, had taken this kind of authority vnto themselues euery where about this time. Bishops thus appointed demanded consecration of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selm,</hi> which he vtterly denied vnto them, professing withall, that he would neuer receaue or repute them for Bishops that were already co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrated by other vpon such election, aleaging how it was lately forbidden in a councel held by Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> 2. that any clerke should take inuestiture of any spiritual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment at the hand of any king, prince or other lay man. The king vpon <hi>Anselms</hi> refusall, required <hi>Gerard</hi> Archbishop of Yorke to giue these Bishops consecration, whereunto he readily assented. But <hi>William Gifford</hi> nominated to Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester, stoode so in awe of <hi>Anselm,</hi> as that he durst not accept consecration at <hi>Gerards</hi> hands. This incensed the king woonderfully, so as presently he commanded <hi>Giffards</hi> goods to be confiscate, and himselfe banished the Realme. Great adoo now there was about this matter throughout the realm, some defending the kings right, others taking part with the Archbishop. In the end, the king doubting what might come of it, and being loth to giue occasion of tumult, considering that himselfe was a stranger borne, and that his father by force and much bloudshed, had not many yéeres since obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the rule of this land; he determined to send an Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to the Pope, togither with the Archbishop, so to grow to some reasonable conclusion. The Pope <hi>(Palchalis 2.)</hi> would not yéeld one iote vnto the king, insomuch as when the kings Embassador <hi>William Warelwast</hi> (after Bishop of Excester) said he knew the king would rather loose his crowne then this priuilege, he answered, yea let him loose his head also if he will, while I liue he shall neuer appoint Bishop but I will resist him what I may. So without dooing any good, home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3306:24"/>
they came. But the king vnderstanding before hand how the world went, sent a messenger to forbid <hi>Anselm</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the realme, and presently seised all his goods, mooueable and unmooueable into his hands. Thrée yéeres more this good man spent in exile, all which time he liued with <hi>Hugh</hi> Archbishop of Lyons. At last it pleased God to open this passage of his reconciliation to the king. <hi>Adela</hi> Countesse of Bloys the kings sister, fell dangerously sicke in those parts where it chanced the Archbishop to abide. He went to visite her, and yéelded so great comfort vnto her in that time of her distresse; as recouering afterward, she neuer ceased importuning her brother, vntill she had wrought an agréement betwéene them, the conditions whereof were these; First that <hi>Anselm</hi> should be content to consecrate the Bishops alreadie nominated by the king: And then that the king should renounce all right to such nomination or inues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titure for the time to come. These conditions were allowed by the Pope, and the Archbishop restored not onely to his place, but to all his goods and fruites gathered in the time of his absence. Two yeeres he liued after this his last returne; in which time he persecuted married priests very extremely. <hi>Dunstan, Oswald, Ethelwald,</hi> and other enimies to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of clergie men, had onely expelled them that out of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries that had wiues: But <hi>Anselm</hi> vtterly forbidding them mariage, depriued them of their promotions that were maried, confiscated their goods vnto the Bishop of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, adiudged them and their wiues adulterers, and forced al that entred into orders to vow chastity. Halfe the clergy of England at this time were either maried men, or the sonnes of maried priests. The king therefore pitying the generality of this calamity, sought to protect them a while from <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selms</hi> seuerity in this point: But he (I meane <hi>Anselm)</hi> was a little to resolute in all his determinations, in so much as he might neuer be perswaded to yéeld one iot in any thing he once intended. So, notwithstanding the kings inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to succour so many distressed poore families, the canons of the Conuocation before mentioned were generally put in execution throughout England. About this time it hapned <hi>Gerard</hi> Archbishop of Yorke to decease, and a second <hi>Thomas</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:3306:24"/>
to be elected for his successor. What adoo there was betwéene him and <hi>Anselm</hi> about profession of obedience, and how it was ended, see in the historie of the said <hi>Thomas.</hi> To make an end at last with this Archbishop, the yéere 1109. he fell ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely sicke at Saint Edmundsbury, and thence got him to Canterbury, where he lay languishing a long time, and at last departed this life Aprill 21. in the 16. yéere of his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of his age 76. He was buried at the head of his predecessor <hi>Lanfrank</hi> in his owne church, vpon the building and beautifying whereof, he had bestowed very much mony. This Archbishop was a man of great learning, as his works yet extant testifie, and for integrity of life and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation admirable. That he was more peremptory in diuers of his resolutions then became him, and so hote against Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy mens mariage, I impute it but to a blind zeale far from any malicious intent of dooing wrong. Undoubtedly not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding these imperfections he was a good and holy man, and as woorthy the honor of a Saint, as any I thinke that euer was Canonised by the Pope since his time. In fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of him (to note that by the way) the Pope affoorded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his sée this honour, that whereas the Archbishop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury was woont to sit next the Bishop of Saint Ruffine in all generall Councels, hereafter his place should be at the Popes right foote, and with all vsed these words, <hi>Includamus hunc in orbe nostro tanquam alterius orbis Papam.</hi>

In regard hereof, he imployed all his indeuours to plant a perfect liking of <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> in the mind of the King; wherein he prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:3306:27"/>
so well, as in a short time no man was so farre in the Kings bookes as he, nay no man could doo any thing in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with the King but he. For the maintaining of this his credit (saith one) he thought it good to relinquish and forsake by little and little all Priestly either behauior or attyre, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the pompe and brauery of the Court, to liue as other Courtyers, to fare daintily, to ly long in bed, to hawke, to hunt, to haue many followers, &amp;c. in so much as some sticked not to say, the Chauncellor had forgotten he was an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon also, and blamed him for not liuing like a Clergy man. But by this meanes (saith he) <hi>T. Becket</hi> was euer at the Kings elbow, was partaker of all his counsels, and either by notize giuen to the Archbishop, or some deuice of his owne otherwise, could and did stop any courses that might be preiudiciall to the Church. Hauing continued thus in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chauncellor foure or fiue yéeres with the great fauour and liking of the King; it hapened <hi>Theobald</hi> the Archbishop to dye: The king little thinking what a snake he nourished in his bosome, determined by &amp; by to doo his vtmost indeuor for the aduauncement of him <hi>(T. Becket)</hi> vnto the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppricke. Being therefore at that time in Normandy, he sent <hi>Richard Lucy</hi> a counsellor of speciall trust into England with charge to effect these two things; first to procure all the Nobles and best of the comminalty to sweare fealty vnto yoong Prince <hi>Henry</hi> his sonne; and then to cause the Monkes of Canterbury to elect <hi>Thomas</hi> his Chauncellor Archbishop. The first he quickly brought to passe (the rather by the helpe of the Chauncellor that was ioined in commission with him) And in the second also he bestirred him selfe so well, as he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the whole conuocation of the Clergy (a wost authenticall kind of election) to choose <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> for their Archbishop no one man gainesaying it except <hi>Gilbert Foliot</hi> Bishop of London. He was consecrate Archbishop vpon Whitsonday (being made Priest but iust the day before) by the Bishop of Wintchester. ann. 1162. being not yet full 44. yéeres of age. Presently after his consecration, he altered all the whole course of his life; became so graue, so austere and so deuout in all outward shewe, as he séemed quite another man. Also he resigned his Chauncellorship, certifiyng the King by letters
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:3306:28"/>
(who was then in Normandy) he could not serue the Church and the Court both at once. The King that euer hitherto thought to vse <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> as a schoole master to instruct and inure his sonne in matters of state and policy; was now very sory that he had made him Archbishop, séeing he threw off all care of temporall gouernment; and considering the hawtinesse of his spirits, sore doubted wherunto this strange dealing would growe at the last. Another thing the King greatly disliked in him was this; that being yet scarcely warme in his seate, he began to looke so narrowly into the state of the land belonging to his sée, and to challenge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all extremity whatsouer might séeme to pertaine vnto him, as he prouoked many of all sorts of people against him, who euery where exclaimed with open mouth and made their complaints thicke and thréefold vnto the King, saying that hauing some authority and more knowledge in the Lawe, vnder colour of defending the rights of his Church, he tooke violently from euery man what he list. But the maine quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell betwixt the King and him was this: The Cleargy of those times bare them selues so bold vpon the priuileges of the Church, whereby, in crymes neuer so haynous they clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be exempted from the iudgement of temporall courts; as, dayly infinite outrages were committed by Cleargy men, murthers, robberies, rapes, &amp;c. which temporall Judges might not meddle withall, and in the spirituall courtes they were either not punished, or for the most part very lightly. For the amendment and preuention of this inconuenience in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> to come, the King intended to publish a certaine decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the customes of England, set downe long since by King <hi>Henry</hi> the first his grandfather, wherein this intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and licencious liberty of the Cleargy was somewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained. And that it might not be spurned at by any (the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop especially he doubted:) he deuised to send this declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion vnto the Pope and to craue his allowance of the same. But the Archbishop hauing some inkling of the Kings intent before hand, had so dealt with the Pope, as it was no sooner séene but it was streight reiected. Herewith the King was so incensed, as after that time he bent himselfe altogether to the diminishing and breaking of all immunities and liberties of

the church. And the Archbishop was so farre from séeking to pacifie the Kings displeasure, as daily he prouoked him more and more. The particularities thereof to passe ouer, the King thought good to try whether he could put in execution the contents of the foresaid declaration euen in despite of the Archbishop or no.

Presently vpon his arriuall he was apprehended and carried prisoner to Northampton (where the king then held a Councell) and was there accused of extortion, periury, treason, forgery, and many other crimes. His owne suffragan Bishops, though he had appealed vnto the Pope, gaue sentence against him, and warranted the king they would make proofe of these ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations vnto the Pope. The next night after his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he scaped away and once more hasted vnto the sea, committed himselfe very desperately vnto a little bad rotten fisher boat, and accompanied onely with three seruitors cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedthe sea, and got into the low Countries, and thence posted to the Pope at Senon, who placed him in the monastery of Pontiniac. While he there rested himselfe, he thundred out excommunications apace against all such as did obserue

the articles contayned in the declaration set foorth at Clarin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, whereunto himselfe had once sworne. The King as fast bestird himselfe in seasing all the goods and temporalties of the Archbishop into his hand. He sent also ambassadors vnto the Earle of Flaunders, the French King and the Pope pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in no wise to foster or suffer him in their dominions, requesting moreouer of the Pope, that he would confirme and allow of the declaration published at Clarindon. The Pope made an answere (though friuolous) saying he would consider of the matter. But the French (with whom the King of England had amity and a league of friendship at that time) he thinking that this agreement betweene him and the Archbishop would bréed some stirre in England, presently fell to inuading the King of Englands dominions &amp; tooke by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault certaine holds of his in Normandy. The Archbishop also about the same time sent out particular excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against all the suffragan Bishops of his Prouince. The King mightily offended with this excéeding boldnesse of the Archbishop, whereunto he well knew he was hartned and animated by the Pope and the French King: bethough him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe how by all meanes possible he might vere and grieue him: First, because he knew he delighted much in the mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of Pontiniac (which was an Abbey of Cistercian monkes) he signified to all the monkes of that order in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, that he would banish them euery one, if they would not procure the Archbishop to be thrust out of that monastery, which for feare of so great calamity to so many men was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. Then he also droue out of the realme, all his kinsfolks, friends and professed welwillers of whom he suspected him to be any way aided or comforted. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Pope <hi>Thomas Beckets</hi> surest card, was ferited in much like sort the same time by <hi>Friderike <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The King therefore by the counsell of <hi>Gilbert</hi> Bishop of London determined to ioyns in league with the Emperor, (if possibly he might) that was a professed enimy both to the French King and the Pope. To this purpose he sent two am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors vnto him, perswading him to deals with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals (<hi>Lucius</hi> the Antipope being then lately dead) to set vp another in his roome, to whom he promised all his dominions

Now it had hapened a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Pope had graunted vnto the Archbishop a very large licence of excommunicating whom he list in England; the King the Queene and a very few other excepted.

By this time the French King (the Popes onely Protector against the Emperor) began to spy that he was much more cold in the defence of the Archbishop then he had beene and reprehended him sharply for it. The Pope therefore not knowing which way to turne him selfe; for the satisfiyng of both these potentates, (neither of which he could safcly offend as things stoode) he determined first to labour a reconciliation betweene them, and then to make the French King a media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor for the Archbishop.

of this fellow, that I can not hope for any good dealing at his hands. Sée you not how he goeth about to delude me with this clause (sauing the honor of God?) For whatsoeuer shall displease him, he will by and by alleage to be preiudiciall to the honor of Almighty God. But this I will say vnto you, whereas there haue béene Kings of England many before me, whereof some were peraduenture of greater power than I, the most part farre lesse; and againe many Archbishops before this man holy and notable men: Looke what duty was euer perfourmed by the greatest Archbishop that euer was to the weakest and simplest of my predecessours, let him yéeld me but that and it shall abundantly content me. Hereunto the Archbishop answered cunningly and stoutly ynough, that the times were altered, his predecessors which could not bring all things to passe at the first dash were content to beare with many things, and that as men they fell and omitted their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty oftentimes; that which the Church had gotten, was by the constancy of good Prelates, whose example he would follow thus farre foorth, as though he could not augment the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the Church in his time, yet he would neuer consent they should be diminished. This answeare being heard, all men cryed shame vpon him and generally imputed the fault of these sturs vnto him. But this was the issue for that time, that they parted without reconciliation. The King doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what might come of these broiles, caused his sonne Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (that died soone after) to be crowned King in his owne life time, so to assure him of the succession. Afterwards comming into Fraunce againe, they were vpon the point of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation when the casting out of some such word or another as before, marred all. At length, the King and he were made friends, but his full restitution deferred till he had behaued himselfe quietly a while at Canterbury, which he promised to doo. But he, was so farre from perfourming that promise, as he sent into England before him diuers excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the Pope had graunted out long before, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his discretion. Amongst other, the Archbishop of Yorke, the Bishop of London and Salisbury were named in them, together with so many as had béene dooers in the coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the yoong King, which the Archbishop said might
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3306:30"/>
not be performed of any but by his appointment. The men thus strucken with this holy fire, hasted them ouer into Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy to make their complaint vnto the king, who infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely grieued at this kinde of dealing, cursed the time that euer he made him Archbishop, or restored him to his place againe, adding, it was his chaunce euer to do for vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men, otherwise some or other would long ere this haue made this proud priest an example to all such troublesome perturbers of his realme and state. It happened amongst other, fower knights to be present at this spéech of the kings, who gathered thereby, they should do a deed very acceptable vnto him if they killed the Archbishop. Their names were <hi>Reynald Fitz-Vrse, Hugh de Mortuill, William de Tracy, and Richard Briton.</hi> In this meane time the Archbishop was come to Canterbury, and was receiued there with great ioy. Thence he went to London and so to Woodstocke where the yoong king then lay. But before he could get to the kings presence, word was brought him, the kings pleasure was he should first go to Canterbury and reuoke those excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations before he the king would talke with him. So he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned againe to Canterbury without seeing the king at all. Soone after his returne thither, the fower knights before mentioned arriued at Canterbury, to wit vpon Innocents day. They comming vnto the Archbishop, told him the kings pleasure was, he should goe to his sonne and reuerently make offer of doing homage and fealty vnto him, for the Barony of his Archbishopricke: secondly, that he should cause all the strangers he brought into the realme with him to be sworne to his obedience; and thirdly, that he should retrcat those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications which he had caused to be denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the instruments of the yoong kings coronation.

At euening prayer time the same day, they came suddenly into the church, with their swords drawen, crying, Wheres the Traytor, Wheres the Traytor: The Archbishop who was then going vp the steps toward the quire, hearing the noyse, turned backe vnto them, and euery one of the fower striking mainely at him, vpon the third or fourth greice of those stops was slaine. His body these knights had determined to haue cast into the sea, or else to haue hewen into a thousand pieces: but the Prior and the monkes doubting some such thing, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it immediately in the vndercraft, whence shortly it was taken vp and laid in a most sumptuous shrine in the East end of the church. The Pope hearing of this massacre, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated immediately all that were either authors or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters to the same. The king was faine to purge himselfe by othe, and yet could not be absolued before he had done certaine strange penance as first, that he should pray deuout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the tombe of this new Martyr, that he should be whipt in the chapter house, receiuing of euery monke one lash, that he should maintaine 200. soldiers for the space of one yeere at Jerusalem, &amp; lastly reuoke the declaration published at Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindon, that originally gaue the occasion of this murther.

Much adoo there was there about it the space of nine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes. At last the Bishops got a mandate wherein the Monkes and they were commaunded to ioyne together. The day of election was appointed, but the Monkes for curst
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3306:32"/>
hart would not come vnto it. So the Bishops procéeded and made choice of <hi>Baldwin</hi> Bishop of Worcester. This election the monkes labored mightily to disanul; professing, that they liked the man elect very well, but they must not indure such a president. The king therefore (who fauoured <hi>Baldwin</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly) wrought so with one party and the other, as the Monkes were content to elect him, vpon condition he would renounce all benefite of his former election, and the Bishops themselues would confesse the same to be void and of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. All this was done and he receiued into quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able possession of this Metropoliticall sée. This <hi>Baldwin</hi> was a poore mans sonne and borne in Excester. He was first a schoolemaster, then entred into orders and became an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deadon: his Archdeaconry he voluntarily resigned, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to forsake the world, became a Cistercian or white Monke. Hauing liued so a certaine space, he was made Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of Ford in Deuonshire. From thence he was called to the Bishopricke of Worcester consecrate thereunto the yéere 1181. translated to Canterbury in the end of the yéere 1184. and solemnely installed there May 19. 1185. being the first white Monke that euer was Archbishop. <hi>Giraldus Cambr.</hi> describeth the person of the man in this sort. He was of complexion somewhat swarthy, his countenance simple and like a plaine meaning man but very comely, his stature indifferent, well made of body, but slender timbred. For his maners, he was modest and sober, of such abstinence, as fame durst neuer stamp any sinister report vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, of few words, slowe to anger, and very studious from his very childhood. It is a woonder that a man of this disposition should be so much troubled as he was: with the King he alwaies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed very well: But betwéene the Monkes of Canterbury and him there was much and continuall debate. The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion thereof was this. The king greatly misliking the inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Monkes, thought to wrest from them the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence of choosing the Archbishop in time to come by this deuice. He gaue direction vnto <hi>Baldwin</hi> their Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop, to beginne the foundation of a Colledge at Hacking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton now called Saint Stephens being distant from Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury about halfe a mile. This Colledge it was deuised
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3306:33"/>
should haue one prebend erected by the king, and by euery seuerall Bishop of that prouince of Canterbury one other, which should euer be of the gift and patronage of their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. As for the Archbishop, the building of the church and other edifices was appointed vnto him for his share, which he intended to performe with great magnificence. The ende of this foundation was none other then this, that it might be a meane of traducing the right of election of the Archbishop, (a matter greatly importing the king and the whole realme) from the monkes (men of little learning, lesse discretion, and smalest experience in matters of gouernment, yet very obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and altogether wedded to their owne wils) to other men, in whom the king and the rest of the Bishops (as being their patrones) might chalenge an interest. For the better execution of this plot, it was ordained, that this colledge should be dedicated vnto Saint Thomas, who was now growen so famous throughout the world, as euery man thought himselfe happy that could do any thing to his honor. In regard hereof they made no doubt, but the Pope would soone be intreated to take from Christ (vnto whose name the monastery of Canterbury was consecrate) all priuiledge of election, and to confer the same with many other vpon Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> that famous martyr. The matter was now very forward and growen to good perfection, in so much as the foundations were digged, stone, timber, and other prouision laide ready in place for the building, when as the subtile monkes suspecting wherunto this great forwardnesse of the king and Bishops tended, made their complaint at Rome. That notwithanding, on went the worke: The church part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly built was solemnely consecrate, and diuers secular priests (such Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> himselfe was) instituted and installed into their prebends, when the monks that neuer linne laying on load by requests, gifts and al maner of importunate sute to disturbe this platforme, procured the Pope to set downe an order, that this corporation should be dissolued, the buildings thereof rased and made euen to the ground. Such were the times, the Popes pleasure was aneuitable necessity; it must be and was performed. It happened then soone after that <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> the Pope died, who was a great protector of the monkes

cause. <hi>Gregory</hi> the eight succéeded, a man with whom <hi>Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyn</hi> might do very much. He determined therfore once more to set on foote his former deuise, but in another place. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured of the Bishop and Couent of Rochester, for exchange of other land, a certaine quantity of ground at Lambhith, where the Archbishops pallace and house of chiefe residence is now situate. Thither he caused to be brought by water all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision of stones, timber, &amp;c. that was intended to the building of the colledge at Hackington, and began the foundation of a goodly church there, which he liued not to finish. King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> the first to expiate the fault of his rebellion &amp; disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto his father, determined to carry a great power into the holy land. <hi>Baldwyn</hi> would néedes attend him thither, and did so. By preaching, counsell, liberall almes, and continuall erample of a most vertuous life, he did great good there, vntill at last in the siege of the city of Acon being taken with a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous sicknesse he died, when he had béene Archbishop euen almost seuen yéeres, and was buried there. He gaue all his goods vnto the soldiers to be diuided amongst them at the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of <hi>Hubert</hi> the Bishop of Salisbury, that soone after succeeded him.</p>

                  </gap> in his life time, and at his death trusted him with
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3306:34"/>
the disposition of all his goods. Being yet Deane of Yorke, he bought certaine land of <hi>Geoffry Fitz Geoffry</hi> in West Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham where he was borne, and founded a monastery in the same for his owne soules health (so himselfe speaketh in his foundation) as also for the soules of his father, mother, <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulphde Glandfeld,</hi> and <hi>Berta</hi> his wife who brought him vp. The manner of his election vnto Canterbury was this. The king writ earnestly to the Couent to choose some wise, quiet, &amp; moderate man, but refrayned to name any, in regard of the former repulses taken by him and his father. But his minde and particular desire could not be vnknowen vnto them. He signified vnto <hi>Elianor</hi> his mother, to the Archbishop of Roan and other, what course he wished to be taken: And so wisely they handled the matter, as before any man looked for it, the monkes (who well saw how greatly it imported the realme in that dangerous time to haue some woorthy prelate in that place) had elected him and published suddenly their election at Paules crosse, to the great contentment of the Quéene and councell, and no lesse ioy of all other sorts and states of people. While his pall was fetching at Rome, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how odious <hi>Baldwyn</hi> had beene to his Monkes of Canterbury for not beeing a Monke as themselues were and in a manner all his predecessors had béene; went to Merton and there professed him selfe a Monke in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as <hi>Regmald</hi> the last Archbishoppe had done. Then he began to bestir him in leuiyng of money for the kings ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some. So discretly he wrought, as the Cleargy aud commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the whole realme did very willingly yéeld a quarter of all their reuenues for one yéere, which (together with the plate and ornaments of Churches that were fame to be sold in this extrenuty) amounted vnto 150000. marks, the sum required by the Emperor. The king returning, made him presently Lord Chauncelor, chiefe Justice of England, and high gouernor of all his dominions immediately vnder him. So that being already Archbishop and the Popes Logate, he wanted no authority that was possible to be laid vpon him. Neuer was there any Cleargy man either before or after him of so great power, neuer any man vsed his authority more moderately. He was blamed and much enuied for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3306:35"/>
so many offices vpon him. It is remembred that a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man said vnto him in scorne, at what time he was made Chauncellor, I haue heard of many Chauncellors made Bishops, but of an Archbishop that would vouchsafe to stoup to the Chauncellorship, till now I neuer heard of any. With in two yéers after his first promotion to these high places, the better to excuse his ambition, he made a dissembling and counterfeit shew of being desirous to leaue these temporall offices, in so much as, he dealt effectually with the king by letters to giue him leaue to resigne them, saying, that the charge of his Church was worke ynough for one man, whereunto onely he would hereafter gladly dedicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. This he did, assuring him selfe in his owne conceite, that the king had no man about him so likely to manage those affaires as him selfe, and not being able to want him, would intreate him to retaine them still. It fell out otherwise then he expected: For though at first the king séemed and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture was vnwilling to yéeld to this his request, yet he found it so reasonable in the end, as he could not any longer deny the same. Here now this Archbishop manifestly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayed his insatiable desire of rule and gouernment: Being thus taken tardy in his owne snare; as though his mind and determination were sodainely altered, he signified vnto the king by letters, that notwithstanding his great desire of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking himselfe onely to spirituall matters and the manifold infirmities of his age; he would be content to afford his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor and diligence in his other offices yet a while longer, if therein he might doo him any profitable seruice. And that the king should not think it possible to prouide himselfe elsewhere of better officers, he certified him withall, that in these two yéeres since his preferment, he had gathered for his vse 1100000. marks which he was ready to pay into his cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, augmenting it is like the summe, and adding thereto out of his owne purse, that so he might in cleanly sort buy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againe those honorable and gainfull offices, which his subtile dissimulation had almost lost him. Setting this fault aside whereunto the greatest wits are most subiect (I meane am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition) he was an excellent and memorable man, a bridle (saith on) vnto the king, and an obstacle of tyranny, the peace
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3306:35"/>
and comfort of the people, &amp; lastly a notable refuge of all both high and low against all manner of iniury and oppression. Faithfull and loyall he was vnto his Prince, louing aud ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry carefull of his Countrey, in which he caused many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent lawes to be established; He it was that first deuised our assise of bread, our waights &amp; measures of wine, oyle, corne, &amp;c. Uery valiant he was also and performed many great ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices in the warres, the report whereof I leaue vnto the Chronicles. His house kéeping they say was such, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence thereof was thought to be nothing inferior vnto the kings: And yet he performed many great workes of inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable charge. Beside the monastery of Derham before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, he also founded another for Cistercian Monkes at Wulferhampton, but liued not to finish the same; he compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Tower of London with a strong wall and a déepe moate, so as the water inclosed the same quite round, which before that time could neuer be brought to passe; he encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the reuenues of his sée uery much, adorned it with many sumptuous and stately buildings, and lastly procured diuers notable priuileges vnto the same, called in olde English, Gled, Dangeld, Hidage, Warpon, Bloodwhite, Childwhite, Uillenage, &amp;c. Now notwithstanding this his great power and riches, with the monkes of Canterbury he had as much to doo as other of his predecessors. By intreaty and faire meanes he indeuoured to procure their consent for the finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Chappell at Lambhith begun by <hi>Baldwin,</hi> sor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their leaue to goe about it, he knew it was to no purpose. To this end he sent vnto them the Abbots of Waltam, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and Chertsey, to debate this matter with them. The very mention thereof was so odious vnto them, as by and by they made a great complaint vnto the Pope not only of this, but many other things also, especially of his intermedling in ciuill affaires. Hereupon the Pope presently enioyned him, without farther delay to resigne all his temporall offices, which he (how loath soeuer) was faine to doo. As for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Chappell, after it had hung long in the Popes court, the parties grew to a composition, that vpon condition it were pulled downe, it should be lawfull for the Archbishop to build another vpon a new foundation, to endue the same with an
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3306:36"/>
hundred pound a yéere reuenues and no more, and lastly to place in the same twentie Canons or Prebendaries. Mary it was conditioned, that no Bishops in any wise should be consecrate there, no Abbots admitted, no orders admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, &amp;c. After this, the rest of his daies he ended in peace. King <hi>Iohn</hi> that had attempted many times to depose his brother King <hi>Richard,</hi> and was alwaies hindered in those practises by the diligence faithfulnesse and wisedome of this worthy Prelate, estranged him selfe a while from him, and gaue him no countenance. But finding at last how ill he might spare him, vsed his counsell, receiued intertaiment of him (which was very royall) at Canterbury; trusted him with the gouernment of the whole realme at his departure into Normandy, and affoorded him many other gratious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours. Hauing béene Archbishop twelue yéeres sauing fower moneths, he fell into a kinde of ague vpon the way as he was riding to Rochester to worke an agréement betwéene the Bishop and the monkes there, turned into his mannour of Tenham, made his will, and lying sicke there onely fower daies departed this life. He was buried July 13. 1205. in the South wall of the church beside the quier néere <hi>Walter Reynald,</hi> that long after succéeded him.</p>

This done, he thought all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles at an end, when the worst of all was yet behind: For he bare himselfe so bold vpon the Popes fauour (which he had bought deerely) as he doubted not to oppresse diuers of his nobility, with many and continuall wrongs, reuoking all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer graunts of priuiledges at his pleasure vpon this point, that he had receiued his kingdome from the Pope absolutely, free from all entanglement of any priuiledges deriued from the same.

During the time of this ceremony, all passengers from London to Canterbury were allowed horsemeat at the Arthbishops charge, who also caused vessels of wine to runne continually in diuers parts of the city all the day of this translation, that who so list might drinke of them. This solemnity prooued so chargeable vnto him, as neither he, nor fower of his successors were able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer the debt, he cast his Sée and Church into. He was Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop in all two and twentie yéeres, and died July 9. 1228. at his mannor of Slyndon in Sussex, from whence his body was conueighed to Canterbury, and there buried in the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Saint Michaell. This man was admirably learned, and writ many notable workes, the Catalogue whereof is to be séene in Bale.

So to a second election they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeded, and chose one <hi>Iohn</hi> their Subprior: He went to Rome and being examined by certaine Cardinals, was adiudged fit ynough for the place; Yet the Pope misliked him for his age, and perswaded the good old man to forbeare to take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him so great a charge in his olde yéeres. He yéelded: and thereupon a third was elected, one <hi>Richard Blundy</hi> a studient of Oxford.

Bishop of Winchester, wherewith it was thought he féed well the monkes that chose him.

Both the king and the Couent liking well ynough of the man, he was consecrate at Canterbury by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> Bishop of London ann. 1234.

knowing him to be a very vnlearned and vnsufficient man. Héereupon the moonks appealed to Rome, which the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop vnderstanding of, hasted him thither also. <hi>Otto</hi> the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate endeuoured to stay him at home, and failing thereof, did his errand so well at Rome, as not onely in that sute, but an other also which he had against <hi>Hugh</hi> Earle of Arundell in an other cause of appeale, he was ouerthrowne and condemned in a thousand markes charges to his great disgrace and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouerishment. Being at Rome he had complained of many great abuses in England, and amongst the rest, of the long vacacy of Bishoprickes The Pope séemed willing to redresse these things, and namely concerning that matter, set downe this order, that if any cathedrall Church continued voide aboue sixe monethes, it should be lawfull for the Archbishop to conferre it where he list, as well as any smaller benefice. The procuring of this order cost him a great sum of mony: Yet no sooner was his backe turned, but the Pope at the kings request reuoked the same. Being thus continually vexed, thwarted, and disgraced, he departed into voluntary exile, and there bewailing the misery of his countrey, spoyled and wasted by the tyranny of the Pope, spent the rest of his life in continuall teares.

The king therefore doubting least the Pope would reiect him, caused in a manner all the Bishops and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots of England to write their letters commendatory in his behalfe, and so sent him to Lyons, where he quickly obtained consecration at the Popes owne hands. At his first entrance into this Sée, he found the same indebted by the ouerlashing of his predecessors, to the value of 22. thousand marks, which he tooke for an occasion of both absenting himselfe from his charge, and also of raking money togither by all kinde of meanes. Departing therefore into his owne country; by fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of woods, making leases and other such like meanes, he made an infinite deale of money, promising to imploy the same and whatsoeuer he could saue by liuing priuately at home, in the payment of his churches debt. By the same pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence also he induced the Pope to graunt him in Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam the Bishopricke of Ualentia in Prouence and diuers other spirituall promotions. But he gaue himselfe to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and spent all he could make in hyring of soldiers. When therefore (notwithstanding all these helpes) the debt was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the lesse, he was glad by bribing the Pope with a great summe of money, to procure of him a graunt of the profite of all spirituall preferments that should be void within his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince for the space of seuen yéeres. The king a while spurned at this graunt, but in the end halfe for feare of the Pope (of whom he stood in great awe) and partly by sute and interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, he ratified and allowed of the same. Hauing béene many yéeres absent, he returned into England the yéere 1250. and tooke vpon him to visite all his Prouince in some extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie manner.

Telling them by and by he came to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site them, one of the company answered him reuerently, he was very welcome vnto them, but they were sory he came for that purpose, wherein they must disappoint him: They knew their Bishop (whose onely office it was) to be a very sufficient man for his place, and so long they must not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

They all agreeing togither, determined to send the Deane of Paules a graue and wise man to Rome, and by the letters of certaine Bishops (they knew the Pope would credite) to aduertise him of this strange disorder.

The Bishops of his prouince vnderstanding thereof, and knowing how great an inconuenience it would be to them and all their Clergy; they made a collection of two pence in the marke out of all spirituall promotions in the Prouince to be expended in sute of lawe against the Archibishop. In the meane time the king had written his letters earnestly to the Pope in the Archbishops behalfe, which so inchanted him with partialitie, as the Bishop of London vtterly despairing of any iustice, gaue ouer the matter in the plaine field: Onely thus much was obtained, that he, the Chapter of Paules, and the Couent of S. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

As soone then as he returned, he went forward in his visitation, wherein he dealt at the first somewhat mildly, but soone falling to his old byas, caused eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where such stirs and tumults, as it was long after called by the name of the troublous Uisitation. At Lincoln he fell out with the Chapter there (the Sée being then voide) about the gift of prebends and benefices which he chalenged, and had euer heretofore in the vacacy belonged vnto them. One <hi>William Lupus</hi> Archdeacon of Lincoln especially resisted him in this matter, and appealed vnto the Pope. This poore man he so vexed and hurryed with his excommunications, and all manner of molestation he could deuise, as at last he enforced him to hide himselfe and to steale secretly to Rome, where he was so pitied, as the Pope was entreated not only to absolue him, but to protect him from the violence of <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi> and at last to iudge the controuersie of his side. So home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he got him with assured hope of restoring his church to her auncient priuiledge. But being worne out with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual trauel and vexation which he had indured three yéeres, vpon the way he died. Now while he was abroad in the rest of his prouince, his monkes of Christ church in Canterbury had procured of the Pope a Charter of immunity from all visitation. This being tendred vnto him at Saint Albons, he made no more adoo, but cast it in the fire. The matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing complained of both to the Pope and the king, no redresse could be found. The king durst not disgrace him for feare of offending his Quéene to whom he was vncle, and the Pope, partly for his kinreds sake (that were mighty men and his néere neighbours) partly because he was his instrument for polling of England, and brought him in much money, would hardly giue eare vnto any accusation against him. This boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous visitation ended, he got him beyond sea, and with

The king taking this speech of his in very euill part, told him he was content to do as he wished him, and because saith he, it is indéed great reason that I should fauour woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men of my owne nation before any vnwoorthy stranger.

England the Pope his creator (as he called him) sent vnto him a mandate of making payment of 4000. markes vpon very short warning, or else assured him to be spéedily excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate.

Behold you haue created me: And if the creature cannot but desire naturally what perfection the creator can yéeld, how can I but resort vnto you for succour in all my oppressions &amp; calamities. I receiued of late certaine letters horrible to sée and fearefull to heare, denouncing, that except I make pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 4000. marks that I became indebted vnto certaine Merchants of Luca at Rome within the space of a moneth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Michaelmas next, I was to be excommunicate with bell, booke, and candle, and that excommunication to be published in my Church, &amp;c. Then (to make short) he declareth how his predecessor at his departure caried away all the mooue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able goods belonging to the Sée, that <hi>Boniface</hi> had left all his houses very ruinous, that the King had taken vp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, one yéeres profitte of his lands that in the meane space he was faine himselfe to liue vpon credit, and that to borow to serue his necessary vses (the realme being so exhaust with contiuuall payments) it was excéeding hard. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard héereof, he besought him (whom onely in truth the matter concerned, though merchants of Luca bore the name of this debt) to order the matter so, as he might be allowed a yéeres day of paiment, which at last with much adoo was granted him by the sute of <hi>Robert Kilwardby</hi> his predecessor, who died (as before is rehearsed) soone after. The new Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop then became a suter vnto the Pope, that he would cause to be restored vnto his Church fiue thousand markes, the value whereof, the said <hi>Robert</hi> had caried away with him of the goods belonging to his Sée.

In the first yéere of his consecration he sommoned a Conuocation at Lambhith, at what time the Archbishop of Yorke comming to London, caused his crosse to be borne before him within the Prouince
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:3306:45"/>
of Canterbury which the Archbishop of Canterbury tooke to be a great wrong vnto him and his Sée. It had béene often in question heretofore whether it might be done or no, and much adoo there had béene about it. Therefore to redresse this abuse quickly and good cheape, our Frier deuised this course to be taken. He caused proclamations to be made in all places where he vnderstood the other Archbishop meant to passe, in which he commaunded all men vnder paine of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to affoord no manner of intertainment, no not so much as bread, or drinke, vnto him or any of his company, so long as he bare vp his crosse in that manner. So except he and his traine should starue, downe must the crosse there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. The Conuocation ended, he began a generall visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his whole prouince, and being desirous to know the state of euery Dioces, went him selfe in person to most of them, vsing great lenity and gentlenesse euery where. For he was a man though very stately both in his gesture, gate, words, and all outward shew, yet of an excéeding méeke, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rile and liberall mind. He tooke great paines in labouring a peace betwéene King <hi>Edward</hi> the first, and <hi>Leolin</hi> Prince of Wales, vnto whom he went in person, and trauailed long with him, but altogether in vaine. He bare a very hard hand vpon the Jewes, whose Sinagogues he commaunded to be pulled downe to the ground throughout his prouince. But the king was a meanes to stay the execution of that comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement so farre foorth, as he would haue one Church allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto them, in the City in which with certaine restraints they should practise their ceremonies.

Many he compelled to reforme themselues according to the Canons in that behalfe, and some that refused to be conformable, he finally depriued. Abultery he was woont to punish very seuerely.

All this he sware should be performed before he might haue absolution. If some of our gentlemen were now and then thus serued, they would not be so wanton as they are.

Being ripe for the Uniuersity, he was sent to Paris. There he procéeded Master of art, and before his departure thence was chosen Rector of that Uniuersity. Hauing passed through that office (which séemeth to be annuall) with great commendation of integrity and wisedome, he returned into England, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Oxford, gaue such proofe there of his excellent knowledge in all good learning by preaching, disputing, &amp;c. as they thought good to honour him with the degrée of a Doctor, and shortly after made him Chauncellor of their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersity. His gouernment there was such, as all men easily discerned him fit for a much higher place. He made many good and profitable statutes, and tooke away diuers fond and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious customes, to the great honor of the Uniuersity, and no lesse aduauncement of good learning. His first spirituall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion was a prebend in Paules church and the Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conry of Esser. His Archdeacoury he visited himselfe in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son duly euery yeere, and did reside vpon his prebend, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in that cathedral church or some other place almost eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day. By reason hereof &amp; his manifold good parts, he grew so famous, as <hi>Peckham</hi> being dead, he was straightway pointed out by the expectation of all men vnto the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke. The monkes therefore chose him with the kings very good liking &amp; great applause of all men. It was his cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to come to Rome while <hi>Coelestious</hi> was Pope, a good &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous man, but so simple, as <hi>Boniface</hi> that succéeded him could perswade him by counterfeiting the voice of an Angell through a trunke in the night, to resigne his Papacy and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an Heremite againe, as before his election he had beene. Not onely this simple Heremite, but euen all the prelates
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3306:47"/>
and Cardinals there were amased at his woonderfull rare learning, the like whereof (especially to be ioined with such discretion and wisedome) they well assured themselues was no where to be found. They were desirous therefore to haue made him a Cardinall so to haue retained him amongst them: But he yéelding many reasons why he might not be spared at home, obtained at last consecration and hasted him vnto his charge. Upon the day of his inthronization, it is said he consecrated Bishop of Landaffe one <hi>Iohn Mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> Doctor of Diuinity, and bestowed twenty benefices, ten of very good value vpon ten Doctors, and ten lesse vpon ten Batchelers of Diuinity. The Sée being yet voide, the king had caused a conuocation to be summoned, in which he required one halfe of all ecclesiasticall reueneues for one yéere toward the charge of his wars. This intollerable exaction the cleargy not intending to yéeld vnto, sent the Deane of Paules <hi>William de Montfort</hi> with diuers other Prelates vnto the king to craue pardon, and to shew how hard it were for them to yéeld to this demaund. Being admitted vnto his presence, the Deane began his spéech, and after a few words fell downe suddenly starke dead. Herewith the king nothing mooued, sent a knight the next day vnto the conuocation to know whether any of them durst withstand the king in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund: if there be any such (quoth he) let him come foorth that I may take order with him as a disturber of the kings peace. So no man daring to gainesay it, the graunt passed for good. The Archbishop now comming home soone after, called another Synode, wherein his cleargy complained much of the last exaction. The Archbishop told them it was more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> that they had done, for that in the late Councell of Lyons it was decréed, no cleargy man should pay any thing to any temporall magistrate without the Popes licence: that therefore they now set downe for a canon to be kept hereafter inuiolably. At that time the king that had had so liberall allowance very lately, demaunded nothing. But within a yéere or two after hauing spent an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite deale of money in the conquest of Scotland, he summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a Parliament at Berwicke, wherein when the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty contributed liberally toward the charge of that warre,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3306:47"/>
the cleargy alleaging the foresaid canon, would graunt no thing. The king would not take this for payment: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore presently he tooke order, that all barnes of cleargy men should be locked vp: he also made proclamation that from that time forward, all cleargy men were excluded from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his protection, so that hereafter it should be lawfull for any man to sue them, but they might not commence sute against any other. This constrained them to yéeld, and all submitted themselues to allowance of such a proportion as the king li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked (it was a fift part of their reuenewes) except onely the Archv. who would make no other answere vnto the king but this, vnder God our vniuersall Lord, saith he, we haue two other Lords, a spirituall Lord the Pope, and a temporall Lord the king, and though we be to obey both, yet rather the spirituall Lord then the temporall.

For this contumacy the king caused all his goods to be seased into his hands, and made shew of greater displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Shortly after, notwithstanding being to make warre in Fraunce, before his departure he thought good to receiue the Archbishop to fauour againe, but this grace indured for a very little while. Presently vpon his returne, he laid diuers treasons to his charge, as that he had dehorted his subjects in his absence from payment of their subsidies, that he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired with diuers of his nobility to depriue him of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to crowne his sonne <hi>Edward, &amp;c.</hi> Whether the Archbishop were guilty of all the crimes obiected against him or no, I cannot tell. But certaine it is, that as guilty, he submitted himselfe to the kings mercy, and besought him for the same in most humble manner, or rather in déede deiected himselfe more basely, and lamented his cause more passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately then became a man that were guiltlesse, much lesse a prelate that would be esteemed, graue, learned or wise. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this his submission, the king commenced a complaint against him at Rome, banished him the realme, and seased vpon all his goods, mooueable and vnmooueable, forbidding all his subiects vpon great paine to foster him or yéeld him any manner of intertainment. He was in that case
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:3306:48"/>
he must haue starued for want of sustenance, had not the monkes of Canterbury secretly taken him in and aduentured to yéeld him things necessary, till they found meanes to shift him beyond sea; which the king afterwards vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, seased vpon all their goods and lands, turned them all euen fowerscore monks a begging, forbid all men to harbour them, and kept them in that miserable state, till after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine space he was content to restore them againe. These were the violent courses were taken by Princes in those daies: how happy are we that in all peace, liberty and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, quietly enioy our owne without great desert to the contrary? Two yéeres the Archbishop continued in exile: In which time the king <hi>(Edward</hi> the first) died, and his sonne <hi>Edward</hi> the second that was to succeed, thinking it conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent belike at his first entrance to shew all examples of cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, called him home by letters, and restored him to all his goods, euen euery peny of that which had béene receiued of his temporalties in his absence. Hereby it came to passe that he was the richest Archbishop of many that were, either before or after him, so that his trouble turned him to great good. In regard whereof, he was woont to say <q>(Nihil nocebit aduersitas vbi nulla iniquitas dominatur)</q> so often as he talked of his trouble and banishment. He was no sooner come home but a new danger encountred him occasioned by his owne woonted boldnesse. The yoong king by the counsell of <hi>Piers Gaueston</hi> (a wanton and vicious man, banished into Ireland by king <hi>Edward</hi> the first for corrupting his sonne) had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Bishop of Couentry to ward at Yorke: A conuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation being gathered, the Archbishop would not suffer any matter to be debated in the house till the Bishop were set at liberty. This the king was content to beare with all at that time, &amp; afterward he so behaued himselfe, as there neuer grew any dislike betwéene them. So the rest of his age after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from banishment (which was sixe yéeres) he passed in quietnes and great prosperity, and died at last at Oxford, May 11. 1313. hauing béene Archbishop about the space of ninetéene yéeres. He was a stout prelate and a seuere punisher of sinne. He opposed himselfe against <hi>Piers Gaueston,</hi> the <hi>Spensers,</hi> and other corrupters of the yoong king very boldly.

He enforced <hi>Iohn Warren</hi> Earle of Surrey to sorsweare the company of a certaine beautifull harlot, with the loue of whom he was greatly bewitched. And afterwards when notwithstanding his oath he returned to her company againe and got children vpon her, he accused him to the Conuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of adultery and periury both, and at last made him to leaue her. Such preferments as fell to his disposition, he euer bestowed vpon men of excellent learning, despising letters and requests of noble men, which he estéemed not a rush. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poore schollers he maintained at the Uniuersities with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall exhibition, and vnto all kind of poore people was excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding bountiful, insomuch as therin I thinke he excelled all the Archbishops that euer were, either before him or after him. Beside the daily fragments of his house, he gaue euery Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day and Sunday vnto euery begger that came to his doore a loase of bread of a farthing price (which no doubt was bigger then our peny-loafe now.) And there were vsually euery such almes day in time of dearth to the number of 5000. but in a plentifull 4000. and seldome or neuer vnder, which <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mumbus annis</hi> amounted vnto 500. pound a yéere. Ouer and aboue this, he vsed to giue euery great festiuall day 150. pence to so many poore people, to send daily meate, drinke and bread vnto such as by reason of age or sicknes were not able to fetch almes at his gate, &amp; to send money, meate, apparel &amp;c. to such as he thought wanted the same, and were ashamed to begge. But of all other, he was woont to take greatest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion vpon those that by any misfortune were decaied and had fallen from wealth to poorer estate. For these and other vertues, the common people would needes estéeme him a Saint, and frequented much the place of his buriall: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his tombe (which was situate beside the altar of S, <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> néere the south wall) was afterwards pulled downe. His bookes, apparell, and other mooueables (which were but of very small value) he gaue all such as they were vnto his church of Canterbury.

               <p>
                  <hi>RObert Winchelsey</hi> being dead, the monks of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1313"/> elected for his successour one <hi>Thomas Cobham</hi> that was Deane of Salisbury, and Prebendary of Yorke, a man of such vertue and learning, as he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called by the name of the good Clerke. The king <hi>(Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the second) was desirous to preferre vnto that place <hi>Walter Raynolds</hi> Bishop of Worcester; whom he fauoured singularly for his assured fidelity and great wisedome. Before therefore that the saide <hi>Thomas Cobham</hi> could get away to Rome, the king vnderstanding of his election, sent thither in all post haste, earnestly requesting the Pope to finde meanes that this <hi>Walter</hi> might be made Archbishop. He glad of such an occasion to exercise the vtmost of his vsurped authority, without any more adoo, thrust in the said <hi>Walter Raynolds</hi> into that Sée, pretending, that he had reserued the gift of the Archbishoprick for that time vnto himselfe before it fell. <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> a while stoode vpon the right of his election, but percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to how little purpose it was to stirre with so mighty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries as the Pope and the king both at once, was content to accept of the Bishopricke of Worcester which the other left. This <hi>Walter</hi> had béene a Courtier a long time, Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyne first vnto <hi>Edward</hi> the first, and Parson of Wimberton, then by <hi>Edward</hi> the second (whose schoolemaster some say he was) made Treasurer and Chauncellour of England, and preferred to the Bishopricke of Worcester the yéere 1308. The buls of his translation were published in Bowe Church Ianuary 4. 1313. He receaued his pall Febr. 17. following, and was installed with great pompe and solemnity April 19. in the presence of the king the Quéene and many nobles. The first thing he did after his comming to Canterbury, was to take order by giuing pensions and diuers sums of money at Rome, that appeales made from him to the court there should finde no fauourable intertainment. He precured also eight seuerall Buls, containing so many great and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie priuileges. The first gauc him authority of visiting all his prouince, so as he should haue procurations euery where,

and yet his charges borne; The second to visite monasteries and all other exempt places; The third to absolue and restore to their former state two hundred Cleargy men that had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred irregularitie; The fourth to dispense with the Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of a hundred Clearks, and enable them to take spirituall liuings; The fifth to absolue a hundred of such as by striking any Cleargy man had fallen into the danger of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; The sixt, to grant forty pluralities; The seuenth, to require the gift of any one dignitie or spirituall promotion in any church or college where he should visite; The eight, to grant pardon of a hundred daies in any place where he should visite, preach, giue almes, or kéepe hospitality. Being thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, he perfourmed his visitation, trauailing himselfe in the same till by the Barons wars he was hindered, and sent for vnto the Court by the king. That warre being ended, and execution done vpon diuers of the nobles that had rebelled: <hi>Adam Tarlton</hi> Bishop of Hereford was apprehended and brought to the barre to be arraigned for the like fault. All the Bishops of England almost were then at London. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops of Canterbury, Yorke, and Dublin hearing of it, in great haste hied them thither, and hauing their crosses borne before them, entred the court, by violence tooke the prisoner from the barre, and carried him away with them. Much adoo there was about this matter a good while: &amp; the stir was not quight ended when the Quéene rising against her husband, and setting vp her sonne to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

This our Archb. then shewed himselfe a very weake man: He was content a while out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to stand with the king (as beside the common duty of a subiect, he was bound to do by benefites receaued infinite) but first vnderhand he aided the Queene with great sums of money, and at last vtterly for sooke him, his lawfull prince, his master, his patron that had aduaunced him by so many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées vnto an estate so honorable.

He was buried in the south wall of Christs church in Canterbury néere the Quier, where his tombe is yet to be seene, with an inscription which I haue read long since, but I thinke is now defaced. This man was but meanly learned, yet very wise &amp; of good gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, except when for feare and want of courage he neglected his dutie.

Being famous for his learning and good gouernment of that iurisdiction, <hi>Walter</hi> the Archbishop made him his principall Officiall and Deane of the Arches, and king <hi>Edward</hi> the second shortly after that appointed him Secretary, and so one of his priuy counsell.

It fell out according to that ominous prediction. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer I thinke any Archb. either before or after him, giuing so little cause, &amp; dooing his indeuour to please, was more encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with vndeserued and often crosses. He had no sooner set foote into this Bishopricke of Winchester, but the king (who at that time was altogether ruled by the said <hi>Robert Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock)</hi> caused all his goods to be seased, and his liuings to be sequestred to his vse. Moreouer, he caused him to be summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by certaine strange kind of writs to appeare I know not where; and when for feare he was faine to hide himselfe, proclamation was made that no man should dare to harbor him, or giue him any kind of entertainment by meate, lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:3306:51"/>
or otherwise. Hauing endured these miseries the space of a yéere, he intreated the Archbishop to be an intercessor vnto the king for him; who relating vnto him how dishono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a thing it was for him to persecute a true subiect so terribly, both for an other mans fault, and an other mans pleasure too; he was soone woonne to receiue the poore Bishop to his grace, and laid all the blame of that iniury vpon <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Baldock.</hi> Being thus restored, he grew dayly more and more into the kings fauour, whom he serued both diligently and faithfully to the last hower. When all other forsooke him, euen <hi>Walter</hi> the Archbishop of whom he had deserued so notably; this good Bishop would neuer be allured vnto the contrary part by any meanes; in so much as, the Quéene and <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> began to deuise how they might make him away. This he being certified of, hid him selfe, and was faine so to hold him selfe close a long time. In the ende, the king being dead, and all his fauourites or partakers either executed, or otherwise consumed; the Quéene and her sonne king <hi>Edward</hi> the third, wel knowing they had nothing to lay against this man, but that he was true and loyall to his Prince, they were content not onely to receiue him to their fauour, but also to make him Lord Chauncellor of England. <hi>Simon Mepham</hi> the Archbishop being then dead soone after, the king was also content to write earnestly vnto the Pope to preferre him vnto that Sée of Canterbury. He did so (as before I haue said.) And the monkes thinking it good to make a vertue of necessity, they forsooth elected him also. About this time it hapened that King <hi>Edward</hi> the third began to lay claime vnto the crowne of Fraunce, and passing the seas with a great power to iustifie his claime; he thought good to commit the gouernment of the realme here at home vnto the Archbishop. He beside other generall promises of faithfulnes diligence, &amp;c. In the charge deliuered vnto him, assured the king he should want no money to expend in this exploit; whereunto all kind of people shewed them selues so willing to yéelde what helpe they possibly might, as he tooke vpon him to discerne, the king might commaund of them what he list. He was not deceiued in this coniecture: For no sooner was the king ouer the seas, but infinite summes of money
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:3306:51"/>
were collected with the very good liking of all people. This money (which all men thought would haue maintained the charge of that warre two or thrée yéeres, the king being yoong and so easie to be either mistaken or deceiued) was spent in lesse then one yeere. The Archbishop meruelling thereat, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the king by letters, to remooue from him such as had had the disposing of his treasure, for that without imbesilling and falsehood it was impossible so much money should be so soone consumed. The king on the other side, he put the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop in minde of his promise, and called vpon him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually for more money. He well knowing how hard it would be to collect any reasonable summe so soone after so liberall contribution as had béene lately yéelded; fell to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading the king to accept reasonable conditions, which he heard the French King had offred him and to come home. The king either was or seemed to be excéeding angry with this motion: yet knowing there was no remedy but he must get him home, his money being now spent, and his credite amongst the vsurers stretched to the highest pinne; He tolde his souldiers on the one side that the Archbishop had betraied him vnto the French king, who no doubt had hired him to detaine their pay in his hands; and on the other side made his creditors beleeue that the Archbishop had taken vpon him the discharge of all his debt, as hauing now gathered money suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for that purpose. So the discontentment of these peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being either alaied, or cast vpon the Archbishop, it was deuised that for the farther countenance of this plot, the king should step ouer into England sodainly, and cast into prison the Archbishop, togither with the Bishop of Chichester the Chauncelour, and the Bishop of Lichfield the Treasurer. To London he came secretly in a night, caught the two Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and sent them to the Tower; but the Archbishop by meere chance was gone from Lambhith elsewhether the day before, and hauing some inkling afterwards of that was meant vnto him, got him to Canterbury and there stood vpon his guard. A knight was sent vnto him to require him to make present paiment of a certaine huge sum of mony which the king said he had taken vp of outlandish merchants vpon his (the Archbi.) credit, or else to get him ouer the seas imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:3306:52"/>
vnto them, and to yéeld them his body till the debt were satisfied, for that so the king had vndertaken he should, being animated thereunto by his owne promise. Soone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there came certaine messengers from the duke of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant desiring to speake with the Archbishop, and when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to conferre with them, cited him by writings to make payment of certaine great summes of money, which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged he ought to the Duke for money the king of England had receaued. This citation they fixed vpon the high crosse at Canterbury with many ceremonies. Now the Archbishop perceauing what a terrible tempest was growing toward him, (for he was charged not onely with the debt of many thousand pounds more then euer he should be able to make, but with horrible treason, that might not onely take away his life, but make him odious in his life time, and infamous for euer with all posterity.) He wrote many letters vnto the king, wherein he purged himselfe most cléerely of whatsoeuer was obiected, and prayed him not to commaund his repaire vnto his presence, vntil a parliament were assembled, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, if he were to be charged with any crime, he vowed to offer himselfe vnto iustice. Understanding then that the king had written diuers discourses against him vnto the Bishop of London, the couent of Canterbury and others, to the intent they might be publike; for defence of his credit, he thought it requisite to make his Apology in the pulpit, which he did, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this for his text, <hi>Non pertinuit Principem, &amp; potentia nemo vieit illum, &amp;c. Eccles. 48.</hi> At last a parliament was summoned, whereunto vpon safe conduct he came. He was not suffered to come into the parliament house before he had answered to certaine crimes obiected against him in the court of the Exchequer. He went thither and receiuing a copy of the articles promised to make answere vnto them. The next day comming againe vnto the parliament, he was once more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden entrance. A great number of people flocking about him in the meane time, he told them how he had béene sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to the parliament, whereof he was a principall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and now being come, was kept out by violence. But saith he (taking his crosse into his owne hand) I will not hence till I either be suffered to come in, or heare some cause
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:3306:52"/>
alleaged why I should not. While he stoode there, some of the company began to reuile him and to tell him he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied the realme, &amp;c. Unto whom he answered thus, The curse of almighty God (quoth he) of his blessed mother and mine also, be vpon the heads of them that informe the king so, Amen, Amen. In the meane time certaine noble men chaunced to come out, whom he besought to request the king in his behalfe. By their meanes he was at last admitted, and being charged with diuers hainous crimes, offered to purge himselfe of them, and if they might be prooued to submit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vnto iustice. Twelue men were chosen to examine this matter, viz. fower Prelates, the Bishops, of London, Bathe, Hereford and Exceter; fower Earles, Arundell, Salisbury, Huntington and Suffolke, and lastly, fower Barons, <hi>Henry Percy, Thomas Wake, Ralfe Basset,</hi> and <hi>Ralfe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>.</hi> All this was but to make the Archbishop odious with the common people: A fault was committed; And the king willing the blame therof should lie any where rather then vpon himselfe, made al this ado to bleere the peoples eies. The matter neuer came to the hearing of these nobles: but was so handled, that the Archbishop vpon great sute and intreaty of in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the whole parliament, must be pardoned all that was past, and receiued to fauour againe. After this, he liued cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine yeeres quietly. Hauing beene Archbishop about fiftéene yeeres, he fell sicke at Magfield, and making his will (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he gaue all he had vnto his seruants) died there. He was buried in a goodly tombe of alabaster on the South side of the high altar beside the steps of Saint Dunstanes altar.

               <p>
                  <hi>THomas Bradwardin</hi> (of whom somewhat is said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1349"/> was borne at Hartfield in Sussex, and brought vp in the Uniuersity of Oxford, where hauing trauay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led along time in the study of good learning, he procéeded Doctor of Diuinity. He was a good Mathematician, a great Philosopher and an excellent Diuinc, as diuers workes of his not yet perished doo testifie. But aboue all he is espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to be commended for his sinceryty of life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation. <hi>Iohn Stratford</hi> the Archbishoppe in regard of these vertues commended him vnto that noble Prince King <hi>Edward</hi> the third for his Confessor. In that office he beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him selfe so, as he deserueth eternal memory for the same. He was woont to reprehend the king with great boldnesse for such things as he sawe amisse in him. In that long and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full warre which the king had in Fraunce, he neuer would be from him, but admonished him often secretly and all his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in learned and most cloquent sermons publikely, to take heede they wared not proud and insolent because of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold victories God had sent them; but to be thankefull vnto him for them, and to haue a care to vse them moderately. Some there be that haue not doubted to ascribe that notable conquest rather to the vertue and holinesse of this man, then to any other meanes either of prowesse or wisedome in other instruments of the same. This man that might haue obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the king any preferment he would haue craued, was so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> from ambitious desire of promotion, as it was long besore he could be perswaded to take a prebend of Lincolne, when it was offred him being before that Chauncelor of Paules in London. It is certaine also, that he was elected vnto the Archbishopricke without his owne séeking, &amp; might easily haue made the king for him if he had indeuoured it. When some men maruailed that the king should refuse him, and preferre any other before him, he answered he could very ill spare him, &amp; he perceiued not he was desirous to be spard. <hi>Iohn Vfford</hi> being sodainly taken away as before is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the Couent of Canterbury once more chose him, the king
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:3306:54"/>
very willingly allowed of their choice, and the Pope hauing not yet heard of this their second election of his owne accord before any request made cast vpon him this dignity. Hardly shal you find any Archbishop in any age to haue attained his place in better sort. He was consecrate at Auinion by one <hi>Bertrand</hi> a Cardinal in the church of the Frier minors there. That ceremony once perfourmed, he hasted him home into England, where first doing his duety to the king, he receiued of him immediately his temporalties with all fauour. From the court he departed to Lambhith to rest himselfe after his long iourney. Lying there a while with the Bishop of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester, he fell sicke, and within fiue weekes and fower daies after his consecration died, so that he was neuer inthronized at all. He was buried in the chappell of Saint Anselme to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the South wall.</p>

It came to passe, within two yéeres after his death, though two other were serued before him.

His bulles were published in Bowe church, October 4. 1349. and in the moneth of December following he was consecrate by the Bishop of London in Paules church. He was inthronized secretly to saue charge. For he was a very frugal and sparing man, neuer estéeming pompe or outward brauery. He was also very seuere. When he first visited his owne Dioces, he depriued many cleargy men of their liuings. He passed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the Diocesses of Kochester and Chichester without kéeping any great adoo: So that euery one made account he was content to winke at the faults he espied. But they found
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:3306:54"/>
it otherwise: For he afterward called home vnto him the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, and there dealt so with them, as all men might as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure themselues he would prooue a very austere man in his gouernment. <hi>Iohn Synwall</hi> Bishop of Lincolne, standing in doubt of this asperity of his, with great cost procured a priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from Rome to exempt himselfe from his authority and iurisdiction But the Archbishop caused the same afterward to be reuoked. The Uniuersity of Oxford had presented vnto him the said Bish. of Lincoln (vnto whose iurisdiction Oxford then appertained) one <hi>William Palmor<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </hi> for their Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour and prayed him to admit him. The Bishop (I know not for what cause) delayed his admission from time to time, and enforced the Uniuersity to complaine of this hard dealing vnto the Archbishop. He presently set downe a day wherein he enioined the Bishop to admit this Chauncellor, or else to render a reason of his refusall. At that time appointed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Uniuersity were ready together with this <hi>William. Palmo<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

He appealed to the Pope, would not come, and for his contumacy was interdicted. Much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was spent in this sute after wards at Rome. The ende was, that the Archbishop preuailed, and the others priue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was by speciall order of the Pope reuoked, who also graunted vnto the Uniuersity at the same time that the Chauncellor hereafter should onely be elected by the schollers them selues, and so presently authorised to gouerne them without the admission of any other. This conquest thus at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiued, he entred yet into another combate in the same land, I meane at Rome. He serued <hi>Andrew Vfford</hi> Archbishop of Middlesex the Administrator of <hi>Iohn Vfford</hi> his predecessor for delapidations and recouered of him 1101. <abbr>l</abbr>. fiftéene shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings two pence halpeny farthing, that money he imployed in repairing the pallace at Canterbury. He pulled downe the manner house at Wrotham and imploied the stones and tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the same in ending the building that <hi>Iohn Vfford</hi> his
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:3306:55"/>
predecessor aforesaid had begun at Maidstone. Toward this and other charges he obtained of the Pope leaue to craue a contribution of foure pence out of euery marke from all the Cleargy of his Prouince. But his officers (whether of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, or peraduenture mistaking) demaunded and had a whole tenth. All this was within a yéere or two of his first comming to the Archbishopricke; at which time also in a Parliament held at Westminster: the yéere 1350. the old controuersie betwéen him and the Archbishop of Yorke, about bearing vp his crosse in the prouince of Canterburybegan to be renewed, was compromitted vnto the hearing and iudgement of the king, who set downe a finall order for the same, viz. that the Archbishop of Yorke should beare his crosse in the others prouince yéelding all preeminence other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise vnto Canterbury, but that in token of subiection euery Archbishop at his entrance should offer an image of gold to the value of forty pound, at the shrine of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> the same to be sent by some Knight or Doctor of the Law within the space of two monethes after his inthronizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Amongst the rest of his actions, I may not in any wise forget his Colledge of Canterbury, (which is now become a parcell of Christ Church in Oxford). He built it, and endowed it with good possessions, appropriating vnto the same the parsonages of Pagham and Magfield. He graunted also vnto the Couent of Canterbury the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Monkton and Estrey. It is worthy remembrance likewise, that when a certaine Countesse of Kent after the Earle her husbands death had prosessed her selfe a Nunne, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Amongst many good déeds, he is blamed for selling vnto the Earle of Arundell the right which he had vnto sixe and twenty Déere yéerely out of certaine grounds of his. He had for them onely two hundred and forty markes. After he had béene Archbishop sixetéene yéeres, fower moneths and twelue daies, he died Aprill 26. 1366.

For being made Cardinal of Saint Sixtus by Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> the fift Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 21. 1368. he left his Archbishopricke and went to Rome, where shortly after he was made Bishop Cardinall of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neste by <hi>Gregory</hi> the eleuenth, and held diuers liuings in Commendam, as the Archdeaconry and Treasurership of Wels with other. He liued there in great estimation about eight yeeres, and died July 22. 1376. of the same disease his predecessor had done, <hi>viz.</hi> a palsy, wherewith he was sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly taken as he sate at dinner. He was buried first in the church of the Carthusians (whose house he had founded) at Auinion, but after thrée yéeres his bones (by his owne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment while he liued) were taken vp and buried a second time at Westminster in a goodly toombe of alabaster. It is scarce credible that is reported of his woonderfull bounty and liberality to that monastery, I meane Westminster. When he was first made Abbot, he bestowed all that he had gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together being monke and prior, in paying the debt of the house, which was to the valew of two thousand and two hundred markes: he discharged it euery whit, and diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther summes of money, also that particular monkes did owe; whom he tendered and cherished as his owne children, neuer taking any thing from them, but rather augmenting; their

He was alwaies brought vp at schoole, and being yet very yoong, was sent by his father beyond the seas to study the canon lawe; and hauing procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Doctor of that faculty, became houshold Chaplein vnto Pope <hi>Innocent:</hi> and one of the Judges or Auditors of his Kota. The said Pope by way of prouision thrust him first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Chancellorship of Salisbury, and then afterward, <hi>viz.</hi> the yéere 1364. into the Bishopricke of London. He receiued the bulles of his translation thence, June 6. 1375. Two sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods or conuocations were held in his time, at both which he preached in Latin very learnedly. Sixe yeeres one month and ten daies he gouerned the Sée of Canterbury laudably, and at last was most vnwoorthily slaine, or rather wickedly murthered by a company of villanous rebels.

They answered, they were to impart vnto him certaine matters greatly importing the state of the common wealth, which if he would vnderstand, he should spéedily resort vnto them.

This spéech of theirs (I know not by what tell-tales) was carried vnto the rebels who sware by and by they would haue off the heads of these cruell counsellers.

But these varlets were so egerly bent, as the very songs of the Syrens would nothing haue mooued them at all from their intended course. Séeing therefore nothing but death before his face, with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable words, forgiuing the executioner (that scarce euer requested him so to doo) with a very chéerefull countenance he knéeled downe and yéelded him selfe vnto their fury. Once he was stricken in the necke so weakely, as that notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, he knéeled still vpright, and putting his hand vp to the wound, he vsed these words, a ha, it is the hand of God. He had not remoued his hand from the place when a second stroke cut of his fingers ends, and felled him to the ground. With much adoo, hauing hacked and hewen his necke with eight blowes, they got off his head. This horrible murther was committed vpon Fryday June 14. 1381. all which day, and a part of the next, his body lay there headlesse, no man daring to offer it buriall: as for his head they nayled his hood vpon it, and so fixing it vpon a poale, set it on London bridge. Sir <hi>Robert Hales</hi> and a great many of others that day, tasted of the same cup the Archbishop had done. Thus ended this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prelate his daies, who though he were very wise, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, eloquent, liberall, mercifull, and for his age and place reuerend, yet might it not deliuer him from the rage of this beast with many heads the multitude, then which being once incensed, there is no brute beast more cruell, more outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, more vnreasonable. How this monstrous tumult was appeased at the last, and the Authors of the same punished, according to their demerites, the Chronicles at large declare.

               <p>SOone after the lamentable death of <hi>Simon Sudbury</hi> the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1381"/> monkes of Canterbury elected for their Archbishop <hi>William Courtney</hi> Bishop of London, and the Pope knowing nothing of their election, about the same time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed the Archbishopricke vpon him by way of prouision. He was the sonne of <hi>Hugh Courtney</hi> Earle of Deuonshire, in his youth studied the Canon Lawe, and had no sooner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into orders, but he was quickly loaded with spirituall liuing ynough, as a prebend in Wels, an other in Exceter, &amp; a third in Yorke, beside benefices with cure innow. The yeere 1369. he was consecrate Bishop of Hereford, sate there flue yéers &amp; a halfe, and then remooued to London, at what tune <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sudbury</hi> was made Archbishop. <hi>Thomas Walsingham</hi> addeth to these former honours, that the yéere 1378. he was made Cardinall. I find no mention of it elsewhere, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doubt much of it. The bulles of his translation to Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury were published in Christchurch there Ianuary 9. 1381. Hauing then receiued his temporalties of the King, and done his homage, he went to Lambhith. Thither came vnto him a monke sent from the Couent and Prior of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury to deliuer him his crosse, which he did in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Lambhith vsing these words, Reuerend father, I am the messenger of the great King that doth require and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund you to take on you the gouernment of his Church, to loue and defend the same. In token whereof, I deliuer you this his ensigne. Soone after he receiued his pall; and then being throughly setled, began his Metropoliticall visitation which he entended to performe in euery Dioces of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince. Hauing passed quietly through Rochester, Chichester, Bathe, and Worceter; at Exceter he found some resistance as well as <hi>Simon Mepham</hi> his predecessor had done. After the time of his first inhibition, he prorogued diuers times the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3306:59"/>
day of his visitation, and when he had sate, was not so ha sty in graunting a relaxation of the inhibition as they would haue him. Hereby it came to passe that the Bishop and his Archdeacons were suspended from their iurisdiction longer (as it seemed vnto them) then they ought, and not disposed to await the Archbishops pleasure any longer, rushed into their iurisdictions againe, his visitation nothing neere finished, commaunding all men vpon paine of excommunication to repaire vnto their woonted ordinaries for proofe of wils, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations, institutions, or any other such like occasions. This commaundement published in many places of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oces, the Archbishop pronounced to be void and required all men in these and the like cases to repaire vnto him and none other. Hereupon the Bishop appealed to Rome, and the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop cited diuers of the Bishops officers to appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. His apparator (named <hi>Peter Hill</hi>) had also in his bosome a citation for the Bishop himselfe. It hapened that some of the Bishops followers, méeting this gentle soumer at Tapsham, beate him wel and thriftily and after forced him to eate the citation war paper and all. This fact was very preiudiciall to the Bishop of Exceters cause: For it incensed the king against him; in so much as though a while he did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute his aupcale at Rome diligently, he sawe himselfe so ouerborne by the king, he was like to doo no good at all, and therefore resolued to make his peace with the Archbishop vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reasonable conditions, which he easily obtained. But they that had abused his Apparator, were put to terrible penance, in diuers parts of the realme, and were faine to performe the same. One <hi>William Byd</hi> a Doctor of the Arches had giuen counsell vnto the Bishop in this cause: For so dooing he was displaced, and vpon that occasion an othe was ordained of this Archbishop, that euery Aduocate of that Court should take at his admission. This visitation ended, the Archbishop proceeded to the Dioces of Salisbury, where he likewise found some resistance. The Bishop there had procured apri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge from Pope Boniface <hi>(Vrban</hi> the 6. being lately dead) that it should not be lawfull for any Metropolitane to visite him or his Dioces by vertue of any authority granted from Pope <hi>Vrbane.</hi> The Archbishop (that was a great Lawyer)

he was inthronised at Canterbury with great pomp. He was sonne vnto <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of Arundell and Warren, first Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Ely, then of Yorke. Sée more of him there. He was scarce warme in his seate when by the kings displeasure he was dispossessed of the same. In the second yéere of his tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation a parliament was held at London. The king there accused the Duke of Glocester, the Earle of Arundell that was the Archbishops brother, and diuers other of high trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Now because cleargy men were forbidden by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons to be present at any triall or iudgement vpon life and death; the matter being once proposed, all the Bishops de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted the house as their maner was in like cases. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop being absent vpon this occasion, was condemned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with his brother of high treason; for which his brother was presently executed, and he commaunded within forty daies to depart the realme vpon paine of death. He (thus banished) got him to Rome and found such fauour with the Pope, as first he was content to write earnestly vnto the king for his restitution; and when he could do no good that way, he translated him to the Archbishopricke of Saint An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes in Scotland, intending to heape so much ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call liuing vpon him by benefices, &amp;c. in England, as he should be able to liue in state honorable ynough. The king vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of his intent, writ a maruellous sharpe letter vnto the Pope, telling him plainly he must repute him for his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, if he yéelded any maner of succour vnto him, whom he knew too well to hate him deadly. That letter so wrought with the Pope, as after that time he neuer indeuoured to prefer him farther, and moreouer, at the kings request made <hi>Roger Walden</hi> (Deane of Yorke, and treasurer of England) Archbishop. He was consecrate, inthronised, &amp;c. held Synods and did all things belonging vnto that place the space of two yéeres. It hapened in the meane time, that the king <hi>(Richard</hi> the second) wos deposed, or at least inforced to resigne his crowne vnto <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of Lancaster, that after possessed the same by the name of king <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth. <hi>Boniface</hi> the Pope vnderstanding then of the fall of king <hi>Richard,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the said <hi>Roger</hi> to be an intruder and vsurper of the Archbishopricke, and by his omnipotent bulles restored <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:3306:61"/>
Arundell</hi> vnto the same againe. As for <hi>Roger Walden</hi> that was now a Bishop without a Bishopricke (for it is <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter indelebilis</hi>) he liued so a while, til at last by the kind en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuor of the Archb. his charitable aduersary, he was promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the Bishopricke of London, which he enioyed but a short time, being taken away by death within one yere after. About a twelue moneth after the Archbishops restitution, a conuocation was held at London, whether the king sent the Earles of Northumberland and Westmerland, that told the cleargy they came from the king, but not of that errand that courtiers were woont to be sent for to that place; they came not for money, but onely to signifie the kings harty and fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable goodwill vnto them, and to request their daily prayers for him and the good estate of the realme. This new broome with swéeping so cleane at the first, was so worne out vnto the stumpes, in a yéere or two, as not contented with a bare tenth, the next conuocation after, he was very angry that a more liberall allowance was not made vnto him; and began to hearken vnto the sacrilegious motions of certaine impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous politicians, that intending to cast the burthen of all subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and other kind of tributes vpon the cleargy, letted not to say openly in the parliament house, how the laity was not able to yéeld any thing vnto the kings coffers, for that the cleargy had all the wealth of the land in their hands: And therefore the king must either take from them their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralties, or else lay all the burthen vpon them that onely were able to beare it. The Archbishop (that was vndoubtedly a woorthy prelate, wise and very stout) rose vp and prooued by manifest arguments that the contributions of the Cleargy were after the proportion of their ability, much more liberall then the subsidies or other paiments of the temporalty in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny respects. For (saith he) we pay the tenth of our liuings of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener then they pay fifteenths, and though we serue not in the warres our selues, our seruants and tenants do; neither are we altogither idle, in as much as we pray daily for the king and the realme, as well in time of peace as war. The prolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor of the parliament house at that time was a knight cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Sir <hi>Iohn Cleyn,</hi> that hauing béene a cleargyman some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, without any dispensation forsooke the calling &amp; became
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:3306:61"/>
a soldier. This prophane Apostata was not ashamed to say, it was no matter for their praiers, so the king might haue their mony. I sée now (quoth the Arch.) whither the fortune of this realme tendeth, the prayers of the church being despised, which should appease the wrath of God iustly kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs by the daily monstrous iniquities of our age. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing then that the king (who at his first comming to the crowne had made many open and publike protestations of his loue to the church, and his intent to defend and protect the same to the vtmost) that he I say began to harken somewhat too patiently to these wicked motions; he turned him toward him, and making lowe obeisance, humbly besought him, it would please his maiesty to remember those gratious and most honorable spéeches, wherein he had often signified his resolute determination of protecting the church from all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury, as also his othe taken to the same purpose at the time of his coronation, the danger and dishonour of breaking the same, and lastly, that he should feare to offend him by whom kings raigne, and before whose tribunall all princes and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs neuer so great must one day come to be iudged. The king seemed to be somewhat mooued with these words, and desiring the Archbishop to take his place againe, well (quoth he) howsoeuer I doe otherwise I will leaue the church in as good estate as I found it. The Archbishop then turning him about vnto the proloquutor and certaine other knights of the lower house that accompanied him: You it was (faith he and such as you are) that perswaded the last king to take into his hands all such celles in England as appertained vnto any religious houses of Fraunce or Normandy, assuring him it would so stuffe his coffers, as he could not want in many yéeres after, and there is no question, but the land belonging to such celles was woorth an infinite summe of mony: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it is certaine and well inough knowne, that within one yéere after he had taken that course, he was not the value of halfe a marke the richer; and how he thriued afterwarde otherwise, I néede not tell you. After that time there were no other attempts against the church in his daies. But the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy were so terrified with that wauering doubtfulnesse of the king, as they durst not but grant him a tenth euery yéere af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:3306:62"/>
and though there were no other occasion, the Archbishop was faine to call a conuocation euen for that purpose. His end (being as some report it) was very miserable: his tongue swelled so big in his mouth, as he was able neither to eate, drinke, nor speake in many dayes before his death, and died at last of hunger about the end of Ianuary 1413. when he had sate one moneth aboue 17. yéeres. He lyeth buried on the North side of the body of Christchurch in Canterbury, at the West end whereof toward the North, he built a faire spire stéeple called to this day by the name of <hi>Arundell</hi> steeple, and bestowed a goodly ring of fiue belles vpon the same; the first of them, he dedicated to the holy trinity, the second to the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed virgin the third to the Angel <hi>Gabriell,</hi> the fourth to Saint Blase, and the fift to Saint Iohn the Euangelist.</p>

               <p>AFter the death of <hi>Thomas Arundell, Henry Chichley</hi> Bishop of Saint Dauids was elected by the Couent of Canterbury to succéeds him. Now though many Lawes had béene made against the Popes vsurped authority <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1414"/> in bestowing Ecclesiasticall preferments by way of prouist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Yet durst not this man consent vnto this election so made, but committed the matter vnto the Popes determination, who first pronounced the election of the monkes void and then bestowed the Archbishopricke vpon him. This <hi>Henry Chichley</hi> was borne at Highamferrys in Northamptonshire brought vp in New Colledge in Oxford (where he procéeded Doctor of Law) and first preferred vnto the Chauncellorship of Salisbury. Hauing beene imployed much in Embassages and other businesses of the king (wherein he euer behaued himselfe wisely and to the kings great good liking) by his meanes he was made first Bishop of Saint Dauids and then Archbishop. He receiued his pall at the hands of the Bishop of Winchester, the 29. of July, 1414. and bought of the king the fruites of the vacacy (which was halfe a yéere) for sixe hundred markes. The yéere 1428. he was made Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of Saint <hi>Eusebius</hi> &amp; the Popes Legate, but refused to exercise his power Legatiue further then he was authorised thereunto by the king. He was a man happy (enioying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies

In the towne of Nigham ferrys where he was borne, he founded a goodly college for secular priests, which he endowed with large reuenues.

He bestowed much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in repairing the library at Canterbury, and then repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the same with a number of goodly bookes: He gaue vnto his Church many rich ornaments and iewels of great price, and built a great part of the Tower called Oxford Tower in the said Church. <hi>William Molash</hi> Prior there (that I may take any occasion to record so good a déede) the yéere 1430. furnished that Tower with a goodly bell called to this day Bell Dunstan.

A while he practised in the Arches, euen vntill <hi>Henry Chich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> the Archbishoppe made him his vicar generall there. By his fauour also he obtayned the Deanry of Saint Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins in London, and the prebend of Milton in the church of Lincoln.

This renowmed king being taken away by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely death, though he found not his passage so cléere, yet he still went forward in the way of preferment, and obtained of Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the fifth, the Bishopricke of Bathe and Wels the yéere 1425. Eightéene yéere he continued in that Sée, and August 23. 1443. was remooued to Canterbury.

Dec. 28. 1439. he was made Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of Saint Balbine, and afterwards being Archbishop of Canterbury was remooued to the title of S. Kusine.

By reason of his practise there, the Archbishop his predecessor <hi>(Thomas Bourchier)</hi> got knowledge of his manifold good parts, his great learning in the law, his wisedome, discretion and other vertues, which he not onely rewarded by preferring him to much good spirituall liuing, but also commended him vnto the king, who made him of his priuy Counsell.

The innocency of the man would not suffer him to lie there long: Not being able to stampe vpon him any probality of such matter as he

laid to his charge, he tooke him thence &amp; deliuered him to the kéeping of the Duke of Buckingham, who at that time lay for the most part at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> castle of Brecknock in Wales. This Duke was the onely instrument of displacing the children of king <hi>Edward</hi> from the crowne, and procured the same to be most vniustly set vpon the head of their wicked vncle the Duke of Yorke before mentioned, who was appointed Protectour of them &amp; the realme. These lambs committed vnto the kéeping of such a woolfe, were soone deuoured, being not onely despoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of the rule and gouernment of the kingdome which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended vnto them by inheritance, but of their liues <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were the detestation of this abhominable murther (which the duke of Buckingham pretended) or the vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of the tyrant, in not gratifying him according to his expectation, (which is the opinion of most men) or the enuie of his so great aduancement, whereof he thought himselfe better woorthy (which also is likely enough) certaine it is that he quickly began to grow malcontent, and being egged on by the Bishop his ghest, entred at last into a conspiracie against him, plotted the remoouing of him, and endeuoured to match the Earle of Richmond heire of the house of Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster with the eldest daughter of king <hi>Edward</hi> that (her bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren being made away) was now out of all question heire of the house of Yorke, so to throwe downe headlong the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the throwne which he vsurped, to restore it to them to whom of right it appertained, and to ioyne in one these two noble houses, whose contention had wasted away al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all the nobility of the land. How this deuice was deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted betwéene the Duke and the Bishop, euery Chronicle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth. To let that passe, when the Bishop sawe the Duke had waded so farre in the matter as step backe he could not, and séeing how he was able to do the Earle of Richmond bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter seruice elsewhere then where he was, he found a meanes to slip away in a night disguised; neuer making his host the Duke acquainted with his departure.

In the meane time king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight that fauored him much (as being néere of kinne vnto him both by father and mother) before his departure had bestowed vpon him the Deanry of Exceter. He had béene in Italy (lying for the most part at Padua) the space of 7. yéeres, at what time the king hauing abolished the Popes authority, sent for him home, &amp; he not comming, proclaimed him Traytor, and gaue away his Deanry vnto another. This losse he estéemed little of. <hi>Petrus Bembus</hi> an old acquaintance of his was become the Popes chiefe secretary, who so commended him vnto his master, that shortly after he was content to make him a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall, perswading himselfe belike that he would prooue a good instrument for English matters as occasion should serue. And surely if he regarded the woorthinesse of the man, in respect of his manifold rare and excellent partes, he could not lightly preferre any man lesse obnoxious to exceptions. For he was not onely very learned (which is better kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen then that itnéedeth many wordes) but also of such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:3306:69"/>
in outward behauiour and integrity of life and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, as he was of all men both loued and reuerenced. I know well that <hi>Pasquill</hi> played his parts with him, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered a brat or two vpon him, but without any probability at all. He was made Cardinall Maye 22. 1536. The Pope employed him then in diuers Embassages vnto the Emperor and the French King, wherein he did his best endeuour to ioine them against his owne soueraigne the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and not content therewith, he dealt so busily with his letters amongst his friends in England, wherein he dehor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them from the Kings obedience, and all conformity vnto reformation, as it turned many of them to great trouble, and amongst the rest, cost his mother her head. It pleased not God that any of his platformes should take successe: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore partly malcontent, and partly also weary of the paines and continuall danger these Embassages forced him vnto, he procured the Pope to make him Legate of Uiterbio, where he determined to leade the rest of his life quietly; But he was disappointed of his purpose. The Pope <hi>(Paul 3.)</hi> sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned a Councell at Trent. Cardinall <hi>Poole</hi> and one or two other ioyned with him, must néedes be his Uicegerents there.

At last (but a day after the faire) ouer came this iolly legate, reconciled the realme of England to the Pope, caused the Archbishop of Canterbury to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and degraded, seating himselfe in his Sée, which things and many more are discoursed of him at large by Master <hi>Foxe,</hi> and therefore I passe them ouer. He was consecrate March 22. 1555. in the gray Friers church at Gréenwich. The Lady day following he receiued his pal in Bow church, where he made a dry and friuolous sermon touching the vse, profit, signification, and first institution of the pall. March 31. he was installed by a proctor one <hi>Robert Collins</hi> his commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary. While these things were a dooing, Cardinall <hi>Caraffa</hi> his ancient enimy became Pope. He presently discharged our Cardinall of his power legantine, and made one Frier <hi>Peto first</hi> a Cardinall, then his legate, and bestowed the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke of Salisbury vpon him. He alleaged against Cardinall <hi>Poole</hi> that he was vnwoorthy the honour of the legate Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall that would suffer the Quéene to proclaime warres against the French king; but the matter was, the old quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels were not yet digested, &amp; this way he thought to pay him home. The Quéene kept Frier <hi>Peto</hi> out of the realme by force, vntill the Pope was reconciled vnto Cardinall <hi>Poole</hi> againe. Two yéere and almost 8. months this man continued Archb. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yere 1558. many old me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fel into quartaine agues (a disease fatall vnto elderly folke.) Amongst the rest, a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane had seased vpon him, and brought him to a low ebbe, at what time newes being brought of Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> death, strucke him quite dead. For he departed this life euen the same day that she did, viz. Nouember 17. 1558. being 58. yéeres of age, and sixe moneths. He procured in his life time, the gift and patronage of 19. benefices from the Quéene vnto his Sée, which he no way else benefited, except by the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a certaine gallery toward the East at Lambhith, and some few roomes adioyning.

His goods he left to the disposition of one <hi>Aloysius Priolus</hi> an Italian, who bestowed them all to good vses, reseruing nothing vnto him selfe, but two praier bookes.

not onely withstood him openly, but cryed out vpon the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable and shamelesse couetousnes of the court of Rome, and was the onely meanes of staying the course of that exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For reuenge hereof not long after they began to frame an accusation against him at Rome, alleaging matters alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither false and friuolous. It forced him to trauell thither, and cost him great summes of money before he could rid his hands of that brabble. The yéere 1233. <hi>Walter Mauclerke</hi> Bishop of Carlile taking ship to passe ouer the seas, was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by some of the kings officers, for that he had no licence to depart the realme.

They to whom the businesse was committed, finding him vpon his knées before the high altar with the sacrament in one hand and a crosse in the other, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him away neuertheles vnto the Tower of London. The Bishop taking this to be a great violence and wrong offered vnto holy church, would neuer leaue the king (that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déed a Prince religious ynough) vntill he had caused the Earle to be caried vnto the place whence he was taken. It is thought it was a meanes of sauing the Earles life. For though order was taken he should not scape thence, yet it gaue the kings wrath a time to coole, and himselfe leysure to make proofe of his innocency: By reason whereof, he was afterward restored to the kings fauour and former places of honour.

quickly his liberty and kingdome. In the meane time the Empresse being iealous of the Bishop, came sodainly to Winchester; and the Bishop doubting her comming to be to no other end but to surprise him, went out at one gate as she entred at another. Within a fewe daies hauing gotten force about him, he returned to Winchester in an vnhappy houre. For (whether by his direction or no, it is not certaine; but by his company out of all question) the city was fired, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part thereof being burnt downe to the ground, togither with the Nunnery, the Monastery of Saint Grimbald, and more then 20. other Churches, (some say 40.)

But it was destroied by the Danes, and quite ruinated, til this Bishop reedified it, or rather laide new foundations in the same place, ann. 1132. and endowed it with the reuenew it now hath. He also built the castell of Farnham, destroied afterward by king <hi>Henry</hi> the 3. but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edified by the Bishops of Winch. He was a man as of great bloud, so of a great and high minde.

He had at that time other spirituall liuing equiualent in reuenue to the Archbishopricke of Canterbury, which that he might kéepe and yet receiue all the profits of the Bishopricke of Winchester; he determined not to be consecrate at all, but to hold it by his election, and so did indéed, for the space of 9. yéeres. In the meane time, he and the rest of his countreymen (with whom the realme was much pestered) were growen very odious as well with the nobility, as the commons, not onely for that their infinite wealth and immoderate prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was much enuied, but much more for their pride, and insolency which a man can hardly beare in his owne friend, much lesse in an alien and stranger, whom men naturally dislike much sooner then their owne Countreymen.

               <p>AT the Kings request, <hi>William Wickham,</hi> his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, principall Secretary, and kéeper of the priuy seale, soone after <hi>Edendons</hi> death was both elected by the Prior and couent of Winchester, and allowed of by the Pope who now tooke vpon him to haue an interest in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of all our Bishoprickes, as elsewhere I haue more at large discoursed. This man was the sonne of one <hi>Iohn Perot</hi> and <hi>Sibill</hi> his wife, for whose place of buriall, he erected a Chappell afterwards at Tichfield néere the towne of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham in Hampshire. In that towne he was borne the yéere of our Lord 1324. and (according to the manner of most clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy men in those times) of that towne the place of his birth tooke his sirname. I finde also recorded, that he was woont to be called sometimes by the name of <hi>Long,</hi> and that (as it is probably supposed) for no other cause, but in regard of his stature, which they say was very tall. He was brought vp first at Winchester, and then at Oxford, at the charge of a Gentleman called <hi>Nicholas Vnedall or Woodall.</hi> In these places (hauing first passed the rudiments of Grammer) he
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:3306:98"/>
studied Logicke, Geometry, Arithmetique, and the French tongue, but principally the Ciuill and Canon lawes. In all which as he profited excéedingly for the time he spent in them; so there is no doubt he would haue prooued so excellent as men are woont that doo long and painefully imploy good wits to such purposes, had he not béene euen as it were violently drawne from them when his abode and continuance in the Uniuersity might séeme most requisite. His Patrone and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitioner being appointed Constable of Winchester Castle, (an office of great importance in those daies) he would imploy this his yoong scholler as his clarke or secretary, and so tooke him from the Uniuersity when he had as yet continued there not fully sixe yéeres. How long he liued so vnder him I finde not: But certaine it is, his seruice was very well liked of him: For besides his personage (which was tall and excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding comely) not to speake any thing of his learning (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of his Master could make no great vse) he writ very faire, penned excellently, &amp; spake no man better. By reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he was often imployed in writing letters, yea and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in messages also to the Court, not onely by his master, but by the Bishop, that a while vsed to borrow him of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and at the last drew him to his seruice. It happened then after a while, king <hi>Edward</hi> the third to come to Winchester, who taking speciall note of the behauiour &amp; other good partes of this yoong man, would néedes haue him to serue him. He imployed him much at the first, in surueighing his buildings at Douer, Duynborough, Henly, Windsor, Yestanstead, and elsewhere. In which &amp; all other businesses committed to him, he behaued himselfe so well, as he soone grew into great fauour and high estimation with the king, and quickly reaped those fruites that Princes fauours are woont to yéeld, many rich and honorable preferments. It shall not be amisse to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, how that hauing obtained diuers goodly promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which he acknowledged to haue receiued rather as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of seruice, then in regard of any extraordinary desert otherwise, he caused to be engrauen in Winchester Tower at Windsor these words, <hi>(This made Wickham.)</hi> Whereof when some complained to the King as a thing derogating from his honor, that another should seeme to beare the charge
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:3306:99"/>
of his buildings, and the king in great displeasure reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him for it: He answered, that his meaning was not to ascribe the honor of that building to himselfe, but his owne honor of preferments vnto that building; Not importing that <hi>Wickham</hi> made the Tower, but that the Tower was the meanes of making <hi>Wickham,</hi> and raising him from base estate, vnto those great places of honor he then enioyed. He was first Parson of Saint Martins in London, then Deane of Saint <hi>Martin le graund,</hi> Archdeacon successiuely of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colne, Northampton, and Buckingham, all of the gift of his old acquaintance <hi>Iohn Bokingham</hi> Bishop of Lincolne, with whom &amp; <hi>Simon Burleigh</hi> (a knight afterwards of great honor) he onely in a manner conuersed during his abode in Oxford. Besides these ecclesiasticall preferments, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uostship of Wels, a number of benefices, and twelue Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bends in seuerall Churches, he held many temporall offices, as the Secretaryship, the kéeping of the priuy seale, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stership of wardes, the treasurership of the Kings reuenues in Fraunce, and diuers other with whose stiles I am not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted.

He was consecrate Bishop of Winchester, the yéere 1367. and was made soone after first treasurer, then Chauncellor of England, (although whether he were treasurer or no I find some doubt made, and I dare not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

In this greatnesse of his authority, the king found two notable commodities, one, that without his care all thinges were ordred so well, as by a wise and trusty seruant they might; the other, that if any thing fell out amisse, wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the fault were, the king had oportunity to cast all the blame vpon the Bishop of Winchester. Now whereas long and continuall warre (whereby lightly each party is a looser) had consumed, not that onely that many victories brought in, by the raunsome of two kings, and by the spoyle of diuers large countries which this noble Prince subdued; but other

huge summes of money also gathered at home by vnusuall subsidies, and taxations much grudged at by the commons; all which notwithstanding, the king was so bare, as, for the paiment of debts, he was constrained to bethinke him first of some new deuice to raise money: The Bishops enimies ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the aduantage of this occasion; induced the king to be content that a solemne complaint might be framed against him, as if by his misgouernement, the kings treasure had beene either vainely wasted, or falsely imbesilled, for that otherwise for sooth it was impossible the king should so be fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len behind hand: They charge him therefore with the receite of 1109600. <abbr>l</abbr>. (which amounteth to more then a million of poundes) besides a hundred thousand frankes paied vnto him by <hi>Galeace</hi> Duke of Millaine. For all this they demaund sodainely an account, and to set a better colour vpon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, patch vp a number of other accusations, partly vntrue, partly friuolous, yet sufficient happily to bleare the eies of the common people, and diuerting the displeasure of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience from them on whom otherwise it must haue lighted, to deriue it vnto him, vpon whom if it fell neuer so heauily, it could cast him no lower then that place fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence the king had first raised him.

By this meanes, licence was obtained for his repaire thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and thither he came, glad he might be néere to the meanes of his restitution: but whether it were that he wanted money to beare the charge, or to the intent to mooue commiseration, or that he thought it safest to passe obscure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; he that was woont to ride with the greatest traine of any Prelate in England, came then very slenderly attended, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling through by-waies, as standing in doubt what snares his enimies might lay for him. After two yéeres trouble and the losse of ten thousand markes sustained by reason of the same: with much adoo he obtained restitution of his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralties, by the mediation of <hi>Alice Piers,</hi> a gentlewoman that in the last times of king <hi>Edward</hi> altogether possessed him. Returning then vnto Winchester, he was receiued into the city with solemne procession and many signes of great ioy. Soone after his returne king <hi>Edward</hi> died, and the Duke ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping by reason of the yoong kings nonage to worke some mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe vnto this Bishop, whom of all mortall men he most hated; began to rub vp some of the old accusations with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of new complaints. But the Dukes malice being as well knowen as the Bishops innocency, the king thought good to be a meanes of reconciling these two personages, and then was easily intreated, vnder the broad seale of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to pardon all those supposed offences, wherewith the Bishop had heretofore béene charged. This tempest thus ouerblowen, the rest of his daies he passed in great peace and quietnesse. Two yéeres after his restitution he began the foundation of that woorthy monument, the colledge common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the New colledge in Oxford, laying the first stone of the same himselfe March 5. 1379. and dedicating it vnto the honor of God and the blessed virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> Being finished, the first warden &amp; fellowes all together tooke possession of it Aprill 14. 1386. at thrée of the clocke in the morning.

Beside the charge of these two woorthy foundations, he build all the body of his church of Winchester from the quier westward, excepting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a little begun by Bishop Edington: he procured many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges and liberties vnto his Sée: he bestowed 20000. markes in reparation of his house: he paid the debts of men imprisoned for that cause to the summe of 2000. <abbr>l</abbr>. he mended all the high waies betwéene London and Winchester: he purchased vnto his Sée two hundred markes land: he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaue his officers two thousand markes which they owed him: he bestowed two hundred pound vpon the church of Windsor: he released his tenants of 520. <abbr>l</abbr>. due for a reliefe at his incomme: he ordayned a Chauntry of fiue priests at Southwyke: he kept continually in his house fower &amp; twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty poore almesmen: he maintained at the Uniuersity fifty schollers for the space of seuen yéeres before the building of his colledge: he built a chappell (as before is mentioned) at Tichfield for the buriall of his parents; &amp; lastly prouided for himselfe ten yéeres before his death a goodly monument in the body of his church.

                  <hi>Magistratus indicat virum,</hi> the man that in base fortune séemed to all men not onely wise, but vertuous and humble ynough; being raised vnto this height of power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as being either drunken and infatuate with too much and sodaine prosperity, or amased with the brightnesse of his owne good fortune, began presently to do many things, not onely vntowardly, and vndiscréetly, but very arrogantly and insolently, sauouring aswell of vnconscionable couetousnesse and cruelty, as lacke of wisedome and policy in so great a gouernor requisite. That which in our histories is most bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and most odiously mentioned, I finde no such great fault withall, that calling a conuoctiou by vertue of his power Legantine; at the suggestion and intreaty of <hi>Hugh Nouaunt</hi> Bishop of Chester, he displaced the monkes of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentrée, &amp; put in secular Priests in their roomes.

These excuses satisfied

               <p>TWo yéeres after the departure of Walter to Koan, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1186"/> Sée of Lincolne continued void. Upon Saint <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewes</hi> day 1186. one Hugh the first Prior of the Charterhouse monkes at Witteham in Somersetshire was consecrate Bishop of the said Church. This Hugh (who by his integrity of life and conuersation, and the opinion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers myracles wrought by him, hath purchased vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the honour and reputation of a Saint) was borne in a City of Burgundy, called Gratianopolis. By the aduise and direction of his Father, (who hauing buried his wife, had made himselfe a regular Channon) he also entred the same profession being yet very yoong: But waring elder, he betooke him selfe afterwards vnto the straight and seuere orders of the Carthusians or Charterhouse monkes (as we commonly call them.) In that kind of life he not only obserued all things requisite by the rule of their order, but so farre surmounted the same in performing much more then it required, as he grew very famous farre and néere for his extraordinary ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence and austerity of life. It chaunced the report thereof to come vnto the eares of king <hi>Henry</hi> the second: who buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a house for Carthusian monkes at Witteham aboue mentioned, thought good to send <hi>Reginald</hi> Bishop of Bathe into Burgundy, to intreate this holy man, to accept the place of the Prior of this new foundation. With much adoo he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, and came ouer with the Bishop. The king (who for the opinion he had of his holinesse, vsed often priuately to conferre with him) remembring how great wrong he had done the Church of Lincolne in so long kéeping it without a Bishop, determined to make amends by giuing them a good
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:3306:127"/>
one at last, and procured this Hugh before he vnderstood of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such thing toward, to be elected Bishop of that Sée. He gouerned very stoutly and with great seuerity, yet so, as he was more reuerenced and loued then feared. His excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications were very terrible vnto all men, and the rather, for that it was noted (as I find deliuered) some notable calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty otherwise did lightly follow them. His Church of Lincolne he caused to be all new built from the foundation, a great and memorable worke, and not possible to be performed by him without infinite helpe. Moreouer, he gaue vnto the King 1000. markes, to acquite him and his successors, from the yeerely payment of a Mantell of Sables, wherewith by an auncient custome they were woont euery newyeares tide to present him. The yeere 1200. he would néedes make a voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to Carthusia the chiefe and originall house of their order. In his returne home, he fell sicke of a quartane ague at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and there died, Nouember. 17. 1200. His body was presently conueighed to Lincolne, &amp; hapened to be brought thither, at a time, when king <hi>Iohn</hi> of England and <hi>William</hi> king of Scots were mette there, with an infinite number of the nobility of both realmes. The two kings, for the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence they bare vnto his holynesse, would needes set their shoulders vnto the beere, and helped to cary his coarse from the gates of the City, vntill it came to the Church doore: There it was receiued by the Prelates, caried into the quire and the funer all rites being ended, buried in the body of the East part of the Church aboue the high Aulter, neere the aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist.

This Bishop obtained of the same king much good land and many notable priuileges for his church. He made biuers statutes, and amongst other things, he ordained, that all his Canons or Prebendaries should lodge in one chamber, and take their diet at one table. He appointed them likewise a steward that should prouide them victualls daily, and once in the yéere deliuered them new clothes. This kinde of gouernment (saith <hi>William Malmes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury)</hi> he learned in Lorraine, and it is (saith he) continued by the posterity, although by the corruption and luxury of our time somewhat altered and decaied. After that he had well and woorthily ruled his church and Diocesse, by the space of thrée and twenty yéeres, he ended his daies in peace Anno 1073. and was buried in the Cemitory or churchyard of his owne church vnder a simple and a broken marble stone,

Chapter and Quier in their ornaments, with Te Deum, and so caried into the church. The vsuall Ceremonies being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed there, at his pallace a great feast was prepared, for the entertainement of such noblemen and other parsonages of account as repaired hither at that time. It is incredible how many oxen, tunnes of Ale, and Wine, are said to haue béene vsually spent at this kind of solemnity. Euen so much, as the whole yéerely reuenue at this time would not suffice to pay for. This Bishop was greatly in fauour with king <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the second, who made him first of his priuy Councell, then Lord Treasurer of England, and imploied him in diuers Embassages of great importance. The yéere 1329. he was sent Embassadour to the French king, and ioyned in commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion with the Quéene, for the conclusion of a peace betweene these two princes. That being ordered and brought to passe according to his desire, he returned home, leauing the Quéene with the French king her brother, to perfect and finish the agréement already made. She whether weary of her hust and, or prouoked by the insolency of the Spencers and other fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites about the king; had long since determined to depose her husband from the kingdome, if possibly she might; and to set vp her sonne Prince <hi>Edward.</hi> Hauing therefore rid away this Bishop, whose loialty and faithfullnesse to his soueraigne she well knew was vnmooueable; she began to put in practise the execution of this long plotted designement, and in the end (to be short) exploited the same. While these matters were a brewing, it happened the king to take his iourney to Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow; and he thought good to commit the gouernment and custody of the citie of London to the fidelity of this Bishop. At what time therefore the Quéene began to approach néere vnto the city with her power, he required the Maior to send vnto him the keies of the gates. The Commons (who altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fauoured the Quéenes party) hearing this, and percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Bishop purposed to withstand her; set vpon him vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, drew him into Cheape side, and beheaded him there, together with Sir <hi>Richard Stapleton</hi> a Knight his brother. Then they caried his body to his house without Temple bar, and buried if basely in a heape of sand, in the backside of the same house. In this sort did this woorthy prelate loose his life,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:3306:174"/>
in defence of his Prince, and that by their meanes, who of all other were bound in the strongest bands of duty and allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to haue done as he did, I meane the Queene and the Prince her sonne. They shortly after, whether regarding his calling, or destring to make semblance of disliking the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his death, or happily mooued with some remorse of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, commanded his body to be taken from the place where it was first <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

This murther was committed October 15 1326. And his funerals were solemnised at Exceter March 28. following. The yéere 1316. he erected two houses in Oxford for the better increase and aduancement of learning; the one named Hart hall, the other Stapledons Inne, now called Exceter college; in which he placed thirteene fellowes, and a Rector, whom he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be chosen annually.

Neither could he euer be induced to forsake the said Archbishop, vntill he séemed to forsake his owne cause by flying the country.

The king (a wise and gentle Prince, Henry the first) whether not vouchsafing to contend with him, or taking his well meaning in good part, was not onely content to pardon this disobedience, but also bestowed the money so gathered in his Dioces vpon him, saying it was a poore Bishopricke, and néeded such helpes.

            <p>ABout the yéere of our Lord 730. there liued a Duke of Oxford called Didan. He had a daughter of excellent beauty named Frideswyde, who though she had many importunate suters, men of great wealthand nobility; yet desiring to serue God in such sort as she thought might be most acceptable vnto him, would néedes dedicate her selfe vnto a sole and Monasticall life. Amongst the rest of her wooers, there was one a yoong Gentleman of great power (some say he was a King) his name was Algarus. He not preuayling by intreaty, thought to vse force; and vpon a time, getting company about him, had almost seased vpon his desired pray; which he had so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly beset, as she had no way to escape his hands, but by flying into a wood. Thither also he followed her, and that so néere, as leauing it, she had much adoo to recouer Oxford. Perceiuing then that neither she was able to fly any further for wearinesse, nor yet to withstand him there; she called vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for assistance against this importunate louer, who thereupon (as the story saith) was miraculously stricken blind; And he continued in that case, till by her prayers he recouered his sight againe. Upon this occasion (saith Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Malmsbury and the rest of our Histories) the Kings of England tooke a conceite, that it was not safe for any Prince to enter Oxford, in so much, as euery one, being loath to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the tryall of it in himselfe, it was euer auoyded by them, till the time that King Henry the third prooued it altogether vaine by his owne experience. In this place, Didan, by the intreaty of his daughter, built a Monastery for Nunnes, and appointed her the Abbesse. It happened then obout the yéere of grace 847. in the time of King Egelred, that certaine Danes flying into this Monastery to saue their liues from the bloody cruelty of the English pursuing them; when other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

This oath it séemed vnto <hi>Aldred</hi> the king had broken, and therefore (like a couragious Prelate) he stucke not to thunder out an excommunication against him, saying that now worthily he had cursed, whom once vnworthily he had blessed. This bold pranke being reported vnto the king, incensed him very much at first, but thinking better of it, he determined to giue faire words a while, and so sent some to entreat for his absolution. These messengers came too late for the Bishop being troubled much in mind after the performance of that action, and either amased with feare of what might happen after it, or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with gréefe and repentance of that he had done; neuer could be mery after, and so by conceit was cast into a disease, whereof he died.

These were so great matters in the Popes iudgement, as <hi>Thomas</hi> must be depriued of his ring and crosier, and not restored to them but by the entreaty of <hi>Lanfranke.</hi> As for the matter of Primacy, he left it to the iudgment of the king and Bishops of England, who forced <hi>Thomas</hi> to yeeld. Comming then to Yorke, he found y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> estate of his whole Dioces (the city &amp; church especially) most miserable. The Danes before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned comming toward Yorke; the Normans that held the castle thought good to burne certaine houses neere the castle, least they might be a furtherance vnto the enemy. This vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentle fire would not be entreated to stay iust where they would haue it, but procéeding farther then his commission, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed the monastery and church of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and in fine the whole city. Before the fire was out, the Danes came and tooke both city and castle by force, putting to the sword all the Normans they found there (to the number of 3000) sauing none aliue, but one <hi>William Mallet,</hi> his wife, children, and a few other. Soone after the destruction of this goodly city, the king came into these parts with a puissant army against the Danes, not ceasing to make all manner of spoile as if he had béene in the enemies countrey. So betwéene the Danes and the Normans, such hauocke was made, as all the land from the great riuer of Humber vnto the riuer of Tine, lay waste, and not inhabited by any man for the space of nine yeeres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In the church of Yorke there were onely thrée Chanons left, the rest being all either dead or fled away: &amp; they had left vnto them neither house to put their heads in, nor any good meanes how to line and maintaine themselues. All these faults this industrious Bishop endeuoured to amend. First he new couered and repaired his church as well as he might
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:3306:235"/>
to serue the turne for a time. But afterwards he pulled downe all the old building, and erected from the very foundation a new, to wit, the Minster that now standeth. His channons dispersed abroad, he called home againe, and tooke order they should be reasonably prouided for. He built them a hall and a dorter, and appointed one of them to be the Prouost, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of the rest. Also he bestowed certaine mannors and lands vpon them, and caused other to be restored that had béen taken from them. The church then hauing continued in this state a good while, I know not by whose aduise, the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop thought good to diuide the land of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> church into Prebends, and so to allot a particular portion vnto eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry channon, whereas before they liued together vpon the common charges of the church at one table, much in like sort as fellowes of houses do now in the Uniuersities. At the same time also he appointed a Deane, a Treasurer, and a chanter; and also for the Chauncellorship it was founded of him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The church newly built by him he furnished with books, and all kind of ornaments necessary; but his speciall care was to furnish the same and the rest of his Dioces with lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and honest men, with whom he was woont continually to conferre and reason (sometime with one, and sometime with another) partly for his owne exercise, and partly to sée, what was in them, and to raise them vp to a diligence in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing their knowledge. Himselfe was very learned, and writ diuers things both in prose and verse.

Yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring himselfe at last, he went to Rome, to plead his cause before the Pope, and obtained letters to the king and Archbishop of Canterbury in commendation of his cause.

would be wonne by no meanes, and <hi>Thurstan</hi> continuing as obstinate in his resolution; The Sée remained void along time. At last, it fell out, that a Counsell was summoned to be held at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

So he (and he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I thinke of all the Archbishops of York since the Conquest) neuer made profession of subiection to the Metropoliticall See of Canterbury.

Neither could the Pope (méeting with the King at Gisors and intreating for him) so pacifie his displeasure, as that he would suffer him to returne. After fiue yeeres banishment, the Pope writ a very sharpe letter vnto the king, signifying, that he would excommunicate both him, and the Archbishop of Canterbury also, if <hi>Thurstan</hi> were any longer kept from his See and charge. Hereupon he was called home, and soone after reconciled vnto the King. This man is much praysed, first for his learning, then for his great wisedome and discretion, and lastly for his industry and diligence, his care and painefulnesse, in well gouerning the charge committed to him.

<pb n="462" facs="tcp:3306:240"/>
and his seisure to returne into the exchecquer, which was done accordingly: whereupon the said Archbishop ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, not onely the Sherisie that had done him this violence, but all those in generall that were the authors of the same, and that had béene any meanes to stirre vp the kings indignation against him. The cause of this trouble is diuersly reported: some say, that he hindered the kings offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in gathering a kind of taxe through his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; others, that he refused to saile into Norwandy with him, when he went to make a marriage for his neice, and to conclude a league with the French king. Whether one of these were the cause, or both, or none, I can not tell; But certaine it is, that one whole yéere his temporalities were detained from him, his mooueable goods neuer restored, and yet moreouer he was saine to pay a thousand pound sterling for his restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This was a greater wound then that it might easily be cured. Sixe or 7. yéeres after, it brake out againe, to wit, an. 1207.

After this, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were he were guilty of some greater attempt, or that he vnderstood, his brother to be gréeuously offended with him for withstanding, this his desire; well perceiuing England was too hote for him, secretly he auoyded the Realme, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating before his departure such of his iurisdiction, as either had paied the said taxe, or should hereafter pay it. He liued then in banishment 5. yéeres, euen vntill he was called to his long home by death, which was the yéere 1213. So he continued Archbishop somewhat more then 21. yéeres.</p>

If the old quarrell betwéene the Archbishop and him, stucke yet some thing in his stomacke, I maruell not: but he alledged that he thought it dangerous and very inconuenient the whole Church of England should be ruled by two brethren, one at Canterbury in the South, an other at Yorke in the North.

It was in the yéere 1253. at what time he being a very aged man and sickely, was excéeding loath to take it vpon him. He sate Archbishop aboue 39. yéeres, in which space he did many things to the good and benefit, both of his Sée and church. The mannor of Thorpe he purchased and the church of the same, both which he gaue vnto his Sée. He erected many Chauntries in diuers places. He gaue vnto his church 32. wonderful sumptuous coapes; and left a goodly stocke of cattle vnto his successors, procuring the king to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the gift, and to take order that euery Archbishop should be bound to leaue it as he found it.

Now the king not liking this spéede of the Chapter men, as not being for his profit, hindred the new elect what he might, and for want of better matter, alleaged against him, that he was a bastard, and so by the Cannons vncapeable of that honour. It was true enough, and how he salued that soare I cannot tell; A dispensation belike from Rome (where all things were then to be had for mony) tooke away that obstacle.

Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the streame still of this good fortune, and thinking it best to take his time, he procured the Pope to make him first his legate <hi>a Latere,</hi> and soone after (viz. the yeere 1515) Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. He handled the matter also in such sort with the king, as he was content to discharge the Archbishop of Canterbury from the office of Chauncellor and bestowed it vpon him. Then as though the Archbishopricke of Yorke and Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellorship of England were not sufficient for maintenance of a Cardinall, he tooke also vnto him the Bishopricke of Bathe the yéere 1518 holding it and the abbey of Saint Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bons with diuers other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Almost halfe a yéere he liued néere London in great penurie; one while at Asher (a house belonging to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke of Winchester) and an other while at Richmond; the which house, the king had lately giuen him in exchange for Hampton court.

to do him seruice, not regarding my seruice to God, but onely to satisfie his pleasure. In his flourishing time, he began the building of two most stately colledges, one at Ipswich, the other at Oxford; and it is great pittie he finished them not.

Being passing subtile and shrewd witted, faire spoken, and nothing scrupulous, but ready to do any thing for preferment; It was no hard matter for him to obtaiue any thing of the king (<hi>William Rufus)</hi> a very corrupt and vicious prince. His first practise was, to farme the vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Abbotships and Bishopricks of the king; whereby he not onely enriched himselfe, but brought great sommes of mony into the kings coffers that neuer were acquainted with that kinde of profite before. The king perceiuing him to be a fit instrument for his purposes, imploied him daily more and more, and at last made him chiefe gouernour of all his realme vnder him, so as he had all that authority which now the Lord Treasurer, Chauncellor, and diuers other officers haue

He sate Bishop a long time, almost 42. yéeres; in which time he built diuers houses vpon his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors out of the ground, and bestowed much in repairing of the rest. He builte a faire house at Derlington; He founded the Priory of Finchall; he bought Sadbury of king <hi>Richard</hi> the first, and gaue it vnto his Sée. He built the bridge of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet and the Galiley at the west end of his Cathedrall church, in which he placed the bones of venerable <hi>Beda.</hi> Lastly, he built two hospitals, one at Allerton, an other called Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne at the East end of Durham. To Sherburne he alotted liberall allowance for the maintenance of 65. poore Lasers, and a certaine number of priests. <hi>Neubrigenses</hi> ascribeth this good worke partly vnto other men, whom he enforced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come benefactors vnto this foundation, being loath to be at the whole charge himselfe. At what time king <hi>Richard</hi> made prouision for his iorney into the Holy land, he also tooke on him the crosse, and vowed to be one of that companie. The king vnderstanding that he had prepared a great masse of money to carry with him, perswaded him to stay at home, and to afford him his money; which if he would do, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to make him Earle of Northumberland. The Bishop long since repenting the vow he had made, quickly condiscen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to this offer, &amp; accepted the same. The king hauing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him an Earle, turned him about vnto the companie, and laughing, saide, he had performed a woonderfull exploit; for

(quoth he) of an old Bishop I haue made a yoong Earle. Now that he might haue some colourable ercuse of not performing his vow, he caused the king to alledge that he might not be spared out of the realme in his absence: And to make this the more probable, giuing the king 1000. markes, he perswaded him with golden Rhetoricke to make him chiefe Justice of England. The like Rhetoricke it was that induced the Pope to dispence with his vow, vnto which the excuses before allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged made some way, but could neuer haue effected the busines without that helpe. At the returne of K <hi>Richard</hi> from Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem; he found him not so fauourable as he expected, &amp; thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that he grudged him his Earledome, resigned the same into his hands.

This election the Archbishop of Yorke confirmed; yea the matter grew so forward, as the same Archbishop was content to giue him consecration also. All this while the kings good will was not sought, no nor (which was a greater ouersight as the world then went) the Popes neither. The king therefore not onely refused to deliuer possession of the temporalties vnto this elect, but also laboured the Pope, <hi>ex plenitudine potestatis</hi> to conferre the Bishopricke vpon a chaplaine of his named <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard de Bury,</hi> then Deane of Welles. Partly to pleasure the one that requested, partly to displeasure the other for not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questing, he did so, and commaunded the Bishop of Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to consecrate him, which being performed at Chertsey soone after Christmasse, the king presently inuested him in the temporalties belonging to that Sée. Now was the monke a Bishop without a Bishopricke. Hauing no other home, he was faine to returne to his cloyster, and therefor very griefe (as it is to be supposed) within a few daies after died. This <hi>Richard de Bury</hi> was borne at Saint Edmunds Bury in Suffolke, whence he tooke his surname; for he was the sonne of one Sir <hi>Richard Angaruill</hi> knight. His father died leauing him very yoong, and committed him vnto the tuition of <hi>Iohn Willoughby</hi> a priest, his vncle, who brought him vp care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and that for the most part in the Uniuersity of Oxford. From thence he was called to teach <hi>Edward</hi> of Windsor Prince of Wales. At what time the said Prince fled into Fraunce with his mother, he was principall receiuer of the kings reuenewes in Gascoigne. Their money failing, he ayded them secretly with a great summe of that he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for the king. It had almost cost him his life, he was so narrowly pursued by some of the kings friends that got vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of it, as he was glad to hide himselfe in a steeple in Paris the space of seuen daies. King <hi>Edward</hi> the third his
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:3306:272"/>
scholler being come to the crowne, made him first his Coferer, then Treasurer of the Wardrobe, and keeper of the priuy Seale. In this last office he continued fiue yéeres; in which space he was twice sent Ambassador vnto the Pope. The yeere 1333. he was made Deane of Welles (a goodly prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in those daies, better I thinke then the Bishopricke is now.) He had not enioyed that place one whole yeere, when he was consecrate vnto Durham, which was December 19. 1333. The yeere following he became Chauncellor, and within two yeeres after that, Treasurer of England. Being Bishop, he was often employed in embassages of the greatest importance.
