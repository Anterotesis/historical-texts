         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <q>And they that resist, shall receive to

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>AMongst all the stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems
of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
tending to the
undermining of
Religion, and the
subversion of the souls of men,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60674:5"/>
though there cannot be any more
unreasonable, yet there was never
any more unhappily successful,
than the creating and fomenting an
Opinion in the World, That Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is an enemy to Government,
and the bringing Sincerity and
Zeal in Religion into jealousie, and
disgrace with the Civil Powers.</p>
                  <p>It was by this jealousie, blown
into the heads of the High Priests,
and the Sanhedrim amongst the
Jews, and of <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Pontius
Pilate,</hi> that Christ himself (the
<hi>Captain of our Salvation,</hi> the <hi>Author
and Finisher of our Faith</hi>) was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
condemned, and executed on
a Tree. By this the Apostles were
haled before the Governours of
Provinces, forced from one City to
flee unto another: for this they
endured bonds, and imprisonment,
and sundry kinds of death. It was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60674:5"/>
through this fancy, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
for three hundred years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
endured the rage of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Emperours; <hi>being destitute,
afflicted, and tormented.</hi> Our
Lord Christ was traduced as <hi>an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to Caesar,</hi> a man refractary to the
Roman Laws, and a Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
to the Religion, and Laws of
his Country. The Apostles were
charged as disturbers of the publick
peace, with <hi>turning the world upside
down.</hi> The Primitive Christians
were accounted enemies to the
Commonwealth, adverse, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolent
to the Empire: and the
Christian Religion it self was bruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and surmised to have something
in it offensive, and dangerous to
the Civil Government; as appears
not only by the Edicts of Heathen
Emperours, but also by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies
of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60674:6"/>
Martyr, Tertullian, Athenagoras,
&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither was it thus only of old,
before the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Christian; but even since the
time of <hi>Constantine,</hi> down to our
Fathers days, nay to our own, we
shall find the Devil still managing
the same pretence, carrying on the
same Antichristian mystery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
which began to work in the
time of our Lord Christ, and his
Apostles.</p>
                  <p>Those, that profess to know the
<hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> and publickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
themselves to the World to
be qualified for Molders of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths,
and Dictatours to
Princes, are the Writers of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;
<hi>Machiavel</hi> abroad, and o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers;
nearer home: some of these,
pretending discoveries of things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to all our Fathers, if they be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60674:6"/>
strictly analysed, will be found to
resolve their whole mystery into
this one pretence, That Religion, in
the height and exaltation of it, is
prejudicial to Policy; and that, to
be a thorow-paced, a sincere and
zealous Christian, is to be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to the State.</p>
                  <p>As the remedy for which evil,
they have thought fit and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to enervate the Principles of all
Religion so far, as to remove the
Doctrine of Good and Evil, the
Immortality of the Soul, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and Punishments of the
World to come; that so Religion
may appear wholly to derive from
Policy.</p>
                  <p>How destructive these Doctrines
are, not only to the souls of men,
in reference to the World to come;
but to the interests of this life, (the
regular and secure acquisition and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60674:7"/>
enjoyment whereof, are entirely
derived from the great and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Ordinance of Government)
I am not now called to speak. But
surely it cannot be unnecessary to
endeavour to state this Question, to
search into the grounds of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
to examine thorowly from
whence all this clamour, these fears
and jealousies; whence all this
mighty scandal hath arisen.</p>
                  <p>The Gospel of our Saviour is not
like the Alcoran, which hates the
light, and abhors a strict exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Principles whereon
it stands. When the Jews con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with our Saviour, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
his Doctrine, he desired to
bring the matter in question to a
rational decision, <hi>Iohn</hi> x. The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
there was, Whether he were
the Son of God? And he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
them this fair <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>, Verse
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60674:7"/>
37. <hi>If I do the works of my Father,
believe me: if I do not, believe me
not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I verily, as a Minister of
Christ, (though the meanest of ten
thousand) am bold in the power,
and through the evidence of the
truth of the Gospel, to say, Let the
Adversaries of Religion search and
look; let them employ their Wit,
their Industry, their Logick, if any
thing can be found in the Principles
of Christianity, prejudicial to the
power of just and lawful Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates:
Nay moreover, if it be
possible for Men or Angels to state
the Rights of Civil Government
upon clearer and firmer Principles,
to secure them by more powerful
Obligations, to urge them upon
men by more efficacious Motives of
Rewards and Punishments, than
those are, which the very Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60674:8"/>
of Christianity do expresly
propound: then let the Gospel, and
the Ministers of it, endure all that
contempt and obloquy which these
men desire to cast upon them.</p>
                  <p>And for the Foundations of our
Religion; there are those, that tell
us, that Christianity is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Cephas, (which is,</hi> indeed, <hi>by
interpretation a Stone)</hi> but the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
tells us, (<hi>Ephes.</hi> ii. 20.) that we
<hi>are built upon the foundation of the
Prophets and Apostles, Iesus Christ
himself being the chief corner-stone:</hi>
wherefore by these the present Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is to be decided.</p>
                  <p>If any men, at any time, taking
upon them the sacred name of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
have swerved from the Rule
of their Profession, and (acting
contrary to the Spirit of Christ)
have made that holy Name to be
blasphemed; it is reason that they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60674:8"/>
be esteemed the utter enemies of
Christianity, and that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
should bear their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
but to charge their exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancies
upon that Profession which
they have prophaned and injured,
is such an injustice, as cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
with moral honesty, or Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical
ingenuity.</p>
                  <p>So then, <hi>hÃ®c Rhodus, hÃ®c saltus.</hi>
As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 14, 17, 20.)
concerning the Resurrection of
Christ, <hi>If Christ be not risen, our
preaching is vain, and your faith is
vain:â€”but now is Christ risen:</hi>
so I; If, within the compass of
those Foundations, which I have

or privy Conspiracies; for

the Defender of our Faith, look ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
first to defend himself. It will
then be reasonable to expect, that
the <hi>Kings of the earth</hi> should <hi>stand
up,</hi> and<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. ii. 2</note> 
                     <hi>the Rulers take counsel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
against the Lord, and against
his Christ,</hi> that they should <hi>break their
bonds in sunder, and cast their cords
from them:</hi> then <hi>our Preaching is
vain,</hi> and <hi>your Faith is vain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now indeed the case is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
and that evidently. What
the Laws of men could never do
with all their Temporal Rewards
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60674:9"/>
and Punishments, <hi>in that they are
weak;</hi> that Christianity, in the true
Spirit of it, performs, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
height that is conceiveable.</p>
                  <p>The Foundation of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Obedience, is deeply and
firmly rooted in the Foundation of
our Religion. And, if <hi>the Scripture
cannot be broken,</hi> if it be true, that
<hi>Heaven and Earth shall pass away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
one jot of it shall pass away:</hi> it
is as true, that the <hi>Ordinances of the

Ordinance shall be dissolved. For
if by the Principles of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we are obliged to believe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Books of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
that they have been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by <hi>holy men of God, who spake
as they were moved by the holy Ghost,</hi>
2 Pet. i. 21. then the holy Ghost
hath said, <hi>By me Kings reign,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Prov.</hi> viii. 15. If Christ be the Son
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60674:10"/>
of God, the Son of God hath said,
<hi>Render to Caesar the things which are
Caesars,</hi> Mat. xxii. 21. If the Holy
Spirit did overshadow <hi>Peter,</hi> and
the rest of the Apostles; then <hi>Peter,</hi>
overshadowed and filled with the
Spirit, commands us in the Name
of God to <hi>submit our selves to every
Ordinance of man,</hi> 1 Pet. ii. 13. If
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> were called to be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
by the miraculous appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of our Lord Christ after his
Ascension, and was by him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
instructed in the pure
and genuine spirit of Christianity;
then Saint <hi>Paul's</hi> Theory concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Government is an authentick
Christian Theory, whereby the
Doctrines and practises of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
are to be judged: and that
Theory is delivered in the seven first
Verses of this Chapter; <hi>Let every
soul be subject to the higher Powers,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I call it a Christian Theory of
Government, because it is a brief
and comprehensive Scheme, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
all Questions concerning Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

                  <p>The whole discourse of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle

                  </list>
                  <p>After all which the Apostle (like

They relate both to the Antecedent

<hi>against Powers, and the Rulers of this

may not separate their Personal and

                  <p>It remains, that we enquire the

                        <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>,
what it is to resist in the Language
of the Gospel. Now,</p>
                  <p>1. That to oppose by force is to
resist, it is so plain, that I need not
speak to it. We meet both the
words in that sence, <hi>Iames</hi> iv. 6, 7.
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>God resisteth

                     </gap>, <hi>Resist
the Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. But the word signifies <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
by subtilty,</hi> as well as <hi>by force.</hi>
The Opposition of <hi>Elymas</hi> the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60674:13"/>
to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> is expressed by
this word, <hi>Act.</hi> xii 8. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap> and
the opposition of <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres</hi>
to <hi>Moses,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

15.</p>
                  <p>3. And lastly, it signifies oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
by Words, as well as by
Deeds. So <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>to gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say,</hi>
and <hi>to resist,</hi> are the same, <hi>Luke</hi>
xxi. 15. and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap> is <hi>to contradict,</hi>
Acts vi. 10.</p>
                  <p>The words then do clearly and
plainly comprehend all manner of
resistance or opposition.</p>
                  <p>This hitherto concerns the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
taken materially: if we
reflect upon the form of it, there
will be two things to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
                  <p>First, That the Proposition is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite,
and equipollent to an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal;
<hi>They that resist,</hi> that is,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>every soul</hi> (as in the first
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60674:13"/>
Verse) that resists, without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of persons.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the Act of Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
is set down likewise abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
without any restraint, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of any pretences or causes
whatsoever. So that the sence of
the words resolved, and expounded
by the Scriptures, is this; Every
Soul, which upon any pretence
whatsoever, in any manner what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
shall resist the lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
that is over him, <hi>shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
to himself damnation,</hi> that is,
he puts himself thereby into a state
of damnation.</p>
                  <p>This I conceive to be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Holy Ghost in the words
of my Text. I must acknowledge,
that two things have been question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this Proposition by the men
of this unhappy, viperous, and
adulterous Generation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:60674:14"/>
I. The first is, Whether <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>
ought to be interpreted so severely,
as to signifie eternal damnation.</p>
                  <p>II. Whether that, which is said
concerning all persons and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
can be made good upon the
Principles of Christianity.</p>
                  <p>I. As to the former of these, I
shall only say, that the Argument
brought against this interpretation
doth, in truth, exceedingly confirm
it.</p>
                  <p>The Allegation is,<note place="margin">Object.</note> that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap> is
used in Scripture for Temporal
Judgment. The place produced
is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 29. <hi>He that eateth
and drinketh unworthily, eateth and
drinketh <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                        </gap>, damnation to himself:</hi>
where the Apostle seemeth to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap> by the following words,
Verse 30. <hi>For this cause many are
weak and sickly, and many sleep;</hi> viz.
by Temporal Judgments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:60674:14"/>
And indeed this is true;<note place="margin">Sol.</note> but
these things likewise ought to be
observed.</p>
                  <p>1. That the same penalty is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
in the Gospel to those,
who <hi>resist Authority,</hi> and to those,
that are <hi>guilty of the body of Christ,</hi>
1 Cor. xi. 27.<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 29.</note> and <hi>trample upon
the blood of the everlasting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. That neither <hi>Ananias</hi> and
<hi>Sapphira,</hi> nor yet the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
were by their Temporal Judgments
exempted from Eternal.</p>
                  <p>3. And lastly, That seeing the
great difference betwixt the Legal
and Evangelical dispensation did
consist in this, that the express
Promises and Threatnings, under
the Law, were Temporal; and
under the Gospel, Eternal: if God
shall, under the Gospel, besides
Eternal punishments due to every
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60674:15"/>
sin, add moreover to some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
sins the threatnings of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Judgments, let these men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what advantage they have
gotten, and what can more be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
to contribute to the aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of such a sin. I shall say
no more to the first Question, nor
to that part of the Text, which
concerns the damnation of Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
precisely considered: but shall
apply my self to the resolution of
the second.</p>
                  <p>II. It is impossible in half an
hour, to speak concerning all those
pretences for resistance of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates;
which, being raised by
Satan, and made use of by the
children of disobedience, are falsly
charged upon Religion. I shall
single out some of the chief of
them, and examine them by <hi>the
Law and the Testimony,</hi> by the Old
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60674:15"/>
and New Testament; adding to
them, as occasion requires, the
judgment and practise of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Christians; and afterwards
make a brief Application.</p>
                  <p>Those, which have given the
greatest scandal, as having troubled
the Christian World, and almost
turned it upside down, are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
to the two Heads of Religion,
and Civil Affairs.</p>
                  <p>First, Those which refer to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
are such scandalous Tenets
as these:</p>
                  <p>I. That Erroneous (suppose
Heretical or Idolatrous) Powers
may be resisted; especially if
they endeavour to force men to
their own Religion.</p>
                  <p>II. That Christian Magistrates
have no power in matters of
Religion: <hi>viz.</hi> None</p>
                  <list>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:60674:16"/>

                  <q>By Orders.</q>
                  <q>By personal Gifts.</q>
                  <p>Secondly, Those which refer to
matters Civil, are reducible to such
as these;

                  <p>Now I shall not be afraid or
backward to acknowledge, that if
any one of these Tenets be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Principles of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
or to the practise of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
and purest Christians, who
are to be presumed to have known
the mind of Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles;
then we are to admit, that
there is reason in what is alledged to
create a Jealousie upon Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:60674:16"/>
For, 1. If Erroneous, Heretical,
or Idolatrous Magistrates may be
resisted, (because they are so, or
because they join oppression of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men unto their errour in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion)
how can any Kingdom stand?
These are matters wherein every
man makes himself a Judge; and
it is not material, whether he judge
righteous or unrighteous judgment;
the matter once stated <hi>in Thesi,</hi> that
in such cases men may resist, the
<hi>Hypothesis</hi> is easily made, and men
let loose to act according to their
proper apprehensions, or the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of those, who have power
with them.</p>
                  <p>What shall be done, when, at
the same time, a Prince shall be
judged by one part of his Subjects
Heretical and prophane, for depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from Superstition, and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
his power from unjust Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60674:17"/>
over it; while another part
shall judge him to be Superstitious,
and will never believe him to abhor
Idols, so long as he will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
Sacrilege? What shall be done,
while some conclude him to be ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious,
because he will not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
Images; others Idolatrous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he kneels at the Communion?
and both esteem him an Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour,
because he restrains their Zeal,
and hinders them from that excess
of Riot, which they pant after, to
the devouring of one another?</p>
                  <p>Supposing this Tenet to be true,
it is indeed evident no Government
can be. But now what colour can
there be, to charge this Tenet upon
Christianity? Doth the Old or
New Testament give any occasion
to this Doctrine? Is it counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
(1.) by <hi>Moses,</hi> or (2.) by
the Prophets? or (3.) by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour?
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60674:17"/>
or (4.) by the Apostles?
(5) That <hi>Cloud of Witnesses,</hi> (the
Noble Army of Martyrs) did they
give Testimony to this Assertion,
or to the contrary? I may not
insist: a word to each of these.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Moses</hi> was so far from the
Doctrine of Resistance, that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the hardness of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh's</hi>
heart, the cruelty of the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
the weakness of the <hi>Egyptians</hi>
by Plagues, the numbers of <hi>Israel,</hi>
six hundred thousand, and three
thousand five hundred and fifty
fighting men above twenty years
old; besides the Tribe of <hi>Levi:</hi>
yet he would not lead them into
the promised Land without <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh's</hi>
positive and express consent
to their departure.</p>
                  <p>2. As for the Prophets; in the
third Chapter of <hi>Daniel</hi> we find
three of Gods Children put to the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60674:18"/>
trial (the fiery trial) of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later,
and a Tyrant, acting highly
under both those Capacities toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
They were cast into the fiery
Furnace, because they would not
worship the Golden Image which
he had set up. And in the sixth,
we find <hi>Daniel</hi> thrown into the
Lions Den, only for praying to the
God of <hi>Israel.</hi> Let us consider their
Behaviour, did they resist, or mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny,
or labour to alienate, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
or (by denouncing threats
or terrours) to discourage Subjects
from Obedience? How had they
been instructed by their Prophets?
<hi>Ieremy</hi> (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxxvi. 13.) had
taught them, that <hi>Zedekiah</hi> had
turned from the Lord God of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
in rebelling against <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi>
who had <hi>made him swear
by God:</hi> and that they ought <hi>to seek
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60674:18"/>
the peace of the City whither they were
carried Captives, and to pray unto the
Lord for it,</hi> Jer. xxix. 7. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the three Children in the third
of <hi>Daniel</hi> only refer themselves to
God for deliverance; and <hi>Daniel,</hi>
in the midst of the Lions Den, prays
heartily for <hi>Darius, O King, live for
ever!</hi> Dan. vi. 21.</p>
                  <p>3. In the next place, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the case of Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
and see whether any such
Tenet may be collected from their
Doctrine or Practice, their Speeches
or their Actions. As for what
concerns our Lord Christ, I have
had the Honour formerly in this
place more at large to vindicate
him from such aspersions. He paid
Tribute at the expence of a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
<hi>Mat.</hi> xvii. 27. He submitted
himself to all the Powers that were
over him; to the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60674:19"/>
their Delegates, to <hi>Herod,</hi> to <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
Pilate:</hi> he submitted himself
to death by an unjust sentence, even
to the bitter and accursed death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Cross, <hi>Philip.</hi> ii. 8. This was
his Practise: as for his Doctrine;
He taught men to <hi>render to Caesar
the things that were Caesars,</hi> Mat.
xxii. 21. He acknowledged <hi>Pilate's
power</hi> to be <hi>from above,</hi> John xix.
11. He rebuked <hi>Peter</hi> for smiting
with the Sword; and told him, that
<hi>those that take the Sword, shall perish
by the Sword,</hi> Mat. xxvi. 52. He
taught his Disciples to <hi>pray for</hi> them
<hi>which</hi> should <hi>persecute</hi> them, <hi>Mat.</hi>
v. 44. And the utmost permission
which he gave them, was, when
they were <hi>persecuted in one City, to
flee unto another,</hi> Matth x. 23.</p>
                  <p>4. As for the Apostles: They
taught men to <hi>obey them that have
the rule over them,</hi> Hebr. xiii. 17.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60674:19"/>
                     <hi>To submit themselves to every Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of man,</hi> 1 Pet. ii. 13. <hi>To do all
things without murmuring or dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi>
Philip. ii. 14. <hi>To pray for Kings,
and all that are in Authority,</hi> 1 Tim.
ii. 2. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> hath told us, that
such as <hi>despise Dominion,</hi> and <hi>speak
evil of Dignities,</hi> are (in an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
manner) <hi>reserved to Iudgment,</hi>
1 Pet. ii 9, 10. and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in
my Text, that <hi>they shall receive dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Doctrine they Sealed with
their blood. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> (according
to Ecclesiastical Tradition) was
crucified, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> beheaded,
<hi>Iames</hi> the Son of <hi>Zobedeus</hi> slain
with the Sword, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, as for the Powers, to which
all these Instructions and Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
did refer, they were for Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and Tyranny, and Persecution,
<hi>Humani generis portenta.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:60674:20"/>
If it be objected,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> That all these
submitted, because they were not
able to resist:<note place="margin">Sol.</note> the Answer, upon
Christian Principles, might be;
That He, which restrained the
Flames, and <hi>stopped the mouths of
Lions,</hi> could have given his Servants
power to resist; that Christ could
have <hi>prayed his Father,</hi> who would
<hi>have given him more than twelve Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of Angels</hi> for his relief;<note place="margin">Matth. 26. 53.</note> that
the Apostles, who wrought migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
signs and wonders, could have
rescued themselves: had it not
rather pleased the great Ordainer
of Powers, by their submission, to
ratifie and establish the Doctrine
of Obedience.</p>
                  <p>5. But the belief, and practise of
the Primitive Christians will satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
this Objection even to common
Sense and Reason.</p>
                  <p>The Instances in this kind are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60674:20"/>
where Christians, abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in numbers, being in Arms,
and abundantly able to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
have chosen, with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of their lives, to yield obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to Idolaters, persecuting
them for their Religion. I shall
name but two Examples.</p>
                  <p>Tertullian<note n="*" place="margin">Apolog. Â§ 37.</note> 
                     <hi>tells the Emperour,
that his</hi> Cities, Islands, Castles, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
Armies, Regiments, <hi>and</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies;
<hi>the</hi> Palace, <hi>the</hi> Senate, <hi>the</hi>
Courts <hi>of</hi> Judicature were filled with
Christians: <hi>and yet they submitted
to persecution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And we read that the <hi>Thebean</hi>
Legion consisted of six thousand,
six hundred, sixty and six persons,
every man Christian, when they
submitted to the Decimation of
<hi>Maximinian</hi> for Religion.</p>
                  <p>I shall say no more to the first
Pretence.</p>

II. Now the second is like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

alike false, and scandalous

                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. xiv. 33.</note> and <hi>God is not the

and that especially in Religion. If
none have this power to order mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion, there must be
Confusion: if any other beside
the Supreme Magistrate, there will
be Division. The inevitable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
of the exemption of
religious Things, and religious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
from the power of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
are abundantly set forth
by such, as would improve them
to the disadvantage of Religion.
And, indeed, to go about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
or to diminish the dismal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
of such Pretences, were
to endeavour to put out the eyes of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60674:21"/>
all the men of Reason, and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
in the world.</p>
                  <p>My present Duty is to enquire,
what relation these Pretences have
to the Principles of Christianity;
and that</p>
                  <p>First, As to religious Causes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As to Ecclesiastical
Persons.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As to holy, or gifted
Brethren; as they style them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</p>
                  <p>Now, in order to a resolution
in these Enquiries, I shall (as a
Lemma) humbly propose one Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.</p>
                  <p>It is this, That, whereas there
are two things, whereon all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
administration doth depend:
<hi rend="sup">1.</hi> Concerning the Rights, and
Bounds, and regulation of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Powers; <hi rend="sup">2.</hi> Concerning the
Duties, and Obedience of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60674:22"/>
we find both Christ, and
the Apostles, frequently labouring
to settle in the Consciences of men
that part, which concerns Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
but no where restraining,
or limiting, or particularly regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
the Office of Sovereign
Powers; but leaving them to
those general Rules, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the Account and Duty of all
men in their several stations, and
to the terms, whereupon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God was wont to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
the Princes, and Governours
of the World. Let the rights of
<hi>Caesar</hi> be what they will (in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to Tribute, or other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters)
Christ will not determine
them: This he will; those things,
which belong to <hi>Caesar</hi> (according
to <hi>Jus Gentium</hi>) must be rendered
to him. He doth not examine
<hi>Pilate's</hi> power, in case of Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60674:22"/>
or Treason; but acknowledges
it, and submits. He falls not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
sifting, or examining the power
of the <hi>Sanhedrim;</hi> either their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
power, or the power left
them by the Romans: <hi>They sit
in Moses Chair,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Whatsoever
therefore they bid you do, do it,</hi>
Matth. xxiii. 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>And so likewise the Apostles,
they seem to be unconcerned (as
it were) in the governing part of
Civil Policy. No word is found
in all their Writings, enquiring
into the Rights of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
(who were sovereign) or
limiting the Exercise of their
Power. Only thus much they
take for certain, such, as they
were, they were ordained of God.
And they spend all their labour
in founding deeply, and firmly
establishing that other part, which
concerns Obedience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:60674:23"/>From this Observation it will
follow, That whatever Things,
or Persons were not before the
times of Christ, and his Apostles,
exempt from the power of the
Magistrate, are not by the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
and Principles of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
exempted. (<hi>Non eripit mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia,
qui regna dat coelestia.</hi>) And
it will only remain for us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
what was the manner of
the Nations of the World, and of
God's peculiar people, in reference
to these Particulars, before, and
at the times of Christ, and his
Apostles. To which if we shall
add the practice of the best, and
most ancient Christian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
I know not what more can
be desired to clear the present Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
                  <p>I suppose it needless to put in
a Caution, that while we speak
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60674:23"/>
of the Magistrate's power to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
matters of Religion; we do
not entitle him to the Priest's Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
(the Spiritual Function) or
the Execution of it, in preaching
the word, administring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
exercising the power of
Ordination, or of the Keys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Blessed be the Lord God of our
Fathers, who hath put it into our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign's
heart to be tender of the
rights of the Church, as of the
Apple of his Eye.</p>
                  <p>This is a Calumny insisted on
generally by almost all our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
but it is too rude, and gross,
to be spoken to in this place. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
let us see whether the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns
among all people, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
Jews, Christians, have not
claimed, and exercised power in
all Causes, over all Persons, as
well Ecclesiastical, as Civil.</p>

sometimes divides the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles

sometimes into wise, and unwise:
according to which division the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
are, I suppose, reckoned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Greeks, from whence they

And, accordingly, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
the Fragments, which are left

we shall find nothing so frequent,

                  <p>(3.) As for the Barbarous
Nations, I shall not multiply Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies,
nor go beyond the line
of Scripture. In the third of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
we find an Edict of the King
of Babylon enjoyning all <hi>People,

Idolatry; <hi>Vers. 4. 5.</hi> And, by and
by, another Edict, that <hi>no man
should speak amiss of the God of Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drach,
Mesech, and Abednego</hi> Vers. 29.
In the sixth we find <hi>Darius</hi> (the

signing a Decree, against <hi>peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning

another, that <hi>all men should trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

Verse 26. In the third of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi>
the King of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and his

In the first of <hi>Ezra, Cyrus</hi> puts
forth an Edict to build the

In the sixth <hi>Darius</hi> re-inforceth
it.</p>
                  <p>I suppose it is now evident, that
Greeks, and Barbarians did exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
this power.</p>
                  <p>To think to elevate the force
of these Instances, because all these
were <hi>Strangers from God,</hi>

these concerning the Worship of
God, and matters of Religion are
recorded, and applauded in the
Scriptures. For these all ordered,
and regulated Services, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Covenants with God;
they erected Altars and Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles,
and Temples, and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
them unto the Lord; they
destroyed Idolatry, reformed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses
in Gods Worship, settled
both the standing Worship of
God, and occasional Thanks-giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and Humiliations: to omit
other matters.</p>
                  <p>The whole <hi>Aaronical</hi> Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which consisted in ceremonies,
and Sacrifices, Typical, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60674:26"/>
Ordinances, was not ordered
by the hand of <hi>Aaron,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. xxxiii. 5.</note> but of
<hi>Moses,</hi> who was <hi>King in Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Tabernacle, and Temple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>service
(which, beside the Mosai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Institutions, consisted of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
abiding Ordinances) was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
by <hi>David:</hi> who, being
<hi>the sweet Singer of Israel,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
more then ever any man
(for ought appears) with the ways,
and helps of lifting up the Heart
to spiritual intercourse with God,
to that end appointed the use of
Musick in the Church; and (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fear of stinting the Spirit) he
prescribed Set-forms of Praise,
and Prayers for the use of the
Temple; and ordered the service
for every day. A Psalm, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
partly of the one hundred
and fifth, ninety sixth, and one
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60674:27"/>
hundred and eighteenth, he first
delivered to <hi>Asaph,</hi> and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
at the reduction of the
Ark from the house of <hi>Obed-Edom;</hi>
1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xvi. 7. And divers other
<hi>Psalms</hi> were composed by him for
the Service of the Church.</p>
                  <p>And what he had ordained, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
put in practice. In the fifth
Chapter of the second Book of

                  </p>
                  <p>The one hundred thirty and

to be sung in Thanksgivings. So
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60674:27"/>
we find also <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Iosiah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Chron. xxix. 25.</note>
                     <hi>praising the Lord in the words of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus stood the matter under
the Law; the ordering of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion was not exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Supreme Power.
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> varied from <hi>Moses</hi> his
Law, and was blameless. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was it otherwise in the best,
and purest Times under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
                  <p>It had been but a slender invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to the Emperours to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Christian; if, by submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to Christianity, they must
lose so considerable a part of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
Power enjoyed by all
their Predecessours, and be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
exposed inevitably to Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Rebellions, upon every
Frantick eruption of religious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.
The primitive Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60674:28"/>
understood themselves other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
and so did the Christians
under them. I may not stand
to recite the <hi>Annals</hi> of the Church.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Constantine</hi> had not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
for the composing of the
<hi>Arrian</hi> Heresie, what had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
either of Government, or
Religion?</p>
                  <p>The drawing up of Canons
for the regulation of Religion
was by our Lord committed to
the Apostles, and their Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours,
the Bishops, and other Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Persons: but, that these
Canons should be enforced as
Laws by temporal Penalties it, was
by sanction of Civil powers.</p>
                  <p>In the second Oecumenical
Council, the Fathers, assembled
at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> beseech <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi>

this Question, we need
only to view the Titles of the

<hi>Theodosius,</hi> the thirteen first Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
in the <hi>Code</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Pretence of exemption of
Ecclesiastical Causes, so as hath
been intimated, as it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with Government; so it is
also with the Principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.</p>
                  <p>2. Thus much having been
spoken concerning the regulation
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60674:29"/>
of Matters of Religion, it will be
needless to enlarge concerning the
second Pretence of the exemption
of Ecclesiastical Persons.</p>
                  <p>This Tenet is equally dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
with the former, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contrary to the Principles of
Christianity. It were to be wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that all men professing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Ministers were thorowly
convinced of the Doctrine of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience:
otherwise, as they
grow popular, they become dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.
<hi>Sacerdotum quidam eo sunt

And Saint <hi>Chrysostom</hi> commenting

                     </gap>.
Both the
Apostle, the Evangelist, and the
Prophet. Our Saviour was both
Priest, and Prophet; and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
were Ecclesiastical persons: yet
did not think themselves exempted.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60674:29"/>
Such persons were not exempted,
either before, or after the Times of
our Saviour; neither in <hi rend="sup">1.</hi> a Single,
or <hi rend="sup">2.</hi> Joynt capacity.<note place="margin">Mat. xix. 8.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>1. As to Single persons under
the Law, we find an Instance of
the Exercise of the Sovereign
power over an High-Priest of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
in <hi>Abiathar,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Kings ii. 27.</note> whom <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon

                  </p>
                  <p>2. As to the calling of Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies;
before the Gospel-times,
it did belong to the Supreme
Magistrate. We find <hi>Moses,</hi> not
<hi>Aaron; Ioshuah,</hi> not <hi>Eleazar; Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
not <hi>Abiathar; Solomon,</hi> not
<hi>Zadoc;</hi> summoning the Priests,
and Levites, to meet together.
And</p>
                  <p>In the Primitive Times of the
Christian Emperours, we do not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60674:30"/>
meet with Councils, or Synods
called by the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
nor with Ministers, casting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into Classical, and Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical
Meetings; nor with As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
of Divines, called a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
or without the Prince's
consent.</p>
                  <p>The indiction of Times, and
Places, the convocation of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
the Presidency, the order
of Debates, the dismission of the
Assemblies, the roboration of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
(as to making them Laws
of the Empire) in the General,
and provincial Councils, were all
the work of the Supreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.
And</p>
                  <p>As for matters of Appeal, we
find <hi>Paul</hi> appealing to <hi>Caesar: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius</hi>
(from the Synod at
<hi>Tyre</hi>) to <hi>Constantine;</hi> to whom
three Appeals were likewise made
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60674:30"/>
in the Cause of <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> and
<hi>Donatus:</hi> and many more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of this, and the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>3. I should now dismiss this
Head concerning Religion, did
there not remain one Pretence
more, and that so wild, and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous,
that it looks as if it were
the last effort of the enemy of
man-kind <hi>(ultimus Diaboli cona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus)</hi>
for it strikes at the Heart
both of Government, and of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
It is this, that Saints, and
gifted Persons, (as they call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves)
are exempt from humane
Laws: and in effect resolves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this, that to reprobate others,
and assume to themselves the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of the Godly Party, to talk
of Reformation, and the Power
of Godliness, of advancing the
Kingdom of Jesus Christ <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>But my present purpose being
chiefly to remove these scandals
from Religion; come, and let
us reason together, What could
Christ, and his Apostles have
done more to prevent this scandal,
then they have done? Their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and practice hath been
already shewn; and the Danger,
and Heinousness of the Sin of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60674:32"/>
Resistance (in all the kinds, and

can any thing more be imagined,
which might be desired to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate,

unless it be, that these things
should have been particularly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told,
and the Persons (at least their
Party and Sect) described; that
the world might be forewarned of
them.</p>
                  <p>Will it then satisfy the enemies
of our Religion, concerning the
Truth, and Infallibility of the
Scriptures, and the abhorrency
of the Christian Principle from
this damnable Tenet; if it shall

have been punctually foretold by

Saint <hi>Iude</hi> hath taken up
this Prophesie of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and
given us two clear Characters of
these Persons, whereby they might

upon that other Head referring

in two Pretences taken
from,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>I. Harsh Administration in the
Magistrate.</item>

Subjects.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>I. Neither the Time, nor the
Design, which I have propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
nor (indeed) my Profession
nor Abilities do allow me to
enter into the depths of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks,
or to discourse of the
limitations of Sovereign Powers.
Thus much is obvious to every
man,</p>
                  <p>That there is no Cruelty so
great as laxness of Government,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60674:33"/>
nor any Tyrany in the World
like the rage of Subjects let loose;
and that <hi>the little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ictest
Government.</p>
                  <p>I shall briefly shew, that the
Scripture, foreseeing the easiness
(by reason of the Self-love, and
partiality of men) of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and the danger of it,
hath directly opposed it self against
it.</p>
                  <p>I shall not mention particular
Commands: let us have recourse
to the main Foundations; the
Body, and Substance of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
the MISHPATHAME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEK
(the <hi>Ius Regium</hi>) the
Fundamental Law of the Kings
of <hi>Israel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Christianity obligeth us to
believe not only, that Christ is
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60674:34"/>
God, and that the Gospel is from
God: but that all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of the Ministery of Christ,
and his Apostles, were ordered by
his Providence. Why then were
the times of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula,</hi>
and <hi>Claudius,</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> (out
of the Series of the Time spun
out from the Creation) chosen,
and selected for the promulgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Doctrine of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
If harsh Administration
of Power will exempt men from
Obedience; at that time, when
<hi>Claudius,</hi> or <hi>Nero</hi> was <hi>Roman</hi>
Emperour, why should the Holy
Ghost move Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to write
to the <hi>Romans, They that resist,
shall receive to themselves Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
So much briefly for the
Gospel.</p>
                  <p>2. As for the <hi>Ius Regium</hi> in the
eighth of the first Book of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:60674:34"/>
we find the <hi>Israelites</hi> desiring

or enable them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist

                  <p>II. There remains yet one Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to speak to, it concerns Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
of Power, either on
<list>
                        <item>1. Pretences of Succession in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Magistrate's place in case
of failour of Duty, or upon

supposals of forfeiture of Power.</item>
                        <item>2. Pretences of the last resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

like.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning which kind of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
I must repeat what hath
been said of the other. If they
be admitted, they are destructive
to Magistracy. If they be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
by Religion, there will be
reason, that Magistrates be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
over it. But now is the
Spirit of the Scriptures, and the
tendency of it entirely bent ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way.</p>
                  <p>The New Testament affords
no Instance in this kind. As
to the Old, I shall desire, that
two Instances may be considered.
<list>
                        <item>1. The Case of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Saul.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. The Case of <hi>Corah,</hi> and <hi>Moses:</hi>
                        </item>

                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:60674:36"/>
which two Instances (if the time
would bear it) would take in the
Substance of all, that may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
in this kind.</p>
                  <p>1. It is (I conceive) impossible
to carry the first sort of Pretences
higher, then they were stated in
the Case of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Saul. Saul</hi>
was at first declared, and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
King by <hi>Samuel,</hi> acting in
the Name of the Lord: and,
when he had reigned two years,
the same <hi>Samuel,</hi> in the Name of
the same God, before the same
people, denounces publickly, that
his Kingdom should not continue;<note place="margin">1 S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</note>
and that God had sought <hi>a man
after his own heart,</hi> because he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
the Priests Office. After this,
he limits a certain day, he tells
him,<note place="margin">Chap. xv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap> 12.</note> 
                     <hi>This day the Lord bath rent
the Kingdom of Israel from thee, and
given it to thy neighbour,</hi> because of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60674:37"/>
his rebellion against God in the
Case of <hi>Amalek.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The pretence of Failour, and
Forfeiture can go no higher. Now
for the pretences of <hi>David</hi> to step
into his Government, and wrest
it from him: He was anointed
by <hi>Samuel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chap xvi. 13.</note> for ought appears,

                     <hi>a valiant man, a man
of War, prudent in matters, a comely
Person, and the Lord was with
him.</hi> He had received Testimony
from God of his Election: the
Spirit of God departed from <hi>Saul,</hi>
and rested upon him. He had
power in his hand,<note place="margin">Chap. xvi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

over the men of War, accepted by all
the people</hi> all <hi>Israel,</hi> nd <hi>Iudah</hi>
loved him. After all this, you
know his Provocations, his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
and his Behaviour; he
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60674:37"/>
durst not <hi>touch the Lords anointed;</hi>
and, when another pretended to
have done it at <hi>Saul's</hi> entreaty <hi>in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremis,</hi>
he revenged his death, and
lamented over him,<note place="margin">2 Sam. i. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Ye mountains
of Gilboa,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. But that other Pretence, that
after a lawful Sovereign is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
(according to the Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of my Text, and my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course)
the power still remains in
the people, (in the diffused body
of them, or their Representatives)
to alter the Government, as they
please; it is in respect of Policy,
and Government, what the Sin
against the Holy Ghost is to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
it destroys the foundations
of the peace, and safety of men,
and makes that to be the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of man, which is the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God. How much God
abhorred this Pretence, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60674:38"/>
in the Case of <hi>Corah,</hi> and his

of the Eldest Tribe. <hi>Korah,</hi> an

was offended, that the High-Priests
Office went beside him, and was

                  <p>These were their secret griefs;

what God had done to

of the noise of the Bells, of

which we hear? On the other hand

                  <p>It may be, God suffered the late
Rebellion to prevail, that he might
not <hi>leave himself without witness,</hi> but
shew forth his wonders in our
days, in the miraculous restitution
of our gracious Sovereign, and
the Church. If he had not been
driven out, how could he have
been restored? <hi>not by might, nor
by power, but by the Spirit of our
God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be, this was done, that
we might say no more, <hi>The Lord

Treason of pretended Catholicks:
but <hi>The Lord liveth which hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered</hi>
us from the Tyranny, and

                  <p>Surely, all these things have
been permitted, that the <hi>Stone which,

made <hi>tried and precious,</hi> and that
his Patience, his Piety, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy

to all the World, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
<hi>desire of all Nations,</hi> he
might become the <hi>head of the

                  </p>
                  <p>Surely, these things were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
that the Faith, and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and Loyalty of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> might be made bright
and glorious by the Flames of
Persecution: and that in the day,
when God shall have given our

may not repent him of the Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
he hath shewn to Religion,

which is the Object of the

common Faith which was once delivered
to the Saints</hi> (in the preaching of

I conceive it is to be taken in this
place. So that the meaning of the
whole is this, The Old Testament
understood and expounded accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Analogy of the New,
is able to make a man wise. And
the Pen-men of the Canonical
Books of the Old Testament
(wherein <hi>Timothy</hi> had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>) and of the Books
of the New Testament (which
except those of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
before the writing of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle)
were inspired and directed
by the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:60674:45"/>The words of the Text are an
entire Proposition, asserting the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority of the Canon of
Scripture; and my endeavour shall
be at this time to prove the truth of
that Proposition. Wherein, that I
may proceed with all plainness and
clearness, I shall premise two
words by way of Petition, Precaution.</p>
                  <p>1. By way of Petition, I suppose
and take for granted;</p>
                  <p>1. The great principle of the
power of God, and his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in governing the world.</p>
                  <p>2. That our Body of Canonical
Books of the Old Testament,
is the same with that which
was in Use in the time of
Christ and his Apostles, And
our body of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the same which was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
received in the Church,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60674:46"/>
So that what shall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of those, is applicable
to the Original Scripture used
in our time.</p>
                  <p>3. That those Books of New
Testament whose Authors
were not anciently question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
were written by those
Authors whose name they
bear. And that those few
others which were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
questioned by some
particular Churches, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
Universally receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
contain in them no one
point of Faith or Manners
dissentient from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of those Books which
were never questioned.</p>
                  <p>2. By way of Precaution and
Admonition I must intreat you to
take notice, that I shall not now
meddle with the Controversies
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60674:46"/>
concerning Apocrypha, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations,
<hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Chetib,</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
points, various Lections,
dubious Authors or parts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>But my endeavour at this time
shall be to Assert the Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the body and substance
of the Original Books of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
of the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And this not in the way
of common place, but in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Examination or Refutation
of the most dangerous Opinions
of the Antiscripturists, which are
these:</p>
                  <p>I. Of those who pretend to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the truth of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and yet they deny the Divine
Authority of the Old.</p>
                  <p>II. Of those who pretend to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the truth, but deny the Divine
Authority of the New Testament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:60674:47"/>III. Of such as pret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>nd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
matters of Fact to have been
truly related in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but do not believe the truth
of the Doctrinal parts relating to
Faith and Manners.</p>
                  <p>IV. Such as deny the truth of
the Relation of matters of Fact in
the New Testament, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
reject the whole Body of
Scripture. Of these as briefly and
plainly as I can.</p>
                  <p>I. The first Opinion is of those,
who pretending to believe the
Truth of the New Testament, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the Divine Authority of the
Old Testament. The <hi>Severians,</hi>
and the <hi>Manich<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Fanatical Sectaries amongst our

                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:60674:47"/>
In opposition to these, I shall
shew, that supposing the truth of
the New Testament, the Divine
Authority of the Old Testament
is to be acknowledged: Because
the Divine Authority of the Old
Testament is asserted by Christ and
his Evangelists and Apostles in the
New.</p>
                  <p>1. Next to the Redemption of
the world, the great business which
Christ had to do upon Earth, was
to Convince men that he was
the Messias, and so to assert his
Legislative Authority. And the
great Argument which he used
for the conviction of the world was
this.</p>
                  <p>All the Marks and the entire
Character of the Messiah, and of
his Actions and Passions, were
prefigured and foretold by <hi>the Law
and the Prophets,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 24 44</note> 
                     <hi>and the Psalms,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60674:48"/>
i. e.</hi> in the Volume of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>And all things foretold or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured
concerning the Messiah,
were accomplished by himself.</p>
                  <p>So that though the great Works
of Christ, and the purity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of his Doctrine, and of
his Life, were of themselves suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to justifie the Introduction of
his Law into the World, yet he
was pleased to resolve (as it were)
his own Authority into the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to make use of those
othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> manifestations of himself, in
a co-ordination with that principle.</p>
                  <p>And therefore we find him still
pressing the <hi>Iews</hi> with this, that
if they did believe the Writings of
<hi>Moses,</hi> and their other Scriptures,
they must of necessity believe him
also.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This is the sense of the New
Testament concerning the Old
Testament; supposing therefore
the Truth of the New Testament,
the Divine Authority of the Old
Testament is to be acknowledged,
contrary to the first Opinion of
the Antiscripturists.</p>
                  <p>II. The Second Antiscriptural
Opinion is of those who pretend
to believe the Truth, but they
deny or doubt the Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the New Testament, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60674:52"/>
of the whole body of the New
Testament, or at least of that part
which delivers the Speeches and
Writings of the Apostles.</p>
                  <p>Of this sort there are said to
be many, who by the power and
influence of their Education are
restrained from denying or dis-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
the Truth of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
and yet through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicity
of corrupt conversation are
fallen from that Veneration which
is due to writings supposed to be
of Divine Authority.</p>
                  <p>For the History of the New
Testament they have the same
respect which they have for <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi>
or <hi>Sallust,</hi> or some such other
History; for the Mystery of the
Gospel, the same which they have
for some part of <hi>Plato,</hi> or rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
of <hi>Pythagoras;</hi> for the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
parts, the same which they
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60674:52"/>
have for some parts of <hi>Cicero</hi> or
<hi>Seneca,</hi> or <hi>Epictetus.</hi> All which
writings they believe to be true,
but no man believes them to be
Divine. And some there are who
pretend a great veneration for the
speeches of Christ, but have a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
esteem for the words, and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Apostles.</p>
                  <p>In opposition to these opinions,
I shall shew, that supposing the
words of Christ and the Apostles
to be True, it will follow, that
they are to be esteemed to be of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority.</p>
                  <p>Because Christ and the Apostles
did profess and declare, that what
they delivered to the world, was of
Divine Authority.</p>
                  <p>And because our Lord Christ
did undertake not only for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
but for the Inspiration of his
Apostles also.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:60674:53"/>
1. In the examination of the
next Opinion, I shall be obliged
to lay before you some of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of Divine Authority in
Christ and his Apostles, here it is
sufficient to produce their assertions
of it.</p>
                  <p>The time of our Lord Christs
ministration (betwixt three and
four years) was spent in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and working, and his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
was often questioned.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Luke</hi> 20. 1.<note place="margin">Matth. 21. 23.</note> and in the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
places,<note place="margin">Mar. 11. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>While he was in the Temple
teaching the People, and preaching the
the Gospel, the Chief Priests and the
Scribes and the Elders came upon him,
saying, tell us by what Authority thou
dost these things</hi> (preachest to the
people,) <hi>and who gave thee that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Knowing the perverseness of
their minds, he was not pleased
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60674:53"/>
to gratifie them at that time with
a direct answer, but confounded
them with a question concerning
the Baptism of <hi>Iohn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But at other times, upon other
occasions, we find the Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of his teaching abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared and asserted by him.</p>

                  <p>How all these promises were
performed, and how the Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Divine Authority of
the Words of Christ, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
were proved to be true, I
am next to shew. In the interim
I conclude that supposing the truth
of the words of Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
they are to be esteemed of
Divine Authority.</p>
                  <p>III. The third opinion is of
such as pretend to believe matters
of fact to have been truly related
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60674:57"/>
in the New Testament, but they
do not believe the truth of the
Doctrinal parts relating to Faith or
Manners.</p>
                  <p>Of these there have always been
too great a number, not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders,
who under a form of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
deny the power thereof,
but generally all sorts of Hereticks.
When <hi>Porphyrius</hi> had revolted from
Christianity to Platonism, and
had bent all his forces against the
Scripture-History, he was refuted
not only by <hi>Lactantius,</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodius,</hi>
men Orthodox in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
but by <hi>Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linaris;</hi>
and of late days, <hi>Socinus</hi>
and others have well asserted the
truth of the Scripture-History,
who yet have been offended at the
dogmatical parts of the Gospel, and
concerning the Faith have made
shipwrack.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:60674:57"/>In Opposition to these I shall
endeavour to demonstrate, that,
Supposing Matters of Fact to be
truly related in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it is unreasonable to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the truth of any of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
delivered by Christ or his
Apostles.</p>
                  <p>Amongst the various fancies
concerning Religion, wherewith
the whole world hath been always
embroiled: Two things there are
wherein all the Sons of Adam have
agreed; namely, 1. That that is
to be believed which hath received
the testimony of God. And 2. That
this Testimony is to be gathered
from instances of supernatural Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Power.</p>
                  <p>In the study of natural and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical
Theology, the <hi>Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivi</hi>
amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
and other Nations, sought
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60674:58"/>
after wisdom, (Reason, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration.)
But, to reduce the
People to the forms of religious
Rites and Sacrifices prescribed
them, they were made to believe
the Epiphanies of the Gods, and
the manifestations of their Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and Power, by Oracles and
Works supernatural.</p>
                  <p>To these even <hi>Mahomet</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
though his great Argument
was from the Sword: and of the
Jews I need not speak.</p>
                  <p>For a Foundation of Religion,
and in our inquisition after that,
short of this Testimony we ought
not to stay; further we cannot
go: And herein is the utmost of
humane wisdom to consider well
those Evidences upon which we
adventure the interest of our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p>To this evidence therefore we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60674:58"/>
in asserting the Doctrine of our
Lord Christ, and his Apostles;
Namely to the instances of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Knowledge and Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Power, whereby their Doctrine
was attested.</p>
                  <p>I shall not here wave the force,
but I shall decline the repetition
of what I have formerly spoken
concerning the attestations given
to it by Visible Signs, Audible
Voices, Apparitions of Angels, Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
the Prophecies, Evidences of
Christs Resurrestion, Mission of the
Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Ioh. 7. 15.</hi> the Jews wondred
at Christ that he knew any thing:

                           <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>

                  <p>This is the state of the matter
of Fact, as it is propounded in
the New Testament: I conclude
therefore, that, supposing matters
of Fact to be truly delivered in the
New Testament, there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to doubt of the Doctrines de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
by Christ or his Apostles,
relating to faith or manners. And
I come to the consideration of the
last and extream Opinion of the
Antiscripturists.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:60674:64"/>
IV. The last opinion, is of those
who deny the truth of the Relation
of matters of Fact delivered in the
New Testament, and in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
reject the whole body of the
Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>I could wish there were no such
as these, and that what I have yet
to say were altogether needless for
that reason.</p>
                  <p>But what mean then the publick
Rumors which we hear? and
whence is an Opinion gone into the
world, that some great Philosophers
and men of generous reason are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied
concerning the truth of
Scripture, and believe the Authority
of it to be wholy derived from the
Magistrate?</p>
                  <p>In reference to these I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,</p>
                  <p>1. Briefly, to shew that the
ground upon which these Wisemen
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60674:64"/>
and Philosophers reject the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
is contrary to the Reason of
mankind.</p>
                  <p>2. To evince, that the belief
of the Divine Authority of the
Scriptures is most agreeable to
Reason.</p>
                  <p>1. As for the Argument and
ground of those (amongst us
Christians) that reject the body
of the Scriptures, I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to have heard of other than
this.</p>
                  <p>They have often called upon
Believers, Pastors perhaps, or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
in the Church, for a clear
and undeniable evidence of the
truth of the story of the Gospel, and
they have not afforded it: therefore
they conclude, the Scriptures are
to be rejected.</p>
                  <p>But is this the reasoning of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
wits? and men of mighty
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60674:65"/>
deeds in disputation, of men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to the depths of reason and
Philosophy?</p>
                  <p>To give a man a clear and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
evidence of any thing,
there are but two ways, <hi>viz.</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
either his Senses or his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;
the former where of is
to be done by experiment, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by demonstration.</p>
                  <p>Would they have now an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
whether such or such a
thing were done 16 or 17 hundred
years ago? Would they have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of particulars, in their
nature indifferent to be done or not
to be done, depending upon the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Causes?</p>
                  <p>Well were it for the world, if
these <hi>Beaux Esprits</hi> would have
the patience, and endure the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue
of acquainting themselves
with the ways of knowledge (Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60674:65"/>
and demonstration) it
would not then be troubled with
the dangerous impertinency of such
Pretenders</p>
                  <p>Then these men would not call
for Experiment in a subject unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of it, and (being instructed
that demonstration is only of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal
Propositions <hi>in materia ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaria,</hi>
whose contrary Positions
imply a contradiction) they would
know, that to demand this kind
of evidence of the truth of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Gospel, is to be absurdly
injudicious, and to act contrary to
the Reason of mankind.</p>
                  <p>For seeing we may not with ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
suppose this principle to be
advanced only for the destruction
of Religion, and the ruine (or at
least undeniable hazard) of the
Souls of men; We ought to believe
that these Philosophers intend this
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60674:66"/>
as a General Maxim; <q>that (in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
at least of moment) men
ought not to adventure to act,
but upon clear and undeniable
evidence,</q> and (speaking pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly)
that wise men ought to
believe nothing at all. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us suppose this for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
principle, and consider what
will follow.</p>
                  <p>Setting aside the knowledge of
the Affections of a few Lines and
Numbers, is not all learning to
be cast away? Must not the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil

any other Person, either ever did,
or possibly could, perform any
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60674:67"/>
one action, upon such evidence,
as these men require concerning the
truth of the stories of the Scripture;
then to reject them for want of such
evidence, is repugnant to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of mankind.</p>
                  <p>I proceed therefore to my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
assertion, that the Belief
of the Divine Authority of the
Scriptures is most agreable to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                  <p>That the Divine Authority of
all the Scriptures of the Old and
New Testament, are undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
concluded from supposition
of the truth of the Relation or Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of matters of fact in the
New Testament, I have already
shewn. And that the rejection
of all History is against the Reason
of mankind is evident, because all
mankind receive some History or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
wherefore I shall briefly shew,</p>

in the world can justly pretend

any advantage above that of the
New Testament.</p>
                  <p>1. For the credibility of the
Object, and Cognoscibility of
it.</p>
                  <p>1. To say that instances of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Power and wisdom are
impossible,<note place="margin">Ob. sol.</note> is to deny the power
of God and his providence in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
the world: And to say
that such things are incredible, as
are and have been actually believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in all times, and by all sorts
of persons, Jews and Gentiles, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
and Mahometans (a few A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theistical
persons only accepted) is
an absurdity.</p>
                  <p>The History that we speak of,
pretends to no intrigues or Caba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listick
Counsels, or Myisteries of
State, but conteins it self within
the limits of things Visible and
Audible, things that were done or
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60674:68"/>
spoken; so that no History can have
advantage over it, <hi>respectu Objecti.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. As for Knowledge in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverers,
I shall shew it by a brief
Induction.</p>
                  <p>The whole New Testament
consists of the Books of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
Epistles, Acts of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
and the Gospels.</p>
                  <p>The Authors of the Epistles and
the Revelation, in the Narrative
parts of them, deliver the things
done or spoken to or by themselves,
and could not be ignorant of their
own experiences.</p>
                  <p>The Book of the Acts contains
some things done by or to the rest
of the Apostles, but chiefly the
concernments of <hi>Paul;</hi> and it was
written by <hi>Luke,</hi> who was an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
Companion of <hi>Paul,</hi> and
intimately conversant with the rest
of the Apostles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:60674:69"/>For the things Related in the
Gospel of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> he saith they
were delivered to him by those who
from the beginning were <hi>Eye wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi>
of the works, <hi>and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the Word,</hi> and his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
agrees with the other Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists.</p>
                  <p>The Gospel of St. <hi>Mark</hi> hath
nothing which is not in St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
or St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and was dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the Head of the
Apostles.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Matthew</hi> was an Apostle, and
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Bosom Apostle of
Christ. The Apostles were chosen
by him for Witnesses of his Words
and Actions, they were with him
from the beginning of his Ministry,
continued with him till his death,

                     <hi>That which they had heard, which

they had looked on, which their hands

                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:60674:70"/>They have left behind them va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
instances of their simplicity
and Godly sincerity in represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their failings to the world,<note place="margin">1 Thes. 2. 3. 4.</note> and
of candour and ingenuity in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing
the dictates of their
own Reason from the inspirations
of the Holy Spirit: <hi>I speak by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
not by commandment of the
Lord: This say I, not the Lord;</hi> Thus
it is <hi>according to my judgment &amp;c.</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>But besides all this, let the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be estimated according to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
reason: If these men did
devise a Fable and impose it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the world, what end could
they propound to themselves in
so doing? was there any profit
in being destitute of all things?
or pleasure in being persecuted, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
and tormented? or honour
in being counted Fools and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:60674:70"/>
Before they began to publish the
Stories whereof we speak, their
Master was gone, and all worldly
hopes were gone away with him:
If they were not bound in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and in Spirit; what obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had he laid upon them to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and suffer for his honour as
they did?</p>
                  <p>To omit the severity of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
to them, He called them

<hi>and followed him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this they did (clearly and
plainly) believing that he was to
be a Great Temporal Prince, and
in hopes of preferment under
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60674:71"/>
him. In this Expectation they
continued to the last minute of
his conversation with them upon
Earth, and he permitted them so
to do.</p>
                  <p>Their last words to him were
delivered in this question,<note place="margin">Act. 1. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Lord
wilt thou at this time restore the
Kingdom unto Israel?</hi> Of the thing
it self they never doubted, they
only desire to be informed of the
time,</p>
                  <p>Now after so long expectation?
Consider his Answer.</p>
                  <p>His Answer was this, <hi>It is not for
you to know the times,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but ye shall
receive power when the Holy Ghost is
come upon you, and ye shall be witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of me unto the utmost parts of the
earth;</hi> and immediately he vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away.</p>
                  <p>Was this an answer to their
Question? or a satisfaction to their
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60674:71"/>
expectation? Was this an Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
laid upon them? If he had
not sent down the Holy Ghost, this
would have moved them indeed,
but it would have been to rage and
indignation; this would have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
them indeed, but it would
have been to detest and abhor the
name and memory of him that had
abused them. But for the honour
of his name, not their own, they
did and suffered all things, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in it. An irrefragable argument
of their sincerity in the things which
they delivered</p>
                  <p>3. Of the internal Arguments
for the belief of History, there
remains only the Consideration
of the way and manner of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
                  <p>Histories then carry their own

                  <p>At <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee</hi> he turned Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                  <p>So likewise for the Apostles.

are so cirumstantiated in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
that if false they might
have been very easily contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>But besides all these, this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60674:74"/>
contains a Narration of things
done and said, not only by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
well affected but by <hi>Herod</hi>
and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and the Roman
Governours, by the Pharisees, the
Scribes, the High Priests, and the
<hi>Sanhedrim;</hi> all of them Enemies
both to the Historians and the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story;
and if any of these things had
had been convicted of falshood,
would not the credit of the whole
Gospel have (at once) been utterly
overthrown?</p>
                  <p>I conclude therefore, that in
respect of internal Arguments for
belief, no History hath, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
can have any advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the History of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.</p>
                  <p>2. As for External Arguments,
I can but name them. Though

against the story (so exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60674:74"/>
as you have heard) though

all the rest <hi>intra unius hominis aetatem,</hi>
yet no man could ever convince
them of falshood.</p>
                  <p>The stories were received by

                  </p>
                  <p>For the Gospel like Leaven or
Fire from Heaven, seised upon all
that stood before it; it leaven'd
Cities, Islands, Castles, Councils,
Camps,<note place="margin">Tert Ap. 37.</note> the Tribes and Decuries,
the Palaces, Senate, Pleading-pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>It took possession of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Wise, the greatest and
noblest Wits of the Eastern and
Western Nations: It raised up
Philosophers to confound the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
and noble Orators to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the Rhetorick wherewith
it was opposed.</p>
                  <p>Against <hi>Celsus</hi> it excited <hi>Origen,</hi>
against <hi>Porphyrie Apollinarius,</hi> and
<hi>Methodius;</hi> against <hi>Porphyrie</hi> and
<hi>Hierocles, Lactantius</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi>
(besides what was written <hi>sparsim
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60674:82"/>
Ierom, Augustine, Cyril, &amp;c.</hi>) It
set up <hi>Chrysostom</hi> against <hi>Libanius,
Prudentius</hi> against <hi>Symmachus</hi> and
the Rhetoricians.</p>
                  <p>And as it spread it self large and
high, so where it took possession,
it took a deep possession, <hi>Quantum
verticeâ€”tantum radice:</hi> Those that
received it truly, received it in the
love thereof, it took possession of
their hearts: I penetrated their
spirits, and took its lodging in the
inmost recesses of the soul. The
Contents of these Books was their
most precious Pearl, and they hid
it in their heart. The Books them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
were their greatest worldly
treasure, and rather than they would
deliver them to be burned, they
chose to suffer the loss of Honour,
Liberty, Estate, Wives, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
nay even Life it self. When <hi>Di
oclesian</hi> required the Scriptures that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60674:82"/>
they might be burned, In one
Province <hi>(Egypt)</hi> in one Month
17000 persons chose rather to dye
than to deliver them:<note place="margin">Eus l. 8. c. 3.</note> In compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of these they counted not
their lives dear to them; the love
of them was stronger than Death,
many waters could not quench it,
neither could the flouds drown
it. This was <hi>Testimonium, Rei,</hi>
and an advantage above all other
Histories, or Writings in the
World.</p>
                  <p>2. Moreover they had <hi>Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium
Dei.</hi> Indeed all that is already
spoken is an evidence of a Divine
assistance: But more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
God gave Testimony to these
Books, by

                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:60674:83"/>1. The Gospel which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein,
was the power of God to
every true Believer. That which
no Institution in Philosophy,<note place="margin">Vide Orig. c. Cels. l 3.</note> nor
Initiation in the Mysteries of any
of the Gods, was ever able to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish,
that was every where
atchieved by the belief of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
in a moment. Like a charm
from Heaven, it stilled the passions,
and mortified the lusts of men.
What a Beadroll doth <hi>Paul</hi> reckon
up in the <hi>Corinthans:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>But ye are

but ye are justified, in the Name
of the Lord Iesus, and by the spirit
of our God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding all the calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
thrown upon Believers,<note place="margin">Lact. de sals. sap. l. 3. c 26.</note> and the
prejudice wherewith they were
loaded, the unpropitious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucting
world were forcibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that the Believers of these
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:60674:83"/>
Books were effectually taught to
<hi>deny ungodliness and worldly lusts,</hi>
and <hi>to live soberly, righteously, and
godly in this present world:</hi> through
the cloud of ignominy wherewith
they were encompassed, their <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
broke forth as the light,</hi> and
their <hi>just dealing as the noon day;</hi> the
piety, loyalty, justice, charity, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity,
patience, meekness, and
purity of believers of these Books,
convinced the unbelieving world,
that <hi>God was in them of a truth:</hi> for
they <hi>taught as having Authority</hi> and
Power, and <hi>not as</hi> the writings of
other <hi>Scribes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. But beside the operation of
these Books upon the Believers,
God was pleased to give testimony
to them by his co-operation with
them in signs and wonders, and
mighty deeds.</p>
                  <p>The History of the Gospel tells
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60674:84"/>
us, that when Christ was even now
leaving the world, he left this Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy
to believers for confirmation
of the truth of the Gospel; <hi>These
signs</hi> (said he) <hi>shall follow them that
believe;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mar. 16. 17</note> 
                     <hi>In my name they shall cast
out Devils; Speak in new tongues;
Take up Serpents; If they drink any
deadly thing, it shall not hurt them;
They shall lay hands on the Sick, and
they shall recover.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that this was made good,
and that these signs (so long as there
was need) were continued among
Believers, we have as good assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

                  <p>Other Histories and Writings, and
the Authors and Believers of them
can pretend no higher than to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of men, these have the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of God also: <hi>If we believe the
testimony of men, the testimony of
God is greater.</hi> I conclude therefore,
that there is greater Reason to believe
the History of the New Testament
than any other History in the world.</p>
                  <p>The sum of all is this, The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority of the Scriptures is
the great fundamental and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
Principle of Christianity,
which being admitted it stands,
and being removed it presently falls
to the ground.</p>
                  <p>Against this therefore the great
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60674:86"/>
Enemy of Religion in these later
days (under pretence of Reason
and Philosophy) directs his Forces,
and is said to have found a success
very pernicious and deplorable.</p>
                  <p>I humbly conceive that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of the belief of the Divine
Authority of the Scriptures into
the Decrees of Popes, or Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
of Councils with those
who call themselves Roman-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,
into private impulses and
dictates of the Spirit with the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasts,
and into the Laws and
Edicts of Princes and Magistrates
with our new pretenders to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Philosophy, is that engine
whereby the Devil hath prevailed
to scandalize the world, and cast it
into Antiscriptural infidelity.</p>
                  <p>It is for this cause that I have
conceived it requisite (after many
others who have done worthily)
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60674:86"/>
to have recourse (once more) to the
Original Reason of things,<note place="margin">Vide Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los. Essay.</note> and
the common grounds whereupon
mankind doth proceed in matters of
this nature.</p>
                  <p>Where (hoping that I have es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped
the absurdity of begging the
matter in Question, discoursing in
a circle, and the inconveniences of
some other methods) I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to demonstrate: That sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the truth of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
both 1. The Old Testament,
and 2. The New Testament are to
be received as of Divine Authority.</p>
                  <p>3. And supposing matters of fact
to be truly related, the Doctrinal
parts are to be believed.</p>
                  <p>4. For the Historical Relation
of matters of fact, that there is no
ground to dis-believe it.</p>
                  <p>That for the reception of it,
it hath 1. All the advantages
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60674:87"/>
whereof an History is capable.</p>
                  <p>2. Far greater advantages than
any other History.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I conclude, that <hi>All
the Scriptures</hi> (i. e. the Canonical
Books of the Old Testament and
the Books of the New Testament)
<hi>were Given by inspiration of God. Quod
erat demonstrandum.</hi>

OF

                  <epigraph>
                     <bibl>Heb. iii. 12.</bibl>
                     <q>Take heed, brethren, lest

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>I Shall not spend time in
a disputation concerning
the Author of this Epistle,
<hi>viz.</hi> whether it were <hi>Paul,</hi>
or <hi>Barnabas,</hi> or <hi>Luke,</hi> or <hi>Clemens,</hi>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:60674:89"/>
or <hi>Apollos,</hi> &amp;c. but shall with the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> suppose St.

it.</p>
                  <p>If the Author of it be not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
known, this ought not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
from its Authority.</p>
                  <p>Most of the other Epistles have
been acknowledged to be of divine
Authority, because they were
known to have proceeded from
Apostolical writers.</p>
                  <p>This (on the contrary) hath
been concluded to be an Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Epistle, <hi>propter</hi>

                     <hi>Characterem,</hi> by reason of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and Apostolical Spirit, which
to those who have had their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
exercised, hath manifestly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in it.</p>
                  <p>If it were lawful (in this sense)
to <hi>compare spiritual things with spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual;</hi>
I should not fear to affirm,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60674:89"/>
that this Epistle hath in it some pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
advantages, compared with
some other of the Epistles. (Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
I mean, of usefulness,
not of Authority, seeing all of
them issued from the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.)</p>
                  <p>The design of it is General, Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental,
Comprehensive, not
Private, Circumstantial, Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal:
And it hath peculiarly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to the Church two great
treasures. 1. A Compleat Model,
or Systeme, of Christian Divinity.
And 2. the way of that Analogy,
and manner of ratiocination where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the true Spirit, and meaning of
the Types and Prophesies of the
Old Testament is to be found out
and applied.</p>
                  <p>It was directed to the Hebrews;
That is, to those of the Jewish
Nation, who had received the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60674:90"/>
and made a profession of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.
And the main Scope and
design of it, is to preserve the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of Christianity from Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy
and Infidelity.</p>
                  <p>The means used to this purpose
are partly Didactical, and partly
Protreptical; Demonstrating the
truths of the Gospel, and then
urging the professors of those
truths, to be stedfast in the faith,
and to beware of Infidelity.</p>
                  <p>The Method here used is a mixt
method of Doctrine and Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
Dogmatical truths and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical
Exhortations continually
interwoven.</p>
                  <p>He begins with the Great foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of our faith.<note place="margin">Chap. 1.</note> Christ is the
Son of God, the brightness of his
glory; better then the Angels.
Wherefore <hi>if the Word spoken by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
was stedfast,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chap. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>how shall we es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60674:90"/>
if we neglest so great salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the Comparison of Christ
with <hi>Moses</hi> he concludes against
Hardness of heart and Infidelity.<note place="margin">Chap. 3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>He demonstrates the Priesthood
of Christ to be more Excellent then
that of <hi>Aaron;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">5. 6. 7. 8.</note> and in the midst
of his argument, he falls into an
Application, or Corollary, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the dreadful Condition of
them that fall away.</p>
                  <p>This is his design, and method
throughout the Epistle; What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Doctrine he is upon, this is
still the drift and aim of all his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,
namely to preserve the
Professors of Christianity from
Apostacy and Infidelity.</p>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:60674:93"/>In speaking of the Evil of
Infidelity, I shall not discourse at
large, but confine my self to an
enquiry into two pretences, (Which
having been broached in the late
times of Infidelity towards the
King, are said to have operated ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
far towards a general Apostacy
from the faith, and the production
of Infidelity towards God) both
which appealing to the tenor of
the Scriptures, must be examined
by them.</p>
                  <p>The first is of a famous Author,
and it is this, That the Scriptures
do not make Infidelity to be a Sin,
at the time of the delivery of the
Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>The second is of a Writer more
obscure,<note place="margin">2. C. W.</note> but in it self, so agreeable
to the disposition of the present ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
that it hath possessed the
minds of many; it is this; that</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:60674:94"/>Although Infidelity (according
to the Scriptures) in the times of
Christ and his Apostles, were sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and inexcusable; yet in our
times, it is excusable. These are
the pretences to be examined.</p>
                  <p>The Substance of the Gospel,
as it immediately relates to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
duty, is summarily reduced
to the Doctrines and Injunctions
of our Lord Christ, and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.</p>
                  <p>The Author of Leviathan
(cap. 42. pag 286.) tells us in plain
terms, that <q>
                        <hi>We do not read any
where (in the Scriptures) that they
which received not the Doctrine of
Christ, did therein Sin.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And again, that the Injunctions
of Christ, and his Apostles, men
might refuse without sin.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now concerning this assertion, I
cannot chuse but say, that had I
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60674:94"/>
not been acquainted with the
works of that Author, (especially
those relating to religion) I should
exceedingly wonder at it, because
it supposes men never to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Bibles, which is the thing
it would perswade.</p>

                  <p>Our Saviour Christ before his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

                  <p>Yes! these last, it seems, this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
had read, and as his manner
is, thinking he could accomodate
an answer to these, he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced

To these he saith that they import

only a non-remission of the sins
committed against the Laws of
their Countrey; (that they should
dye in them;) but that they do not
evince any sinfulness to be in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity;
Wherefore I must crave
licence to proceed.</p>
                  <p>The Apostle in the 21 of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
Revelations,<note place="margin">Rev. 21. 8.</note> gives a Catalogue of

are to have their <hi>portion in that lake

                  </p>
                  <p>But it may be, perhaps,<note place="margin">Obj. 1.</note> that the

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 20</note> And of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

                  </p>
                  <p>Consider but the story, from
whence the Exhortation of the
Text arises. How God was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
through unbelief. The text
tells us, that he <hi>was Moved,</hi> he
<hi>was Tempted,</hi> he <hi>was Grieved,</hi> he
<hi>was Provoked,</hi> till <hi>he sware in his
wrathâ€”</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The words are taken out of the
95 Psalm,<note place="margin">Psalm. 95.</note> to which the 78. is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel.</hi>
They were <hi>(saith the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist)</hi>
a stubborn and rebellious Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration;
They tempted God, and spoke
against him, Therefore the Lord heard
this and was wroth: So a fire was
kindled against Iacob, and anger against
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60674:99"/>
Israel; Because they believed not in
God, and trusted not in his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionâ€”
When God heard this, he was worth,
and greatly abhorred Israel, he gave
way to his Indignation, wrath, anger,
displeasure and Iealousy.</p>
                  <p>I conceive now the first Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
to be stated, viz. Whether
(according to the tenor of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
Infidelity were sinful and
dangerous, in the time of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
of the Scriptures: I proceed
to the second Question, <hi>viz.</hi> (How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it was in ancient times)</p>
                  <p>2. Whether Infidelity, be not in
such times as ours Excusable?</p>
                  <p>My meaning is this: Whether
(speaking according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
grounds, and reason) Now
that Miracles, extraordinary gifts
and Prophesies are ceased, Infidelity
be not become Excusable (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60674:99"/>
it might be Sinful and inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
during the time when Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies
and Miracles were in use?)</p>
                  <p>The first verse of this Epistle
(to the Hebrews) tells us what
powerful and noble motives to
believe, God had afforded to the
Fathers.</p>
                  <p>God himself was pleased to
speak to them, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>, at
sundry times, and in divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
                  <p>In the times of the Patriarchs,
Judges, Kings, and Prophets, by
the ways of Visions, Dreams,
Voices, Similitudes, Urim, and
by divers miracles and wonders.</p>
                  <p>So likewise, for those that are
here exhorted; About the time of
the Writing of this Epistle, God
had spoken to them by his Son
(the brightness of his Glory, the
image of his person) And by the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60674:100"/>
Apostles, to whom also he bare
Witness, by mighty signs and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
by divers miracles and gifts of
the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>Now that such men as these, who
had so great advantages to bring
them to believe, should be severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
punished for Infidelity, I am
perswaded there is hardly any
man but thinks it very just and
reasonable.</p>
                  <p>That such as had seen the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of God, in <hi>Egypt</hi> and the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
so manifestly miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
so often repeated, and yet
for all this would not believe, that
their Carcasses should fall in the
Wilderness.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi>
who had known the miracles
which had been done by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
should think to Cousen
the Apostles: it deserved the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:60674:100"/>
Judgment that befel them.</p>
                  <p>As for our selves had we lived
in times of Miracles or Prophesies,
we doubt not but we should have
believed. Or, as <hi>Philip</hi> said, shew
us the father, and it sufficeth. Could
we but once see a miracle, or
talk with one returning from the
dead; it should suffice, we would
believe.</p>
                  <p>But seeing it is now many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of years, since these things
are ceased, and we have nothing
left us, <hi>Praeter miraculorum famam;</hi>
If we shall not believe the Gospel;
by some it is openly pretended,
and by many it is secretly imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that, in this case we may be
Excused.</p>
                  <p>I could wish that the time would
serve, clearly to rid away this
phantasm; In order to it, I shall
briefly doe three things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:60674:101"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Shew that this Phantastical
imagination is no new inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but that it hath of old, been
the conceit of abominable Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2<hi>ly.</hi> I shall inquire a little into
the grounds of this Conceit, and
shew the mistake of those sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
into which it is resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3<hi>ly.</hi> I shall shew, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
(Knowing the thoughts of
men) hath taken particular care
to prevent this Imagination; and
hath clearly decided the matter in
Question.</p>
                  <p>1. Though the present age be
fruitful in inventions tending this
way, yet this hath been Anticipated
by the Wits of former times</p>
                  <p>In the 11 of <hi>Luke</hi> 47.<note place="margin">Luc. 11. 47.</note> We find
the Scribes and Pharises, <hi>building
the Sepulchres of the Prophets, whom
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60674:101"/>
their fathers had killed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we would know, what they
pretended,<note place="margin">Matth. 23. 30.</note> in so doing, we shall
find it in the parallel place of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew.
They said, if we had been in
the days of our fathers, we would not
have been partakers with them, in the
blood of the Prophets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That these men, did not believe
the Prophets, it is manifest; Christ
tells them, <hi>if they had believed the
Prophets, they would have believed
him; for they wrote of him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that they would have believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Prophets, (and not have
murthered them) had they lived
in their times, this they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
and it is very probable they
had that opinion.</p>
                  <p>Yes Verily! had they lived in
the days of Miracles and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
they would have believed,
the very conceit which is now Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:60674:102"/>But the Truth is, these men were
abominable Hypocrites, and the
cause of their Unbelief, was not
the want of miracles and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
but Carnal prejudice, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
and the Vile affections of
their hearts. Did not Christ work
miracles? Was not he that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
which was to come? Yet
they took him, and with wicked
hands they slew him, and brought
upon themselves the bloud of all
the Prophets.</p>
                  <p>But 2<hi>ly.</hi> If we shall examine the
bottom of this fancy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
it into its Principles, we
shall find that it supposes these
things.</p>
                  <p>1. That the want of the sight
of miracles, is sufficient to Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
unbelief.</p>
                  <p>2. That to live in the very age
of miracles, is apter to create be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60674:102"/>
then to be born and educat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in a believing nation, after
the world hath been convinced
by the miracles of former times
(which is our Case.)</p>
                  <p>3. That the bare sight of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
is of it self alone, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to create belief, in every person
that should see them.</p>
                  <p>Of which suppositions, the first
is contrary to common Reason,
and the two later are contrary to
Scriptural Reason, and to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of the world.</p>
                  <p>1. If the want of the sight of
miracles were enough to justifie
Infidelity, then for every <hi>Dogma</hi>
to be believed, Every Individual
person, were to expect the sight
of miracles; which if it should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
the wonder should cease, and
miracles become no miracles, by the
frequency of the performances of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60674:103"/>
them, and so they would be inept
to create belief.</p>
                  <p>Every work of nature, is in it
self a miracle; Who would not
think it easier to recover a man,
(who had all his parts and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
already formed,) from the
dead, then from that liquid prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
whereof <hi>Iob</hi> speakes, to raise
up <hi>flesh and skin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job. 10 10.</note> 
                     <hi>bones and finews:</hi>
to advance an understanding crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
capable of adoring or blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming
the maker of him? Yet
that is a miracle, and this is none,
only through the rarity of one, and
frequency of the other.</p>
                  <p>Again, if every one were to see
miracles,<note place="margin">Ic. 20. 29.</note> the merit of faith would
be taken away. <hi>
                        <q>Iesus said unto
Thomas, because thou hast seenâ€”
thou hast believed, Blessed are they
that have not seen, yet they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</q>
                     </hi>
This for the first supposition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:60674:103"/>2. The second is this, that to
live in the very age of miracles,
is apter to create a belief, then to
live in a believing nation a good
time after the times of Miracles.</p>
                  <p>But, contrary to this, we have
instances both in Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.
After near 4000 years, how
pertinaciously do the Jews adhere
to <hi>Moses,</hi> against whom their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Murmured, and rebelled, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the sight of all his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles;
and when he had wrought
that great miracle upon <hi>Corah</hi> and
for his rebellion, the next day they
rebelled again.</p>
                  <p>And we find now all the whole
world, (especially the wiser part)
Converted to Christianity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Apostles complain of the
paucity of professors, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity
of the Jews, in the Age
of Christ and his Apostles, was so
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:60674:104"/>
great and resolute that it hath a fatal
operation upon that nation unto
this day.</p>
                  <p>I am sensible, that in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of later ages with the days
of miracles, I may be thought
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>, and to advance a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox,
where that I may not lean
on my own understanding, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you to consider our Saviours
decision of the Question which we
have in hand.</p>
                  <p>I suppose, I may take it for
granted, that the condition of the
Jews in our Saviours time, was
in respect of <hi>Moses,</hi> the same
(as to the matter in Question)
with our Condition in respect of
Christ.</p>
                  <p>The tradition of the law, was
accompanyed with mighty Signs
and wonders. And so likewise the
tradition of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:60674:104"/>In the times succeeding <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
God for a Season continued the
sensible manifestation of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
by miracles. So he did
likewise in the times succeeding
Christ.</p>
                  <p>But before the time of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
both miracles and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
had a long time ceased.<note place="margin">P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>We
see not our Tokens</hi> (saith the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist)
<hi>there is not one Prophet left;</hi> as
it is with us at this day</p>
                  <p>Onely, they had the books of
<hi>Moses</hi> and the prophets, Just so
Conveighed and propounded to
them, as our scriptures have been
to us.</p>
                  <p>So that, if the Question be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
concerning those Jews; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the present miracles of Christ,
or the complexion of Motives
which they had, to induce them
to believe the writings of <hi>Moses,</hi>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:60674:105"/>
were apter to create belief, It is
the same with our Question, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the living in the time of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
or our Motives; are more
powerful to believing. To deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
which Question; we may
observe; That the Apostles after
the sight of all our Saviours mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
continued in unbelief, till
he had opened unto them the
Scriptures, of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.
That after many miracles,
he refers the Jews to the searching
of the Scriptures; (bringing them
<hi>Ã  notiori ad ignotius.</hi>) And in the
5 of <hi>Iohn</hi> and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>7.<note place="margin">John 5. 47.</note> he decides
this Question by another <q>If ye

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much concerning the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
supposition.</p>
                  <p>3. The third is this, that the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:60674:105"/>
sight of miracles, is of it self alone,
sufficient to bring every person to
believing.</p>
                  <p>We ought indeed to own it, to
the eternal glory of our blessed
Redeemer, that the Faith of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
is founded upon his Miracles
as well as on his Doctrine, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
And he himself tells the
Jews, that <hi>if he had not done</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
<hi>they should not have had sin</hi>
(<hi>i e.</hi> the sin of Infidelity.<note place="margin">Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Now to dream of miracles, and
hanker after them; or to think
to Excuse our Infidelity, for want
of the sight of them, (as if that
alone would certainly make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
of us all,) it argues that we
have been sloathful readers of the
Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>It hapned to our Saviours mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
as it did to his Preaching;
according to his parable of the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60674:106"/>
sower. Some of them lighted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

of believing. Others fell by the

among the Thorns.</p>
                  <p>The prepossession of their minds,
by an expectation of a temporal

The Cares of the World, and
deceitfulness of riches; The plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures

                     </gap> rooted in the hearts
of a perverse and froward Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
prevailed against the sight
of miracles; and none were more
pervers and resolute unbelievers,
then some of those, who had the
Advantage of this great argument

                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:60674:106"/>
If the sight of Miracles alone,
were sufficient to produce belief,
in all kinds of Spectators, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Scribes and Pharisees, (who
by their learning were able to
Judge of a miracle,) the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen

to an issue.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it were granted to these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60674:108"/>
to see a miracle, what kind
of miracle would they chuse, to
convince their understandings, and
settle them in religion? We are
here I confess <hi>in loco conjecturali,</hi>
and no man can tell what miracle
another man would chuse, but I am
perswaded, that which most men
would agree upon, as most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
to that purpose whereof
we are speaking, would be this;
that to assure them of the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
of the Soul and of the rewards
and punishments of the world
to come, and to satisfie their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
in some other doubts and
scruples; They might once be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to see and converse with some
one, that might rise from the dead,
who might resolve their Questions,
concerning the condition of those
that are in <hi>Hades.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. I say then, that our Saviour
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:60674:108"/>
who knew, what was in man, and
needed not that any one should tell
him, foreseeing this Phantastical
conceit, hath shewed the folly of it,
and preoccupated this vain resort.</p>
                  <p>In the 16 of <hi>Luke</hi> 27. <hi>Dives</hi> makes

                     <hi>that he

which these men dream of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> refers them to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which were in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
recommended to them as our
Scriptures are to us. <hi>They have Moses
and the Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>let them hear
them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He saith unto him, Nay father Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
but if one went to them from the
dead, they would believe.</p>
                  <p>And he <hi>(Abraham)</hi> said If they
hear not Moses and the Prophets,
neither will they be perswaded though
one rose from the dead.</p>

                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:60674:109"/>
This I take to be a clear and a full
determination of the matter in
Question;<note place="margin">Joh. 11.</note> And if any one should
magine, that this determination
was but Conjectural, Our Saviour
afterward tries the Experiment, and
raises another <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead.</p>
                  <p>What was the effect of this mans
coming from the dead, did it Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the High Priest or the Scribes,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="53"/> the rulers or the people; nay, but <hi>from
that very day they took counsel together
how they might put Iesus to death.</hi> And
<hi>the Chief Priests consulted, how they
might put Lazarus to death also.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon these Considerations we
may infallibly Conclude, that Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
in Such times as ours, is no
more excusable, then it was in the
days of Christ or his Apostles; the
times of mir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>So much of the first Suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in the Caveat of the Text, the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60674:109"/>
Sinfulness of Infidelity in General,
at all times, And the Inexcusable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in our times, which makes it
our Duty to take heed of it.</p>
                  <p>I pass to the second supposition,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/>
concerning the Danger of falling
into it, which makes it our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
and Interest to beware
of it. For if this be clear, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
will be powerful, <hi>take
heed brethren, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Danger of falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
infidelity is in it self so conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous,
and made so sensible by
every day's experience, that I wish
the proof of it were difficult, so as
to Justify a studious and laborious
demonstration of it.</p>
                  <p>At once to shorten my discourse,
and to remove the suspicion of any
Satyrical reflexion upon those that
hear me; I shall shew, that the
Greatest Advantages, have not
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:60674:110"/>
preserved the best of men, from
sometimes falling into Infidelity.
<hi>Take heed therefore, brethren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The greatest Helps and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
against unbelief, I conceive
to be these ensuing.</p>
                  <p>1. Evidences of Gods presence.
2. Or these lighting on a good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.
3. At least upon the
Ablest of men. 4. Such as have
held Communion with God. 5. Or
have been eminent for the habit
and exercise of faith. 6. Or these
with warnings to prevent the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of falling. 7. And those reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Yet all these have not preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
good men from sometimes fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
A word of each.</p>
                  <p>1. First then, to begin with the
persons in the Context, What
greater Evidences of the Presence
of God can be Imagined, then they
enjoyed! In <hi>Egypt,</hi> in their passage
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:60674:110"/>
over the red Sea; in the Wilderness,
<q>
                        <hi>my presence,</hi> saith God, <hi>shall go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with you,</hi>
                     </q> They were conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a Pillar of a Cloud, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they
were supported, and Corrected by
Visible and palpable instances of
Gods power and presence: Yet
they tempted and grieved the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, by their Infidelity, for
<hi>they believed not for all his Wonderous
Works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. But these Jews were a dull
and stupid people. If God should
once manifest himself, to a wise
and understanding person (such as
we take our selves to be) We may
think it impossible to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>all into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</p>
                  <p>I suppose it will be no disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to these Objectors, to say,
that <hi>Solomon</hi> might be as Wise and
Knowing, as Wary and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
as they. And as for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:60674:111"/>
of Gods presence, the
Scripture tells us Expresly, that
<hi>God appeared to him at Gibeon:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Kin. 3. 5.</note> Where
he made a promise to him which
he performed.</p>
                  <p>Yet <hi>Solomon</hi> fell into the grossest
Infidelity; to think there were
Gods and Goddesses, To <hi>worship
Ashtaroth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and Milcom the Abomination of
the Ammonites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. But it may be yet Objected,
that <hi>Solomon</hi> did this in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of his years, and his Dotage
upon his Idolatrous wives, which
turned away his heart, but that
it co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ld not have proceeded from
him before his understanding was
impaired</p>
                  <p>Behold then a greater then <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon!</hi>
even <hi>Adam</hi> in his full
strength, when he was newly made
after the similitude of God, a little
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60674:111"/>
lower then the Angels. God se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times appeared to him in the
Garden; Yet he fell through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
and drew all his posterity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his ruine.</p>
                  <p>4. But <hi>Adam,</hi> though he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Nature, yet he wanted
Grace, whereby he might have held
communion with God; which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been once enjoyed, would for
ever have kept him from infidelity,
or deliberate sin, which always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from it.</p>
                  <p>Consider then the case of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 16. 13. Psal. 89. 4.</note>
of whom it is said, that <hi>the

                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> That <hi>God</hi> himself <hi>made a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with him, and Sware unto him
by his holiness, that he would not fail
him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as for <hi>David,</hi> who was like
unto him, for Devotion and Zeal,
for spiritual Communion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60674:112"/>
with God? He was <hi>the
sweet singer of Israel;</hi> and how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
do we find his Spirit inebriat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and transported in the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
of his divine and ravishing
enjoyments?</p>
                  <p>Yet we find him falling from all
this height; and great and terrible
was his fall; he went <hi>mourning for
it all his days,</hi> and <hi>bowed down his
head continually.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. But perhaps it may be thought,
that though <hi>David</hi> was an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
man, yet seeing his Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
lay not in the gift of Faith, but
in Zeal, or in some other Grace,
the danger may not yet be so very
considerable.</p>
                  <p>Behold then even <hi>Abraham,</hi> the
Darling of the almighty, who <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
with God as a man converseth
with his Friend:</hi> to whom God
communicated his presence in
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60674:112"/>
Dreams, in Visions, in Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>He was imbued with the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
of Faith; he exerted it in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
exercise; he manifested it
in the heroical degree; so that
he became <hi>the Father of the Faithful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet once we find him offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(tripping) at this stone of
stumbling; Equivocating through
unbelief.</p>
                  <p>6. But all these instances were
during the Ancient Dispensation,
when the Communication of the
presence of God was more Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure;
before the fulness of time was
come, when <hi>the word was made flesh</hi>
and <hi>dwelt amongst men, and they saw
his glory as the glory of the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Son of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides, we do not find that
they were particularly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
warned of their danger,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60674:113"/>
which may lessen the Wonder of
the fall.</p>
                  <p>Consider then the Case of <hi>Peter,</hi>
the first of the Apostles. He had
been closely conversant with Christ
during all the time of his Ministry;
Was a witness of his miracles, saw
his Transfiguration, heard <hi>the
Voyce which came to him from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
glory,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>saying this is my beloved
Sonâ€”</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for his faith; he it was, that
made that confession, upon which
the Christian Church is founded.
And Christ had <hi>prayed for him that
his faith should not fail.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was a Valiant man; and he
undertook that though he died, he
would neither forsake nor deny
his Master.</p>
                  <p>When Christ forewarns him
plainly and punctually, that his faith
would fail him, that very night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:60674:113"/>
a certain hour; So that it was
impossible he should be surprised.</p>
                  <p>You know his Undertakings,
and of his Failings it is unnecessary
to speak.</p>
                  <p>7. I know nothing now that
can be alledged, against the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
propensity of all men to Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
but this; that <hi>Peter</hi> was now

                     </gap>ingle and alone, that he failed only
this time; when he was invironed
with Bills and Staves, and in Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of his Life.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore let us call to mind
the Case of all the Apostles, in
the great Foundation of our Faith,
the Article of Christs Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
when these temptations were
away.</p>
                  <p>The resurrection of the dead was
in those times so commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
that it was conceived of
Christ, that he was <hi>one of the Old
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:60674:114"/>
Prophets risen from the Dead,</hi> and
<hi>Herod said, he was Iohn the Baptist ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
from the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the resurrection, the Apostles
had seen Experiments, in <hi>Lazarus,</hi>
and in the bodies of the Saints
which arose.</p>
                  <p>Concerning Christs resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
how plainly and often were
they forewarned? After he was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,
how often were they told of
it? Yet how grossely and often did
they fail?</p>
                  <p>In they 8 of <hi>Mark</hi> 31 Christ tells

                  <p>Of the same kind with our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours,
some they performed, by
means having an appearance of
greater strangeness, (Christ healed

But one great thing there was,
wherein they exceeded; The Great
and Manifest, and frequent Effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the Spirit, the Reception
of it upon themselves, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of it to others, by
Prayer, Preaching, Laying on of
Hands; By these it was that the
unbelieving world was convinced,
and even <hi>Simon Magus</hi> himself;
It is by the power and Vertue of
those effusions that we are here met
together at this time, that the
World continues Christian at this
day. And these are some of those
standing means and Arguments,
whereby the proneness of our
hearts to infidelity may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come;
and faith may be begotten,
confirmed, recovered at this day:
These are therefore to be revolved,

                     <hi>Exhort one another dayly.</hi> To
come therefore to a Conclusion.</p>
                  <p>My text it self is an Application,
by way of Exhortation; Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are enforced by Reasons of
Duty and Concernment, and these
I have hitherto endeavoured to lay
before you.</p>
                  <p>If indeed there were no Sinfulness
in Infidelity, Or, if in such times
as ours, it were excusable. If there
were no danger of falling into it,
or no means left to remedy or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it; it would then indeed be to
little purpose to Exhort men to
beware.</p>
                  <p>But if the state of all these things
is otherwise, if that be plain and
evident; agreeable to Scripture, to
Reason and to Experience; if the
Speaker hath not beaten the Air,

                  <p>THE great and general design
of the Ministry and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Gospel, is to
bring men to Christianity; not in
the outward profession, but in the
true spirit and power thereof; to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:60674:126"/>
the end they may be justified and
sanctified, and finally saved through
Christ for ever.</p>
                  <p>The Particular design of this
Dayes Observation is to <hi>humble our
selves under the mighty hand of God,</hi>
in Consideration of his Judgments,
especially that late one in consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Fire the Ancient and
noble <hi>Metropolis</hi> of this Nation;
and to endeavour to appease the
wrath of God gone out against us.</p>
                  <p>To compass both these designs
(whereof the later is subordinate
to the former) I know no better
expedient, than to reason a while
upon that important argument sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
in the Text.</p>
                  <p>Who can think upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration
of our late Glorious City,
and not call to mind the great and
ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ible day of Judgment?</p>
                  <p>Who can think seriously of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:60674:126"/>
Judgment, and not be compelled
to come in, (driven to Christianity)
that he may be <hi>saved from the wrath
to come?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The great Instructor and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Christian Preachers
(he who saith of himself, that
<hi>Christ sent him to preach and not to
baptize</hi>) found no means so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to perswade men to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
as to reason upon this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
as first to lay before them
the terror of Judgment, and then
(whilst that was warm upon their
hearts) to make them a tender of
the Gospel. This is the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
and use the Apostle makes
of the Doctrine of the Text.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>We
must all appear</hi> (saith he) <hi>before the
Iudgment-seat of Christ,â€”Knowing
therefore the terrour of the Lord, we
perswade men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon these Considerations I
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:60674:127"/>
shall hope for the pardon of this
Noble Auditory, if (without
affectation of Science) I shall, in
a practical and familiar way of
reasoning, indeavour to imitate our
Apostle in this particular.</p>
                  <p>If in the mean time it will be
irksome and unpleasant to hear of
the Judgment to come, we shall
do well to consider what it will be
to undergo it; we shall do well
to reflect upon our Souls, and
search out the ground of this avers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
Is it because we do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
a Judgment to come? or that
we our selves shall be brought to
Judgment? Is it because we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
consider, who it is before
whom me must appear? or, what
things will be charged on our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count?
Is it because we are so far
gone in our arrears that it is to no
purpose to call these things into
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:60674:127"/>
our remembrance?â€”What ever
it be, we may perhaps hear of that
which may meet with and remove
the prejudice and imposture that is
upon us. It is neither our Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
nor Infidelity that will <hi>make
void the Truth of God.</hi> Whether
we will hear, or Whether we will
forbear, the Words which I have
read remain firm and unalterable,
and they clearly contain these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions:
<list>
                        <item>1. There is a Judgment to come.</item>
                        <item>2. Thou shall be brought to

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> I. First then, <hi>There is a Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to come.</hi> This is no Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
invention found out to fright
thee from thy pleasures; this is no
Engine of State devised to keep you
in a subordination to your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;
this is no vain Thunder or
foolish fire, to affright you in to a
blind obedience, but it is the Tenor
of the Scripture of the voyce of
God, <hi>King Agrippa believest thou the
the Prophets? I know that thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievest,</hi>
(saith St. <hi>Paul.</hi>) Brethren
do we believe the Scriptures? I
hope we do believe them; This we
do all profess to believe, so often
as we repeat our Creed; and I hope
the dissolution of our times has not
yet shatter'd that foundation of our
faith, the ground work of our
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:60674:128"/>
hopes, even the Salvation of our
souls. Surely there are rewards for
men; <hi>doubtless there is a God which
judgeth the earth.</hi> What though
the foundations of the world be
out of course, the pillar of Faith
remains unshaken; <hi>the Rod of the
ungodly shall not for ever rest upon the
back of the righteous:</hi> I desire to
make a little use of your faith for
that which anon will be obtained
from your reason. There is a
Judgment to come, it's as sure
as death, nay far surer; they shall
be judged which shall not dy, they
have been judged which could not
dy, the one at the end, the other
at the beginning of the world.</p>
                  <p>There is a Particular and a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Judgment; the one at the
dissolution of the lesser, the other
of the greater world; the one at the
hour of death, the other at the day
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:60674:129"/>
of Judgment. A Judgment I say,
a strict examination, an exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
a severe sentence; words
which make no thundring noise,
or tragical sound, and so they may
pass our hardned hearts without
any motion; wherefore let us
judge of the tenor and moment of
them by their antecedent signs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Before one of them, the evil days
come: The other is called</hi> the evil
day. <hi>Before one,</hi> Solomon <hi>tells
us, that</hi> the Sun, and the Moon,
and the Light, and the Stars shall be
darkned: <hi>Before the other, a greater
than</hi> Solomon <hi>tells us, that</hi> the Sun
shall be turned into Darkness, and the
Moon into Bloud, and the Stars
shall fall from Heaven. <hi>Before one,</hi>
the Keepers of the House shall tremble,
and the Strong men bow themselves;
<hi>Before the other,</hi> the Mountains
shall quake, and the Powers of Heaven
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:60674:129"/>
shall be shaken: <hi>Before one,</hi> we
shall rise at the voyce of the Bird; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the other,</hi> at the sound of the
Trumpet. <hi>Before one,</hi> the silver
Cord shall be loosed, and the golden
Bowl broken, and the Pitcher broken
at the Fountain, and the wheel broken
at the Cistern: <hi>Before the other, the
silver Zone of the ecliptick, and
the golden Globe of the Sun, the
Orbs, and the Vortices shall be
confounded, (the</hi> wheel within a
wheel) <hi>the</hi> Heavens shall be rivel'd as
a scrowl of Parchment, <hi>and the Earth
and</hi> the Elements shall melt away with
fervant heat. <hi>In the one, the</hi> dust
shall return to the earth as it was, and
and the spirit to God that gave it: <hi>At
the other, the dust shall return
from the earth to be as it was, and
the spirit from God that gave it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Come now and let us reason to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:60674:130"/>Are all these the fore-runners
and symptomes of approaching
Judgment? then why art thou so
drows<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>e O my careless soul, and
why are thou so secure within me?
What strange Lethargy hath seised
on thee? <hi>Awake thou that sleepest,
and Christ shall give the light.</hi> The
time of thy dissolution is coming,
and after death, the Judgment.
Retire therefore a while into thy
self, and commune with thy heart:
Enter thou into thy Closet, and
shut thy Door upon thee: Let us
examine our selves before we come
to that strict Examen: Let us
make a Judgment of our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before we come to Judgment.
Do we believe a Judgment will
come? Then how are we provided
against that Day? Are our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
ready? Art thou able to
stand in Judgment? Shalt thou be
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:60674:130"/>
clear when thou art judged? When
<hi>Paul reasoned</hi> before <hi>Felix concerning
the Iudgment to come, Felix trembled;</hi>
and because it was an unpleasant
argument, <hi>he put him off to an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no doubt but our trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
hearts would gladly put
off these Considerations, and deferr
them to a more convenient season.
Nay! but there is no time so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
as the present, when we
are wrought into some apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Judgment: if we stay till
our present thoughts are over, we
shall again be brought to lose the
apprehension (to forget the import
and moment) of the Judgment;
we shall come again to hear the
Name thereof, and to neglect it as
an idle Noise, and empty Sound.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore not neglect this
opportunity; Let us search our
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:60674:131"/>
seleves to the bottom; Let us make
a discovery of our final Resolution,
and secret Reserves in reference to
Judgment. We profess openly to
believe that Christ shall come with
Glory, to judge both the Quick
and Dead; What are our inward
thoughts in that particular? and
how are we provided against the
Day of Judgment?</p>
                  <p>There is a Judgment to come,
that Judgment terrible, the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
strict, the Condemnation
insupportable, and most of us ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
unprovided; yet for all this,
it's possible it may be avoyded. All
these things are true in Judgments
here below, and we see the proof
of them at every Assizes; yet all
Offenders are not brought to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but many Thieves and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers
escape it: It may be thus
in the Judgment to come; it's
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:60674:131"/>
possible it may be avoidable.</p>
                  <p>A miserable hope, if this be all; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
for <hi>Thon shalt be brought to Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
That's the second Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
                  <p>And it contains the Universality
or Particularity of the Judgment,
(which you please:) thou, and
every man, <hi>singuli generum, &amp; genera

every man of every sort, from <hi>Him

appear before the Iudgment-seat of
Christ.</hi> It <hi>is appointed for all men once

Death shall deliver up our Souls to

our Bodies to the second Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Grave shall deliver up
her spoils, and the bodies of all men,
devoured of Beasts, consumed of
Fire, swallowed by the Sea, scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered

to the four Winds, <hi>in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

be brought to Judgment.</p>
                  <p>And here shall I bewail the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
or inveigh against the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of us Men, that suffer our
selves to be hurried headlong by
the power of our imaginations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the striving of our Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
that suffer our Senses to carry
away the crown from our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and give over our selves
to the impetuous stream of our pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions:
That when we have a full
information, a compleat judgment,
a clear dictate of conscience, we
will suffer all these to be overborn
in us by the <hi>Idola SpecÃ»s, TribÃ»s,
&amp;c.</hi> which are brought into our
imaginations: That having clear
and evident Principles, we can yet
doubt of their immediate conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences;
or whilest we profess an
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:60674:132"/>
universal truth, never descend to
think of the particulars.</p>
                  <p>We know there is a vast diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the things present,
and those to come; and yet we form
our thoughts of those, according
to the analogy of these, deluding
our selves with idle and childish
imaginations. God keeps silence;
we <hi>think he is such an one as we: Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance

                        </gap>sently executed, we set
our hearts to do wickedly.</hi> We profess
that all men must die, and come
to judgment; yet we do not really
believe that we our selves shall dy,
and come to judgment. This is the
fountain of our misery, and the
original of our spiritual miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages:
the discovery of the causes
and remedy whereof, lies deep in
the Philosophy concerning Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature; but the thing it self
is of every days observation: we
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:60674:133"/>
may recount it in these authentical
examples. <hi>David</hi> knew full well
what belong'd to Murder and
Adultery, and what himself had
done in the matter of <hi>Uriah;</hi> yet
he cried not out that he had sinned,
till <hi>Nathan</hi> had charged him, <hi>Thou
art the man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ahab</hi> undoubtedly had read
the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and knew the
guilt of Murder and Oppression;
yet he goes on triumphantly, he
kills, and also takes possession: but
when <hi>Elijah</hi> charges hime home,
<hi>In the field of Iezreel shall Dogs lick
thy blood, even thine,</hi> then he cries
out, <hi>Hast thou found me, O mine
enemy?</hi> (1 Kings 21.) and having
applyed things to his particular, he
<hi>Rent his Cloaths, and put on sackcloth,
he fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and
went softly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Once more: 'Tis likely <hi>Belshaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>
                     <pb n="259" facs="tcp:60674:133"/>
had a general Judgment, and
an universal Maxime in his mind,
That it was unlawful to spoil the
House of God, to plunder those
things which were dedicated to the
Lord, and to debauch in the Bowls
of the Temple, and probably he had
seen the hand-writing of the book
of God to that purpose: yet all this
does not restrain him: But when
the <hi>Fingers write upon the Wall, Mene,
Mene,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>thou art weighed,</hi> &amp;c.
then <hi>his countenance was changed,
and his thoughts troubled him, the
joynts of his loyns were loosed, and his
knees smote one against another.</hi> This
then is the Office of this second
Proposition, it charges us home,
it lays down the Universal, and it
brings it down to the Particular.</p>
                  <p>Thou shalt be brought to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Thy Judgment is unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:60674:134"/>O but then thy Evasion is crossed,
O my stupid Soul! Thou art spoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of thy frivolous ground of
hope: Thou shalt surely be cited,
and thou must appear, if thou refuse
to come thou shalt be brought to
Judgment. Return then again into
thy self, and take a review of thy
condition; what will the issue be of
that Judgment to which thou must
be brought? What hopes are now
remaining that thou shalt not be
condemned? when the <hi>Officers
have haled thee before the Iudge,</hi> that
<hi>thou be</hi> not <hi>delivered to the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If thou art called to Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Canst thou elude thy Judge
by thy wily Answers? or Canst
thou baffle or suborn the Witnesses?
Canst thou work off thy Jury not
to find the Verdict? or bribe the
Judge to favour thee in thy Doom?
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:60674:134"/>
Canst thou withdraw him from
the Rigour of Justice by the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of thy friends, or melt him
into compassion by the loudness of
thy cries, the sadness of thy lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation?
Canst thou procure a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
or Reprieve of thy sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
or appeal from thy Judge
unto another? Canst thou make
an escape from thine Executioner?
Or lastly, Canst thou stoutly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the sentence of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
These are the hopes of men
here brought to Judgement, and
why may not some of them be
mine? No, thou knowest, O trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
heart, all these to be fond
impossibilities, dreams, and sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions
of a childish fancy; if once
this day be over, and that time come,
thy hopes are barely these, that
Omniscience and Wisdom it self
may be deluded by stupidity, that
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:60674:135"/>
Omnipotence and Power it self may
be evaded by poor contemptible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,
that Severity and Justice it
self may be perverted by iniquity;
all this is evident by that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:
<hi>For we must all appear before
the Iudgment seat of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> God will bring thee to Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>And here we are concerned to
raise our thoughts, and employ the
utmost of our attention, lest by the
prejudice which our Idleness hath
brought upon us, <hi>we treasure up
wrath to</hi> our selves <hi>against that day</hi> of
Judgment. 'Tis true, we daily
hear of God, and receive the
names of his Attributes into our
ears, but we pass over his Name
as if he were like to us, and never
bestow so much labour as to attain
to a considerable notion of those
names. O that the God of Heaven
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:60674:135"/>
would afford us here some glimpse
of himself; That he would illustrate
us with some beam of his Majesty;
That he would be pleased to visit

his face? <hi>No man can see my face and
live,</hi> (Exod. 33.) if the <hi>Israelites</hi>
durst not hear him proclaim the
Law, how shall we endure to
hear him denounce the Judgment?
If the Angels veil their faces, not
able to behold his Excellency, how
shall we be affected with his terrors?
If the Cherubims are oppressed
with the sight of his glory, what
shall we be with the sense of his
fury? If we find our selves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
and swallowed up into
inextricable Labyrinths, when we

How at first he <hi>poured thee out like

                  <p>Alas! what could I have done for

extends not to him; if thou sinnest,

be righteous, what receiveth he at thine

need not stand to unfold the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuity,
the stupor and madness of
this evasion. However though these
things shall be urged upon us, they
are not all; these offer themselves
in the consideration of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

to which we were forced to strein

is quite contrary, the Judgment
takes in primarily the ways of the
heart, and the words and actions

let us withdraw a space into

For all the ways of the hearts of

in a Napkin. In outward things,
how thou hast acquired, and how
thou hast managed thine Estate:
How thou hast behaved thy self
in thy Relations publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
in thy charge, and in thy duty.
â€”But the time would fail me to
reckon up a considerable part of the
exercises and objects of the wayes
of the hearts of Men: And now all
these and many more, are but the
simple elements, and common
heads of our account.</p>
                  <p>Consider then, O negligent
and incogitant soul! if thou couldst
reckon up the ways of thy heart,
in any one of these kinds; if thou
couldst call to mind but every idle
word whereof thou must give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
or thy motions upon every
thing thou hast heard, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in any one of these elements,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:60674:143"/>
what thou hast done or else omitted.
Then tell me how wouldst thou
find thy self possessed, and how
wouldst thou be disposed to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Wouldst thou deem it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
or idle to call it betimes to thy
remembrance? Wouldst thou drive
off thy thoughts of it to the time of
sickness, to the hour of death, and
rudely throw thy self upon it?â€”But
then try, and examine all these to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
contemplate a little upon the
mixtures and combinations of
them; these will afford us many
millions of millions of wayes (far
exceeding the varieties of the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
nature, which proceed from
the mixture of fewer elements) so
many as will utterly confound our
thoughts to number. Who can
reckon up the wayes of the hearts
of the children of Men? Who can
understand his errours?</p>

And now, that he that hath the

to maintain, should keep a Register

resort of the treacherous hearts of
men, the grand imposture which
resolves into a species of Atheism
and Infidelity. O but then, if I
shall use the language of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
I must call thee fool and beast,
to doubt of that which is plain and
evident, to disbelieve that which
may be known. This Article con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Judgment to come, is
not a problem of Philosophy to be
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:60674:144"/>
disputed this way and that way with
equal probability; neither is it only
an Article of faith, but it is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of natural Theology, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
speaks of it under terms of
greater evidence St. <hi>Paul</hi> reasoned
with <hi>Felix,</hi> he disputed with the
Philosophers concerning it, he
speaks of the terror of Judgment
under terms of certainty, and of
a kind of Demonstrative evidence;
<hi>Knowing the terror of the Law,
&amp;c.</hi> and hear in the Text, it is not
said, <hi>Think,</hi> or <hi>believe;</hi> But <hi>know
that for all these things God will bring
thee to Iudgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thinks he hath no understanding
may well be compared to the beasts
that <hi>perish.</hi> &amp; so sure as there is a God,
and that man hath an understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:60674:145"/>
                     <hi>That for all these things, &amp;c.</hi> For if
there be a God, he must be infinitely
just; and if so, he must render to
every one according to their actions;
and if not here, then hereafter; and
if so, he must bring them to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>e doth it not here:
The ways of Providence seem to be
promiscuous, <hi>there is a wicked man
to whom it happens according to the way
of the righteous,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccles 8. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>and a righteous man
to whom it happens according to the way
of the wicked. Dives</hi> receives pleasure,
<hi>Lazarus</hi> pain; therefore so sure as
there is a God, there will be a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Again, If man have an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
soul, be must have freedom
in his actions; and if so, he deserves
either good or evil; and if there be
deserts, there must be rewards; and
if there be rewards, there must be a
Judgment. So then, so sure as thou
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:60674:145"/>
art an understanding creature, so
sure there is a Judgment to come.</p>
                  <p>Once more, Reward is answerable
to desert; and desert is only in what
is free; and what is free in man is the
ways of his heart: wherefore they
are to be brought to Judgment, and
if any, then all: for no reason can
be fancied, why some should be
brought to Judgment, and others
not. Wherefore, if it be sure that
God is in Heaven, and that Man
hath an understanding soul, then it
is also sure that for all these things
God will bring thee to Judgment,
that God shall bring to judgment
every secret thing.</p>
                  <p>And now how sure and evident
are these things? more sure and
more plain, if we will attend, than
any other truths in the world; for
there is not any known truth which
doth not evict the truth of these
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:60674:146"/>
things. We know a truth, because
we plainly and evidently understand
the composition or division of the
notions in a Proposition, or the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of a Proposition from some
others; therefore if we know any
truth, we presuppose that we have
souls which understand the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of things, and if souls which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
these notions, then to be
sure they are not bodies, (no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination
of fire and air, and earth,
and wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>er, no disposition of insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
atomes can cause the subject to
apprehend and judge, to reason and
discourse) and if they be no bodies,
then they are not subject to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
It is evident therefore that our
souls are understanding and also
immortal, deserving and capable of
future Judgment.</p>
                  <p>And as evident it is also that there
is a soveraign Power, a God that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:60674:146"/>
and will Judge the Earth.</p>
                  <p>This is not a Rhetorical under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
but a just an measured
truth; there is not any thing in the
world from whence these two may
not be plainly and evidently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
<hi>viz.</hi> a Godhead from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and thine own Immortality
from the discovery of a Godhead.
The world which thou seest, had it
a beginning, or had it not? if it had
a beginning, he is thy God that
made it; if it had no beginning,
then there are past as many myriads
of years as minutes of time, which
is infinitely more absurd to grant,
than to say, thou hast as many hands
as fingers, as many wholes as parts.</p>
                  <p>If then at any time we find our
selves to doubt of these things, it is
not because we are the <hi>beaux esprits,</hi>
or <hi>forts esprits;</hi> our doubting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from dulness, and the want of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:60674:147"/>
that strong reason to which we do
pretend, the things are certain in
themselves and evident. <hi>He is not far
from any one of us, in whom we live,
and move, and have our being;</hi> and
the Light of nature discovered our
Immortality not only to Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
but even to the Heathen
Poets, to him that sung to us, that,
<hi>We are also his off-spring.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that now thy pretences are all
taken off, and every imposture of
the heart discovered.</p>
                  <p>Return then once again into thy
bosome, and take account of thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions.<note place="margin">Applic. general.</note>
The day of the Lord is
coming and stealing upon thee as a
thief in the night, the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the great and terrible day. A
day of darkness and of gloominess,
a day of a whirlwind and a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest,
a day of anguish and tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Where wilt thou hide thy self?
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:60674:147"/>
O that's impossible, <hi>Where shall we go
then from his presence?</hi> shall we <hi>call
to the Mountains to fall upon us?</hi> How
wilt thou appear? O that's intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
<hi>for our God is a consuming fire.</hi>
What wilt thou do when the day of
Judgment comes, and this may be
the hour, this minute thou mayest
be smitten and hurried hence to
Judgment? Thousands have fallen
besides us, and ten thousands at our
right hand, and why may not we
be next?</p>
                  <p>The time of our particular Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
cannot be far away, and why
may we not reasonably apprehend
the approach of the General Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
either of this World, or at
leastwise of this sinful Nation?</p>
                  <p>Our Lord Christ indeed tells us,
that <hi>of the day and hour of the final</hi>
Judgment, <hi>Knoweth no man.</hi> Yet
he hath given us the signs of his
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:60674:148"/>
coming: The Apostles have left us
Characters of the last days, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
have declared the manner
and <hi>apparatus</hi> of the coming of the
Lord to Judgment.</p>
                  <p>We read that when the Disciples
admired the stones and the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of <hi>Herod's</hi> Temple at <hi>Ierusalem;</hi>
Christ told them, <hi>That the day was
coming when there should not be left one
stone upon another:</hi> upon this the
Disciples ask him (privately) three
Questions. 1. <hi>When shall these things
be? 2. What shall be the sign of thy
second coming?</hi> And 3. <hi>of the end of
the World?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the precise moment of
these things, he denies to tell it them;
(Nay, he professes, that as he was
the Son of Man he did not know it.)
But for the other two he conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends
to their curiosity, he tells
them the signs of his coming, and
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:60674:148"/>
of the end of the World, and that
they shall be such as these;</p>

'tis in vain to think of turning from

you, and you shall be saved. Saved
from the fears and horrours of a Guilty Conscience condemned by
its own witness. Saved from the

You shall meet the Lord with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.
We shall be able to stand
with boldness in the Judgment, to

                  </p>
                  <p>This is the way to save our own
souls from perishing, which is the
General design of all our Preaching.
And this is the way to appease the
wrath which is gone out against us;
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:60674:153"/>
and to preserve our Nation from
destruction, which is the particular
and more immediate end of our
present Humiliation, whereof I am

                  <p>THe hand indeed of the Lord
hath been heavy upon us,<note place="margin">Applic. particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</note>
his wrath hath been kindled, it hath
<hi>waxed hot against the Sheep of his

Nation very sore; His Judgments
have been multiplied, his strokes
have been redoubled; and for all
this <hi>his anger is not turned away, but
his hand is stretched out still.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wars and Pestilences, and those
other fore-runners of Christ's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and felt amongst us, and now when
these have not been able to prevail,</p>
                  <p>To awaken a drowsie people, to
rowse up a Lethargic Nation, to
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:60674:153"/>
ferment a people setled upon their
Lees: God has made a new thing
in the midst of us, he hath wrought
a work in our dayes, which makes
the ears of all that hear it to tingle.
A work not to be parallel'd perhaps
in all the circumstances since the
Creation of the World.</p>
                  <p>How hath the Lord covered the
Daughter of our Zion with a cloud in
his anger, and hath cast down from
Heaven to Earth the beauty of Israel,
and remembred not his footstool in the
Day of his Anger? he hath swallowed
up the habitations of his people, he hath
taken away his Tabernacles, and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his places of Assemblies, the Ramparts
and the Walls lament and languish, her
Gates are sunk to the ground, her
Barrs are destroyed.</p>
                  <p>Who can express the terror of
this fatal Judgment, the unexpected
eruption, the sudden increase, the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:60674:154"/>
irresistible force, the remorsless rage,
the insatiable voracity of this fiery
Judgment? the present sufferings,
the lasting miseries of private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are inexpressible; the publick
damage, the dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
(it may be) unconceivable.</p>
                  <p>What thing shall I liken to thee
O Daughter of my People? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
shall I compare the day of thy
Visitation? To the destruction of
<hi>Ierusalem?</hi> to the great and terrible
day of Judgment?</p>
                  <p>O the terrors and affrightments,
the shriekes and lamentations, the
agonies, the confusions of that Day!
They that were on the house top,
durst not stay to take any thing out
of their houses; nor he that was in
the field return back to take his
Cloaths; they that were in the
City betook themselves to the Fields
and Mountains, where they beheld
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:60674:154"/>
their flaming habitations, where
they trembled to behold the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of desolation raging in the
holy places.</p>
                  <p>How were the wise men amazed,
and the strong men terrified? despair
seised them, counsel and strength
fled away from them, there was no
help in them, they presently gave
all for lost; they stood affrighted at
a distance gazing at the dreadful
spectacle: in vain they thought it
to contend, it looked so like the
coming of the Son of Man.</p>
                  <p>The breath of the Lord kindled
the fire, <hi>he rode upon Cherub, he came
flying upon the wings of the wind.</hi> He
made <hi>the winds his Messengers,</hi> and
the <hi>flames of fire his Ministers:</hi> He
<hi>brought the Winds out of his Treasure,</hi>
and (to point the flame directly
upon the bulk and body of the
City) <hi>through his power he brought in
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:60674:155"/>
the South-East wind: as a thief in the
night,</hi> as <hi>pains upon a woman in travel,</hi>
as <hi>the lightning that cometh from the
East and passeth to the West;</hi> so came
this flaming Judgment; and so
shall the coming of the Son of Man
be. I cannot endure to dilate upon
this Argument; Sorrow and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
are in the consideration of it:
<hi>Animus meminisse horret luctu<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>

                        </expan> refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git.</hi>
Great is the Judgment, and there
is reason for us to fear that it may be
portending and symptomatical.</p>
                  <p>YEt who can tell, but God may
have mercy upon us, but he
may yet save us from destruction?
though our breach be great as the
Sea, yet is not in it self irreparable;
though our wounds be deep and
gaping, they are not desperate or
uncurable; hitherto we may say
with the Apostle, We are <hi>chastned,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:60674:155"/>
but not killed; afflicted, but not in
despair.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The signs and symptoms of an
approaching final Judgment are
not so decretory and peremptory
that we should despair. God's
signal Judgments have hitherto
been accompanied with signs of
mercies, and this is a plain case,
that he is not fond of our destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that he had rather that we
should live: <hi>He doth not afflict
willingly, nor grieve the children of
men.</hi> He stands pausing and hesita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
as he did once before, <hi>O
Ephraim, how shall I give thee up, O
Ephraim?</hi> O <hi>England,</hi> How shall I
give thee up, O <hi>England?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What mean else those Alternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and those mixtures, and combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of wonderful Judgments,
and of wonderful deliverances and
mercies which our ears have heard,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:60674:156"/>
and our eyes have seen?</p>
                  <p>We have heard with our ears, and
our Fathers have told us what wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
deliverances he wrought in their
time of old.</p>
                  <p>We have seen vicissitudes great
and prodigious, mixtures and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations,
marvellous in our eyes,
horrible destructions and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
restitutions, succeeding one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
raging Plagues at home, and
signal Victories abroad.</p>
                  <p>God hath filled us with bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and covered us with ashes:
But it <hi>is his mercy that we are not
consumed, because his compassions fail
not.</hi> If the arm of his Justice and
Severity hath been made bare, that
it might be seen of all the people,
He hath not left his mercy without
witness. If his Judgment hath been
great and terrible, in that which is
consumed, his Mercy is wonderful
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:60674:156"/>
and miraculous in that which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.
Plainly! <hi>except the Lord
had left us a Remnant,</hi> (and visibly
interposed to do it,) we should not
have had this place wherein to
humble our selves before him.
<hi>We should have been as Sodom, and
we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was he that in <hi>the midst of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
remembred mercy;</hi> when the
flaming vengeance was in its height,
when in the opinion of all men it
had arrived at the state of irresisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
and when every mans heart
failed him, when the hopes of all
men were sunk into despair; He
checked the domineering venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
he put up the flaming Sword,

                  </p>
                  <p>In a wondeful manner he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the Goods and Persons of
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:60674:157"/>
the poor Inhabitants of the City.</p>
                  <p>He restreined the rage of our
enemies, that cryed concerning our
<hi>Ierusalem, Down with it, Down
with it, Aha! so would we have it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He suffered not a foreign Enemy
to land, nor our domestick foes
to make a head in our confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>He was a wall of fire about the

and his Royal Highness,
and of those valiant Noble Persons
which adventured boldly and
strenuously, and indefatigably la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
the publique preservation.</p>
                  <p>He hath given signal Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

                  <p>He hath given us plenty of all

up an aggregation of great and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

                  <p>Arduous and difficult indeed it
is, to restore our City and defend
our Country, to restore the Houses
of God, and Publique Buildings, to
re-edifie ten Thousand private ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations;
to sustein the poor

such a temper of Justice and equity,
<hi>that there be no decay, no just com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining

in order to all those ends,

to preserve it from encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and undermining Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

and Ammon and Amalek,</hi> the <hi>French,
Dutch,</hi> and the <hi>Dane,</hi> who have
conspired to our destruction.</p>
                  <p>These things are arduous, but
not insuperable; difficult, but not
to be despaired of.</p>
                  <p>Concerning <hi>Ierusalem</hi> burned
and laid wast by the <hi>Assyrians,
Daniel</hi> foretold, that the <hi>streets and

the time came that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edified,
we read in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi>
that the labourers in one hand
held the trowel, and the other
held a weapon; one half of the
people laboured in the work, and
the other half held the Spears and
the Shields, the Bows and the
Habergeons, because of their
cruel enemies on every side.</p>
                  <p>If God shall be pleased to give
us a spirit of Understanding, and

                  <p>If our Counsels and endeavours

then (speaking humanely,

we need not greatly fear,

greater splendour than we have

                  <p>Wherefore arise, and gird your

                     <hi>Yet I cannot, I may not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to put you in remembrance
of this one thing;</hi> Except the
Lord build the City, their labour
is but lost that build it. <hi>It is not
our wisdom or industry, much
less our confidence, that will do
it, unless God be for us; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will God be for us, unless
we turn from the evil of our
ways: except we repent, we have
reason to fear, that what we
have seen hitherto, will be no
more but the beginning of our
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:60674:160"/>
sorrows. The Prophet</hi> Esay <hi>tells
us,</hi> That the Lord sent a word
unto Iacob, and it lighted on Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;
and all the people shall know
that say in the pride and stoutness
of their hearts, the Bricks are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
but we will build with hewn
Stones;
the Sycamores are down, but
we will change them into Cedars.
Therefore the Lord will set up their
adversaries, and joyn their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
together, the Syrians before,
and the Philistims behind, and they
shall devour Israel with open mouth;
Because this people turneth not to him
that smiteth them.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore turn you, turn you
every one from the evil of his ways.
Let us search our hearts, and try
our ways, and turn to <hi>him that hath
smitten us.</hi> Turn unto him with
all our hearts, with fasting and
with weeping, and mourning; he
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:60674:160"/>
hath smitten us, and he will heal us,
because his compassions fail not. Come
and let us reason together, saith God,
though your sins were as scarlet,
they shall be white as snow.</p>
                  <p>There is yet a way open to
take away the terror of our Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Judgment, and to prevent a
final Judgment from falling upon
the Nation. We are yet in the
Land of hope, and space is given
for Repentance, the door of mercy
is not yet shut upon us, nor the
ears of our Judge sealed against us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O that men would therefore praise
the Lord for his Goodness, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the wonders that he bath done
for the children of men! that hath
not dealt with us after our sins,
nor rewarded us according to our
Iniquities;</hi> that hath not cut us
off in the midst of our sins, nor
in the height of our impenitencies
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:60674:161"/>
snatched us away to Judgment;
that hath not dealt with us as

with Thousands of our Brethren,
who were better and more righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
than we.</p>
                  <p>Let us once more then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn

avoided.</p>
                  <p>Did I say deliberate? Whether
we shall save our souls from

                  <p>
                     <hi>Let us make our selves</hi> friends
of the Mammon of unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that when we fail, we may

cloath the naked; he that hath
two Coats, let him give to him
that hath none; and he that hath

meat let him do likewise.</p>
                  <p>Such an occasion scarce hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
in many hundreds of years;
and for motives to charity, they
are all comprised in that great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument

                  <p>The way is short and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious

mercy, to walk humbly before the

therefore as our heavenly Father is

him. <hi>Let us confess our wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and be sorry for our sins.</hi> Let
us lay hold on the feet of our

Blessed Redeemer, and give him
no rest till he hath sealed our
pardon. Let us bathe with our
tears the wounds that we have
made. Let us cry mightily to the
Throne of Grace. Let us wrestle
and strive with our Redeemer,
and not let <hi>him go until he bless
us:</hi> Until he open our eyes to
see the dangers we are in, and
through his mercy shew us a
way to escape them. Till he
quicken us up to resolutions of
amendment, and carry us strongly
through these resolutions. Until
he heal our backslidings, and
make up our breaches: Until he
save our souls from death, and
our Nation from destruction.</p>
                  <p>To work our selves to these

them, to make them abide upon
us all our days, let us remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

what hath been spoken, and
let us frequently meditate upon
that Sarcastical Concession of the
Text,</p>

and let thy heart chear thee in the
days of thy youth; walk in the
ways of thy heart, and the sight
of thy eyes; But know, that for all
these things God will bring thee to
Iudgment.</p>

                     <q>And the rest of the men, which were
not killed by the plagues, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
not of the works of their
hands.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>ALthough I am not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
apprehension, that
the frequencie of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential discourses,
and the seeming easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of repentance may indispose
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:60674:166"/>
some persons for such an attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as is necessary both to spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
and hearers, for a due per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Offices, which
we are about; yet I shall not
spend time in making Apologies
for the Argument, which I have
chosen.</p>
                  <p>Among all the aggravations of
our sins, there is none more hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
than the frequent hearing
of our duty: Among all the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of our lives, there is none
more fatal, than that concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the easiness of the duty of
Repentance.</p>
                  <p>To discover the fallacy, and
to prevent the dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of this imagination, I
have chosen at this time to treat
of this instructive instance of the
Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="325" facs="tcp:60674:166"/>If Repentance were so easie as
is imagined, why did not these
men repent, that are mentioned
in the words, which I have
read?</p>
                  <p>They had not only the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of Nature, and the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the Scriptures to move
them to it; they had the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
of Angels to perswade
them; they had Thunders and
Trumpets to awaken them, and
rouze them up: they had
signs and wonders in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
above, and in the earth
below: they had providenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
instances of prodigious judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and wonderful mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
                  <p>They were spectators of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Plagues brought upon their
neighbours; they were Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of singular<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> mercies and
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:60674:167"/>
deliverances a long time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to themselves.</p>
                  <p>When thousands fell beside
them, they were a remnant kept
alive; when others were destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they were preserved; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
to try whether yet they
would repent.</p>
                  <p>I say the persons in the Text
were <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>the rest</hi> of the men
that were not killed by those
Plagues: <hi>And the rest of the
men that were not killed, yet
repented not of the works of their
hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My endeavours at this time
will be, by shewing the danger
and fatal consequences of impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence,
to move my self and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to repent. And to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
precisely who these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
were, of what Nation, of
what Church, of what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:60674:167"/>
in what time they lived,
what were the Plagues brought
upon them, when and how they
were executed, and such other
particulars, I am no way obliged
by the design which I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
                  <p>About these particulars Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors
extremely differ; in
this they all agree, that they
had the advantage of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
to bring them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>Whatever is the exact, either
liberal, or mystical meaning of
this vision of the seven Angels,
and the seven Trumpets; and of
that lofty tragical Scheme, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it is represented, thus much
is evident, that notwithstanding
all Gods dealings with men to
bring them to repentance, they
will sometimes continue in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:60674:168"/>
and that this is an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
provocation.</p>
                  <p>The words which I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
contain the sad result of the
labours of six Angels, the warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of six Trumpets, the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of six Plagues, and six De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances.</p>
                  <p>And they are the common
node, or term, connecting the
Antecedent parts of the vision
(beginning at the 8<hi>th.</hi> Chapter)
with the Catastrophe thereof
(delivered in the 10<hi>th.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>They are to be considered two
ways.</p>

It first implies the strangeness of the
case, and secondly, the desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the provocation: for the
words are to be considered not only
absolutely; but also</item>
                        </list>
                     </item>
                     <item>2 Relatively; as they look backward and
forward; and are the connexion of the
Antecedent parts of the Vision with the
Catastrophe. Six Angels sounded six
Trumpets, and executed six Judgements<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>
yet they repented notâ€”<hi>They repented
not, and the seventh Angel sounded and
swore, that time</hi> (i e. Time of repentance,

The words thus resolved
would afford many considerable
observations; I shall take up
three that lye uppermost.</p>
                  <p>1. From the form and manner
of the words (as they are an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphonema</hi>
expressing a kind of
wonder, and admiration) I shall
observe the strangeness of the
impenitency, of such men as
these, considered in common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                  <p>2. From the matter of them, I
shall observe the frequencie of
such impenitencie in common
experience.</p>
                  <p>3. From the relative conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the words (as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nect
the Catastrophe of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
with the Antecedent parts
of it) I shall observe the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
consequence of this impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency:
And</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="331" facs="tcp:60674:169"/>4. Conclude with a few
words of Application.</p>
                  <p>I. First then to bring to our
apprehension the strangeness of
impenitencie of such men as these
(considered <hi>in Thesi,</hi> and in
Theory) it will be needful on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to reflect upon the causes of
admiration, and to lay before
you some of their advantages, and
Motives to Repentance.</p>
                  <p>Things wonderful in their
nature are those, whose causes
are unsearchable; things strange
and admirable to common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
are such as happen contrary
to the Laws of Nature, and of
Reason.</p>
                  <p>From the former cause the
motion of the heavens is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
from the latter it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
and admirable, that <hi>the
sun stood still in Gibeon, and the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:60674:170"/>
moon in the valley of Ajalon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That God should take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
upon the lapsed Angels,
that upon their offence he should
bind them up in chains, that he
should exclude them from the
benefit of Repentance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them to the Judgement of
the Great Day.</p>
                  <p>That he should allow this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
to lapsed men; that he
should reveal himself to them;
that he should make them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
their duty, and their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest;
that he should set before
them good and evil, happiness
and misery, the desire and the
detestation of humane nature;
that he should by all means court
and wooe them to that which all
men naturally desire; and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage,
and divert them from
that which they naturally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr:
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:60674:170"/>
That after all this he should
not prevail in such a case as
this; that they should scornful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reject the end of all their
hopes; that they should studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
pursue the object of all
their fears; This is that rational
wonder that I am now to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you.</p>
                  <p>To manifest this wonder a
little more explicitely, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the advantages of Nature,
and the Motives from Scripture
to bring men to repentance.</p>
                  <p>The grounds and fundamental
elements of the Doctrine of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
are these: The Being &amp;
Attributes of God; The immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
of the Souls of men; The
principles of <hi>Synteresis;</hi> The
terrours of natural Conscience;
The for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ngeance;
The apprehension and desire of
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:60674:171"/>
an Attonement: And all these
are manifest from the Dictates
and discoveries of the Light of
Nature.</p>
                  <p>The heavens declare the glory
of God, and the firmament shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his handy work: <hi>They speak
it loud, they spread it largely,

of glorious instances to

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:60674:176"/>
rejected, however heinous, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
numerous were their sins.
The prodigal <hi>devoured his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
with harlots:</hi> Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen
<hi>had seven Devils: Peter</hi>
denyed his Master <hi>with</hi> horrid

<hi>and his soul was</hi> straight-way
<hi>grieved,</hi> and he delivered them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Instead of many, consider that
one instance of</hi> Manasses, <hi>the evil
son of good King</hi> Hezekiah:<note place="margin">2 Chron. 33.</note> He
set up altars for Baalim, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipp'd
all the host of heaven:
Altars in the court of the temple;
an idol in the very temple; he
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:60674:177"/>
caused his sons to pass through the
fire; he observed times, used in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments,
dealt with familiar

Iudah, and Ierusalem to do worse
than the heathen. And the Lord
spake to him, and he would not
hear. <hi>After all this,</hi> in his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
he humbled himself, and

                  </p>
                  <p>His thoughts are not as our

                  <p>On the other side, we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of horrible judgements
for Impenitency; whereof I shall

                  <p>Now considering all these
things, is it no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> repent? That no
consideration of ingenuity, or of
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:60674:178"/>
interest should move them to it?
That neither the Law written in
their hearts, nor that which was
delivered by the mediation of
Angels, nor the Gospel given us
by the Son of God should bring
them to it? That neither reason,
nor experience; neither mercies
nor judgements; neither the

nor the torments of a bad; the
beauties of vertue, nor the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of sin; the shortness of
life, nor length of eternity; the
lightness of things present, nor
the <hi>exceeding weight</hi> of those
which are to come? That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Death nor Life, nor Angels,
nor Trumpets; <hi>nor things present,

                     <pb n="349" facs="tcp:60674:178"/>
Is it not strange? The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
the Prophets were astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at this; nay, God himself seems
to be affected with wonder:
<hi>Hear, O heavens, and give ear,<note place="margin">Isa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>This is that wonder consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in it self according to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
reason, the object of our
first observation, drawn from
the form and manner of the words
by way of <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> expressed
by the particle <hi>yet; yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>II. The second Observation
was taken from the matter of the
words: However such impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
is very strange to common
reason (considered in the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
yet it is too frequent in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
and in common experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:

                  </p>
                  <p>This is that grand contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that fatal paradox of the
life of man: His very being
consists in rationality; his acting
is contrary to all the reason in the

                  <p>THese words are part of
a Song made by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;</hi>
and both the song
it self, and these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
words are so very consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
that I should think it a
disrespect put upon the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of a venerable intelligent
auditory, to be very laborious in
gathering arguments to perswade
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:60674:205"/>
your attention to them: the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the antiquity, the penman,
do all render it considerable.</p>
                  <p>For as for the subject matter of
the song, it contain in it (as the
Hebrew writers have observed)
a summary of the law, or penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch
of <hi>Moses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Consider it as a piece of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
there is hardly any poem
so venerable: it was written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

<hi>Linus, David's</hi> or <hi>Asaph's</hi> poems;
and except a piece of the same
hand, it is the most antient song,
that is extant in the world.</p>
                  <p>It was penn'd by one of the
most considerable persons: look
upon him humanely, and he was
very remarkable, for his abstruse
learning;<note place="margin">Acts 7. 22.</note> (<hi>He was learned in all
the learning of the Egyptians</hi>)
for his military conduct; for his
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:60674:205"/>
policy in administration of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
for his felicity in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a law so suitable to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
of the people; that after so
many thousand years it alone of
all antient laws continues in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
to this day.</p>
                  <p>But if we look upon him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to God, there was none
like unto him; he conversed with
God face to face; he was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his secrets, he was entrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the administration of his
powers in signs and wonders, in
the sight of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and of <hi>Israel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was inspired and dictated

by God himself;<note place="margin">32. 19. v. 22.</note>

before his transport and rage had

<pb n="407" facs="tcp:60674:206"/>
and hearken O earth to the words
of my mouth, my doctrine shall drop
as the rain,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The song indeed it self is large
and very satyrical; but the great
argument or burthen of it is in
the words of my text: <hi>Do ye
thus requite the Lord, O foolish
people and unwise?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words are (as I said) the
burthen or argument of the song
applicable to every part of it,
repetible at the end of every
stanza, and indeed of every pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod.</p>
                  <p>God is a rock, his work is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
his ways are judgment: They
have corrupted themselves, they
are spotted, perverse, and crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
Do ye thus requite the
Lord?</p>
                  <p>But more particularly, God
hath been good to <hi>Israel,</hi> he
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:60674:207"/>
raised him from nothing, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
him from bondage, he
was his Protector, his Guide, his
Proveditore, his food was of the
most delicious, his drink was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous,
of the <hi>pure blood of the
grape,</hi> and <hi>he grew fat</hi> upon itâ€”
<hi>But</hi> Jeshurun <hi>waxed fat and kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi>
Do ye thus requite, <hi>O popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
ingrate</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>)?</p>
                  <p>Again; well; but will God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
this base ingratitude? doth
he not see it, or not resent it?
doth it not move him? can
he not, will he not revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon them? Yes, <hi>the Lord
saw it, and was moved to Iealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie;
a fire was kindled in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
Do ye thus requite the Lord,
O foolish people and unwise?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the Interest, which
these words have in the song;
and they consist of two general
parts:</p>
                  <list>
                     <pb n="409" facs="tcp:60674:207"/>
                     <item>1. An expostulation; <hi>Do ye
thus requite the Lord?</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. A censure; <hi>O foolish peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and unwise.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The former of these needs no
explication, being an ardent and
vehement exprobration of the
ingratitude of this people; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
every word is weighty, and
very Emphatical. The manner
of the retribution, the parties Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiting
and Requited. Ye men:
Ye men of <hi>Israel!</hi> do ye make
such a requital? such a requital
to the Lord?</p>
                  <p>To requite evil for good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Equals is against the light
of the sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> and much
more against the light of <hi>Israel,</hi>
But for <hi>Israel</hi> after their instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and their experiences to
do despight to the great and the
gracious, and the terrible, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:60674:208"/>
and avenging God, it
implies so much ingratitude,
and so high a degree of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
and madness as is not
to be measured. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he doth not attempt to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neate
or describe it, but like one
astonished at it, he expostulates
with them in a vast abrupt Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation;
<hi>Do ye thus requite the
Lord?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now the latter general
part, which contains the censure
of them, may perhaps require a
little explication: Foolish and
Unwise may possibly seem to
some to have a little flatness in it,
and tautology.</p>
                  <p>Here therefore we must be take
our selves to the Original; and
there we shall find a considerable
difference, betwixt the notions
of those two words, which are
thus translated.</p>

<hi>they forgot God their

great things for them; they soon

                     <hi>and dissemble with their

                     <note place="margin">Ps. 106. 24.</note>
yea, <hi>they offered their sons and

                     <hi>How often did they provoke
God in the wilderness, and grieve
him in the desart? Many a time did
he deliver them, but they provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
him with their Counsels.</hi> He
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:60674:215"/>
divided the Sea for their passage,
and clove the rocks for their
sustenance, and covered them
with a Cloud for their protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and they sinned yet the more.
<hi>They tempted him, they spoke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, they provoked him at
the sea, even at the red Sea: they
turned back and tempted God, and
limited the holy one of Israel.</hi> In
one word; they were a rebellious
house,<note place="margin">Ezek. 44.</note> a stiff-necked people;<note place="margin">Ps. 78.</note> they
kept not the Covenant which
themselves had made; they would
none of his precepts, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
his promises, and his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,<note place="margin">Is. 48. 4.</note>
                     <hi>their neck had an Iron sinew
and they had a brow of brass.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was their behaviour, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
then when Gods miracles
were fresh, and <hi>Moses</hi> was still
among them. And God foresaw
that after his decease they would
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:60674:216"/>
provoke him yet more. This
was that requital, which stirred
and inflamed the spirit of <hi>Moses;</hi>
and quickned him to that abrupt
Expostulation, the first general
part of the text, whereof I have
hitherto been giving an account,
<hi>Do ye thus requite the Lord?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You have seen some part of
<hi>Israels</hi> ingratitude; it follows that
we consider the <hi>Turpitude</hi> and
the <hi>Imprudence</hi> of this ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
which gave occasion for
the censure here passed upon
them, (O <hi>foolish</hi> people and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</hi>)
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> And first of the <hi>Turpitude</hi>

will appear that they were <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
Now to set forth the unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their ingratitude against
God in all the aggravations of it,
it is a task too heavy for me (nay,
even for Angels;) and <hi>Moses</hi>
                     <pb n="427" facs="tcp:60674:216"/>
when he was inspired, and in the
height of his rapture, did not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
it; but making a chasme,
and drawing a veil over that part,
insinuates it to be unexpressible.
I shall not therefore offer at im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities,
but follow the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
which the Scriptures have
provided for us in like cases. It
is the manner of the Scriptures
in things concerning God, which
are incomprehensible, to bait the
mind, and train it on by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising

                     </gap> incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
to give us therefore a little
notion of it, the Prophet brings
men to the consideration of the
love of a mother to her child; <hi>can
a Mother forget her Child</hi> &amp;c?
The love <hi>of Man</hi> to God holds no
proportion to his Excellency, and
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:60674:217"/>
his goodness; and the heart in
judging of it is obnoxious to
mistakes, and very deceitful;
therefore the Apostle helps us
towards an apprehension of it.
<hi>He that loves not his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 20.</note>
whom he hath seen; how
can he love God, whom he hath
not seen?</hi> So seeing the turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of mens ingratitude to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God is ineffable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable,
it will be requisite
to speak a little of the unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Ingratitude towards men,
and leave you to work out this
proportion; <hi>Look how high the
heaven is in comparison of the
earth,</hi> so great, nay infinitely grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is the unworthiness of ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
towards God.</p>
                  <p>And here I shall not go about
to Philosophize, or to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the turpitude of ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,

from the nature of it, <hi>Ã  pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ori.</hi>
The immediate and evident
corollaries of natural principles,
admit only of jejune and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
reasonings in that kind
of demonstration. The odious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of ingratitude is such a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary,
naturally and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
flowing from that universal
maxim,<note place="margin">Matt. 7. 12<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

&amp;c. which runs thorow all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality;
and is not only the last
resolution of Philosophy, but of
the Law and the Prophets, and
of the Gospel. <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 31. As
therefore, when an abstruse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
in matter of speculation
is resolved into an evident prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
or the contrary position
into a plain absurdity, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrator
goes no further, but
hath said all that can be perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
spoken: so when a piece
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:60674:218"/>
of doubtful Morality is once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
into this grand absurdity,
<hi>Omnia dixeris,</hi> there is no more
to be added, all the rest is dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution.</p>
                  <p>It is said that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> made
no law against ingratitude, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Nature had made one to his
hand.<note place="margin">Prov. 17. 13.</note> So some Divines have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
that there is no direct
precept against ingratitude in
the Scripture, though many te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
in effect against it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was needless, as being
supposed from the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and below the Majestie of
the spirit breathing in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to insist upon it (according
to that of our Saviour,<note place="margin">Matt. 5. 48.</note> 
                     <hi>If ye love
and do good,<note place="margin">Luc. 6. 32, 34.</note> and lend to them
that love and do good to you, what
thanks, or reward have you? do
not Sinners or Publicans even the

same?</hi>) To that spirit which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
us to return good for evil,
to love our Enemies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it were
a kind of whiffling to command
the return of good for good,
or prohibit the return of evil
to those that have obliged us.
Now of these two sorts of ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
the <hi>former</hi> is branded in
Scripture with an everlasting
brand,<note place="margin">Gen. 40. 23.</note> in the case of <hi>Pharaoh's</hi>

the ingratitude in the text being
of the <hi>latter</hi> kind, and of a deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
die, and because the easiest
Criterion of turpitude is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
of all the sons of men, I
shall endeavour <hi>Ã  posteriori</hi> by
some Scriptural instances of the
resentments of that kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,
to shew the turpitude
of it in the judgment of mankind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="432" facs="tcp:60674:219"/>We read when <hi>Ioash</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<hi>Zachariah</hi> to be stoned
(who was the son of <hi>Iehojada,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Chron. 24.</note>
who had preserved him in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority
from <hi>Athaliah,</hi> and made

against him, and kill'd him
in his bed, because he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
not the kindness of <hi>Iehoja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
but slew his son. When
<hi>Abner</hi> apprehended ingratitude
in <hi>Ishbosheth,</hi>

                  <p>It may be objected that the
resentment of these men was not
so considerable, as that the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:60674:219"/>
of Mankind should be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
from it; those that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired

the son of an <hi>Ammonitess,</hi> and
<hi>Iehozabad</hi> the son of a <hi>Moabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess;</hi>
and we read not any great
praise, either of the piety or
morality of <hi>Abner.</hi> Consider then
the resentments of <hi>Gideon;</hi> of
whom it is said, <hi>the Lord was
with Gideon,</hi> and of <hi>David,
the man after God's own heart.</hi>
When the men of <hi>Succoth</hi> dealt

                  <p>From what hath been spoken of

<pb n="437" facs="tcp:60674:221"/>
of <hi>Israels</hi> ingratitude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

perfectly, yet it may in some

                  <p>It remains that we consider
the imprudence of it: <hi>O foolish

                  </p>
                  <p>III. I may not, I need not insist
long upon this Argument.
There are (as I conceive) but
these five suppositions, which
possibly might exempt them from
the censure of the text. 1. If
their God were like the gods of
the heathen, and did not know
their behaviour toward him. Or
2. If he were the God of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus,</hi>
and did not resent it. Or
3. If they could escape from
him. Or 4. If they could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
themselves to him. Or 5.
If they were able to support
themselves against him. If none
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:60674:222"/>
of these were in the case, they
will stand convicted of horrible
imprudence; it will then be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that they were a foolish
people, and unwise. Of these
things briefly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1. Did not God know their
behaviour? The Psalmist indeed
tells of a brutish people, which
wrought all manner of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and yet they said,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ps. 94. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</note> The Lord
shall not see it, neither shall the
God of <hi>Jacob</hi> regard it: <hi>But,</hi> O
ye fools, <hi>saith he,</hi> when will ye
be wise? He that planted the ear,
shall he not hear? He that formed
the eye, shall not he see? He that
teacheth man knowledge, shall not
he know? The Lord knoweth the
thoughts of men.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>beholding the evil &amp;

                  <p>2. <hi>But it may be, though he
knew their behaviour, yet he
did not concern himself about
them; it may be he did not
much resent their dealings with
him;</hi> Neither if they be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
is he the better; neither if

                     <note place="margin">Ps. 106. 40, 23.</note> He heard

he have destroyed them, had not
Moses stood in the gap to turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
his anger.</p>
                  <p>3. But possibly for all this
there might be some way to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape
from him, and to conveigh
themselves out of the sphere of
his activity.</p>
                  <p>There have been those, who

to be a topical God;<note place="margin">1 Kings 20. 23, 28, 29.</note> 
                     <hi>a God
of the mountains only,</hi> and that
the valleys were out of his
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:60674:224"/>
power and jurisdiction: true;
but because the <hi>Syrians</hi> said that
he was not God of the valleys,
he delivered them into the hands
of <hi>Israel,</hi> who slew a hundred
thousand foot-men in one

                  <p>
                     <hi>Nay but,</hi> Behold the Heaven

Shall they escape for their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
Whither can they go then
from his Spirit?<note place="margin">Ps. 139. 7.</note> or whither can
they flee from his presence? If
they could ascend into Heaven, he
is there; if they could make their
bed in hell, behold he is there?</p>
                  <p>4. But though they cannot
escape out of his reach, possibly
they may plead something in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
of their doings, which may
mitigate his indignation; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they were ignorant, that
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:60674:224"/>
God was concerned, ignorant
of his will, and of his ways, they
had no instruction, they had no

                  <p>Briefly and plainly to lay the

<pb n="448" facs="tcp:60674:227"/>
had heard with their ears of the
drowning of the old world;
Their fathers had told them of
the fire and brimstone, which
devoured the Cities of <hi>Sodom</hi>
and <hi>Gomorrha;</hi> They had been
witnesses of the plagues brought
upon <hi>Egypt;</hi> They beheld the
fire that consumed <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bihu;</hi>
They stood by, when <hi>the

Dathan, and covered the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation

thousands at their right hand for
their ingratitude, and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and yet they behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so as hath been represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Judge in your selves, was
it wisdome thus to requite the
Lord? Were they, or were they

                  <p>
                     <pb n="449" facs="tcp:60674:227"/>We have now seen the case of

he the Creator and preserver of
every individual person? is not
he the disposer of nations? the
ordainer and orderer of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments?
the framer of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in the world? In every one
of these respects it is evidently
true, which is delivered by the
Psalmist,<note>Ps. 100. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>It is he that hath made
us, and not we our selves, we
are his people, and the sheep of
his pasture.</hi> As for our personal
being, and better being, was it
not from him that we received
our bodies, our Souls, our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
<hi>(all things pertaining
unto life and Godliness?) His
eyes did see our substance yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
imperfect,<note>Ps. 139. 16.</note> and in his book
were all our members written. He
poured us out like Milk, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
us like Cheese, cloathed us
with skin and flesh, fenced us with
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:60674:229"/>
bones and sinews:</hi> he breathed
into us life and spirit, saying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, Live: he stamped his Image
upon us, and made us live the
life of men; he commanded,
and we were born of Christian
Parents, and baptized, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated
into the life of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
<hi>Hath</hi> he not made us?
Nay, <hi>doth</hi> he not make us, and
that every moment, by sustein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and <hi>upholding</hi> our being <hi>by
the word of his power;</hi> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining
our spirits, and preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our souls and life by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
visitation, by his protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and by this provision? <hi>There
is no man that hath power over
the spirit,</hi>
                     <note>Job 10. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>to retein the spirit.</hi>
All the wit and industry and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of all men upon earth,
nay of all creatures in Heaven
and earth, cannot make one
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:60674:229"/>
grain of any one of that infinite
variety of things, which are of
necessity or of convenience to the
being or preservation of men.
And this is so evident upon the
shallowest consideration, that S.
<hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Lystra,</hi> when the Priest
of <hi>Iupiter</hi> (supposing him to
be <hi>Mercurius</hi>) would have sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
to him, appealed to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
as Gods witness against
the depth of heathenish darkness.
<hi>He left not himself without
witness in that he gave rain from
Heaven,<note>Act. 14. 17.</note> filling our hearts with
food and gladness.</hi> So that in
this respect our case is parallel.
Hath not God dealt with us as
with <hi>Israel?</hi> Hath he not made
us as to our personal and private
condition?</p>
                  <p>Again, if we consider our selves
in our national publick capacity
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:60674:230"/>
in reference to the political frame
of our Government, Civil and
Ecclesiastical, hath he not made
us?</p>
                  <p>It was in reference to this that
<hi>Moses</hi> asked this question; and
to help their understandings in
the consideration of it for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
in the words immediately
following he calls upon them to
search into their antiquities, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon their original, and their
progress. <hi>Remember,</hi> saith he, <hi>the
days of old, and consider the years
of many generations. Ask thy
Fathers and they will tell thee,
thy Elders and they will shew
thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now I say unto you, <hi>Have
you not heard long ago how he
hath done it, and of ancient days
how he hath formed it?</hi> How he
hath formed the state of this
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:60674:230"/>
Island, and reformed it; how
he never gave over working,
hewing, and fabricating the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
thereof, till <hi>he had fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
them into a glorious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Kingdom,</hi> from <hi>a most bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barons,
savage, scattered, heathen
people.</hi> How oft did the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Potter bring the stubborn
matter to the wheel; <hi>overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
overturning, overturning?</hi>
To civilize the Britains he
brought in the Romans, then
tried the Britains again. When
that would not frame to his
hand, he brought in the Saxons,
and upon them the Danes; then
tried the Saxons again; and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he brought in the Normans;
nations o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> various tempers, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms,
religions, languages;
caused nation to rise against na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
&amp;c. he committed them
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:60674:231"/>
one with another, and among
themselves; he mixed and blended
them by many a terrible combat
and collision; he polish'd the
roughness of them; by the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of the Gospel he fermented
and matured and sweetned them,
till by his powerful word light
was brought out of darkness; out
of a multitude of disorders and
confusions sprang forth a noble
well-tempered form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
&amp; System of Laws Civil &amp;
Ecclesiastical, equal at least to
those of any other people; har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniously
conspiring (if duly
executed) to conserve all estates,
orders, and degrees in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
happiness whereof any socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is capable; conducting us by
the hand of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi>
and their subordinate Ministers,
to the great ends of the great or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:60674:231"/>
of God in the world,
and apt to enable and to dispose
well-minded men (by the means
of grace, and motives to sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
righteousness, and godliness,
which we enjoy) by peace and
plenty, by liberty and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
(in all which we exceed all
others) to produce effects of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
courage and magnanimity,
such as we read of in the stories
of our Ancestors; and of Piety,
and Devotion in proportion an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to those of our glorious
Predecessors (that is not inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
in their kind to any nation in
the world.) Surely <hi>this</hi> also <hi>hath
been of the Lords doing,</hi> in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to Society Civil and Sacred:
it is he that hath made us, and
not we our selves. Now let us
pass to the second enquiry.</p>
                  <p>2. Hath he not <hi>redeemed</hi> us? and
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:60674:232"/>
that also in both capacities, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
and national.</p>
                  <p>1. For our persons spiritually
and temporally; hath he not
bought our souls at a price; hath
he not offered us a plenteous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
by the blood of the
everlasting Covenant, redeemed
us from the curse of the Law,
the bondage of Sin, the power
of Satan, the wrath of God?
Again, is there any one single
person to whom he hath not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
many a temporal deliverance
(known and unknown, or
at least-wise unconsidered?)
Hath not he redeemed us from
the prison of the womb, from
the hazards of our infancy, from
the perils of our childhood, from
the wildness and precipitancy
of youth, from the snares and
entanglements of our riper years?
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:60674:232"/>
Is there any one whom he hath
not redeemed <hi>from six troubles
and from seven,</hi> in our bodies,
estates, liberty, reputation?
whom he hath not powerfully
and frequently rescued from the
folly and perverseness of our
selves, from the malice of our
neighbours, from the rage of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils?
Hath he not redeemed us
in our personal capacities?</p>
                  <p>2. Hath he not redeemed our
<hi>nation</hi> again and again, in all its
interest civil and sacred? Who
else was it that delivered our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and our selves from Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risme
and Idolatry, from Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
and Superstition, from
fanatical Anarchy, and Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>To omit former deliverances,
can we forget how it is but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
while since the wrath of God
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:60674:233"/>
was poured out upon this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to the uttermost? since
our Sun was turned into dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and our Moon into blood,
our stars ravisht from their Orbs,
the Royal father Martyred, the
Son banished, the Nobles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,
the State dissolved,
the Church destroyed, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
Laws, Liberty, Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
torn away; our bones were
dryed, our hope was gone, and
we thought we had been clean
cut off. Then <hi>when we cried unto
the Lord in our trouble, he delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
us out of our distress: He sent
redemption to his people, he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our captivity as the Rivers of
the South; then was our mouth fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with laughter, and our tongue
with Ioy.</hi> The Symptoms
of joy and triumph were heard, and
seen in all the corners of the
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:60674:233"/>
land; nay <hi>the Sea roared, and the
floods clapped their hands,</hi> the
hills and the heavens resounded
because of the redemption; for
<hi>he cometh, for he cometh</hi> -&amp;c.
And now I say unto you, hath
he not redeemed us?</p>
                  <p>3. Hath he not established
us? that is to say, the Estalish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which we enjoy, is it not
all from him? and hath not he
done his part for our establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
our spiritual and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
our private, our publick e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishment?</p>
                  <p>Doth not the God of all
grace continually press upon us
the means of grace, calling us
to his Eternal glory; endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to make us perfect, to
establish, strengthen, and settle
us in his truth, to establish us in
the faith, and in holiness, to
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:60674:234"/>
strengthen our inward man, that
we may be rooted and grounded
and built up in him, to a lively
hope, and an humble assurance
of eternal life.</p>
                  <p>All spiritual Establishment, is
it not from God? is there any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
within the verge of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties

                  <p>Again, for our temporal pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
condition, is there any one
of us destitute of some sort of

or friends; by charitable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence,
by the bounty of
contingency or the like? Are not
every one of these from the
Lord? is any one destitute of
one or more of these ways of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishment,
or that can answer,
that God hath made no provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for them? hath he not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us our temporal establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
                  <p>Lastly, hath not God done
his part towards a National and
a publick establishment of this
Church and Kingdom?</p>
                  <p>Hath he not in order thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
resetled our gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
in the throne of his Royal
Predecessors? Re-established the
Church upon its rightful Basis
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:60674:235"/>
and foundation? Restored all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and degrees to their legal
rights, proprieties, privileges and
liberties? Reinforced our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and our Laws in the due ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of Discipline and
Justice? Reduced all things into
that ancient frame and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which had from many Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
derived happiness and
glory to the people of <hi>England?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, for preservation and
continuance of all these, hath he
not restored the actual strength
of the Kingdom, our Forts and
Castles, our stores and magazines,
our Towns and Cities, our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
and Navies, lately rescued
out of the hands of rebellious U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpers
to those Royal hands, to
which they do of right belong? In
one word therefore to conclude
this first enquiry, hath not God
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:60674:235"/>
dealt with us as he did with <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;</hi>
hath he not <hi>made</hi> us, <hi>redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi>
us, <hi>established</hi> us?</p>
                  <p>The next consideration ought
to be, whether we have not so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited
the Lord as they requited
him. Whether our behaviour
hath not been answerable to that
of <hi>Israel,</hi> in reference both to the
foolish part, and the unwise. And
here alas! how clear and conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
is the parallel in respect of

                  </p>
                  <p>Have we not dealt, do we not
deal ungratefully with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
and instruments of all our
mercies? Have all Gods me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
and various dealings with
us prevailed so far as to bring out
persons to repentance, or our
Kingdom to a Reformation?
Have we been convinced, or have
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:60674:236"/>
we not been hardened by his
wonders, converted to his fears
or sealed up into a sottish stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
and senseless contempt of
Religion, a spirit of Atheism,
and downright infidelity?</p>
                  <p>Do we not murmur against
<hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron?</hi> do not some
amongst us still abet the cause of
<hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram?</hi> are
not some of us ready to make
them a Captain, and to return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Egypt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Have we not soon</hi> forgot God
our saviour? <hi>have we not</hi> flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
him with our lips, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
with him in our double
heart?</p>
                  <p>Do we not despise our very
Manna; and wish again for the
Garlick of <hi>Egypt?</hi> ready to
change our glory for the Calves
of <hi>Egypt</hi> or the confusion of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon?</hi>
                     <pb n="467" facs="tcp:60674:236"/>
In a word, are we not <hi>a
sinful people laden with iniquity,</hi>
as ingrateful and Nabalistical as
<hi>Israel,</hi> a foolish people?</p>
                  <p>Again, for matter of impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
wherewithal can we
purge our selves from it?</p>
                  <p>Doth not God know our miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
also? doth he not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
us &amp; ourways? and doth he
not interest himself in us? doth
he not resent our provocations?
can we escape for our wickedness?
With what apologies shall we
<hi>come before the Lord, and bow
our selves before the high God?</hi>
Have we had no caveats from the
Ministers of God, no warnings,
no Alarms from God himself?
have we not heard, have we not
seen, hath it not been told us?
The thunders, and the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
the trumpets sounding,
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:60674:237"/>
the mountain smoaking, the
Angel destroying, the Sword de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring.
Are we able to contest
with a jealous God? are we
stronger than he? are we able
to tear him out of his Throne, or
to devest him of his Thunder,
or to stand the storm of his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery
indignation? Have we not
been a foolish people &amp; unwise!</p>
                  <p>What then remains, but that
God should execute upon us the
sentence which we our selves
have been ready to pass upon the
people in the text, that he
should do thus, and thus, unto
us; that <hi>he should consume us in
a moment, and blot out our names
from under Heaven?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, rather it remains (men
and brethren) lest he should do
thus, and thus, unto us, that we
prepare to meet the Lord our
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:60674:237"/>
God; that we rouze up the spirit
of our minds, and discuss and
scatter that Lethargic stupor that
is upon us: <hi>Awake, awake, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah;
and arise, Barak, the son of
Ahinoam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who can tell but God may
yet have mercy upon us, may
have mercy upon our souls, and
speak peace to our land!</p>
                  <p>When I say to the wicked,<note>Ezek. 33. 14, 15.</note> thou
shalt surely dye; if he turn from
his wickedness, and do that which
is lawful and right, he shall surely
live, he shall not die: he hath done
that which is lawful and right,
he shall surely live.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore let every one of us
examine himself and find out the
plague of his own heart, and be
deeply sensible of his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude;
let us search and try
our ways, and turn again unto
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:60674:238"/>
the Lord; let us make haste to
escape, before the decree bring
forth, and we be surprised by
