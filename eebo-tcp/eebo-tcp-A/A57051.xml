         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE
REPUTATION
OF
Dr. OATES
(The Firſt DISCOVERER of the
horrid POPISH PLOT)
CLEAR'D.</head>
            <p>DOctor <hi>TITUS OATES,</hi> having on the
19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>November,</hi> 1679. preferred a
Bill of Indictment againſt <hi>Thomas Knox,</hi>
who was formerly Servant to the Earl of
<hi>Danby,</hi> and his Son the Lord <hi>Dunblain,</hi> and
<hi>John Lane</hi> and <hi>William Osborn,</hi> (both) once his Servants.
The grand Jury found the Bill againſt the three. But,
<hi>Osborn</hi> being fled, the Court appointed the other two to
be tryed on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> inſtant; upon which day
the Jury not filling in time, and ſome other buſineſs
intervening, the Court adjourn'd the ſaid Tryal until
<hi>Tueſday,</hi> the Twenty fifth of <hi>November.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At which time the Court being ſate, there appeared
therein a great number of Perſons of Honour, and
Gentlemen of good Quality, to ſee and hear a Tryal of
ſuch a nature, and a Scrutiny that ſo much concerned the
Honour and Reputation of the Proteſtant Religion, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104693:3"/>
upon which ſo much depended the diſplay of Popiſh
Machination.</p>
            <p>The Priſoners being brought to the Bar, the Jury
ſworn, whereof Sir <hi>John Kirk</hi> was Fore-man, and the
Priſoners arraign'd, their Indictment was read, to which
they ſeverally pleaded, not guilty.</p>
            <p>In the Indictment is included in a manner the Sum of
their whole Crimes, <hi>That</hi> whereas it had been proved,
that there was a moſt horrid Plot carried on by <hi>Roman
Catholics,</hi> in and out of the Kingdom, againſt the Life
and Government of His moſt Sacred Majeſty, and that
divers had been deſervedly executed for the ſame, and
others lay ſtill under Impeachment in the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi>
and elſewhere, for the ſame Crimes, as the Lords, <hi>Powis,
Petre, Arundel, Bellaſis, Caſtlemain, &amp;c.</hi> as the ſaid <hi>Knox,
Lane,</hi> and <hi>Osborn</hi> well knew. Notwithſtanding which,
they the ſaid <hi>Knox, Lane,</hi> and <hi>Osborn,</hi> did maliciouſly and
falſely endeavour to ſtifle the farther Diſcovery of the
Plot as much as in them lay. And in favour to the ſaid
Impeached Lords and others, and for the preventing of
Juſtice, and that the ſaid Perſons might eſcape the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Law, did ſlander and defame Dr. <hi>Titus Oates</hi>
Clerk, and <hi>William Bedlow</hi> Gentleman, two of the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers
of the ſaid Plot; and that in order thereunto, <hi>Knox</hi>
did heretofore endeavour to bribe one Mr. <hi>Wiggens,</hi> then
Servant to Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> to give him Copies of all his
Maſter's Papers of Secrecy, that he ſhould take notice
of all ſuch Lords as came at any time to diſcourſe his
Maſter; and give him their Names in writing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> the ſaid <hi>Knox</hi> had obliged himſelf to introduce
the ſaid <hi>Wiggens</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> into Company with the Earl of
<hi>Danby;</hi> at any hour in the night Seaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> the Counteſs of <hi>Danby,</hi> who well approved of
what <hi>Lane</hi> had engaged to endeavour, did likewiſe offer
to introduce <hi>Wiggens,</hi> and his Mother to her Lord in her
own Coach at any time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Knox</hi> had divers Conferences with <hi>Lane</hi> and <hi>Osborn</hi>
in the Cloyſter-walks of the <hi>Abby</hi> Church at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:104693:3"/>
That upon diſcovery of this Deſign in <hi>February</hi> laſt,
Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> expell'd from his Service the ſaid <hi>Lane</hi> and
<hi>Osborn;</hi> but that then this <hi>Knox</hi> did hire them Lodgings in
obſcure places, and ſometimes lay with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Knox</hi> had forged ſeveral Letters, as from <hi>Lane</hi>
and <hi>Osborn,</hi> directed to himſelf, therein expreſſing how
perplexed in Conſcience they were at the malicious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
of their Maſter Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> againſt
the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> and other Lords in the <hi>Tower.</hi> All
which Contrivances they were reſolved to diſcover, and
alſo make it appear, that their ſaid Maſter was a moſt
vicious and infamous Man, and had made many attempts
of Buggery upon the Body of <hi>Lane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In purſuance of which deviliſh Deſign, they did repair
to a Juſtice of Peace, to give in upon Oath their Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
of theſe forged Crimes againſt the Doctor, which
the ſaid Juſtice refuſing to take, they drew up one them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and delivered it unto the Lord <hi>Latimer,</hi> who kept
it a few days, then delivered it back, to be conveyed to
the Lord <hi>Powis</hi> to amend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> the Lord <hi>Powis</hi> did ſend it to one Mr. <hi>Henry Nevil,</hi>
alias <hi>Paine,</hi> a Priſoner in the Priſon of the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi>
to enlarge and give colourable Proofs thereunto</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> the ſaid Papers ſo enlarged and amended, were
conveyed unto the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> to do the like. From
whence they came to the hands of Mr. <hi>Thomas Willoughby,</hi>
aliàs <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> who out of them drew Affidavits, which
the ſaid <hi>Lane</hi> offered to ſwear to before he had read them;
adding, that he would ſwear any thing againſt his Maſter,
ſo that he might be a gainer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> afterwards they did ſwear theſe forged and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Informations before the Worſhipful Sir <hi>James Butler,</hi>
one of His Majeſty's Juſtices of the Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> the ſaid <hi>Knox</hi> did at ſeveral times purpoſely drop
or let fall ſeveral pieces of Gold called <hi>Guinneys,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Silver, which they took up as their own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Knox</hi> did promiſe them, as from the Earl of
<hi>Danby,</hi> beneficial Places, either in the Treaſury or Cuſtoms,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104693:4"/>
and promiſed them, as from the other Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi>
Five hundred Pounds in hand, and each One hundred
Pound <hi>per Annum</hi> to be ſetled upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> after the Deſign had gone thus far, they being in
<hi>February</hi> laſt apprehended and committed to the <hi>Gate-houſe,</hi>
were examined upon their Oaths by Sir <hi>William Waller;</hi> and
Collonel <hi>Warcup;</hi> to whom they confeſſed, that all they
had ſworn againſt Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was malicious and falſe, and
that they were prompted, hired, and encouraged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
by the ſaid <hi>Knox,</hi> and that they did verily believe,
that the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> in confidence of the ſucceſs of
this Deſign, did ſurrender himſelf to the black Rod.</p>
            <p>Soon after this, they were brought before a Committee
of Lords then ſitting in the Lord Privy-Seal's Chamber,
where alſo appeared the two Juſtices, who ſhewed their
Lordſhips the ſaid Examinations, which they owned, and
humbly prayed the mercy and forgiveneſs of their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
and their Maſter Dr. <hi>Oates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A few days after which they were diſcharged from the
<hi>Gate-houſe;</hi> but no ſooner had they their liberty, but upon
the Inſtigation a ſecond time, of the ſaid <hi>Knox,</hi> in behalf
of the Lords, and other Popiſh perſons, but they moſt
impudently and maliciouſly reſumed the proſecution of
their aforeſaid falſe and forged Informations againſt the
ſaid Dr. <hi>Oates;</hi> and have alſo been received and lodged in
the Houſe of the Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> and at his charge, and with
and from the ſaid Lord, and other Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi>
had frequent Conferences and Directions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> when they lodged at Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi>'s Houſe, they had
an allowance of Ten Shillings <hi>per</hi> Week.</p>
            <p>And this preſent Term did bring the ſaid falſe, forged,
and ſlanderous Papers and Matters into the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi>
thence and thereupon to frame an Indictment
againſt the ſaid Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> which was by the Jury found
<hi>Ignoramus,</hi> and thrown out.</p>
            <p>After all which they now ſtand here to make Defence
to theſe their villainous Crimes of Forgery and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
and ſlandering the King's Evidence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:104693:4"/>
The Doctor had many Witneſſes (13) to prove the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
againſt them.</p>
            <p>I. Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Warcup,</hi> produced
<hi>Lane</hi> and <hi>Osborn</hi>'s Confeſſion upon Oath in <hi>February</hi> laſt, as
is before-mentioned in juſtification of Dr. <hi>Oates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. Mr. <hi>Wiggens</hi> and his Mother proved <hi>Knox</hi> his tampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with them againſt Mr. <hi>Bedlow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. One of His Majeſties Warders, and Mr. <hi>Samuel
Oates,</hi> declared, That the ſaid <hi>Lane</hi> and <hi>Osborn</hi> confeſſed
to them, what great Preferments and Rewards they were
to have for their work, when done.</p>
            <p>IV. Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> (whoſe Pardon paſſed the Great
Seal the day before) did fully declare how and in what
manner he was imployed by the ſaid Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi>
to tamper with, and corrupt the ſaid <hi>Lane</hi> and <hi>Osborn</hi> with
<hi>Knox;</hi> and did clearly make out, how the ſaid forged
Papers were mended and enlarged by him and them, and
that the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> did deliver, or cauſe to be delivered
to the now indicted Perſons, or their Uſe, Ten Shillings
<hi>per</hi> Week; which Evidence was ſtrengthened by concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
circumſtances from two perſons more; and beſides
them, other Witneſſes, which ſufficiently proved the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſo that the Jury, without removing from the Bar,
pronounced them guilty; at which the People gave a
great ſhout: And the Priſoners were committed to the
Priſon of the <hi>Kings-Bench.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Majeſty was graciouſly pleaſed to give Dr <hi>Oates</hi>
an Order upon the Lords of his Treaſury, for the forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
reimburſing him all ſuch Moneys, as the full Charge
of this Proſecution hath amounted unto.</p>
            <p>The Judges and Chief Officers of the Court, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Jury, had that Honour and Eſteem likewiſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104693:5"/>
for the Doctor, and were ſo far convinc'd of the Injury
done him, by being put to ſuch great and unneceſſary
Charge, that they all forgave him his Fees.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>November</hi> 27. Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> appeared at the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi>
Bar, and demanded Judgment againſt the ſaid <hi>Knox</hi> and
<hi>Lane,</hi> which by reaſon that the Verdict was not recorded;
or if recorded, that the Record was not filed up, or ſome
other formality in Law; they could not paſs Judgment
until the next Term.</p>
