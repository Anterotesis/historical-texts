         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>There was a Man sent from God, whose Name was <hi>John,</hi> the same

                  <p>ALL you that lay under the Lash of the late Times,
I cannot forget our Sufferings, nor the Mercies
of God to us, but must needs put you in mind
to be weighty and serious in improving your Deliverance
to better ends, than many of you have done hitherto,
that ye may come to know the things belonging to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65364:2"/>
your Peace, <hi>before they be hidden from your Eyes,</hi>
that whatsoever happen ye may be fitted and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for it, so that ye may escape the Snares of the old
Enemy of Mankind, who is profound in Subtilty, and
hath his Agents about in all places to promote his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Darkness, and Delusions, which are discovered
only by the <hi>true Light, that enlightneth every man that
cometh into the World, which shineth into the Heart of man
to give him the Knowledge of God;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.6,</note> for as the outward
Sun in the Firmament is not to be seen but by its own
Light that shines from it, so God that is a supernatural
inward Light, is not to be seen or known but by his
own Light, that shines into the dark Heart of Man, that
is gone out from him into the fallen state; and as you
do watch and wait for this Light you will see your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
and will be fenced from the Power of this
crooked Serpent, and his jealous Whisperings, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
Insinuations, that have made all the Broyls in
this Nation from time to time to this very day, and
mostly upon the account of Religion.</p>
                  <p>Happy had it been for this Nation, if Religion (so
often pretended to) had been real, without any mixture
of mans Invention; but God that saw that Men were
not fitted and prepared for it, through their own neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
and carelesness, in not being faithful to what they
knew was their Duty towards him and their Neighbours,
upon this account hath the Lord with-held this great
Blessing from many of the great Pretenders and Stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
in matters of Religion as well as others, so as they
have missed of the real and Spiritual Knowledge of this
Ministration of the <hi>glorious Gospel</hi> of our <hi>Lord</hi> &amp; <hi>Saviour
Iesus Christ,</hi> which is <hi>Peace on Earth, Good Will towards men;</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:65364:2"/>
this is truly preached by some, both in their Doctrine,
Lives and Conversations in this day spring of divine
Light and Love, which hath appeared in a large mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to all those that have been faithful to what they
knew of God in their own Hearts and Consciences,
whose Hearts are tender, and brought low before him,
and have given up all their Concerns to him, and can
part with all for him: These, I say, are the Plants of
Renown, and no others, neither can any come to be
grafted into this Stock by any outward Rule or Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of mans contrivance; the divine Vertue must
be in our selves, it is not in the Power of Man to put
it into us, it is the Gift of God in our own Hearts, that
inward Principle that leads to the divine Life, which is
the <hi>blessed Grace of God that bringeth Salvation, which hath
appeared to all men,</hi> as saith the Scriptures, and those
that are taught by it, they do <hi>deny all Ungodliness and worldly Lusts, and do live Soberly, Godlily and Righteously
in this present World;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Tit.2. 11, 12.</note> these are they that are brought
out of the Vanities and Deceits thereof, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Anointing that teacheth them of all things,
so as they need no man to teach them.<note place="margin">1 John 2. 27.</note> But how this
will relish with those that keep People alwayes in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that they may alwayes be paying them, I know
not, neither am I concerned for that; the Gift of God in
our own Hearts is not to be denyed nor concealed; this
Gift is given to all mankind, even to the <hi>Rebellious,</hi> that
the Lord may dwell amongst them, as saith the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 68. 18.</note>
it shows to man his Rebellion against God, and
exhorts him to come out of it; it teacheth Humility of
Mind, and all other Moral, Heroick and Divine Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues;
This Light, Power and Spirit of the Lord God
is tendred to all mankind, as well Women as Men, if
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65364:3"/>
they do wait in Faith and Patience to receive it; this
may be easily proved, first by the believing Woman of
<hi>Samaria,</hi> that carried the Tidings of the <hi>Messiah</hi> to the
<hi>Samaritans,</hi> whereby many of them were converted:
And also after the Resurrection of our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ, he appeared first to two Women, and sent
them to carry the Glad-tidings of his Resurrection to his
Disciples.<note place="margin">John 4.</note> The Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> in the <hi>Acts</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 2.</note> preached out
of the Prophet <hi>Ioel,</hi> to those People that said the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
were drunk with new Wine, and shewed them
their mistake, that they were not drunk as they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
but it was that which was spoken of by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<hi>That should come to pass in the latter dayes,</hi> (saith
God) <hi>that I will pour out of my Spirit upon all Flesh, your
Sons and your Daughters shall prophesie, and on my Servants,
and on my Hand-maids will I pour out of my Spirit, and they
shall prophesie:</hi> This hath confirmed that saying of the
Apostle <hi>Paul, That there is neither</hi> Jew <hi>nor</hi> Greek, <hi>Bond
nor Free, Male nor Female, but are all one in Christ:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 28.</note>
And the same Apostle in one of his Epistles to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. &amp; 14. 34.</note>
speaks concerning Womens Service in the
Church, both of Praying and Prophecying; and in some
other places in the Scripture <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2 11, 12.</note> he forbids some Womens
teaching and usurping Authority over the Man; all
which do no ways obstruct nor contradict what is
formerly declared concerning such Women as have
received Power from God to Pray, Prophecy or
declare the Glad-tidings of the Light of the
Glorious Gospel of Christ Jesus: Much more might be
said in this case, which I do forbear, this being sufficient.
The <hi>Protestant</hi>- Religion forbids expounding one place
of Scripture to make it repugnant to another; see that
remarkable Article of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> called the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65364:3"/>
                     <hi>Twentieth Article:</hi> It is the Subtilty of the Serpent to
expound one place of Scripture to make it repugnant to
another, to uphold such Formalities as he can creep
into; although the Scriptures of Truth be all an equal
Truth, yet they are not all of an equal weight, the
Substance declared therein is of more weight than the
Forms and Circumstances thereof. Our Lord Jesus
Christ the God of glory, hath visited People under seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Forms, and hath left them again desolate and
empty of his presence; when their Forms come once
to be admired or adored, then they are no better than
an Idol, and a cover for Hypocrites. Also, this I have
seen in my time of understanding things of this nature,
which is above forty Years, although the Lord Christ
hath appeared to People in several Forms, yet he dyed
to end Shadows and Typical Forms; our great concerns
are to be conformable to his Death, that we may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of his Resurrection; It is usual with the Serpent
to creep into Forms, but he cannot creep into this true
Conformity, there is no Harbour for him in the Cross,
he is not willing that any should take up the Cross, and
become a true Disciple of Christ Jesus: <hi>It is the Seed of
the Woman, that bruises the Serpents Head;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> (I pray mark
that) for wheresoever this Seed is sown, either in Man
or Woman, that is <hi>sown upon the good Ground,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 31.</note> it will
bring forth its <hi>Increase,</hi> according as is declared in the
Scriptures of Truth, and is there called <hi>the least of Seeds,</hi>
and is <hi>the Day of small things,</hi> which many have despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
for that which <hi>they have accounted to be greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments,
which are but as the glory of the World,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zach. 4. 7. 10.</note> which
the Devil, the God of the World hath shown them,
who tempts Man and Woman at this day, as he did our
Saviour in the dayes of his Flesh, when he shewed him
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65364:4"/>
all the Kingdoms of the World, and the glory of them,
and as these pretended Gifts of the god of the World are
received, they blind the mind of Man and Woman, <hi>lest
they should believe in the Light of the glorious Gospel of
Christ,</hi> who is <hi>the Image of God, or that it should shine into
them;</hi> this is that inward Principle of the divine Light
and Life, which is given of God to man and woman to
be their Guide, to bring them out of their fallen state,
that the Work of the Devil may be destroyed in them,
which is <hi>Pride, Vain Glory, Covetous Minds</hi> and <hi>Corrupt</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Cor 4. 4.</note>
                     <hi>Manners, feigned</hi> and <hi>contrived Religion,</hi> which is <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,</hi>
all which this Nation is much poysoned withal.</p>
                  <p>And further, I shall add this, that the Lord is opening
the Store-house of his divine Treasures of Wisdom and
Knowledge, to all those that do sincerely wait in silence,
that their Minds may be made empty of all Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whereby they may be fitted and prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that inward Principle of Gods love to mankind,
in all Humility and Resignation to him, that his divine
Power and precious Grace may be their Teacher, to lead
them out of their outward Observations into that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Principle of the divine Life, whereby all Gods
Children do govern their Actions; O that ye may all come
to this, <hi>to dwell with God, and he with you,</hi> as it is written
by that Evangelical Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 57. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Thus saith the high
and holy One that inhabits Eternity, whose Name is Holy,
I dwell in that High and Holy Place, with him also that is
of a Contrite and Humble Spirit,</hi> To revive the Spirit
of the Humble, and to revive the Heart of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
One, this is that that all will desire at one time or
other, and <hi>That they may dye the Death of the Righteous
also;</hi> Ay! but this will not serve your turns, you must
come <hi>to live the life of the Righteous first, which is To
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65364:4"/>
order your Conversations aright,</hi> and then <hi>you will see the
Salvation of God;</hi> and ye will then see the destruction of
the Lusts of the Flesh, the Lusts of the Eyes, and the
Pride of Life, and whatsoever is contrary to God; By
the work of God in your own Hearts, and by his inward
and spiritual Grace, Sin will be mortified in you, and
ye will be brought into a serious Consideration and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Contemplation of the Beauty and Glory of a Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Life, that ye may be fixed Stars in the Kingdom
of God forever.<note place="margin">Psal. 50. 23.</note>

                  <p>All you that are like the <hi>Noble Bereans,</hi> that are dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Inquirers of this Age, I shall leave you to search
the Scriptures, and see if these things be not true; for
this is written in true Love to all, but more especially
to awaken those that are asleep in their mistaken Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and led away by the dreaming Conceits of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination:
These are they that have taken up a Religion
upon Trust, upon the Credit and Relation of the Sons
of Tradition, whose <hi>Faith, Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> are
the <hi>Commandments of Men,</hi> making a Money-Trade of
Religion, and Persecuting such as do not conform to it:
Some of these have publickly declared themselves to be
neither <hi>Papists</hi> nor <hi>Protestants,</hi> but true Sons of the <hi>Church
of England.</hi> I desire you in all love, to examine how
far she is degenerate from her first Principle, it may
be easily discovered, if you understand Bishop <hi>Iewel's
Apology for the Church of England,</hi> and also the Principle
and Practices of both these and the late Times, which
differ not much in the ground. I have no Enmity in
my Heart against any Person or People, but desire the
good of all men, and that ye may be truly informed, and
also to remember this Saying of the Wise Man, <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
are the Wounds of a Friend, but the Kisses of an Enemy
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65364:5"/>
are deceitful.</hi>

Wise, but honest, in dealing so plainly with you at this
day, when the Ruin of the Dissenters from the <hi>Church
of England,</hi> is threatned, I my self being one of them;
and also that the Projectors of Self-Interest amongst you
have gotten more Power to destroy, than Honesty to
preserve our <hi>Protestant-Interest.</hi> But to return to my
purpose, which only concerns the ground of <hi>True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi>
The <hi>Faith unfeigned,</hi> which is the <hi>Gift of God</hi> only,
and not at mans disposing, this was confessed by the
Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> when he said, <hi>Not for that we have Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over your Faith,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 24.</note> but as Helpers of your Ioy; for by
Faith you stand; True Faith being the substnce of things
hoped for, the Evidence of things not seen;<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 1.</note> it comes from
God, and leads up to God again,</hi> and hath nothing of mans
contrivance in it: Therefore let all cease from imposing
Faith and Worship towards God upon his People, and
let God alone to be King and Law-giver in mens Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
in matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> towards him,
unto whom alone it belongeth, whose right it is to
reign there in the heavenly Dominion, which gives Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
over Death, Hell and the Grave; they that do
otherways, do but lead men out from God, into Man's
Contrivances, from that inward Principle of the divine
Life, that God hath put in their Hearts and Consciences,
to be the Guide of all Mankind, and is the only Infallible
Way for them to trust to; for this brings them out of
the <hi>Pride, Vanity</hi> and <hi>Deceits of the World,</hi> the other
keeps them in them; so that few of them come to the
true Knowledge of God, but continue in following the
Devices and Desires of their own hearts, <hi>offending Gods
holy Laws until</hi> they lay down their heads in everlasting
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65364:5"/>
Sorrow. And thus is the Creation of God destroyed, by
the craft and subtilty of those blind Guides that see not
beyond their own worldly Interest and profit; but if
men would have <hi>regard to the Commandments of God, to
keep them, that would make them wiser than their Teachers,</hi>
that have been the chief cause of sowing Discord between
the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> and between one sort of People and
another, which have strengthened both <hi>Faction</hi> and
<hi>Atheism,</hi> and will do more and more, if it be not prevented.<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 6, 98, 99, 100.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let these things be weighed in a sincere humble
Mind, which is a true Ballance, left any be deceived by
the false Weights and Measures of those that make a
Trade of Religion, which are the Buyers and Sellers of
the Souls of men; these have been the chief cause that
Hell hath enlarged it self abundantly of late years, to the
great Grief of all sincere true Christians; for since this
Day-spring of divine Light and Love that hath appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so effectually to all those that have waited in Faith
and Patience to be Partakers of it, the old Enemy of
Mankind, which is the great Accuser of God's People in
all Ages, hath raged more abundantly, seeking by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,
Slanders, and Reproaching the Children of
Light, to remove all that may obstruct his Kingdom of
Darkness and Delusions; but the Lord God Everlasting
will more and more break forth by his Almighty Power
to blast the Expectations of all those his Agents &amp; Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that have strengthened man in his Wickedness,
to prevent or hinder the Prosperity of Peace and Truth
in this Land of our Nativity, whether they be Professors
of Religion, or Prophane loose Persons.</p>
                  <p>O Eternal Powerful Lord God! hasten this thy Work, that
all Mankind may fear and tremble before thee: Then shall the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65364:6"/>
works of Darkness be destroyed, and thy holy Power will be
adored more abundantly in the Hearts and Consciences of the
Sons and Daughters of Men, to thy Everlasting Praise and
Glory for evermore, <hi>Amen.</hi>
