            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And so in great peace and quietnesse they trauailed certaine daies without any accident happaning that is worth the noting, till such time as they had passed through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdome of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> &amp; entered among certaine mountaines which wer very craggie &amp; troublesome to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile in, where they chaunced vpon the skirt of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

                  <hi>Sarpedo,</hi> which is verye great, and was inhabited with very furious and vnciuile people. This was the cause which made them to trauaile by the lowest part of the mountaine, where they continued on their iourney till the third day, at such tyme as the Sunne was in the extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest of his parching heate, which caused them to haue an earnest and great desire to drinke, for that they were thyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, by reason that all that daye, and the other day past, they could finde no water, nor any other thing to drinke.</p>
               <p>And béecause the great thirst which the <hi>Empresse</hi> sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned was more griefe vnto the <hi>Emperour</hi> then his owne, hée diligentlye searched in euery place where he came, to sée if hée could by any meanes finde any Towne, Uilage, or Fountayne, where they myght haue water to quench theyr thirst.</p>
               <p>And hée as trauayled in this care and sorrow, within a whyle after hée discouered a certayne valley which entred in by the one side of the Mountayne, &amp; in the middest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there was as it were a sluce which procéeded out of the Mountayne: and it séemed vnto him, that it could not hée without water, for that the ground about it was very fresh and pleasant.</p>
               <p>And presentlye leauing theyr way that they then followed, they tooke the next way which lead them vnto the valley, and with great trauaile they came thether, in the ende whereof they found sufficient of that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they had such néede. For that out of the foote of a high &amp; mightie Rocke, the principall beginning of that mountaine, there was a small valley lyke vnto a medow, being verie gréene and fresh, &amp; on the one side it was inclosed with that mightie Rocke, and on the other side inuironed with great and thicke trees of all sortes, both delectable and pleasaunt.</p>
               <p>This valley was very playne, and out of the cliftes of that rocke, there issued a sweete and a christalline foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of most excellent cleare water, which ran into the middest of that valley, whereas it made a stange: bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

very pleasaunt to beholde. Likewise they saw in that high Rocke, certayne steppes cut out of the hard stone like vnto stayres, which assended vp vnto a dore which was in the sayde Rocke, and it séemed to bée aboue fiftéene <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And this is not the first robberie that these Gyaunts haue committed.</p>
               <p>For that of long time they haue done great harme throughout all the Prouinces that are adioyning vnto this Mountayne.

So in a short space these newes was published throughout all <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and was a meruailous thing to beehold the great pleasure and sports that, were in the Cittie, and generally amongst all the people.</p>
               <p>Then the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> with all those noble <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and Lords dyd ioyne themselues together, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted toward <hi>Dardania,</hi> whereas they receiued the <hi>Emperour</hi> and the <hi>Princesse Briana,</hi> and conducted them vnto the great Cittie of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> with such maiestie and pomp, that neuer Prince nor <hi>Romane Emperour</hi> was so receiued into his countrie.</p>
               <p>And when they were come vnto <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that faire and royall <hi>Princesse Briana</hi> was crowned <hi>Empresse</hi> of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> at which coronation was made the greatest Feasts and Triumphes, with such pompeous solempnity as neuer was in all the world béefore that time.

So in this doubt they remayned vntill the eleuenth day, at which time not séeing the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber dore opened, they determined to goe thether, and began to call &amp; knocke at the dore, but ther was none that answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, whereat béeing more amazed, they knocked hard, and stroke mightie and great blowes at the dore, neuer the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse there was none that aunswered them, although they were there a great whyle knocking: and being much ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed thereat, they straight way gaue the Quéene of <hi>Augusta</hi> to vnderstand thereof, who was in the Citie of <hi>Buda,</hi> &amp; bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very much amazed at that sodayne newes, she called certayne of hir <hi>Knights</hi> &amp; <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> and in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany departed to the monestary.

And as they were in this confusion they found the Letter that was written lying vppon the Table, and directed either to the King <hi>Tiberio,</hi> or vnto the Quéene, the which Letter they gaue strayght waye vnto the Quéene <hi>Augusta,</hi> who with great anguish did open the same, and saw thereon written all the whole Hostorye of the mightie <hi>Emperour Trebatio</hi> and the <hi>Princesse Briana,</hi> with the true relation thereof, till such time as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and in the end of the <hi>Letter</hi> they craued pardon for that they went away in such sort as they had done, without giuing them to vnderstande thereof, alleadging

the reason to bée for the death of the Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> for that the <hi>King Oliuerio,</hi> father vnto the Prince, should not with any reason haue cause to quarrell with the <hi>King Tiberio,</hi> neyther account him as pertaker in the death of the Prince.</p>
               <p>So when the Quéene vnderstoode the effect of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, shée remayned all astonied and amazed, not knowing whether she might giue credit vnto so strange a thing as this was, although to the contrary shée receyued exceeding great ioy and pleasure, for the good fortune of the Princesse hir Daughter, that in all hir life she felt not in hir selfe so much pleasure, &amp; gaue great thanks vnto God for his excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding benefit which hée had done vnto hir.</p>
               <p>At that time the <hi>King Tiberio</hi> was in the Citie of <hi>Ratisbona,</hi> and the Quéene <hi>Augusta</hi> strayght wayes sent messengers, such as shée thought could well declare all that had happened, and by them she sent the <hi>Letter</hi> that the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> had left written behinde him in the chamber of the <hi>Princesse,</hi> and the Quéene remained with hir owne <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women,</hi> and with the <hi>Gentlewomen</hi> of the <hi>Princesse</hi> in the monestary of the <hi>Riuer:</hi> for that it was a place of great qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnesse &amp; pleasure, and sent all hir <hi>Knights</hi> and the rest of hir seruantes vnto the Citie, remayning onely with a fewe <hi>Knights</hi> for hir gard, &amp; other seruantes, such as were néede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for hir seruice.</p>
               <p>The messengers which went with the <hi>Embassage</hi> vnto the <hi>King Tiberio,</hi> came vnto the Court before him, at such time as the <hi>King</hi> was accompanied with all his high <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>Knights,</hi> amongest whome there was that excellent and worthie <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> carrying to heare when the departure of the <hi>Emperour</hi> and the <hi>Princesse</hi> should bée declared in the Court.

And when they vnderstoode all

that this History hath told you, the great admiration that all people receyued, was wonderfull: &amp; when the <hi>King</hi> heard the contentes thereof, hée remayned a great while as one being in a maze, and speake neuer a word. At last calling to his remembraunce the mightinesse of the <hi>Emperour,</hi> the great maiesty of his estate, the worthinesse of his person, &amp; the excellencie of his royall descent, hée thought within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self that <hi>God</hi> had done much for him, in giuing him so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy &amp; mightie a sonne in law, and that his Daughter was the most happiest <hi>Princesse</hi> then liuing in the world, that in the end of all hir sorrow shée had found so noble &amp; excellent a husband. All this and many other things did greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light his hart, but considering how much he was in charge for the <hi>Prince</hi> of great <hi>Britayne,</hi> hée did not make any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shew of his inward contentment, but demeaned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe as one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>And after that he had a great while remayned in that traunce, without speaking anye thing, hée sodainly arose vp from the place whereas hée sate, and leauing all his <hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Noble</hi> men in the great hall, hée intered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his closet, and béeing there alone, hee béeganne again to call to his remembraunce the noble and mighty déedes of the worthy <hi>Emperour Trebatio,</hi> and the more ioy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure he séemed to receiue, giuing great thankes vnto <hi>God</hi> for that all thinges by the working of his mightie hand were brought to so good and ioyfull an ende. And thus all thinges well considered, hée determined to make an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shew of great anger agaynst the <hi>Emperour,</hi> till such time as he might vnderstand how the <hi>King Oliuerio</hi> did take the matter, at such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Likewise at that time came to his remembrance the mighty déedes that the <hi>Emperour</hi> declared of the <hi>Knight of the Sun,</hi>

musing with himselfe who that <hi>Knight</hi> should be that was of so great strength and power, and was very gladde and ioyfull that he had hin in his Court.

                  </gap>ing him vnto the heauens, in such sort that he was ashamed to heare himself so praysed: But as it is a thing most common, that against prosperitie of the vertuous there doth not lacke malicious and enuions persons, who neuer resteth to procure the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their venimous stomackes, it so fell out amongest the <hi>Knights</hi> that were there present, there was <hi>Florinaldus,</hi> hée which the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> did ouerthrow at the bridge before <hi>Albamira,</hi> who for that he was a stout and gallaunt <hi>Knight,</hi> receyued great griefe that the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> should ouerthrow him, and especially béefore his <hi>Lady</hi> and mistresse, and therefore hée was very destrous to séeke to haue opportunitie wherein he might bée reuenged, &amp; make satisfaction of the shame and rebuke which he had receyued by him, many of those nobles and <hi>Knights</hi> that were present were his parents and kinsfolke. And I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was with the great hope hée hadde in his owne strength, or in the confidence of his kinsfolkes and friends, which were verye many, hée determined with himselfe to séeke some occasion of contention with the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne.</hi>

And for that he hath ben hetherto in his company, it is to be supposed that he was acquaynted with the <hi>Emperors</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: and if it please my <hi>Lord</hi> the <hi>King</hi> to giue atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion vnto my words, he should commaund him for the same to bée accordingly punished, for that in no place ther ought to be giuen any credite or trust to traycours, and therfore much lesse in the court of high and mighty <hi>Kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Sonne of <hi>Trebatio</hi> heard these wordes, his coulour chaunged, and with very anger he gnashed his téeth together, striuing to mittigate his cholarike ire by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and to answere <hi>Florinaldus</hi> with patience, but yet this valiant <hi>Del Phoebo</hi> could not execute his vertuous desire, for that his wrath and cholar did much more surmount his calmnesse, which did procéede of his worthy &amp; vexed hart, in such sort that he could not find which way to compasse the same without the great abusing of his honour, especially to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Therfore vpon the same if thou wilt goe forth into the field with mée, I will giue thée to vnderstand that thou doest lie falselie, for that I was neuer traitour to <hi>King</hi> nor to any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. When this stout &amp; gallant <hi>Knight</hi> heard these words, his youthfull bloud being moued, being politike and nimble, with a trice he wrapped his cloake about his arme, &amp; drew out his sword, with the which he would haue striken the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> who was vnarmed: but giuing the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise against the flower of all <hi>knights,</hi> before his sword could descend to execute his will, with a light leap more then thrée paces he auoyded, &amp; drew out his sword (which was a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and sorrowfull drawing out vnto many.) And for that <hi>Florinaldus</hi> had there many kinsefolkes &amp; friends, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of his owne squires and seruants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they altogether drew out their swords, some against the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> and

And procured all that euer they could to wound the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne.</hi> And being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and he vnarmed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he found himselfe in the greatest dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that euer in all his life he had béene in. Yet for all that in this desperate conflict, he did plainely show that he was the most couragious <hi>Knight</hi> of all his predecessours, and of all that followed after him. So that in all the twelue parts of this great historie as <hi>Trebatio,</hi> they haue no small cause to mencion this mighty <hi>Alfebo,</hi> more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other <hi>Knight:</hi> for that this strong <hi>Knight</hi> dyd thinke nothing impossible vnto him that consisted in f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Now, when this couragious <hi>Gentleman</hi> dyd sée him selfe inclosed with his enemies, and so many comming together to discharge and execute their fury vppon him, his wrath and courage increased in such sort, that in leaping forwardes and forwardes, striking about him on euery side, hée chaunced on two of them which came

before him, being seruants vnto <hi>Florinaldus,</hi> so that with an ouerthwart blow he cut the one of them cleane a sunder by the middle, &amp; chaunced vpon the other in the same place, that his sword entred into his bowells, &amp; both of them fell dead to the ground. And not staying, he layd about him on euery side, so that no man dyd endure before him that was vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but hee ouerthrew him vnto the ground, and all that euer he dyd was little enough, for that with the great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and furie which they vsed without all feare, pressing vpon him in such sort, that they hurt him in thrée or foure places, wher at their issued very much bloud.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding what with the great fory hée had, and his exxéeding lightnesse and deadly blowes that hee stroke, hee made the most part of all them for great feare to put them selues apart from him. And hauing space that hée could turne and winde his sworde about him, there was none that was so hardye for to assayle him, but that he cut him a sunder in the myddest.</p>
               <p>There was at that time many nobles and <hi>Knights</hi> that would haue parted and made peace betwixt them, but the tumult was such and so farre out of order, that by no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes they could reforme it, till such time as the <hi>King Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio heard</hi> that great rumour and noyse in the hall, he came forth out of his closet, and tooke his royall Septer in his hand, and pressed in amongst the thickest of them very fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously and with great anger. And when he came where as the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> was, and saw round about him so many dead persons, and amongst them the <hi>Troyan Earle,</hi> with great anger hée layde hold on him and sayd, what is this O <hi>Knight,</hi> that in such order thou d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Then when the valyaunt <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> knew him to be the <hi>King,</hi> and heard what hee sayd, hée forthwith dyd moderate his anger all that euer hee could, and sayde:

it is your <hi>Knights</hi> that doth disquiet your <hi>Court</hi> and not I and if I haue slaine any it is in defending my self from the death, which they doe procure to giue me. Of this sayde the <hi>King</hi> I will informe my selfe, &amp; punish them that hath bene the occasion héereof. And in saying these words he demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him his sword, which he gaue him, more for curtesies sake then for any other thing, &amp; hauing it, he also tooke the sword of <hi>Florinaldus,</hi> and of all the rest that he suspected to be on his partye, and straight wayes called beefore him all his <hi>Knights</hi> &amp; gard, &amp; commaunded them to take the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> prisoner, &amp; to carry him into a strong <hi>Tower</hi> which was on the one side of the <hi>Pallace,</hi> &amp; likewise to take <hi>Florinaldus,</hi> &amp; all those that were on his side, &amp; to carry them vnto another <hi>Tower</hi> that was on the other side of his <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,</hi> so that both the one &amp; the other were put in good kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, but if the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> had bene armed, before he would haue ben taken prisoner, he would haue made the <hi>King</hi> to haue giuen eare &amp; to hearke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And when hée was therin, they made fast a very great chaine to his leg, and for to kéepe him there was put thirty armed <hi>Knights,</hi> and as many mo other men. Then the <hi>Dutchesse</hi> of <hi>Pano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> did send vnto him a very good <hi>Surgion</hi> to heale him of his woundes. At this time the death of the <hi>Troyan Earle</hi> was published throughout all the Court, and there was made for him great lamentacion, for that the most noblest <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Knights</hi> that were there, were of his kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folks. So both the one &amp; the other complayned very much vnto the <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> in such sort that hée was verye much inflamed agaynst him.

whereas the King was, beeganne to powre foorth sorrowful complaynts, destring iustice agaynst them that had slayne hir Husband, and seeing him lye dead vppon the floore, shee threw hir selfe vpon him, and made such lamentation, that it was a heauie thing to béehold, at which sight if the King béefore were inflamed against the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> his indignation dyd the more increase against him, in béehol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the great sorrow of the Countesse, and determyned in himselfe to doo iustice vpon the death of the Earle, and hée ioyned vnto his indignation the great authoritie that hée had to bée called an executer of iustice, (which vnto manie, yea, &amp; very mightie <hi>Monarches</hi> oftentimes is very hurtfull, &amp; the ende of those extremities obtaine them the infamous names of Tyrants.) Then the King commaunded that the dead bodyes should bee carryed out of the hall and buryed, and the <hi>Troyan</hi> Earle was buryed with great honour, and accompanyed with the most noble and principall <hi>Knights</hi> of the Court.

And by this occasion the <hi>Knight</hi> of <hi>Cupide</hi> came vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and saw that hee had lost his way, and was entered into that path, and considering the most part of the day was already past, hee quickened vp his spirits, and trauay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with better remembrance then béefore hée had done, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king great hast to come vnto some place, where hée might haue somwhat to eate, and not suffer himselfe to dye despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately with hunger. So hée followed that euill accustomed way till such time as it was almost night, and it brought him vnto the sight of very high and mightie <hi>Rocks,</hi> which were in the middest of that wildernesse, vnder the which he saw a thing that dyd put him in great admiration which was, that out of the mouth of a caue vnder those <hi>Rocks</hi> there came foorth great flames of fyer, accompanied with darke and thick smoake, which seemed to bée some infernall den, the mouth of the Caue was so great, that a <hi>Knight</hi> on Horsebacke myght well enter in thereat: and béeing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to know what it should bée, hée drew nigh vnto it, but
<pb facs="tcp:13970:20"/>
his horse was so fearefull, that hée could not come so nigh as the <hi>Knights</hi> will was, but was constrayned to alight from his back, and made him fast vnto a trée, and he went a foot towards that wonderfull caue. When hée came nigh vnto it, hée saw towards the right hand ingrauen in the hard <hi>Rock</hi> certaine <hi>Letters</hi> very fayre, which séemed to bée of great antiquity, and hée read them, finding them to be as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This is the caue of the wise <hi>Artidon,</hi> who dyed for the loue of <hi>Artidea,</hi> daughter vnto king <hi>Liberio,</hi> the onely heyre of this Kingdome, who in recompence of hir cruelty doth and shall remaine héere, giuing true aunsweres vnto all that shall bée demaunded of hir, till such tyme as a <hi>Knight</hi> shall come, who with his great bounty and force can ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the terrible kéepers of the entrie héereof, and set hir at lybertie, and then shall this entrie bée frée vnto all those that will know any thing of the wyse man.</q>
               </p>
               <p>When the <hi>Knight</hi> of <hi>Cupide</hi> had well read these <hi>Letters</hi> and vnderstood them, hée very much meruayled at that straunge aduenture, and strayght way it mooued in him a great good will and desire to prooue the same, both to sée and know what was within the caue, and euen as one that dyd abhor his owne lyfe, so hée delyghted not in any other thing but in great and perillous aduentures, &amp; indeuoured to giue the attempt vnto them when hée had opportunitie, but by reason it was late, and that it waxed dark, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to let the enterprise alone till the next morning, for that the night might be a hinderance vnto him for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. And therewith hée pulled off his Horse Bridle, to let him féede vpon the grasse there abouts, and he as one that had no care of himselfe, layde him a long vpon the gréene grasse, and then his minde béegan a new to bée trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with his accustomed thoughts, not remembring that in all the day béefore hée had not eaten any thing, neyther dyd he know where to get any meat to refresh himselfe at that tyme of the nyght, and calling to his remembraunce the cruell words in the <hi>Letter</hi> of the Princesse <hi>Oliuia,</hi> his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:13970:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
heart suffered so great gréese and passions, that tumbling himselfe vpon the grasse from the one side to the other, hee sayde: Oh earth, that for all mortalytie thou openest thy selfe, and receiuest them into thy bosome, wherefore doost not thou now at this present open thy bowells and receiue mée into thée, for béeing buried, I should receiue great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. I know not wherefore I lyue any longer, or wherefore I am suffered in this world, for that I haue lost all hope to sée any more the <hi>Princesse Oliuia.</hi> Oh that this aduenture which I meane to prooue might bée the last, and that I might dye héere within this caue, although the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of my death bée neuer knowen nor heard of. So these and many other words of great lamentation hée vttered, that it was most gréeuous to heare, and passed away a péece of the first part of the night with great sorrow. And the nyght béeing very darke, vppon a sodayne hée heard a noise and murmuring of people, which caused him to aryse vp to sée what it should bée, and hée saw at the foote of the <hi>Rock</hi> a great fire, and round about the same there were a company of Shepheards, and those were they which made that noyse. And béeing desirous to know what they could say more of that caue, hée determined to goe whereas they were, and when hée came vnto them, hée saluted them with very curteous words. When the Shepheards saw him of so goodly a stature, and armed with so precious and rych armour, they receiued him as a <hi>Knight</hi> of estimation, and gaue him very good intertainment, and dyd inuite him to theyr supper, which they had in a readinesse, and after that hée had surrendered vnto them thankes for theyr courtesie, hée sat downe amongst them by the sier.</p>
               <p>Then one of the shepheards, who séemed to be the chéefe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and that had more vnderstanding, and was of a better conuersation then all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rest, did demand of the <hi>Knight</hi> of <hi>Cupide,</hi> what aduenture had brought him at that tyme of the night to that place? The <hi>Knight</hi> aunswered and sayde. I am a straunger in this Countrie, and now it is three dayes since I first entered into this Kingdome,
<pb facs="tcp:13970:21"/>
and for that I dyd not know nor yet doo, this countrie, my fortune hath brought mee hether this euening, and séeing that the night drew on, fearing to bée intangled in vnaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed wayes, I determined to remaine there hard by the Court till the morning, pretending to prooue that aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture when the day was come. And afterward when I saw you together héere, I thought it best to come into your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as well to eate somewhat (for that I am very hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie) as also to informe my selfe of you touching the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this caue of <hi>Artidon,</hi> for till this euening that I did come hether and sée it, I neuer béefore heard any mention therof. Then the shepheards sayd, sir <hi>Knight,</hi> séeing that you haue given vs to vnderstand the occasion of your comming hether, wee will now giue you to vnderstand what wée know, and what at any time we could learne of the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this cause, &amp; possiblie after you vnderstand it, it will withdraw you from this great good will and determinaty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that you haue, to giue the proofe and enterprise. And in the meane time that which wée haue for our supper shall be made ready, &amp; of such as wée haue with a very good will you shall eate your part, for that your person and presence doth deserue no lesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now, that which wée doo know and of long time past haue heard say touching this Caue, is, that in time past almost out of memorie, there was in this Kingdome of <hi>Russia</hi> a <hi>Knight</hi> called <hi>Artidon,</hi> who being a <hi>Knight</hi> of great courage and high lynage, and gentle of disposition, was also the wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest in the magicall art that could bée found in many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. And in the chiefest time and flower of all his Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and science, this Kingdome was gouerned by a Ladie called <hi>Artedea,</hi> who at the death of the King hir father was very yong, but when shée came vnto the state of marryage, thée was so fayre and of so great beautie, that many <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Knights</hi> desired to haue hir for wife, but among all those that in their seruice dyd most indeuour to obtaine hir loue, there was not one of them that in so noble and valyaunt manner did demeane himselfe as <hi>Artedon</hi> dyd, for not alone
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:13970:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in déedes of armes, but also by his science, he dyd mighty &amp; wonderfull things in hir seruice. But his fate &amp; misfortune was such, that the quéene did not onely withdraw hir loue from him, but did also hate &amp; abhorre him to the death: &amp; all that euer he did in hir seruice did moue hir to be melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like &amp; very angry. This worthy <hi>Artidon</hi> had his loue so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely fixed vpun hir, that he would doe any thing for hir de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, but all that he dyd was not estéemed of the Quéene, which was the occasion that after he was fully certified &amp; vnderstoode hir great crueltie, hée sell into a mortall sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, &amp; being without all hope of remedy of the Quéene, hée determined to reuenge himself on hir before he dyed. So on a night by his great learning, he tooke the Quéene out of hir bed &amp; brought hir vnto his caue: &amp; that night there was thundring &amp; lightning, that with the great noise therof, they thought verely the whole world would haue sonke. But in the morning when they saw that the Quane was gone, &amp; could not finde hir, they sought for hir in all parts, but all was in vayne, for that chauncing to come this way, &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that which is there grauen in the Rocke, they straight wayes vnderstoode that the wise <hi>Artidon</hi> had brought hir thether, in reuenge of the great cruelty that she vsed to him. Whervpon ther was diuers <hi>Knights</hi> that would proue the entrie into the caue, and it fell out with them as you shall beare. All such <hi>Knights</hi> as were in loue dyd enter in tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the fier, without receyuing any hurt, but within a while after they were put back &amp; throwen out againe some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Then the <hi>Knight</hi> of <hi>Cupid</hi> said, Lady, vnto god thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test to surrender these thancks, and not to mee, for that hée hath beene the principal dooer, and hée it is that hath deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thee out of this <hi>Inchantment,</hi> and that which I of my part haue done, it is sufficient satisfaction, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue done it in the seruice of such a person as you are.

               <p>The Quéene was very glad and dyd reioyce to heare those words. And when shée saw the excellent beauty of the <hi>Knight</hi> of <hi>Cupid,</hi> who had the beauer of his healme lift vp, shée was greatly amazed thereat, and thought within hir selfe that she could not make him better satisfaction for that which hée had done for hir, then to take him for hir husband. And thincking the tyme long to sée hir selfe cléere out of that place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shée sayde, that if hée were desirous to know the truth of any thing of the wyse <hi>Artidon,</hi> that hée which was kneeling on his knées vppon the Scaffolde was the same, and that hée would giue him the true and perfect aunswere of all things that should bée demaunded of him.

And in the meane time that these two Shepheards were declaring vnto the <hi>Prince</hi> all that they heard, after that the <hi>Knight</hi> had entred into the caue, at that instant was heard that great &amp; terrible <hi>thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering</hi> which was made when the <hi>Knight</hi> of <hi>Cupid</hi> brake the doore of the inchaunted <hi>Quadran,</hi> with the yron male of the <hi>Giant,</hi> at which time the Quéene was set at liberty, which when the <hi>Prince</hi> &amp; all his <hi>Knights</hi> heard that terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; wonderfull noyse, they all suspected that that <hi>Knight</hi> had broke vp &amp; vndone that <hi>Inchauntment</hi> and straunge ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture of the caue, for that it was told him by many wise men, that in his time the Quéene should be discharged &amp; set at liberty.

               <p>
                  <q>This aduenture was finished by the <hi>Knight</hi> of <hi>Cupid,</hi> who did set at liberty the Quéene <hi>Artidea,</hi> and in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce therof ther doth remaine within the wise <hi>Artidon,</hi> of whom all those that are touched with amorous passions, may passe the flames of fire without any impediment, and know of him all that euer they will aske.</q>

When the Queene vnderstood he was the <hi>Prince Luziro,</hi> who was gouernour of the realme in hir absence, she was very glad and ioyfull, and intertayned him with a very good grace, and asked of him how he did know that the aduenture was furnished, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he came so quicklie thether. And then he told vnto hir what the shepheards had declared to him, and of the great noise of thunder which they heard, he affirmed that to be the occasion that they came thether so soone, and after that the <hi>Prince</hi> had talked with the queene, he turned vnto the <hi>Knight</hi> and did imbrace him, receiuing him with wordes of great curtesie &amp; friendship, who was like wise greatly astonied at his mightie &amp; faire countenaunce, which was agréeable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his great curtesie &amp; courage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shewed in that aduenture, &amp; being very desirous to know who y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> stout &amp; valiant <hi>Knight</hi> should be, they requested the queene to demaund it of him, &amp; for that the Quéene heard that which the wise <hi>Artidon</hi> had said vnto him, she strayght waies declared that he was the <hi>Emperours</hi> son of <hi>Greece,</hi> &amp; wondering very much thereat, they could not but looke &amp; behold him with great affection.</p>

And therewith hee tooke his great Fauchon in both his hands, and went towards y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> prince, making a show as though hee should strike him vpon the heade, whereat the Prince stooped on the one side, and the <hi>Gyaunt</hi> dyd stay the striking of his blow, till afterward vnaduisedly at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, he stroke him vpon the <hi>Inchanted</hi> Healme, that it made all them that looked on, to maruaile how hée could sustaine or suffer such wonderfull fury, for that it was sufficient to haue cloue a great rock asunder, but by reason of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his armour, made by that wyse <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> for such necessities, that the Prince receiued no damage of that fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious blow: but by the great strength wherewith it was giuen, hee thought verely all his skull had béene broken to péeces, and therewith hée bowed his knées to the ground, remayning for a good space all astonied, that hée could not arise vp.</p>

               <p>The King when hée heard these ioyfull newes, with a loude voyce sayde: Oh mighty God, is it possible that my Sonne <hi>Clauerindo</hi> and my Brother <hi>Armineo</hi> bée aliue, and that there hath béene in my court who hath seene them, and neuer tould mée till now, and so long time past. And in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these words hée turned vnto <hi>Armineo</hi> and said: Gentle <hi>Knight,</hi> séeing that you haue brought mée so ioyfull newes, I pray you also tell mée where you dyd leaue them, that I may send to séeke them, so shall I haue my ioye wholy ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.

When <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo</hi> had sayde these words, the King was in a great doubt whether this which the <hi>Knight</hi> had told him was true, and whether hée spake it in manner of mockage. The Quéene who was present when shée heard these words, thought it a thing impossible to bée true. Then the King arose vp from the place whereas hée sat, and went vnto <hi>Armineo,</hi> and cost his armes about his neck, saying: O gentle <hi>Knight,</hi> tell mée if this bée true which thou hast sayde, or whether thou boost it to mocke with mée, for that my sad and sorrowfull hart cannot beeléeue this ioyfull newes to bée of truth.</p>

arose vp and came towards this place, and you shal vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that I am the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> hée (if your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse cal to remembrance) that had battaile in your presence with <hi>Aridon</hi> of the black woode, and by reason of a sodeine iniurie which hath chanced vnto me, with certaine <hi>Knights</hi> in the court of the king, I came hether into this forrest this night to sléepe and take my rest. When the Quéene vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that it was the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and knew him by the <hi>Sunn</hi> which hée had vpon his armour, hir ioy &amp; pleasure did the more increase, &amp; thincking hir selfe in a great deale more safetie then béefore, shée said: Now I doo well know &amp; vnderstand that my fortune is falne out much better then I did make reckoning of, for that it hath pleased God to haue so great a care ouer me, as to bring me such a <hi>Knight</hi> in this our most extremitie, and considering the great good which thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming hath béene vnto vs, I cannot impute it, but vnto the goodnes of God in this our necessity. In the meane time that the Quéene was saying these words &amp; other such lyke, certayne of hir <hi>Knights</hi> which followed hir somewhat out of the way from the coach, onely for to spie out &amp; know the way whether they went for to giue the king to vnderstand thereof. So long as they heard the noise of the battaile, they burst not approch nigh whereas they were, but afterward when they heard that the <hi>Gentlewomen</hi> held their peace, &amp; left off their shrikes and lamentation, they by little &amp; little drew nigh vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place wheras the coach was, til such time as they saw the <hi>Gyant</hi> &amp; the two knights, &amp; others ly a long on the ground, some starke dead, and other some verie sore hurt, complaining their misfortune.

And when the Queene vnderstood the whole effect of hir impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, hir body trembled with the feare that she receiued, knowing not how to recompence the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> for the great pleasure which he had shewed vnto them, but desired him to beare hir companie vnto the Court of the King, promising him large and rich gifts, but béecause the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> had a greater desire to goe see the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Trebatio,</hi> then regard of riches and estate, hée gaue humble thanckes vnto the Quéene for hir gentle offer, and dyd excuse himselfe in the best sort hee could, saying, that hée had a iourney in hand which hee could by no meanes leaue of at that present, but hée hoped that the time would come he should returne and serue the King, and bée in his court. So after that they had a great discourse about this matter, the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> tooke his leaue of the Quéene, at which time were come together tenne or twelue of the Quéenes <hi>Knights,</hi> who had hid themselues for fear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And for that it should be beléeued of them which did not sée the battayle betwixt them, &amp; béecause ther should remaine a perpetuall testimonie &amp; memory of the same, the quéene <hi>Augusta</hi> determined to carry vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court of the King the bodyes of the <hi>Gyant,</hi> &amp; of <hi>Egion</hi> &amp; <hi>Farmonte,</hi> cloue &amp; cut in péeces in such sort as you haue heard, &amp; for the same purpose she commaunded the coach to be prepared, shée &amp; all hir <hi>Gentlewomen</hi> came forth therof, &amp; caused the dead bodies to bée put therin, so ther they passed away the rest of the night which remained, &amp; two of those <hi>Knights</hi> did returne vnto the monestary of the Riuer, to giue them to vnderstand of all that had passed, &amp; to bring palfraies &amp; all things necessary for the Quéene &amp; hir <hi>Gentlewomen.</hi> When the morning was come, and all things in a readynesse, they tooke the way which lead them towards the court, carrying with them in their companye the Coach, wherein was the bodies of the <hi>Gyant</hi> and of <hi>Egion</hi> and <hi>Farmonte,</hi> who were very great and bigge, and for that the woundes wherwith they were slayne, were very terrible and wonderfull to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, it put all them whom they met by the way in great admiration and especially when they vnderstoode that one alone <hi>Knight</hi> had done that deede.

               <p>When the Tartarian <hi>Zoylo</hi> had made an end of this his spéech, the king and all that were in his Tent laughed very much at that which was spoken, not for that they did think much in the wages which they did aske, but for that ther sée med to be amongst them <hi>Knights,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if they might come forth

               <p>Now the king commanded straight way perticularly the best and most valyauntest Knights that were in all the Camp should come forth to iust with the thrée Princes, who were in a redinesse a horseback with their speares in their handes, abiding the comming of those who should iust with them.

they had ouerthrowen to the number of fiftéene <hi>Knights</hi> of the most valiantest &amp; worthiest amongst them all.

When that mightie &amp; monstrous <hi>Gyant</hi> that was with the <hi>King</hi> saw him that he was somewhat sad &amp; heauy for that which the <hi>Knights</hi> had done, he commaunded straight way to be brought vnto him a horse which was very great &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable vnto his bignesse, &amp; straight way he leaped vppon him, &amp; chose one of the bigest speares that he could finde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all the rest, &amp; said vnto the king that he would iust with those <hi>Knights,</hi> &amp; bad them come all thrée against him, and that he hoped so to intreat them in the iust, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they should neyther bee able to take wages nor to weare armour. The <hi>King</hi> receiued great delight when hée saw the <hi>Gyant</hi> on horsbacke, &amp; was very certaine that his power and strength was to performe all that which hée had said, yea, if they had béene ten such <hi>knights</hi> together as they were.

               <p>The thrée <hi>Princes</hi> not making any reckoning of his wordes, on horsebacke as they were, went before the <hi>King,</hi> and asked him if he were content to pay them theyr bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine that was made betwixt them, if not, they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part vnto some other place whereas they thought best.

This battaile indured betwixt them more then halfe an houre, in which time they slew of their enemies more then twentie <hi>Knights.</hi> And when those which were within the citie saw all that passed, they thought it best to open the gates vnto those <hi>Knights,</hi> that so valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; with great strength defended themselues, &amp; determined to retaine them, on their part, to help them to make defence against their enimies, for that they did withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues towards the Citie.</p>
               <p>This determination they performed for as these thrée <hi>Princes</hi> did by little and little retire towards the gates of the citie, so when they came nigh them, they that were vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the walles and battilments of the citie, did shoote many arrowes, and threw stones, and other things at their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, with the which they did them very great harme, and made them to retire backwards, by reason whereof they had space for to open a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And they were certified that in the campe of their enemies, ther might bee fiue thousand <hi>Knights,</hi> and vi. thousand footemen. Yet for all that it seemed vnto the valiaunt stomakes of these <hi>Princes,</hi> that they might goe forth, with the people which they had, to giue the assalt and attempt against their enimies. So straight way they commanded that euery man should make him ready, &amp; this being done, they left the citie well proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded &amp; in good gard: &amp; commaunded the gates of the citie to be opened, &amp; they issued out, in very good order.</p>
               <p>In the foreward went these three mightie and worthy <hi>Princes,</hi> and all the rest when they saw them so mightie and well proporcioned of members, and very stout, receyued great courage.

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13970:57"/>So when the <hi>King</hi> saw this great destruction which the thrée <hi>Knights</hi> made amongst his <hi>Knights,</hi> he pulled himselfe by the beard, and blasphemed against himselfe, for that when he had them in his tent, he dyd not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund that they should be taken &amp; put to a cruell death. Then the huge &amp; monstrous <hi>Gyant</hi> which was ther, left the <hi>King,</hi> &amp; pressed in great hast towards that place whereas the thrée <hi>Princes</hi> were: &amp; the first that he met with all was with the Tartarian <hi>Zoylo,</hi> &amp; when he knew him to be the same that did ouerthrow him in the Iust, he was very ioyfull therof, &amp; made towards him. When this aproued and worthy Tartarian saw him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, with a valiant &amp; stout courage, he did abide him: so that betwixt them there began a stout &amp; well foughten bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle. And although the <hi>Giant</hi> was very great &amp; monstrous, and had aduantage by his mightie members, and great strength, yet to oppose against the same, the <hi>Prince</hi> of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie, had very good armour, made by art magicke, in such sort, that by no meanes it could not be cut nor broken. So that he did strike at this furious <hi>Gyant</hi> so mighty &amp; terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blowes, that many times he pearced both his armour &amp; flesh, that the blood ran out in diuers places. At the same time the other two worthy <hi>Princes, Bargandell</hi> and <hi>Lyria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandro</hi> did meruailous déedes of armes, and were all to be brewed in blood, with the great number which they hadde slayne: &amp; were so feared amongst their enimies, that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they went, they made them way. And when their owne people dyd sée the great valiantnesse and worthy déedes which they did, they receiued great courage, and dyd very great harme and damage vpon their enimies. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this dyd indure for a while, yet it could not endure no longer then the whole campe was gathered together &amp; put in order. And for that they were a great number more then those of thec itie, with great violence they pressed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, in such sort, that these two <hi>Princes</hi> could not chuse but perforce they must retyre backewardes. And when the Tartarian <hi>Zoylo,</hi> who was in battaile with the <hi>Giant</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceued

that his companions did retire, he thought it not wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to remaine there alone amongst so many, but at that instant he left the <hi>Gyant</hi> &amp; put himselfe amongst his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, making them to retire in very good order, that their enimies might not do them any harme. The <hi>giant</hi> when hée saw himselfe cléere from his enemie, he was not sory for it, but departed &amp; made no accompt of him, for that his courage was abated in méeting his match. So all those of the citie retired, vntill they came vpon the bridge, &amp; in good order they entred into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> citie. And although their enimies would haue entred in with them, yet the thrée <hi>Princes</hi> which were the last, &amp; those souldiers which were vpon the wals and battil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, did defend the entry so that they returned vnto the camp, wher as they found the <hi>King</hi> very heauy &amp; sad, to sée the great damage which he had receued that day of his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, &amp; the great number which he saw those thrée <hi>Knights</hi> to kill, who before he had in little estima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

On the other side, those of the citie receiued great ioye, as well for that which they had done, as to haue on their part those three knights, with whom they recouered more hart &amp; courage the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before.

And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing determined with himselfe what was best to be done, he commaunded to call vnto him the <hi>Gyant</hi> whose name was <hi>Fulgoso,</hi> &amp; when he came before him he sayd, doe thus which I commaund thee, choose in all the whole campe a thousand <hi>knights</hi> of the best thou canst finde, and in a readinesse with them, &amp; when thou dost see our enimies come forth of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, thou &amp; all these <hi>knights</hi> shall haue no other charge, but to take the three <hi>knights</hi> which went from hence, and bring them prisoners before mee: for that I doe sée that in those three onely resteth the force &amp; strength of our enimies. The <hi>Gyant</hi> who was no lesse wrathfull, then the King, with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good will did promise to accomplish all that he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded. And so he departed from the king, &amp; began to choose out the <hi>knights</hi> that should serue his turne for that attempt, and vnto euery one perticularly he gaue his charge what he should doe. So they were all in a readinesse, tarying the time, when their enemies should come forth.

In this sort indured the battaile more then one houre, and all things went well with them of the Citie, but sodeinly came vpon them the Gyaunt <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goso</hi> with his thousand knights, and for that they hadde no other charge but to take these thrée Princes, they straight waies compassed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> about, in such sort that not one of their companie could come nigh them by a great space. Then this mightie Gyaunt béegan the battayle alone with these three knights, for that according vnto his force and strength they had mough to doe with him, &amp; in the meane time that they were in battaile with the Gyaunt, the knights of the Gyaunt did kill their horses, and in falling vnto the ground they all together charged themselues vpon them, and with the help of the Gyaunt they were not able to make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, neither was theyr great prowesse and strength suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to defend themselues, but that they must néedes bée taken prisoners.

When these thrée Princes saw themselues so carried, with their hands bound like vnto malefactors, they were very heauie and sad with themselues, &amp; knew not what to do, but to haue patience at that sodaine chance and mis fortune, not hauing any other comfort, but to receiue their death with a verie good courage, in what sort so euer they would giue it them.

and the Tartarian <hi>Zoylo</hi> declared vnto him of whence they were, and likewise tolde him of all that happened vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him and his companions since the time that they first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the kingdome of <hi>Lusitania</hi> vntill that houre that they delyuered them. When the knight of <hi>Cupide</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood all the whole effect, he receiued great ioye within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, for that he had succoured his friends in so great a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie. And beeing demaunded of them who hée was, for that they might know him of whom they had receiued so great a benefit hée answered them that hée was a strange knight of that Country, and that he could not discouer nor tel vnto them his name, till such time as hée had finished a iourney which he had taken in hand, but if they were desirous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne and aide the quéene <hi>Lauinia,</hi> hée would goe with them and beare them company, and doe for hir all that lay in his power. When the thrée Princes heard him say those words they were very glad and ioyfull, for that theyr whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire was to returne vnto the Cittie, as well for the succour of the Quéene <hi>Lauinia</hi> and hir daughter, as to bee reuenged on their aduersaries, as of the king of <hi>Balachia,</hi> for that they were verie angrie and wrathfull against him, and béehol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding often and verie much that knight, how hee was ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with all bountie, they said one vnto another, that in all things hée resembled <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> as well in his great valour as in the gentle disposition of his body, and in all the rest of his behauiour, and calling him to remembraunce, and how that they could not heare any newes of him, the teares ran from the eyes of either of them for the loue they bare vnto him. And beeing asked by the knight of <hi>Cupide</hi> the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherefore they should shed those teares, they tould him that they all thrée went in the demaund of a Knight that in all thinges, as well in béehauiour as in proporcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of body was lyke vnto him, and how that the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of him was the occasion of those teares, for that many dayes a gone hée departed from them, and since that time they could neuer heare any newes of him. At this present the Knight of <hi>Cupide</hi> receiued great sorrow and

griefe, in séeing that those thrée Princes béeing of so great valour went in his demaund, and that occasion did so serue, that hée could not discouer himselfe vnto them. Héere may you plainely perceiue what the discurtesie of the Princesse <hi>Oliuia</hi> did cause, for that it caused him to withdraw fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> great pleasure and contentment that hée should receiue in discouering himselfe vnto his friends. So after that they had talked of these and other like things, the thrée Princes tooke each of them a horse o? those knights that were slaine, and they foure together tooke their way towards the Citie, although by the counsaile of the tartarian <hi>Zoylo</hi> they went not the right way, suspecting that when the king of <hi>Balachia</hi> should vnderstand of the death of the Gyant, hee would send some people against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but their determination was not to be séene til such time as they were come nigh vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> camp, and then put themselues into the Citie if neede so required, and in this sort although the King did send his power they should not meete with them, but that they might much more at their plesure come nigh the camp of their contraries, and consulting amongst themselues what was best for them to doo, they determined to giue the assault vpon their enimies sodainely, and to prease through them till such time as they might get the Bridge, and béeing there they were very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that when those of the Cittie should sée them, they would issue foorth and succour them, or at the least waies they would open the gates that they might enter in, and looke as they had determined they did put in practise, and all these foure together dyd enter into the Camp of theyr eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, cutting, wounding, and killing, that it was a wonder to see the great effusion which they made amongest them, and neuer rested til such time as they came vnto the bridge, whereas they dyd defend themselues very, valia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So there they did repose &amp; rest themselues all that day, and all the next following, with a great deale more ioy then at any time beefore. The next day béeing come the knight of <hi>Cupide</hi> and the thrée Princes commaunded that all such people as they thought could doe any thing to arme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnto the battaile, and so in very good order they went forth into the field against their enimies, and ouercame and brake the Campe and slew the King, and the most part of those that were with him, and the rest ranne theyr way, so that those of <hi>Lusitania</hi> remained with the victorie, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued theyr enimies till such time as the night dyd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw them backe, and made them to retire, and it was a thing to be wondered at, to see the great feates and deeds of armes that the knight of <hi>Cupide</hi> did that day, for it may bee sayde, that hee alone was the occasion of breaking vp of the Camp of their enimies, and the destruction of all the whole armie of the king of <hi>Balachia,</hi> so that on the one part as w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

very secretlie, for that hée saw by the determination of the thrée Princes that it was a thing imposible to kéepe himselfe close long, but that hee must bee knowen by them. Therefore hee called a knight of the Citie a side, and sayde vnto him, that at such time as the people were gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and entered into the Citie, hée shuld tel the Quéene and those thrée strange knight<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

With these sorrowfull thoughts that night hée trauailed so long that hée came vnto the sea, &amp; the next day in the morning, hée entered into a Ship of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise, which ariued at that place to refresh themselues with fresh water, and were bound vnto <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Now to returne vnto the thrée Princes, the Historie saith that at such time as they had gathered theyr people together, and would haue entered into the Citie, they found wanting the knight of <hi>Cupide,</hi> and béeing very sorrowfull for his absence they went séeking him, and asking for him of all that they met, till such time as they came to the knight, with whom the knight of <hi>Cupide</hi> had talked, and he tolde vnto them his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And when he had trauailed two miles fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the port, hee saw a far of from him in the same high way where hée went, a great number of Knights, which seemed vnto him that they were in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile they so beesturred themselues, and therewith hée did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his pace to know what it should meane, and when he came nigh vnto them, hée saw that it was more them twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie knights who had compassed about one alone Knight, who was a of a very big stature, and armed with blackarmour, who made battaile with them all, and did defend himself ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie stoutly and strongly, and had ouerthrowen wounded to the ground sixe of them, so that hée séemed to bée a valyant Knight and of good estimation.

When the thrée <hi>Princes</hi> had fully certified themselues therof, with great ioy they followed him so long, that in the ende they came nigh vnto the fountaine of the sauage peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and before they came vnto the fountaine, they found the Horse of the King <hi>Sacridoro</hi> and of the Knight of <hi>Cupide,</hi> which ran about the fields, drawing after them their sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles and bridles, and when they saw them and knew the one of them to bée the horse of the knight of <hi>Cupide,</hi> they were greatly troubled in their minds, and knew not what to say, but looked one vpon another, and seemed that it could not be well with their masters, sèeing their Horsses runne in such sort about the field, and for that they were all of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous strong and stout courage, they did offer theyr liues into what so euer perill or daunger should happen. Thus they went round about from one part to another séeking these two Knights, and in the ende they trauailed so much that they came vnto the great and faire fountaine, whereas they saw the wonderfull slaughter of the sauage people, which lay alongst the ground, and found the King <hi>Sacrido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> stretched vpon the earth, as one that had neither reason nor vnderstanding, but béeside himselfe, with the great sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, wéeping, and grieuous lamentation which hée passed that night past, and all the day béefore, and when they saw him in this case, and likewise the great slaughter made vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that wilde and furious sort of people, they receiued great admiration, and thought verily that the king <hi>Sacrido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> had béene dead, and iudged that hée and the Knight of <hi>Cupide</hi> had done the same, and for to certifie themselues the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

These and other many such words, said this good King <hi>Sacridoro,</hi> lamenting the death of his great friend. When these three Princes vnderstood, that hée was sonne vnto the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> whose great fame came vnto their eares: very much amezed and sore troubled, they dyd béeholde one an other, and knew not what to say vnto that which they had heard spoken. And being very desirous to know to what ende it was spoken, they came vnto the King <hi>Sacridoro,</hi> and dyd comfort him in the best wise they could, and desired him to tell them what was béecome of the knight of <hi>Cupide,</hi> for that of long time they had trauailed in his demaund. So when the King saw the thrée Princes, which as well in their armour as in their disposition sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto him to bée knights of great estimation. With ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny teares and great sighes, hee tolde vnto them all that which had happened vnto him, and vnto the knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> with the sauage people, and in what sort the monster dyd carrie away the knight of <hi>Cupide</hi> into the deapth of that Fountaine. Also hee tolde them that this knight was called by his other name <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> and was sonne vnto the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> and of the Empresse <hi>Briana.</hi> When the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vnderstood that the knight of <hi>Cupid</hi> was <hi>Rosicleer</hi> their very friend, eyther of them receiued so great sorrow and heauinesse, as though hée had béene dead béefore them.

And in saying these words hée slipped forwardes with his féete into the fountaine, all armed as hée was, and with the great waight of his armour, hée sunke straight waies vnto the bottome of the water, in such sort that hee was no more séene. The wise <hi>Artemidoro</hi> doeth write this notable acte done by this king, declaring that the loue and friendship which hée had vnto <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> was the occasion that hée desired to liue no longer, for that hée thought verily hée had béene dead.

And it is not to be beléeued that <hi>Helena,</hi> for whom there were stayne so many thousandes of Gréekes &amp; Troyans, was so fayre as she. Thiy Damsell was apparailed in a roabe of cloth of golde, all set full of fiue Sapheres, with very faire &amp; strange worke, &amp; she had vpon hir head a call made of Emeraudes, in maner of a net, through the which hir yeolow haire was séene, that it séemed to bée thirde of fine golde, and for that she was as white as Snow, she séemed of so great beautie, that no humane vnderstanding was able to comprehende the same.

And before this Chariot came on foote twelue Gyants of a meruailous great &amp; huge sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Likewise behinde this Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot ther came other twelue Gyants, in such order as the first did, but these came all mounted vpon great &amp; mightie hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, &amp; had in their hands heauie clubbes, &amp; they came riding two &amp; two together. In this sort did this triumphant Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot passe by the knight of the <hi>Sun,</hi> with so great a maiestie and high estate, that it was very meruailous &amp; straunge to beholde.</q> When the knight of the Sunne had well behelde all that passed by him, and had contemplated himselfe in beholding that faire Damsell which sate by the knight, hée thought verily that he had ioyed in some celestiall and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine vision. So when the Chariot was passed by and out of sight, he remayned as one blinde and astonied, euen as the Sunne vppon a sodaine should loose hir light, or as if the day should bée tourned to night: Euen so didde hée remaine as one halfe amazed for a while, and as one that had not knowen what had passed, and for that hée would the more better satisfie himselfe of that which he had séene, as one which still remayned in a great doubt, hée bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched his Horse with the spurs and rode before the chariot,
<pb facs="tcp:13970:81"/>
and staied himselfe till such time as they should passe by him againe. Now when he saw that Damsell, &amp; had contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on that strange &amp; soueraigne beautie, straight way his hard &amp; strong hart that neuer was ouercome by loue, was in such sort wounded, that of long time after many &amp; diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult remedies were sought to heale that cankering wound, and he that no humane power was sufficient to moue out of his saddle, was by the shew of that faire sight so troubled in his vnder standing, that his strength failed him, in such sort, that if his Page <hi>Bynnano</hi> had not ben, who did very well perceius his perturbation, and staied him, otherwise as one without anie remembraunce he had fallen downe to the ground, but his Page <hi>Bynnano</hi> very quicklie came to his Lord the knight of the <hi>Sun,</hi> &amp; held him fast in his armes with all his strength hee could, saying: What is this my Lord that before this faire company you doe shew your selfe so feeble &amp; weake: Unto which the knight of the <hi>Sun</hi> did aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere neuer a word, but as one amazed &amp; astomed he knew not what to say. In the meane time the damsells which rode before the Cahriot on their Unicornes, did very much bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the kinght of the Sunne, &amp; he seemed vnto them that he was the best proportioned knight that euer they had seene, &amp; one of these damsells who seemed to be more pittifull then all the rest, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>The Knight of the Sunne when he saw the Damsell, of whom he might informe himselfe of that which he so much destred, comming somewhat vnto himselfe answered hir and sayde.</p>

but now séeing it hath ben your pleasure to haue some care ouer me, I doe most hartelie desire you to declare vnto me what they are that ride in that Chariot, &amp; whether they are going in such triumphant sort, for it may so fall out, in the meane time that you doe giue me to vnderstand therof, this my sicknesse will leaue me, &amp; heerein I shall be much bound vnto you, and if I may require that courtesie. The damsell who receiued great contentment in his company said: Of a truth sir knight, although it will be somewhat tedious to declare vnto you all this which you doe demaund of me, yet I will tell it you with a very good will, for that your beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour doth deserue that I accomplish this, yea, &amp; much more for you.

This migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Emperour when he was a young man was married vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a damsell, who for hir great bountie &amp; beauty was had in reputation for a deuine Goddesse, and béeing with childe by the Emperour, when hir time was come, she was dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered at one birth of a sonne and a daughter, which be those two that are in the Chariot vnder the two rich arkes, and the Damsell is called <hi>Lindabrides,</hi> and the Knight <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> and as you sée hir without comparison faire and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull so is he, neither more nor lesse without comparison in armes, for that in those partes there was neuer séene
<pb facs="tcp:13970:82"/>
knight of so much strength that could compare himself with him, &amp; it is to be supposed that <hi>Iupiter</hi> was neuer so mightie &amp; strong as he is, of whom he is reported to descend. So when these two Princes came vnto age, ther was a great conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongst the kings &amp; mightie Lords, subiects vnto the Emperour, which of these two should be sworne for <hi>Prince</hi> &amp; soueraigne ruler of that great estate &amp; empresse, after the death of the emperour, for that in those countries as wel the daughter as the Baron, if she be first borne, doth succéede in the kingdome, and this controuersie was not onely amongst the subiects, but also betwixt the Emperour &amp; Empresse, for that the Empresse did loue least the Prince <hi>Meridian,</hi> &amp; the Emperor did affect most the Princesse <hi>Lindabrides,</hi> &amp; was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry desirous that she might succéed him in his estate, &amp; in the meane time that this contention endured amongst them, the Emperour commanded to call together all the wise men as could be found in art magicke, &amp; these he charged that they should giue their iudgement, &amp; prognosticate vpon the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of these two Princes, &amp; to declare which of them would best reserue his diuine linage, &amp; his high consecrated estate. Now all these wise men gaue their iudgement, &amp; in the end of many daies the most part of them, especially the wisest, did ioyntlie conclude, that by the off-spring of the Princesse the Tartarian Princesse shoule be exalted, and the linage of the Emperour should be by hir better reserued, for that they found how a knight in a nother Empire in <hi>Europe</hi> should marrie with hir, who should come to bée the most highest &amp; puisaunt Prince in all the world, of whome should succéede very famous knights. Other wise men ther were which did prognosticate the contrary, &amp; said that the Princesse would be the occasion that that high &amp; mightie estate should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed &amp; ouerthrowen, &amp; that hir wedding should be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in all <hi>Asia,</hi> much more then the wedding was that was made with <hi>Helena,</hi> &amp; the sonne of <hi>Priamus.</hi> When the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour &amp; all his nobles did sée the great controuersie betwixt
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:13970:82"/>
the wise men, &amp; well vnderstood their iudgements &amp; prognos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tications, they came to a conclusion betwixt themselues, &amp; did determine that the Prince <hi>Meridian</hi> and the Princesse <hi>Lindabrides</hi> should come in this sort as you haue séene into this great Empire of <hi>Grecia,</hi> for that they found that there was no other Empire in all <hi>Europe,</hi> &amp; that they should tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile through all the kingdomes &amp; prouinces in the Empire. And if it be so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the princesse <hi>Lindabrides</hi> did finde a knight that could ouercome the Prince <hi>Meridian</hi> in battaile, that he should enter into the Chariot &amp; sit downe in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse chaire, &amp; that afterward he should defend hir great &amp; excellent beautie for the space of thrée moneths, in the court of the Emperour, &amp; if in the meane time he found not a knght that could ouercome him, that then he should returne with the Princesse to the court of the Emperour <hi>Alicandro,</hi> and ther he shall be married vnto hir, &amp; made heire of that great Empire. And if it be so that the Prince <hi>Meridian</hi> do trauaile through all these kingdomes &amp; Prouinces, &amp; finde neuer a knight that can ouercome &amp; get the victorie of him in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, that then he should remaine for prince &amp; successour of all the great estate of that empire, &amp; the like preferment should be giuen vnto him, whosoeuer should ouercome him that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercame the Princesse. And this we holde for certainty that the prince <hi>Meridian</hi> shall remaine with the Emperor, or els he that shall succéed him, shal be the best knight that is to be found in all the world. And in this sort it séemed best vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour &amp; all his nobles to appease the controuersie, and the best way that the truest prognostication should come to effect. So the emperour &amp; the empresse being very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent héere with, commanded that this chariot of triumph to be made, with the maiestie which you haue séene, so that it is now two moneths since we entred into the Empire of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> &amp; we haue passed <hi>Dalmasia</hi> &amp; <hi>Dardania,</hi> and <hi>Missia, Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salia, Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Archadia,</hi> and other Prouinces, in the which the Prince hath had manye battailes. And as
<pb facs="tcp:13970:83"/>
yet he could neuer finde knight, but that he ouercame him, &amp; had the victorie with great ease, but now he is very sad and heauie, as one that hath some great care, for that comming vnto the court of the King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> after he had ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Prince &amp; many other knights he was striken with the loue of the Princesse <hi>Florabindia,</hi> daughter vnto the king of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> who is the fairest damsell that euer I saw in all my life, except the Princesse <hi>Lindabrides,</hi> our Lady &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stres, &amp; now the way wée take is towards <hi>Constantinople,</hi> for that it hath bene told vs that ther are ioyned together the most highest Princes &amp; valiantest knights of all the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Wheras our prince Meridian may the better shew his great bountie, for that according as he is of might &amp; power, I doe beléeue the Gréekes shall haue inough to talk of him all the daies of ther liues.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now héere haue I told vnto you gentle knight, all your desire, therefore I commit you to the Gods, and I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, the Chariot is gone a great way before, therefore par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don mée, for I cannot tarrie any longer. And in saying these wordes this damsell departed vppon hir Unicorne, and the knight of the Sunne remained very much amazed at that so straunge an aduenture, and was very glad and reioyced within himselfe for that his sicknesse might haue some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, although he thought that he was not worthie of so great a benefit, yet he had heart and stomacke to giue the attempt vnto a thing of greater importaunce, and did lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle estéeme any knight in the whole world, and yet hée had no courage to conceiue that he was worthie to come to so high an estate, and so hée remained amazed a good while, and by reason that his new sicknesse did trouble him verie much, he lacked vnderstanding to direct him in what hée had to doe, till within a while after he came vnto himselfe, and broched his Horse with his spurres, hée rode forwards and saide. What is this, wherevpon doe I stay, for that I sée it is impossible for mee to liue, if I left to comfort my selfe with the diuine beautie and sight of the Princesse? And
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:13970:83"/>
with this he put himselfe before the chariot with great good will to speake vnto the Prince <hi>Meridian,</hi> and as hée turned his horse for to béeholde that faire face of the Princesse, his tongue fayled him, and as one boyde of reason and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing hée stood still with his horse, without speaking any word, till such time as the chariot was passed by and gone a great way. So when the knight of the Sunne was come againe vnto his remembrance, hee béegan to bee angry with himselfe, for that hée séemed to bée of so smal a courage, and striking his horse once againe with the spurs, hée ouer tooke the triumphant Chariot, and putting himselfe béefort it, hée commaunded the dwarfes to stay the Unicornes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming as nigh as euer hee could vnto the Prince &amp; the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, with a troubled voyce hée sayd these words.</p>

               <p>In the meane time that the Knight of the Sunne was speaking these wordes, the Prince <hi>Meridian</hi> dyd very much béehold him, and it séemed that hée was the best proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned knight that euer hée had séene, although hée had the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb facs="tcp:13970:84"/>
downe, and receiuing no lesse delight at his words, then at his gentle disposition, with a great and seuere counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, hée answered him, saying:</p>
               <p>Sir Knight, I doe gratifie very much your courteous words, as well for them as for your gentle disposition. And I doo certainely beléeue, that your bountie cannot be small. And the battaile which you doo demaund of mée, I accept for that I come for no other thing in this sort and manner as you sée. And in saying these words, hée arose from the chaire whereas hée sat. And straight way two of these Gyaunts which went a foote, entered in, vnder the Chariot, &amp; brought foorth there a horse, the most fayrest and strongest that euer was séene: and somewhat disforming from other horses, for that he had his body very bigge, and the hinmost halfe was all as blacke as any Ieate, and the halfe forwards was as white as the driuen snow, his head was very little, and in the midst of his forehead was there a little horne like vnto an Unicorne: and in his legges hée had foure ioynts, for which cause hée was very light, and did runne as swift and quick as the winde, and as yet there was neuer Horse that could ouertake him, and some saide that this Horse was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered of a mare and a Unicorne, the which they affirme for certainty, as well for his forme and making, as for that they haue in that Countrie of <hi>Scythia</hi> &amp; <hi>Tartaria</hi> many U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicornes, and oftentimes they are séene in the fields féeding with the Mares. To conclude, this horse as well in his strength as in his swiftnesse was the best Horse that euer was séene, and was called <hi>Cornerino,</hi> by reason of the horne that hée had in his forehead.</p>
               <p>They brought him foorth all couered with cloth of golde, and with a bush of white feathers on his head, and all his Saddle was enameled, and brodered about with Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Pearles, the styroppes were of fine golde, and his bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and all the other trappinges were of fine golde and silke, and for that the Horse was very great and faire, and his furniture so rich, certainely hée séemed to bée the Horse
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:13970:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of some mightie Prince. So this worthie Prince <hi>Meridian</hi> did mount vpon his horse, and it was a thing greatly to bée mernailed at, to sée him on horseback with that strange and rich armour that hée brought with him, and his mighty and big proportion and gentle disposition dyd meruailously bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him, and this worthie Knight of the Sunne reioyced very much to sée him in that order, and had great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to sée him. But if this Prince <hi>Meridian</hi> did seeme so braue on horsebacke, what shall wée say of that <hi>gran Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoebo,</hi> in whom all the proportion and gentle disposition of humane was comprehended, for vnto all them that dyd béehold him, hée caused great admiration, and therewith hée béegan to mooue his Horse and to tourne him in the fielde, and the Prince <hi>Meridian</hi> did béehould him very well, and did straight way conceiue within himselfe, that it should bée a Knight of great prowesse, for that béefore hée neuer saw a Knight better set and well made, and hée tooke great pleasure to béehould him.</p>
               <p>Likewise this beautifull and soueraigne Princesse was ouercome by that sodayne and vnlooked for sight, for in lifting vp with great maiestie hir gray and Christaline eyes, shée saw the Knight of Sunne and his goodly proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and gallaunt demeanour, wherewith hir hart did so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that she bare him better good will, and had him in more estimation then any other knight that shée had séene. So these stout and valiaunt Knights did put themselues in a readinesse to the battaile, and what happened therein shall bée tolde you in this Chapter following.</p>

               <p>Oh immortall Gods, at whose will and commaundement all things are roled and gouerned, doe not now shew your selues contrarie in this battaile which I doo determine to make against this Knight, and although hée dooe descende from your diuine progeme, this heauenlie Princesse <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brides</hi> his sister doth the lyke, and with no lesse reason then hée, doth deserue to bée Lady and gouernesse of that mighty and consecrated estate of the Emperour <hi>Alicandro</hi> hir Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               <p>And when hée had said these words, it séemed vnto him his heart dyd reioyce and was verie much comforted. So straight way sixe of those Dwarfes which rode vpon the Unicornes that drew the Chariot dyd sound their Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, the which did make a verie great and timerous noyse, at the sound whereof these stout warriours did moue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues the one against the other, &amp; the great swiftnesse and furie of that Horse <hi>Cornerino</hi> was such, that it seemed hee

could not be séene in his swift course, and the ground vnder him, but although the horse of the knight of the Sunne was not so swift as hee, yet the great hast &amp; fury which his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster vsed made him run with so great swiftnes, that almost in the midst of the course they did meete together, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter was so strong, that their mighty speares were shee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in such sort that the splinters slew into the aire, and these stout warriours did passe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one by the other, and ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them were mooued in their saddles, &amp; yet for all that it seemed that the great violence and force of their horses in their course was nothing abated, but with great lightnesse they turned them about, and these two knights gaue the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault one against another with their swords, and béegan to strike in such furious sort, that they seemed to bée all on fire, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great abundance of sparkles which slew out of their armour, and throughout all the field was heard the great noise of their terrible blows, and many knights which tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled in those partes came vnto that place to sée what it should bee, and beeholding that terrible and well foughten battaile beetwixt those two knights, did stay as halfe amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereat. This furious battaile beetwixt them did endure more then one houre, and there was no aduantage knowen then, and for that the armour of the Prince <hi>Meridian</hi> was the best in all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, &amp; likewise the armour of the knight of the Sunne of no lesse strength then his, the sharp edges of their cutting Swords had not so much force as to enter, neither to vnbuckle their armour, although they did execute their mightie blowes with all the force and strength possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by which meanes they were both in great securitie not to bee wounded, notwithstanding for all that, the great and mightie fury wherewith they dyd strike one another, dyd make them many times to stagger and bee amazed, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most beside themselues and put them in great daunger, and when the Knight of the Sunne did feele the great courage and strength of the Prince <hi>Meridian,</hi> hee did coniecture with himselfe that the Gods were all on his side, so that it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <pb facs="tcp:13970:86"/>Likewise the Prince <hi>Meridian</hi> saide vnto himselfe, without all doubt this is the Gréeke knight which the Southsayers and wise men of my father did prognosticate should bée mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried vnto the Princesse <hi>Lindabrides</hi> my sister, and that hée should descend from high estate, for it séemed him that if all the force of these knights that euer he had battel with, were ioyned together, it was not so much as that which hée onely in this one knight, and both in thought and fury of their bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, they were equall. As this faire Princesse <hi>Lindabrides</hi> did béehould them, shée lost the pleasant and faire colour of hir face, &amp; was greatly troubled to sée hir brother brought into such extremitie, for that shée thought there was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Knight in all the world that might compare with him. At this present the worthie Prince <hi>Meridian</hi> did strike the knight of the Sunne such a blow with both his hands vpon the helme, that hée tooke away the sight of his eyes, and the raines of his bridle fell out of his hands, but straight way this <hi>gran Alphoebo</hi> gaue him his payment, and stroke him so terrible a blow vpon his hard and Diamond Healme, that it made no lesse noise then the Thunder doth in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the aire, when it Thundereth downe the Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt, and troubling his remembrance hée fell forwards vppon his Saddle bow, without other moouing, and his Horse <hi>Cornerino</hi> carryed him round about the fielde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any remembraunce. This worthie Prince reuiued pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, and séeing himselfe so far from his enimie, he set spurs to his horse with great fury, and ran against him, and when hée came nigh vnto him, he stroke him such a blow vpon the healme, that the Knight of the Sunne thought verely his eyes shold haue ben burned out of his head, with the great aboundaunce of sparkles of fire that flew from thence, but the Prince <hi>Meridian</hi> dyd not goe without his payment, for that the Knight of the Sunne retourned vpon him with great furie, so that the one laide vpon the other very strongly, and the battayle béetwixt them dyd endure

more then two houres, in such sort that the Gyauntes and many other Knights which came thether at the noyse of the battaile, greatly meruayled, and dyd wonder with themselues, how they could in any wyse endure so much trauaile.</p>
               <p>Lykewise the faire Princesse <hi>Lyndabrides,</hi> who with great admiration did béehold the battaile, was in a strange confusion in hir selfe, and could not imagine what that knight should bée that was so strong, and with so great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and prowesse dyd maintaine the battayle against hir Brother, and which was of so mightie personage, and of so good proportion. In this sort dyd these valyaunt and worthie warriours contended full two houres and a halfe, and there was no aduauntage knowen of eyther part, but in the ende the wrath of the Knight of the Sunne did so increase, that his blowes séemed to bée of more strength and fury then at the béeginning, but the Prince <hi>Meridian</hi> did con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Knight of the Sunne with a trise did raise himselfe vp againe, and setting againe in his saddle, hée tooke his sword in both his hands, and stroke so terrible a blow at the Prince vppon his hard Healme, and with so great strength, that if hée had not embraced the Horse neck, hée had fallen downe to the ground, and the blow was so heauie vnto him, that hée had thought a whole Tower had fallen vpon him, and when he knew and felt the great force and strength of his enimie, hée lift vp his eyes to Heauen and sayde.</p>
               <p>Oh soueraigne Gods, saue and defend mée from this knight, for that according to his great force and might, and the inuinsible power that hée vseth against mée, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Knight of the Sunne at that time did stand still and not mooue himselfe, but abode still till such time as hée should recouer. The Prince as soone as he was come againe vnto himselfe, tooke his Swoord in both his handes, and with great fury made towards the knight of the Sunne, who seeing him comming towards him dyd the lyke, and in the middest of their course they met together, and raysing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues both together vpon their stirrops, they stroke two such terrible and mightie blowes vpon their healmes, that the Knight of the Sunne ouerthrew the Prince <hi>Meridian</hi> to the ground so bolde of féeling that he moued neither hand nor foote, but lay as one that had beene dead. Likewise the blow which the Prince gaue vnto the knight of the Sunne, was with so great force and strength that hée made him bow with all his body forwards downe to his horse necke, and also hee stroke his healme from his head.

And by reason that hee was chafed in the battaile, his coulour was the more liuelie and amorous, and in such sort that there was no feminine heart of so great force, that could make any resistaunce against that terrible and sodaine blow of naturall beautie. So that when the Princesse <hi>Lyndabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> dyd sée him, neyther the maiestie of hir high estate, nor th valoure of his couragious heart was sufficient to resist, but that shée must néedes bee taken prisoner with his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and loue, in such sort, that many dayes after passed bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could finde remedie for to minister a salue to the

And before that time were accomplished, if it pleased God to send him health he would come thether, &amp; that all thrée to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether they would returne vnto the <hi>gran Tartaria.</hi> Then the knight of the Sun agreed that all should be done as he had deuised, saying that any thing which vnto him séemed good should please him, &amp; that he should receiue great delight ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. With this determination they passed away all the rest of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day that remained, vntill it was time to goe to supper.

And when these foure Gyants did enter into the great Court, all people dyd very well beehould them, and made them way that they might passe whether they would. So they demaunded for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, who beeing certified what they were, they went vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Pallace gate and did alight from their Horsses, and went vp whereas the Emperour was, and much people fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them to know wherefore their comming was, béeing so sodaine. And when they came béefore the Emperour, one of the Gyants saide these words following.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Most high and mightie Emperour, you shall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that in the Orientall regions of <hi>Scythia</hi> the diuine Gods dyd create a Damsell, who is endued with so great grace and beautie, that shée is had in no lesse estimation then a celestiall creature, who is daughter vnto the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Emperour of the <hi>Tartarians,</hi> King of kings, and Lord ouer all the Lords in the Orient. This Damsell is called <hi>Lyndabrides,</hi> and shée hath a brother called <hi>Meridian,</hi> of so great bountie and strength, that it is to bée béeléeued in all the whole world his equall is not to be found, and by reason that both these Princes were borne together at one birth, there hath growen a great controuersie as well béetwixt the Emperour <hi>Alicandro</hi> and the Empresse, as amongst all his subiects, which of these two should bée sworne for Prince &amp; successor of all those kingdomes. And in the ende of many and diuerse iudgements of prognostications and
<pb facs="tcp:13970:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
deuination, it was concluded that these two <hi>Princes</hi> should come into this thy Empire of <hi>Grecia,</hi> in such triumphaunt manner as you shall quickly sée, in such sort, that if there be any knight, that in part and defence of the Princesse <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabrides</hi> did enter into battaile with the Prince <hi>Meridian,</hi> and ouercome him, that the same knight should possesse the place of the Prince, and for the space of two months defend and maintaine the beautie of this Princesse in thy Court. And if it so fall out hée bée not ouercome by any nother knight, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee shall haue for spouse the faire Princesse <hi>Lyndabrides,</hi> and shall bée successour with hir in the great Empire of <hi>Tartaria,</hi> and hee that shall ouercome the other, and make hir defence for the space of two months, shal haue the like. And to the contrary, if the Prince <hi>Meridian,</hi> after that hée hath trauailed throughout all the kingdomes and prouinces of thy Empire, &amp; is not ouercome but doth main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine still the victorie, that then hée should bée sworne for Prince and euerlasting successour of the whole Empire. So that in this sort and for this occasion they came vnto your Empire. And after that the Prince <hi>Meridian</hi> had trauayled through some kingdomes and ouercome many Princes and knighis, the diuine gods did permit them at length to meete with a knight of so much bountie and force, that entering into battaile with the Prince hee got the victorie, and dyd ouerthrow him from his horse to the ground with one blow with his sword that hée gaue him: and that béeing done, hée entered into his place, and béeing readie with the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse</hi> to come hether to this thy court, they first determined to send vs hether vnto you, from them wée should desire to kisse your Emperiall hands, and to request you that you would accept and receiue their comming in good part, for that their intension is for no other thing but to serue you.

Amongst the which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princes did see hir owne face pictured, &amp; next vnto hir, she saw the Empresse <hi>Briana,</hi> and the
<pb facs="tcp:13970:98"/>
faire and beautifull <hi>Oliuia,</hi> at whose great beautie they did much meruaile. And going forwards, they saw the faire &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Lady <hi>Lindabrides,</hi> sitting in hir triumphant Chariot, at whose great maiestie, and soueraigne beautie, this royall Princesse was very much amazed. And turning vnto the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Oligas,</hi> she asked of hir who that gentle woman should be, and wherfore she did put hir selfe into that chariot. So after a while y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had well perused all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was ther to bée séene, this Lady tooke the princesse by the hand &amp; lead hir out of that hall into another, wheras was pictured all the famous knights that hath ben &amp; wer at that present in all the world, &amp; all such as were dead &amp; past, were painted vpon another: amongst the which she saw pictured, that illustrious &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Greeke, the knight of the <hi>Sun,</hi> who aboue all the rest did manifest himselfe, as did apere: &amp; had before him all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole castell of <hi>Lindaraza,</hi> &amp; the great mightie &amp; wonderfull bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes that he had with the knight of triumphant chariet, &amp; the faire <hi>Lindabrides</hi> therin, in the like manner as he was in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> defending hir great beautie. And as the roi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all princes did cast hir eies vpon him, &amp; did consider his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie statnre &amp; gentle disposition, &amp; his seuere cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance, who séemed to bee more a celestiall creature then any humane knight. And ioyning therevnto his great &amp; mightie wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full déedes &amp; prowesse, which was portraied ther before him. She straight way found hir selfe wounded with his loue, in whose heroicall &amp; liberall hart, did neuer enter any humane thought before: was now all onely with that sight, taken prisoner in such sort, that life should first want, before that she should be released and at libertie. And because she would dissemble that new &amp; amorous passion, she asked of the old Lady, who that knight should be, then the Lady, who did wel vnderstand hir thought, said: you shall vnderstand faire prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, that this knight is called the knight of the Sun, &amp; now by another name is called the knight of the Chariot: this is be that doth defend in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the beautie of that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:13970:98"/>
Lady <hi>Lindabrides,</hi> according as I haue tolde you, when you did behold the infant. And as yet it is not knowen whose son he is, nor he doth not know his father nor his mother, but the time will come &amp; that shortly, that they shalbe knowen, greatly vnto their honour and praise. And thus much I can certifie you, thnt neuer amongst knights past of old antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, neither at this present hath ben, nor is, that is equall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this valiant &amp; worthie knight, &amp; his worthie &amp; heroycall déedes will extinguish &amp; blot out all other before his time, and all others that shall come after htm.</p>
               <p>These were wordes that caused the wounded hart of the Princes to be the more tormented, for considering the great worthinesse of his person, and the ielosie that she felt in hir mind, &amp; had of that Princesse <hi>Lindabrides</hi> caused hir loue to be the more greater. And from that present she had great desire to passe into <hi>Grecia,</hi> &amp; to sée with hir eies, that knight whose picture had robbed hir of hir libertie. And shee was fullie certified within hir selfe, that if the knight of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot did once beholde hir beautie &amp; fairenesse, that he would quickly forget that princesse, whose beautie he doth now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, although she should appeare to be more fairer. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing these thoughts within hir, she was a good while &amp; could not take away hir eies, in beholding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> picture of the knight of the Sun, till such time as hauing shame of that old lady, she put hir eies apart, &amp; did behold the mighty <hi>Trebatio,</hi> &amp; his sonne <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> who in his stature &amp; countenance, did very much resemble the knight of the Sun. And for to know who they were, she did aske of the old Lady, and she did tell hir that next vnto the knight of the Sun, that they two were the best &amp; strongest knights in all the world. And how that, that mightie Emperour, was hée whom the knight of the Sunne had taken and deliuered out of the inchantment of <hi>Lindaraza,</hi> as shée had seene in the painting of the knight of the Sunne. So béeing much amazed at that shée had séene, shée remained there till she thought it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit to returne vnto hir companye, for that they should not
<pb facs="tcp:13970:99"/>
trouble themselues in séeking hir. And ther with he said vnto the old Lady, that she would depart if it were hir pleasure, &amp; that she had no other thing to commaund hir. Unto whom she answered, saying, that the might vse hir discreation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though she had many other thinges to shew hir, which shée should keepe close vntill such time as occasion serued to come that way againe, at whose sight she should take great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snre. And therewith she tooke hir by the hand and carried hir forth the same way she entred, till such time as they were out of the caue, wheras the old Lady committed hir to God, and taking hir leaue of the princesse she returned into hir caue, &amp; straight way vpon a sodaine the caue was vanished a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, in such sort, that the princesse could see it no more, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a while amazed at that which had happened she toke hir horse wheras she had left him tied to a trée, &amp; sought out hir company, very glad &amp; ioyfull for that precious armour which she had won, although otherwise she were so farre in loue with the knight of the Chariot, that she thought long to returne vnto <hi>Trabisond,</hi> &amp; depart from thence &amp; passe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Grecia,</hi> for to sée that knight, for she thought with hir self, that hée alone was aboue all the rest of the world, that did deserue to inioy hir person &amp; beautie. And with this great desire she trauailed, till such time as by the sound of hir horne hir knights came vnto hir, who meruailed to sée hir armed with that precious and rich armour, &amp; did receiue hir with great ioy &amp; pleasure for that they had gone about seeking for hir a good while, complayning very much for hir absence, for that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And béeing very importunate with mée therein, I was constrained of necessitie to declare vnto him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I was made sure vnto the Prince <hi>Lusindo,</hi> and how that hée was my spouse and husband.

And béeing determined to make the third encounter, &amp; ready to take their course, ther entred into the middest of the place, a dwarffe, the least &amp; the most ill fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redst that euer was seene, who came riding vpon a roane Horse, &amp; brought in his hands two speares all g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This speare is sent vnto you by a wise man, who hath great desire to serue you, &amp; doth send it you, for to iust with this <hi>Knight</hi> who is before you. And he doth giue you to vnderstand, that therwith you shall make such an entounter, that all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> force and strength thereof, shall returne against your selfe, &amp; shall passe through your mighty &amp; stout hart, and death shall first conclud with you, before that wound be healed. And when he had said these words, the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> did receiue the speare, &amp; was very much amazed at the words that he heard spoken. And without any more saying, the dwarffe departed from him, &amp; went vnto the strange <hi>Knight,</hi> &amp; gaue vnto him the other speare which he brought, &amp; said: This speare a wise man doth send it vnto you for to iust with the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> &amp; he doth giue thee to vnderstand, that at this encounter thou shalt ouercome thy contrary, &amp; shalt make him to lose the name which now he hath, &amp; thou shalt remaine wounded for euer. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had made an end of saying these words, not staying any longer, but strake his Horse with his whip, &amp; returned the way back againe, wher he came. And all men remained very much amazed: but much more the knight of the Chariot &amp; the strange <hi>knight,</hi> &amp; could not vnderstand to

what end those words were spoken, but left their speares which they had &amp; toke the speares which the Dwarffe had brought them, and spurring their Horses they began to run one against another with great fury, &amp; in the midst of their swift course, at such time as all people did behold them, &amp; lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king what should bée the end of their encounter: the two worthy knights did encounter very strongly together, &amp; ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them chanced to strike one another vpon the beauers of their helmes. Now whether it was hap or fortune, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those guilt speres did work by art or instuence,, I know not, but both these <hi>knights</hi> did fall backwards, &amp; strok their heads vpon their horses croupers, &amp; the lasings of both their helmes did faile, &amp; they fell from their heads. But straight way they setled themselues vpright againe, &amp; as you see that shining <hi>Sun</hi> &amp; the faire <hi>Diana,</hi> when they doe appeare: euen so séemed the faces of these two <hi>knights,</hi> for that the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> did shew that perfect &amp; seuere countenance, which vntill that time not one that was in all that place had seene. And of the other part, the strange <hi>knight</hi> did séeme to be the soueraine, &amp; without comparison in beauty, that faire, <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana,</hi> whose Rubicomde haire which séemed to bée of fine gold fell loose &amp; spred about hir eares, &amp; hanged ouer all hir backe, parted in the midst, as though it had ben don by a compasse, showing hir celestiall face, which seemed vnto all people, to be some diuine creature. What should I say vnto that faire <hi>Medusa</hi> who did transport men into stones, yet was shee not to be compared to this royall princesse, who with hir celestiall &amp; faire countenance did put all those that were in that place, in great &amp; strange admiration, &amp; almost astomed and amazed, not beléeuing to the contrary, but it should bee some diuine vision: So that the faire Pincesse <hi>Lindabrides</hi> could not with much reason blame hir
<hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> if that hée were wounded by that mighty &amp; strong blow, &amp; that the true &amp; perfect loue which hée bare vnto hir, should bée somewhat troubled.

for that the force thereof was such, that he was not able to make any resistance, but that his hart was clouen asonder in the midst, &amp; the one halfe remained rotted as before it was. And the other half he did yéeld vnto that soueraigne princes that was before him. So straight way when he felt himselfe wounded, he considered of the words which the dwarfe had spoken, &amp; knew that they fel out to be true, not knowing what to say vnto that straunge aduenture which happened vnto him. But when the royal princes did sée that pleasant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce, whose all onely picture did wound hir vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hart, &amp; made hir to come into those parts, the ioy &amp; pleasure which she receiued, I am not able to expresse: and hir loue did the more increase, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it seemed vnto hir, that by a great deale, that royall presence that she had before hir, might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vnto the figure which she saw in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mountaines of <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas.</hi> Then the knight of the <hi>Sun</hi> went vnto hir &amp; said, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy gentlewoman, shew vs I pray you so much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Then the princes with a merry and cherefull countenaunce, did answere him and said. Worthie knight, your great valour doth constraine and force mée to giue you to vnderstand of all that you doe aske, although when I came vnto this court it was with intent, not to giue my selfe to bée knowen. You shall vnderstand that I am called <hi>Claridiana,</hi> and I am daughter vnto the Emperour of <hi>Trapisond,</hi> and of the Empresse his wife, who in hir time did exercise military knighthood: &amp; for that the great fame of your high prowesse doth so far extend in the world, I departed out of <hi>Trapisond</hi> for to come into these parts, not for any other purpose, but to proue my selfe with you. And now I doe thinke my trauaile well bestowed that I haue taken, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I doe know so mightie &amp; strong a knight.</p>

My Lord, answered the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> I do acknowledge my errour wherin I haue erred, yet I am worthy to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned of your highnesse, for that loue hath ben the occasion héereof, &amp; it may please your highnesse to speake vnto this damsell, who is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soueraigne princesse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> &amp; daughter vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> emperour of <hi>Trabisond.</hi> When the emperour vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood therof, for that before he knew nothing, being very much amazed, he went towards hir. When the princesse saw them comming, she did alight from hir horse, &amp; receiued them both with a meruailous, great, &amp; dutifull reuerence. And the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour began first to speake vnto hir, and said.</p>

And in saying these words, the valiant knight of <hi>Cupid,</hi> stroke his furious horse with the spurs, &amp; returned vpon the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> &amp; with so cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious force, hee stroke so terrible a blow, with his hands, vpon his rich &amp; precious helme, that the sound thereof was heard through all the Citie of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> &amp; was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged so much therwith, that he thought verely that his eyes and all the téeth in his head were broken, by the great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of bloud that issued out from the lasing of his helme. And his horse <hi>Cornerino,</hi> did founder vnder him, with the great force and wayght of the same blow, &amp; so remayned a good while, &amp; could not arise, till such time as the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> with great fury did quicken him with his spurs: &amp; said within himselfe, that with great reason the <hi>Knight</hi> of <hi>Cupid</hi> was so praysed in the court, for that ther was neuer <hi>Knight</hi> or <hi>Gyant,</hi> that euer did bring him into that extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. So ther againe these valiant warriors did returne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their battaile, with so furious brauenesse, that all those which did behold them, were greatly amazed, musing how that two humane bodyes could endure so long, and suffer so great torment. And with great reason they saide, that those two <hi>knights</hi> was the flower of all the <hi>knights</hi> in the world.</p>
               <p>The Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> being very much amazed to sée the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> in that extremity, hée said vnto the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>Claridiana.</hi> Oh who had séene the high &amp; mighty <hi>knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> that was done by the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> in the Iland of <hi>Lindaraza,</hi> vpon the monstrous giants &amp; wild beasts, &amp; the great prowes done against so many worthie <hi>knights,</hi> as well in this court, as in other places, that séemed to be done by some diuine prouidence, rather then by any humane knight. And now to sée him in so great danger to be ouercome by one alone <hi>Knight,</hi> surely it is a strange thing, &amp; to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at. Of a truth, said the faire princes, they which haue not séene, cannot well beléeue it, but yet it séemeth vnto me that the <hi>knight</hi> of <hi>Cupid</hi> should be such a <hi>Knight,</hi> that wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

hée is knowen he is had in the like reputacion, as the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> is with you.</p>
               <p>In this time the valiant <hi>knights</hi> neuer seased, neither were they weary, although more then two houres they combatted together, but séemed rather with more force &amp; fury, then at the beginning, they did perseuer in the strong battaile, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the one the other with so great fury, that many times their heauy blowes did astony them, as well the one as the other, &amp; brought them both vnto the point to be ouercome.</p>
               <p>Which was the occasion that their stout couragis did ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more strength, &amp; their strong armes the more force: &amp; made either of them to think, that it were better to be slaine then to be ouercome, before them, whom they did combatte, which was the occasion, that their battaile was of a great deale more force then at the beginning. And againe, if their horses had not ben the best in all the world, they could not haue caried them, neither haue suffered the great trauaile, which their maisters put them vnto, with entring in, &amp; rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring backe, with the Arong &amp; heauy blowes which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, &amp; the light leapes &amp; springes which they gaue, forced by their sharpe spurs was sufficient to haue weried them: but by reason that their horses were so good, &amp; their armour so suer, all the state of the battaile remained in the force &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And as the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> at that tyme did behold the faire Princesse <hi>Lindabrides,</hi> and saw hir to bée so sadde and lost all hir coulour, he suspected the occasion to be in the perill of the battayle.

<pb facs="tcp:13970:121"/>
that his Horse caried him about that great place, and all men did loke when he would haue fallen from his Horse to the ground.</p>
               <p>And for that the <hi>Knight</hi> of the sun did think that he had ben dead, he did leaue to follow him. But yet hée had not conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to giue a compasse round about with his Horse, in signe of victory, when the good <hi>Knight</hi> of <hi>Cupid</hi> was wholy come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to himselfe, &amp; was setled in his saddle, and recouering his sword which he had lost by the strength of that blow w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great fury he spurred his great and furious Horse, &amp; went towards the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and setling himselfe vpon his stirrops, he stroke him such a blow vpon the shoulder, that if his inchanted armour had not ben such, without all doubt, he had clouen him vnto the Horse saddle. But by reason that they were so strong, his sword made no more signe on him, then if he hadde stroke vpon an anfield of stéele. Yet for all that the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> was so charged with that blow, that if hée had not imbraced himselfe about his horse neck, hée had fallen downe vnto the ground.</p>
               <p>Oh how great was the wrath which the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> receiued, in séeing himselfe brought into so great extremity, before the royall and beautifull Princes <hi>Claridiana,</hi> and the faire princesse <hi>Lindabrides.</hi> It caused the fury of his mortall blowes to double, and to be angry with himselfe, for that one alone <hi>Knight</hi> should so long endure against him.</p>

And the same, that if all the <hi>Knights</hi> in that place should moue attempt agaynst him, his valiaunt and couragious heart should not faile him one iotte.

which caused him to execute these rigorous blowes, with so great force, that it made the knight of the <hi>Sun,</hi> to wonder at his great strength. At this time the one was knowen so well to the other, that the end of the battell was very doubtfull, for that the greatest part of the day was past, wherein the valiant &amp; worthy <hi>knights</hi> had combatted, &amp; no lesse vantage to be iudged betwixt them then at the beginning. At which the Emperour &amp; the princesse &amp; all the rest of the <hi>knights</hi> &amp; Ladies that were in the pallace, very much meruailed, and said that the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> had met with his match. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the valiant king <hi>Sacridoro,</hi> for that he knew the great force &amp; strength of the <hi>Knight</hi> of <hi>Cupid,</hi> was greatly ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed that the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> should so long endure with him, &amp; said vnto himselfe: Surely not without great reason the high bounty of the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Chariot</hi> is extolled, that he alone doth maintaine himselfe against him, that the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage people of the inchanted fountaine could not endure one halfe houre, and against him that the fierce Tiger and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Gyant, which were kéepers of the Prince <hi>Lusindo,</hi> could not make any resistance. And in saying these words hée desired God of his goodnesse to graunt the victory vnto his perfect friend, for that beefore the Emperour <hi>Terbatio</hi> &amp; Empresse <hi>Briana,</hi> his father and mother, hée might not bée disgraced, which would bée the occasion that hée should neuer come more beefore them. In this time the blowes of these two valiant <hi>Knightes</hi> were so rigorous, that all those which did beholde them were greatly amazed, and two miles about that place was the noise of their blowes heard as though it had ben thunder, putting the hearers in great feare, and the lookers one waxed wery, but they séemed with new force to begin the battell againe. So in this sort these valiaunt <hi>Knightes</hi> did perseuer in their rigorous battayle, without any ceasing, but still executing their terrible blows the one vpon the other, till more then sixe houres were past since the beginning of their combat, and it séemed that the Sunne would seperate the battaile, for that she

began to withdraw hir selfe into the occidentall Regions. At this time it séemed vnto the <hi>knight</hi> of <hi>Cudid,</hi> that in all that day he had done very little, and that the day was almost spent, being very angry with himselfe, hée said.</p>

               </p>
               <p>So these valiant <hi>Knights</hi> saying these &amp; other words vnto themselues, did so much animate their couragious stomacks, that eight houres<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were past since the beginning of their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous battaile, &amp; at that time their wonderfull blowes sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be with more force &amp; strength, and their horses with their great &amp; continuall labour waxed weary, but these two valiant <hi>knights</hi> at that time séemed to fight with new force &amp; strength, &amp; neuer ceased striking one another such terrible blowes, that the standers by had their eares filled with the sound of their fine tempered armour, and were so greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed to sée the great trauaile that they suffered in that bartaile, &amp; likewise to sée with what great force &amp; strength they did execute the same, in the end of long time that they had indured, &amp; séemed that ther was neuer done by them the like prowesse nor actiuitie, as was done at that prelent, as truth was, for that neither of them in all their liues was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer brought into the like extremity or perill, as they wer in this battaile, nor neuer had the like feare to be ouercome. But the great shame &amp; reproch, with the iealousie of their honor, did so much touch either of them, that it made them without feeling any trauaile to procure all that in them lay for to get the victory, or ele to die in the demaund. So at this time the golden <hi>Diana</hi> began to shew hir light in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entall Regions, and the worthy <hi>Knight</hi> of <hi>Cudid</hi> not estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his owne life, if hée should not get the victory of the Knight of the Sunne, with both his hands, raising himselfe in his stirops, hée stroke him so terrible a blow, that it did depriue him of his vnderstanding, &amp; made him to fall back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vpon the backe of the saddle, that his head touched the horse crouper, and his weary Horse carried him about that great place, in such sort, that all those which saw him,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:13970:123"/>
thought that hée had béene dead. But when the Princesse <hi>Claridiana</hi> did sée him in that plight, hir blood waxed could within hir body, and béeing sore troubled, shée asked the Emperour if hée were dead or no, but hée was at that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull blow so troubled, that hée had no power at all for to answere hir, but whosoeuer at this time had séene the face of the faire Princesse <hi>Lindabrides,</hi> would haue knowen by hir coulour the great loue that shée did beare vnto him, but at such time as the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> did come agayne vnto himselfe, there was neuer <hi>Lion</hi> nor furious beast more outragious then hée was, and considering the great danger and perill that hee was in, his out ragious heart was so full of mortall anguish, with vnmeasurable wrath, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hée stroke his light horse with the Spurs, and crushed his téeth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it séemed sparkes of fire procéeded from his eyes, and like vnto a whirle winde hée ran towards the <hi>Knight</hi> of <hi>Cupid,</hi> who seeing him recouered againe, made likewise against him with so great fury, that the ground where his Horse dyd runne séemed to tremble: Oh how great was the feare which the fury of these valyaunt <hi>knights</hi> caused in them that did béehold their mortall wrath, comming the one against the other, terrifying their vnderstanding to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide the end of their mortall blowes. I doo beleeue certainly that ther was not one <hi>knight</hi> in all that place, of what force and strength so euer hée was, that séeing the fury of those valiant <hi>knights,</hi> but hée would haue béene terrified, neither was there any friend, although hée had béene fully satisfied of the bountie of any of them, but would haue prayed vnto God for them, séeing them in that great perill. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> with the great loue that hée bare vnto the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and the desire that hée had to know the <hi>knight</hi> of <hi>Cupid,</hi> receiued no lesse feare then all the rest, and sayd.</p>
               <p>Oh mightie God, thou who madest these <hi>Knights</hi> of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I praie and desire thee to aide and succour them, and let them not execute theyr great wrath the one vppon the other, neyther doe not permit that the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi>

bée slaine béefore hée doo acknowledge thy great power, and turne vnto thy lawes, that his soule bee not condempned to immortall paine. So the swift course of theyr furious Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses ioyned theyr encounters, and the two wrathfull <hi>Knights</hi> raysing themselues in theyr stirrops, pretending to make an end of theyr long and doubtfull battell, with the extremitie of all theyr force and strength, they stroke one another with so great wrath vpon theyr fine Helmes, that although the fine edges of theyr mightie cutting swoords could not enter nor cut theyr inchanted armour, yet these valiaunt <hi>Knights</hi> were so ouerlayd with the great might and power of theyr blows, that the <hi>knight</hi> of <hi>Cupid</hi> was constrained to decline himselfe on the one side, and therwith hee fell downe to the ground, wheras he lay, and mooued neither hand nor foot, but was as one that were dead, and the inuinsible <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> by the force of the blow was cleane voide of any vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and had likewise fallen to the ground if Fortune had not fauoured him, that he fell forwards vpon the saddle bow, that his head touched the Horse necke, and his armes hung downe on both sides, and voyded great abundance of blood out of his mouth &amp; eyes, in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> such sort, that they thought him likewise to bée as dead as the <hi>Knight</hi> of <hi>Cupid,</hi> and his horse beeing tormented with that terrible blow did founder vnder him, and remained without any moouing, as though the bones of his legges had béene broken. At which sight all those that were in that great place, receiued so great sorrow and griefe at the extremitie of these two valiant <hi>Knights,</hi> that thinking they had béene dead, they lamented as though they had béene theyr naturall bretheren. But the Princesse <hi>Lindabrides</hi> when shée saw hir <hi>Knight</hi> in that estate, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any power to resist so mortall a griefe, had not the power to gouerne hir selfe, but fell in a sound, &amp; had fallen out of hir Chaire wheras shée sat, if hir Gentlewomen had not ben, who séeing hir in that case, tooke hir in their armes, and carryed hir into hir closet, and laide hir vppon hir bed,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:13970:124"/>
whereas shée had more semblaunce to bée dead, then as one hauing any lyfe.</p>
               <p>Likewise the Princesse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> with no lesse paine and griefe did béeholde hir <hi>knight,</hi> who with the mightinesse of hir couragious heart did make resistance against that amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thought which loue caused within hir. Who with no lesse sorrow and griefe when hée saw the <hi>Knights</hi> in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie, and as though hée had knowen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bee his sons, hée withdrew himselfe from the window, &amp; descended downe into the great place, accompanied with many <hi>Knights,</hi> hée went whereas these <hi>knights</hi> were, and found that they were compassed about with their perfect friends, the two Princes and the king <hi>Sacridoro,</hi> who lamented with great abundance of teares, and caused theyr Helmes to bee pulled of, and to throw water in theyr faces, thinking therewith and with the aire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they would come againe to themselues, but all was in vaine that they did, for that there was in them no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther signe, but as though they had béene starke dead. For which occasion &amp; with dolorous griefe the Emperour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded them to bée carried vnto his Royall Pallace, and caused their armour to bée taken off, and to bée laide in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall beds, which was in two quadrans, very richly hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ioyning the one vnto the other.</p>
               <p>Then were called together the best Hhisitions and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions that were in all the whole citie of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who did béehold and peruse them very well, &amp; tolde vnto the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> that they were not dead, although they were in great peril of their liues. Who being somwhat comforted therby, commaunded that foorth-with theyr faces should be washed and made cleane, that were all to bée rayed with boold, and swollen, and did not a little meruaile in their mindes when they saw the great beautie of the <hi>Knight</hi> of <hi>Cupid,</hi> and the small quantitie of yeeres which hée séemed to haue. And how that hee resembled very much the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13970:125"/>
and hée had so great loue vnto both those <hi>Knights,</hi> that hée would haue giuen halfe his estate to haue seene them out of that great perill. So after the Phisicions and Surgions had well perused them, they found that the greatest euill which they had, was wearinesse of theyr bodies, and all their bones and flesh brused, by the mightie force of theyr terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blowes. So they ministered vnto them very swéet and comfortable ointments, and all that was necessay for them and most conuenient, and commaunded that euerie man should depart from thence and lette them alone, that they might sléepe and take theyr rest, with onely two Pages, which were in another chamber ther by with great silence, that whensoeuer these <hi>knights</hi> should come vnto themselues they should call the Phisitions and Surgions. In this time there was not a <hi>knight</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> neither in that great place, nor in their Tents in the field, as well straungers and Countrie men, that did occupie themselues in any other communication, but in the wonderfull and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous battaile of these two <hi>Knights,</hi> and of their mightie blowes, perticularly euery thing as it was, and sayde, that there was neuer seene in all the world such lyke contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on béetwixt two <hi>knights,</hi> with so great strength, force, and perill, neyther was any Damsell or Gentlewoman that saw the perill of these two <hi>Knights,</hi> but dyd verie much lament the same, and sayde, that if these two <hi>Knights</hi> dyd die, that the flower of all <hi>knighthood</hi> in the world was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished and ended. But in this time what dyd those two Princes <hi>Brandizel</hi> and <hi>Claueryndo</hi> and his verie friend <hi>Florinaldus?</hi> Surely no other thing all that night but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for theyr very friend the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and making so great sorrow, that it would haue mooued anie to haue had compassion that should haue heard them. But what shall I say of that valyaunt and worthy King <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doro,</hi> his perfect friend, that when the night was come, hée found himselfe all alone in that great place, without the companie of his very friend the <hi>Knight</hi> of <hi>Cupid,</hi> and not knowing where to lodge himselfe, surely his sorrow and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:13970:125"/>
griefe was such, that if hée thought to finde his friend the <hi>Knight</hi> of <hi>Cupid</hi> in the profound depth of the sea, hée would haue throwen himselfe therin, as hée did into the déepe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the sauage people, for to take reuengement on that monster who carryed his friend away. So hée went foorth of the Citie, and béeing in the fields hee dyd alight from his horse, &amp; laid himselfe downe vpon the gréene grasse, whereas hee passed away all that night, with great lamentation, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayling y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> misfortune of his perfect friend. The history doth not declare any thing of the faire Princesse <hi>Lindabrides,</hi> but that shée passed all that night in sorrow and griefe. But hée saith that the princesse <hi>Claridiana</hi> when she was alone in hir chamber, there was no sufficiencie in the highnesse of hir e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, neither in the generositie of hir couragious hart, for to draw hir fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the lamenting of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> misfortune of hir <hi>knight,</hi> in such sort, that all the night she did no other thing but shed abundaunce of teares which ranne downe by hir Christall chéekes, and spake such lamentable and sorrowfull words, that it séemed hir life could not haue endured till the next day, if it had not pleased God to haue giuen remedy therin, as in the next Chapter shall bée declared.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The two pages which was in another quadran hard by to watch them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the noise which the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> did make at such time as he arose out of his bed, they did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, &amp; heard all that passed betwixt the two <hi>Knights:</hi> who being almost from themselues with the great ioy &amp; pleasure they receiued, they toke a torch that was light in that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dran, &amp; without making themselues ready, they went run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto the place wheras the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> &amp; the empresse <hi>Briana</hi> lay, &amp; were a sléepe. And neuer rested knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; giuing great blowes at the dore, till such time as they were answered by the gard, that kept them. And the pages in great hast willed them to open the dore, for that they brought vnto the Emperour, the most ioyfullest newes that euer in all his life he receiued.</p>
               <p>The gard who did know the pages by their speach béeing very much amazed therat, did open the dore, and they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any staying, went in with the burning torch in their hands, wheras the Emperour &amp; the empresse were a sléepe, and with a high and loud voice, they sayd: Oh high &amp; migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> and you soueraigne Empresse <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> arise vp from your beads, and you shall sée the <hi>knight</hi> of the sun and the <hi>knight</hi> of <hi>Cupid</hi> aliue.

               <p>So when the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> and the Empresse <hi>Briana</hi> heard that newes of so great ioy and pleasure, without any more tarrying, they arose out of their beds, and couered them selues with certaine mantells, which were very rich, and in great hast they forthwith went <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

although she had not séene him of long time: &amp; againe, hée was very much growne in bignesse of his body &amp; person.</p>
               <p>But when she was fully certified that to be most true which was told hir, without tarrying for the Emperour she ran vnto him, &amp; did imbrace him with great loue &amp; ioy, and toke him out of the armes of the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> who was in his shirt, &amp; embraced with him. But the great ioy, which the Empresse receiued, to haue him in hir armes, was such, that she had no power to speake in a great space. But in the end, with shedding of great abundance of teares, she did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him, for being so long away from hir. In this time, the Emperour came &amp; did imbrace the knight of the Sun, with so great pleasure, that scarcely he could kéepe himselfe vpright.

what to say, but to receiue it for so great a merit, that it sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnto me that I doe lack force and strength for to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it, In this time the pleasant &amp; amorous words which passed betwixt the faire Empresse <hi>Briana</hi> &amp; hir son <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> was with so great ioy &amp; pleasure, &amp; they receiued so great contentment, that I know not wherto to compare it, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that ioy which the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> &amp; the Empresse <hi>Briana</hi> receiued, when they met together in the monestarie of the Riuer, after long time that the Emperour was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. So with this soueraigne ioy the Empresse did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the knight of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> till such time as <hi>Rosicleer</hi> said: May it please your highnesse to speake vnto my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> &amp; to acknowledge him for the best son that euer was borne of mother. Then the Empresse all astonyed &amp; amazed, as one awaked out of hir sléepe vpon a sodaine, she left <hi>Rosicleer</hi> &amp; went vnto the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> who was still in his shirt, &amp; at the opening of his shirt bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, she did sée the signe of the <hi>Sunne</hi> that was on his brest, wherat she receiued so great ioy &amp; pleasure, that if the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour had not ben who did sustaine hir, she had fallen down vnto the ground. Then the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> did knéele down before hir, &amp; toke hir hands &amp; kissed them very often, till such time as she being rauished with ioy, threw hir armes about his neck, &amp; fell downe vpon him, and kissing him on that faire face, with a terrible sigh of great loue she said.</p>
               <p>Oh <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> the loyall and perfect friend of my Lord the emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> how shall I now reioyce my selfe in this great benefit which my Lord God hath shewed vnto mée, to haue the knowledge of so worthie a sonne, if the feare which I haue of Fortune doe not disturbe me, in remembring the solitary life which I lead, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loycing my selfe in your childhood and with what sodayne chaunge Fortune did carrye you away from me. Likewise the great sorrow and griefe which I receiued for your loue was such, that as yet I am not perfect in my selfe, neither
<pb facs="tcp:13970:130"/>
can I beléeue that in one who was inuironed with so great sorrow &amp; bitter anguish, should receiue so great mirth and ioy, so that in the remembrance of all troubles past, if it should not be reioyced with this present ioy, to mitigate the fury therof, my feminine force &amp; strength were not iufficient to suffer the fury of this great pleasure the which is come vnto me, in acknowledging such a valiant &amp; worthy <hi>knight</hi> to be my sonne: Oh how now doe I giue great thanks vnto my God, for the trauailes &amp; troubles, which your losse &amp; the absence of my Lord the Emperour hath caused vnto me, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I am now paied with so high a gift, &amp; ioyfull reward. Saying these &amp; many other words, the Empresse <hi>Briana</hi> had the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> so fast imbraced in hir armes, with hir face ioyning vnto his, that hee had no power to make any answere. And for that these two bretheren were still in their shirts, the pages which were nigh them in the quadran, had belonging vnto them two mantels, wherwith they did couer themselues, &amp; the <hi>Knight</hi> of <hi>Cupid</hi> with the greatest pleasure that euer he felt in all his life, went &amp; kneeled down before the Emperour &amp; said.</p>
               <p>Let it please your soueraigne highnesse to know mée the <hi>Knight</hi> of <hi>Cupid,</hi> who hath not receiued small trauaile for your absence, &amp; for the losse of my brother the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> in séeking of you both in strange Countries, very far &amp; aparted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these countries, although it was not in so ample maner, as was requisite to the seruice of my Lord the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> for that at that time we had him rather for an enimie then for a Father, but for the accomplishment of that which I was bound vnto my Lady the Empresse. And for to know who was the occasion that my Lady the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse should lead so straight &amp; solitary a life, which she main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the monestarie of the Riuer, which was a thing that touched me very much. But now knowing the occasion &amp; ground therof, I doe not meruaile so much, but onely how she could sustain hir self &amp; liue one moment without his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence

               <p>So vath no lesse ioy and pleasure then vnto the knight of the <hi>Sun,</hi> the Emperour did imbrace him, &amp; made him to arise from the ground &amp; said: Oh my son <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> how it seemeth vnto me that you were not content, neither receiued any pleasure at this deceit or pollicy, as you doe say I vsed with the Empresse your mother, but in consideration of the fruit that I receiued in doing the same, I may compare it vnto your lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The fruit which procéeded therof is sufficient to excuse that errour done, if it had ben of greater importaunce, but what reason haue I to excuse my selfe from the occasion that made me to doe it. Then <hi>Rosicleer</hi> not a little abashed at that which the Emperour had said vnto him, answered: If the ouer-plus o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But when it was know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en vnto all people of the acknowledging of their new prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ther was so great plesure amongst them, that in a short time all the whole Citie was so lightsome, as at noone daies with the great light of Bonefires &amp; Torches that was in euery street therof, with many pastimes &amp; new inuentions of so great mirth, that it séemed that ther were ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all the pastimes and pleasures in the world. The royall Princesse <hi>Claridiana</hi> was not the last that came for to see these new Princes, for that so soone as she heard of the great ioy which was caused by this new and straunge newes, shée arose ont of hir bed, and couered hir selfe with
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:13970:131"/>
a precious and rich robe, lined with Martines furre, which was brought hir by hir Damselles, and hir golden hayre hanging downe, with so great beautie, that shée was estée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med rather for some diuine Goddesse, then any humane creature. She went vnto the place whereas the Emperour and the Empresse with their sonnes, were embracing one another. And for that hir Gentlewomen went béefore hir, with lyght Torches in theyr handes, euerie one dyd giue place vnto hir, and did receiue hir with great honour and curtesie. But with a gratious and smiling countenance ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with great seuerity, shée left them all, and went and did embrace the worthy <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and saide: If that by the force of my armes, worthie &amp; valiant <hi>Prince,</hi> did cause you to receiue any anger and griefe, when I made you to be knowen for the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> with the same armes I wil now make satisfaction of my fault, in embrasing of you, as the son of the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> and of my Lady the Empresse <hi>Briana.</hi> The great pleasure which the worthie <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> receiued of this embracing ought not to bée compared vnto that which was the occasion that hée came vnto the knowledge of his father and brother. But this may well bée saide, that hée could not receiue greater pleasure and contentment, if at that time the whole world and all the riches therin had béen giuen vnto him, for when he felt himselfe touched with those delicate armes &amp; warlike hands, hée thought verily that in al his life hée could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the like glorie, and humbling himselfe very much, with a méeke voice he said: As it was perillous vnto the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> that rigorous encounter, which by your strong arme (worthy princesse) he receiued, yet this soueraigne and great benefit, which as son vnto the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> I haue receiued, I doo acknowledge my selfe to bee fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied and paide of that high recompence, although it was not so small the harme which I receiued by that encounter, that I think to receiue any satisfaction, but will rather put mée in farther perill and daunger.

               <p>The king kneeling downe would haue taken his hands to haue kissed them, but the Emperour did cause him to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise from the ground, and would not consent therevnto.

               <p>So after them came the good Emperour, in the midst bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his sons, all mounted vpon great &amp; mighty horses, so gallant &amp; well proporsioned, that it might well be said, that in all the world ther were not thrée <hi>knights</hi> of so gallant a semblance, as they were. And the contentment was so great which all their louing subiects did receiue, that they did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne with an other to put themselues in places where as best they might recreate themselues in the séeking of them. Likewise, all the windowes of the Citie were full of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels &amp; gentlewomen, not a little wondering at their strange &amp; big proportions, giuing great thankes &amp; praise vnto God, for that in all this time he did preserue, defend &amp; kéepe them. And by reason that the Emperour was in the inchantment of <hi>Lindaraza</hi> in the prime of his yéeres, they all thrée did so much resemble the one the other, that they could scant bée knowen the one from the other, but that his sons were som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what bigger of body then their father was. So after them came the faire Empresse <hi>Briana,</hi> vpon a Moyle, very richly garnished &amp; betrapped. And the king <hi>Sacridoro</hi> did lead him by the bridle, the empresse was so gallant &amp; faire, that in all the whole empire of <hi>Greece</hi> could not be found neither lady or damsell, that being put before hir, but that she had great vantage ouer them, except it were the excellent beautie, tho two faire ladies &amp; princes, who went the one on the one side and the other on the other of the empresse. One of them was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13970:137"/>And they were of as gentle dispositions of their bodies, as they were faire and beautifull in their faces, that like the beames of the <hi>Sun,</hi> they did dimme the sight of all them that behold them. And amongst the people there was not a little contempt &amp; strife which of these two should be most fairest, &amp; of best proporsion, although much more greater was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention that either of them had in their harts, for the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> for they knew not to which of them he would yéeld himselfe prisoner, but the force &amp; strength of the presence of eyther of them was such, that it could not be iudged but to be a continuall contention, without hope of any victory, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ther was some vantage in the perillous sight &amp; sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted grace of the royall princesse, more then in the faire Lady, yet considering the long time and great conuersation that she had with the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> was the occasion that ther was such attension within his hart, that he had not so much vnderstanding for to acknowledge the small vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that was betwixt them, by reason whereof hée was brought into that estate, that the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue ben by any of them ouercome, except the presence of one of them had lacked. So in this order they went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the monestary, with the Gyants of the princesse, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermost of all them, &amp; their Damsels, very strongly armed for their sauegard. So they issued out of the Citie into the field wheras the monestary was, and there the <hi>Knightes</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> as well as the straunge <hi>Knight</hi> did make a great triumph and gallaunt shew with their Horses, and for that they were all lustie and valiaunt <hi>knightes,</hi> and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>When they came vnto the Monestarie, the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> did alight from his Horse with a trise, and for that he knew not which of his Ladies he might be bold first to take downe from their Horse, he left them both, and went

vnto the Empresse his mother, &amp; toke hir in his armes &amp; lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hir from hir Moile, wheron she was riding, &amp; sate hir downe vpon the greene grasse, &amp; the Emperour &amp; <hi>Rosicleer</hi> did alight the Princes. Then they altogether entred into the monestary, whereas they heard diuine seruice with great solempnitie, yet the two sons did not so much reioyce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues therat, as the Emperour their father did, for that the presence of those faire Ladies did cause <hi>Rosicleer</hi> to call vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to remembraunce the great beauty of the Princesse <hi>Oliuia,</hi> who was no lesse in degree then any of them, so that there could no ioy nor pastime enter into his hart, that was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to take away that great heauinesse that so long time was rooted in him, but rather the conuersation of his parents &amp; of the princes &amp; <hi>Knights,</hi> did cause in him the more sorow, for that he could not occupy himselfe in those déepe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found thoughts as he was to doe, and was very desirous to find some meanes, how with reason he might leaue that life which he then lead very much against his will, &amp; séeke some other way which was more agreeble vnto his vnfortunate estate. In this day the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> more by diuine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, then for any duty vnto his parents, did receiue the holy sacrament of baptisme, &amp; did confesse that all those gods in the which he did beléeue, to be false &amp; liers, &amp; did returne vnto the law &amp; faith of Christ, with so great will &amp; deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined mind, as though he had ben a long time before instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therin, for hée had alwaies before his eyes, &amp; could not be fully satisfied that it should be good, that law in the which he had liued hether to, which was the occasion that with the more ease he did attaine to the perfection of the law of god. In which hée continued his life time, like a true &amp; faithfull Christian. At the which the precious Princesse <hi>Lindabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> did receiue so great sorrow and griefe, that she séemed to prognosticate vnto hir selfe, that the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> was not ordained for hir, neyther for to be Lord and raigne ouer the great Empire of the <hi>Seythians.</hi> And to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<pb facs="tcp:13970:138"/>
the princesse <hi>Claridiana</hi> was so glad &amp; ioyfull, for that she was wholy perswaded of hir securitie therby, &amp; also void of the feare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she had of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great beauty of the faire Princesse <hi>Lindabrides,</hi> (although time did serue that shee could haue had a much greater in effect.) So the diuine seruice was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, &amp; euery one of them in such order as they went forth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned backe againe vnto the royall pallace, whereas they dined together, in the one part of the pallace more then two thousand <hi>Knights,</hi> &amp; in the other part in a faire great qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dran, which opened vpon a very fresh &amp; odiferous gréene gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, wheras the Empresse dined, with all hir Ladies, Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, &amp; gentlewomen, &amp; in the meane time while they wer at dinner, ther was so great melody &amp; musicke, with strange in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And there were many <hi>Knightes</hi> at the boorde that did forget to eat, and were as halfe amazed or astonied in beeholding the mighty and strange thinges that were done in that great hall all the dinner time, which séemed vnto them to be the straungest that euer they had séene.</p>

And for that this our long iourney shall not be ended without receiuing some benefit and profit, héere I doo desire you most high &amp; mightie Emperor, to giue leaue and lisence vnto these your <hi>knights,</hi> that in this case they may procure to do their best, otherwise with great reason they might haue shame to come béefore their amorous Dames, if that you too refraine the consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment héereof, and not to defend them in this case with all their might &amp; power, but first I doo giue you to vnderstand, that béefore that this valiant Prince <hi>Rodaran</hi> doo enter into battell with any of these <hi>knights,</hi> it shall bée vpon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that if hée bée by any <hi>knight</hi> ouercome, that both hée &amp; I to be prisoners vnto him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> getteth the victorie, to do with vs all that his will &amp; pleasure shall bée. And if it bée so that hée doth ouercome any <hi>knight,</hi> that likewise in the same or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he to bée his prisoner, to carry him into his Countrie, or to doo his pleasure w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him. And againe, although the Prince <hi>Rodaran</hi> as one that is without all feare, would in the midst of the place of this great Citie make the proofe of his great
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:13970:141"/>
bounty, for that it should be the more manifest vnto you all: yet I béeing no man, and somewhat timerous, for the great loue which I doo beare vnto him, haue requested him that it might not bée héere in this citie, for that the imprisonment of so high <hi>Princes &amp; knights</hi> as be héere present, might grow vnto great perill &amp; danger, and great disturbance to vse his will of his prisoners, after they bée ouercome. And for that the security of all parts shall be more certaine to auoid the inconueniences that may happen to the contrarie, it shall be good, and seemeth vnto me very conuenient, that these trials do passe at the bridge of the white <hi>Iasper</hi> ston, that which is on the first arme of the fiue Riuers, which runneth into the Riuer of <hi>Danubia,</hi> and runneth into the Sea <hi>Maditaraneo,</hi> which is in the confines &amp; vtter parts of this mightie Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, wheras the Prince <hi>Rodaran</hi> shall tarrie and abide the comming of all such <hi>knights</hi> as will combat in the defence of this demand, and neuer to depart the field till such time as hée bée ouercome, or else to remaine with the victorie of all <hi>Knights,</hi> of what estate and same so euer they bée. And for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince <hi>Rodaran</hi> shall performe &amp; kéepe all that is said, according vnto the order of knighthood, hée shall giue his gage afore all and vnto all that is in this great hall.</p>
               <p>And therewith the Prince <hi>Rodaran</hi> did throw his gantlet so high, that all those which were there might sée it, in token of defiaunce. And without saying any more, or dooing any reuerence, they departed out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great hal, leauing amongst all them that were therein a great laughter, as well at the demaund of the Gentlewoman, as at the disposition of the Dwarfes, although they receiued great contentment at the disposition of the <hi>knight,</hi> and ther were many that were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry desirous to make the first proofe with him, and béeléeued of a certaintie, that according as hée was of members and stature, that hée should bée of great force and strength.</p>
               <p>With this desire there were diuerse that arose vp from the
<pb facs="tcp:13970:142"/>
table, and went vnto the <hi>Emperour,</hi> &amp; asked lisence that they might go &amp; prooue themselues with that <hi>knight,</hi> amongst the which, the first was that good <hi>Knight Rodamarte,</hi> Prince of the <hi>Rhodes,</hi> a yong <hi>Knight,</hi> &amp; one of the valiantest that was in the <hi>Emperours</hi> Court. Likewise the valiant Prince <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dafeo,</hi> who was also a very good <hi>Knight,</hi> and both of them in loue with faire ladies that were with the Empresse, the one of them was daughter vnto the king of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milinia,</hi> &amp; the other was daughter vnto the king of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> called <hi>Salandria,</hi> who receiuing great contentment of theyr valiant desires &amp; good dispositions, did shew vnto them great fauour &amp; curtesie determining to take them to bée their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands. Likewise in this demaund ther lacked not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> valiant <hi>Brandizel,</hi> who sustained great passions with the griefe that hée receiued for the absence of the fayre Princesse <hi>Clarinea,</hi> would in hir absence doo hir this seruice, for that the beauty of that Gentlewoman was nothing in comparison vnto his Lady. And with no lesse good will y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good king <hi>Sacridoro</hi> came foorth to aske lisence, &amp; after him <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> &amp; the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> all being on foot before the Emperour, did desire him to giue them lisence to giue the first attempt: who with a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant laughter said that he knew not what to say in that case, but did remit it vnto the Princesse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> that she shuld determine what they should doo therin. Who did excuse hir selfe in all that euer shée could, &amp; did remit it vnto the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse <hi>Lindabrides,</hi> yet for all that it fell out that in the ende shee must néeds determine and conclude the great contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that was amongst all those <hi>Knights,</hi> who should bée the first that should giue the attempt. So shée concluded that the first enterprise should hée giuen by him that dyd first aske lisence of the Emperour, and next vnto him the second that demaunded lisence, and so the third, in the same or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as they craued lisence. And although it was a griefe vnto them which should bée the last, hauing for certayntie that the first would conclude the demaund of <hi>Rodaran,</hi> yet
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:13970:142"/>
for all that they thought the sentence iust and right which was giuen by the royall Princesse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> who if at that time had béene lawfull, with a very good will she wold haue béene the first hir selfe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> should haue defended hir owne beautie, rather then to haue made the order and repetition shée did vnto the <hi>knights.</hi> The Prince <hi>Rodamarte</hi> would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently haue departed in the demand, but the Emperour by no meanes would consent ther vnto, but said that in all that day they shuld not meddle therin, neither should any <hi>knight</hi> arme himselfe, neither doo any other thing but spend y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time in pastime &amp; plesure, &amp; celebrate that feast for the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of his sons, &amp; how that they had time inough after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to accomplish their desires. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they spent the time in no other thing, but in making of mirth and pastime, with meruailous straunge &amp; new inuentions, holden in the place of that great Citie by the Citizens, that gaue great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment vnto all the <hi>Knights,</hi> who likewise did dance with the Ladies and Damsells of the Empresse, who were verie faire and pleasant. Likewise the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> did dance with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princesse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> &amp; with the princesse <hi>Lindabrides,</hi> with so gentle &amp; curteous demeanour, that they receiued so great contentment therein, as to sée him in his armour, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though according vnto his déepe thoughts, he had more care to rule his eies to béeholde them in equall manner, then hée had to kéepe his féete in compasse in his dauncing. So the night drew on, &amp; all those which dined with the Emperour did likewise sup with him, and after supper they passed away the most part of the night in dauncing and mirth.

of the Princes and <hi>knights, til</hi> such time as shée was within the <hi>Chariot,</hi> whereas they did all take their leaue of hir, and returned backe, vnto the pallace, which was a great griefe vnto the <hi>Knight of the Sun,</hi> for that hée could not carry and remaine to sléepe in the <hi>Charior</hi> as he was wont to doo, and no lesse was the griefe of the princesse <hi>Lindabrides</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she saw him depart, and although the acknowledging of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> did cause hir very much to reioyce for that hée was of so high estate, yet she would for hir part haue giuen the halfe of hir lands, vpon the condition that she had neuer knowen him what he was, for that she was better in quiet when shée vnderstood no other thing but onely his great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l our &amp; bounty, and the name of the <hi>Knight of the Sun,</hi> &amp; the great securitie that shée had to marry with him, then now to know him to bée of so high blood and linage, wich the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill that shée doth suspect, and a thing apparaunt béefore hir eies, which was the occasion that in all that night shée could not take any rest nor sléepe, with the great care and griefe which shée receiued, and hir minde so tumbled &amp; tossed with diuerse such strange thoughts concerning the <hi>Knight of the Sunne,</hi> that neuer in all hir life she found hir selfe in the like confusion. For one way considering with what intent shée departed out of hir owne Countrie, and how that hir bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Prince <hi>Meridian</hi> was gone and left hir, &amp; another way, the acknowledging of the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and the renouncing of his law, and likewise the comming of the Princesse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> with hir estate, and surmounting beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, did cause hir to suspect very much that the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> would wholy giue ouer the enterprise that hée had taken in hand, so that she did account hir selfe to bée the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiest and most vnfortunatest Damsell that was borne into the world, and with the great griefe that this doubtful thought did cause in hir, shée saide.</p>

a prisoner; What comfort shall I take séeing that I am whithout all remedy? What counsaile shall I take hauing no vnderstanding, neither is there any power to perswade mée to reason, but will rather the more increase my sorrow and griefe? What shall I doo, if I doo remaine héere, I shall lack reson to sustaine my selfe, &amp; considering my high estate, will cause a farther griefe: &amp; againe, the sight of the <hi>knight of the Sunne</hi> cannot bee so ioyfull vnto mée, as the presence of <hi>Claridiana</hi> will bée hurtfull. And if I depart out of this Countrie, and returned vnto mine owne, it will be no other thing but to separate the life and soule from the body. And to liue without the presence of the <hi>Knight of the Sunne,</hi> will bée a life vnto mée, as vnto those who are in the darke, and see no light. But alasse what do I say, although they receiue nor sée no light, yet the paine doth not trouble them: but it I do finde my selfe banished out of the presence of the <hi>knight of the Sunne,</hi> there can bée no paine in the world compared vnto that which I shall suffer. Oh <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> how mightie and straunge is your Fortune, that onely in your ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds doth remaine the whole remedie of the Princesse <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabrides,</hi> shee who in beautie and fairenesse is excellent and doth excéede, and amongst all Ladies is the most highest, and yet will let to giue hir remedie, but rather condempne hir vnto cruell death. Wherefore haue I so many Lordshippes and kingdoms, with so many thousaads of people, which the diuine Gods hath giuen vnto mee, when that with all those ioyntly with my straunge &amp; exquisite beautie, I cannot sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect the will of one alone <hi>Knight.</hi>

But being both present, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great liking he had of the royall Princes, did almost ouer come him: who at that time neither more nor lesse, did take as little ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se, as the others did sléepe. For that the great loue which she had vnto the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> did not let but put some doubt in that which hir wounded hart so much desired. And although the highnesse of hir estate &amp; the excellency of hir beauty, did almost wholy perswade hir of securitie, that the knight of the <hi>Sun</hi> would not forget hir. Yet the sight of the princes <hi>Lindabrides,</hi> and hir remaining in the court did cause in hir some Ielosie, not knowing what would bee the end of that hir demaund. Likewise she had great doubt in hir hope: For that at such time as the princesse should returne into hir owne country, the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> could not doe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So it happened on a time as this mightie Emperour <hi>Alicandro</hi> was in his

               <p>So before that any did arise vp to demaund of him the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, ther arose vp amongst them a king, who was king of <hi>Gedrosia,</hi> an old man of more then one hundreth yeares, who amongst all the rest present, was estéemed to be the wisest in Astrologie, &amp; deuination, that could be found in all <hi>Asia.</hi> And all they did giue so great credit vnto that which he did tell them should happen, as though it had ben all ready ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished: the which king dyd wéepe very bitterly, &amp; with so great sorrow, that almost he could not speake, but yet he said. <q>Oh high &amp; mighty king of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> &amp; Emperour of the <hi>Tartarians,</hi> if you had as good iudgement of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things to come héere after, as now to conceiue in matters present, then wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Without saying any more this old king of <hi>Gedrosia,</hi> did set himselfe downe againe in his place, leauing this mighty em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour &amp; all the other kings and <hi>Knights</hi> that were in that great hall, very much amazed at the words which hee had spoken, &amp; knew not what to say, but being amazed they did looke one vpon another, &amp; spake neuer a word.

               <p>Without speaking any more wordes this olde king of <hi>Gedrosia</hi> set himselfe agayne in his place, leauing this mightye Emperour and all those Kings and Nobles that were ther present, much more amazed then they were at the first, although they were fully perswaded and béeléeued of a certainty, that it was impossible to finde in all the world so many <hi>Knightes</hi> that might compare themselues with them that were at that present in that court, no not by a great deale, whith was the occasion that wheras bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they did not giue full credit vnto those wordes which the King <hi>Gedrosia</hi> had sayde. At this time they gaue lesse and made a mocke at him and at his diuinations, but yet for that the Emperour <hi>Alicandro</hi> was verye wise, and hadde great experience of the small security that was in the prosperous estates of this transitorye worlde,
<pb facs="tcp:13970:148"/>
with a wan colour &amp; sorrowfull semblance, he fell in a great imagination &amp; déepe thought, musing vpon the words which the King <hi>Gedrosia</hi> had said. And as the Emperour was in this sort a great while without speaking any word, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pensiue &amp; heauie, amongst the rest of all those kings &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that were in that great hall, the valiant <hi>Rodaran</hi> arose vp &amp; put himself on foot, who was king of <hi>Arabia,</hi> subiect vnto the Emperour <hi>Alicandro,</hi> a young man, &amp; so valiant, that in all <hi>Asia</hi> there was not a <hi>knight</hi> to be found, that by a great deale was able to compare himself with him in mighty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wesse &amp; feates of armes, and for that he was so furious and stubburne, he was feared of all, &amp; all that were in the whole Empire of <hi>Tartaria,</hi> were very desirous to pleasure him, and not one that durst anger him in any respect, except it were that valiant Prince <hi>Meridian,</hi> with whom he would neuer contend nor procure to combat, yet ther was neuer other <hi>knight</hi> nor Giant that euer did abide the battaile with him one houre. This <hi>Rodaran</hi> with great courage and anger, as though fire should procéed out of his eies, béegan and said as followeth.</p>
               <p>I doe not know high &amp; mighty emperour of <hi>Tartaria,</hi> with what reason is attributed vnto thee the name of the diuine, &amp; the parentage that you haue of the high &amp; diuine Gods, that you doe suffer in your presence, &amp; in the presence of so many mightie kings &amp; lords your subiects, that the king of <hi>Gedro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi> should be so bold &amp; hardy to speake these blasphemies, the which he hath said, for that I do beléeue, that if all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the gods, &amp; the rest of all the whole world besides, shuld ioyne themselues together by the Deity that you haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by your predecessors, if they were all ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet were they not sufficient to comprehend this, the which the king hath saide, much lesse the Emperour of <hi>Greece,</hi> and the knights that shall there be assembled and ioyned together. And héere I doe sweare vnto you by the order of <hi>Knighthood</hi> that I haue receiued, and by my king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

estate, that if I had the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all together in the fielde against mée, I doo thinke to kill and destroy them all, or make them to yeeld as prisoners. And againe, if it be so that the diuina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this olde King of <hi>Gedrosia</hi> doo put any feare or dreade into your harts, and that his words should séeme vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you to bée true, and that the remedy the which hée hath ordained will bée sufficient for to auoide the great inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, in making away those <hi>knights.</hi> Heere beefore your diuine highnesse, and béefore all that bée héere present I doo promise, that at such time as these <hi>knights</hi> shal assemble and ioyne together in the Citie of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to bée there present in that Court, and will maintaine and defend that the Quéene <hi>Carmania,</hi> my well béeloued Lady and mistris, is the most fayrest Lady in all the world. And with all those that shall say vnto the contrarie, vppon the same reason I wil combat with him, vntill such time as one of vs bée dead or yéelded prisoner vnto the other, vpon condition that hée who hath the victorie, shall vse his pleasure with him that is ouercome. So that in this sort either they shall remaine the most weakest and cowardliest <hi>knights</hi> in the world, or else I will bring them prisoners béefore your presence, for that the king of <hi>Gedrosia</hi> may loose the great feare which he hath conceiued of them.</p>
               <p>When hée had made an ende of speaking, there was not one King nor <hi>Knight</hi> amongest all them in the great hall that durst make any answere vnto those proude words of <hi>Rodaran,</hi> but onely the king of <hi>Gedrosia,</hi> who rising vpon his féete did answere him, saying.</p>
               <p>If thou wert so valiaunt of armes and déedes <hi>Rodaran,</hi> as proude in thy words, then should I bée fully certified, that thou wouldest bée sufficient to accomplish much more then héere thou hast said, and that there were not in all the world a <hi>Knight</hi> that might compare himselfe with thée, but for that thy strength and prowesse is far different and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie vnto thy great pride, héere I doo giue thée to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande that this day twelue moneths there shall bée such <hi>Knights</hi> assembled and ioyned together in <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13970:149"/>
that whereas thou shalt excéede them in the one, they shall excéede thée in the other. And it shall happen vnto thée many houres in the daye that thou shalt acknowledge this to bée true, all this which I haue sayde vnto thée, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at this present it séemeth vnto thée to be a fable and lye. And I doo desire no other reuengement for the iniury which I haue receiued at thy hands, but onely the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension which thou thy selfe shalt make at such time as it shall bée vnto thée well knowen. And for that my words shall séeme vnto thée to be of lesse credit, and that thou shalt haue farther experience of that which I by the starres and celestiall opperations doo vnderstand and know, héere I doo giue thée to vnderstand (that if thou doost goe forwards with this enterprise which thou hast promised) thou shalt finde in the Citie of <hi>Constantinople</hi> a woman, who with hir singular beuty &amp; fairnes shal far excel the beuty of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quéene of <hi>Carmania,</hi> thy lady, &amp; with the great force &amp; strength of hir arme, shall abate thy courage and make thée to yéeld.</p>
               <p>And therewith hée held his peace, but the great pride of that valiant <hi>Rodaran</hi> encreased, in such sort, when hée heard those words of the olde King <hi>Gedrosia,</hi> and his anger was so great, that if the Emperour and those kings which were there present had not disturbed him, with determined pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose hée went towards him to haue throwen him out at the window. But when hée saw that hée could not execute his pretence, with great anger and courage he went out of the hall, swearing great oathes, that hée would accomplish and performe all that which hee had promised, &amp; that béeing finished, to take reuengement of the great iniurie which hée had receiued of the olde king <hi>Gedrosia.</hi> Wherewith hée left all that were ther present greatly amazed at his pride and hardinesse. And so departed vnto the kingdome of <hi>Carmania,</hi> whereas all his ioy was, for that hée was amorous of the Quéene of <hi>Carmania,</hi> who was in great royaltie and estate, and very faire. And in processe of time finding himselfe in great fauour with hir, and hauing hir aide and help to his

contentment, hée straight way gaue hir to vnderstand of all that which had passed with him in the court of the mightie Emperour of <hi>Tartaria,</hi> and of his promise that hée had made béefore all those which were there present, in saying that he could not in any maner of wise excuse the same, but that hée must néedes béegin the enterprise of his iourney towardes <hi>Greece</hi> out of hand. The Quéene <hi>Carmania</hi> was very wise and of a good iudgement and vnderstanding, &amp; if it had béene in hir power, shée would very faine haue hindred this iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and for that shée knew very well the condition of this valiaunt and stout <hi>Rodaran,</hi> and that there were none that were able to perswade him from the contrarye of this his determined purpose, shée wold not by any means say ought against him, but with a merrie countenaunce shée dyd of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer hir selfe to goe with him into <hi>Greece,</hi> vpon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition that hée would grant vnto hir one thing that she would demand of him, if his pleasure were that shée should goe with him. The which with a very good will hee did graunt vnto hir. And shée promised him to beare him companie. Then dyd they ordaine all things necessary, for to carry with him on his iourney, but halfe the yéere was almost past before they could begin to trauaile, for that the quéene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded a net of yron to be made, very arteficially &amp; cunningly wrought, &amp; it could not bée made an ende of in any shorter time.</p>
               <p>And although that <hi>Rodaran</hi> did often times aske where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the same was made, yet for all that the Quéene would neuer tell him, but after that this net was made, and all things in a redinesse, this valiant <hi>Rodaran</hi> &amp; the Quéene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of the Countrie of <hi>Carmania,</hi> &amp; carried in theyr company certaine <hi>knights</hi> and <hi>Pages</hi> which were necessary, and after that they had passed many and diuerse countries, they came vnto the port of <hi>Tenedon,</hi> whereas they did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barke themselues, and tooke their way towards <hi>Greece.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13970:150"/>And although there happened vnto this mightie Prince in his iourney many strange and wonderfull things, béecause it is not necessarie, this Historie doth not make any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, but onely in the ende of many daies and great trauaile, they ariued in <hi>Greece,</hi> not far from <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi> This valiaunt <hi>Rodaran</hi> was determined to execute his enterprise within the Citie of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but the Quéene of <hi>Carmania</hi> did disturbe him, and sayde, that now was the time come that hée should performe the gift that hée had promised hir béefore hée did depart out of <hi>Carmania,</hi> which was, that the contension which should passe with him and the <hi>Knights of Greece,</hi> should not bée executed in the Citie of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but in the place whereas shée would appoynt it. The which <hi>Rodaran,</hi> although it did grieue him very much, yet durst hée not say against it bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hée promised hir. So they nauigated all along the shoare, till they came vnto the Bridge called Iasp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

When this valiant <hi>Rodaran</hi> and the Quéene ariued at that bridge, &amp; saw it to bée a place very conuenient for their purpose, straight way the prince <hi>Rodaran</hi> did prepare himselfe for to win the same, &amp; béeing armed &amp; in very good order, hee tooke the quéene by the hand, and without any more company they went towards y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gate of the bridge, &amp; knocked therat, &amp; for that they were all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, the gate was straight way opened. When they were entered within the first Tower, this valiant <hi>Rodaran</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded those that were the keepers therof, that they should yéeld vp the towers and bridge, and that they should depart with quietnesse. Who séeing him alone &amp; they so many, wold not obey his commandement, but did procure to defend the towers &amp; the bridge, and wold not suffer him to perswadge any farther.

So af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the Quéene of <hi>Carmania</hi> had well perused the scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the bridges, &amp; of the towers, she saw that the tower that was in the midst of the Bridge was made in such sort, that beneath it was round like vnto an arke and hollow, without any gate, but as broad as the bridge was, wheras shée caused the net of yron to bée hanged in the highest part of the hollownesse within, in such sort, that it could not bée séene nor descerned without, but it was so large, that it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied all the bignesse of the vaut within, and in such sort the Quéene of <hi>Carmania</hi> caused it to be hanged, that in pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lling of a cord, ordained for that purpose, the whole n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But for so much as she is present, I know not how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse my selfe, but first consent to loose my life. then to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any such offence. Therfore as reason doth require, séeing that you do know who I am, let me likewise know by whom I shall be ouercome.

And therewith all these two valiant knights did depart the one from the other, <hi>Rodamarte</hi> toward the foote of the bridge whereas he entred in, &amp; <hi>Rodaran</hi> toward the place whereas the quéene was.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:13970:155"/>
And was very sorrowfull because that this victory did not passe in the great citie of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> thinking that ther, better then in any other place, he might reioyce himselfe of his great pride &amp; vain glory, &amp; did very much reprehend the queene for that ther was so much time lost in <hi>Carmania,</hi> in making that yron net for that they had no néede therof. The Quéene séeing that he had great reason so to say, helde hir peace, &amp; answered nothing ther vnto. When the prince <hi>Roda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feo</hi> was ouercome &amp; prisoner, his squier returned backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vnto <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and watching the time that the Emperour &amp; all his <hi>Knights</hi> were together, he entered into the court, &amp; declared all that which happened vnto the prince, at the which they were greatly amazed, &amp; from that day for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they had the valiant <hi>Rodaran</hi> in much more estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, séeing that he had ouercome two of the best <hi>knights</hi> that the Emperour had, &amp; although at that present the emperour receiued for them great sorow &amp; griefe, suspecting that these two princes should be ill intreated in the power of <hi>Roda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> yet because he was fully certified that ther remained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde such <hi>knights</hi> for to combat with him, that very shortly would not ouely set them at liberty, but also bring <hi>Rodaran</hi> prisoner vnto him. So for that the third lot did fall vnto the mighty &amp; valiant prince <hi>Brandizel,</hi> to take this enterprise &amp; demaund, straight way as soone as the squier of <hi>Rodafeo</hi> had told the newes of his Lords imprisonment, he arose vp from the place wheras he was set nigh vnto the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> and put himselfe before the Emperour, &amp; asked lisence for to goe and combat with <hi>Rodaran,</hi> who did graunt it vnto him, and said.</p>
               <p>I am very sorrowfull (mightye and valiaunt Prince) that you were not the first that went in this demaund, for if you had, I doe beléeue of a certaintie, that <hi>Rodaran</hi> should not haue had any occasion to boast himselfe of the victorye of any <hi>knights</hi> of my Court. And therewith the Prince doing his duety vnto the Emperour, departed out of the

                  <hi>Sun</hi> did declare vnto the emperour all that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned betwéene them two, &amp; what he had seene him doe against his knights at the sea. Likewise some part of his valiantnes the Prince <hi>Claueryndo</hi> had told him of, and done in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence &amp; company. At the which all those that were ther pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent meruayled very much.

At which time the Squyer of the Prince <hi>Brandizel,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned

without the gates, dyd not let to pray vnto his Gods for the victorie of his Lord, after that hée heard the noise of that terrible encounter, which made him verie much to meruaile, but much more did <hi>Rodaran</hi> meruayle, at a thing which séemed vnto him very straunge, to sée him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe ouerthrowen to the ground by the encounter of one alone <hi>knight,</hi> whereas béefore hée thought that there was not one <hi>Knight</hi> in all the world that was able to doo it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Likewise hée was greatly ashamed to see himselfe vnhorsed béefore the presence of his Lady &amp; Quéene, which caused to increase in him great anger and furie, for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge himselfe of that iniurie, and drew out his Swoord the which was very great and broade, and went agaynst the Prince, who was not a little amazed to sée him come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him with so great furie and force, and séeing his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, did likewise draw out his Swoord and met him, and both of them stroke together with so great furie and force, that at the first blowes theyr shéelds were cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder, and theyr swoords descended vpon theyr Healmes with so great strength, that it made both of them to decline theyr heads downe vnto theyr breasts, and made each other of them féele and acknowledge the force and strength of his aduersarie, and from that time these two warriors dyd strike such mightie and furious blowes the one vpon the other, with so great strength, that it was wonderfull to béeholde, alwaies procuring where to strike his aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, for to doo him most harme, and although theyr armour were of so straunge and excellent mixture, that there was neuer force nor strength of man, neyther any Swoord so fine, that could cut or perish them, which was the occasion that it did saue them from wounding one another, yet for all that, they dyd strike their blowes so thicke, and in such great hast, that at such time as they dyd fasten a right and sure blow, they did greatlie bruse one anothers flesh and bones, so that either of them dyd procure the best hée could to defend himselfe from the terrible blowes of his enimie.</p>
               <p>At this time was passed a good houre, from the time that
<pb facs="tcp:13970:158"/>
they first béegan their battaile, at which time <hi>Rodaran</hi> sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that although hée dyd his best in executing his furie, that there was no vauntage to bée séene of neither of theyr parts, hée was verie much amazed at the great force and strength of his aduersarie, and béegan somwhat to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the great reason that the olde King of <hi>Gedrosia</hi> had, in praysing and extolling the high and mightie déedes of the <hi>Knights of Greece:</hi> moreouer, hée sayde vnto himselfe, that that <hi>knight</hi> alone was sufficient for to destroy halfe the armie of the Emperour <hi>Alycandro,</hi> and by reason that his pride was very great, and hée himselfe of a valyaunt and stout courage, although the victorie should bée very late, yet hee supposed that the fury of the Prince <hi>Brandizel</hi> could not endure long against him, and béeing fullie perswaded in his thought, he made so great hast in striking of the Prince, that hée made him very much to meruaile at his stout and valyant courage, béecause it troubled him very much, and brought him into that perplexitie, that hée was driuen to béesturre himselfe from the one side of the Bridge vnto the other, for to cleere himselfe from some of his great blowes, which to the contrarie hée should haue receiued, and made him to vse more lightnesse then the bigge proportion of his body could well indure, and for that their sheelds were all cut and broken in péeces, in such sort that there was no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in them, the whole state of the battaile was in the great and mightie force in striking on another, executting their blowes with theyr swoords in both theyr hands, in such furious sort, that the one had great feare of the other, their bones and flesh were all brused with the mightie force of their blowes, and their bodies so wearied, that if it were not for the great valour of theyr hearts and courage, and againe the losse of victorie so shamefull and reprobrious, ther was neither of them, but with a very good will would haue throwen himselfe along vppon the ground to haue taken some rest, but by reason that they were so valyaunt <hi>Knights,</hi> and very few in all the whole world that were
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:13970:158"/>
able to haue any vauntage of them, would not shew one a nother the great necessitie in the which they wer brought, <hi>Rodaran</hi> for that hée was in the presence of the quéene, who was very sad and heauie in hir semblance, and no lesse mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed to sée the cruell battayle that was béetwéene them. Likewise the Prince <hi>Brandizel,</hi> with the remembraunce of the faire princesse <hi>Clarinea,</hi> and of the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> and all the rest of the knights of his court, he thought it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to die ther a thousand deaths, then to returne back vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the court, and loose the victory, at which thoughts they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered so great courage, &amp; gathered so great strength from theyr valiant harts, that eyther of them looked as well for death as victorie. At which time there had passed more then thrée houres from the béeginning of their battell all which time they neuer rested themselues, nor ceased not to oppresse the one the other all that in them was possible. Which was the occasion that the mightie and couragious stomacke of that valiaunt <hi>Rodaran</hi> was not sufficient, neyther the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the quéene of <hi>Carmania,</hi> but that his great pride did abate (which béefore was neuer brought in subiection) and of pure necessitie and force, by reason of his great weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, withdrew himselfe on the one side, and with the great griefe thereof hée béegan to speake vnto the prince and said. <hi>Knight</hi> hold thy hands, and let vs rest our selues a while, for that there doth continue time inough to finish our battell.</p>
               <p>Likewise the Prince <hi>Brandizel</hi> at that time was brought into so great necessitie of rest, that without answering him any word, hée did likewise withdraw himselfe, &amp; leaned vpon the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:13970:159"/>
force of <hi>Rodaran</hi> did long endure, it could not bée otherwise but that he should bée ouercome and loose the victory, and yet considering what a great shamd and rebuke it would bée vnto him to come béefore the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> and the rest of his great friends, the <hi>Knight of the Sunne</hi> and the Prince <hi>Clauerindo,</hi> hée did fully determine with himselfe to loose his life fiting on foote, and not to bée ouerthrowen from his Horse to the ground, and to loose the victorie. At this present time likewise <hi>Rodaran</hi> was leaning vppon his swoord to breath himselfe, and called vnto his remembrance the words that the olde king of <hi>Gedrosia</hi> had sayde vnto him, and séemed that they would proue to bee true, and did verie much commend his great wisdome and knowledge, and dyd reprehend his owne gpeat pride, and would with a very good will haue giuen the greatest part of his estate, vpon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition that he had not put himselfe in this demaund, and contention, béecause hée found himselfe to bée so wearie, and that in so long time they had battaile and combat toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there was no vantage to bée iudged on either part, hée thought of a certaintie that it could not bée otherwise, ibut hée must bée ouercome and loose the victory. And as hée was béeholding of the Prince, and very much meruailing at his great force and bountie, it séemed vnto him that according vnto the mightinesse of his person and the richnesse of his armour, that hée should bée some <hi>Knight</hi> of high estate. So after a while that hée had well breathed and refreshed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hée saide.</p>
               <p>Wherefore haue not wée great care ouer our selues, and wish that wée had not knowen one another, for that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto that which hath passed béetwixt vs in this first battell, and againe, that which wée doo looke for in the second battell, cannot bée, but that eyther of vs will sooner consent to die, then to bée ouer come and loose the victory.

Thou doost demaund of mée great account, sayd the Prince, but for that thou shalt not béeléeue all that which thou hast saide, I will bee briefe &amp; giue thée to vnderstand in few words. I doo bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue that thou doost know, or at the least wayes hast heard, of the great battailes and contentions that passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt my Father the King <hi>Florion,</hi> and the mightie <hi>Africa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> who had vsurped and taken away my Fathers king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.

And moreouer hée said, that in the Empire of <hi>Greece</hi> there were such <hi>Knights,</hi> that if meanes were not found by one way
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:13970:160"/>
or other to disturbe them, that they alone were sufficient to accomplish and bring to passe all this which I haue sayd. And for this occasion I departed out of my Kingdome and Countrie, and dyd promise the Emperour <hi>Alycandro</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to retourne againe vnto the same, till such time as I came vnto the Empire of <hi>Greece,</hi> and there with my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and force to take prisoners the best <hi>Knights</hi> that bée in all the Empire, and to carrie them away with mée vnto the Emperour <hi>Alycandro,</hi> &amp; now séeing that you doo know my determination and purpose, and the great profit that will grow thereof vnto all <hi>Asia,</hi> I doo desire thee by the seruice and dutie which thou dost owe vnto the high Gods, that leauing the great friendship which thou hast with the Christians, let vs two procure to take and carrie them pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners into our Countrie, that by them wée may raunsome and set our selues at libertie from the great destruction which is prognosticated to bée done vnto vs by them, which by no meanes can bée excused, except first wée doo this which I haue tolde thée. Then the Prince <hi>Brandizel</hi> answered and saide. Let the Pagans remaine in their Countrie, and let the Christians alone in theyrs, for that this remedie which thou hast taken in hand <hi>Rodaran,</hi> will verie little profit to excuse the harme which thou hast spoken of, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing determined by the high powers. And héere I dooe giue thée to vnderstand that there doth remaine many <hi>Knights</hi> in the Citie of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and such, as ten such <hi>knights</hi> as thou art be not sufficient to take one of them, and to bring him vnto prison.

               <p>Héere <hi>Rodaran</hi> was very sorrowfull, béecause hée found so small comfort of the Prince in this his determination, and beléeuing that onely in the ouercomming of that knight dyd consist the accomplishing of his aduenture, and that it might so fall out, by the victorie of him to end his demaund, for that which the Prince had tould hée could not béeleeue, neyther giue credite that those <hi>knights</hi> which dyd remayne béehinde in the court, should bée such as hée dyd report them to bée, but with the great anger which his words did cause in him, with a couragious stomacke hée tooke his swoord in both his hands, and went against the Prince, and stroke him such a right downe blow vppon his fine and precyou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Lykewise the blow which hée recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vppon the wall dyd grieue him very much, that if it had not béene by the great fury that hée receiued, which dyd
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:13970:161"/>
sustaine him, he could not haue kept him vpright on his féet, but his anger &amp; fury was such, that as one that had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued any hurt nor harme, with great lightnesse returned vpon the prince, &amp; began to strike at him such terrible &amp; thick blowes, as though the battaile wer but then new begun. At the which the prince was very much amazed, &amp; did force him selfe all that euer he could, to strike at <hi>Rodaran,</hi> the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest blowes that it was possible for him to giue, in such sort that the battaile was at that time in the greatest fury that euer it was. And the noise of their terrible &amp; thicke blowes vpon their fine helmes, was so great, that the towers &amp; gates of the bridge did séeme to tremble. Then the squier of the prince who was without, was very much amazed that the battayle did so long endure, fearing that <hi>Rodaran</hi> dyd not make the battaile with the prince alone, for that it did so long indure, which caused him to goe from one place vnto an other, procuring wher he might be to sée what passed betwixt them, to certifie the truth therof. And as he went alongst the waters side, he went so far that he might discouer the space of the bridge that was betwixt the two towers, &amp; although the walls or battilments of the bridge were somwhat high, yet for that the <hi>knights</hi> were both very bigge of theyr per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that hée might from their brestes vpwardes discerne them, so that part of their battaile hée might perceiue. And when this squier did sée that they were alone, and the great heate and fury of their battaile, which seemed at that time to be but new begun, hée was greatly aston<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ed and as one halfe amazed, and could not perswade with himselfe, that in two <hi>knightes</hi> could bée comprehended so great force and strength. So these two <hi>knightes</hi> continued in the second battaile more then one hower, and no vauntage could bée knowne béetwéene them, although both of them, had done to the vttermost that was in their power, force &amp; strength. And for that they were both of them of very bigge bodies, and the trauaile great which they had passed, and the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and mighty blowes by the one and the other receued,
<pb facs="tcp:13970:162"/>
did so much torment them, that they were brought vnto the estate, that their strengthes did faile them, in such sort that eyther of them was at that estate, and thought verely to be ouercome.</p>
               <p>So when that <hi>Rodaran,</hi> saw that his contention did little profit him, &amp; could not help himselfe in the battaile, he then called to remembrance, that which the quéene <hi>Carmania,</hi> had aduised him off, &amp; was, that in that place wheras she was, he should finde ease, at such time as hee found himselfe in the greatest necessitie in the battaile, which caused him little &amp; litle to retire backwards towardes the place whereas shee was, giuing &amp; receiuing blowes, as the time did serue.</p>
               <p>The Prince <hi>Brandizel,</hi> likewise at that time was in that perplexitie that he was ready to yeelde himselfe for to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome, but when he saw that <hi>Rodaran,</hi> did begin to retire, with the great ioy &amp; pleasure which hée receiued to see him so vpon a sodaine to fainte, that he began a new to recouer his force &amp; strength, &amp; followed him, striking at him with all the might he could, but his faintnesse and warinesse was so great, that he could scarce life one leg after an other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for to follow him: the which when <hi>Rodaran</hi> did perceiue, he would with a very good will haue returned to haue made resistance for that it seemed vnto him that in a small time hée should ouercome him, for that the prince was so weary and féeble, But when he would haue forced himselfe thervnto, hée fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he was wholy depriued of his strength, &amp; his armes so sore with wearinesse, that he was constrained still to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire backwardes, till such time as he himselfe &amp; the prince, were wholy vnder the uaut or arch of the second tower of the bridge, wheras the queene <hi>Carmania,</hi> nigh vnto the same, sate in hir estate. Who when she saw that these two knights were so weary that almost they could not stand vpon theyr feete.</p>
               <p>She pulled a corde of Silke which hanged by hir, &amp; came downe from the height of the arch, which caused that arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:13970:162"/>
net of yron to fall down vpon both those <hi>knights,</hi> in such sort, that their heades were fast in the net, &amp; their legs and armes so fast bound with all their body, and with so great strength, that they were not able to turne them selues on the one side nor on the other, but were taken prisoners in such sort, that if they were not made loose by other, it were a thing impossible to be loosed.</p>
               <p>So when this was done, the quéene arose vp from the place wheras she sat, &amp; commanded a great chaine to be brought, &amp; the helme of the prince to be taken off, &amp; the chaine to be put about his neck, likewise they made his hands fast with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nakils, that he was not able to moue nor to doe any thing.</p>
               <p>Then she commanded a gentlewoman that a key should be brought, wherewith she did open a lock that the not was made fast with all, &amp; cleered out of the net, both the prince &amp; <hi>Rodaran.</hi> They being out, the cord was pulled, &amp; the net car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried vp againe into the place whereas it was before. But when this valiant prince <hi>Brandizel,</hi> saw himselfe betraied &amp; prisoner, he thought verily to haue burst with anger: &amp; with great yre &amp; wrath he said vnto <hi>Rodaran.</hi> 
                  <q>Oh false &amp; traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>knight,</hi> what reason hath moued thée being a <hi>knight</hi> of so great power &amp; strength in armes, &amp; of so high estate, for to commit so great treason, against one alone knight, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king battaile against thée, his body against thine.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Tell mee traitour, how canst thou consent to be called <hi>knight,</hi> when thou dost vse so great villanie vnto the noble order of <hi>Knighthood.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>How canst thou praise and extoll thy selfe, in the great <hi>Asia,</hi> to haue ouercome and gotten the victory ouer <hi>knights of Grecia,</hi> when that with so great falsehood &amp; treason thou hast apprehended them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rodaran,</hi> was verye much amazed at this which the Quéene had done, and at the great subtilnesse of the arte where with shée did assure him of this victory against those Grecian <hi>Knightes,</hi> And for that béefore this time, he dyd not

know the secret of hir polesie, &amp; making himselfe very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant therof, he answered &amp; said. Thou hast no reason, prince of <hi>Persia,</hi> to call me traitour, for that in all my life time I haue not committed any treason. And héere I doe sweare vnto thée by the high god<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, that I was as ignorant of this which the quéene hath done, as thy selfe. And retiring back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards towards hir, was, for that I being weary in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile &amp; very faint, I thought by the sight of hir to recoyer some force and strength, for that the loue which I doe bear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Well said the Prince, séeing it is so that thou art without fault, do so much that my helme may be brought vnto me again, &amp; that this chaine may be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, &amp; let vs returne againe vnto our battaile. I will not consent ther vnto said the quéene, for that thou art my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner. And <hi>Rodaran,</hi> shall not giue vnto this liberty. Then lady said the prince, giue it you vnto me, for no longer time, then to make an end of our battaile: &amp; that being finished, I doe promise you by the faith of a <hi>knight,</hi> to returne againe vnto your person. For vnto such a lady as you are, what so euer <hi>knight</hi> he be, wil thinke well to be your prisoner.</p>
               <p>Truely I doe like as ill of this as of the other, sayde the Quéene of <hi>Carmania,</hi> for that at such time as the battayle shalbe finished betwéene thée &amp; <hi>Rodaran,</hi> thou shalt remaine in such pitifull case, that I shall receiue no profit of thy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment. Therfore goe your wayes at this time &amp; beare company with the other <hi>Knights</hi> of the emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> and giue them some comfort, for that they are very sad and sorrowfull, to finde themselues prisoners: and very shortlie we will send others for to comfort thée also. And take this of a certainty, that we will not carry you from hence till such time as we haue all the best <hi>Knights</hi> that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Trebatio</hi> hath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> héere prisoners, to beare you company.</p>
               <p>And forth with they carried the prince away from thence who was so angry and furious, that it séemed that he felt no
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:13970:163"/>
wearynesse of the battaile past, but rather if all the world were his, he would giue it, vpon condition that he had on his healme, &amp; his sword in his hand, for to take reuengement of this treason vpon <hi>Rodaran.</hi> So they tooke him &amp; put him in to a deepe dungion next the water, which was in the second tower wheras the other two <hi>knights Rodamarte &amp; Rodaseo were,</hi> who were greatly amazed when they saw the prince <hi>Brandizel</hi> to be brought in that order, thinking that hee had ben ouercome by <hi>Rodaran,</hi> but the prince who knew them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, with the great sorrow and griefe that he receiued when he saw them, he gaue them to vnderstand of all that which had happened betwixt him &amp; <hi>Rodaran,</hi> &amp; of the great treason which the Queene had ordained, wherby they were fully perswaded that all the rest of the <hi>knights</hi> which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the court of the emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> would be brought thether prisoners, if they had not some aduertisment giuen them therof.

And straight waies after that the Quéene <hi>Carmania</hi> vnderstood who the prince was, she sent a damsell of hirs vnto him who did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arme him, &amp; caused him to be laid in a bed which was brought thether, whereas he was cured with very good &amp; comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ointments, of those great blows which he receiued, wher with all his body was full &amp; his flesh all to brused, whereby was giuen to vnderstand the great contention that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him &amp; <hi>Rodaran.</hi> The squier of the Prince who remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without, receiued great contentment when he saw <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daran</hi> retire backwards, ready to yéeld the victory, &amp; hauing lost the sight of both these two <hi>Knights,</hi> when they entred in vnder the second tower, he remained ther to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what the end would bée, till such time as hée saw <hi>Rodaran re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne</hi> with his sword in his hand, who commaunded the gates of the first tower to be opened, and being very much amazed because he could not sée his Lord, hée ran vnto the

To whom <hi>Rodaran</hi> said, he is ouercome &amp; hath lost the victory, &amp; doth remaine prisoner, therfore doe thou returne vnto the emperour, &amp; bid him send other <hi>knights,</hi> &amp; such as can better defend themselues then those which he hath sent hetherto, for that these doe remaine my prisoners. The squier durst not giue him any answere, but departed from thence very sorrowfull, &amp; with great we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, he returned vnto <hi>Constantinople,</hi> &amp; at such time as the emperour was accompanied with all his princes &amp; <hi>knights,</hi> he entred into the great hall wheras they wer, &amp; ther he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto them the newes, and all that had passed, with is much sorrow, that he was scarce able to tell it vnto them.

               <p>Ualyant King, I pray God grant vnto you the victory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst that strong &amp; stout pagan, &amp; deliuer thée from trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for I doe beléeue that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> imprisonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of such <hi>knights</hi> can not bée without some treason or falsehoode. So after that the king <hi>Sacridoro</hi> was departed, the <hi>knight of the Sun said,</hi>

that if ther were not some treason vsed with <hi>Rodaran,</hi> that the prince <hi>Brandizel</hi> would rather consent to die then to bee ouercome. And of this your highnesse may be well assured, said <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> that if the king <hi>Sacridoro</hi> doe not end this contention, that all we shall haue inough to doe with <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daran,</hi> for except it were with the <hi>Knight of the Sun</hi> my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I neuer met with so valiant a <hi>knight.</hi> I holde him for no lesse, said the Emperour, for his presence doth performe the same, &amp; the same which we haue heard of him. In all this life, although the imprisonment of the thrée princes were some griefe vnto them, yet for all that they ceased not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to make great feasts &amp; sports throughout all the great citie, &amp; in the Emperours pallaice, wheras euery day the princesse <hi>Claridiana</hi> came &amp; many other ladies &amp; gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, they had great plesure &amp; delight in making amongst themselues so great feasts &amp; sports, that they passed away all the time in great pleasure &amp; pastimes, although the iealous thoughts of the princes <hi>Lindabrides</hi> wold not by any meanes suffer hir to reioyce hir selfe in any kind of pastime, but it was the occasion that she receiued the greater griefe, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the princes <hi>Claridiana</hi> at all times was in presence, &amp; hir great beautie &amp; gentill grace would not suffer hir to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure hir selfe of the great loue shée had vnto the <hi>knight of the Sun,</hi> who alwaies when he was in presence of these two ladies, was so troubled, that all that were ther present dyd greatlye meruaile that hée was so quiet and hadde so few wordes, and the other for that he was no more wearyer, of the which the princesse <hi>Claridiana</hi> did not let but had some suspition of that which hir great beautie and desert dyd as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure hir. And béecause the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> didde not behold hir, and cast his eye vppon hir, so often as shée desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, she was in a great confusion and troubled within hir selfe, not knowing whether hée did it or no, for that hée would not haue that those which were ther present should haue any suspition of the loue that hée bare vnto hir,

or whether the presence of the princes <hi>Lindabrides</hi> did cause any forgetfullnesse of his part towards hir.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He valiaunt King <hi>Sacridoro</hi> after that hée was departed out of the great hall, went straight vnto his lodging, wheras hee was armed with his strong and rich armour, &amp; mounting vpon a mighty great and light horse, accompanied with one alone page, for to cary his speare, he departed out of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> &amp; with the great desire he had to proue himselfe with <hi>Rodaran,</hi> in a short time he came vnto the bridge, &amp; as soone as <hi>Rodaran</hi> had discouered him from the top of one of the towers, he straight way armed himselfe with his strong &amp; rich armour &amp; being mounted vpon his horse, he commanded that the gates of the first tower should be opened, wherat the king <hi>Sacridoro</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, with his speare in his hand, &amp; straight waies the gates were shut againe, leauing his page without, who did as the squier of <hi>Brandizel</hi> did, procure wher he might see &amp; beholde the battaile. The king <hi>Sacridoro</hi> as soone as he was within, found <hi>Rodaran</hi> mounted vpon his horse, and very well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, with his speare in his hand, whom hée did salute ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye curteouslie. To whom <hi>Rndaran</hi> said, <hi>knight,</hi> thou art welcome, for that according vnto the semblance and good proportion, thou shouldest be one of the best esteemed <hi>knights</hi> that the emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> hath in all his Court. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray thée tell mee who thou art, that I may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand with whom I shall make battayle, and I am sure if the emperour doe send thée, it is to amend the faults of the

Prince of <hi>Persia,</hi> and it should appeare that thou art in great estimation, for to come and reuenge the Prince, who was so valyaunt, that I neuer in all my lyfe had so much trauayle to ouercome one <hi>knight.</hi> To whom the King aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered and sayde.

Of a truth I haue heard great talke of him (sayd <hi>Rodaran</hi>) for that in all <hi>Asia</hi> ther is not a thing more noysed and published abroade, then the great aduenture which hée finished in the caue of <hi>Phenicia.</hi> And one of the chiefest occasions which hath brought me into this country is, for to proue my selfe with him, for that I cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

To whom the king answered, of my faith I doo promise thée, that if once thou doost prooue him, hée will bring thée out of this doubt, for all that thou hast heard speak in him, is nothing, in comparison of that which thou shalt finde of him, if thou doost once prooue him. Truth it is thou hast ouercome &amp; got the victorie of such <hi>knights,</hi> that there bee few in the world like vnto them, and although I doo come hether to combat with thée, I doo come more for to put my selfe out of doubt, of a mistrust that I haue, for that I cannot beeléeue that thou couldest get the victory of them without some falsehood or deceite, and for to thinck that I can doo more against thee then they were able, for in all things, they were able to amend my faults. Thou shalt straight wayes sée, sayde <hi>Rodaran,</hi> whether that my power and force bée able to dooe more then this or no. And ther with he turned about his horse, and tooke so much scope as was sufficient for his Horse. The King did the like, so both of them with their Speares in their hands, broched their furious Horsses, who made their course with so great swiftnesse, that quickly they were together, whereas they did execute the force and strength of their furious encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb facs="tcp:13970:166"/>
and shieuered their Speares all to péeces vppon theyr fine armour, after that they had glanced from their shéelds, and with the force of their furious encounter, their horses ioyned together with their mightie bodies, that horse and man fell vpon the ground, and béeing fast in their saddles, the euill fortune of the king <hi>Sacridoro</hi> was such, that one of his logges doubled vnder his Horse, in such sort, that by no meanes hée could pull it out, nor cléere himselfe to arise againe, and <hi>Rodaran</hi> with the force of the mightie fall, was so astonyed and amazed, that voyde of remembraunce hée lay along vpon the ground without moouing hand or foote, but as one that were dead. The occasion thereof was, for that hée was so big membred and footed withall, that the rigorous fall was more perillous vnto him then vnto the king <hi>Sacridoro.</hi> But when the Quéene <hi>Carmania</hi> saw all that had passed, shée arose vp from the place wheras shée sat in companie with all hir Ladies, and came whereas these two <hi>Knights</hi> were on the ground, and tooke of <hi>Rodarans</hi> healme and gaue him aire, so that hee came againe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe presently, and arose vp on his féete, and was greatlie amazed at the great strength of the king <hi>Sacridoro,</hi> &amp; went towards him, who with very anger was readie to burst, to sée himselfe in that great extremitie, and could not help himselfe. <hi>Rodaran</hi> pulled of his healme from his head, and tooke his swoord from him, and made fast a mightie great chaine vnto his legge, and put a payre of manacles vpon his hands, and so carried him prisoner whereas the other Princes were, with so great sorrow and griefe for that which had happened, that if it had not béene for the losse of his soule, hée would haue slaine himselfe. And when the other Princes did know the valyaunt king <hi>Sacridoro,</hi> their sorow and paine dyd double increase. And when eyther of them had tolde him all that they had passed with <hi>Rodaran,</hi> hée and all the rest were very sad and heauie, for that they did béeléeue of certaintie, if God did not put remedie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, it were not possible that there should remaine any good <hi>knight,</hi> but bee brought all to prison. So there they remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:13970:166"/>
all foure together very sorrowfull, til their fortune did procure to the contrarie, but their sorrow and griefe was not so much to sée themselues so in prison, as <hi>Rodaran</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ioy and pleasure, for the good fortune that hée had with the King <hi>Sacridoro,</hi> for that according vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that hée receiued of him hée should haue passed great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie, if hée had ioyned with him in battaile with theyr swoords, so that at this time hée made little account of the rest of the <hi>knights</hi> which remained, because hee had brought into his power these other past, who were very valiant and of great prowesse. The Page of the King <hi>Sacridoro</hi> when hée saw his Lord carried to prison and his healme from his head, after hee had made that great encounter, he would tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie no longer, but with great sorrow returned vnto <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> whereas hée gaue the Emperour to vnderstand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and griefe was so much that the Emperour receiued, that hee wold haue armed himselfe, and haue gone and proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued himselfe with <hi>Rodaran,</hi> but that his sonne <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> who receiued greatest griefe for the imprisonment of the king <hi>Sacridoro,</hi> and was the fifth to whom the lot dyd fall out to follow the demaund. Without any more tarrying hée asked lisence of his Father, who committing him vnto God, dyd graunt it vnto him, saying.</p>
               <p>My welbeeloued and good sonne, vse thy selfe in such sort that thou maist reuenge the iniurie done vnto thy friends. And in this thing I doo acknowledge the great benefit that God hath done vnto mée, in that I doo know thée and thy Brother to bée my sonnes, which is the occasion that my court is so greatly honoured with so many valiant <hi>knights,</hi> and now in this time that <hi>Rodaran</hi> hath put vs into this great extremitie, which would haue fallen out very euill if wée should haue lacked you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13970:167"/>But whereas your highnesse is, said <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> we might bée well forborne, for if it were so that wée were all prisoners vnto <hi>Rodaran,</hi> wée should receiue great comfort, and haue our libertie very certaine, if you alone did remaine. God deliuer you from this, said the Emperour, for although ther should be no lack in my good will to receiue death to set you at liberty, yet my force &amp; strength should want for to supplie the lack of such <hi>knights.</hi> And therwith <hi>Rosicleer</hi> dyd humble himselfe vnto the Emperour, and departed out of the great hall, &amp; went vnto his lodging for to arme himselfe, leauing the Emperour and all the rest very ioyfull, bée leeuing of a certaintie, that for his great bountie &amp; mightie power, ther was not a <hi>Knight</hi> in all the world (setting a part his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the inuinsible <hi>Knight of the Sunne</hi>) that might bée com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vnto him.

and béeing sore troubled within his thoughts, oftentimes hée had lost his way, if his page which went with him had not put him in remembrance, which was the occasion that hée made the time long before hée came vnto the bridge, and for that the remembraunce of <hi>Don Siluerio</hi> dyd cause vnto him great sorrow and griefe, that many times hée sayd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himselfe: Oh if God were so pleased, that in satisfaction of the great trauayle which the Princesse <hi>Oliuia</hi> hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed mée to haue, that this <hi>knight</hi> were <hi>Don Siluerio,</hi> hée that I doo now goe to seeke, and although the great fauour which hée hath, is sufficient to defend him from all the world, yet the great reason which I haue to complaine my selfe, is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that I dooe execute vpon him this my great anger &amp; wrath.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou haue heard what great sorrow &amp; griefe the newes of the death of <hi>Rosicleer</hi> did cause in the Court of the King <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> &amp; likewise how ioyfull the prince <hi>Don Siluerio</hi> was, for that the king had giuen him his word &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise that the princesse <hi>Oliuia</hi> should marrye with him, but he did not so much desire it, as the princes did hate him. For although that the heauy newes of the death of <hi>Rosicleer</hi> did touch hir very neere, yet she repented hir selfe so much, for that crueltie which she had vsed vnto him, &amp; the great loue that the remembrance of him did cause in hir, that rather she would consent to death, then agree vnto that which the king hir father had requested of hir diuers and sundry times. And for that the prince <hi>Don Siluerio</hi> dyd many times importune the king to performe his promise, which was the thing he most desired. Who answered him, that till such time as he had ended the wars which hée had with the emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> hee could not by any meanes conclude with the princes, which was the occasion that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually he passed the time in grieuous passions, supposing that it was for no other thing, but a pollisie, to cause the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse to giue hir father such an answere as should be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his will &amp; desire. And because the time to giue case and remedy vnto his desire was so long, and he not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, (his sorrow and griefe was such) the delay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Upon a day, at such time as he found the princesse <hi>Roda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silua</hi> all alone he did verye earnestly desire hir, that by all wayes and meanes possible she should learne to know of the Princesse <hi>Oliuia</hi> the truth of the aunswere which shée

made vnto the king hir father at such time as he tolde hir that he would marry hir with him, whether, it was with good will and determined purpose to accomplish the same at the time appointed, or whether she did it to prolong the time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moued by some hatred towards him, for that according vnto hir answere, he would determine what were best for him to doe. Then the princesse <hi>Rodasilua</hi> who had great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to vse remedy and to case the sorrowfull passions of hir brother, did promise him to doe all that euer in hir power was possible to be done, &amp; so tooke hir leaue &amp; departed from him, &amp; waited hir time. It chanced afterward vpon a day at such time as the princesse <hi>Oliuia</hi> was alone in hir closet, she went &amp; knocked at the doore, &amp; being knowen who she was, the doore was opened straight waies, &amp; she went in, &amp; found the princesse with hir countenance very heauy &amp; sorrowfull, and hir eyes swollen with continuall wéeping, &amp; hir faire chéekes which before were wont to be rudy &amp; full, was now so leane &amp; wan, as though she had ben new risin out of some great sicknesse or infirmity. And finding hir in this order, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moued thereby vnto great compassion, she said: What is this my lady &amp; mistres, is it not sufficient, the time wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I serued you for maid of honor, &amp; the great good will that continully I had in any thing that did appertaine vnto your seruice, in the which I was alwaies faithfull &amp; true, &amp; do I not now deserue to know the occasion wherefore, and from whence doth procéede (that wheras at other times you were wont to be very merry &amp; ioyfull, &amp; giuen to pleasure &amp; pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, &amp; now vpon the sodaine to be so sorrowfull &amp; sad) for that I haue séene your great beauty &amp; fairenesse to snrmou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t all other damsels &amp; gentlewomen in the world, &amp; now I doe sée all lost &amp; in a mortall hew.

The <hi>knight</hi> was very glad and ioyfull when he heard that newes, for that it was the thing that at that time hée most desired, and thinking the time long to know where hee might finde him, hee sayd. Of a truth sir <hi>Knight,</hi> although there had béene no occasion of your part to binde mée to declare vnto you the occasion of my comming, your great curtesie and gentle disposition is sufficient to cause mée to declare vnto you that which you doo demaund, and to binde mee to doo in your seruice any other thing whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer your pleasure is to commaund mée.</p>

And when they saw the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> to come, all to be raied with blood, the knig straight waies did imagine what had passed with him &amp; embraced him saying: Oh my good &amp; perfect friend now I am fully perswaded that it hath pleased god to give mée full remedy, &amp; set at liberty all my kingdome, onely in that I haue your valiant person héere with me. At this time the most principallest of all the <hi>knights</hi> of the citie came vnto them, &amp; with great contentment &amp; ioy to sée their Lord and king they entred into the citie, &amp; commanded the gates to be shut very strongly, &amp; excéeding good watch &amp; ward to bée kept, &amp; they altogether went vnto the pallace, wheras they were of the quéene meruailously well receiued &amp; entertained and did vnarme the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> with hir own hands, and there they did repose &amp; rest themselues that night, not without great care &amp; complaints vnto their king, to see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in such great affliction, &amp; almost all the people in their Country lost.</p>
               <p>Likewise also was the valiant <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> sore trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with his amorous thoughts of the faire princes <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brides,</hi> and of the princesse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> which thoughts were more troublesome vnto him then the furious battaile which he should haue with his enemies the next day following.

The first a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all those Knights that went foorth, was Brother vnto the King, called <hi>Momfriero,</hi> a valiant Knight and stout of his person, and worthie in feates of armes, and such a one, that in all the Pagan Countrie there was found verie few, so gallant and so liuelie in any kinde of exercise, and meruailous presumptious, who béeing mounted vppon a great and furious courser whet out of the camp, and with great threatnings and oaths hée swore that with the first encounter that hee should make with his speare, for to bring him prisoner vnto the King.

Then the king of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> who from his Tent did béeholde all that passed, béeing greatly amazed to sée his brother ouerthrowen, sent another knight called <hi>Rufier,</hi> who was a great Lord in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia,</hi> and one of the most brauest that hée had in all the camp, who being mounted on a mighty courser went out of the camp, with so great pride &amp; arrogancie, that hée thought verely to reuenge the iniurie done vnto <hi>Momfriero,</hi> but his expectation fell out cleane contrarie, for when hée came to make his encounter with the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> hée gaue him such a blow with his speare, that he pearced him quite through, that hée ouerthrew him dead vnto the ground, and breaking his speare therewith, hée drew out his great and sharp cutting swoord, and in his companie the King <hi>Lyseo,</hi> they put themselues into the presse of the Campe whereas they made great slaughter, killing and ouerthrowing as though they had béen all naked without armour: Oh how ioyfull were all those of the Citie, when they saw the great meruailes of their Captaines, and theyr great boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and surmounted strength, and to the contrarie how the King of <hi>Arcadia</hi> was amazed when that hée saw two alone knights for to doo so great murther and destruction in his mightie and puissant armie, and sayde with himselfe, that if all the world should haue tould him the lyke, hée could not haue béeléeued it, except hée had séene it with his owne eyes, and for that hée would sée more of theyr wonderfull déedes, hée dyd not procure to arme himselfe, neither would hée mooue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the place whereas hée was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but

Then the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> béecause they should not take so great paines as to come vnto them whereas they were, but seeing them a far off to come towards them, hee went foorth to méete them, and scarcely they could haue so much lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure as to life vp theyr mases for to strike them, when that the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> with great lightnesse stroke one of those Gyants with his swoord in both his hands so terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a blow vpon his right shoulder, that hee cut him downe to his bowells, in such sort, that the fore quarter with his right arme did part from his body, and he fell from his horse dead to the ground.

and because his mighty cutting sword could not enter ther in, yet it tooke away the sight of his eies, &amp; ther flew so many sparks of fire out therat, that it séemed the whole helme, to burne ther with, but yet for all that this valiant warriour was nothing amazed or astonied thereat, but procuring to giue him his payment for the same, stroke him so terrible a blow, that out of all remembrance he made him fall backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vpon his horse crouper, &amp; his horse caried him round about the field, voiding at his mouth &amp; nose great abundance of blood.

<pb facs="tcp:13970:198"/>
and being mounted on a strong &amp; light horse he went out of the camp with his speare in his hand, saying: Oh that my fortune wer so good, that as I go against this valiant <hi>knight,</hi> I might make battaile against all my false gods, in whom I haue beleeued &amp; put my confidence, for if they were all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, &amp; they were <hi>knights</hi> in this world, I think verily to ouercome them all, &amp; make them to know &amp; vnderstand that the power &amp; strength of this <hi>knight</hi> is much more then theirs. The king had not fully concluded in saying these words, when the valiant <hi>Pirro</hi> with one blow that the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> gaue him with his swoord, fell from his horse as though hée had béene dead, but when the King saw that, with wonderfull force he went towards him, &amp; with a great &amp; broad fauchon in his hand he stroke the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> vpon the helme, that it tooke way the sight of his eyes, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued him of his vnderstanding, and his horse caried him a while about the field, for you shall vnderstand that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of <hi>Arcadia</hi> was so stout &amp; couragious a <hi>knight,</hi> that neuer any <hi>knight</hi> with whom he did make battaile with, could endure with him a whole day in the field, &amp; was of great fame and feared amongst the pagans, but yet he did not goe away boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting himselfe of this blow, for the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> before the king could strike him the second, returned &amp; came again to himself, &amp; set spurs vnto his horse, &amp; came running against the king like a whirle wind, &amp; with his swoord in both his hands he stroke him such a blow vpon his healme, that hée made him to fall forwards vpon his horse necke, &amp; the blood ran out both at his mouth &amp; nose, and his horse carried him round about the field out of his remembrance, as though he had ben dead, at which time <hi>Alberro</hi> was come againe to himselfe, and he and <hi>Gruto</hi> together did terribly assault the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> chargeing him with great and heauye blowes, the which he felt and grieued him very much for though his armour did defend him from wounding, yet for all that it could not excuse him, but that his flesh must haue

yet this good <hi>Knight</hi> had not seene them, for that he was occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in disimbarking himselfe with them that he had before him, vpon whom he stroke such mortall blowes, that some of them he cut a sunder in the midst, and other some he cloue down to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> teeth, &amp; others to their brests, with such mortall destruction, that in a smal time ther remained not one of all their enemies aliue in the tent, for that the princes <hi>Claridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> did worthely defend the entry, in wounding &amp; killing all those that came nigh vnto hir. At this time because the king <hi>Liseo</hi> had seene all that the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> had done, &amp; how farre hée had put himselfe in amongst his enemies, hauing great desire either to be slaine or else to sée an end of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, all such as were within the citie &amp; able to weare ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, went forth to aid the <hi>knight</hi> of the sun if néede so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, they put themselues amongst their euemies, defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that none should come &amp; giue succour vnto the king, who still with <hi>Rodaran</hi> were in a sound &amp; from themselues, &amp; as they came al forth with desire to die or to be at liberty, like mad dogs they put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues amongst their enemies, &amp; slew many of them, but in especiall the good king <hi>Liseo</hi> who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer stroke blow, but that he slew or ouerthrew a <hi>knight</hi> to the ground, &amp; by reason of the great hurt &amp; damage which they of the camp receiued on that side hauing great néed of aid &amp; succour, they all did leaue the battaile at the tent and went thether, although there remained not so few agaynst the Princesse, but that she had mough to doe.

but the emperour with a tender loue, more then of a father, in shedding many teares that ranne downe by his chéekes, with great ioy and pleasure he did embrace him, saying: I was very certaine &amp; sure, my welbeloued son, that we should not lack your aid &amp; succour in the time of this our great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie, &amp; heere I giue great thanks vnto the soueraigne cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, that by his mightie power you were sent at this time to giue vs liberty.

All this time was the quéene <hi>Carmania</hi> hidden in a closet of the same tent, so heauy &amp; sad to see all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> passed, that she thought with very sorrow to haue died. And in the meane time that the emperour &amp; the rest were arming of themselues in great hast, the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> returned to succour and help that <hi>Knight,</hi> whom he left defending of the doore of the tent, that none should enter in therat, &amp; it was that worthy &amp; royall princesse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> whom he found very brauely and stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye combatting with a great number of <hi>knights,</hi> and hadde before hir at the entry of the Tent, very many slaine and wounded, and for that she kept hir selfe in the inside of the entry, she defended hir selfe the better from all that came against hir.

So at this time the good emperour and all the rest of those worthy princes &amp; <hi>knights</hi> were armed, &amp; with their swords drawen in their handes with the greatest fury in all the world they went out of the tent, and as those which had a great desire to reuenge themselues in a small time they made such a slaughter amongst their enimies, that they thought it best to giue them way, so that they had time &amp; space inough to prouide themselues of horses, of those which ran round about the field of the <hi>knights</hi> that were slaine, &amp; when they were all mounted on horsback they ioyned themselues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in an ambushment &amp; put themselues in the midst of all the battaile with so great fury, &amp; stroke such cruell &amp; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall blowes, that ther were none in all the camp that durst abide beefore them.

and likewise all good and valyaunt Knights in the world. Then the Princesse who receiued great contentment at his words, layd hir armes vpon his shoulders and sayd: Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Prince, your politike dealings and excellent bountie sooth so far excell, that it is not needefull for mée to expresse the same, neyther any other, but onely to béehold what is done by your valiant hands heere in this Camp, and vnto this there is good witnesse, who is the king <hi>Liseo</hi> and all his knights. And passing beetwixt them many other amorous words, the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> dyd tell them all how and by what aduenture hée came thether, and all that happened with him after hee departed out of <hi>Greece.</hi> The like dyd the Princesse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> so that all the whole companie vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by what order they were there assembled and ioyned. In the meane time that they were in this acknowledging one another, those of <hi>Lidia</hi> were not idle, for they minded no other thing but to robbe and destroy all that were in the Tents and Campe of the King of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> and finding there great store of riches and treasure which the king had brought, euery one of them did so lade themselues, that euer after they remayned very rich, and thought their long and great trauaile to bee well employed, the end fell out so pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous vnto them.

great misfortune: but when the King of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> dyd look<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Likewise when <hi>Rodaran,</hi> saw all his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners at libertie, and hée ouercome by one alone Knight, the great sorrow and griefe which he receiued, could not bée héere expressed, and if hee had had his helme and his swoord, and on horsebacke, hee would haue tarryed there no longer. Then strayght wayes the King <hi>Lyseo,</hi> dyd desire all these worthie warriers, to repaire vnto the Citie for to refresh themselues, and to take their ease, who consented vnto his request, and went towards the citie, and carryed with them theyr prisoners, whereas they were receiued of all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens and nobles of all the kingdome, that were there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, with so great ioy and triumphes, that the whole Citie seemed to bée on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

So when they came vnto the Queenes pallace, who was very wyse and discréete, shée receiued them with such courtesie, as was requisit to so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble persons: whereas they were all vnarmed, and recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with verie swéet waters and oyntments requisit for such hurts and bruses as they had receiued. For although theyr armour dyd defend them from wounding, yet could not their flesh bée free from bruses, by the force of such terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blowes as they receiued. And in especiall the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> in the battaile which hée had with <hi>Rodaran,</hi> and the King of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> although hee estéemed it in nothing, with the great contentment and pleasure which hee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in seeing béefore him the fayre Princesse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> not hée alone who loued hir as his owne soule, dyd receiue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, but likewise the Emperour, &amp; the other princes &amp; <hi>knights</hi> did reioyse very much, &amp; had hir in that reputation as hir high estate deserued.

               <head>¶ How the Empresse Briana was deliuered of a sonne, and of the great feasts that were made at his birth. Chapter. 52</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is said in this famous history that the mightie emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> had another and the third son, by the faire empresse <hi>Briana,</hi> of whom is made great mencion in the second part of this history, for that was one of the most mightiest &amp; famous <hi>knights</hi> in all the world, &amp; that next vnto his singuled bretheren the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> &amp; <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> ther was none equall vnto him, &amp; many times combatting with his bretheren vnknowen, he put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in great hazard, &amp; with either of them he hath maintayned battaile almost a whole day, &amp; in the end it was very small the vantage they had of him, so that this valiant <hi>knight</hi> did finish so many mortall déedes, that they deserue to be spoken of, &amp; to be put in the number of his bretheren, &amp; in all other things, as in body &amp; stature, he was conformable &amp; equal vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, &amp; did resemble so much the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> in his face, that many times he was taken for him, &amp; if it were not that he was of fewer yéeres, with great difficulty might you know the one from the other. This valiant &amp; fortunat prince, as the wise <hi>Artemidoro</hi> saith, was borne straight after the emperour and all his company came from the kingdome of <hi>Lidia,</hi> for that when that stout Pagan <hi>Rodaran</hi> came into <hi>Greece,</hi> the empresse was very big with child. It doth apéere that the wise <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> doth make difference, for hée doth make no mencion of this yong gentleman, till the conclusion of the great battailes which they passed betwéene the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Alicandro</hi> of <hi>Tartaria,</hi> and the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> from which time he doth declare meruailous &amp; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull things done by him. I doe beléeue that the occasion of this is, because that the wise <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> did not sée him, till
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:13970:211"/>
such time as he came into <hi>Greece,</hi> &amp; made no mention of him till all the battaile was finished, &amp; at such time as the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour &amp; all the rest tooke their rest with great ioy &amp; pleasure, after the great trauaile which they receiued in the wars past, for that at this time the young gentleman, was verye tender of yeares, &amp; passed not sixe yéeres of age, so that till that time ther is no more mention made of him, then is in this chapter, but afterwards these two wise men doe begin to writ of him meruailous great &amp; wonderfull déeds, &amp; doo both agrée in their writings. When the time was come that this royall empresse should be deliuered ther chaunced a thing of great admiration &amp; meruaile, which did shew &amp; declare a very high and great mistery in the birth of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And time did come that it was perfectly seene &amp; proued to be true all that this wise man had told them, for that by his occasion the most part of the orientall regions were turned into the christian faith and true beléefe in Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>After this which the wise man had told him, as also for

that the child was borne very faire.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ong time was the Princesse <hi>Lindabrides</hi> in the court of the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> without hauing any mirth, ioy or pleasure, for that she saw that the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> did frequent very much with the princesse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> and that it seemed vnto hir that he did not loue hir, as before time he did, &amp; being fully perswaded, that alone the presence of the princesse was the occasion of all hir euill, many times she imagined with hir selfe how and by what meanes she might take him away from the same, for that hir great beauty might take effect in him, so that shée might liue in more security, and for that hir minde was alwaies troubled ther with, in the end shée determined to doo as you shall heare. Upon a day at such time as was ioyned together the Emperour &amp; all the Princes and worthy <hi>knights</hi> of the court with the empresse &amp; the princesse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> &amp; all their Ladies &amp; gentlewomen, making great feasts &amp; pastimes in the great hall, at such time as they were most in quiet, the princesse <hi>Lindabrides</hi> rose vp &amp; stood on hir féet, &amp; when they saw hir demeanour they all held their peace.</p>
               <p>Then she began to speake saying.</p>
               <p>High &amp; mightie Emperour of <hi>Greece,</hi> if valiant princes &amp; mightie <hi>knights</hi> for the maintaining of their honours, are bound to respect ladies &amp; damsels in their necessities, as by their promise &amp; oath made, at such time as they doe receiue the order of <hi>knighthood:</hi> in how much more are bound so high princes &amp; <hi>knights</hi> as are heere present, to respect a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of so high estate as I am, who is banished from hir natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, &amp; come into this, as vnto the court of the most hghest king &amp; emperour in all the world. And heere I say of truth that if the remedy of my necessitie doth now faile me according as I would haue it, &amp; denied me by so high princes, with iust reason may I account my selfe for an vnhappye damsell. Therfore now in the presence of you all I doo aske a boone of the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> who is heere present, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:13970:213"/>
I doe request that it may be by him granted vnto me, and likewise consented, by you most high &amp; mighty Emperour &amp; Empresse. All that were ther present were very much ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at the words of the princesse, not knowing what should be the occasion why she should aske that boone. And first shee would haue the grant before she would declare hir demand. Then the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> séeing that the princesse would not declare, but first he must be bound, he was somewhat in a confusion, although he made no outward shew therof: but vpon a sodaine, he arose vp, &amp; answered hir, saying. My good Lady, if the dutie which I haue to serue so high a damsell as you are, you doo not esteeme in more, then in giuing of my word, héere I doo graunt vnto you the boone, which you haue asked of me, although of the securitie I am agréeued, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the benefits which I haue receiued. Uery well sayd the princesse, séeing that you haue granted me of your part, likewise I desire the emperour, &amp; my Lady the empresse, to consent &amp; graunt vnto the same, that I may bée sure of all parts. We doo graunt vnto the same, said the Emperour &amp; the empresse, laughing very much at the security which the princesse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>emanded. Now shall you vnderstand the boone the which I doo craue, saide the Princesse. For so much as the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> did ouercome the prince <hi>Meridian</hi> my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; that I remained in his power, that now he cary me vnto the court of the Emperour my father, whereas it is great reason that I doo retourne, being so long since my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from thence. And this I will that he shall doo, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hauing the company of any other. When the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> heard the boone which the princesse demaunded, hee was in a great confusion, but the princesse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> was in a greater, but yet shée made signes vnto him with hir eyes, that hée should grant vnto hir all that euer shée would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, for that it seemed vnto hir, that with his hon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

court of the Emperour hir father, &amp; although it grieued the emperour &amp; the empresse very much, yet ther was no other remedy, but he must consent vnto the same by the voice of all the rest, &amp; being concluded, their departure was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be within eight daies following, with great ioy vnto the princes <hi>Lindabrides,</hi> &amp; much griefe vnto the princesse <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridiana,</hi> who seeing that the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> must needs ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent himselfe from hir, &amp; that it was for his honor to depart into far countries, hir sorrowfull heuines was so great, that she could not dissemble so much, but some part thereof was discouered, &amp; especially considering the perillous companye that he had with him, for that in hir presence, she had no feare of the princesse <hi>Lindabrides,</hi> for that the singularity of hir ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent beautye did fully assure hir, but in hir absence shee knew not what continuall conuersation of the princes, with the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> would work, and being much troubled with this thought, she called vnto hir a damsell, one of them that was most priuat with hir, &amp; said: <hi>Arcania</hi> my welbelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued damsell, as vnto the most trustiest &amp; faithfullest seruant the which I haue, I will commit one thing into thy hands, the which doth importune no more but to haue continuall pleasure, ioy, &amp; quietnesse, or els sorrow &amp; heauinesse all the dates of my life, and I would you should put such diligence therm, as euer you haue had in things which belongeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. You doo vnderstand how that the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> hath promised vnto the princesse <hi>Lindabrides</hi> to goe with hir and beare hir company vnto the court of the emperour hir father, &amp; I knowing the great worthinesse of the <hi>knight</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> as well in his owne person, as in his high estate &amp; bl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nd from whence he doth discend, I am fully determined in my hart, consenting thervnto my father the Emperour and the Empresse my Mother, to take him for my husband, as the most highest and mightiest Knight in all the world, and for the accomplishing and performing of this, I finde nothing more contrary, then the great beautye

The shining beames of your sight hath so kindled my thoughts, that they be all occupied in your seruice, and hath likewise scorched all my inward parts, and all my sences are blinde, my body all to peeces, and my soule as immortal alwaies.

would shew me this pleasure of remedy, then shall not I be able to receiue it at your hands.</p>
               <p>And in concluding these words, the <hi>knight</hi> of the Sun with as great courage as euer he had, went vnto hir &amp; kissed hir on one of hir faire cheekes.

So receiuing great contentment for the acknowledge of the <hi>Princesse,</hi> as also to know that shée should bée married to so valiant a knight, with great ioy &amp; plesure hée said.

This tower was scituated, vpon a high rock, very strong, &amp; nygh vnto a very broad &amp; déepe riuer, &amp; walled round about. And the king kept the keies therof, for that he would that none should enter in therat for to visit the Princes, for that she seeing hir selfe so solitary, &amp; in so great straightnes, would be the occasion, that she would yéeld hir selfe vnto mariage, &amp; to doo all that the kings pleasure was to command hir, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were all onely for to be cléere of so straight &amp; soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary life.

And séeing that she would giue hir newes of hir embassage, she was againe so sodainly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that she had no hart to heare hir, but looked so pale, as though she had ben dead, trembling with all hir body &amp; flesh, as though she had ben afraide to heare what <hi>Fidelia</hi> would say. Who with a gentle laughter to see the princes in that case, shée said.

When <hi>Brandamar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi> came vnto the Tents, he touched one of the shields with his speare, and straight waies the owner therof came forth, mounted vpon a mightie horse, and comming vnto the iust, (because the knight of <hi>Lusitania</hi> was very valiaunt) yet <hi>Brandamarte</hi> was much more, and ouerthrew the other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ground, and without any farther delay hée touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed other sixe sheeldes, and at the first encounters he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the owners of them to the ground, which gave great contentment vnto the king <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> and vnto all those of the Country, for that hee defended so valianutlie

The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the prince <hi>Don Siluerio,</hi> who was in his tent, hard by the place wheras the king was, with great pride &amp; contentment that he had of the honour, which his <hi>knights</hi> had got, he said vnto the king. Now mightie king you shall vnderstand, that not without great cause the <hi>knights</hi> of <hi>Lusitania,</hi> are estéemed for the best <hi>knightes</hi> in all the world, for that in any place whersoeuer they beecome, they neuer loose, but alwaies get honor.

not consist in the <hi>knights</hi> of <hi>Lusitania,</hi> for that I haue seene in this country such, that if they were héere now at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, that all your <hi>knights</hi> would get by them but litle honor. Then the prince said, I would that god were so pleased, that those <hi>knights</hi> were héere now at this time, for that I &amp; my <hi>knights</hi> would very quickly bring you out of this doubt. So at this time, some of the <hi>knights</hi> of <hi>Lusitania,</hi> were very ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the honour &amp; victory which they had receiued, &amp; other some as sad &amp; sorrowfull, for the reproch &amp; shame happened vnto them, by the <hi>knights</hi> of the country, at which time vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a sodaine &amp; vnlooked for, they saw two <hi>knights</hi> which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into that mightie place, of so gallant &amp; gentle dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; well armed, as euer they saw in all their liues, of the which, one of them vpon his mightie horse did put himselfe right ouer against the great pallas, &amp; the other went vnto the tents of the <hi>knights</hi> of <hi>Lusitania,</hi> and touched one of the <hi>knights</hi> shields with his speare, and straight way the owner therof came foorth. And this strange &amp; venterous <hi>knight,</hi> made his encounter with so great strength, that in the middest of that great place, hee ouerthrew him from his horse to the ground, his heeles vpwards, &amp; so far from himself as though he had ben dead.</p>
               <p>Then straight waies came forth an other, who with great lightnes he shoued him out of the saddle, so that he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in mens armes &amp; caried him into the tent, for that all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bones of his body were shaken &amp; brused, with that strongs encounter.

Then <hi>Bramides</hi> of <hi>Lusitania</hi> came foorth mounted vpon a myghtye great horse, &amp; with a big speare in his hand he gaue a turne about the place, shewing great prid, &amp; thinking certainly that at the first encounter he would ouerthrow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> valiant <hi>knight,</hi> but it fell not out according vnto his expectation, for that they made their incounter with such force that <hi>Bramides</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the shéeld of the strange <hi>knight</hi> shéeuered his speare all to shéeuers, but the <hi>knight</hi> made no shew of moouing in his sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, but he made his encounter so strongly against <hi>Bramides,</hi> that heauing him right out of his sadle, he caried him a good way off from his horse, with his head to the ground and his héeles vpwards, &amp; was so astonied with that terrible blow, that hée could not arise from the ground, till such time as some of his companions tooke him vp, &amp; caried him into their tent.

issued out of the forrest, and entered into the citie, &amp; for that ther were so many <hi>knights,</hi> as well strangers as Countrie men, they could not be perceiued, for the stréets were full of them, &amp; likewise the night being darke, theyr armour could not be discouered, neither was ther any account made ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for that it was a time void of suspition, so they drew nigh vnto the pallace, at such time as the Princesse <hi>Oliuia</hi> &amp; the Prince <hi>Don Siluerio</hi> should ioyne hands together, vowing matrimonie, the pallace being cléere &amp; light with the great number of torches and candles that were ther lighted, that it seemed to bée mid day, and there were so great a number of people, that they could scarce mooue by one another. All this time went <hi>Fidelia</hi> very diligently vp and downe the pallace, and when shée saw the houre draw néere that theyr pretence should be put in execution, she went out of the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and taking with hir a bundle of things necessarie for the princesse, she went towards the sea side, and put hir selfe in the ship, abiding the time to sée what fortune would doo for hir Lady and mistres, and for those worthy and valiant Knights, and was in so great feare, that for any thing shée would not bée put in the like againe. All this time was the Princesse <hi>Oliuia</hi> so full of anguish and alteration, that shée knew not whether shée were aliue or dead, and béeing in a quadran nigh vnto the great hall, accompanied with all hir Ladies &amp; damsels, readie to bée taken foorth to ioyne hands with the Prince, shée many times fell in a sound, and béeing very much comforted by the Princesses <hi>Rodasilua</hi> &amp; <hi>Silueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> yet all that euer they could doo did profit very little, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could shée recouer any force nor receiue any comfort, for that the houre was come that she shuld passe that great affliction, and in remembraunce thereof shée thought verily that hir hart would haue leapt out of hir dody.

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:13970:247"/>
so they went vp a narrow payre of stayres till they came into the great hall, whereas they found the King <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerio,</hi> with all those mighty Princes and knights, in a fayre Quadran, in company with the prince <hi>Don Siluerio,</hi> abiding the comming of the Princesse <hi>Oliuia,</hi> to take hir to his spouse. Lykewise on the other side of the hall in another Quadran was the Princesse <hi>Oliuia,</hi> accompanied with all hir Ladies and Damsels, and with the Princesse <hi>Rodasilua</hi> and <hi>Siluerina,</hi> who had hir in the midst beetwixt them, and when they would haue gone whereas the King was, the Princesse <hi>Oliuia</hi> could not step one foot forwards, but fell in a sound in the armes of the other Princesses. Then when these two valiant knights saw it was time, they entered both together into the quadran, and the king <hi>Sacridoro</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed his Swoord drawen in his hand, and his shéeld on his arme, the which put a great teare amongst all the Ladyes and Damsels, and <hi>Rosicleer</hi> went straight vnto the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse <hi>Oliuia</hi> his Lady, and tooke hir in his armes, lifting hir from the ground, all which time shée was in a sound, and by reason at theyr entering in, all those Ladyes and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells gaue great shrikes and out cryes, there came pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to that place many Knights, and béeing without armour they drew out theyr Swoords, and doubled theyr cloakes about theyr armes, and went to rescue and take away the Princesse from <hi>Rosicleer,</hi> who carried hir in his armes, but for that the good King <hi>Sacridoro</hi> was at hand in a redinesse, with foure blows which hée gaue, hée ouerthrew foure Knights dead to the ground, of them that first appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched wher they were, the which did put so great feare in all the rest, that they durst not come nigh him, so that <hi>Rosicleer</hi> had roome to come vnto the narrow stayres, which descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded downe to the false doore.

The which counsayle lyked the Prince very well, and vnderstanding the will of <hi>Brandizell,</hi> hée strayght wayes sayde that hee should dooe all that his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure was, for that hee should receyue great contentment therein. So both of them asked lisence of the Emperour for to depart, promising him to returne againe so soone as they heard that the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> was returned agayne. So the Emperor (although very much against his will, and by theyr great importunancie) did grant leaue vnto them. So these two perfect friends departed from <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and when they came vnto the waters side, they entered into a ship which they found readie to depart towards the kingdome of <hi>Polonia.</hi> After that they were departed &amp; had sayled on theyr voyage foure dayes, there beegan to arise a great storme at the sea, and at midnight the winde began to blow so terrible, and the Sea to worke so far out of all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that sometimes they thought that the waues carryed the ship vp into the cloudes, and other tymes they thought the Ship to fall downe to the deapth thereof, and the Ship receiued such a leake, that whatsoeuer the marriners could doo with the Pompe and otherwise, yet might they goe vp to the knees in water aboue the balest, for the which cause these two good knights made no other reckoning but to bée lost, which caused them with all theyr harts to praye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God to haue mercie on them, and to forgiue them theyr sinnes, and also if it were his diuine pleasure to delyuer them out of that great torment. When the day was come those boysterous windes dyd so beate the Ship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and tossing it from one part to another, in such fort, that it could no longer indure, but opened a sunder in the midest, so that these two Knights had no other refuge, but

Then God who dyd reserue them for a greater effect, did deliuer them that they were not drowned in that torment, for that they had not fully halfe an houre. sustained themselues vpon their planks in the water, when that those mightie high and great waues dyd carrye them vpon the shoare. The Prince <hi>Brandizel</hi> in <hi>Polonia,</hi> and the Prince <hi>Clauerindo</hi> vpon an Iland that séemed to bée full of thick and gréene trées, who when hée was vpon the shoare, and saw himself cléere of that great torment, he gaue great thanckes vnto almightie God for his wonderfull benefits shewed vnto him in that his deliuerance, &amp; dyd very much lament the losse of his friend <hi>Brandizel,</hi> not knowing what was béecome of him. And béeing very desirous to know in what Countrie hée was, finding a narrow and small vsed way, hée followed the same, and trauayling therein a mile, hée meruayled very much that hée could sée no people, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anie towne or inhabitaunce, the Countrie béeing so fresh and full of Trées that it séemed vnto him neuer in all his lyfe to haue séene a Countrie so delightsome. So after a great while that hée had trauayled by that narrow path, at such time as the <hi>Sun</hi> béegan to waxe hot, and found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe out from amongst those trées, hee entered into a great and wide plaine, in the midst of the which hée saw a mightie high and well towred Castle, the which was of <hi>Lyndaraza,</hi> the sight wherof put him in great admiration, and it séemed vnto him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it could not bee wrought by any humane hands, and beeing very desirous to know who it shuld be that was Lord of that meruaylous Castle, hée hasted his pace more then béefore, and went towards the same, and the nigher hee came to it the more hée meruayled.</p>
               <p>So when hée came and saw that wide and déepe ditch, and that there was no other entrie into the Castell but onelie by the bridge, hée went thether, and found that the gate was shut, and hauing at the ring thereof a very fayre and rich horne of <hi>Iuorie,</hi> with a scroule vpon it which sayde.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:13970:255"/>Thou Knight, whose fortune hath brought thée hether, if thou art determined to know anie thing of this great and strong Castle, blow this horne, and thou shalt not lacke one to make thee aunswere, and haue a great care in defending thy selfe from the Porter, for that hee will put thy lyfe in great perill.</p>
               <p>The Prince heereat was very much amazed, and could not imagine what it should bee, but hauing a great desire to know what should bée within, without any longer tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and with a valiant courage hée tooke the horne and put it to his mouth, &amp; béegan to sound it with so great strength, that the sound was heard throughout all the Castell, and hée had not scarce pulled the Horne from his mouth, when that with a great rushing and noyse the gates were open, and there issued out at the gate a furious beast called <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> and the most horrible and euill fauouredst that euer was séene formed by nature, for that his body was as big as two good horses, and his legges more bigger then a buls legge, and each legge had fiue clawes, and the least of them was a span long, and as bigge as a mans finger, and his mouth so bigge, that a man might well goe in thereat, and was all furnished with very big tuskes, and as sharp as a rasour, and hée threw out at his mouth great abundaunce of fire and smoake, in such sort, that it séemed to bée Hell mouth, and hée came foorth with so great brauenesse, that there was no man but onely at the sight of hir would haue receiued great feare. And as soone as this <hi>Brama</hi> was come foorth, it went strayght wayes towards the Prince, and in his hastynesse hée would haue gored him with his sharp tuskes, but the Prince who was polytike and very lyght, gaue a leape on the one side, and cléered himselfe from the fury thereof, and passing by him with his swoord hée thrust so terrible a foyne at that monster, that chancing béetwéene two ribs, it entered into his body vp to the hilts, and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the sword out, there followed great abundance of blood out at the wound. Then when the furious <hi>Brama</hi> felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hurt, with as great fury as euer was séene, he returned
<pb facs="tcp:13970:256"/>
vnto the Prince, who bearing his head very lowe, in such sort, that by no meanes hee could defende himselfe, but must of force abide his fury, who stroke him with his tuskes so terrible a blow, that hee threw him from the ground tenne paces from him backwards, so that if his armour had not béene made by that wise man <hi>Lyrgandeo,</hi> at that blow hée had parted him a sunder in the midst, yet for all that, the Prince was so euill intreated with the mightie fall, that if hée had not béene of so valiant a courage, it had not béene possible for him to haue risen agayne from the ground, but by reason that hée was one of the most valiantest Knights in all the world, with a trise hée arose vp agayne, and at such time as this furious <hi>Brama</hi> came<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> towards him againe, for to claspe him béetwixt his cruell and sharp clawes, hée firmed himselfe sure vpon his féete, and tooke his sword in both his hands, and determined to put his lyfe in aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in striking of one blow, and so hee dyd, for at such time as this <hi>Brama</hi> came vnto him, hée stroke him so stronge a blow with both his hands vppon his monstrous head, and for that his Swoord was very good and sharpe, and stroke with so good a will of the Prince, that it cloue it cleane a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder, and the sword entered into the ground a good span, so that the monstrous beast fell downe dead to the ground beefore the Prince, who praysed God greatly for that victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie which hee had, and remayned a good while bee houlding that great beast, and was very much amazed at his strange forme and furious composition, and béeing very desirous to know and vnderstand the ende of that straunge aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without any longer tarrying hee entered in at the great gates that were open, and as hee went in vnder the first tower, lookeing on the one side, hee saw proportioned on the wall, his perfect friend the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and it was so arteficially done, that it seemed to bee himselfe in person, and beeing greatly amazed thereat, hée stayed to hée<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> holde the whole circumstaunce thereof, and there hee saw the thrée first battailes the which hee made vpon the bridge, paynted very naturally.
