         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to be <hi>a man of God, a
Seer in Israel,</hi> by those things
<pb facs="tcp:29272:3"/>
which without controule,
have already passed the
presse. Might I have my
with, it should bee no more
but a double portion of that
Spirit of God which was in
him. The divine light,
which radiated into his
breast, displaies it selfe in
many other of his labours,
but yet is no where more
condens'd than in this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
It's truly sayd of
<hi>Moses,</hi> by faith <hi>hee saw him
that was invisible, Heb.</hi> 11. 27.</p>
            <p>And S. <hi>Paul</hi> prayes for the
Ephesians, <hi>that they might
know the love of that which
passeth knowledge, Eph</hi> 3. 19.
These things imply a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction;
yet in like phrase
I feare not to say of this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
&amp; Brother, <hi>he saw those
things which eye hath not seen,
<pb facs="tcp:29272:3"/>
spake those things which eare
hath not heard, and uttered
those things which have not
entred into the heart of man
to conceive.</hi> This knot needs
no cutting: hee that rightly
understands the text, will
easily looke through this
mystery, without the helpe
of an Hyperbole. His scope
was to stirre us up to love
God: his motive to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade,
is taken from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
of those things
which God hath prepared
for them who love him.
That excellencie is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in a strange manner. By
intimating it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
no nor so much as
comprehended by any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
abilitie of the body or
minde; yet it is expressed
in the doctrine of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
<pb facs="tcp:29272:4"/>
sufficiently. So as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
as in a glasse, we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the glory of God, and
in beholding, bee changed
from glory to glory. What
duty more necessary than
to love God? what motive
more effectuall than the
Gospell? for <hi>what is the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
but a revelation of such
things as naturall men could
never invent?</hi> Such things,
that is, so pretious, so useful,
so comfortable to us; so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
admirable, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
in themselves. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of us are like the Angell
of Ephesue, <hi>Wee have lost our
first love. Rev.</hi> 2. 4. yea as our
Saviour prophesied, <hi>Matth.
24. 12. The love of many maxes
cold.</hi> One reason may bee,
because to see to, wee reape
so little fruit of our love.
<pb facs="tcp:29272:4"/>
Were it so, that we had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in hand, no present
pay, that we served God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
upon trust without
so much as an earnest: yet
there is something <hi>prepared.</hi>
Let us believe that, and our
hearts cannot but bee war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
wee shall then bee fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
in spirit, serving the
Lord. Be we perswaded of
that, <hi>God is not unrighteous,
to forget your worke, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

6. 10. and then wee may tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly

Who shall separate us from the

There is this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
natural sight and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall.
The one requires
some nearnesse of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
the other perceives

things at greatest distance
As Faith makes future
things present, so it makes
remote things near, &amp; things
prepared to affect as if they
were enjoyed. But what
hath God prepared? If I

whereby the rich plenty of
the divine blessings and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits

               <note place="margin">The cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> (the
Trumpet of the
Gospell, the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of election) was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to bee a messenger
of reconciliation, and to
spread the sweet savour of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29272:13"/>
the Gospell every where:
And answerably to his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
hee makes way for
the excellencie of his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage
into the hearts of
those he had to deale with.
This he doth by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of his function.
And that he might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
prevaile, hee removes
all objections to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
There were some
that would debase his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
saying, that the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
he taught (Christ cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified)
was no such great
matter: Therefore in the
6. verse of this chapter, hee
shewes, <hi>that the Gospell is
Wisedome, and that among
them that are perfect;</hi> among
the best and ablest to judge.
St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not build as the
Papists doe now, upon the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29272:13"/>
blindnesse of the people.
But it were not Poperie, if
they did not infatuate the
people. St. <hi>Paul</hi> sayth to
this effect:<note place="margin">The best Ministers will not shun to be tried by the best judgments</note> Wee dare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale
to those that are the
best, and of the best judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
let them judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be wisedome or no:
the more perfect men are,
the more able they are to
judge of our wisedome.</p>
            <p>It might bee objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
You see who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ares for
your wisedome, neither
<hi>Herod,</hi> nor <hi>Pilate,</hi> nor the
greatmen and Potentates,
the Scribes, and Pharisees,
great, learned men, and
withall, men of innocent
lives, notable for carriage.
Therefore, sayth he, <hi>Wee
speak not the wisedome of this
world, or the Princes of this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29272:14"/>
world, that come to nought.</hi>
Doe not tell us of such
mens wisedome, they and
their wisedome will come
to nought too. Wee teach
wisedome of things that are
eternall, to make men eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.
As for the Princes of
the world, they and all that
they know, their thoughts,
and all their plots and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises
perish. But <hi>wee speake
the wisedome of God in a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie,</hi>
That is the wisedome
of Gods revealing, a deepe
wisedome, a mysterie, that
<hi>God or dained before the world.</hi>
Ancient wisedom, not a ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdayes
knowledge, tho
lately discovered: the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the Gospell is the
discovery of that wisdome
that was hidden before the
world was.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:29272:14"/>
And to invite you, and
make you more in love
with it, it is a wisedome <hi>To
your glory.</hi> God hath a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to shew himselfe wise
in devising a plot to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
poore wretched man.</p>
            <p>As for the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<note place="margin">Scope of the words, and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> they are a proofe of
what he had sayd before,
why none of the Princes of
the world knew this great
mysterie. If so be that the
eye of any man hath not
seene, nor the eare of any
man hath heard, nor the
heart of any man hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
what doe you tell
us of the wise men, which
were not all, nay what
should I speake of men? the
very Angels (as we know by
other places) are excluded
from a full knowledge of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29272:15"/>
these mysteries. Therefore
it is no mervaile,<note place="margin">The myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Gospell hidden from natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall men.</note> though
none of the Princes of this
world knew them. They
are universally hidden
from all naturall men. This
I take to be the sence of the
words. They are taken out
of <hi>Isaiah:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isai. 64. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> delights
to prove things by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets:
but here it is not so
much a proofe as an allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
which we must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to understand many
such places. For <hi>Isaiah</hi> there
speakes of the great things
God had done for his
Church, such as <hi>Eye had not
seene, nor Ea e heard:</hi> And
the Apostle alludes to it
here, and addes somewhat,
This clause (nor hath entred
into the heart of man) is not
in that place: but it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29272:15"/>
understood: for if
the eye doe not see, and the
eare heare, it never enters
into the heart of man. For
whatsoever enters into the
heart of man, it must be by
those passages and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,
the gates of the
soule, the sences.</p>
            <p>And whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi>
sayth, <hi>For them that love
him,</hi> It is for them that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
him, as in <hi>Isaiah.</hi> The
sence is all one: Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
love God, they expect
and wait for him, where
there is no expectation,
there is no love.</p>
            <p>This is the Apostles drift,
If God did doe such great
matters for his Church, as
eye hath not seen, nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>are
heard, according to the
Prophet Isuiah, what shall
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29272:16"/>
we thinke he will do in the
kingdome of grace here,
and of glory hereafter.</p>
            <p>The words then as wee
see, containe the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of the mysteries of the
Gospell, described first by
the hiddennesse of it to
men at first.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the things revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
such as <hi>neither eye hath
seene,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The hiddennesse and
excellency of the Gospell
in that respect, is set forth
by way of negation, <hi>Eye
hath not seen, nor Eare heard,
nor Heart conceived.</hi> And
indeed this is the way to set
forth excellent Divine
things.<note place="margin">The way to set forth divine things.</note> God himselfe is set
out by way of deniall; by
removing imperfections, he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29272:16"/>
is invisible, immortall, &amp;c.
And so heaven, that is neare
to God, as being prepared
by him, it is set out by way
of deniall, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> sayth,
<hi>It is an inheritance immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.</note>
undefiled, &amp;c. 1. Pet. 1.</p>
            <p>So here, positive words
could not be found suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to set out the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of the things that God
hath prepared.</p>
            <p>As for the Knowledge of
the mysterie of salvation in
Jesus Christ, we neither can
come to it by naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
nor by naturall
discipline. All the things
that we know naturally, we
know by one of these two
wayes, but divine things
are knowne neither way.</p>
            <p>Where could there have
been any knowledge of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29272:17"/>
Christ, if God had not ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
his breast in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
and come forth of his
hidden light, and shewed
himselfe in Christ, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and in publishing the
Gospell, established an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of preaching for
this purpose, where had the
knowledge of salvation in
Christ been?</p>
            <p>To prove this, wee have
here a gradation: the eye
sees many things; but wee
heare more things than we
see, yet <hi>neither Eye hath seen,
nor eare hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the heart, are lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than the sight of the

of,<note place="margin">What is meant by those things the eye hath not seen.</note> be especially the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and comforts, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges to bee enjoyed in
this life, and the consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and perfection of
them in heaven. Christ
brings peace, and joy, justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
&amp; sanctification, &amp;c.
the like. And even in this
life; the perfection of these
is in heaven, where the soul
and the body shall be both
glorified, in a glorious

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29272:18"/>
Sonne, and holy Ghost, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable

These are those
things that eye hath not

here, and the perfection
and consummation of them
hereafter. Having thus
farre unfolded the words,
I come to the poynts consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

of beloved children
in the world, that he means
a speciall good unto.</p>
            <p>The second, God hath
prepared great matters for
them.</p>
            <p>If great persons prepare
great things for those
whom they greatly affect,
shall we not thinke that the
great God will prepare
great things for those that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:29272:18"/>
hee hath affection to, and
that have affection to him?
If God be a friend to the l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
&amp; they be his friends,
surely he wil answer friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to the utmost: answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to the great love he
beares his children, he hath
provided great things for
them.</p>
            <p>If that bee excellent that
is long in preparing, then
those things which belong
to Gods children, must
needs be excellent: for
they were preparing even
before the world was. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi>
Temple was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Fabrick, it had long
preparation. <hi>Ahasueros</hi>
made a feast to 127. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
it was long in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring:
great things have
great preparation. Now
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29272:19"/>
these things that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
his children, have
been preparing even from
everlasting, and they are
from everlasting to everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting:
they must needs bee
excellent. But before I
dwell on any particular
poyn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, here is a question to
be answered.</p>
            <p>If the things that God
hath prepared for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,<note place="margin">A question</note>
be secret and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
how then come we to
know them at all?</p>
            <p>We come to know them
1. by Divine Revelation.
God must reveale them
first, as it is in the next vers.
<hi>God hath revealed them by his
spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
               <note place="margin">God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals secret things that are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to his children.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Spirit reveales them
by way of negation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely,
as also by way of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29272:19"/>
eminence. Whatsoever is
excellent in the world, God
borrowes it, to set out the
excellencie of the things
that hee hath provided for
his Children in grace, and
glory.</p>
            <p>A feast is a comfortable
things they are called a
Feast. A Kingdome is a
glorious thing; they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a Kingdome. Marriage
is a sweet thing; they are
set forth by that, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
and adoption of
children, and such like: So
that all these things are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e shadowes of those
things. And indeed they
are but shadows, the reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
is the heavenly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of grace and glory:
the heavenly riches, the
heavenly inheritance, the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29272:20"/>
heavenly sonship: when all
these things vanish, and
come to nothing: then
comes in the true King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
Sonship, and Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Againe, 2. wee know
them in this world <hi>by way of
taste:</hi> for the things of the
life to come, there are few
of them, but Gods children
have some experimentall
taste of them in this world:
God reserves not all for the
life to come, but he gives a
grape of <hi>Canaan</hi> in this wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by arguing from
the lesse to the greater: If
peace of conscience bee so
sweet here; what is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
peace? If a litle joy
here bee so pleasant and
comfortable, that it makes
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:29272:20"/>
us forget our selves, what
will bee that eternall joy
there? If the delights of a
kingdome bee such, that
they fill mens hearts so full
of contentment, that oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they know not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
what shall we think
of that excellent kingdom?
So by way of taste and rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
we may rise from these
pettie things, to those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
things, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
are scarce a beame,
scarce a drop of those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> when
they were in the mountain,
were not their owne men,
when they saw but a
glimpse, but a little glorie
of Christ manifested in the
mount, what shal we think,
when there is the fulnesse
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29272:21"/>
of that glorious revelation,
at the right hand of God,
where there is fulnesse of
pleasures for ever? How
shall our soules be filled at
that time? Thus by way of
rising from the lesser to the
greater, by tasting, feeling,
and by divine revelation,
wee may know in some
measure the excellencie of
those things prepared for
us.</p>
            <p>Now to cleare this thing
more fully,<note place="margin">Three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of revelation.</note> know that there
are three degrees of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First there must bee a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
by word, and writing,
or speech,</hi> and the like, as we
know not the minde of a
man, but either by speech,
or writing: so there must
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:29272:21"/>
bee a revelation of these
things; or else the wit of
Angels could never have
devised, how to reconcile
Justice and Mercie, by infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
wisedome; by sending
a Mediator to procure
peace, God-man, to worke
our salvation. Therefore
wee could not know them
without a revelation, and
discoverie outward: this
is the first degree that wee
may call Revelation by
scripture, or by the doctrine
of the Gospel. Who could
discover those things that
are meerly supernaturall,
but God himselfe?</p>
            <p>Then againe 2. when
they are revealed by the
word of God, and by men
that have a function to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
the unsearchable ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:29272:22"/>
of Christ, by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie
of the Gospell, yet
notwithstanding they are
hidden riddles still, to a
company of carnall men.
Put case the vaile be taken
off from the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
yet if the vaile bee
over the soule, the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
will, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
there is no apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them: therefore <hi>there
must bee a second revelation,
that is, by the Spirit of God.</hi>
Ofnecessitie this must bee:
for even as the Apostle
sayth in this Chapter, <hi>None
knoweth the minde of Man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 11.</note>
               <hi>but the spirit that is in Man:</hi>
so none knoweth the mind
of God, but the Spirit of
God. What is the Gospel
without the Spirit of Christ,
to discover the minde of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29272:22"/>
God to us? We know not
the good meaning of God
to us in particular:<note place="margin">The Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is hid, without the Spirit to discover the minde of God.</note> wee
know in generall that such
things are revealed in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
but what is that to us,
if Christ bee not our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and God our Father?
unlesse we can say as S. <hi>Paul</hi>
sayth, <hi>He loved me, and gave
himselfe for mee.</hi> Therefore
you see a necessitie of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
by the Spirit.</p>
            <p>But this is not all that is
here meant, there is 3ly a
higher discovery, and that
is in heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
here, is but in part.
and thereupon if wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
wee believe but in
part, and wee love but in
part, If our knowledge,
which is the ground of all
other graces and affections,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:29272:23"/>
be imperfect, all that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
must needs bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
also. Therefore St.
<hi>Iohn</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 2.</note> 
               <hi>We know that wee
are the Sonnes of God, but it
appeares not what we shall bee.</hi>
What we shall be in heaven
it doth not appeare now;
there must bee a further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
and that will bee
hereafter, when our soules
shall bee united together
with our bodies: and then
indeed our eyes shall see,
our ears heare, and hearts
shall conceive those things
that while wee are here in
the wombe of the Church,
wee neither can see nor
heare, nor understand,
more than the childe in the
wombe of the mother can
conceive the excellencies in
this civill life. Thus we see
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:29272:23"/>
these truths a little more
unfolded. I will now adde
somewhat to make use of
what hath been spoken.</p>
            <p>First of all therefore for
matter of instruction,<note place="margin">1. Vse. Instruction</note> if it
be so, that the things of the
Gospell bee such, as that
without a revelation from
God, they could not bee
knowen, then we see, that
<hi>there is no principle at all of
the Gospel in nature.</hi> There is
not a sparke of light, or any
inclination to the Gospell
but it is meerly above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
for hee removes here,
all naturall wayes of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Gospell, eye, eare,
&amp; understanding: therfore
the knowledge of it is
meerly supernaturall. For
if God had not revealed it,
who could ever have devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29272:24"/>
it? And when hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
it, to discover it by
his Spirit, it is supernatural:
but in heaven much more,
which is the third degree I
spake of.<note place="margin">Why so many he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Gospel.</note> Therfore (by the
way) you may know the
reason why so many here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
have sprung out of the
Gospel, more than out of
he Law, &amp; the misundersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of it. There are few
or no heresies from that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the principles of the
Law are writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the heart:
men naturally know that
whoredome, and adulterie,
and filthy living, &amp;c. are
sins; men have not so quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
nature, but that they
know that those things are
naught: therefore there
have been excellent Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers
amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the heathens.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:29272:24"/>
But the Gospel is a meere
<hi>mystery</hi> discoured out of the
breast of God, without all
principles of nature: there
are thousands of errors that
are not to be reckoned, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the nature, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
&amp; the benefits of Christ,
about justification, and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
and free will
and grace, and such things,
what a world of heresies,
have proud wits conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
started up? This
would never have beene
but that the Gospell is a
thing above nature. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when a proud wit, and
supernaturall knowledge
revealed meete together:
the proude heart stormes,
and loves to struggle, and
deviseth this thing and that
thing to commend it selfe,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29272:25"/>
and hereupon comes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
the mingling of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
wit with divine
truthes. If men had had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
wits to submit to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
truthes, and to worke
nothing out of themselves,
as the spider out of her
own bowells, there had not
beene such heresies in the
Church, but their hearts
meeting with supernaturall
truthes, their proud hearts
mingling with it, they have
devised these errours that I
note in the first place.</p>
            <p>Then againe if the things
that wee have in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
be such divine truthes
above nature altogether:<note place="margin">2. Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. In d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>vine truths a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wee are not to trust to reason too much.</note>
               <hi>Then we must not stand to
looke for reason too much, nor
trust the reason or wit of any
man, but divine authority her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:29272:25"/>
especially.</hi> For if divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
cease in the Gospel,
what were it? nothing; the
law is written in mens
hearts: but we must trust
divine authoritie in the
Gospel above al other por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of scripture, and not to
the wit of any man whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that
is possest with a Spirit of
pride, and Ignorance and
tyranny; they will force
knowledge on them that be
under them, from their sole
authoritie; <hi>the Church, saith
so; and wee are the Church, and
it is not for you to know, &amp;c.
and scriptures are so and so;</hi>
but is the Gospell a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
mysterie above the
capacitie of any man? and
shall we build upon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:29272:26"/>
of the Church for
these truthes? oh no! there
must bee no forcing of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicall
truthes from
the authority or parts of
any man. But these are not
things that wee stand in so
much need of, therefore I
hasten to that which is
more usefull. <hi>Eye hath not
seene, nor eare heard, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here then we have <hi>an use

               <note place="margin">An use of direction. How to study and read di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truths</note>

how shall we study them?
Wee thinke to breake into

Therefore in studying the
Gospell, let us come with a
spirit of faith, and a spirit
of humility, and meeknesse
there is no breaking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
these things with the
strength of parts; That hath
been the ground of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
heresies as have beene

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the key of David that

and openeth and no man shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
he hath the key of the

the understanding.</hi> And to
presse this poynt a little; if
eye hath not seene, nor eare
heard, nor hath entred into
the heart of man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
the things of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:29272:27"/>
Gospell without the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the spirit; then we
must come with this mind,
when wee come to heare
the things of the Gospell:
<hi>Lord,</hi> without thy holy spirit
they are all as a clasped
booke, they are hidden
mysteries to mee, though
they be revealed in the
Gospell. If my heart be shut
to them, they are all hidden
to me.</p>
            <p>Wee see men of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
parts are enemies to
that they teach themselves,
opposing the power of the
Gospell: whence is all this?
because they thinke only
the opening of these things
makes them divines, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
without the holy Ghost
sanctifying, and altering
the heart in some measure,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:29272:27"/>
to tast, and rellish these
things, that as they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
in themselves, so to
have some what divine in
the heart to tast these
things, it is impossible but
that the heart should rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them; and so it doth:
for when it comes to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
you must deny your
selfe in this honour, in this
pleasure, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie, now
you must venture the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
of man for this,
and that truth: the heart
riseth in scorn, and loathing
of divine truth: when it
comes to particulars they
know nothing as they
should. For when is truth
knowne, but when in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
wee stand for it, and
will neither betray it, nor do
any thing that doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:29272:28"/>
Christian? If we have not
the spirit of God to relish
truthes in particular, they
will doe us no good. And
except the spirit sanctifie
the heart of man first by
these truthes, the truth will
never be understood by the
proud, naturall heart of
man.</p>
            <p>Therefore the course
that God takes with his
children is this;<note place="margin">GODS course with his children to shew them these mysteries.</note> those that
he meanes to have; he first
inspires into their hearts
some desire to come to
heare, and attend upon the
meanes of salvation, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the Gospell, and
then under the means of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
he shines into the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
by a heavenly
light; and inspires into the
will and affections some
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:29272:28"/>
heavenly inclination to this
truth of the Gospell, to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
sanctification,
selfe-denyall, and the like:
and workes a new life, and
new sences, and upon them
wrought under the meanes
comes the soul to relish, and
to understand these my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
and then the eares,
and the eies are open to see
these things, and never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
A holy man that hath
his heart subdued by the
spirit of God in the use of
the meanes, oh, he relisheth
the point of forgivenesse of
sins, hee relisheth the point
of sanctification, he studies
it daily more, and more, and
nearer communion with
God, hee relisheth peace of
conscience, and joy in the
holy Ghost, they are sweete
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:29272:29"/>
things, and all the duties of
Christianity, because hee
makes it his maine busines
to adorne his pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ession:
and to live here, so, as hee
may live for ever hereafter.
And this must be of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie:
for marke out of the
text; If the naturall eye, and
eare, and heart can never
see nor heare, nor conceive
the things of God, must
there not be a supernaturall
eare, and eye, and heart put
into the soule? must not the

againe? If the former
frame bee not sufficient for
these things, of necessitie it
must be so.</p>
            <p>From hence learne to
arme your selves against all
scandalls: when ye see men
of parts, and account, (and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:29272:29"/>
such there may be) men of
deepe apprehensions, and
understanding in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for matter of notion,
and for the language of the
Scripture exquisite, and yet
to be proud, malicious, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of sanctity, next to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells,
none greater; consider
what is the reason: either
they have proud spirits that
despise, and neglect the
meanes of salvation altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
or if they doe come,
they come as Iudges, they
will not submit their proud
hearts to the sweet motions
of the Spirit: stumble not
at it, if such men bee both
enemies to that they teach
themselves, and those that
practise it, the reason is,
because their proud hearts
were never subdued by the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:29272:30"/>
Spirit to understand the
things they speake of. For
such a teacher understands
supernaturall things by a

reason; that is, to talk,
and discourse, &amp;c. but hee
sees not Supernaturall
things by a supernaturall
light, divine things by a
divine light. Therefore a
poore soule that heares the
things published by him,
understands them better by
the helpe of the Spirit, than
he that speakes them: bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
indeed for his use, and
comfort.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As we see, there
are some that can measure
land exactly; but the man
that oweth the land mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, he knowes the use of
the ground, and delights in
it as his owne: the other
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:29272:30"/>
can tell, here is so much
ground, &amp;c. So some Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
they can tell there are
such poynts, and so they
are raysed; and they can
bee exquisite in this: but
what profite have they by
it?</p>
            <p>The poore soule that
heares these things, by the
helpe of the Spirit, hee can
say, these are mine, as the
man for whom the ground
is measured. As it is with
those that come to a Feast,
the Physitian comes, and
sayes, this is wholsome, and
good; and this is good for
this and that, but eates no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
others that know
not these things, they eare
the meate,<note place="margin">Of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with feeling.</note> and are nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in the meane time: so
when such men discourse
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:29272:31"/>
of this and that, a poore
man that hath the Spirit,
he relisheth these things, as
his owne; the other goes
away, onely discourseth
as a Philosopher of the
meate, and eates nothing.</p>
            <p>And therfore when you
read &amp; heare these things,
content not your selves
with the first degree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation:
no, that is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
when you have done
that, desire of God to joyne
his Spirit, to give you spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
eyes, and hearts, that
you may close with Divine
truths, and be divine as the
truths are; that there may
bee a consent of the heart
with the truth: then the
word of God will be sweet
indeed.</p>
            <p>Againe, here we see this
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:29272:31"/>
divine truth, That a man
when he hath the Spirit of
God, knowes things other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than hee did know
them before, though he did
not know them by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
revelation of hearing
and reading, &amp;c. And hee
believes them otherwise
than he did before: he sees
them by a new light. It is
not the same knowledge
that an unregenerate man
hath,<note place="margin">1 Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 14. 15.</note> with that he hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
when God workes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his heart: for then it is a
divine supernatural know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
And it is not the
same faith, and beliefe: the
Spirit of God raiseth a man
up in a degree of creatures
above other men, as other
men are above beasts: hee
gives new eyes, new ears, &amp;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:29272:32"/>
a new heart;<note place="margin">Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall sight.</note> he moulds him
anew every way. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you have good men,
somtimes wonder at them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
(when God hath
touched their hearts) that
they have had such shallow
conceits of this and that
truth before. Now they
see that they were in the
darke, that they were in a
dampe before, that they
conceived things to be so
and so, and thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
some body; but when
God opens their eyes, and
takes away the skales, and
lets them see things in their
proper light, heavenly
things, by a heavenly light,
and with a heavenly eye;
they wonder at their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
foolishnesse in divinity,
especially so farre as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:29272:32"/>
the Gospell: for
there is more in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
then pure supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
divinity, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other arts in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>The Gospell I say is a
knowledge not of naturall
men,<note place="margin">It is not in nature to shew us these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries.</note> or great wits, but of
holy sanctified men. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must not think that
these things may be known
by nature, &amp;c. It is a sacred
knowledge so much as will
bring us to heaven, it is a
knowledge of holy men,
that have their hearts
brought to love and tast,
and relish that they know.
Therefore it is no wonder
though a company of men
of great partes live naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
they are no true di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
because they have no
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:29272:33"/>
true knowledge. The divell
is no divine, nor a wicked
man properly; though hee
can discourse of such things,
yet he is not properly a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine:
because he knowes
not things by a divine light,
or heavenly things by a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
light. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Gospell, it is a
knowledge of sanctified,
holy men: but to come

is: and therfore when God
enlargeth mens spirits to

themselves. And so for the
greatest good; these goods
here, this outward glory,
we can see through it. <hi>Christ</hi>
could see through all the

these are things that wee

the eye sees them, the

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:29272:37"/>
If a man should have asked
them why they wold suffer
their bodies to be misused
thus when they might have
redeemed all this with a

wee suffer these things in

            <p>And then secondly, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
the spirituall meaning of

            <p>And then thirdly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
of the full compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of them, as they
are indeed, and so they are
reserved for heaven: wee
have but a little glimpse of
them, a little light into
them in this world. Now
in this place is meant the
things that are discovered
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:29272:42"/>
in the Gospell, especially as

in the Gospell here the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,

and the consummation of

may reason from the lesser

spring and head of them
all, in whom all are, and
whence we have all, cannot
be comprehended by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
man, he can discourse
of them as far as his natural
wit conceives them; but not
understand heavenly things
in their owne light as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
things, as the things
of the Gospell.<note place="margin">Wicked men talk of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repent.</note> They can
talke of repentance (that
wee commonly speake of,
which is a mystery) but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
who knowes
repentance by the light
proper to it, but he that by
the spirit of God hath sinne
discovered to him in its
owne colours? H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> knowes
what it is to grieve for sin.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:29272:43"/>
The sicke man knowes
what it is to bee sicke: the
Phisitian knows it by defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
by books, and so he
can inlarge it: but if he be
not sicke, the sicke patient
will speake to better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
So there is a mysteryin
the common things of the
Gospell; repentance, and
griefe for sinne. A holy
man feels it another matter
because he feeles sinne dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
by the Spirit of
God:<note place="margin">A holy man feeles sin heavy.</note> and so in faith, in the
love of God, and every
grace of the Gospell is a
mystery. If one come to the
schoolemen, they will tell
you of faith, and dispute
learnedly of it, and deduce
this from that: but when
he comes to be in extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?
when the terrours of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:29272:43"/>
the Lord are upon him,
when he comes to use it, he
is a meere stranger to it: to
cast himselfe being a sinfull
creature into the armes of
Gods mercy, hee cannot
doe it without a further
light of the Spirit dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
the hidden love
of GOD to him in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular;
and so for other
graces. Therefore they do
but speake of these things,
(men that are unsanctified)
as a blind man doth of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
they inwardly scorne
the truth they speake of:
and those to whom they
speake, if by the power of
Gods Spirit they come to
profit by the things they
teach, if themselves be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,<note place="margin">Carnall men hate the light.</note>
they hate them. A car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
man believes not a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:29272:44"/>
whit of what hee sayth:
hee hath onely a common
light for the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
a common illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to understand and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
things, and a doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
gift to unfold things
for other, and not for
themselves: for themselves
they scorne them in their
hearts, and in their lives
&amp; conversations; and they
will speake as much, when
it comes to selfe-deniall in
preferment, in pleasures, in
anything that is gainfull:
tush tell him what hee hath
taught, or what hee knowes
out of the booke of God,
he cares not, hee knowes
them onely by a common
light:<note place="margin">They know them but by a common light</note> but for a particular
heavenly light with appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and taste to himself,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:29272:44"/>
springing from an alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the Spirit, hee never
knowes them so. Therefore
content not thy selfe with a
common light: for toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with our understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
God alters the taste of
the whole soule: he gives a
new eye, a new eare, to see
and heare to purpose, and
a new heart to conceive
things in another manner
than he did before.</p>
            <p>But you will aske, How
can a godly man know
them at all, seeing <hi>eye hath
not seen, nor eare heard,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I answer: First,<note place="margin">An objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered for explicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> the things
of another life (as wee see
here) are knowne by nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as God is,<note place="margin">1. Answ.</note> by way of
removing imperfections.
The naturall eye sees them
not, nor the naturall eare
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:29272:45"/>
heares them not, &amp;c. no,
nor the spirituall eye, nor
eare, in a full measure: so
things transcendent, that
are above the reach of man,
are described in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
by the way of denial,
which is one good way of
knowledge.</p>
            <p>That <hi>yee may know the
love of God that is above
knowledge,</hi> sayth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,<note place="margin">Ephes 3.</note>
               <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. that yee may
know it more and more:
but it is above all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in regard of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of it. As a man may
see the sea, but hee cannot
comprehend the sea: hee
may be much delighted in
seeing the sea, but hee sees
neither the bottome nor
the bankes, he cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
such a vaste body:
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:29272:45"/>
he may see the heavens, but
hee cannot comprehend
them. So a man may know
the things when they are
revealed, but hee cannot
comprehend them: appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
is one thing, and
comprehension is another;
there may be apprehension
in a poore degree, sutable
to the capacitie of the soule
here: but alas it is farre
from the comprehension
that we shall have in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.<note place="margin">By way of negation.</note>
That is one way of
knowing them by way of
negation, and deniall of
imperfections to them.</p>
            <p>And then secondly,<note place="margin">By way of eminence.</note> they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
are knowne (as wee call it)
by way of eminence; that
is, by comparing them with
other things, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them before all other
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:29272:46"/>
excellencies whatsoever; as
wee may see the sunne in
water by resemblance: for
God borrowes from nature
termes to set out grace, and
glory, because God will
speake in our language, for
they are called a Kingdome
and a feast, and a crowne
by way of comparison.
Shallow men thinke there
is a great deale in a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;<note place="margin">What tho we should have of the world?</note> and indeed so there
is, if there were no other.
There is great matters in a
crowne, in the feasts of
kings, and the like: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las
these be shaddowes, and
there is no Rhetoricke or
Amplification in this, to say
they be shaddowes; a shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
is as much in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the body, as these
are to eternall good things;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:29272:46"/>
the true reality of things,
are in the things of another
world, for eternity. If wee
talke of a Kingdome, let us
talke of that in heaven. If of
a crowne, of that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Saints are crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in heaven. If we talke
of riches, they are those
that make a man eternally
rich, that hee shall carrie
with him when he goes out
of the world, what riches
are those, that a man shall
out live, and die a begger,
and not have a drop to
comfort him,<note place="margin">What true r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ches are.</note> as we see <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves</hi>
in hell had not? here
are riches indeed. So if we
talke of beauty, it is the
Image of God that sets a
beauty on the soule, that
makes a man lovely in the
eye of God. True beauty is
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:29272:47"/>
to be like God.<note place="margin">What true beautie is.</note> And to bee
borne a new to that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
condition, is the birth
and inheritance. All these
poore things, are but acting
a part upon a stage for a
while, as the proudest crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of all that is invested
in them will judge ere
long; none better judges
then they. This is one way
of knowing the things of
the Gospell, by naming of
them in our owne lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
As if a man go into a
forraine country, he must
learn that language, or else
hold his peace: so God is
forced to speake in our
owne language, to tell us of
glory, and happinesse to
come under the name of
crownes, and kingdomes,
and riches here. If God
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:29272:47"/>
should set them out in their
owne lustre, wee could not
conceive of them.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, the most
comfortable way, whereby <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
Gods people know the
things of heaven, and of
the life to come, is in regard
of some <hi>tast,</hi> for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in heaven but Gods
Children have a tast of it
before they come there, in
some measure: they have
a taste of the communion
that is in heaven in the
communion they have on
earth: they have a taste of
that eternall Sabbath,<note place="margin">Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have a taste of heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come there.</note> by
some relish they have of
holy exercises in these
Christian Sabbaths. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
is as much in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
as he can be, when hee
sanctifies the holy Sabbath,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:29272:48"/>
speaking to God in the
Congregation by prayer,
and hearing God speake to
him in the preaching of the
word.<note place="margin">What peace in heaven is.</note> That peace that
wee shall have in heaven,
which is a peace uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
without any distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
it is understood by
that sweet peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
here <hi>that passeth all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</hi>
We may know
therefore what the sight of
Christ face to face will be,
by the sight wee have of
Christ now in the word
and promises: if it so trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
and affect us, that
sight that we have by
knowledge and faith here;
what will those sights doe?
So that by a grape wee may
know what <hi>Canaan</hi> is: as the
spies, they brought of the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:29272:48"/>
grapes of <hi>Canaan</hi> into the
desart: we may know by
this little taste, what those
excellent things are.</p>
            <p>The fourth way is by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
and discoverie.
St. <hi>Paul</hi> was wrapped up in
the third heaven, he sayth,
they were such things that
he saw, that could not bee
spoken of, strange things.
And Christ tels us of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Christ knew what
they were, and the word
tells us what they are: our
faith lookes to the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the word. If wee had
not the first fruits, nor any
other discoverie. God that
hath prepared them, hee
sayth so in his word, and
we must rest in his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
And there are some that
have been in heaven: Christ
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:29272:49"/>
our blessed Saviour that
hath taken into a perpetual
union, the man-hood with
the second person, which he
hath knit unto it, he knowes
what is there, and by this
meanes wee come to have
some kind of knowledge of
the things to come.</p>
            <p>Againe by a kind of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
likewise from the
lesser to the greater, we may
come to know not only the
things, but the greatnesse of
them. As, is there not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort
now in a litle glimpse, when
God shines upon a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
soule, when he is as it
were in heaven? is there
such contenment in holy
company<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>here? what shall
there be in heaven? Is there
such contentment in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
of this world, that are
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:29272:49"/>
the delights of our pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage?
they are no better,
our houses are houses of
our pilgrimage, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments
are contentments
of passengers, if the way,
the gallery that leads to
heaven, bee so spread with
comforts, what bee those
that are reserved in another
world? A man may know
by raysing his soule from
the lesser to the greater.
And if the things that God
hath provided in common
for his enemies as wel as his
friends: (as all the comforts
of this world; all the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies,
and all the objects
of the sences, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
that are common to
the enemies of God, as well
as his friends) if these things
be so excellent, that men
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:29272:50"/>
venture their soules for
them, and lose all to bee
drowned in these things:
oh! what peculiar things
are they that God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
for his owne Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
for those that love
him? when those that are
common with his enemies,
are so glorious and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent!
These kind of wayes
we may come to know them
by the helpe of the spirit.</p>
            <p>Those unmixed joyes,
those pure joyes, that are
full of themselves, and have
no tincture in heaven, are
understood by those joyes
we feele on earth, the joy
of the holy Ghost, which is
after conflict with tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or after afflictions, or
after hearing, and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on good things: the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:29272:50"/>
heavenly joyes that flow
into the soule, they give us
a taste of that full joy that
we shall have at the right
hand of God for evermore.
That comfort that we shall
have in heaven, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God, and of Christ,
and his holy Angels, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
in some little way
by the comfortable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God to the soule
of a Christian, when hee
findes the Spirit of God rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
him, and chearing
him up,<note place="margin">Heaven on earth.</note> and witnessing his
presence: as oft-times to
the comfort of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the holy Ghost witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
a presence, that now
the soule can say, <hi>God is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with me, he smiles on me,
and strengtheneth mee, and
leads mee along.</hi> This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:29272:51"/>
way Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
have to understand
the things of heaven, by
the first fruits they have
here: for God is so farre in
love with his children here
on earth, and so tender o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them, that hee purposes
not to reserve all for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world; but gives them
some taste before hand, to
make them better in love
with the things there; and
better to beare the troubles
of this world. But alas,
what is it to that that they
shall know? as it is 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi>
3. <hi>Now wee are the sonnes of
God, but it appeares not what
we shall bee:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3.</note> That shall bee
so great in comparison of
that we are, that it is sayd
not to appeare at all: it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
in the first fruits in a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:29272:51"/>
little beginnings; but alas,
what is that to that
glory that shall bee? <hi>Our
life is hid with Christ in
God.</hi> It is hid, there is no
man knowes it in regard of
the full manifestation: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
here it is covered
with so many infirmities,
&amp; afflictions, and so many
scornes of the world are
cast upon the beautie of a
Christian life: it is hid in
our head Christ. It is not
altogether hid: for there is
a life that comes from the
root, from the head Christ
to the members, that quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
them; but in regard of
the glory that shall be, it is a
hidden life.</p>
            <p>Let us consider the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons<note place="margin">Reasons.</note>
why God will have it
thus (to make it cleare) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:29272:52"/>
I goe further: <hi>We must
be modest in reasons when we
speake of Gods counsels and
courses.</hi> I will onely name
them to open our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
a little.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">1 Reason.</note> 
               <hi>It is enough that
God will have it so:</hi> a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
Christian will be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with that, that God
will have a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
heaven and earth,
Gods dispensation may sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
them. 2. God wil have
a difference betweene the
warring Church, and the
triumphing Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This life is a life of Faith,
and not of sight.</hi> We walke
and live by faith. Why?
partly to try the truth of
our faith, and partly for the
glory of God, that he hath
such servants inn the world
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:29272:52"/>
here, that will depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, upon termes of
faith, upon his bare word,
that can say, there are such
things reserved in heaven
for me, I have enough:
what a glory is it to God,
that he hath those that will
trust him upon his bare
word? It were no commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
for a Christian to
live here in a beautifull
glorious manner, if hee
should see all, and live by
sight. If he should see hell
open, &amp; the terrours there,
for him then to abstraine
from sinne, what glory were
it? the sight would force
abstinence. If he should see
heaven open, and the joyes
of it present, it were no
thanks to be a good man:
for sight would force it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:29272:53"/>
The second Reason is
this,<note place="margin">2 Reason.</note> that God will have a
known difference, between
hypocrites, and the true
Children of God. If heaven
were upon earth, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
reserved in faith, and
in promise, every one would
be a Christian: but now the
greatest things being laid
up in promises, wee must
excercise our faith to waite
for them; now there are
none that will honour God
in his word, but the true
Christian: that there are
such excellent things reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in another world, in
comparison of which all
these are base: there is none
but a true Christian that
will honour God upon his
word, that will venter the
losse of these things here
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:29272:53"/>
for them in heaven, that wil
not lose those things that
they have in reversion and
promise for the present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
of sinne for a season?
Wheras the common sort,
they heare say of a heaven,
and happinesse, and a day
of judgement, &amp;c. But in
the meane time they will
not deny their base plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and their Rebellious
dispositions, they wil crosse
themselves in nothing: doe
wee thinke that God hath
prepared heaven for such
wretches as these? oh, let us
never thinke of it. God
therefore hath reserved the
best excellencies for the
time to come, in promises,
and in his word, if we have
grace to depend upon his
word: and in the meane
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:29272:54"/>
time goe on, and crosse our
corruptions, it is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
condition to be so, it
shewes the difference that
God will have between us,
and other men.<note place="margin">3 Reason.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Againe thirdly, our vessells
could not containe it:</hi> Wee
are uncapable, our braine
is not strong enough for
these things: as weake
braines cannot digest hote
liquors: so we cannot digest
a large revelation of these
things. As wee see St. <hi>Peter</hi>
was not himselfe in the
transfiguration, hee forgot
himselfe; and was spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
drunke with joy, with
that hee saw in the mount;
hee wote not what hee said
as the Scripture saith, when
hee said, <hi>Master let us make
three Tabernacles, &amp;c.</hi> Nay
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:29272:54"/>
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himself, the great
Apostle, when hee saw
things in heaven, above ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
that could not, nor
might not be uttered, could
not digest them. They were
so great, that if he had not
had somewhat to weigh
him downe, to ballance
him, hee had been overtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with pride: therefore
there was a pricke in the
flesh sent to <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe
to humble him. Are wee
greater than <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi>
the great Apostles of the
Jewes and Gentiles? when
these grand Apostles could
not containe themselves,
when they see these hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
things, and but a
glimpse of them, the one
did not know what he said,
and the other was humbled
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:29272:55"/>
by way of prevention, with
a pricke in the flesh; and
shal we think to conceive of
these things? No, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not:
for that is to be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
before our time. These
and the like reasons wee
may have to satisfie us in
this, why wee cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of the things to come
as they are in their proper
nature. God sayth to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
when <hi>Moses</hi> would have
a fairer manifestation of
God, <hi>No man can see me and
live.</hi> If we would see God
as he is, we must die. If we
would see heaven,<note place="margin">If wee would see God as he is, we must die.</note> and the
joyes of it as it is, wee must
die first. No man can see
the things that the Apostle
here speakes of, in their
proper light and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie,
but he must die first.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:29272:55"/>
They are not proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
to our condition
here: for God hath resolved
that this life shall bee a life
of imperfection, and that
that shall be a perfect estate
of perfect glory. Alas, our
capacities now are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
our affections wil not
containe those excellent
things; therefore God
traines us up by little, and
little, to the full fruition,
and enjoying of it. Thus we
see how wee come to have
some knowledge of them,
and why we have not a full
knowledge of them here.</p>
            <p>Well, to leave this, and
goe on;<note place="margin">Use. I.</note> 
               <hi>If this be so, then let
us oft thinke of these things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The life of a Christian is
wondrously ruled in this
world, by the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

and meditation of the
life of another world,<note place="margin">The medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the life hereafter, steeres a Christians life here.</note> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more steeres the life
of a Christian here, then the
consideration of the life
hereafter: not only by way
of comfort, that the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of immortal life, &amp;
glory, is the comfort of this
mortall base life: but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
by way of disposition,
and framing a man to all
courses that are good.
There is no grace of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
(in a manner) but it is
set on worke by the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the estate that is
to come, no not one.</p>
            <p>What is the worke of
faith? <hi>It is the evidence of
things not seene.</hi> It sets the
things of another world
present before the eye of
the soule, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:29272:56"/>
it is victorious, it
conquers the world; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it sets a better world
in the eye. Where were the
exercise of faith, if it were
not for hope of such an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
which feeds faith? the
excellencie of faith is, that
it is about things not seene:
it makes things that are not
seene to be seene; it hath a
kind of omnipotent power:
it gives a being to things
that have none, but in the
promise of the speaker.</p>
            <p>And for hope, <hi>the very
nature of hope is to expect
those things that faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves.</hi>
Were it not for the
joyes of heaven, where
were hope? It is the helmet
of the soule, to keepe it
from blowes, and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
It is the Anchor of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:29272:57"/>
the soule, that being cast
within the vaile into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
stayes the soule in all
the waves and troubles in
this world: the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the things to come,
exerciseth this grace of
hope; we looke within the
vaile, and cast anchor there
upward, and not downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and there wee stay
our selves in all combusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and confusions by the
exercise of hope.</p>
            <p>And where were pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?
If it were not for a
better estate in another
world, a <hi>Christian of all men
were most miserable.</hi> Who
would endure any thing
for Christ, if it were not
for a better estate after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards?</p>
            <p>And so for sobrietie;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:29272:57"/>
what forceth a moderate
use of all things here? the
consideration of future
judgement, that made even
<hi>Felix</hi> to tremble. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the estate to
come, causes that we surfet
not with the cares of the
world, and excesse, but doe
all that may make way for
such a glorious condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>What enforceth the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of a good conscience
in all things? St. <hi>Paul</hi> loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to the resurrection of
the just and of the unjust;
and this made him exercise
himselfe to keepe a good
conscience.</p>
            <p>And so puritie and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that we take heed of
all defilements in the
world, that we <hi>bee not led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:29272:58"/>
with the errour of the
wicked:</hi> but <hi>keepe our selves
unspotted.</hi> What forceth
this, but the consideration
of a glorious condition in
another world? <hi>He that hath
this hope, purgeth himselfe.</hi>
There is a purgative power
in hope, a cleansing effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
that a man cannot hope
for this excellent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but it will frame and fit
the soule for that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Can a man hope to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
before a great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and not fit himselfe in
his deportment and attire
before hand, to please the
person before whom hee
appeares? So whosoever
hopes to appeare before
Christ, and God, of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
that hope will force
him to purge himselfe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:29272:58"/>
Let us not stand to search
curiously into particulars,
what the glory of the soule
or of the body shall bee,
(the Apostle discovers it in
generall, we shall bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
to Christ our head
in soule and body) but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
study how to make
good use of them: for
therefore they are revealed
before hand in generall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And with all to humble our
selves,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Vse.</note> 
               <hi>and to say with the
Psalmist, Lord what is Man,
that thon so farre considerest
him?</hi> Sinfull man, that hath
lost his first condition, and
hath betrayed himselfe to
thine, and his enemy, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
him to that estate,
<hi>that neither eye hath seene,
nor eare heard, &amp;c.</hi> This
consideration will make
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:29272:59"/>
us base in our owne eyes.</p>
            <p>Shall not wee presently
disdaine any proud con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits?
shall wee talke of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit?
what can come from a
Creature that shall deserve
things that eie hath not seen
nor eare heard; that such
proud conceits should enter
into the heart of man? sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grace never entred into
that mans heart that hath
such a conceite to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
merit. Shall a man
thinke by a penny to merit
a thousand pound, by a
little performance to merit
things that are above the
conceit of men and Angels?
but a word is enough that
way.</p>
            <p>And <hi>with humiliation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3 Vse.</note>
               <hi>take that which alwayes goes
with humiliation, thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:29272:59"/>
even before hand.</hi>
When the Apostle S. <hi>Peter</hi>
thought of the <hi>inheritance
immortall, and undefiled, &amp;c.</hi>
he begins, <hi>Blessed be God, the
Father of our Lord Iesus
Christ, &amp;c.</hi> Hee could not
think of these things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thankfulnesse to God.
For wee should begin the
life of heaven, upon earth,
as much as may bee; and
what is that, but a blessing
and praising of God? Now
we cannot more effectually
and feelingly praise God,
than by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration of
what great things are reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for us: for faith sets
them before the soule as
present, as invested into
them. Now if we were in
heaven already, we: should
praise God, and do nothing
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:29272:60"/>
else; therfore faith making
them sure to the soule, as
if we had them, sets the
soule on worke to praise
God, as in <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. and in
<hi>Pet.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 1 Pet. 1.</note> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi>
they could never have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of this. Thus wee
should doe, and cheare and
joy our hearts in the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of these things in
all conflicts, &amp; desolations:
wee little thinke of these
things, and that is our fault:
wee are like little children
that are born to great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
notwithstanding not
knowing of them, they
carry not themselves an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to their hopes:
but the more the children
grow into yeares, the more
they grow in spirit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
and carriage sitting
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:29272:60"/>
the estates they hope
for.</p>
            <p>So it is with Christians at
the first, when they are
weake, they are troubled
with this temptation, and
with that, with this losse,
and with that crosse: but
when a Christian growes to
a full stature in Christ, every
petty crosse doth not cast
him downe: hee thinkes,
what shall I be dejected
with this losse, that have
heaven reserved for mee?
shall I bee cast downe with
this crosse, that have things
<hi>that eye hath not seene, nor
eare heard, &amp;c.</hi> Prepared for
me? He will not; he makes
use of his faith to fetch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
from these things that
are reserved for him,<note place="margin">Every pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty crosse will not cast downe a believer.</note> that

            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:29272:61"/>
               <hi>And let us comfort our

               <note place="margin">4 Vse.</note> A man that hath

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
if he be slighted abroad,
he thinkes with himselfe, I
have other matters reserved
elsewhere, and I shall have
another manner of respect
when I come home. The
world it knowes not God,
nor Christ, nor us: shall not
we be content to go up and

here, when God the father,
and Christ our Saviour are
unknowne?<note place="margin">Hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with his hopes of heaven, against the slightings of the world.</note> There are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
things reserved at home
for us: therfore let us digest
all the slightings and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of carnal men. And let
us not envy them their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
that is but for terme
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:29272:61"/>
of life, use it as well as they
will; that hath a date that
will bee out wee know not
how soone? Alas all their
happinesse it is but a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
happinesse, it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their understandings,
their eyes can see it, and
their eares can heare it: and
when they can neither see
nor conceive more in this
world, then there is an end
of all their sensible happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Shall we envie when
they shall shortly be turned
naked out of this world to
the place of torment?<note place="margin">Envie not wicked men, but pitty them</note> We
should present them to us
as objects of pitie, even the
greatest men in the world,
if wee see by their carriage
they be void of grace; but
not envy any condition in
this world. But what affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:29272:62"/>
is due and suiting to the
estate of a Christian? If we
would have the true affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it is admiration, and
wonderment. <hi>What is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derment?
It is the state, and
disposition of the soule toward
things that are new, and rare,
and strange, that we can give
no reason of, that are beyond
our reach.</hi> For wise men
wonder not, because they
see a reason, they can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
things: But a Christian
cannot but wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der: because
the things prepared, are
above his reach: yea when
he is in heaven, he shall not
be able to conceive the
glory of it: he shall enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, it shall bee above him,
he shall have more joy, and
peace then he can compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
the joy that hee hath
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:29272:62"/>
there, it is beyond his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and capacity, beyond his
power; he shall not be able
to compasse all. It shall be a
matter of wonder, even in
heaven it selfe; much more
should it bee here below.
Therefore the holy Apostles
when they speake in the
Scriptures of these things, it
is with termes of admiration
and wonderment,<note place="margin">joy unspe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable
&amp; glorious, &amp; peace
that passeth understanding,</hi> &amp;
when they speake of our
deliverance, out of the state
of darknesse into the state
of grace, they call it <hi>a being
brought out of darknesse into
his mervailous light.</hi> And <hi>so
God loved the world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3.</note> he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

Behold what love hath the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Begge of God first, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of grace to conceive of
them as the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals
them: and then begge
of God a further degree of
revelation, that hee would
more and more reveale to
us by his Spirit those excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
things. For the soule is
never in a better frame,
than when it is lift up above
earthly things. When shall
a man use the world, as
though hee used it not?
when he goes about his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
in a commanding
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:29272:63"/>
manner, as seeing all things
under him,<note place="margin">Why men are drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the world.</note> when he is ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

drowned in the world: what
makes men drowned in the
world? to be earth-wormes:
they think of no other hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
but this, they have no
other thing in their eye.
Now by the Spirit discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
these things to the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
that have weaned soules, it
makes them goe about the
things of the world in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

them, and doe them exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
with conscience, and
care, considering that they
must give an account of all:
but they wil doe them with
reserved affections to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:29272:64"/>
thing. Therefore let us
oft thinke of this, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to have a spirit of faith
to believe them, that they
are so, that there are such
great things; and then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
believing, the meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of such excellent things
will keepe the soule in such
a frame, as it will bee fit for
any thing without defiling
of it selfe. A man that hath
first faith, that these things
are so: and then that hath
faith exercised to thinke,
and meditate what these
things are,<note place="margin">How to get the conquest of any tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> he may bee tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

to any base sin, what
will he thinke? shall I
for the pleasures of sin
for a season, if not lose the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:29272:64"/>
joyes of heaven and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that <hi>eye hath not seene,
&amp;c.</hi> yet surely I shall lose
the comfort and assurance
of them. A man cannot
enjoy the comfort of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon earth, without
self-deniall, and mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
shall I lose peace of
conscience, and joy in the
holy Ghost for these things?
When Sathan comes with
any bait, let us thinke hee
comes to rob us of better
than he can give: his bait is
some present pleasure, or
preferment, or contentment
here; but what doth he take
from us? that which <hi>eye
hath not seene, nor eare heard,
&amp;c.</hi> Hee gives <hi>Adam</hi> an
Apple, and takes away Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise:
therefore in all
temptations consider not
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:29272:65"/>
what he offers, but what we
shall lose; at least the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of what we shall lose;
we shall lose the comfort of
heaven, and bring our
selves to terrours of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
            <p>Religion is not so empty
a thing, as that wee need to
be beholding to the Divell
for any preferment, or ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
or contentment, or
pleasure. Hath God set up
a profession of Religion,
and doe wee thinke that we
must bee beholding to his,
and our enemy for any base
contentments? No; it is a
disparagment to our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to our profession and
calling, and to our Lord and
Master we serve, to thinke
that hee will not provide
richly for his: you see here
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:29272:65"/>
he hath prepared things
that <hi>eye hath not seene, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by this likwise wee
may judge of the difference
of excellencies, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of degrees of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
may bee fetched
from hence. The things
that the eye can see, they
may be excellent good
things; but if the eye can
see them, there is no great
matters in them. The thing
that the eare heares by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
are more than the eye
sees; wee may heare much
that we never saw: yet if
we can heare them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of them upon the
hearing, they are no great
matters: for the soule is lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than they. We conceive
more than wee can heare;
the conceit is beyond sight,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:29272:66"/>
and hearing, if we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the compasse, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of any thing it is no
great matter: for it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the reach, and module,
and apprehension of mans
braine, it is no wondrous
matter. I but then the things
that are most excellent of
all, they are above sight, and
beholding, and hearing: and
conceite, that the soule can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
wholly compasse, and
reach them, those are the
excellent things of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l. The
rule of excellencie is to
know what wee can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
and what is beyond
our comprehension: The
wit of man can conceive all
things under the heavens.
All the knowledge we have
comes within the braine of
man, the government of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:29272:66"/>
states, and the like. Oh!
but the things that God
hath provided for his, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
came wholly within the
braine of man; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.</p>
            <p>And so by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries
for ills, what are the
greatest ills? those that the
eye can see, that wee can
feele, and heare of, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive?
Oh! no, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
ills are those torments
that never eye saw, that eare
never heard of, it is to be in
hell to know these things;
they are beyond our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
<hi>the worme that dies not,
fire unquenchable,</hi> the things
above our apprehension
are the most terrible things.
It is not the gout, or the
stone; men feel these things,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:29272:67"/>
and yet suffer them with
some patience: these are
not the greatest ills, but
those of another world that
are reserved for Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
as the best things are
those that are reserved for
his friends.</p>
            <p>Therefore let us make
use of our understandings
in laying things together,
and make use of Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the state of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie,
the excellencies of
religion. Why doth God
reveale these things in the
word? that wee should oft
meditate of them, and study
them, that we may bee hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
minded: for there
are none that come to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but they must have a
taste of these before hand;
there are none ever enjoy
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:29272:67"/>
them in perfection; when
the day of revelation shall
come (the Gospell now is
the time of revelation, but)
the day of revelation is the
time of judgement, then we
shall wee be revealed what
we are. But in the meane
time there is a revelation by
the spirit in some begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of these things, or else
we shall never come to have
the perfection of them in
heaven. If wee know not
what peace, and joy, and
comfort, and the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Saints, and the
change of nature is here in
sanctification, wee shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
know in heaven the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of it.</p>
            <p>And those that have the
first fruits here, if they bee
in a state of growth, that
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:29272:68"/>
they desire to grow better
continually, they shall no
question come to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
for God will not lose
his beginnings: where hee
gives earnest, he will make
up the bargaine.</p>
            <p>Therefore let us all that
know a little what these
things are by the revelation
of the Spirit, let us be glad
of our portion: for God
that hath begun, hee will
surely make an end.</p>
            <p>The affection, and bent,
and frame of soule due to
these things is admiration,
and not only simple hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
If these things in their
beginnings here, be set out
by words of admiration,
peace that passeth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and joy unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and glorious: what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:29272:68"/>
and frame of Spirit
is sutable to the hearing of
those things that are kept
for us in another world? If
the light that wee are
brought into here bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable,
great, wee are
brought out of darknesse,
into admirable wonderfull
light: If the light of grace
bee so wonderfull to a man
that comes out of the state
of Nature, as it is indeed; a
man comes out of a dampe
into a wonderfull cleare
light; what then is the light
of glory? Therefore let us
often think of it. Those that
are borne in a prison, they
heare great talke of the
light, and of the Sunne, of
such a glorious Creature;
but being borne in prison
they know not what it is in
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:29272:69"/>
it selfe: so those that are in
the prison of Nature, they
know not what the light of
grace is: they heare talke
of glorious things, and have
conceits of them. And those
that here know not the
glory that shall bee after,
when they are revealed,
that affection that is due to
them is admiration and
wonderment. So God loved
the world, that he gave his
only begotten Sonne; and
behold what love the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath shewed to us, that
wee should bee called the
sonnes of God! what love!
he could not tell what, it is
so admirable, and to know
the love of God that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all knowledge! Who
can comprehend the love
of God, that gave his sonne?
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:29272:69"/>
who can comprehend the
excellency of Christs gift?
the joyes of heaven by
Christ, and the misery of
hell, from which wee are
delivered, and redeemed by
Christ? These things come
from the Gospell, and the
spring from whence they
come, is the large, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
and incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
love of God. And if it
bee so, what affection is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
but admiration?
Behold what love! If God
have so loved flesh, and
blood, poore dust &amp; ashes;
so as to be heires of heaven,
and of such glory as eye
seesnot, nor cannot in this
world, nor eare heares not,
nor hath entred into the
heart of man, till we come
fully to possesse them; let
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:29272:70"/>
us labour to admire the
love of God herein.</p>
            <p>And labour to know
more and more our inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
as we grow in yeares,
as children doe, they search
into the great matters their
parents leave them, and the
nearer they come to enjoy
them, the more skill they
have to talke of them: so
should wee, the more wee
grow in Christianity, and
in knowledge, the more we
should bee inquisitive after
those great things that our
father hath provided in
another world: but to goe
on.</p>
            <p>How shall we know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
these things be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for us or no? whether
wee bee capable of these
things or no? God hath
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:29272:70"/>
prepared them, and he hath
prepared them for those
that love him; but how
shall wee know that God
hath prepared them for
us?</p>
            <p>In a word, whom God
hath prepared great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
for, hee prepares them
for great matters: we may
know by Gods preparing
of us, whether he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for us. God prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Paradise before <hi>Adam</hi>
was created: so God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
paradise, he prepares
heaven before wee come
there; and wee may know
that wee shall come to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse
that, if we be prepared
for it. What preparation?
If we be prepared by a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of sanctification; and
have holy desires, and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:29272:71"/>
after those excellent
things: for certainly there
is preparation on both
sides. It is prepared for us,
and us for it; it is kept for
us, and wee are kept for it:
whom God keepes heaven
for, he keeps them for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in a course of pietie and
obedience. We may know
it by Gods preparing of us,
by loosing us from the
world, and sanctifying us to
himselfe. Thus a man may
know whether those great
things bee prepared for
him, or no.</p>
            <p>But the especiall thing
to know whether they be
provided for us, or no, is
love. <hi>God hath prepared them
for them that love him:</hi> not
for his enemies: hee hath
prepared another place,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:29272:71"/>
and other things for them,
those torments that <hi>eye hath
not seene, nor eare heard, nor
hath entred into the heart of
man,</hi> for those that are his
enemies, that would not
come under his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
but these things are
prepared <hi>for those that love
him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For those that love him:
especially that love is all in
all, in the disposition of a
holy man: all graces are one
in the spring, which is love:
they are severall in the
branches, but they are one
in the root.</p>
            <p>Thus you have heard the
use we are to make of this,
that there is a reservation
of a glorious condition for
the people of GOD, so
great, that neither <hi>eye hath
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:29272:72"/>
seene, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But who bee the parties,
that God hath prepared
these things for?</p>
            <p>For them that love him.</p>
            <p>This is the fourth part,<note place="margin">The fourth particular.</note>
the disposition of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

No, that is out of
our reach; hee would not

rather goe to our owne
hearts; wee must search f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

aske him if hee love
God; Oh, yes, he loves the
preaching of the word, hee
loves good people, and
good bookes, and the like:
when hee cannot discover
his faith, hee can his love;
therefore the holy Ghost
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:29272:73"/>
sets it out by the more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
disposition, by love,
rather than faith.</p>
            <p>Why doth hee not say,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> For
those that God loves? Gods
love is the cause of our love.</p>
            <p>Because Gods love is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
more familiarly by
our love to him:<note place="margin">Answ.</note> for that
is alwaies supposed; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
there is love to God,
and good things, there is
Gods love first. For our love
to God is but a reflexion of
that love hee beares to us:
First, hee shines on us, and
then the beames of our
love reflect upon him;
therefore hee need not say,
whom God loves (though
that be the cause of all) but
who love God, and know
thereby that hee loves
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:29272:73"/>
But why for them that love
him,<note place="margin">4 Quest.</note> more than for any other
thing?</p>
            <p>Because all can love,<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
therefore hee sets downe
this affection: there is no
man living, not the poorest
<hi>Lazar</hi> in the world, that
hath a heart, and affections,
but he can love. He doth
not say, that are prepared
for this great Christian, and
that learned <hi>Rabbi;</hi> no,<note place="margin">For whom these are prepared.</note> but
for all that love him, bee
they poore or rich, great or
small, all those that love
him. Therefore hee sets
down that to cut off all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses:
yea, and all that love
him, bee they never so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
are sure to have these
great things prepared for
them. God hath prepared
<hi>these things for those that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:29272:74"/>
love him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To come therefore to
some observations. The first
generall thing is this, that</p>
            <p>God d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The cause of it is his free
love: but if you aske mee
what qualification the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
must have? They are
such as <hi>love him. This is
not the proper cause why, but
t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hom these things are.</hi>
There must bee an inward
disposition and qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
before wee come to

            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:29272:74"/>
Why?</p>
            <p>The Scripture is plaine,<note place="margin">R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ke God is merciful, and
Christ died, &amp;c. but neither
such, nor such as you are,
(and your consciences tell
you so) shall ever enter into
heaven. We must not think
to come <hi>è coeno in coelum,</hi>
out of the mire and dirt of
sin, into heaven: there is no
such sudden getting into
heaven;<note place="margin">No gett<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

an alteration of our dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
wrought by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, fitting us for
heaven.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Another is that that I
touched before, that</hi> heaven
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:29272:75"/>
and earth differ but in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees:
therefore what is there
in perfection, must be begun
here.</p>
            <p>Then againe thirdly, <hi>It
is impossible for a man if he be
not truly altered, to desire or
wish heaven as it is holy.</hi> He
may wish for it under the
notion of a Kingdome, of
pleasure, and the like: but
as heaven containes a state
of perfect holinesse, and
freedome from sinne, hee
cares not for it. A man
that is out of relish with
heavenly things, and can
taste onely his base sinnes,
whereon his affections are
set and exercised, cannot
rellish heaven it selfe. A
common base sinner, his
desires are not there. There
must bee some proportion
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:29272:75"/>
between the thing desired,
and the desire; but here is
none, hee is not fit for that
place, being an unholy
wretch.</p>
            <p>Therefore his own heart
tells him, I had rather have
this pleasure and honour
that my heart stands to,
than to have heaven, while
hee is in that frame of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire:
therefore there is no
man that can desire hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
that is not disposed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
to heaven before.
Beetles love dunghils bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than oyntments, and
swine love mud better than
a garden; they are in their
element in these things: so

then in creation, hee prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
the blessed place of
the happy soules of happy
persons hereafter, where
he himselfe is; he prepared
it for himselfe, and for all
those that he meanes to set
his love upon from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to the end.</p>
            <p>And then secondly, hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
prepared them more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
in time, he prepared
these things when Christ
came in the flesh, and
wrought all things for us,
in whom we have all. Of
these things thus prepared,
he sayth, <hi>Eye hath not seene,
nor eare heard them, &amp;c.</hi> In
what sence it is meant, wee
heard before. Now take
the whole of the matter, the
meaning is, <hi>the matters of
grace, the kingdome of grace,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:29272:81"/>
and the Kingdome of Glory,</hi>
they are but one. For (to
adde this by the way) the
kingdome of heaven in the
Gospell, includes three
thing.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, the doctrine of the
Gospell, the publishing of
it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And then secondly, grace
by that doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And thirdly, glory upon
grace, the consummation of
all.</p>
            <p>So the mysteries of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
is first the doctrine
it selfe, that is the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of the kingdome. The
doctrine it selfe is a mysterie
to all those that never
heard of it: for what crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
could ever conceive
how to reconcile <hi>Iustiee</hi> and
<hi>Mercie,</hi> by devising such a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:29272:81"/>
way, as for God to become
Man, to reconcile God and
man together? that <hi>Emma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi>
hee that is <hi>God with us,</hi>
should make God and us
one in love: this could bee
no more thought of, than
<hi>Adam</hi> could thinke of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to bee made a man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
when hee was dust of the
earth. Could man when
he was worse then dust, in
a lost damned estate, think
of redemption? It is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for a man that cannot
tell the forme, and the
quintessence, that cannot
enter into the depth of the
flowers, or the grasse that
hee tramples on with his
feet, that hee should have
the wit to enter into the
deepe things of God, that
have been concealed even
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:29272:82"/>
from the Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
till God discover
them. I adde this, to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
what I sayd before:
therefore the doctrine it
selfe, till God discover it
out of his owne breast, was
concealed to the Angels
themselves; and since the
discovery, they are students
in it, and looke and pry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it. But where the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is no mysterie, but is
discovered: there the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
and spirituall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
to those that
have not the light of the
Spirit, is such a thing, as <hi>eye
hath not seene, nor eare heard;</hi>
and therfore we must have
a new light, a new eye, a
new eare, and a new heart,
before wee can apprehend
the Gospell, though we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:29272:82"/>
it for the literall
truth. As for the things of
glory, wee have no conceit
of them fully, but by a
glimpse, and weak appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension;
as a childe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
of the things of a
man, by some poore, weake
resemblances. As St. <hi>Paul</hi>
sayth, <hi>When I was a childe, I
spake as a childe, I thought as a
childe:</hi> so when we are now
children, in comparison of
that perfect estate wee shall
attaine in heaven, we think
and speake as children, of
these holy and heavenly
things that shall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
in another world.</p>
            <p>And observe this too,
that <hi>when wee would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
any thing of heaven, and
see any thing, say, This is not
that happinesse I look for, I can
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:29272:83"/>
see this,</hi> but that is not to be
seene. And when we heare
of any thing that is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
I can heare this, it is
not my happinesse: and
when we comprehend any
thing, I can comprehend
this, therefore it is not the
happinesse I looke for: but
those things that are above
my comprehension, that are
unutterable, and unexpres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
            <p>Moreover, <hi>Let us bee stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up to thinke it a base thing
for a Christian to lose the
comfort and assurance hee hath
of these thing: that eye hath
not seene, nor eare heard, for
any earthly thing whatsoever.</hi>
Wee account it a poore
thing of <hi>Esau,</hi> to sell his
Birth-right for a messe of
pottage. And we all smart
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:29272:83"/>
for <hi>Adams</hi> ill bargaine that
hee made, to sell paradise
for an Apple. And it was a
cursed sale that <hi>Iudas</hi> made,
that sold Christ himselfe
for 30 pieces of silver: sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it is that that every car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
man doth, and howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
wee cannot lose hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
yet it should be our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to enjoy heaven
upon earth, to enjoy the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of this condition.
When we doe any thing to
weaken our assurance, and
to weaken our comfort,
what do we but with <hi>Adam</hi>
lose heaven for an Apple,
and with <hi>Esau,</hi> part with
our birth-right, as much as
the assurance, and comfort
of it is, for a messe of pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage?
Therefore let us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it a base thing to bee
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:29272:84"/>
overmuch in love with any
earthly thing,<note place="margin">It is a base thing to be too much in love with any earthly thing.</note> whereby we
may weaken, though wee
could lose the comfort, and
assurance of this happy
condition, which is so tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent.
All wicked men,
and indeed all men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good or bad, as farre
as they fall into sinne, are
fooles; the Scripture termes
them so. There is none
wise indeed but the true
Christian, and that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
that preserves the sence
and feeling, and assurance
of his happy condition.</p>
            <p>For those that love him.</p>
            <p>The disposition of the
parties is, they are such as
<hi>love God.</hi> He sayth not, such
as are elected, because that
is a thing out of our reach
to know; but by going up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:29272:84"/>
by going backward,
to goe from our grace to
our calling; &amp; from thence,
to election. Nor such as
believe, because that is lesse
discernable than love. Nor
the love of God to us: for
that is supposed when wee
love him; our hearts being
cold, they cannot be warme
in love to him, but his love
must warme them first.
Love is such an affection as
commands all other things,
therefore hee names that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all. And love is such
a thing as every one may
try himself by:<note place="margin">Try thy selfe by thy love.</note> if he had na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
either giving, or doing
of this or that, men might
have sayd, I cannot doe it,
or I cannot part with it; but
when he names love, there
is none but they may love.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:29272:85"/>
The poynt considered was,
that</p>
            <p>There must be a qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of those that heaven is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for.</p>
            <p>They must bee such as
love God, such as are alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and changed, and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
to love him; Because
no uncleane thing shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in thither; Because wee
cannot so much as desire
heaven without a change;
we cannot have communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
there with Christ, and
those blessed soules, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
likenesse to them,
which must be by a spirit of
love: our natures must bee
altered: Therefore it is a
vaine presumption for any
man to thinke of heaven,
unlesse he finde his disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
altered. For <hi>wee may
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:29272:85"/>
read our eternall condition in
heaven,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Wee may know hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to bee ours by the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of our hearts. 1 Pet. 1.</note> 
               <hi>by our disposition up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
earth.</hi> The Apostle <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
sayth, 1 Pet. 1. <hi>Blessed bee
God, the Father of our Lord
Iesus Christ, that hath begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
us to a lively hope of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
immortall, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

that the inheritance in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
wee are begotten to it,
wee must be new borne, we
must have a new birth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee can inherit it, <hi>hee
hath begotten us to an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
immortall, &amp;c. Hee
that is not a childe, may not
thinke of an inheritance.</hi> Put
case there bee never so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
glorious things in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
that <hi>eye hath never seene,
nor eare ever heard, &amp;c.</hi> if
our names be not in Christs
will, that we are not his, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:29272:86"/>
prove our selves to be his,
by the alteration of our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
what are all those
good things to us, when
our names are not contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
there?</p>
            <p>It is called <hi>a hope of life, a
lively hope;</hi> because hee that
hath this <hi>hope, purgeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,</hi>
it makes him vigorous
and active in good: if his
hope of life make him not
lively, he hath no hope of
life at all. Therefore those
that will looke for heaven,
that Sathan abuse them not
by false confidence, let
them looke whether God
have altered their hearts,
that the worke of grace be
wrought in some measure.
For God hath not ordained
these great things for his
enemies, for blasphemers,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:29272:86"/>
that take Gods name in
vaine,<note place="margin">God hath not ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for his enemies.</note> that run on in courses
contrary to his will, and
word, that live in sinnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the light of nature;
do you thinke he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
these great matters
for them? he hath another
place for them. Therefore
let us not be abused by our
owne false hearts, to thinke
of such a happy condition:
unlesse we finde our selves
changed, unlesse we be new
borne, we shall never enter
into heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> say they, Christ
brings them in pleading so,
<hi>Lord, Lord;</hi> not that they
shall say so then, that is not
the meaning: but now they
cherish such a confidence;
Oh, we can speake well, and
we can pray wel, <hi>Lord, Lord.</hi>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:29272:87"/>
Oh, thou vaine confident
person, thy confession, and
profession, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> shall
doe thee no good. I will
not so much as owne thee,
<hi>Away hence thou worker of
iniquitie,</hi> thy heart tels thee,
thou livest in sinnes against
conscience; away, avaunt, I
will none of thee. God in
mercie to us will have the
triall of the truth of our
evidence in us. The ground
of all our salvation is his
grace, his free favour, and
mercie, in his owne heart;
but we cannot goe thither,
he would have us to search
within our selves, and there
we shall finde <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>—God hath prepared for
those that love him.<note place="margin">Observ.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In particular therefore,
<hi>Those that God hath provided
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:29272:87"/>
so excellent things for, they are
such as love him.</hi> They are
such first of all that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
of him; and shew
that they are beloved of
him, by their love to him.
Therefore when the Papists
meet with such phrases,
they think of merit:<note place="margin">Merit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</note> he hath
provided heaven for them
that love him, and shew
their love in good workes.
But we must know, that this
is not brought in as a cause
why, but as a qualification
of the persons who; who
shall inherit heaven, and
who shall have these great
things? It is idle for them
to thinke, that these things
are prepared for those,
whom God foresees would
doe such and such good
workes: it is as if we should
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:29272:88"/>
thinke hee hath provided
these happy things for
those that are his enemies.
For how could he look for
love from us in a state of
corruption, when the best
thing in us was enmitie to
him? Is it not a vaine
thing to looke for light
from darknesse? to look for
love from enmity and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred?
therefore how could
God foresee any thing in
us, when he could see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but enmity and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in our dispositions by
nature?</p>
            <p>And then (as we shall see
afterward) this love in us,
it must bee with all our
heart, and soule, and might,
it is required and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
and when wee doe all
this, wee doe but what wee
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:29272:88"/>
are bound to doe. But they
abuse such places upon so
shallow ground, that indeed
it deserves not so much as
to be mentioned.</p>
            <p>To come then to the
poynt it selfe, the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those that shal come
to heaven then, is, they must
be such as love God. Now
hee names this, because
these two goe alwayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
there goes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of ours together with
somewhat of Gods to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to us what God doth.
There goes our choyce of
God, with his chusing of us;
our knowing of God, with
his knowledge of us; our
love to him, with his love
to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore because
these are so connexed, and
knit together, hee takes the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:29272:89"/>
one for the other; and to
make it familiar to us, hee
takes that which is most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
to us, our love to him.</p>
            <p>Now hee names this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all other affections;
because love is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
affection of the
soule,<note place="margin">Love a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> it is that affection
that rules all other affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
hatred, and anger, and
joy, and delight, and desire;
they all spring from love:
&amp; because all duties spring
from love both to God and
man, therefore both Tables
are included in love. And
when the Apostle would
set downe the qualification
of those that shall enjoy
these things, he sayth, they
are for <hi>those that love him.</hi>
Because it stirres up to all
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:29272:89"/>
dutie, and addes a sweet
qualification to every duty,
and makes it acceptable,
and to rellish with God; it
stirres up to doe, and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the actions that come
from love, to bee accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>All duties to man, spring
from love to man; and love
to man from love to God:
it is the affection that stirres
up the dutie, and stirres up
the affection fit for the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
it stirres up to doe the
thing, and to do all in love.
Whatsoever wee doe to
God, or man, it must bee in
love; all that God doth to
us, it is in love, hee chuseth
us in love, and doth every
thing in love; and all that
wee doe to God, it must be
in love. Therfore he names
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:29272:90"/>
no other affection but this,
because it is the ground, the
first borne affection of the
soule: Therefore Christ
sayth, it is <hi>the great comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
to love God;</hi> it is the
great commanding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
all other duties
whatsoever, it is the first
wheele that turnes the
whole soule about.</p>
            <p>Againe, it is such an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
as cannot bee dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled:
a man may paint fire,
but hee cannot paint heat;
a man may dissemble acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in religion, but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
affections: love is
the very best affection of
truth: a man may counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
actions; but there is
none that can love but the
childe of God. <hi>God hath
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:29272:90"/>
prepared these things for those
that love him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then againe, without
this, all that we doe is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and wee are nothing:
wee are nothing but an
emptie Cymball: whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
we doe is nothing; all is
emptie without love. <hi>My
sonne, give me thy heart,</hi> that
is, if thou wilt give mee any
thing, give mee thy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or else they are still<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne
actions,<note place="margin">Our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are but still<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

life in them. If wee doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing to God, and doe it
not in love, hee regards it
not; that is the reason why
hee mentions love in stead
of all: It is so sweet an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and so easie, what is
more easie than to love? It
is comfortable to us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that God hath made
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:29272:91"/>
this a qualification of those
that hee brings to heaven,
<hi>they are such as love him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why doth he set down
any qualification at all, and
not say, for <hi>Christians?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Because profession must
have expression: when God
sets down a professor of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
hee sets him downe
by some character that shall
discover him to be as hee is
termed. How doest tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
know thou art good? Doest
thou love God? or call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God? as it is in other
places, <hi>To all those that call
upon his name.</hi> To let us
know that religion and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
is a matter of power,
Wouldst thou know what
thou art in religion? Doest
thou love God? or call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:29272:91"/>
It is not to be tolerated,
to be Christians, to professe
as <hi>Demas:</hi> oh no; but they
must bee such, as from the
heart root are good, <hi>such as
love God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore darke dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
of election &amp; prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination,
at the first especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
let them go: how stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
thou affected to God,
and to good things? look to
thy heart, whether <hi>God</hi> have
taught it to love or no, and
to relish heavenly things:
if he hath, thy state is
good; and then thou mayest
ascend to those great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of predestination, and
election: but begin not with
those, but goe first to thine
owne heart, and then to
those deep mysteries after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
If a man love God,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:29272:92"/>
hee may looke back to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and forward to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification,
to the things that
<hi>eye hath not seene, nor eare
heard, &amp;c.</hi> But see first what
God hath wrought in thy
heart, what affection to
heavenly things; &amp; thence
from thy affections to goe
backward to election, and
forward to glorification,
there is no danger in it.</p>
            <p>To come therfore to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
more particularly
this affection of love, which
is the disposition that God
requires and workes in all
those that hee intends hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to. Let us search into
the nature of this love to
God. What it is to love,
we need not bee taught, for
all men know it well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
it is better knowne
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:29272:92"/>
indeed by the affection,
than by discourse; what it is
to love, is knowne by those
that love, better than by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
books or treatises what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever:
for it is the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that is in all men. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
love, it is in those
that have no grace at all;
and civill love, in those that
are evill men. They know
what it is to love, by reason
of that wilde fire, that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
love that is in them,
that transports them. A
man may see the nature of
it in those, as well as in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
for set aside the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
nature of it, in such
kinde of persons, we may
see the nature of it: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I wil not meddle with
that poynt, it is needlesse.
I come therefore to this
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:29272:93"/>
love of God, to shew how
this streame of affection
shold be caried in the right
chanel to God the right ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of it, <hi>who onely can make
us happy by loving of him.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things by loving of
them, they make us worse, if
they bee worse than our
selves: for such as we love,
such we are. Indeed our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
make us not
good or ill, but our love
doth. By loving God, &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
things, wee become
good: our affections shew
what we are in religion.</p>
            <p>There bee foure things in
this sweet affection, in true
naturall love.</p>
            <p>There is an estimation &amp;
valuing of some good thing,
especially when the love is
to a better, when it is not
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:29272:93"/>
between equals. Now there
is a great distance betweene
God and us. There is a high
esteeme in common love,
love will not stoope to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
there cannot be love
maintained, but upon sight
of a supposed excellencie:
love will not stoope, but
where it sees somewhat
worth the valuing: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is a high esteeme
of somewhat as the spring
of it. And that is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that wee say a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee wise, and love, in
earthly things: because
love will make a man too
much to value those things
that hee that apprehends
better would not.</p>
            <p>In the second place, there
is a desire to be joyned to it,
that we cal <hi>the desire of union</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:29272:94"/>
In the third place, upon
union, and joyning to it,
there is a resting, a compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie,
and contentment in
the thing to which wee are
united: for what is happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
it selfe, but fully to
enjoy what we love? when
we love upon judgement,
and a right esteeme, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,
that is happinesse, and
contentment indeed.</p>
            <p>In the fourth place, where
this true affection is, there
is a desire of contentment
to the party loved, to please
him, to approve our selves
to him, to displease him in
nothing. Every one knowes
that these things are in that
affection by nature.</p>
            <p>Look to carnal self-love,
a man may know what it is
to love: the affection is all
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:29272:94"/>
one in both. Take a man
when hee makes himselfe
his Idoll, as till a man love
God, hee loves himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all, hee is the Idoll,
and the Idolater: hee hath
a high esteeme of himselfe;
and those that doe not
highly esteeme him, hee
swels against them. Againe
selfe-love makes a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to enjoy himselfe, and
to enjoy his content, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
all things that may
serve for his contentment.</p>
            <p>Now when the Spirit of
God hath purged our
hearts of this carnall Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of selfe-love, and selfe-seeking,
and sufficiencie, &amp;
contentment; in himselfe;
then a man puts God in
stead of himselfe, grace,
and the Spirit doth so; and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:29272:95"/>
in stead of highly estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of himselfe,<note place="margin">When a man puts God in stead of himselfe.</note> hee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemes
highly of GOD, and
of CHRIST, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
then in stead of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
a sufficiencie in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and the things of this
life, and resting in them,
there is a placing of suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie
in GOD All-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient:
And in stead of
seeking his owne will,
and content in all things.
<hi>Mens mihi pro regno.</hi> My
minde is to mee a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
then a man seeks to
give contentment to GOD
in all things, and to bee a
foole, that hee may be wise;
and to have no will, and
no delight in any thing that
cannot stand with the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of, and obedience to
God. Thus a man by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:29272:95"/>
what his owne naturall
corruption is, he may know
what his affection is to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
things.</p>
            <p>First of all, there must
bee an estimation, an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
of God, and Christ;
for to avoyd misconceit,
wee take both these to bee
one, God our Father in
Christ, and Christ. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
Christ did for us in
love, hee did it from the
love of the Father, who
gave him: And when we
speake of the love of God,
wee speake of the love of
Christ to us. Therfore there
must bee a high esteeming,<note place="margin">There must be an esteeme of God and Christ.</note>
and valuing, and prizing of
God above all things in the
world, and of his love.</p>
            <p>Now this must needs be
so: for where grace is, it
gives a sanctified judgment;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:29272:96"/>
a sanctified judgement va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues
and esteemes things as
they are. Now the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
apprehending God
and his love to bee the best
thing to make us happy,
prizeth it above all, <hi>Whom
have I in heaven but thee?
Psal. 73.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal 73.</note> 
               <hi>and what have I in
earth in comparison of thee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
he prizeth God and his
love above all things in the
world.</p>
            <p>Now if we would know
if we have this judgement,
wee may know it by our
choyce; this valuing it is
known by choyce: for what
a man esteemes and values
highly, hee makes choyce of
above all things in the
world. What men make
choyce of, is seene by their
courses: we see it in holy
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:29272:96"/>
               <hi>Moses, Heb.</hi> 11.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> hee had a
high esteeme of the estate
of Gods people that affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
people: as afflicted as
they were, yet hee saw
they were Gods people,
in covenant with him,
and more regarded of him,
than all the people in the
world besides: and upon
his estimation hee made a
choyce, <hi>hee chose rather to
suffer afflictions with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, than to enjoy the
pleasures of sinne for a season</hi>
His choyce followed his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme:
so if we value and
esteeme God, and religion,
and love God above all
things, we wil make choice
of the Lord. As Saint <hi>Peter</hi>
sayth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.</note> when Christ
asked them, <hi>Will you also
forsake me?</hi> sayth hee, <hi>Lord,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:29272:97"/>
whither shall wee goe?</hi> Wee
have made choyce of thee,
<hi>whither shall wee goe? thou
hast the words of eternall life.</hi>
Let us doe that in truth, that
hee for a time failed to
doe, when hee sayd, <hi>Though
all forsake thee, yet will not
I.</hi> If wee make this choyce
of Christ, from the truth of
our hearts, this shewes our
esteeme.</p>
            <p>What is thy choyce? Is
it Religious wayes, and
religious company? is it
the feare of God above all
things? <hi>One thing have I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired,
that I may dwell in the
house of GOD for ever, and
visit his Temple.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 27.</note> Psalm. 27.
Hast thou with <hi>Mary,</hi> made
choyce of the better part?
Doest thou value thy selfe
as a member of Christ, and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:29272:97"/>
an heire of Heaven, as a
Christian above all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in this world? (for
what a man esteemes, hee
values himselfe by) then
thou art a true lover, thou
hast this love planted in thy
heart; because thou hast a
true esteeme? You see
<hi>Paul</hi> accounted <hi>all dung and
drosse in comparison of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
knowledge of Christ.</hi>
Oh! that wee could come
to that excellent affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value
all things to Christ,
and the good things by
Christ, and Religion. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it is universally true,
where Christ is loved, and
God in Christ, the price of
all things else fall in the
soule: For when we wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Christ, then fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:29272:98"/>
all that cannot stand
with Christ.</p>
            <p>Againe, our esteeme is
knowne by our willing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with any thing for
that that we esteeme, as a
wise Merchant doth sell
all for the Pearle. Wee
may know therefore that
wee esteeme GOD,<note place="margin">If we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme God, wee shall part with any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</note> and
his truth: for they goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
God, and his truth,
and religion; wee must
take God with all that hee
is cloathed with, wherein
he shewes himselfe unto us.
If wee sell all for the truth
of God, and part with all, &amp;
deny all for the love, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
of it, it is a signe
wee have an esteeme an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to his worth, and
that we love him.</p>
            <p>Those therfore that will
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:29272:98"/>
part with nothing for God,
nor for Religion, and the
Truth, when they are
called to it, doe they talke
of love to GOD? they
have no esteeme, they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
not GOD; if they did
esteeme him, they would
sell all for the pearl. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
those that halt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that care not which
way religion and the truth
goes, so they may have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and pleasures in this
world, where is their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
of the Gospell, and
of the truth of Christ, and
of God? they have no love,
because they have no esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>Againe, what we esteem
highly of, wee speake
largely of. A man is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
eloquent in that hee
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:29272:99"/>
esteemes: it will put him
to the extent of his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to bee as eloquent as
possible hee can bee: you
never knew a man want
words for that hee prized,
to set it out. Therefore
when wee want words to
prayse God, and to set out
the value of the best things,
it is an argument wee have
poore esteeme of them.
All goe together, GOD,
and the things of GOD:
What doe wee talke of
loving GOD, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
Christians, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?
they are never se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.
If a man esteeme
the best things, hee will be
often speaking of them. If
a man set his affections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a thing, it will suggest
words at will. Therefore
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:29272:99"/>
those that are cleane out of
their Theame, when they
speake of good things, are
to seeke. Alas, where is
the affection of love?
where is esteeme? esteeme
it makes a readinesse to
speake.</p>
            <p>Esteeme likewise carries
our thoughts: Wouldest
thou know what thou e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemest
highly? What
doest thou thinke of most,
and highest? thou mayest
know it by that. Wee see
the first branch, how wee
may know we love GOD,
if wee have a high esteeme,
and valuing of GOD, by
these signes.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 Where there is true love, there is a desire of union.</note> where there is
true love, and affection,
there is a desire of union, of
knitting and coupling with
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:29272:100"/>
the thing loved, of necessi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tie
it must be so: for love is
such a kinde of affection, it
drawes the soule all it can
to the thing loved; it hath a
magneticall force, the force
of a Load-stone. Every
one knowes what this
meanes.</p>
            <p>This affection of love
makes us one with that wee
love. If a man love the
world, hee is a worldling;
a man of the world; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
affection breeds uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
though a man bee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so base in choosing,
whatsoever a man loves, he
desires union with it, and
being so, hee hath his name
from that hee loves: hee
that loves the world, is a
worldling, an earth-worm.
Now if there be the love of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:29272:100"/>
God, as in covenant, as a
father in Christ, for so we
must conceive of GOD,
there will bee a desire of
fellowship and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with him by all meanes,
in the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
&amp;c. If a man desire
strangenesse, that he cares
not how seldome hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Sacrament, or
come into Gods presence, is
here love? how can love
and strangenesse stand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether?
thou art a strange
person from God, and the
things of God, thou hast no
joy in his presence, where
thou mayest enjoy his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
here in holy things in
this world, if thou delight
not in his presence, and in
union with him, how canst
thou say, thou lovest him?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:29272:101"/>
Can a man say he loves
him, whose company hee
cares not for? Thou carest
not for Gods company,
thou mayest meete him in
the Word and Sacraments,
and in good company,
<hi>Where two or three are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
together, I will be in the
middest.</hi> Doest thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
thou lovest GOD, if
thou carest not for these?
thou hast no fellowship in
this businesse: all that rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
not heavenly things,
they doe not love.</p>
            <p>Now to try whether we
have this branch of love,
that is, a desire of union.
Where therefore there is a
desire of union with the
partie loved, of uniting to
that person (for we speake
of persons) there wil bee a
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:29272:101"/>
desire of communion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a
<hi>desire of Vnion will breed a
desire of Communion;</hi> that is,
there will be a course taken
to open our mindes: if we
have a desire of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with GOD, wee will
open our soules often to
him in prayer; and we will
desire that hee will open
himselfe in speaking to our
hearts by his Spirit: And
wee will desire that he will
open his minde to us in his
Word: wee will bee care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to heare his Word, and
so maintain that sweet and
heavenly Commerce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
him and our soules,
by this entercourse of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him, and speaking to
him. <hi>Where two or three are
gathered together, I will bee in
the midst.</hi> Therefore th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and it dissolves, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unites

when wee are strange to

the other, and from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the day, to the
end of it, &amp; not be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with God, and not open
our soules to him, it is a
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:29272:102"/>
signe wee have no love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is no desire of
union, and communion
with him.</p>
            <p>Againe, where wee love,
we consult and advise,
and rest in that advice, as
comming from a loving
person; especially if he bee
as wise as loving: so in all
our consultations, wee will
goe to God, and take his
counsell; and when wee
have it, wee will account it
the counsell of one that is
wise and loving.</p>
            <p>Those therefore that trust

and such like, what doe
they speake of love, when

farre as wee are afraid of
death, and tremble at it,
so farre we want love.
When the contract is once
made betweene Christ and

eternal communion wee
shall have in heaven, where
we shall have all things in

it is from want of
faith and love. Therefore
we should bee ashamed of

He enters into those cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

to say, Oh! what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

of this and that: A good
Christian hath God to rest
in; he hath God reconciled
in Christ, and in his love he
plants himselfe in life and

Wee dwell in thee;
though in the world we are

<hi>Come unto mee, and yee shall

he may know by

what thou art crossed in,
thou wilt fetch out of Gods
love: thou wilt say, this

but God is mine, I can fetch

to bring our souls more and

            <p>Indeed where shall a

What will become of a man

            <p>The fourth and last is,

This is the nature of love, it
stirs up to please the partie
loved. <hi>Isaacks</hi> sons saw that
their father loved Venison,
therfore they provided ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nison
for him. Those that

that God may delight in. He
loves a humble, and a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
heart. <hi>Thou hast woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
me with one of thine eyes.</hi>
The eye of faith, when the
soule can trust in the word,
&amp; humbly go out of it self:
his delight is in a broken
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:29272:109"/>
yeelding heart, that hardnes
not it selfe against his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
but yeelds. A

Oh, <hi>it is a sacrifice that God is

<hi>the hidden man of the

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:29272:110"/>
then it is a signe wee love
him, when wee labour to
procure all things that may
give him content. You
know that love where it is,
it stirres up the affections
of the partie to remove all
things that are distastfull to
the partie it loves. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is a neat affection;
for it will make those neat,
that otherwise are not so,
because it will not offend:
much more this divine hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
affection, when it is
set on a right object, upon
God, it is a neat, cleanly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
it will purge the

Those therefore that are
carelesse of their wayes, and
carriage, and affections, that
make nothing of polluting,
and defiling their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and their wayes,
there is not the love of God
in their hearts. It stirres up

if they be great, there is
both love and respect meet

               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:29272:111"/>
God hates pride and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, &amp;c. therefore a man

<hi>Isaac</hi> when he was to marry

This affection of love

it is not a matter of the

            <p>Where love is in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

there will bee love of

it is his. It is such an
affection as sets the soule on

may I give content to such

&amp; inventions to please:

               </gap>t thinkes, can I
give consent in loving such,
and such? as Christ sayth, he
that respects these little

on my part, I will see
it answered. If the love of
Christ be in us, wee will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
this because wee will
thinke, Christ will regard
me for the good I doe for
his sake, and in his name, to
this and that partie. Thus
we see how we may try this

            <p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:29272:115"/>
And therefore where
there is a desire of giving
content, there will bee a
zeale against all things, to
remove all things in our
places, and callings, that
may offend: it will carry us
through all difficulties, to
please him, it will make
us willing to suffer. I will
please him, by suffering
some indignitie for his
cause. I will doe it, that I
may ingage his affection
to mee. Therefore the
Disciples gloried in this,
when they were thought
worthy to suffer for Christs
sake. Where there is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to please God, it is
so farre from being asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
or afraid to suffer, that
it joyes in this: Oh! now
there is, occasion given to

shew that God respects me
more, if I, for his sake,
stand out in his quarrel, and
breake through all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>It will make us please
him in all things that wee
are capable, in all things
that we can doe any way in
our standings; as Christ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
it out of <hi>Moses,</hi> to
<hi>love God with all our minde,
with all our soule,</hi> and with
all our strength, where love
is, it sets all on worke to
please, and give content.
It sets the minde on worke
to studie, wherein shall I
please God? and it will stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Gods truth, and not
serve him by our owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions:
<note place="margin">Love to God, studies how to please God.</note> wee must serve
and love GOD after his

how he will be served, and
to love him with all our
soule, &amp; with all our heart,
that is with all our heart,
that is with the marrow and
strength of our affections,
with all my strength, bee a

               </gap>ndition I
must love him, with al that

to. For it is a commanding
affection, and being so it
commands all within and
without to give content to
the person loved: it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
the wit to devise,
and the memorie to retaine
good things; it commands
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:29272:116"/>

anger to remove

It is a most active affection,

Sonne, and holy Ghost,
but when hee intends to
make us happy, it is a shame
that wee should not bestow
our affections upon him.</p>
            <p>Much might bee sayd to
this purpose for the triall of
our selves whether we love
God, or no. Let us not
then forget these things:
for it is the command both
of the old and new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they run both upon
love. <hi>I give you a new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi>
sayth Christ, and yet
it is no new command, but
old and ordinarie. But it is
commanded now in the
Gospell; that is, it is renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by new experiments of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:29272:117"/>
Gods love in Christ, <hi>that we
should love him, as hee hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
us,</hi> which is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully;
that wee should love
him, and <hi>love one another.</hi>
And all this is in this affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as we see when the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost would set out
the disposition and qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of such, as those
great things are prepared
for, that <hi>neither eye hath seen,
nor care heard, nor hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the heart of man,</hi>
hee sets it downe by
this, <hi>They are for
those that love
him.</hi>

hand to rayse up our spirits,
that by a tast we may know
what great things hee hath
reserved for us: but of these
things, and the use of them
I spake before.</p>
            <p>We came then to speake of
the qualificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the persons</p>
            <p>For them that love him.</p>
            <p>Not that we love <hi>God</hi> first,
and then <hi>God</hi> prepares these
things for us: but <hi>God</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
them, and acquaints us
what he meanes to doe with
us, and then we love him. A
christian knowes before, what
title he hath in <hi>Christ</hi> to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and then he works: he
knowes <hi>Christ</hi> hath wrought
salvation for him, and then he
workes out his salvation in a
course tending to salvation in a
course tending to salvation:
for there must be working
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29272:123"/>
in a course tending to the
possession of salvation, that
CHRIST hath purchased,
wee must not worke, and
thinke by it to merit Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
wee know wee have
Heaven, and those great
things in the Title of Christ,
and then wee fall on loving,
and working. There is a
cleane contrary order, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
us, and those merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,
they invert the order
of God, for, for whom God
hath prepared these things,
hee discovers them to the eye
of faith, and then faith works
by love: this I adde by the
way.</p>
            <p>Now he sets downe this
description of those persons
for whom these excellent
things are prepared, by this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29272:123"/>
affection of love, by this
grace of love, as being the
fittest for that purpose to
describe a Christian. Faith
is not so fit, because it is not
so discernable; we may know
our love, when wee cannot
know our Faith. Oft times
those that are excellent
Christians, they doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they beleive or no: but
aske them, whether they love
God, and his truth, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
or no? oh yes! they
doe. Now God intending to
comfort us, sets out such an
affection, as, a Christian may
best discerne: for of all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
we can discerne best
of our love. But to come to
the affection it selfe, there are
3. things in love.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:29272:124"/>
There is the
<list>
                  <item>Affection,</item>
                  <item>Passion,</item>
                  <item>Grace,</item>
               </list> of love
wee speake of the grace
here.</p>
            <p>The affection is naturall.</p>
            <p>The passion is the excesse
of the naturall affection, when
it over flowes its bound.</p>
            <p>Grace is the rectifying of
the naturall affection, and
the elevating, and raysing it
up to a higher object then
nature can pitch on. The
Spirit of God turnes nature
into grace, and workes cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
and passion out of
nature, and passion out of
nature, and elevates, and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
that, which is naturally
good, the affection of love,
to be a grace of love, hee
rayseth it up to love GOD
(which nature cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover)
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29272:124"/>
by spiritualizing of
it, hee makes it the most
excellent grace of all. So
that while I speake of the
love of <hi>God,</hi> thinke not that
I speake of the meet aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but of the affection that
hath a stamp of grace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it: for affections are
graces, when they are sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
And indeed all graces
(set illu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ination a side which
is in the understanding)
spring from this. What is
true grace, but joy, and love
and delight in the best
things, and all others spring
from love? What doe wee
hate, but what is opposite
to that we love? and when
are we angry, but when
that we love is opposed, and
wronged? Then there is a ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29272:125"/>
zeale: so that indeed all grace
is in the aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ctions, and all
affections are in this one
primitive affection, this first
borne, and bred affection,
love. I speake of it then as
a speciall grace. Now the
way of discerning of it wee
heard partly before. The way
to discerne of this sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
affection, this grace, is to
know what wee esteeme:
for love it is from an estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And likewise in the
second place esteeme breeds
a desire of union. And de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of union breeds content
in the thing, when wee have
it. And contentment in the
person breeds desire of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
backe againe. These
things I stood on, and will
not presse further.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:29272:125"/>
Let us examine, and trie
our selves oft by our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
how they stand biassed,
and poynted, whether to
God, and heaven whether to
God, and heaven ward, or to
the world: for we are, as we
love. For what wee love, we
(as it were) marry; and if
wee joyne our love to baser
things, we marry baser things
and so debase our selves:
if wee joyne in our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to things above our
selves, to God, and spirituall
things, we become spirituall
as they are. So that a man
stands in the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
two goods, somewhat
that is better then himselfe,
and something that is mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
and thereafter as hee
joynes in his affections, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
hee is: for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29272:126"/>
of love to <hi>God,</hi> and to
the best things makes him
exellent; and his affection
to baser things make him
base. Let a man be never so
great in the World, if his
affections to base, he is a base
person: therefore wee have
the more need <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o trie our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
            <p>But to answere some cases breifly.</p>
            <p>It will be objected, may
we not love any thing but
<hi>God,</hi> and holy things? may
we not love the Creatures,
because it is here specified
as a note of those, that these
things are <hi>prepared for those
that love God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yes; we may love them,
as we see somewhat of <hi>God</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:29272:126"/>
in them; as every creature
hath somewhat of GOD
in them; whereupon GOD
hath the style of every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that hath good in it.
Hee is called a <hi>Fountaine, a
Rocke, a Shield,</hi> every thing
that is good: to shew that
the Creatures, every one hath
somewhat of GOD; hee
would not have taken the
style of the Creature else.
We may love the Creature
as it hath somewhat of GOD
in it, a being, or comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
being, or somewhat,
and as it conveyes the love of
<hi>God</hi> to us, and leads us back
againe to <hi>God.</hi> There is no
Creature, but it convey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s,
some love, and beames, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of <hi>God</hi> to us, in some
kinde, and leads us to <hi>God:</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:29272:127"/>
so we may love other things.
We may love men and love
GOD in them, and love
them for God, to bring
them to God, to leave a
holy impression in them, to
bee like God, there is no
question of this: but the love
of God that is the spring of
all.</p>
            <p>But it will bee sayd by
some weake conscience, how
shall I know I love God,
when I love the world, and
worldly things? I love my
children, and other things
(perhaps that are not ill) I
feare I love them more then
God.</p>
            <p>We must know for this,
that when two streames run
in one channell, they runne
stronger then one streame,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29272:127"/>
when a man loves other good
things; nature goes with
grace, so nature going with
grace, the streame is strong:
but when a man loves God
and Christ, and heavenly
things, there is grace only,
nature yeilds nothing to
that. When a man loves his
children or his intimate
friends, &amp;c. Nature going
with grace, it is no wonder,
if the streame bee stronger
when two streames runne in
one. So corruption in ill
actions oft times carry the
affections strong. As in
many of our loves there is
somewhat naturall, that is
good, yet there is some cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
as to love a man
for ill; here nature, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
is strong: but in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29272:128"/>
supernaturall things grace
goes alone.</p>
            <p>Then againe we must not
judge by an indeliberate pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
by what our affection
is carried suddenly, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliberately
to: for so wee
may joy more in a sudden
thing, then in the best
things of all, as in the
sight of a friend there may
bee a sudden affection: but
the love of <hi>GOD</hi> it is a
constant streame, it is not
a <hi>Torrent</hi> but a <hi>Current,</hi> that
runnes all our life-time:
therefore those affections to
<hi>GOD,</hi> and heavenly things
in a Christian they are
perpetuall; they make no
great noyse perhaps, but
they are perpetuall in the
hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of a Christian: a

sudden <hi>Torrent,</hi> and passion
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nay transport a man, but
yet he may have a holy and
heavenly heart. I speake this
for comfort.</p>
            <p>I, but my love to God is faint
and little.</p>
            <p>Well, but it is a heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sparke, and hath divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in it; it is from Heaven,
and is growing, and vigorous
and efficacious: and a little
heavenly love, will wast all
carnall love at length, it is
of so vigorous, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
a nature. It is fed
still by the spirit; and a
little that is fedde, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
that is growing, that
hath a blessing in it, (as the
love of <hi>God</hi> in the hearts of
his hath: for <hi>God</hi> continually
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29272:129"/>
cherrisheth his owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning)
that little shall
never be quenched, but shall
overgrow nature at length;
and eate out corruption, and
all contrary love whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
Though for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
wee see corruption over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power,
and oppresse grace:
yet the love of God being
a divine sparke, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being more powerfull
(though it bee little) then
the contrary, it hath a blessing
in it to grow till at length
it consume all. For love is
like fire; as in other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
so in this, it wasts,
and consumes the contrary;
and rayseth up to Heaven,
and quickens, and enlivens
the persons, as fire doth:
and it makes lightsome
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:29272:129"/>
dead bodies, it transformes
them all into fire like it
selfe. So the love of God
by little and little trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes
us all to bee fiery, it
transformes us to be lovers.
These cases needed a little
touching to satisfie some,
that are good, and growing
christians, and must have
some satisfaction.</p>
            <p>But it may bee asked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
(as indeed wee see
it is true,) what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that sometime meaner
Christians have more lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
soules, then great
Schollers, men of great parts?
one would thinke that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
should increase love,
and affection.</p>
            <p>So it doth if it be a cleare
knowledge; but great wits
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:29272:130"/>
and pates and great Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
busie themselves about
questions, and intricacies,
and so they are not so
much about the affections
A poore Christian oft times
takes those things for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that they study, and
dispute, and canvasse, and
question: there is a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
light in his soule that
<hi>God</hi> is my Father in <hi>Christ,</hi>
and <hi>Christ God</hi> and man
is my Mediator hee takes
it for granted, and so his
affections are not troubled;
whereas the other having
corruption answerable to
his parts, great wit, and
great corruption, he is tang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with doubts, and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
he studies to informe
his brayne, the other to be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29272:130"/>
heated in his affections. A
poore Christian, cares not
for cold nicities that heate
not the heart, and affections;
he takes these for granted if
they be propounded in the
Scripture; instead of disput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e beleives, and loves,
and obeys; and that is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that many a po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re soule
goes to Heaven with a great
deale of joy, when others are
tangled, and wrapped in their
owne doubts: so much for
satisfying of these things.
To goe on therefore to give
a few directions how to have
this heavenly fire kindled in
us, to love <hi>God,</hi> considering
such great things are provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for those that love <hi>God,</hi> It
is a matter of consequence,
as we desire Heaven we must
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:29272:131"/>
desire this holy fire to bee
kindled in us.</p>
            <p>Let us know for a ground
(as it were) that it is our
duty to aime at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
pitch of love that wee
can, and not to rest in the
lowest. The lowest pitch of
loving GOD, is to love
GOD because he is good
to us, that is good, the
Scriptures stoupes so low
as to allow that, God would
have us love him, and holy
things for the benefit wee
have by them: but that is
mercinarie if we rest there:
but God stoupes to allure
us by promises, and favours,
though wee must not rest
there But we must love God,
not for our selves, but labour
to rise to this pitch, to love
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:29272:131"/>
our selves in God; and to see
that we have happinesse in
<hi>God,</hi> and not in our selves;
our being is in him, we
must love our selves in him,
and be content to be lost
in <hi>God:</hi> that is, so to love
<hi>God,</hi> that if he should cast
us away (his kindnesse is
better then life) doe others
what they will we will love
him, and our selves for his
excellencies, and because we
see our selves in him, and
are his children, we must
labour to rise to that, and
that is the highest pitch
that we can attaine to, we
must know that for a ground.</p>
            <p>And know this for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
that when we speake
of the love of <hi>God,</hi> we speake
of love incorporate into
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29272:132"/>
our conversations, and actions,
not of an abstracted love
and affection; but of love
in our places, and callings,
and standings, love invested
into action. Therefore the
Scripture sayth wee must
love <hi>God,</hi> with all our minde
with all our heart, with all
our power, and strength, that
is, in our particular places.
To make it cleare. When
we speake of love to <hi>God,</hi>
we speake of love to him
in our particular callings.
He loves <hi>God</hi> that is a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for <hi>Gods</hi> Sake; and he that
is a Minister, and teacheth
the people conscionably for
<hi>Gods</hi> Sake, and shewes
them the way to Heaven. He
loves <hi>God</hi> as a man in the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:29272:132"/>
common Wealth, a states
man, &amp;c. That in that
place seekes the glory of
GOD, and the good of the
Church, and Religion. Shall
men talke of love to GOD,
and their affections are
stirred up I know not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about?
No, it is an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that is discovered in
actions.</p>
            <p>How can wee love <hi>God</hi>
with all our might, except
as farre as our might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
our love extends? How
farre doth thy activitie,
thy power, thy sphere, that
thou canst doe any thing,
stretch? so farre must thy
love, and thou must shew
thy love in all the powers, and
abilities that <hi>God</hi> hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
thee with.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:29272:133"/>
For a man that hath
great place, and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to doe good, and to
thinke it enough onely to
love <hi>God</hi> in his Closet, &amp;c.
This is not the love wee
speake of. A man must
love <hi>God</hi> with all his might,
as hee stands invested in
relation this way or that
way.</p>
            <p>The love of <hi>God</hi> in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
man, will not serve for
a Magistrate, or a publik
man: hee must shew hi
love in his place by stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the gappe, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all the ill, and to doe
all the good hee can, every
man must doe so, but such
a one more especially, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>God</hi> hath tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed him
with more; Well, these
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:29272:133"/>
things premised, to come to
some directions how to come
to love <hi>God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First of all, the way to
love <hi>God</hi> is to have a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
light, to discover
what wee are in our selves,
and our emptinesse: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as we are, we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
love <hi>God</hi> till wee see in
what need wee stand of
his favour, and grace, that
wee are damned Creatures
else.</p>
            <p>Now when we come to
have our eyes opened to see
our sinfulnesse, and empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
we will make out to
<hi>God,</hi> and make out to his
mercy in CHRIST above
all things. Indeed the first
love is the love of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
before we come to a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:29272:134"/>
love of friendship, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
with <hi>God:</hi> a love
to goe out to him, and to
depend upon him for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and grace, and all. A love
that riseth from the sense of
our misery, and goes to him
for supply.</p>
            <p>There is a sweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of misery, and
mercie; of emptinesse, and
fulnesse; of beggery, and
riches.</p>
            <p>Now when wee see our
owne misery, and beggery,
and sinfulnesse, and then a
fulnesse in <hi>God</hi> to supply,
of riches to enrich us every
way, then this breeds a
love; this is the way to all
other loves that follow. And
where this is not premised,
and goes before, a man
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:29272:134"/>
will never delight in <hi>God.</hi>
In <hi>Luke</hi> 7. That good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
she loved much, why?
much was forgiven her,
many sinnes were forgiven
her.</p>
            <p>So when the soule shall
see what need it hath of
forgiving mercy, of pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
mercy, and how many
great debts GOD hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
us in CHRIST,
there will bee a great deal
of love because there is a
great deal forgiven. And
we must begin indeed with
seeing the infinite mercy of
GOD before any other at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
of <hi>God,</hi> and then
we shall love him after.
This is the first thing. There
is no soule that ever loves
<hi>God</hi> so, as the poore soule
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:29272:135"/>
that hath been abased with
the sense of sinne, and its
emptinesse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>at it is empty
of all goodnesse, and then
sees a supply in the mercy
of <hi>GOD</hi> in <hi>Christ;</hi> those
soules love <hi>GOD</hi> above
all.</p>
            <p>Another way to love <hi>God,</hi>
is to consider of his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
goodnesse, to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate,
and thinke of it, he
is good, and doth good,
it is a Communicative good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Let us thinke of his
goodnesse, and the strea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of it our to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The whole Earth is
full of the goodnesse of the
Lord. What are all the
Creatures, but <hi>Gods</hi> good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?
Wee can see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the goodnesse of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:29272:135"/>
               <hi>God,</hi> what is all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
but <hi>Deus explicatus,
God</hi> unfolded to our sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses?
he offers himselfe to our
bodies, and soules, all is <hi>Gods</hi>
goodnesse.</p>
            <p>And then see this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
fitted to us, it is a
fit goodnesse that comes
from <hi>God,</hi> he is good, and
doth good, and so fitly, he
proportions his goodnesse:
for hee hath fitted every
part of us, soule, and body
with goodnesse, all the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
with goodnesse: what
doe we see but goodnesse
in colours? What doe we
heare but his good in those
delights that come that
way? We tast, and feele
his goodnesse, against the
cold we have cloathing in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:29272:136"/>
hunger, wee have food,
in all necessities in all
exigences wee have fit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
of God for all
necessities whatsoever out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>But then for our soules,
what food hath he for that?
the death of CHRIST
his owne sonne to feed our
soules. The soule is a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
substance, and hee
thought nothing good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to feed it but his own
sonne; wee feed on Gods
love in giving CHRIST to
death, and on CHRISTS
love in giving himselfe to
death.</p>
            <p>The soule being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
troubled with the
guilt of some sinne or other,
it feeds on this, it is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:29272:136"/>
with CHRIST every
day more, and more, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
at the Sacrament. Thus
we see how GOD hath fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his goodnesse to us.
And then in particular dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
how hee fits us with
severall deliverances, so sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably,
as we may see Gods
love in it.</p>
            <p>Then as GODS good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is great, and fit, so
it is neare us; it is not
a goodnesse a farre off, but
GOD followes us with
his goodnesse in whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
condition wee bee:
hee applies himselfe to us,
and hee hath taken upon
him neare relations, that
hee might bee neare us
in goodnesse, hee is a
Father, and every where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:29272:137"/>
to maintaine us. Hee is
a Husband, and every
where to helpe; hee is a
friend, and every where to
comfort, and counsell:
so his love it is a neare
love: therefore hee hath
taken upon him the nearest
relations, that we may never
want <hi>God,</hi> and the testimonies
of his love.</p>
            <p>And then againe this
goodnesse of God which
is the object of love, it is
a free goodnesse meerely
from himselfe, and an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowing
goodnesse, and
an everlasting goodnesse, it
is never drawn drie, hee
loves us unto life everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
he loves us in this
World, and followes us
with signes of his love in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:29272:137"/>
all the parts of us, in
body, and soule, till hee
hath brought body, and soule
to Heaven to enjoy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
for ever there. These,
and such like considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
may serve to stirre us up
to love God, and direct us
how to love God.</p>

and more brute then
the very brutes: benefits
will moove the very brute
Creatures. So I say these
favours to us in particuler
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:29272:138"/>
should moove us, except
wee will bee more brute,
then the brutes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>Especially to moove us
all, consider some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities
of favours to
us more then to others:
for specialties doe much
increase love, and res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>
            <p>Consider how God hath
followed thee with good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
outwardly, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have beene neglected.
Thou hast a place in the
World, and Riches, and
Friends, when many other
excellent persons want all
these. There are some
common favours to all
Christians: as the favour
wee have in CHRIST,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:29272:138"/>
forgivenesse of sins, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and such other
favours. But there bee some
specialties of Devine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares that GODS provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
hath watched over
us in some particulars more
then others, those bee
speciall ingagements. And
is there any of us that
cannot say that <hi>GOD</hi>
hath dealt specially in give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them some mercie
more then to others? I
adde this therefore to the
rest.</p>
            <p>Againe to help<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> us to
stirre up this grace of
love, consider those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of loveing, of
those that have then lived
in former times: take
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:29272:139"/>
               <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
holy men. <hi>David</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
at his owne love. <hi>Lord
how doe I love thy Law?</hi>
And have wee not more
cause comparing the grounds
of our affection, when
wee have more then they
in those times? What,
did hee wonder at his love
of GODS Law, when
the Canon was so short?
they had onely <hi>Moses,</hi> and
some few Bookes; and wee
have the Canon inlarged,
wee have both the old,
and new Testament: shall
not wee say much more,
how doe I love thy Law,
thy Gospell, and Divine
truthes? This should shame
us, when they in darke
times so loved the truth of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:29272:139"/>
GOD, and wee see all
cleare and open, and yet are
cold?</p>
            <p>Likewise it is good in
this case to converse with
those, that are affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate:
as face answereth face,
so spirit answers spirit, as
<hi>Iron sharpneth Iron,</hi> so one
sharpens another. Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
with cold ones will
make one cold. <hi>For the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of iniquitie, the
love of many shall wax cold.</hi>
Conversing with sinfull
cold people casts a dampe
upon us: but let us labour,
if we will bee wise for our
soules, when wee finde any
coldnesse of affection, to
converse with those that
have sweete, and heavenly
affections, it will mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaylously
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:29272:140"/>
worke upon our
hearts.</p>
            <p>I might say much
this way to stirre us up, and
direct us how to love
<hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But indeed nothing will so
much inable us to love <hi>God,</hi>
as a new nature: nature will
love without provocation:
the fire will burne, because
it is fire; and the water will
moysten, because it is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and a holy man will
love holy things, because
hee is holy: a spirituall
soule will love spirituall
things, because hee is
spirituall: therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
all, adde this that
our natures bee changed
more, and more, that they
be sanctified, and circumcis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:29272:140"/>
as <hi>God</hi> hath promised,
<hi>I will circumcise your hearts,
that yee may love me.</hi> There
must bee a circumcised
heart to love <hi>God,</hi> wee must
bee sanctified to love <hi>God:</hi>
for if nature bee not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,
there cannot bee
this new Commandement
of love; Why is love
called <hi>a new Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and an old Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is called old for the
<hi>Letter,</hi> because it was a
command in <hi>Moses time,</hi>
thou <hi>shalt love the Lord with
all thy soule.</hi> But now it
is <hi>a new Commandement:</hi>
because there is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of spirit given by
CHRIST, and the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
sanctifies us, and writes
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29272:141"/>
this affection in our hearts.
It was written in stone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
but now it is written
in our hearts by the spirit.
And now there are new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives,
and motives to love,
since CHRIST came, and
gave himselfe for us, new
incouragments, and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
to love, therefore it
is a new Commandement,
from new grounds, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that are more a great
deale then before Christ.
But there must be a new heart
to obey this new command
of love; the old heart will
never love.</p>
            <p>Therefore we must with
all the meanes that may be
used, begge the spirit of
sanctification, especially, beg
the discovery of Gods love
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:29272:141"/>
to us: for our love is but a
reflection of Gods love: we
cannot love God except he
love us first: now our love
being a reflection of Gods
love, we must desire that he
would give us his spirit, to
reveale his love: that the
spirit being a witnesse of
Gods love to us, may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
be a spirit of love, and
sanctification in us.</p>
            <p>And let us labour to grow
more in the assurance of Gods
love, and all the evidences
of it, let us dwell long in
the meditation of these
things, the dwelling in the
meditation of Gods love, it
will make us to love him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
as many beames in
a burning glasse, meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
they cause a fire
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:29272:142"/>
many thoughts of the many
fruites of <hi>Gods</hi> love in this
World, and what hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
us in the World to
come, our hearts dwelling
on them, these beames will
kindle a holy fire in our
hearts.</p>
            <p>Many are troubled with
cold affections, and wish
oh! that they could love!
they forget the way how to
love, they will not meditate;
and if they doe meditate
they thinke to worke love
out of their owne hearts,
They may as well worke
fire out of a Flint, and
water out of a stone: our
hearts are a barren Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse.
Therefore let us
begge the spirit that <hi>God</hi>
would alter our hearts, with
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:29272:142"/>
meditation and all other
helpes: that <hi>God</hi> would
sanctifie us, and discover
his love to us, and that hee
would give us his spirit
(for hee doth the one where
he doth the other,) when
<hi>God</hi> doth so, then wee shall
bee enabled to love him.
Wee must not thinke to
bring love to <hi>God,</hi> but we
must fetch love from <hi>God,</hi>
wee must light our Candle
at his fire: thinke of his
love to us, and begge the
spirit of love from him,
love is a <hi>fruit of the spirit</hi>
That is the course wee
ought to take, for <hi>GOD</hi>
will teach our hearts to
love.</p>
            <p>Now to stirre us up the
more, to adde some motives,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:29272:143"/>
and incouragments to labour
more to get this affection.
Let us consider seriously
that without this love or
<hi>God</hi> we are dead, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
comes from us it is
still-borne, it is dead: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
love wee are nothing,
without love all that comes
from us is nothing, without
love <hi>I am as a tinkling Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball</hi>
sayth <hi>Paul.</hi> For a man
to be nothing in Religion,
and all that comes from him
to be dead, and still-borne,
to bee abortive actions who
would bee in such a cafe?
Therefore let us labour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we doe any thing that
is good to have our hearts
kindled with the love of
God, and then we shall be
somebody, and that that we
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:29272:143"/>
doe will be acceptable, for
love sweetens all performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
It is not the action, but
the love in the action: as
from God it is not the dead
favour that comes from him
that comforts the soule of a
Christian so much, as the
love, and sweetnesse of God
in the favour, that is better
then the thing it selfe, when
we have favour from God in
outward favours; Consider
the sweetnesse <hi>tast and see
how gracious the Lord is Psal.</hi>
34.<note place="margin">Psal. 34.</note> The tast of the love and
favour of God in the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
is better then the thing
is selfe, for it is but a dead
thing. And so from us back
againe to God, what are
the things wee performe to
him? they are dead: but
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:29272:144"/>
when they are sweetned with
the affection of love, done
to him as a father in Christ,
he tasts our performances as
sweet; love makes all wee
doe to have a relish, and all
that he doth to us: therefore
wee should labour for this
sweet affection.</p>
            <p>And with all consider,
that we may be called to doe
many things in this World;
surely there are none of us
but wee have many holy
actions to performe, wee
have many things to suffer,
and indure in the World,
many temptations to resist;
what shall, or will carry us
through all? Nothing, but
love; if we have loving, and
gracious hearts, this affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will carry us through
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:29272:144"/>
all good actions, through all
oppositions and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
for <hi>love is strong as death.</hi>
Considering therefore that
there are so many things that
will require this affection,
this blessed wing, and winde
of the soul, to carry us along
in spight of all that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
through all oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
let us labour for love,
and that affection will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
us through all. Indeed if
we have that, it is no matter
what a man suffers: a man
can never be miserable that
hath this affection of love;
if this heavenly fire be kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in him, he cannot be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
take him in what
condition you will, take him
upon the wrack. S. <hi>Paul</hi> in
the dungen sung at midnight
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:29272:145"/>
in the dungeon, in the stocks,
at an uncomfortable time,
and place, when he had been
misused, his heart was inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to sing to God out of
love. Nay every thing increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
it; the things we suffer,
increaseth this flame: let a
man love God, whatsoever he
suffers in a good cause it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth
his love, hee shall
find his love increased with
it; the more hee loves the
more he can suffer, and the
more he suffers the more he
loves <hi>God,</hi> and the more he
increaseth in a joyfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of the times to
come: and love is alway with
joy &amp; hope, and other sweet
affections; it drawes joy with
it alwayes, and hope of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
things; and as joy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:29272:145"/>
and hope increaseth,
so a mans happinesse increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
in this World. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is no matter what a
man suffers that hath a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
and loving heart, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
by the Spirit of <hi>God:</hi>
let him never thinke of what
he suffereth of paine, of los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and crosses, if <hi>God</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
his fatherly breast, and
shine on him in Christ, and
he looke on <hi>God</hi> reconciled,
and tast of the joyes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
before hand: if you tell
him of sufferings, you tell
him of that that incourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
him. It is an argument I
might be long in, and to great
purpose: for if we get this
holy fire kindled once, we
shall need little exhortation
to other duties, it would
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:29272:146"/>
set us on worke to all, and
like the fire of the Sanctuary
that never went out: so it
is such an affection, that if
it bee once kindled in the
heart it will never out. It is
a kinde of miracle in ill when
we love other things besides
<hi>God,</hi> baser then our selves;
it is as much as if a River
should turne backward. For
man that is an excellent
Creature, to be carried with
the streame of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to things worse then
himselfe, it is a kind of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
for a man to abuse his
understanding so. What a
base thing is it for a man to
suffer such a sweete streame
as love a holy current to run
into a sinke? who would
turne a sweete streame into a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:29272:146"/>
sinke, and not rather into a
garden? into a sweet place,
to refresh that? Our love is
the best thing in the World,
and who deserves it better
then <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Christ?</hi> we can
never returne any thing, but
this affection of love, wee
may againe. And can wee
place it better then upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
things, whereby we are
made better our selves? doth
<hi>God</hi> require our affections
for himselfe? No; it is to
make us happy. It advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
our affection to love
him, it is the turning of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the right streame. It is
the making of us happy that
<hi>God</hi> requires it. For consider
all things that may deserve
this affection. It will keepe
us from all sin: what is any
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:29272:147"/>
sin, but the abuse of love? for
the crookednesse of this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
turnes us to present
things that is the cause of all
sinne. For what is all sin, but
pleasure, and honours, and
profits the 3. <hi>Idolls</hi> of the
World? all sin, is about them.
And what are all good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
but love well place<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>? the
well ordering of this affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is the well ordering of our
lives, and the misplacing
of this affection is the cause
of all sinne.</p>
            <p>And to make us the more
carefull this way, consider
that when wee place our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
upon any thing else,
consider the vanity of it; we
loose our love, and the thing,
and our selves. For whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
else wee love, if we love
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:29272:147"/>
not <hi>God</hi> in it, and love it for
<hi>God;</hi> it will perish, and come
to nothing ere long. The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
perisheth with the
thing, we loose our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the thing, and loose
our selves too misplaceing
of it. These are forcible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
with understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
persons. And if we would
use our understanding, and
consideration, and meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and our soules, as wee
should, to consider of the
grounds, and incouragments
we have to love <hi>God,</hi> and the
best things whereby we may
be dignified above our selves,
it would not be as it is: we
should not bee so devoyd of
grace, and comfort. It was
a miracle that the 3. yong
men should bee in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:29272:148"/>
of the furnace, and bee
there as if they were in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place, no hotter. And it
is a miracle that men should
be in the middest of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
that we have
to love <hi>God:</hi> as there is not
the like reasons for any thing
in the World to keepe our
soules in a perpetuall heat,
of affection to love <hi>God;</hi> no
motives, or arguments, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives,
all are nothing to
the multitude of arguments,
we have to inflame our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections:
and yet to be cold
in the middest of the fire, it
is a kind of a miracle, to have
darke understandings, and
dead affections: that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all the heavenly
meanes we have to keepe a
perpetuall flame of love to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:29272:148"/>
               <hi>God,</hi> yet to be cold, and darke
in our soules: let us bewayle
it, and be ashamed of it.</p>
            <p>What doe we professe our
selves? Christians, heires of
Heaven, so beloved of <hi>God</hi> as
that he gave his owne Sonne
to deliver us, being rebells,
and enemies, in so cursed a
state, as we are all in by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
poore Creatures, inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to the Angells that fell,
that he should love man;
sinfull dust, and ashes so
much as to give his owne
Son to free us from so great
misery, and to advance us to
so great happinesse, to set us
in <hi>heavenly places with Christ,</hi>
and to have perpetuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with him in Heaven,
to have such incouragements,
and to be cold, and dead
