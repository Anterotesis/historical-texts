         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Learning and Poetick Skill were

            <p>AS we account thoſe Books beſt writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

Lives, eſpecially them of Poets, who have
laid out themſelves for the publick Good;
and under the Notion of Fables, delivered
unto us the higheſt Myſteries of Learning.
Theſe are the Men who in their Heroick Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems
have made mens Fames live to eternity;
therefore it were pity (ſaith <hi>Plutarch</hi>) that
thoſe who write to Eternity, ſhould not live
ſo too. Now above all Remembrances by
which men have endeavoured even in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight

and the Statue of <hi>Jupiter</hi> in Achaya,
were they not all to purchaſe an immortal

            <p>By this you may ſee that frail Paper is
more durable than Braſs or Marble; and
the Works of the Brain more laſting than
that of the Hand; ſo true is that old Verſe,
Marmora <hi>Maeonij</hi> vincunt Monumenta

            <p>Now though it is the deſire of all Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to purchaſe to themſelves immortal
Fame, yet is their Fate far different; ſome
deſerve Fame, and have it; others neither
have it, nor deſerve it; ſome have it not
deſerving, and others, though deſerving,
yet totally miſs it, or have it not equall
to their Deſerts: Thus have I known a
<pb facs="tcp:59216:8"/>
well writ Poem, after a double expence
of Brain to bring it forth, and of Purſe to
publiſh it to the World, condemned to the
Drudgery of the <hi>Chandler</hi> or <hi>Oyl-man,</hi> or,
which is worſe, to light <hi>Tobacco.</hi> I have
read in Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi>'s <hi>Englands Worthies,</hi> that
Mr. <hi>Nathanael Carpenter,</hi> that great Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
for <hi>Logick,</hi> the <hi>Mathematicks, Geography,</hi>
and <hi>Divinity,</hi> ſetting forth a Book of <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
he found, to his great grief, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
thereof in his Printers Houſe, <hi>Caſing
Chriſtmas-Pies,</hi> and could never after from
his ſcattered Notes recover an Original
thereof; thus (ſaith he) <hi>Pearls</hi> are no
<hi>Pearls,</hi> when <hi>Cocks</hi> or <hi>Coxcombs</hi> find them.</p>
            <p>There are two things which very much
diſcourage Wit; ignorant Readers, and
want of <hi>Mecaenaſſes</hi> to encourage their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.
For the firſt, I have read of an
eminent Poet, who paſſ by a company
of Bricklayers at work, who were repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome of his Verſes, but in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as quite marred the Sence and Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them; he ſnatching up a Hammer,
fell to breaking their Bricks; and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the reaſon thereof, he told them,
that <hi>they ſpoiled his Work, and he ſpoiled
theirs.</hi> And for the ſecond; what greater
encouragement to Ingenuity than Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity?

            </q>
            <p>But ſome will ſay, it is not ſo much the
<hi>Patrons</hi> as the <hi>Poets</hi> fault, whoſe wide
Mouths ſpeak nothing but Bladders and Bum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſt,

            <p>Indeed ſuch Pedlars to the Muſes, whoſe

not the name of Poets, and are juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
as the common Scriblers of the times:
but for ſuch who fill'd with <hi>Phebean</hi>-fire,
deſerve to be crowned with a wreath of
Stars; for ſuch brave Souls, the darlings
<pb facs="tcp:59216:10"/>
of the <hi>Delian</hi> Deity, for theſe to be ſcorn'd,
contemn'd, and diſregarded, muſt needs be
the fault of the times; I ſhall only give you
one inſtance of a renowned Poet, out of the
ſame Author.</p>
            <q>
               <l>On <hi>Butler,</hi> who can think without juſt rage,</l>
               <l>The glory and the ſcandal of the age;</l>
               <l>Fair ſtood his hopes, when firſt he came to
Town,</l>
               <l>Met every where with welcoms of renown,</l>
               <l>Courted, and lov'd by all, with wonder read,</l>
               <l>And promiſes of Princely favour fed:</l>
               <l>But what reward for all had he at laſt,</l>
               <l>After a life in dull expectance paſs'd?</l>
               <l>The wretch at ſumming up his miſpent days,</l>
               <l>Found nothing left, but poverty, and praiſe:</l>
               <l>Of all his gains by Verſe he could not ſave</l>
               <l>Enough to purchaſe Flannel, and a grave:</l>
               <l>Reduc'd to want, he in due time fell ſick,</l>
               <l>Was fain to die, and be interr'd on Tick:</l>
               <l>And well might bleſs the Feaver that was
ſent,</l>
               <l>To rid him hence, and his worſe fate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Thus you ſee though we have had ſome
comparable to <hi>Homer</hi> for Heroick Poeſie,
and to <hi>Euripides</hi> for Tragedy, yet have they
died diſregarded, and nothing left of them,
<pb facs="tcp:59216:10"/>
but that only once there were ſuch Men and
Writings in being.</p>
            <p>I ſhall, in the next place, ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of my Undertakings, in writing the
Lives of theſe Renowned Poets. Two
things, I ſuppoſe, may be laid to my
charge; the one is the omiſſion of ſome
that ought with good reaſon to have been
mentioned; and the other, the mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of thoſe which without any injury
might have been omitted. For the firſt,
as I have begg'd pardon at the latter end of
my Book for their omiſſion, ſo have I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
(if God ſpare me life ſo long) upon
the firſt opportunity, or ſecond Edition
of this Book, to do them right. In the
mean time I ſhould think my ſelf much
beholding to thoſe perſons who would give
me any intelligence herein, it being beyond
the reading and acquaintance of any one
ſingle perſon to do it of himſelf.</p>
            <p>And yet, let me tell ye, that by the
Name of Poet, many more of former
times might have been brought in than
what I have named, as well as thoſe which
I have omitted that are now living, namely,
Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Weever,</hi>
Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> Dr. <hi>Fuller,</hi> &amp;c. but the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
growing as big as the Bookſeller
at preſent was willing to have it, we ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:59216:11"/>
reſerve them to another time, they having
already eternized their Names by the never
dying Hiſtories which they have wrote.</p>
            <p>Then for the ſecond thing which may
be objected againſt me, That I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed
ſome of the meaneſt rank; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
That comparatively, it is a leſs fault
to incert two, than to omit one, moſt of
which in their times were of good eſteem,
though now grown out of date, even as
ſome learned Works have been at firſt
not at all reſpected, which afterwards
have been had in high eſtimation; as it
is reported of Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> who
being Priſoner in the Tower, expecting
every hour to be ſacrificed to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
cruelty, ſome few days before he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
he ſent for Mr. <hi>Walter Burre,</hi> who
had formerly printed his firſt Volume of
of <hi>the Hiſtory of the World,</hi> whom, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
by the hand, after ſome other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe,
he ask'd him, How that Work
of his had ſold? Mr. <hi>Burre</hi> returned this
anſwer, That it ſold ſo ſlowly, that it
had undone him. At which words of
his, Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> ſtepping to his
Desk, reaches the other part of his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
to Mr. <hi>Burre,</hi> which he had brought
down to the times he lived in; clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
his hand on his breaſt, he took
<pb facs="tcp:59216:11"/>
the other unprinted part of his Works into
his hand with a ſigh, ſaying, <hi>Ah my Friend,
hath the firſt Part undone thee? The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Volume ſhall undo no more; this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
World is unworthy of it;</hi> When
immediately going to the fire-ſide he threw
it in, and ſet his foot on it till it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.
As great a Loſs to Learning as
Chriſtendom could have, or owned; for
his firſt Volume after his death ſold Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands.</p>
            <p>It may likewiſe be objected, That ſome
of theſe Poets here mentioned, have been
more famous in other kind of Studies than
in Poetry, and therefore do not ſhine
here as in their proper ſphere of fame;
but what then, ſhall their general know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
debar them from a particular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of their Abilities in this moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Art? Nor have we ſcarce any Poet
excellent in all its Species thereof; ſome
addicting themſelves moſt to the <hi>Epick,</hi>
ſome to the <hi>Dramatick,</hi> ſome to the <hi>Lyrick,</hi>
other to the <hi>Elegiack,</hi> the <hi>Epaenitick,</hi> the
<hi>Bucolick,</hi> or the <hi>Epigram;</hi> under one of
which all the whole circuit of <hi>Poetick Deſign</hi>
is one way or other included.</p>
            <p>Beſides, ſhould we have mentioned none
but thoſe who upon a ſtrict ſcrutiny the
Name of Poet doth belong unto, I fear me
<pb facs="tcp:59216:12"/>
our number would fall much ſhort of thoſe
which we have written; for as one writes,
<hi>There are many that have a Fame deſervedly
for what they have writ, even in Poetry itſelf,
who, if they come to the teſt, I queſtion how well
they would endure to open their Eagle-eyes
againſt the Sun.</hi> But I ſhall wade no further
in this Diſcourſe, deſiring you to accept of
what is here written.</p>

about the Reign of King
<hi>Henry</hi> the Second; much eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

of thoſe times) term him a Rhymer, whilſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more courteously call him a Poet: Indeed
his Language is ſuch, that he is dumb in effect, to
the Readers of our Age, without an Interpreter;
which that ye may the better perceive, hear theſe
his Verſes of <hi>Mulmutius Lunwallo,</hi> in the very ſame

               <p>Antiquaries (amongſt whom Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>) more
value him for his Hiſtory than Poetry, his Lines
being neither ſtrong nor ſmooth, yet much inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<hi>Cheſter,</hi> and bred a <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monk in the
Monaſtery of St. <hi>Werburg;</hi> the Life of which
Saint he wrote in Verſe, as alſo (ſaith my Author)
a no bad Chronicle, though following therein thoſe
Authors, who think it the greateſt Glory of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to fetch their Original from times out of

he flouriſhed a Century of years afterwards,

and Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> avoweth that <hi>Dunington-Caſtle</hi>

that his Father was a Knight, and that he was born
at <hi>Woodſtock.</hi> 3. The Author of his Life, ſet
forth 1602. proveth him born in <hi>London,</hi> out of
theſe his own words in the <hi>Teſtament of Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo in the City of <hi>London,</hi> that is to me ſo dear
and ſweet, in which I was forth grown, and more

and peace in that ſtede to abide, thilke peace ſhould thus
there haue been broken, which of all wiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> men is
commened and deſired.</p>
               <p>For his Parentage, although <hi>Bale</hi> writes, he
termeth himſelf <hi>Galfridus Chaucer nobili loco natus,
&amp; ſummae ſpei juvenis;</hi> yet is the opinion of ſome
Heralds (otherwiſe than his Virtues and Learning
commemded him) he deſcended not of any great
Houſe, which they gather by his Arms: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
both in reſpect of the Name, which is <hi>French,</hi>
as alſo by other Conjectures, it may be gathered,
that his Progenitors were Stranngers; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were Merchants (for that in places
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59216:25"/>
where they have dwelled, the Arms of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
of the Staple have been ſeen in the Glaſs-windows)
or whether they were of other Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
it is not much neceſſary to ſearch; but weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
no doubt they were, and of good account in
the Commonwealth, who brought up their Sons
in ſuch ſort, that both he was thought fit for the
Court at home, and to be employed for Matters
of State in Foreign Countries.</p>
               <p>His Education, as <hi>Leland</hi> writes, was in both
the Univerſities of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by his own words, in his Book Entituled
<hi>The Court of Love:</hi> And in <hi>Oxford</hi> by all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
in <hi>Canterbury</hi> or in <hi>Merton</hi> Colledge, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
his Time in the Univerſity, he became a
witty Logician, a ſweet Rhetorician, a grave
Philoſopher, a holy Divine, a skilful Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician,
and a pleaſant Poet; of whom, for the
Sweetneſs of his Poetry, may be ſaid that which
is reported of <hi>Steſicho<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

called the Pith and Sinews of Eloquence, and the
very Life it ſelf of all Mirth and pleaſant Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
Beſides, one Gift he had above other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
and that is, by the Excellencies of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
to poſſeſs his Readers with a ſtronger
imagination of ſeeing that done before their eyes
which they read, than any other that ever writ in
any Tongue. But above all, his Book of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury-Tales,</hi>

               <p>By his Travel alſo in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi>
where he ſpent much time in his young years, but
more in the latter end of the Reign of King <hi>Richard</hi>
the Second; he attained to a great perfection in
all kind of Learning, as <hi>Bale</hi> and <hi>Leland</hi> report of
him: <hi>Circa poſtremos</hi> Richardi <hi>Secundi annos,</hi> Galliis
<hi>floruit, magnamque illic ex aſſidua in Literis exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione

About the latter end of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's
Days, he flouriſhed in <hi>France,</hi> and got himſelf
into high eſteem there by his diligent exerciſe in
Learning: After his return home, he frequented
the Court at <hi>London,</hi> and the Colledges of the
<hi>Lawyers,</hi> which there interpreted the Laws of the
Land. Amongſt whom was <hi>John Gower,</hi> his great
familiar Friend, whoſe Life we wrote before. This
<hi>Gower,</hi> in his Book entituled <hi>Confeſſio Amantis,</hi>
termeth <hi>Chaucer</hi> a worthy Poet, and maketh him
as it were the Judge of his Works.</p>
               <p>This our <hi>Chaucer</hi> had always an earneſt deſire
to enrich and beautifie our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59216:26"/>
in thoſe days was very rude and barren; and this
he did, following the example of <hi>Dantes</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarch,</hi>
who had done the ſame for the <hi>Italian</hi>
Tongue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

any of them in the performance hereof; and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
in this reſpect is much beholding to him; as
<hi>Leland</hi> well noteth:

of their approving of him. Mr. <hi>Aſcham,</hi> in

no doubt to ſay, that he valueth his Authority of
as high eſtimation as he did either <hi>Sophocles</hi> or <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides</hi>
in <hi>Greek.</hi> And in another place, where he
declareth his Opinion of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Verſifying, he
uſeth theſe Words; Chaucer <hi>and</hi> Petrark <hi>thoſe
two worthy Wits, deſerve juſt praiſe.</hi> And laſt of
all, in his Diſcourſe of <hi>Germany,</hi> he putteth him
nothing behind either <hi>Thucydides</hi> or <hi>Homer,</hi> for
his lively Deſcriptions of Site of Places, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Perſons, both in outward Shape of Body,
and inward Diſpoſition of Mind; adding this
withal, That not the proudeſt that hath written

him.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Spenſer</hi> in his firſt Eglogue of his <hi>Shepherds

comparing him to the worthineſs of the
<hi>Roman Tityrus, Virgil.</hi> In his <hi>Fairy Queen,</hi> in his
Diſcourſe of Friendſhip, as thinking himſelf moſt
worthy to be <hi>Chaucer</hi>'s friend, for his like natural
diſpoſition that <hi>Chaucer</hi> had; he writes, That

him, durſt preſume to revive <hi>Chaucer</hi>'s loſt labours
in that imperfect Tale of the Squire, but only
himſelf: which he had not done, had he not felt
(as he ſaith) the infuſion of <hi>Chaucer</hi>'s own ſweet
Spirit ſurviving within him. And a little before,
he calls him the moſt Renowned and Heroical
Poet, and his Writings the Works of Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Wit; concluding his commendation in this
manner:
<q>

firſt place of our chiefeſt Poets. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59216:29"/>
that both old and new Writers have carried
this reverend conceit of him, and openly declared
the ſame by writing, let us conclude with <hi>Horace</hi>
in the eighth Ode of his fourth Book;
<q>Dignum Laudi cauſa vetat mori.</q>
               </p>

                  <hi>JOhn Lydgate</hi> was born in a Village of the ſame

(ſaith <hi>Cambden</hi>) though ſmall, yet in this reſpect

by the very Muſes themſelves: ſo brightly reſhine
in his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Verſes, all the pleaſant graces and

ſome time ſpent in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Univerſities, he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
through <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> improving his
time to his great accompliſhment, in learning the

Mathematician, an acute Philoſopher, and no

he became Tutor to many Noblemens Sons, and
both in Proſe and Poetry was the beſt Author
of his Age, for if <hi>Chaucer</hi>'s Coin were of greater
Weight for deeper Learning, <hi>Lydgate</hi>'s was of a
more refined Stantard for purer Language; ſo

was born (ſaith <hi>Bale</hi>) in the Northern parts,
and moſt likely in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> being an Eſquire of
an eminent Parentage. He was a man equally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to Arms and Arts, ſpending his Youth in
the one, and his Age in the other: His firſt Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59216:32"/>
Employment was under <hi>Robert Vmfreuil,</hi>
Governor of <hi>Roxborough</hi>-Caſtle, where he did good
Service againſt the <hi>Scots.</hi> Afterwards he followed
the Standard of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, to whom
he valiantly and faithfully adhered, not only in
the Sun-ſhine of his Proſperity, but alſo in his
deepeſt Diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>But what endeared him the moſt to his Favour,
and was indeed the Maſterpiece of his Service,
was his adventuring into <hi>Scotland;</hi> a deſperate At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
and performed not without the manifeſt
hazarding of his Life; where he ſo cunningly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaned
himſelf, and inſinuated himſelf ſo far into
their Favour, as he got a ſight of their Records
and Original Letters; a Copy of which he brought
with him to <hi>England,</hi> and preſented the ſame to
King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth: Out of theſe he collected
a Hiſtory of the ſeveral Submiſſions, and ſacred
Oaths of Fealty openly taken from the time of
King <hi>Athelstane,</hi> by the Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to the
Kings of <hi>England,</hi> for the Crown of <hi>Scotland;</hi> a
Work which was afterwards made much uſe of by
the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> although the <hi>Scotch</hi> Hiſtorians ſtickle
with might and main, that ſuch Homage was
performed only for the County of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and
ſome parcel of Land their Kings had in <hi>England</hi>
South of <hi>Tweed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as his Proſe was very uſeful, ſo was his
Poetry as much delightful; writing a Chronicle
of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Kings from <hi>Brute</hi> to King <hi>Edward</hi>
the Fourth, and that in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Verſe; for which
he was accounted one of the chiefeſt Poets of his
time; being ſo exactly done, that by it Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi>
adjudges him to have drunk as deep a draught of
<hi>Helicon,</hi> as any in his Age: And another ſaying,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59216:32"/>
that by the ſame he deſervedly claimed a Seat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

the Hawk, The Tunning of</hi> Elianer Rumpkin: In
many of which, following the humor of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enteſt

Liberty of being Satyrical upon the Clergy, as
brought him under the Laſh of Cardinal <hi>Woolſey,</hi>
who ſo perſecuted him, that he was forced to take
Sanctuary at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where Abbot <hi>Iſlip</hi> uſed

in his Time, of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and
with whom the Learned'ſt Foreigners of that Age,

Knight, and one of the Juſtices of the <hi>Kings Bench.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was bred firſt in the Family of Archbiſhop
<hi>Morton,</hi> then in <hi>Canterbury</hi>-Colledge in <hi>Oxford;</hi>
afterwards removed to an Inn of <hi>Chancery</hi> in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
called <hi>New-Inn,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Lincolns-Inn;</hi>
where he became a double Reader. Next,
his Worth preferred him to be Judge in the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59216:36"/>
of <hi>London</hi>'s Court, though at the ſame time a
Pleader in others; and ſo upright was he therein,
that he never undertook any Cauſe but what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
juſt to his Conſcience, nor never took
Fee of Widow, Orphan, or poor Perſon.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth coming to the Crown,
firſt Knighted him, then made him Chancellor of
the Duchy of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and not long after L. Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor

               <p>He was of ſuch excellency of Wit and Wiſdom,
that he was able to make his Fortune good in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever

of him, that when he was ſent Ambaſſador

he deliver'd his Embaſſage to the Emperor,
he bid one of his Servants to fill him a Beer-glaſs
of Wine, which he drunk off twice; commanding
his Servant to bring him a third; he knowing
Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi>'s Temperance, that he was not
uſed to drink, at firſt refuſed to fill him another;
telling Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> of the weight of his Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
but he commanding it, and his Servant not
daring to deny him, he drank off the third, and
then made his immediate addreſs to the Emperor,
and ſpake his Oration in <hi>Latine,</hi> to the admiration
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59216:37"/>
of all the Auditors. Afterwards Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
asking his Man what he thought of his Speech?
he ſaid, that he deſerved to govern three parts of
the World, and he believed if he had drunk the
other Glaſs, the Elegancy of his Language might
have purchaſed the other part of the World.</p>
               <p>Being once at <hi>Bruges</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> an arrogant
Fellow had ſet up a <hi>Theſis,</hi> that he would anſwer
any Queſtion could be propounded unto him in
what Art ſoever. Of whom, when Sir <hi>Thomas
More</hi> heard, he laughed, and made this Queſtion
to be put up for him to anſwer; Whether <hi>Averia
caepta in Withernamia ſunt irreplegibilia?</hi> Adding,,
That there was an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> that would diſpute
thereof with him. This bragging <hi>Thraſo,</hi> not ſo
much as underſtanding the Terms of our Common

ridiculous to the whole City for his preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous
bragging.</p>
               <p>Many were the Books which he wrote; amongſt
whom his <hi>Vtopi</hi> beareth the Bell; which though
not written in Verſe, yet in regard of the great

               <p>
                  <hi>THomas Churchyard</hi> was born in the Town of
<hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> as himſelf doth affirm in his
Book made in Verſe of the <hi>Worthineſs of Wales,</hi>
taking <hi>Shropſhire</hi> within the compaſs, (to uſe his
own Expreſſion) <hi>Wales</hi> the <hi>Park,</hi> and the <hi>Marches</hi>
the <hi>Pale</hi> thereof. He was one equally addicted to
Arts and Arms, ſerving under that renowned Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Sir <hi>William Drury,</hi> in a rode he made into
<hi>Scotland,</hi> as alſo under ſeveral other Commanders
beyond Sea, as he declares in his <hi>Tragical Diſcourſe
of the Unhappy Mans Life,</hi> ſaying,
<q>
                     <l>Full thirty years both Court and Wars I tryde,</l>
                     <l>And ſtill I ſought acquaintance with the beſt,</l>
                     <l>And ſerved the State, and did ſuch hap abide</l>
                     <l>As might befal, and Fortune ſent the reſt,</l>
                     <l>When Drum did ſound, I was a Soldier preſt</l>
                     <l>To Sea or Land, as Princes quarrel ſtood,</l>
                     <l>And for the ſame full oft I loſt my blood.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But it ſeems he got little by the Wars but
blows, as he declares himſelf a little after.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>But God he knows, my gain was ſmall I weene,
For though I did my credit ſtill encreaſe,
I got no wealth by wars, ne yet by peace.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Yet it ſeems he was born of wealthy friends, and
had an Eſtate left unto him, as in the ſame Work
he doth declare.

                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:59216:44"/>
                     <l>So born I was to Houſe and Land by right,</l>

                     <l>From <hi>Shrewsbury</hi>-Town, a ſeat of ancient fame.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Some conceive him to be as much beneath a Poet
as above a Rymer, yet who ſo ſhall conſider the
time he wrote in, <hi>viz.</hi> the beginning of the Reign
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſhall find his Verſes to go
abreaſt with the beſt of that Age. His Works,
ſuch as I have ſeen and have now in cuſtody, are as

wrote the Falls of <hi>Shore</hi>'s Wife and of Cardinal
<hi>Wolſey;</hi> which are inſerted into the Book of <hi>the
Mirrour for Magiſtrates.</hi> Thus, like a ſtone, did he
trundle about, but never gather'd any Moſs, dying
but poor, as may be ſeen by his Epitaph in
Mr. <hi>Cambden's Remains,</hi> which runs thus:
<q>

                        <hi>Poverty</hi> and <hi>Poetry</hi> his Tomb doth encloſe,</l>

                  </q>

               <p>His death, according to the moſt probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
may be preſumed about the eleventh year

               <p>
                  <hi>THomas Tuſſer</hi> (a perſon well known by his
Book of Husbandry) was born at <hi>Riuen-hall</hi>
in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> of an ancient Family, but now extinct;
where, when but young, his Father, deſigning him
for a Singing-man, put him to <hi>Wallingford</hi>-School,

                  <l>What bobbed lips, what yerks, what nips,
What helliſh toys?</l>
                  <l>What Robes ſo bare, what Colledge-fare?</l>
                  <l>What Bread how ſtale, what penny Ale?</l>

               </q>
               <p>From thence he was ſent to learn Muſick at <hi>Pauls,</hi>
with one <hi>John Redford,</hi> an excellent Muſician;
where, having attained ſome skill in that Art, he
was afterwards ſent to <hi>Eaton</hi>-School, to learn the
<hi>Latine</hi> Tongue, where, how his Miſeries encreas'd,
let himſelf ſpeak.</p>
               <q>

               </q>
               <p>Having attained to ſome perfection in the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
Tongue, he was ſent to <hi>Trinity-Hall</hi> in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>
where he had not continued long, but he
was vexed with extream ſickneſs, whereupon he
left the Univerſity, and betook himſelf to Court,
and lived for a while under the Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> in King
<hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's days; when, the Lords falling
at diſſention, he left the Court, and went to <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi>
where he married his firſt Wife, and took a
Farm at <hi>Ratwade</hi> in that County, where he firſt
deviſed his Book of Husbandry, but his Wife not
having her health there, he removed from thence
to <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> and ſoon after buried her.</p>
               <p>Not long after he married again to one Mrs. <hi>Amy
Moon,</hi> upon whoſe Name he thus verſified:
<q>
                     <l>I chanced ſoon to find a <hi>Moon,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Of chearful hue;</l>
                     <l>Which well and fine me thought did ſhine,</l>
                     <l>And never change, a thing moſt ſtrange,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Being thus married he betook himſelf again
to Husbandry, and hired a Farm, called <hi>Diram
Cell,</hi> and there he had not lived long, but his
Landlord died, and his Executors falling at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance,
and now one troubled him, and then
another, whereupon he left <hi>Diram,</hi> and went to

the Dean thereof; There he was troubled
with a <hi>Diſſury,</hi> ſo that in a 138 Hours he never
made a drop of Water. Next he hired a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage
at <hi>Fairſtead</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> but growing weary
of that he returned again to <hi>London,</hi> where he
had not lived long, but the Peſtilence raging
there, he retired to <hi>Cambridge:</hi> Thus did he
roul about from place to place, but, like <hi>Siſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
ſtone, could gather no Moſs whitherſoever
he went: He was ſucceſſive a Muſician, School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter,
Servingman, Husbandman, Graſier, Poet,
more skilful in all, than thriving in any Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He traded at large in Oxen, Sheep, Dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
Grain of all kinds, to no profit. He
ſpread his Bread with all ſorts of Butter, yet
none would ſtick thereon. So that he might ſay
with the Poet,
<q>—<hi>Monitis ſum minor ipſe meis.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>

at the <hi>Practice</hi> of Husbandry, and may be fitly
match'd with <hi>Thomas Churchyard,</hi> they being
mark'd alike in their Poetical parts, living in
the ſame time, and ſtatur'd both alike in their
Eſtates, and that low enough in all reaſon. He
died in <hi>London, Anno Dom.</hi> 1580. and was buried
at St. <hi>Mildred</hi>'s-Church in the <hi>Poultrey,</hi> with this
Epitaph:

was by Birth a Gentleman, and ſent to ſtudy in the

of the Fountain of <hi>Hellicon,</hi> but drank deeper

writing much againſt Viciouſneſs, but too too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
in his Life. He had to his Wife a
Virtuous Gentlewoman, whom yet he forſook,
and betook himſelf to a high courſe of Living;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59216:50"/>
to maintain which, he made his Pen mercenary,
making his Name very famous for ſeveral Books

he fell into extream Poverty, when his Friends,
(like Leaves to Trees in the Summer of Proſperity)
fell from him in his Winter of Adverſity: of which
he was very ſenſible, and heartily repented of his
ill paſſed Life, eſpecially of the wrongs he had
done to his Wife; which he declared in a Letter
written to her, and found with his Book of <hi>A

Thee and thy unreproved Vertues, add greater
ſorrow to my miſerable State than I can utter, or thou

Being in this extremity, as void of help, as thou haſt
been of hope. Reaſon would that after ſo long waſte, I

I know; that thou canſt forget my Injuries, I hardly
believe; yet I perſwade my ſelf, if thou ſaweſt my
wretched eſtate, thou couldſt not but lament it: Nay,
certainly I know thou wouldſt. All my wrongs muſter

For my contempt of God, I am Contemned of Men; for
my ſwearing and forſwearing, no man will believe me;
for my Gluttony I ſuffer Hunger; for my Drunkenneſs
Thirſt; for my Adultery, ulcerous Sores: Thus God
hath caſt me down that I might be humbled, and puniſht
me for example of others; and though he ſuffers me in

               <p>SIr <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> the glory of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in his time, and pattern of true Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
in whom the Graces and Muſes had their
domeſtical habitations, equally addicted both to
Arts and Arms, though more fortunate in the one
than in the other. Son to Sir <hi>Henry Sidney,</hi> thrice
Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Siſters Son to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
Earl of <hi>Leiceſter;</hi> Bred in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Church in
<hi>Oxford, (Cambridge</hi> being nevertheleſs ſo happy
to have a Colledge of his name) where he ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
in the Arts and Liberal Sciences, that after
an incredible proficiency in all the Species of
Learning, he left the Academical Life, for that
of the Court, invited thither by his Uncle, the
Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> that great Favourite of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Here he ſo profited, that he became
the glorious Star of his Family, a lively Pattern
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59216:53"/>
of Vertue, and the lovely Joy of all the learned
ſort. Theſe his Parts ſo indeared him to Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that ſhe ſent him upon an Embaſſy to
the Emperor of <hi>Germany</hi> at <hi>Vienna,</hi> which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
to his own Honour, and her Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Yea, his Fame was ſo renowned through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all Chriſtendom, that (as it is commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported)
he was in election for the Kingdom of
<hi>Poland,</hi> though the Author of his Life, printed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his <hi>Arcadia,</hi> doth doubt of the truth of it,
however it was not above his deſerts.</p>
               <p>During his abode at the Court, at his ſpare
hours he compoſed that incomparable Romance,
entituled, <hi>The Arcadia,</hi> which he dedicated to his
Siſter the Counteſs of <hi>Pembroke.</hi> A Book (ſaith
Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>) which, beſides its excellent Language,
rare Contrivances, and delectable Stories, hath
in it all the ſtrains of Poeſie, comprehendeth the
whole art of ſpeaking, and to them who can
diſcern and will obſerve, affordeth notable Rules
of Demeanour, both private and publick; and
though ſome men, ſharp-witted only in ſpeaking
evil, have depraved the Book, as the occaſion
that many precious hours are ſpent no better, they
conſider not that the ready way to make the minds
of Youth grow awry, is to lace them too hard,
by denying them juſt and due liberty. Surely
(ſaith one) the Soul deprived of lawful delights,
will, in way of revenge, (to enlarge its ſelf out
of priſon) invade and attempt unlawful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.
Let ſuch be condemned always to eat their
meat with no other ſawce, but their own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,

               <p>He wrote alſo beſides his <hi>Arcadia,</hi> ſeveral other
Works; namely, <hi>A Defence of Poeſie,</hi> a Book en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled
<hi>Aſtrophel</hi> and <hi>Stella,</hi> with divers Songs and
Sonnets in praiſe of his Lady, whom he celebrated
under that bright Name; whom afterwards he
married, that Paragon of Nature, Sir <hi>Francis
Walſingham</hi>'s Daughter, who impoveriſhed himſelf
to enrich the State; from whom he expected no
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59216:54"/>
more than what was above all Portions, a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Wife, and a virtuous Daughter.</p>
               <p>He alſo tranſlated part of that excellent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
of <hi>Philip Morney du Pleſſis,</hi> of the Truth of
Religion; and no doubt had written many other
excellent Works, had not the Lamp of his Life
been extinguiſh'd too ſoon; the manner whereof
take as followeth:</p>
               <p>His Unkle <hi>Robert Dudley</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> (a
man almoſt as much hated as his Nephew was lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
was ſent over into the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> with a
well appointed Army, and large Commiſſion, to
defend the <hi>United Provinces</hi> againſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.
Under him went Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> who had
the Command of the cautionary Town of <hi>Fluſhing,</hi>
and Caſtle of <hi>Ramekius,</hi> a Truſt which he ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
diſcharged, that he turned the Envy of the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Townſmen into Affection and Admiration.
Not long after, ſome Service was to be performed
nigh <hi>Zutphen</hi> in <hi>Guelderland,</hi> where the <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
through falſe intelligence, were miſtaken in the
ſtrength of the Enemy. Sir <hi>Philip</hi> is employed next
to the Chief in that Expedition; which he ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged,
that it is queſtionable whether his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Induſtry or Valour may challenge to it ſelf
the greateſt praiſe of the Action. And now when
the triumphant Lawrels were ready to Crown his
Brows, the <hi>English</hi> ſo near the Victory, that they
touched it, ready to lay hold upon, he was unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately
ſhot in the Thigh, which is the Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz
of Nerves and Sinews, which cauſed a Feaver,

be therefore born into the world even to ſhew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

<hi>Heylin</hi> in his <hi>Coſmography</hi> calleth him, That gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
Gentleman of whom he cannot but make ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
mention. Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> in his <hi>Worthies</hi> thus
writes of him, His homebred Abilities perfected
by Travel with foreign accompliſhments, and a
ſweet Nature, ſet a gloſs upon both. <hi>Stow</hi> in his
<hi>Annals,</hi> calleth him, a moſt valiant and towardly
Gentleman. <hi>Speed</hi> in his Chronicle, That worthy
Gentleman in whom were compleat all Virtues
and Valours that could be expected to reſide in
man: And Sir <hi>Richard Baker</hi> gives him this Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter,
A man of ſo many excellent parts of Art and
Nature, of Valour and Learning, of Wit and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59216:55"/>
Magnanimity, that as he had equalled all thoſe of
former Ages, ſo the future will hardly be able to
equal him.</p>

               <p>NExt to Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> we ſhall add his
great Friend and Aſſociate, Sir <hi>Fulk Grevil,</hi>
Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> one very eminent both for Arts
and Arms; to which the <hi>genius</hi> of that time did
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59216:56"/>
mightily invite active Spirits. This Noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
for the great love he bore to Sir <hi>Philip sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
wrote his Life. He wrote ſeveral other
Works both in Proſe and Verſe, ſome of which
were Dramatick, as his Tragedies of <hi>Alaham,
Muſtapha,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Tullius Cicero,</hi> and others,
commonly of a Political Subject; amongſt which,
a Poſthume Work, not publiſh'd till within a few
years, being a two fold Treatiſe, the firſt of
Monarchy, the ſecond of Religion, in all which
is obſervable a cloſe myſterious and ſententious
way of Writing, without much regard to Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy
of Stile, or ſmoothneſs of Verſe. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Poſthume Book is alſo fathered upon him;
namely, <hi>The Five Years of King</hi> James, <hi>or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

had to other Provinces,</hi> Printed in the Year 1643.
But of this laſt Work many people are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p>Now for his Abilities in the Exerciſe of Arms,
take this inſtance: At ſuch time when the <hi>French</hi>

a Marriage between the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi>

               <head>Mr. EDMOND SPENSER.</head>
               <p>THis our Famous Poet, Mr. <hi>Edmond Spenſer,</hi>
was born in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and
brought up in <hi>Pembroke-Hall</hi> in <hi>Cambridge;</hi> where
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59216:57"/>
he became a moſt excellent Scholar, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
very happy in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poetry, as his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
elaborate Works do declare, which whoſo
ſhall peruſe with a judicious eye, will find to
have in them the very height of Poetick fancy,
and though ſome blame his Writings for the
many <hi>Chauceriſms</hi> uſed by him, yet to the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
they are known not to be blemiſhes, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
beauties to his Book; which, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
(ſaith a learned Writer) had been more
ſalable, if more conformed to our modern lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
               <p>His firſt flight in Poetry, as not thinking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
fully fledged, was in that Book of his, called
<hi>The Shepherds Kalendar,</hi> applying an old Name
to a new Book; It being of Eclogues fitted to
each Month in the Year: of which Work hear
what that worthy Knight, Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> writes,
whoſe judgment in ſuch caſes is counted infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible:
<hi>The Shepherds Kalendar</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath much
Poetry in his Eclogues, indeed worthy the reading,
if I be not deceived; That ſame framing his Stile to
an old ruſtick Language, I dare not allow, ſince nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
Theocritus <hi>in</hi> Greek, Virgil <hi>in</hi> Latine, <hi>nor</hi>
Sanazara <hi>in</hi> Italian <hi>did effect it.</hi> Afterwards he
tranſlated the <hi>Gnat,</hi> a little fragment of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>'s
excellency. Then he tranſlated <hi>Bellay</hi> his
Ruins of <hi>Rome;</hi> His moſt unfortunate Work was
that of <hi>Mother Hubbard's Tale,</hi> giving therein
offence to one in authority, who after wards ſtuck
on his skirts. But his main Book, and which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
I think Envy its ſelf cannot carp at, was his
<hi>Fairy Queen,</hi> a Work of ſuch an ingenious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure
as will laſt as long as time endures.</p>

               <p>There paſſeth a ſtory commonly told and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
that Mr. <hi>Spenſer</hi> preſenting his Poems to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59216:58"/>
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſhe highly affected therewith,
commanded the Lord <hi>Cecil,</hi> her Treaſurer, to give
him an Hundred Pound; and when the Treaſurer
(a good Steward of the Queen's Money) alledged,
that Sum was too much for ſuch a matter; then
give him, quoth the Queen, <hi>what is reaſon;</hi> but
was ſo buſied, or ſeemed to be ſo, about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of higher concernment, that Mr. <hi>Spenſer</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
no reward: whereupon he preſented this
Petition in a ſmall piece of Paper to the Queen in
her progreſs.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>I was promis'd on a time,</l>
                  <l>To have reaſon for my rime,</l>
                  <l>From that time unto this ſeaſon,</l>
                  <l>I receiv'd nor rime nor reaſon.</l>
               </q>
               <p>This tart reflect ſo wrought upon the Queen,
that ſhe gave ſtrict order (not witſtout ſome check
to her Treaſurer) for the preſent payment of the
hundred pounds ſhe firſt intended him.</p>
               <p>He afterwards went over into <hi>Ireland,</hi> Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
to the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> Lord Deputy thereof;
and though that his Office under his Lord was
lucrative, yet got he no Eſtate; <hi>Peculiari Poetis
fato ſemper cum paupertate conflictatus est,</hi> ſaith the
reverend <hi>Cambden;</hi> ſo that it fared little better
with him, (than with <hi>Churchyard</hi> or <hi>Tuſſer</hi> before
him) or with <hi>William Xiliander</hi> the <hi>German,</hi> (a moſt

               <p>Thriving ſo bad in that boggy Country, to add

returns into <hi>England,</hi> and falling into want, which

               <p>A modern Author writes, that the Lord <hi>Cecil</hi>
owed Mr. <hi>Spenſer</hi> a grudge for ſome Reflections of
his in <hi>Mother Hubbard's Tale,</hi> and therefore when
the Queen had order'd him that Money, the Lord
Treaſurer ſaid, What all this for a Song? And
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59216:59"/>
this he is ſaid to have taken ſo much to heart, that
he contracted a deep Melancholy, which ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
brought his life to a period: ſo apt is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
ſpirit to reſent a ſlighting even from the
greateſt perſons. And thus much I muſt needs ſay
of the Merit of ſo great a Poet, from ſo great a
Monarch, that it is incident to the beſt of Poets
ſometimes to flatter ſome Royal or Noble Patron,
never did any do it more to the height, or with
greater art and elegance, if the higheſt of praiſes
attributed to ſo Heroick a Princeſs can juſtly be
termed flattery.</p>

               <p>SIr <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> a Knight and Wit, was
Son to Sir <hi>Nicholas Overbury</hi> of <hi>Burton</hi> in <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter-ſhire,</hi>
one of the Judges of the Marches; who,
to his natural propenſion of ingenuity, had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of good Education, being bred up firſt in
<hi>Oxford,</hi> afterwards, for a while a Student of the
Law in the <hi>Middle Temple;</hi> ſoon after he caſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
at Court, the Haven of Hope for all aſpiring
Spirits; afterwards travell'd into <hi>France,</hi> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been ſome time, he returned again, and was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
into the reſpects of Sir <hi>Rob. Carre,</hi> one who
was newly initiated a Favourite to King <hi>James;</hi>
where, by his wiſe carriage, he purchaſed to himſelf
not only the good affection and reſpect of Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
but alſo of divers other eminent perſons.</p>
               <p>During his abode with Sir <hi>Robert Carre,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
that excellent Poem of his, entituled, <hi>A Wife;</hi>
which, for the excellency thereof, the Author of the
Epiſtle to the Reader, prefixed before his Book, thus
writes, <hi>Had ſuch a Poem been extant among the ancient</hi>
Romans, <hi>altho' they wanted our eaſie conſervation of Wit
by Printing, they would have committed it to Braſs, leſt
injurious time might deprive it of due eternity.</hi> Nor was
his Poem of <hi>A Wife</hi> not only done to the life, but
alſo thoſe Characters which he wrote, to this day
not out-witted by any.</p>
               <p>But to return from the Work to the Workman;
Mr. <hi>Overbury</hi> is by the King knighted, and Sir <hi>Rob.
Carre</hi> made a Viſcount, and ſuch a reciprocal Love
paſs'd betwixt them, that it was queſtionable, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59216:64"/>
the Viſcount were more in favour with King
<hi>James,</hi> or Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> in the favour of the
Viſcount? But what eſtate on earth is ſo firm, that
is not changeable, or what friendſhip is ſo conſtant,
that is not diſſolvable? Who would imagine this
Viſcount ſhould be inſtrumental to his death, who
had done him ſo faithful ſervice, and to whom he
had emboſom'd his moſt ſecret thoughts? Yet ſo it
was, for Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> out of an unfeigned affection
which he bare to the Viſcount, diſwaded him from
a motion of a Marriage which was propounded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and the Lady <hi>Francis Howard,</hi> who was
lately divorced from the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> as a Match
neither for his credit here, nor comfort hereafter.
This Counſel, though it proceeded from an unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
love in Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> yet where Beauty commands,
all diſcretion being ſequeſtred, created in the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
a hatred towards him; and in the Counteſs
the fury of a woman, a deſire of revenge, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
the Viſcount, <hi>That it was not poſſible that ever
ſhe ſhould endure thoſe injuries, or hope for any proſperity
ſo long as he lived; That ſhe wondred how he could be ſo
familiar, ſo much affected to his man</hi> Overbury; <hi>that
without him he could do nothing, at it were making him
his right hand, ſeeing he being newly grown into the
Kings favour, and depending wholly upon his greatneſs,
must expect to be clouded if not ruined, when his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
that knew his ſecrets ſhould come to preferment.</hi>
The Viſcount, apt enough of his own inclination to
revenge, being thus further exaſperated by the
Counteſs, they joyntly reſolve upon his death, and
ſoon a fit opportunity came to their hands. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by King <hi>James</hi> (and as it is thought by the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count's
Counſel) nominated to be ſent Embaſſador
to the Emperor of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> was by the ſaid Viſcount,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59216:64"/>
whom he eſpecially truſted, perſuaded to decline the
employment, as no better than an <hi>honourable Grave;</hi>
Better lie ſome days in the <hi>Tower,</hi> than more months
in a worſe Priſon; a Ship by Sea, and a barbarous
cold Country by Land. <hi>You are now</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>in
credit at home, and have made tryal of the dangers of
travel, why then ſhould you hazard all upon uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
being already in poſſeſſion of that you can probably
expect by theſe means;</hi> promiſing him, that within a
ſmall time he would ſo work with the King, that he
ſhould have a good of opinion him. But he (ſaith
Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi>) who willingly goes into a Priſon out of
hope to come eaſily out of it, may ſtay therein ſo
long till he be too late convinced of his error.</p>
               <p>And now having him in the place where they
would, their next ſtudy to ſecure their revenge,
was cloſely to make him away; which they conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be by poyſon. To this end, they conſult
with one Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> (the firſt inventer of that
horrid Garb of yellow Ruffs and Cuffs, and in
which Garb ſhe was after hanged) ſhe having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with one <hi>James Franklin,</hi> a man skilled
for that purpoſe, agreed with him to provide that
which ſhould not kill preſently, but cauſe one to
languiſh away by degrees, a little and a little. Sir
<hi>Gervas Yelvis,</hi> Lieutenant of the Tower, being
drawn into the Conſpiracy, admits one <hi>Weſton,</hi> Mrs.
<hi>Turners</hi> man, who under pretence of waiting upon
Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> was to act the horrid Tragedy. The
Plot thus continued, <hi>Franklin</hi> buyes certain Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<hi>viz. Soſater, white Arſenick, Mercury ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
Cantharides,</hi> red <hi>Mercury,</hi> with three or four
other deadly Ingredients, which he delivered to
<hi>Weſton,</hi> with inſtructions how to uſe them. <hi>Weſton,</hi>
(an apt Scholar in the Devil's School) tempers
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59216:65"/>
them in his Broth and Meat, increaſing or diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their ſtrength according as he ſaw him affected.
Beſides theſe, poyſon'd Tarts &amp; Jellies are ſent him
by the Viſcount. Nay, they poyſoned his very Salt,
Sauce, Meat and Drink; but being of a very ſtrong
Conſtitution, he held out ſtill: At laſt they effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their work by a poyſoned Clyſter which they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſted
unto him, ſo that the next day he died
thereof; and becauſe there were ſome Bliſters and
ugly Botches on his Body, the Conſpirators gave
it out he died of the <hi>French Pox.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus by the Malice of a Woman this worthy
Knight was murdered, who yet ſtill lives in that
witty Poem of his, entituled, <hi>a Wife;</hi> as is well
expreſſed by theſe Verſes under his Picture.</p>
               <l>A man's beſt Fortune, or his worſt's a Wife:</l>
               <l>Yet I that knew no Marriage, Peace, nor Strife,</l>
               <l>Live by a good one, by a bad one loſt my Life.</l>
               <p>But God, who ſeldom ſuffers Murder to go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revenged,
revealed the ſame; for notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what the Conſpirators had given out, Suſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
grew high that Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was poyſoned:
Whereupon <hi>Weſton</hi> is examined by the Lord <hi>Cook,</hi>
who at firſt ſtifly denied the ſame; but being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
by the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> he tells all: How
Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> and the Counteſs came acquainted;
what relation ſhe had, to Witches, Sorcerers and
Conjurers; and diſcovers all thoſe who had any
hand in it: whereupon they were all apprehended;
ſome ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> others to <hi>Newgate.</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thus confeſſed, being convicted according to
courſe of Law, he was hanged at <hi>Tyburn;</hi> after
him Mrs. <hi>Turner;</hi> after her <hi>Franklin,</hi> then Sir <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59216:65"/>
Yelvis,</hi> upon their ſeveral Arraignments, were
found guilty, and executed. Some of them died
very penitent: The Earl and his Counteſs were
both condemned, but through the King's gracious
Pardon had their Lives ſaved, but were never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Favour of the Court.</p>

this of his <hi>Poly-Olbion,</hi> becauſe of the old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſhion'd
kind of Verſe thereof, which ſeems ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to diminiſh that reſpect which was formerly
paid to the Subject, although indeed both pleaſant
and elaborate, wherein he took a great deal both
of ſtudy and pains; and thereupon thought worthy
to be commented upon by that once walking Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary
of our Nation, Mr. <hi>John Selden:</hi> His <hi>Barons
Wars</hi> are done to the Life, equal to any of that
Subject. His <hi>Englands Heroical Epiſtles</hi> generally
liked and received, entituling him unto the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the <hi>Engliſh Ovid.</hi> His Legends of <hi>Robert</hi>
Duke of <hi>Normandy. Matilda, Pierce Gaveſton,</hi> and
<hi>Thomas Cromwel,</hi> all of them done to the Life. His
<hi>Idea</hi> expreſſes much Fancy and Poetry. And to ſuch
as love that Poetry, that of <hi>Nymphs,</hi> and <hi>Shepherds,</hi>
his <hi>Nymphals,</hi> and other things of that nature,
cannot be unpleaſant.</p>
               <p>To conclude, He was a Poet of a pious temper,
his Conſcience having always the command of his
Fancy; very temperate in his Life, ſlow of ſpeech,
and inoffenſive in company. He changed his Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
for a Crown of Glory, <hi>Anno,</hi> 1631. and was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in <hi>Westminſter-Abbey,</hi> near the South-door, by

               <p>THis <hi>renowned Poet,</hi> whoſe Fame ſurmounts all the

where ſhe married a <hi>Bricklayer</hi> for her ſecond

               <p>Under this <hi>learned Schoolmaſter</hi> he attained to

in St. <hi>John</hi>'s-Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> (as many
years after incorporated a honorary Member of
<hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> in <hi>Oxford</hi>) here he ſtaid but ſome
ſmall time, for want of maintainance; for if there
be no Oyl in the Lamp, it will ſoon be extinguiſh'd:
And now, as if he had quite laid aſide all thoughts of
the Univerſity, he betook himſelf to the Trade of
his Father-in-law; And let not any be offended here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
ſince it is more commendable to work in a
lawful Calling, then having one not to uſe it. He
was one who helped in the building of the new
Structure of <hi>Lincolns-Inn,</hi> where, having a Trowel
in his hand, he had a Book in his pocket, that as his
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59216:75"/>
work went forward, ſo his ſtudy went not backward.</p>
               <p>But ſuch <hi>rare Parts</hi> as he had could be no more
hid, than the Sun in a ſerene day, ſome Gentlemen
pitying ſuch rare Endowments ſhould be buried
under the rubbiſh of ſo mean a Calling, did by their
bounty manumiſe him freely to follow his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
inclinations. Indeed his Parts were not ſo
ready to run of themſelves, as able to anſwer the
ſpur; ſo that it may be truly ſaid of him, that he
had an elaborate wit wrought out by his own indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry;
yet were his Repartees for the moſt part
very quick and ſmart, and which ſavour'd much of
ingenuity, of which I ſhall give you two inſtances.</p>
               <p>He having been drinking in an upper room, at the
<hi>Feathers</hi>-Tavern in <hi>Cheap ſide,</hi> as he was coming
down ſtairs, his foot ſlipping, he caught a fall, and
tumbling againſt a door, beat it open into a room
where ſome Gentlemen were drinking <hi>Canary;</hi> reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
his feet, he ſaid, <hi>Gentlemen, ſince I am ſo luckily
fallen into your company, I will drink with you before I go.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He uſed very mach to frequent the <hi>Half-Moon</hi>-Tavern
in <hi>Alderſgate-ſtreet,</hi> through which was a
common <hi>Thorough fare;</hi> he coming late that way;
one night, was denied paſſage, whereupon going
through the <hi>Sun</hi>-Tavern a little after, he ſaid,
<q>Since that the <hi>Moon</hi> was ſo unkind to make me go about,
The <hi>Sun</hi> henceforth ſhall take my Coin, the <hi>Moon</hi> ſhall
go without.</q>
               </p>
               <p>His conſtant humour was to ſit ſilent in learned

               <p>He was one, and the chief of them, in uſhering

               <p>He was paramount in the Dramatick part of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and taught the Stage an exact conformity to
the Laws of Comedians, being accounted the moſt
learned, judicious, and correct of them all; and the
more to be admired for being ſo, for that neither
the height of natural parts, for he was no <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi>
nor the coſt of extraordinary education, but his own
proper induſtry, and addiction to Books, advanced
him to this perfection. He wrote fifty Plays in all,
whereof fifteen Comedies, three Tragedies, the reſt
Maſques and Entertainments. His comedies were,

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59216:76"/>
Sad Shepherd, Silent Woman,</hi> and <hi>A Tale of a Tub.</hi>
His Tragedies were, <hi>Cateline's Conſpiracy, Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's
Fall,</hi> and <hi>Scianus.</hi> His Maſques and Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
too long here to write, were thirty and
two, beſides a Comedy of <hi>Eaſt-ward, hoe?</hi> in which
he was Partner with <hi>Chapman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe his Plays were above the vulgar capacity,
(which are onely tickled with down-right obſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity)
and took not ſo well at the firſt <hi>ſtroke,</hi> as at the
<hi>rebound,</hi> when beheld the ſecond time, yea, they will
endure reading, and that with due commendation,
ſo long as either ingenuity or learning are faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in our Nation. And although all his Plays may
endure the teſt, yet in three of his Comedies, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>The Fox, Alchymist,</hi> and <hi>Silent Woman,</hi> he may
be compared in the judgment of the learned men,
for <hi>decorum, language</hi> and <hi>well-humouring</hi> parts, as
well with the chief of the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi>
Comedians, as the prime of modern <hi>Italians,</hi> who
have been judged the beſt of <hi>Europe</hi> for happy
vein in Comedies; not is his <hi>Bartholomew-Fair</hi> much
ſhort of them. As for his other Comedies, <hi>Staple
of News, Devil's an Aſs,</hi> and the reſt, if they be not
ſo ſprightful and vigorous as his firſt pieces, all
that are old will, and all that deſire to be old, ſhould
excuſe him therein; and therefore let the Name of
<hi>Ben Johnſon</hi> ſheild them againſt whoever ſhall think
fit to be ſrvere in cenſure againſt them. Truth is,
his Tragedies, <hi>Seianus</hi> and <hi>Cateline</hi> ſeem to have in
them more of an artificial and inflate, than of a
pathetical and naturally Tragick height; yet do
they every one of them far excel any of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
ones that were writ before him; ſo that he may be
truly ſaid to be the firſt reformer of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Stage, as he himſelf more truly than modeſtly writes
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59216:76"/>
in his commendatory Verſes of his Servants <hi>Richard
Broom</hi>'s Comedy of the <hi>Northern Laſs.</hi>

               <l>Which you have juſtly gained from the Stage,</l>

               <l>Which I, your Maſter, firſt did teach the Age.</l>
               <p>In the reſt of his Poetry, (for he is not wholly
Dramatick) as his <hi>Vnderwoods, Epigrams,</hi> &amp;c. he is
ſometimes bold and ſtrenuous, ſometimes Magiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
ſometimes lepid and full enough of conceit,
and ſometimes a man as other men are.</p>
               <p>It ſeems the iſſue of his brain was more lively
and laſting than the iſſue of his body, having ſeveral
Children, yet none living to ſurvive him; This he
beſtowed as part as an Epitaph on his eldeſt Son,
dying an Infant.</p>

in his learned Words, yet his Body, ſubject to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
left this life, <hi>Anno</hi> 1638. and was buried

Stage (and ſo much the more eminent, that
he gained great applauſe and commendation, when
able Wits were his Contemporaries) was born at
<hi>Stratford</hi> upon <hi>Avon</hi> in <hi>Warwickshire,</hi> and is the
higheſt honour that Town can boaſt of. He was
one of the <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> who from Actors, became
Makers of Comedies and Tragedies, <hi>viz. Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
Marlow</hi> before him, and Mr. <hi>John Lacy,</hi> ſince
his time, and one in whom three eminent Poets
may ſeem in ſome ſort to the compounded. 1. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,</hi>
in the warlike ſound of his Sirname, <hi>Haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vibrans,</hi>
or <hi>Shakeſpear;</hi> whence ſome have ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

confeſs himſelf; but by keeping company with
Learned perſons, and converſing with jocular
Wits, whereto he was naturally inclin'd, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
ſo famouſly witty, or wittily famous, that
by his own induſtry, without the help of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he attained to an extraordinary height<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in all
ſtrains of Dramatick Poetry, eſpecially in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick
part, wherein we may ſay he outwent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
yet was he not ſo much given to Feſtivity,
but that he could (when ſo diſpoſed) be ſolemn

to ſmile at his Comedies, they were ſo merry,
and <hi>Democritus</hi> ſcarce forbear to ſigh at his Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
they were ſo mournful.</p>
               <p>Nor were his Studies altogether confined to the

witneſs his Poem of the <hi>Rape of Lucrece,</hi> and

the quickneſs of his Wit and Invention. His Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory

contemporary with <hi>William Shakeſpear,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
like him, roſe from an Actor, to be a maker of
Comedies and Tragedies, yet was he much inferior
to <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> not only in the number of his Plays,
but alſo in the elegancy of his Style. His Pen was
chiefly employ'd in Tragedies; namely, his <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain</hi>
the firſt and ſecond Part, <hi>Edward</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
<hi>Luſt's Dominion,</hi> or <hi>the Laſcivious Queen,</hi> the
<hi>Maſſacre of</hi> Paris, his <hi>Jew of</hi> Malta, a Tragi-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
and his Tragedy of <hi>Dido,</hi> in which he was
joyned with <hi>Naſh.</hi> But none made ſuch a great
Noiſe as this Comedy of <hi>Doctor Fauſtus</hi> with his
Devils, and ſuch like tragical Sport, which pleaſed
much the humors of the Vulgar. He alſo begun a
Poem of <hi>Hero,</hi> and <hi>Leander;</hi> wherein he ſeemed to
have a reſemblance of that clear and unſophiſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Wit which was natural to <hi>Muſaeus</hi> that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
Poet. This Poem being left unfiniſhed by
<hi>Marlow,</hi> who in ſome riotous Fray came to an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
and violent end, was thought worthy of
the finiſhing hand of <hi>Chapman,</hi> as we intimated

that he might be called the Tranſlator General of

into Engliſh, are ſufficient to make a Country
Gentleman a Competent Library for Hiſtorians.
He is thought to have his Birth in <hi>Warwick-ſhire,</hi>
but more certain to have his Breeding in <hi>Trinity
Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge;</hi> where he ſo Profited, that
he became Doctor of Phyſick: and practiſed the

               <p>Now as he was a Tranſlator of many Authors, ſo

commended him moſt in the Praiſe of Poſterity,
was his Tranſlating <hi>Cambdens Britania,</hi> a Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
more then a Tranſlation: he adding to it
many more notes then what were firſt in the Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin

Authenticalneſs with what was ſet forth by Mr.

               <p>Some of theſe Books (not withſtanding their

<hi>The Purple Iſland,</hi> of which to give my Reader a

agreed; and driving it home, would have his

               <l>The Saints Monopoly, the zealous Cluſter,</l>
               <l>Which like a Porcupine preſents a Muſter.</l>
               <p>Thus he ſhined with equal Light and Influence,
until that great defection of Loyalty over-ſpread
the Land, and Rebellion began to unvizaard it ſelf;
of which no Man had more ſagacious Prognoſticks,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59216:100"/>
of which take this one-inſtance; when <hi>Oliver
Cromwell</hi> was in Election to be Burgeſs for the
Town of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> as he ingaged all his Friends
and Intereſts to oppoſe it; ſo when it was paſſed, he
ſaid with much paſſionate zeal, <hi>That ſingle vote ruined
both Church and Kingdom;</hi> ſuch fatal events did he
preſage from his bloody Beak: For no ſooner did
that <hi>Harpey</hi> appear in the Univerſity, but he made
good what was predicted of him, and he amongſt
others, that were outed for their Loyalty, was
turned out of his Fellowſhip at St. <hi>Johns;</hi> out
of which Loyal Colledge was then ejected Dr.
<hi>Beal</hi> the Maſter, thirteen Batchellors of Divinity,
and fourteen Maſters of Art, beſides Mr. <hi>Cleve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now being forced from the Colledge, he
betook himſelf to the Camp, and particularly to
<hi>Oxford</hi> the Head quarter of it, as the moſt proper
and proportionate Sphere for his Wit, Learning,
and Loyalty; and added ſmall Luſtre to that
famous Univerſity, with which it ſhined before.</p>
               <p>Here he managed his Pen as the higheſt Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyriſt
(witneſs his <hi>Rupertiſmus,</hi> his Elegy on the
Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> &amp;c.) on the one ſide to
draw out all good inclinations to vertue: and
the ſmartiſt Satyriſt, exemplifi'd in the <hi>Rebel
Scot,</hi> the <hi>Scots Apoſtacy,</hi> which he preſented with
ſuch a Satyrical Fury, that the whole Nation fares
the worſe for it, lying under a moſt grievous Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Cenſure. Such alſo were his Poem of <hi>The
mixt Aſſembly,</hi> his Character of a <hi>London</hi> Diurnal,
and a <hi>Committee-Man;</hi> Blows that ſhakes triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rebellion, reaching the Souls of thoſe not to
be reached by Law or Power, ſtriking each Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to a Paleneſs, beyond that of any Loyal Corps,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59216:101"/>
that bled by them; ſuch Characters being as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delible
as Guilt ſtabs beyond Death.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Oxford,</hi> his next ſtage was the Garriſon of
<hi>Newark,</hi> where he was Judge Advocate until the
Surrender thereof; and by an excellent temperature
of both, was a juſt and prudent Judge for the
King, and a faithful Advocate for the Country.
Here he drew up that excellent Anſwer and Rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to a Parliament Officer, who had ſent him a
Letter by occaſion of one <hi>Hill,</hi> that had deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the ſum of <hi>133l.</hi> and <hi>8d.</hi> I ſhall only give you

Man, or in the Son of Man. Did not <hi>Demas</hi> leave
<hi>Paul,</hi> did not <hi>Oneſimus</hi> run from his Maſter <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon?</hi>
Alſo this ſhould teach us to employ our Talents,
and not to lay them up in a Napkin; had it been done
among the Cavaliers, it had been juſt, then the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite</hi>
had ſpoiled the <hi>Aegyptian:</hi> but for <hi>Simeon</hi> to
plunder <hi>Levi,</hi> that—<hi>that</hi>—&amp;c.</p>
               <p>This famous Garriſon was maintained with
much courage and reſolution againſt the Beſiegers,
and not ſurrendred but by the King's ſpecial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
when firſt he had ſurrendred himſelf into
the hands of the <hi>Scots;</hi> in which action of that
Royal Martyr, we may conclude our <hi>Cleveland
Vates,</hi> both Poet and Prophet: For beſides his
paſſionate reſentment of it in that excellent Poem,
<hi>the Kings diſguiſe;</hi> upon ſome private intelligence,
three days before the King reached them, he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw
the pieces of Silver paying upon the banks of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59216:101"/>
                  <hi>Tweed,</hi> and that they were the price of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns
Blood, and predicted the Tragical events.</p>
               <p>Thenceforth he followed the fate of diſtreſſed
Loyalty, ſubject to the Malice and Vengeance of
every Fanatick Spirit, which ſeldom terminates
but in a Goal, which befel this learned Perſon,
being long impriſoned at <hi>Yarmouth;</hi> where living
in a lingering Condition, and having ſmall hopes
of coming out, he compoſed an Addreſs to that
Idol at <hi>White-Hall, Oliver Cromwell,</hi> written with
ſuch Tow'ring Language, and ſo much gallant Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
as looked bigger than his Highneſs, ſhrinking
before the Majeſty of his Pen, as <hi>Felix</hi> trembled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Paul.</hi> So obtaining his Liberty, not by a ſervile
Submiſſion, but rather a conſtrained Violence, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
injuring his Conſcience, nor betraying his
Cauſe.</p>
               <p>And ſo now with <hi>Daniel</hi> being delivered out of
the Lyons Den, he was courted to ſeveral places,
(which contended as emulouſly for his abode, as the
ſeven <hi>Grecian</hi> Cities for <hi>Homers</hi> Birth;) at laſt he
ſetled in <hi>Grays-Inn,</hi> which when he had enobled

Morning, <hi>April</hi> the 29. 1658. from whence
his Body was brought to <hi>Hunſden-Houſe,</hi> and on
<hi>Saturday</hi> being <hi>May-day,</hi> was buried at <hi>Colledge-hill-Church;</hi>
His dear Friend Dr. <hi>John Pearſon</hi> (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards

Sermon, who rendred this Reaſon; why he

               <p>
                  <hi>RIchard Head,</hi> the Noted Author of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Rogue,</hi> was a Miniſters Son, born in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> whoſe Father was killed in that horrid
Rebellion in 1641. Whereupon his Mother with
this her Son came into <hi>England;</hi> and he having
been trained up in Learning, was by the help of
ſome Friends, for ſome little time brought up in
the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> in the ſame Colledge
wherein his Father had formerly been a Student.
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59216:117"/>
But means falling ſhort, he was taken away from
thence, and bound Apprentice to a Latin Bookſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
in <hi>London;</hi> attaining to a good Proficiency in
that Trade. But his Genius being addicted to
Poetry, and having <hi>Venus</hi> for his Horoſcope, e're
his time were fully out, he wrote a Piece called
<hi>Venus Cabinet Vnlock'd:</hi> Afterwards he married,
and ſet up for himſelf: But being addicted to
play, a Mans Eſtate then runs in <hi>Hazard,</hi> (for
indeed that was his Game) until he had almoſt
thrown his Shop away. Then he betook himſelf
to <hi>Ireland,</hi> his Native Country; where he compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
his <hi>Hic &amp; Vbique,</hi> a noted Comedy; and which
gained him a general Eſteem for the worth thereof.
And coming over into <hi>England,</hi> had it Printed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating
it to the then Duke of <hi>Monmouth;</hi> But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
no great Incouragement from his Patron,
he reſolved to ſettle himſelf in the World, and
to that purpoſe, with his Wife took a Houſe
in <hi>Queens-Head Alley,</hi> near <hi>Pater-Noſter-Row;</hi> and
for a while followed his Buſineſs, ſo that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Nature of a Poet, his Pockets began
to be well lined with Money: But being bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to that accurſed vice of Play, it went out by
handfuls, as it came in piece by piece. And now
he is to ſeek again in the World, whereupon he
betook him to his Pen; and wrote the firſt part of
the <hi>Engliſh Rogue:</hi> which being too much ſmutty,
would not be Licenſed, ſo that he was fain to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
it, and then it paſſed ſtamp. At the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth of this firſt part, I being with him at
three Cup Tavern in <hi>Holborn,</hi> drinking over a glaſs
of <hi>Rheniſh,</hi> made theſe verſes upon it.</p>

What <hi>Guſman, Buſcon, Francion, Rablais</hi> writ,</l>
               <l>I once applauded for moſt excellent Wit;</l>
               <l>But reading thee, and thy rich Fancies ſtore,</l>
               <l>I now condemn what I admir'd before.</l>

               <l>No Rogue ſo well-writ as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> one.</l>
               <p>There was afterwards three more parts added to
it by him, and Mr. <hi>Kirkman</hi> with a promiſe of a
fifth, which never came out.</p>
               <p>He wrote ſeveral other Books beſides, as <hi>The
art of Whedling; The Floating Iſland;</hi> or a Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
from <hi>Lambethania to Ramalia; A diſcovery of
O Brazil; Jacksons Recantation, The Red Sea,</hi> &amp;c.
Amongſt others, he had a great Fancy in Bandy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt Dr. <hi>Wild;</hi> (although I muſt confeſs
therein over Matcht) yet fell he upon him tooth
and nail in Anſwer to his Letter directed to his

great uſe and behoof as may be, mens minds

               <p>But ſhould I go about to enumerate all the
Works of this worthy Gentleman, I ſhould run
my ſelf into an irrecoverable Labyrinth. Not is
he leſs happy in his Verſe than Proſe, which for
Elegancy of Language, and quickneſs of Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
deſervedly entitles him to the honour of a
Poet; and therefore I ſhall forbear to write more
of him, ſince what I can do upon that account,
comes infinitely far ſhort of his deſervings.</p>
