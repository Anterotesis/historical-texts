            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe general acceptance this Diſcourſe found in the time of it, together with the earneſt deſire of many that it might be publiſhed for their further benefit, as alſo the intreaty of the honoured Court of Deputies, who invited to the preaching of it (which I acknowledge to the praiſe of that gracious guidance and aſſiſtance given from the Lord to the unworthy Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) hath occaſioned the expoſing it to publick view. The worth of the Author will not much commend it to any, but that of the Subject may; it being of that abſolute and univerſal neceſſity, and excellency, both for the ſpiritual, as well as outward happineſs of this whole people, ſo alſo of each particular perſon; as the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Generation immediately foregoing abundantly teſtifies. You muſt not expect any curioſity or quaintneſs, the deſign of it being to edifie more then to pleaſe, any further than pleaſing is a means to edification, and where there is ſo good a frame as to be moſt ſatiſfied with that by which they may be moſt ſpiritually profited. I remember what I have heard were ſome of the dying words of that excellent man Dr. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> that he thanked God he had been a plain Preacher, and uſed that way which the Lord is wont to accompany with the demonſtration of his Spirit: it is by that way of preaching which the world counts fooliſhneſs, that God will ſave them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. I doe not by this aime at my own credit, nor expect it will be promoted by it; but if I doe decreaſe ſo Chriſt may increaſe, I ſhall account it my glory, and the matter of my praiſe. If Faith and Love to God in Chriſt, and to his People (the ſpring of evangelical obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the way to Gods Covenant Preſence with us) may hereby be furthered, I ſhall thereby obtain my deſign. In the applicatory part, I have rather laid down rules how each ſhould carry it in their ſeveral capacities, then reproved any for miſcariages in them, as
<pb facs="tcp:66158:3"/>
judging it the beſt way to the end: ſuch miſdemeanors of publick Perſons being more in report then proofs; that never truly repreſents any man. Beſides, <hi>Regula eſt index ſui et obliqui,</hi> &amp; wiſe, if good men will uſe it as a glaſs to diſcover faults for the rectifying what is amiſs, as well as direction to them in the right way: and where they are not ſo, it is a means God bleſſeth for that end, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. when God ſo commiſſioneth it, as he did the commandment to Paul.</p>
            <p>My hearty deſire is, the gracious preſence of God may be with it, to promove thine and his Peoples happineſs, by engaging your endeavours and prayers that the Covenant Preſence of God may be with you. I am</p>

            <p>AFter I had received the invitation and call to this ſervice, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expreſs the Soul tremblings I had, (indeed ſenſe of my own unfitneſs at any time to ſpeak before ſuch an Aſſembly as this, and upon ſuch an occaſion; eſpecially in a day ſo circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as this is,) leſt you ſhould be diſappointed of that; which you ſo much need, the beſt Counſel Heaven can afford. But being ſatisfied your deſire was the Lords Call, I was ſo far en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged as to venture upon it, in expectation of divine Aſſiſtance: And now humbly beg this may be the wiſh of this whole Aſſembly, all the Lords people in it, that God may be with me as he hath been with thoſe who have formerly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in his Name, upon the like occaſion; that through the help of your prayers, and the ſupply of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, that which is lacking may be ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and this ſervice may turn to your Edification.</p>
            <p>THe words read to you, are part of Solomons bleſſing of all Iſrael, who were aſſembled at the dedication of the Temple, and was after that ſolemn Prayer he had made, for Gods ſavour to them in the variety of Caſes, and Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies might befal them, ver. 55. <hi>After all this he ſtood and bleſſed all the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</hi> He bleſſeth them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By declaring them bleſſed, and acknowledging that favour the Lord had ſhewed them, <hi>ver.</hi> 56.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By this holy and pathetical wiſh and deſire, as comprehenſive of all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular mercyes before prayed for, God might ſo be with that Generation as with the former, with the end and effect of that deſire, <hi>ver.</hi> 57, 58.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His further deſire &amp; wiſh for them, that what he had particularly mentioned in his Prayer before, might be accepted of God for them, <hi>ver.</hi> 59. and performed: with his deſigne, and end, the advancement of Gods glory, <hi>ver.</hi> 60</p>
            <p n="4">4. His holy Counſel and advice to them, how they ſhould carry it to the Lord, that they might enjoy the good deſired for them, <hi>ver.</hi> 61. The Text is the ſecond way by which he bleſſeth them, wiſhing all that good to them, that truly will make them bleſſed, ſuch a preſence of God with them, as is comprehenſive of all that follows. We bleſs others when we do wiſh &amp; truly deſire that for them which will make them ſo; eſpecially, when it is not a bare deſire, but with Autority as this was, Solomon being a Prophet as well as a King, and here acting in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary way, doing that God commanded ſhould be done by Aaron and his Sons, Numb. 6.24, to the end To which he promiſed the ratifying it, as being done in the way of an Ordinance, and Inſtitution of the Lord. In the words we have So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66158:4"/>
wiſh or deſire for Iſrael.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The petition it ſelf, expreſt, 1. Affirmatively, <hi>that God may be with us,</hi> amplified and illuſtrated, 1. By the kind of his preſence, as <hi>our God.</hi> 2. The Degree, <hi>as with our Fathers.</hi> 2. Negatively, by variety of words to the ſame ſenſe, <hi>not leave nor forſake us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Petitioner, that is Solomon, a wiſe man, their Ruler, acting as a Prophet, and in the name of all that People.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Perſons for whom it is, all the Congregation of Iſrael. I ſhall not ſpend time in giving you the various readings, or Criticiſmes about the words; they are well rendred to comprehend the ſenſe of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The wiſh, or that is deſired, 1. What is meant by the preſence of God or his being with us. 2. Our Fathers. 3. As with them. 4. Not to leave nor forſake, and why that is added. Theſe muſt be a little cleared to make way for the Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Gods being with them. There is a twofold Preſence of God, or he is ſaid to be with any two wayes,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By his eſſential Preſence, by which God is alwayes with the creatures, wherever they are, or whatever their ſtate is, Pſal. 139.7, 8. So fills heaven and earth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.24. Comprehends all things, places, contained of none, none can hide from the knowledge, nor fly from the power of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His providential or voluntary Preſence, that is either common or ſpecial, 1. Common, and that ordinary, or more extraordinary: Ordinary, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.18. Extraordinary, when the Lord raiſeth and enables any that know him not, to doe ſome notable thing in the world for the ſervice of the Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.1, 2, 3, 4. ſo ſometimes as afflictive to his people as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi> 2. Special, and that is either, 1. A gracious Preſence, 2. Glorious, that with Saints and Angels in heaven; that is the complement of their happineſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. <hi>ult.</hi> Its Gods gracious preſence here meant with his people on earth as their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant God, that we may call his new-Covenant Preſence, <hi>Let our God be with us.</hi> This gracious Preſence imports two things, 1. Conferring all good, his vigilant and efficacious providence for their good. 2. Delivering and defending from all evill, both theſe are Covenant mercies, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.1. by which he encourages Abraham, tells him what he might expect from his being in Covenant with him, to be his ſhield and exceeding great reward. And the ſigns of Gods Preſence with Iſrael were the Pillar of Fire, and Cloud, the one for day, the other for night, which was to guide them in the way, and defend them from, and ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and danger. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.19, 20. In alluſion to this, the Pſalmiſt 73.24. comforts himſelf in having the Covenant preſence of God with him, <hi>He ſhall guide me by his Counſel, and afterwards bring me to his glory.</hi> Pſ. 84.11. he is ſaid to be <hi>a Sun and a ſhield,</hi> which firſt is expounded to be his free communication of all good, not witholding it, <hi>i.e.</hi> powerfully conveying it. And all know what the benefit of a ſhield is, that intimates his with-holding all evill. This is promiſed to the reforming Jews and converted Gentiles who were brought into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.5, 6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By Fathers are meant godly Rulers and Teachers of the People of God, who are often ſo called in Scripture, as well as natural Parents, thoſe in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration before them, or long before, with whom God was moſt eminently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.1, 2, 3. Of thoſe of old, but eſpecially here is intended thoſe in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66158:4"/>
former Generations, for though the Lord was eminently with his people of old, in Moſes and Joſhuahs time, and the Judges God raiſed up extraordinarily to be their Saviours, yet in no Age was there a more gracious preſence of God then in the Age before Solomon.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>As with our Fathers,</hi> that is, ſee Iſa. 63.12, 11. Pſ. 44.3, 4. the preſence, the Church deſires, that had been with their Fathers, or ſuch a preſence. 1. In won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-working, and as gloriouſly as for them as in the ſucceſs David had over all the Enemies of Iſrael, 1 Chron. 11.9. 2 Sam. 8.6, 14, 15. 2. That preſence, or be ſo with us as with our holy Anceſtors, by his gracious communications of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to us in the wayes of his Ordinances, Pſal. 63.2. filling us with his glory, even in thoſe ſigns of his preſence as in thoſe beſt times, ver. 5, 6. as David found it when he fetched the Ark to his place, 2 Sam. 6.12, 13.14, 15. as to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with, ſo right knowledge of the things of Gods houſe, and that conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Preſence of God there, Iſai. 54.13. made David ſay, Pſal. 84.11. one day there was worth a thouſand elſe where. As alſo in civil order, Ezek. 48.35. was ſaid of them, ſo might be of us, this may be the Name, <hi>Jehovah Shammah,</hi> the name of our Courts and Churches, be with us as with them in theſe reſpects.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In-dwelling preſence, ſuch a preſence of God in our hearts as was then in theirs, filling us with his Spirit, ſtrengthening unto duty, 2 Cor. 6.18. As God promiſes thoſe that ſeperate from the world, 1 Cor, 15.10. Paul he acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he had it whence he did ſo much work, &amp; in ſuch a manner, Act 14.1. they ſo ſpake, many did believe, whence was it that thoſe before us were ſo powerful, &amp; perſwaſive, not by excelling in common gifts above many that come after, but having a fuller preſence of God, there was a more full pouring forth of the Spirit, Zec. 12.8. that which will make the feeble as David, &amp; David as an Angel of God.</p>
            <p>It may be enquired why it is ſaid, <hi>as with our Fathers?</hi> it ſeems to be a limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, when as one generation may need more then another, and uſually in ſome reſpects, a ſucceeding generation to any ſpecial reforming generation, doth: And therefore Eliſha, 2 King. 2.9. he asks a double portion of the Spirit of Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah, not only to what the other Prophets had, but what Elijah himſelf had, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to meet with harder work, a more ſinful and unreformed People.</p>

               <hi>Anſw. As,</hi> 1. Imports that kind of preſence they had ſometimes, the ſimilitude and not the degree, 1 Pet. 1.15.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It doth not alwayes limit the meaſure; a great degree of Gods gracious preſence is here meant, but not juſt ſo much is intended, ſo much as, and as much more, as the Lord ſaw good; ſo much as might carry them as well through their duty, and work, in their generation, as thoſe in theirs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The People of God are wont to gather upon God, by his grants, that is van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage ground to Faith, and Prayer, Exod. 33.13, 14, 15, 17, 18. upon every grant Moſes gets in with the Lord, and asks yet greater; ſo it ſhould be here, we ſhall be in better frame to ask more, when we have obtained ſo much, and in better hope to prevail.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Let him not leave us nor forſake us</hi>; Theſe are only amplifications, and ſhew the weight of what he did deſire, by abiding on it, not leave to others, nor to our ſelves, not quit the care of his People, Jer. 14.9. that he deprecates on the behalf of the Church, not take away ſigns of his preſence, nor his own preſence from them. Solomon his commendable practice is for our imitation. Hence the Doctrine from the words is,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:66158:5"/>Doct. <hi>The obtaining and continuance of God's eminently gracious Covenant preſence with his People ought to be ſincerely &amp; mainly deſired by thoſe that truly wiſh their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and proſperity.</hi> 1. That it ſhould be. 2. Why it ſhould be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe it is the beſt bleſſing and favour can be deſired for them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It ought to be ſo, it is that they have done, which had the greateſt love to Iſrael, as Moſes, Exod. 33.15. Let thy preſence go with us, or carry us not hence. So David deſired for Solomon, and the People under him, 1 Chron. 22.11, 18. So Solomon here when he bleſſeth Iſrael, and it was the uſual Salutation among the Jews, Ruth. 2.4.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is the moſt neceſſary bleſſing, nothing elſe is abſolutely neceſſary but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, we may be happy without Creatures, the Iſraelites found Clothes, houſes, food, was not neceſſary, not the ordinary way of its ſupply, God could ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it another way; but this cannot, Luk. 10.42. there is one thing neceſſary, that is, the gracious preſence of God, therefore Moſes chuſeth the Wilderneſs with Gods preſence, rather then Canaan without him, Exod. 33.15. Heaven is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable without it, Pſal. 73.25.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is the moſt ſuitable bleſſing to the People of God, nothing more pleaſing as well as profitable to them, Pſal. 4.6. therefore the beſt bleſſing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is a ſufficient good, you cannot deſire a more comprehenſive bleſſing, this is enough, Gen. 33.11. Jacob when he had obtained it by earneſt prayer, he acknowledgeth he had all, nothing leſs will make a people happy, more is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous. It is a ſaving, and it is a ſatisfying preſence, Jer. 14.8. all good is in it, it is ſufficient for defence againſt danger, Rom. 8.31. Pſal. 27.2.23, 4. To ſupport aſſiſt, and ſucceed, in every duty, Hag. 1.14. Math. 28.20. Gen. 39.2. ſo that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe intimates thus much, as was made to Joſhua, and applyed to the uſe of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Believer, Heb. 13.5. againſt fears of Enemies, or of want, you cannot want pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for, that have God graciouſly with you, Pſal. 144.15.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The moſt diſtinguiſhing favour, Exod. 33.16. our experience proves it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. The want of it is the greateſt evil, ſo God threatheth it, Hoſ. 9.12. and the Prophet in the Name of the Lords people, Jer. 14.9. deprecates it, as the worſt that can befal them: though Sword &amp; Famine were threatned, he takes no notice of them, but endeavours to prevent a greater; Lord do not thou leave us nor forſake us, be not thou a ſtranger, Deut. 28.15. at this gap all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evils enter, if God forſakes, Ordinances will leave you, any benefit by them, friends will forſake, all comforts, he carryes all with him, they are but his Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, Creatures and other enjoyments are but <hi>umbra Dei,</hi> eſpecially, when all your outward good came with Gods preſence, it will leave you if God doth; it is the preſence of God, hath multiplyed you, enriched you, outwardly ſanctified any of you, if he forſakes, theſe will not ſtay, no nor the People of God neither, then Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies will come, &amp; all miſery, ſuch ſhall ſay, are not all theſe things come upon us, becauſe God is not among us, &amp; Enemies will know our ſhadow is removed, Num. 14.14. It was that kept off Enemies from Iſrael, they heard the Lord was among them, that encouraged the Pſalmiſt Enemies, Pſal. 71.11. <hi>God hath forſaken,</hi> hence while God is with his People, no evil will aſſoil them, therefore as you would ſee the proſperity, and prevent the miſery of the people of God, deſire the gracious preſence of God for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE.</hi> 1. For <hi>Information,</hi> See hence who are the beſt friends of a profeſſing People: Who are thine O <hi>New-England</hi> that love you beſt, though they have not, at
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66158:5"/>
leaſt they are not ſo accounted of by you: Thoſe they are who wiſh, pray, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour that the gracious preſence of God may continue with you, and be with you as ſignally as with any of his People in former times, or in the firſt times of this People. A praying, zealous, reformed and reforming Magiſtracy, Miniſtry and People, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.7, 8. that upon your walls give God no reſt, that promote &amp; keep up the ſeperation between the precious and the vile, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.19. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.26.30. Theſe are your gap-men who prevent Gods going away, and ruine coming; but doe you not think them the troublers of Iſrael? Are you not wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them, and fain would be rid of them? The old and faithfull ones, that have ſeen the works of the Lord, doe you not wiſh others were in their room, that you might have more elboe room? Doe you not dig pits for their ſoul, that pray for yours, for a converting preſence of God, that you might be with him as your fathers were? <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.20. Thy beſt dayes are gone O <hi>New-England,</hi> if their Prayers ſhould be turned againſt you. O Sirs, yet you may revive the hopes of ſuch, if you would prize and value them, the preſence of God might be deſired and obtained by them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Then thoſe that deſire Gods departure from a People are their worſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: Such as would drive away or remove his gracious preſence from you. <hi>Job.</hi> 21.14, 15. There are ſuch men as would fain be rid of the preſence of God, ſome ſuch bold ſinners, they ſay it with their mouthes, would have no Sabbaths, nor preaching nor preciſe walking, would be rid of godly Magiſtrates, Miniſters, Chriſtians, they have too much of them: all wicked men ſay it in their hearts, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in their practices, and wicked works, eſpecially ſenſual Sinners, and that have fullneſs of the world, have all their carnal hearts doe wiſh, they love not the preſence of God, its not the way to ſinfull pleaſure or profit or credit in the world, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.10, 11, 12. will not endure plain diſtinguiſhing, ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting preaching, but muſt be ſoothed, pleaſed in a ſinfull way; ſo would have the holy one to ceaſe from among them, the ſanctifiing preſence of God, that they cannot bear: and what follows? Theſe are the worſt enemies among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that would take away your God. <hi>Judg.</hi> 18.24. he thought ſo of them that took away his dung-hill gods, and thoſe means of worſhip of his own inventing, how much more reaſon have you to look upon them that would take away your glory, the ſigns of Gods gracious preſence, even his own holy inſtitutions.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hence ſee how to make a right judgement of the happineſs or miſery of any people, it is according to the preſence of God among them, his gracious preſence, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19. It is that makes the moſt noted difference between one people and another, the ſame people in one time and in another, according to the manifeſtation of his preſence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.15. May it not in this reſpect be true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, former dayes were better than theſe, when they had more of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence then now: but the Wiſe man reproves the ſaying ſo, that former dayes were better. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The meaning is not, that ſome dayes of the Church and people of God are not more troubleſome, and others more proſperous, and that we ſhould not bewail with godly ſorrow the evil of the dayes we live in, and the ſins &amp; judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that make them ſo; you muſt ſee they are ſo, and enquire into the cauſe, but the meaning is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That which is blamed is, ſo to complain of the evill of preſent time, as not to take notice of the good in it that the Lord continues, that is folly, when the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66158:6"/>
Lord hath removed many choice and precious ones from the Bench and the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, yet we ought to take notice with thankfulneſs, of the precious ones there, whom he hath left, and ſo much of his preſence with them. This was their ſin, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.4, 5. <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor ſhould we complain that our Lot is caſt in ſuch a day, that is to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure at the providence of God, and the holy government of it, who hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the places and times of every perſon. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.26.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To inſiſt upon a wrong cauſe, and charge the poſitive and meritorious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil upon the times; but this is wiſe enquiry and judgement, when we ſee our own and others ſins to be the cauſe of evil times, and that evil men make evil dayes. 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. they are the deſerving or meritorions cauſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To judge the want of outward things, or preſence of outward evils to be the cauſe deficient or privative of worſe times, that mens trade and eſtates grow worſe; when the true cauſe or want is the gracious preſence of God which is hindred by our ſins. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.1, 2. That there ſhould be no ſpiritual thriving, and trade with heaven ſhould be on the loſing hand. So to ſee times where leſs of God is, to be worſe, is wiſdome to enquire the cauſe that it may be mended, and we may obtain the preſence of God with us as in former times.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE</hi> 2. Of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> To this great Aſſembly, That you would ſincerely deſire the preſence of God with this People, <hi>as with their Fathers.</hi> I am encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to preſs this upon you, being well perſwaded, I ſpeak to a great many, that love the proſperity of Jeruſalem, and that come to be directed in the way to it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Endeavour it. 2. Earneſtly pray for it. I will give you but theſe two ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral directions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To endeavour it, do what you can, and lyes with you it may be ſo, true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are alwayes followed with ſuitable endeavours, for they are the iſſuings and goings out of the will, to the good it hath choſen; there are two main acts of the will, <hi>viz.</hi> elicite and imperate, and having choſen it, purſues it by Commands to every faculty of the Soul, yea, and members of the body. The underſtanding that it ſhould inform it ſelf, what is the beſt way, and then affections to love or hate, as this good is furthered or hindred, or we in the obtaining of it. Direction for your endeavour better cannot be given then what is in 2 Chron. 15.2 being from the immediate guidance &amp; inſpiration of the Spirit of God. 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 28.9. The viſible gracious preſence of God is conditional with a viſible People, ſee that you fulfil it, performing your Covenant duty to God in your ſeveral Relations you ſtand in to him and his People: It is not enough you are not againſt him in ſuch a day, neutrality will be counted oppoſition, <hi>Math.</hi> 12.30.</p>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Men, Brethren, and Fathers.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Endeavour, (I ſpeak to this whole Aſſembly together) to keep and recover Gods preſence by deep humiliation for, and through Reformation of what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking to the Lord, ſearch out the <hi>Achan</hi> and judge it, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.12. otherwiſe the Lord will not be among you, ſin and the holy God cannot be together in the ſame heart, nor place, were it is allowed, Am. 3.2. <hi>if two walk together they muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,</hi> bewaile and reform Senſuality, want of firſt love, lukewarmneſs in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Animoſities, unbelief, you have been frequently minded of thoſe ſins you all know to be ſo, find and clear each of you your perſonal guilt in any of them. This
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66158:6"/>
is Covenant duty with promiſe of Covenant mercy, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.41.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let God have his will, do not croſs him, but labour to pleaſe him, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he is your Sovereign, he will be with you as ſuch an one, therefore you muſt be with him as his Subjects: ſubject to all his Commands, and ſubmit to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, that is the way to his favour, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.58. it is the effect of, and way to his gracious preſence, to walk as according to his poſitive, ſo his inſtituted will, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.1, 2, 3, to <hi>ve..</hi> 13. then you walk with God when you obey his will, and he will be with you by fulfilling his promiſes to you, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Job.</hi> 14.23. <hi>Job.</hi> 8.29. and when you ſubmit, to his providences, <hi>Deu.</hi> 3.17, 24.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Give him good content, value and highly prize his preſence, the Lord is not wont to leave any till undervalued by them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.12. when they took not full content in him, then he gave them up, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5, 15. therefore ſee you get and keep up love to his preſence, ſo to the ſigns of it in his Ordinances, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 52.7, 8. value Miniſtry, and the faithful Miniſters, eſteem them as choice Covenant bleſſings, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.15. And godly Rulers, when thoſe that love you rule over you, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10.8.9. be not weary of them, and Sabbaths, but <hi>call them your delight,</hi> Iſai. 58.8.9, 10. maintain an humble ſenſe of your unworthineſs of it, and yet a need of it, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57.15. be thankful for the leaſt diſcoveries of it, and yet earneſtly deſirous of the moſt, eſpecially value God's Son, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.12.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>A Word to the Freemen.</head>
               <p>To all concerned in the work of this day, if you are with God in your chuſing, and they are ſo who are choſen by you as our Fathers were, we may expect the Lord will be ſo with his people: our fears or hopes will be furthered as this day is managed. It is promiſed as an high Teſtimony of Gods favour to his People, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.26. when he gives them Judges as at the firſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and how doth he give them but in that way of giving you hearts to chuſe ſuch, for it is a fruit of the right managing that other Covenant priviledge, the Lord hath betruſted you with, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.20. to have our Governours from among our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be not negligent in your choice, this liberty is a Talent, you have this day another opportunity to uſe it, do not hide it in a napkin, or in the Earth, as that unfaithful Servant, <hi>Math.</hi> 25.24, 25. that your worldly buſineſs may not take up that time ſhould be employed in this Service. I have heard it much complained of, that Freemens meetings are not attended, not half of them appear upon choice of Deputies in this Town, and other concerns in that nature: and many that do come, have never prayed for guidance, nor made enquiries of things, or perſons; but only do as they are led. Is not this to do the work of the Lord negligently? To be careleſs of your Oath? And to be acceſſary to all the miſchief you might have prevented, if it be any otherwiſe then well, and to have no part nor ſhare in what good the Lord this way brings about to his People?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe who are active, ſee that it be for God, the glory of God, and the good of his People: be on Gods ſide, let not private reſpects ſway you in your Elections, to be for thoſe that are your friends or favourers, be for God, and he will be with you. If you would be ſo, then let your choice be guided and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by the word of God, ſee how men ſtand affected to Religion, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good of this people. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.3. He muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of God. If they had the wiſdome of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Juſtice of <hi>Trajan,</hi> &amp;c. they would not be fit for this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66158:7"/>
People, if they are not pious. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>wiſdome with an Inheritance is good,</hi> that is moſt true here, or it is good, I mean that he be an heir of glory, be truly gracious, other qualifications muſt not be ſevered from, but ſeaſoned with the fear of God. It is true, every godly man is not fit to be a Ruler, and as true, no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly man is. They that are not true to God, can never be ſo to the main Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of this his People: All other qualifications without this will make them but the more dangerous Enemies to the People of God. Be ſure then you chuſe friends of God, if by them you would expect a manifeſtation of his friendſhip to you. It is true, the beſt are ſubject to infirmities, that may be perſonal diſadvantages, but they will be faithful to the intereſt of godlineſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When you have choſen them, know that you are with God in a right and regular carriage to them, and in the way to have him with you and us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If it be a good choice of holy men, bleſs God for it, and take it as a pledge and token of his favour to you, and his preſence with you, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.24. If otherwiſe, there is no Reaſon to complain of any, but your ſelves, therefore you ſhould humble your ſelves before God as deſerving ſuch a Judgement; and for your ſinfulneſs in chuſing it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Follow them with your prayers, God may be with them, as he hath been with thoſe before them, if you would pray more for them, and complain leſs of them you would be better People, and would find them more a bleſſing to you. If their miſſing it further your prayers, that is the beſt way to rectifie their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2. whence you were ſolemnly exhorted to it the laſt year, by a faithful Servant of Chriſt</p>
               <p n="3">3. obey them; though this or that form of Government is mans creature, yet Magiſtracy is the Lords Ordinance, and their authority in thoſe places is from God: therefore <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1, 2. Chriſtians were bound for conſcience ſake to obey evill ones, when got into place, much more when good, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.1. and a further obligation you have then other people, to ready obedience, they are of your own choice.</p>
               <p>Remember when you chuſe them, they are men: you chuſe not Angels, but men of like infirmity with other good men in this world, therefore expect not too much, but you ought to think that all will not be done that ought to be: But alſo know when you have choſen them, they are gods by office, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.6. and in the exerciſe of that to be obeyed, though only in the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A word to thoſe that are, and may be our Rulers, Honoured in the Lord, much may be done by you to obtain and maintain the preſence of God with this People: One faithfull man on the Bench, may ſtop the gap, and prevent Gods going out at it, or enemies coming in. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.30. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.23. I would hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly commend to you that which is your main duty, in which you ought to walk with God in that ſtation, and do your part, God may be with you, and ſo with this People. It is direction given by divine Oracle, God the Father and the Son by the Spirit ſpake it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.3. A Scripture hath been improved profitably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you upon this occaſion, by a worthy Servant of God now with the Lord, as a direction in the choice of ſuch that may be a bleſſing to a People, and to them choſen how to carry it, that the People over whom they are may have the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſence of God among them, and continued with them, not only a promiſe they ſhould have ſuch a Ruler, but a precept what they ſhould be, that are Rulers of Iſrael. More particularly,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:66158:7"/>1. The care of the People of God and the things of God is in a great meaſure committed to you, as you engage your Authority for the protection and defence of theſe, ſo you are with the Lord, and he will be with you and his People by your means.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the People of God, theſe are dear to God, and as the Apple of his Eye, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.8. as he is ſenſible of the leaſt wrong done to them, ſo of every kindneſs and favour ſhewed to them, you are as the viſible covers to theſe Eyes, their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward defence under God lyes upon you; as it is a ſpecial favour to Gods people to have ſuch as fear the Lord over them, ſo is it an high honour to be over ſuch a People, and the Lord further manifeſts his kindneſs to Rulers, when they are ſpirited and raiſed up to be Saviours upon Mount Zion; it is both a manifeſtation of it, and a ſign of more, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.5, 6, 8. when God will make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome ſtone to all that heave at them, then ſhall their Rulers be encouraged to ſtand by them, as being ſtrong in having a people in Covenant with God to ſtand for, ſo the God of that Covenant. To theſe the Lord promiſeth great ſucceſs, as fire is to the wood laid upon it in the Hearth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo ſhall they be to their Enemies, they ſhall prevail againſt them. Let Gods out-caſts dwell with you, and your Countenance and Favour be extended to all, that truly fear the Lord, though in ſome Circumſtances they may not be of your mind, when they carry it without juſt offence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Care of the things of God, his worſhip, that is alſo incumbent on you as Rulers, defence of, and encouragement in the practice of godlineſs, and matters of worſhip: I am far from thinking, Magiſtrates in New-Teſtament times, have nothing to do with, either the reſtraining or encouraging outward acts of men referring to the firſt Table: The commended Examples in Old-Teſtament times, that were moral actions are for our Inſtruction, as well as moral precepts (where thoſe actions were not extraordinary,) As thoſe about the worſhip of God and religious obſervation of the Sabbath, that then were under divine Inſtitution as to that time, and mode of Service: There is the ſame obligation to the care of the Lords day now, and Inſtitutions of Chriſt in the New-Teſtament.</p>
               <p>But to wave the diſpute of it, what is the duty, is the greateſt difficulty, and made the darker, by the various apprehenſions of worthy and excellent men. I ſhall not undertake deciſion of that Caſe, but ſhall endeavour to hold forth ſo much light for your direction in it, you may be with God, &amp; act in Integrity and Evangelical Perfection: And know you that the Lord will not withdraw becauſe of Infirmities, and weakneſſes, where there are not wilful miſcarriages of his Servants.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Defend them that are the moſt pretious things of this people, &amp; then liberty to enjoy the Ordinances of God in their purity, you muſt uſe your Authority for their defence, not only from open, but ſecret Enemies; And what ever tends to the ruine and overthrow of the Churches here eſtabliſhed. And as was well hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a worthy perſon in his Election Sermon, leſs will undoe us here, (this is but a little Boat) then in greater Kingdomes. I do not think errors of the mind can be compelled, but by light and Reaſon, or that any can be forced to be of another mind; they muſt be drawn, not driven, that heartily cloſe with Chriſt, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Religion.</p>
               <p>But if any under pretenſe of Religion will endeavour the ſubverſion of that is true, and ſo eſteemed by thoſe in Authority, ſuch endeavours ought to be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them, and powerfully obviated.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:66158:8"/>I am perſwaded, that all the people of God are agreed in the end, that injury, at leaſt ruine ſhould be hindred Authoritatively, the greateſt doubt is about the means, what is the beſt way to overthrow the deſigns of thoſe that are Enemies, and fundamentally ſo to the welfare of this People, and it is high wiſdome, the choiſe of the fitteſt means to the end; it is very hard to ſay what that is, they can beſt judge of it that hear all the Circumſtances of a Caſe. That I would hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly commend is, when you cannot all agree upon the way, uſe condeſcendency to each other, that you may agree, <hi>vis unita fortior.</hi> That which is done with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Concurrence you may expect moſt of Gods preſence with, and will be moſt effectual, though in it ſelf it may ſeem moſt contemptible.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let them have your countenance and encouragement, that is by your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and Authority maintain and uphold the true worſhip of God, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.6, 7, 8. Jehoſhaphat was commended for his care that all places might have a faithful teaching Miniſter, ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 9. how the Lord was with them, <hi>Neb.</hi> 13.11. Nehemiah he took care that the houſe of God it might not be forſaken by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing neceſſary ſupports for thoſe that attend the ſervice of God, oyle there muſt be to maintain the Lights. They are duties of neceſſity, not liberty of Juſtice, not Charity, ſo fall under your Cognizance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The matters of men are alſo your care, and therein you are with God when there is due execution of Juſtice, if it be ſpeedy, Impartial as our Fathers were, ſuch have been in theſe places that could not by friendſhip, or flattery, or bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be turned out of the way of right Judgement, but have judged for the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.15, 19. as Joſiah was commended for it, and it was well with him and his People, <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.1. and <hi>Righteouſneſs exalts a Nation,</hi> Prov. 14.34. the contrary evil is its Reproach, Juſtice ſaith the Philoſopher, is all virtue.</p>
               <p>A word to the <hi>Reverend Elders,</hi> much may be done by you, <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> that the gracious preſence of God may be continued with this People. If we be ſo with God as thoſe that went before us, he will be with us, as he was with them. One <hi>Jehojadah,</hi> of how much uſe was his Faithfulneſs to God in the matters of his worſhip, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 12.2.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Endeavour the like agreement and union, in promoving the Truths of the goſpel. It was promiſed to goſpel times, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 52.7, 8. That thoſe who brought the glad Tydings of the goſpel, ſhould lift up their voice together, and ſing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, this the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. applyes to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, and I believe it had as eminent a fulfilling in thoſe faithful and pretious Elders, that were firſt planters of the Churhes here, as ever ſince the primitive times, in exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together the reign and government of Chriſt in his Church; and though in ſome Circumſtances they differed, (for in thoſe things is the greateſt difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the godly) yet they agreed in the ſubſtance, and manifeſted it in that Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of Diſcipline, which was publiſhed as the Judgement of the Miniſters of <hi>New-England,</hi> aſſerting the Authoritative Rule of the Elders with the liberty of the Brethren. Though the Judgement of the beſt, ſhould not be looked upon as Scripture Canons, nor bind any further, then it is found agreeing with the Word of God, by which it ought to be tryed; yet I think I may ſafely ſay, that is a clearer Judgement of the mind of God in the Scripture, in that matter, then can be expected in this next generation: I ſhould rather ſuſpect my own Judgement in the Scriptures, then theirs about that Caſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſidering how ſingularly they were qualified for that diſcovery, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.11.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66158:8"/>
though it is true, in improvements of natural light, that may be encreaſed by induſtry, and thoſe that ſtand upon others ſhoulders, may ſee further then they did upon whoſe ſhoulders they ſtand; but it is not ſo in ſpiritual things, the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowledge of which depends upon Revelation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17. and the humble the Lord teacheth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. In that glorious diſcovery is Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inthroning himſelf in the midſt of his Church, affording gracious ſupplyes and protection to them, is manifeſted to John when prepared by an heavenly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie, which was the Theater in which he did behold it. When we find a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men more holy, humble, and diligent, then thoſe were, ſomething more may be expected.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They were free from outward Temptations to pleaſe men, having a people ready to receive what ſhould be made known to them, upon their ſerious ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the mind of God in his word: beſides the Conflicts and agitations from abroad, to put them upon their fuller examination of it by the word of God; and to weigh it in the ballance of the Sanctuary.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We ſhall not find in Scripture, or other Hiſtories of the Church, that the next Age after any conſiderable progreſs in Reformation, did go beyond the firſt, but the contrary, <hi>Judg.</hi> 2.10. there have been gradual declinings till that light hath almoſt been extinguiſhed; then the Lord hath raiſed a new ſpirit of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, to whom he hath given &amp; revealed more of his will, &amp; further knowledge of his truth: Nay we may read of ſome of the Lords faithfull ſervants, that their firſt wayes have been the beſt, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.3. So with Solomon; &amp; our Lord Jeſus blames the Epheſian Church for forſaking their firſt love, and where love decayes light doth not increaſe in practical Truths, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.5. This was <hi>New-Englands</hi> glory and deſign, they came not hither to aſſert the prophetical or Prieſtly office of Chriſt ſo much, that were ſo fully owned in <hi>Old England,</hi> but his kingly, to bear witneſs to thoſe truths concerning his viſible Kingdome, the maintaining of theſe lyes much with you. I am perſwaded, that the truth concerning the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt, is that word of Chriſts patience, that the Phyladelphian Church is commended for <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.10. and hath that gracious preſence of Chriſt promiſed to it, that they ſhall be kept from the hour of temptation coming upon the whole world.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is that Chriſt ſuffered for, <hi>John</hi> 18.37. This cauſe was written upon his Croſs, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.19.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His Kingdome is as yet a Kingdome of Patience, therefore the word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it muſt be a word of patience, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.9. and they that own it, their Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will be exerciſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The greateſt oppoſition ſinners make, yea ſuch as are profeſſed Chriſtians, is to the inviſible and viſible Rule of Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.14.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is the laſt truth to be ſuffered for, which Suffering uſhers in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of his Power, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.11, 12, 15.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Endeavour to ſave this People, pray and preach for their Converſion, not ſo much to pleaſe as profit them; let it be ſeperating Preaching, <hi>Ier.</hi> 15.19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1, 2, 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be faithfull to Chriſt in teaching all, and only what Chriſt hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Math.</hi> 28.18, 20. that is, all that is neceſſary for their ſalvation and edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.27.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Be examples to the Flock. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5, 3. of Meekneſs, Humility, Self-denial
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66158:9"/>
and Sobriety. A more exemplary Miniſtry the world hath not had then <hi>New-England,</hi> and the Lord was with them, let us not come behind them: Men are taught more and readier to learn by example then precept: while you are thus with God, He will not leave nor forſake this people.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let me leave a few words of advice with this honour'd Court, who have called me to this Service: Honoured Sirs, you have given me the opportunity thus to ſpeak to you, yet my meſſage is from above, I ſpeak to you now under the influence of a greater authority then yours, or any under heaven. Let me hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeech and adviſe you, as thoſe I beleive ſeek the welfare of this people, to doe your part that the gracious preſence of the Lord may be with us as in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be couragious for God and his People, our lives and liberties, civil and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, are put into your truſt, you may ſave or deſtroy us under God; quit you like Chriſtians, and as former Courts; difficulties may be before you, but ſtudy more what becomes you at this time, then what will become of you: Enquire what is your duty, and God would have you to do, be ſollicitous more to pleaſe God then men, nay, aſſure your ſelves men you cannot pleaſe, the Lord you may, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.7. and though hard and hazardous work is before you, if the Lord ſet you upon it, he will not leave you in it; <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.4. This is the way to have God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage with you, when you truſt all with him; make the word of God the Rule of your proceedings, and remember Iſſues and Events are the Lords, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain to us; but if you be ſincere for the glory of God, and in the doing your duty, though in ſome things you may miſs it, God will own you in it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.15. And the Iſſue will certainly be good to you and us,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be unanimous, let your Conſultations and reſults be ſo as much as may be, the bundle of Arrows is not ſo eaſily broken as one, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. what he ſaith of Church ſociety is true of any of the Aſſemblies of the People of God, <hi>be at peace and the God of peace will be with you,</hi> and if with you, ſo far he is with us; union is your ſtrength; your dividing is like an Armies breaking rank when an Enemy is aſſaulting them. Thoſe that ſeek the ruine of the whole, firſt endeavour it by dividing you, ſhall Herod and Pilate agree againſt Chriſt; and ſhall not Chriſtians for him, and that at a time when there is ſo general a Conſpiracy and conſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Enemies of the Truth, againſt all the Profeſſors of it? Believe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of each other, take not up prejudices, if you have prejudged their perſons, you will make no right Judgement of what they ſay, preſs not things wherein there may be different apprehenſions, too hard, nor heighten it by giving the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference too ill a Name, or too good, too odious, or glorious; if there be leſſer Animoſities, and perſonal, lay them aſide, they may not hinder union for publick good, two brave Romans did ſo. The Agreement of this Court would have an healing influence upon all other Societies under you, your practice of it would ſpeak more then all other deſires of it, and do more then all other endeavours.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Your being with God, will much appear in the Laws you make, to be the Rules of others walking under you, ſee that none of them be repugnant to the Laws of heaven, or unſuitable to the ſtate of this People; if any be ſo, better ſhew your authority in nulling them, then neglect or contempt of them ſhould leſſen your authority: What are good, ſee to it they may be executed: as much of the wiſdome of a people is ſeen in their making laws, ſo is their authority in the due execution of them, &amp; their holineſs <hi>Deu.</hi> 5.8. if you do not make the Laws
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66158:9"/>
ſpeak by executing of them, what men falſly charge on God, may be too truly on men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21. are like them either in weakneſs, or wickedneſs, you either dare not ſhew your diſlike, or have it not.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Suffer not Plantations to be without a godly and faithful Miniſter, not to ſet down without Gods Ordinances, which are ſigns of Gods preſence, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.24. and means alſo by which, and in which he is among a People, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.34. without the true God, when without teaching Prieſts, and no way of viſible wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Where perſons are not fit to judge for themſelves who are fit to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the holy things of God, provide ſome way that Heterodox and ungodly ones may not be encouraged; Tares will ſooner grow then wheat.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Acquaint your ſelves with the Hiſtory of the glorious works of God, for this people in former times, thoſe manifeſtations of Gods preſence with our Fathers, &amp; further the knowledge of it among this people: you have been often minded of it, &amp; though ſomething hath been done towards it, by Reverend &amp; worthy perſons, yet thoſe providences and experiences of ſeaſonable and wonderful ſupplyes, &amp; protections, that have been moſt remarkable, I have not yet ſeen. The full ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this people to this day would be one of the beſt of humane Hiſtories, for the time of it, in the world, many things yet may be had from thoſe that have ſeen thoſe wonderful works, and Fathers ſhould tell it to their Children, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.1, 2, 3. you are our publick Fathers, tell it then to your Children, the knowledge of this by Solomon was the ground of his wiſh for the like. It was uſual with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in former times that had not the way you have to communicate remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Providences to after Ages, to do it by erecting Monuments, or putting a name upon the place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.14. ſo to preſerve the memory of famous Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.14, 15. ſo Moſes by divine direction kept a Record of that victory over <hi>Amalec, Pſal.</hi> 70, &amp;c. many Pſalms there are to call to remembrance, thence it was <hi>Bethel</hi> had its Name, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.19. ſo that Well, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.14. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 4.3, 4. God himſelf gives himſelf a new Title upon it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.12. and it is a means of Gods preſence and bleſſing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.3, 4. that they may ſet their hope in God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As you ſhould endeavour each in his place, we may have this preſence of God, ſo pray for it earneſtly, Importunately, ſtirring up your ſelves to take hold of God, you may not let him goe; be not willing to let go your hold on him; Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue the Caſe with humble and holy boldneſs as Moſes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.15. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.13, 14. <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.9. ſay as ſhe, <hi>Ruth</hi> 1.16. as <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 32.26. reſolve to take no denyal, Magiſtrates ſhould pray he may be with this people, and the People he may be with them, with our Courts, our Miniſters, in our Churches, with thoſe that chuſe, &amp;c. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.58. To ſtir up your endeavour and deſire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mot.</hi> 1. Conſider, never did you need it more then now, you have more Enemies, and thoſe more potent, you have fewer friends, and thoſe leſs power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, your work is greater, difficulties more formidable, ſuch Mountains as cannot be removed by humane might or power, but alone by the Spirit of the Lord, <hi>Zec.</hi> 4.7. And divine help, <hi>Math.</hi> 8.26. What will not men doe when the Ship is ready to ſink, and thoſe in it to periſh? O therefore awaken Chriſt with your Cry!</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider how much of that gracious Preſence of God ſeems to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from us, that our Fathers enjoyed, may we not humbly expoſtulate the caſe with our ſelves, as the Church with God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.13, 14, 15. <hi>Where is he?</hi> where is that wonder-working Providence, whereby he did deſtroy the enemies
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66158:10"/>
of his people, and lead his People through the greateſt ſtreights? that guiding, aſſiſting, ſucceeding and defending Preſence of God? that heart humbling, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting, ſanctifying Preſence in Ordinances, when he knock'd at the door of of your hearts in the Miniſtry of his word, and making way for his own enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment? Is he ſo nigh to us in all we call upon him for? <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.7. When <hi>before they cried he anſwered them, and heard them while they were ſpeaking to him. Iſa</hi> 65.24. When there were ſuch overflowing of Compaſſions, that he ran to meet his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he might fall on their necks and kiſs them. Were there not ſuch happy dayes in <hi>New-England,</hi> and is it ſo now? O then follow him, let him not goe far away, ſtop him at the Towns end.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider, how unwilling the Lord is to leave and forſake a People he hath ſo owned to be his, and done ſo much for. How many Stayes hath he made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, by ſtilling the tumult of the Heathen, removing Sickneſs? Doth he not ſay as <hi>Hoſ</hi> 5.15. O <hi>New-England</hi> are you willing to have me ſtill? then ſeek him early. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.15. His preventing evills from abroad, removing the worſt of your enemies; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.22. The argument Samuel uſeth to further their endeavour to keep him with them, and recover his preſence among them, the glory of his free mercy and goodneſs engageth him with you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.11. <hi>He hath choſen this for his habitation,</hi> He is your God: The argument in my Text, plead it, and improve it, and remember it is in a Covenant of Grace he is yours: he takes not advantage of ſmaller offences, they break not this Relation; if greater ones, yet he admits of Repentance. If he ſeems as if he would be gone, it is but to try your love, and draw out your importunity, ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.26. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.10. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.28. <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.9. Nay this will be a ſign the Lord will be with us, if we are unwilling he ſhould leave us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider the advantage of having Gods gracious Preſence to this preſent, and future Generations; if I had the tongue and knowledge of an Angel, I could not tell you the half to be gotten by this way: This will be light to you in your darkneſs, deliverance in dangers, ſtrength in weakneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.1. Supplies in all your wants, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.1. and 46.1. &amp;c. A preſent, a powerfull help, ſucceſs in all affairs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.2. it is a full and a ſufficient bleſſing, this will be your Glory, and a defence upon it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.4, 5. This will heal all our breaches, recover all our loſſes, reſtore ſuch a Magiſtracy to you as at the firſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.26. and ſuch a people to them: Ordinances will be powerfull for Converſion and Reformation. 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8.58. hearts ſhall be inclined: nay your Children ſhall be taught of God, and great ſhall be their peace, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.13. The name of this City ſhall be <hi>Jehovah Shammah,</hi> Ezek. 48. <hi>ult.</hi> Pſal. 67.6, 7. <hi>Then ſhall the earth yield her increaſe, and God, even our own God ſhall bleſs us.</hi> When you ſhall lay your heads in the duſt, you will have the beſt Legacy to leave with your Children, that which good old Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob did with Joſeph, Gen. 48.21. <hi>I dye, but God ſhall be with you</hi>: the ſucceeding Generation will bleſs God for you, &amp; call you Bleſſed, &amp; may then be encouraged to the ſame deſire and endeavour for their Generation, that God may be with them as he was with their Fathers, he would not leave nor forſake them; their hearts may be inclined to walk in all the wayes of the Lord for ever.</p>
