            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

It is a vile and lewd perverting of my words &amp; meaning, to ſay (as you doe) that liberty granted to tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in Religion, is by me compared to this Trojan Horſe: For I ſpeak plainly of an Univerſall toleration of all wayes and conſciences in Religion, and that not as eſtabliſhed and owned by the State (as ſome did calumniate me) (For I knew, and know that there was an Act made againſt <hi>Ranteriſme,</hi> that they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themſelves againſt <hi>Arrians</hi> in condemning Mr. <hi>Fry</hi> his book; and againſt <hi>Socinians</hi> in ordering the <hi>Cracovian</hi> Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme to be burnt, for which their zeal for Chriſt and his Truth, I bleſſe the Lord, and wiſh, that from all Gods people they may have their deſerved honour) but I mentioned it onely as a thing pleaded for, taken up by the head-ſtrong practiſe of too many, which is ſadly evident to the World.

In which eſtate of Religion, though we have, and might have, more liberty than heretofore under the Prelates, and were to be thankfull to God and Man for our liberty to ſerve God in his own way. Yet no good Chriſtian but muſt needs take it to heart, to the great abatement of his comfort, to ſee as much liberty gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Errour, Hereſie, Idolatry, &amp;c. as to Chriſt's owne ſaving Truth, and that ſuch abominations to Chriſts open diſhonour, and the damnation of ſoules ſhould have free courſe and paſſage. I know not well what you mean by a Worldly power, whoſe Prop our Church ſhould need. The civill power of the Magiſtrate, eſpecially in a Chriſtian, is unfitly ſo nick-named: For it is an Ordinance of God, and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But if by it you mean the civill Power, I doubt not but that our Church, as a true Church of Chriſt, can ſtand without that prop.

            <p>Now your Scriptures make not againſt this Aſſertion thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained: For they chiefly intend the inward converſion, and work of Grace in the heart, which is onely the work of the Spirit, and to which the civil power cannot reach; nor doe we allow him to meddle with it, as if by his Lawes he could work it. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern not theſe outward actions mentioned, which may be reached and regulated by the civill Power. And though inward Converſion be the ſole work of the Spirit, yet doth it not exclude the uſe of outward meanes, which do either more directly conduce or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally make ſome way for that work.</p>

And therefore all things that are done toward the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of this Kingdome, are not wholly done without hands or externall meanes: And why then may not Chriſt alſo uſe ſome hands or externall meanes, in ſome things that more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly tend to the ſetting up and maintaining his Church and Kingdom? whoſe ſucceſſe and efficacy yet is not from themſelves, but wholly from Chriſts power and ſpirit, and ſo effected, as it were, without hands.

And it is better that againſt their will they be reſtrained from evill, than that they be permitted willingly to ruſh into it. It is alſo an <hi>Antinomian</hi> miſconceit to think that nothing is done willingly, and out of love to God, which is done out of obedience and reſpect to a commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enjoyning or prohibiting it. 2.

Willingneſſe to doe good, and acting out of love, is nothing hindred, but may be promoted by the command of Authority. It is true, that if a thing be done onely out of obedience and reſpect to mans command, it wants its acceptance with God, but it is good in it ſelfe; and though an humane command may give ſome occaſion to the doing of it; yet a godly perſon will doe it alſo, yea, and more out of the love of God, and to ſhew his ready obedience to him.

It is not in vain for Miniſters to preach, though they cannot create Faith in the hearts of diſſenters; nor for Magiſtrates to command hearing of the Word, though they can infuſe no faith into the heart, the outward meanes are rightly uſed, where the inward effect can be only wrought by God.

The power of the firſt is onely ſpirituall and eccleſiaſticall, and doth allow them no other meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime men from Idolatry, Hereſie, or any ſin, and to win them to the obedience of the Goſpel, but ſpirituall, <hi>viz.</hi> the preaching of the Goſpel, and Church cenſures.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But the power of the Magiſtrate is ſuch, as doth furniſh them with authority, to lay commands on men to urge them to what is good, and puniſhments to reclaime from evil.

            <p n="3">3. Forced motions are uſed for the common good in other things, and that without blame, and ſo may be here in ſome things, and in the order above preſcribed.

And what lets, but that ſome conſtraint with wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and moderation may be uſed in religious matters, ſince it is a thing moſt juſt and righteous, and for the common good, both civill and ſpirituall, that Idolatry and Hereſie be ſuppreſſed, and that the people doe attend the preaching of the Word,

            <p>But laſt, This makes as much againſt all correction of children, and all law-making about matters of the ſecond Table, as againſt coercive lawes in Religion.

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Argument, as ſome other before, proceedes upon a falſe ſuppoſition.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It ſurmiſeth, That ſuch Magiſtraticall commands and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, by our opinion, ſerve to work inward grace in mens hearts, and for their converſion, when we teach that they are onely to order the outward actions of man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It ſurmiſeth, that they oppoſe and goe contrary to the work of the Goſpel in mens converſion, which is utterly untrue. And the courſe, which by thoſe that plead for the Magiſtrates power in this thing, is commended to the Mag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57802:14"/>

            <p n="2">2. This courſe is far from oppoſing the Goſpel's way, as that it directly tends to further the working of it, that the Lord thereby, according to his Covenant, may write his lawes in his peoples hearts. The end of it (as was ſaid above) is to bring men to the hearing of the Goſpel, and attend upon it; without which it can never work either to the illightening of their underſtanding, or the perſwading of their wills. Moreover, for the Covenant, which is, <hi>That God will write his lawes in the heart;</hi> this writing, no doubt, is meant of the whole Law, that of the ſecond table as well as that of the firſt. What then, may not Magiſtrates make Lawes to regulate mens actions in duties of the ſecond Table, as againſt the foule ſins againſt it, becauſe Gods Covenant is to write theſe in the hearts of his people? And if this writing ſuch lawes in mens hearts, evacuate not the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates legiſlative power about ſuch duties, why ſhould it take away the Magiſtrates power to make lawes about Religion, and the duties thereof? The like may be ſaid concerning the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels illightening the minde, and perſwading the will, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes not onely the myſteries of the Goſpel, and matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but the works and duties of the ſecond Table; to the right peformance whereof there is need of the illightening of the minde, and perſwading of the will; about ordering which, yet power is granted to the Magiſtrate. Farther, Why goe you not on to urge this farther with Familiſts, and Seekers, and the like, againſt preaching the Word, and ſuch other meanes of edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as vaine and uſeleſſe, ſince God doth promiſe to write his lawes in his choſens hearts and mindes, without mentioning any ſuch external helps, yea addeth, that they ſhall no more teach one another, ſaying, <q>Know the Lord, for they ſhall know every one the Lord from the greateſt unto the leaſt of them.<bibl> Jer. 31. 33. 34.</bibl>

            <p>Obj. <hi>You endeavour by a contrary courſe to conſtraine the body to what the heart oppoſeth: And then, if whatſoever be not of Faith, is Sin, your courſe is contrary to the Goſpel-order, and deſtructive to mens ſoules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Argument ſeemes not to be your <hi>Helena</hi> (as you call an Argument of mine) but your <hi>Achilles,</hi> as a ſtrong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſometimes called <hi>Achilleum argumentum,</hi> as which in this Queſtion ſeemeth to be of the moſt force and ſtrength.

            <p>For firſt, The Goſpel doth not allow that mens erroneous conſciences and perſwaſions ſhould be their rule or guide in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or any other way, but onely the Word of God.</p>

2. The Goſpel doth no where allow unto men the practiſe of Idolatry, or the open profeſſion of Errors and Hereſies:</p>
            <p n="3">3. As Chriſt hath appointed that his Goſpel ſhould be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to every creature; ſo all men are bound when and where it is preached, to be ready to heare it. It is therefore more contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Goſpel, and more deſtructive to mens Sou'es, to ſuffer them without reſtraint to continue in Idolatrous worſhip, and Hereticall wayes, than to reſtrain and compell them according to the aboveſaid order.</p>

            <p n="1">1. There are things meerly indifferent in which to enforce men to practiſe againſt their conſciences, is againſt Charity, is a breach of Chriſtian liberty, and an abuſe of Magiſtracy. For there is no breach of any command of God, in doing or not doing ſuch things, and God may be honoured and acknowledged both in his doing or not doing thereof. <hi>Rom.</hi> 146.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There be matters of leſſe moment in Religion, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantiall points of Diſcipline, or ſo, in which, who ſo diſſent, and carry their diſſent in a peaceable and humble way, are much to be born with, and no hard meaſure is to be put upon them.</p>

            <p>For firſt, The doing of the one, and the neglect of the other, are manifeſt and palpable ſins, are ſins <hi>per ſe,</hi> and in their owne nature. To ſuffer which would reflect upon the Magiſtrate, to make him guilty of the ſin, who hath power to reſtrain it and doth not. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 12.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſin that ariſes upon the doing neceſſary and main
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57802:16"/>
duties, or not doing, according to the Magiſtrates command, comes, <hi>ex accidenti,</hi> by accident, not by the nature of the thing commanded, which is not onely good in it ſelfe, but alſo a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary duty; nor by vertue of the command, which commands no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a thing manifeſtly good, and a neceſſary duty; but by the ill diſpoſition and erroneous perſwaſion of the perſon doing or not doing. And if the inforcing of neceſſary duties muſt be forborn upon this account, that ſome ſin by accident wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> enſue thereupon, how can Miniſters lawfully call upon men to pray or heare Gods Word, ſince wicked men in ſuch ſervices will rather by their ill doing of them, offend than pleaſe God? Moreover, Magiſtrates in making lawes about ſuch weighty matters, are not bound to look to particular mens conſciences and opinions, but to have an eye to Gods Word, commanding or forbidding this or that. Mens opinions and conſciences are ſecret, and not alwayes openly known, Gods Word is open and manifeſt: Mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are divers, <hi>quot homines tot ſententiae, ſo many men ſo many mindes;</hi> Gods Word is uniforme and the ſame, Mens Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would be a weak and uncertaine rule for him to goe by, Gods Word is ſure and certaine: And if Mens Conſciences accord not with Lawes in ſuch main and manifeſt matters, made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Word, it is their ſin and errour, and in ſuch caſe the Magiſtrate ought indeed to take order that they may be inſtructed and brought to the knowledge of the truth, and ſo willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto it. But if notwithſtanding they will perſiſt in Idolatrous, Hereticall, and openly Schiſmaticall wayes, ſuch wholſome Lawes muſt not give place to ſtubbornly erroneous conſciences, but they muſt ſubmit thereunto, or do juſtly ſuffer the appointed penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>Further, It is plaine, that in ſundry caſes men may be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57802:16"/>
them out of love, and with a ready minde. I may yet adde, that this dart, ſuch as it is, may be as well caſt againſt Church cenſures, as againſt this coactive exerciſe of civil Power. For it may eaſily fall out, that men in the Church, for feare of the cenſure of the Church, and eſpecially in caſe of depoſition from their Paſtorall Office, and ſo the loſſe of the maintenance they have thereby, may diſſemble their Errours, and ſubſcribe to Truth, even againſt their conſcience: A notable example of it is in ſome <hi>Arrian Biſhops, Euſebius</hi> of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> &amp; <hi>Theognis</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> who for fear of loſing their Biſhopricks, upon the decree of the <hi>Nicene Council,</hi> againſt <hi>Arrius</hi> and his Complices in deſſembling manner againſt their conſcience ſubſcribed to the decree of that Council, againſt that damnable Hereſie.</p>
            <p>If then no courſes may be uſed upon which men may be driven to act againſt their conſciences, and ſo ſin, neither can Church-cenſures, nor depoſition of H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reticall teachers be put in practiſe, upon which ſuch an inconvenience may enſue.</p>
            <p>The concluſion then is, that it is not lawfull to compell any man to doe that which is directly, and in it ſelfe ſinfull; but that a man may be compelled by lawfull authority, without any fault of theirs, to the doing of manifeſt and neceſſary duties, though in the doing thereof he ſin, and that only by his own default and evil diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>Let me yet tell you, that a man doth ſin much leſs in doing a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary good work, upon command againſt his miſinformed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, than in a willing and witting omitting of it.

And if any laid out their dear lives to purchaſe this vaſt Univerſall Liberty for themſelves and others, they ſpent their lives to no good purpoſe, and with ſmall comfort to themſelves. When we and many other peaceable Chriſtians were under the Prelaticall yoak, what Liberty would have been gratefull to us, appeared by the writings and Petitions of Non-conformiſts in thoſe dayes, which was an eaſe from the burden of Subſcription, and ſundry Ceremonies ſuperſtitious, and plainly ſuperflaous, without any endeavour to break off communion in the publique worſhip of Prayer, Hearing, and Sacraments, wherein they were willing to joyne, much more without pleading for a Toleration for all wayes in Religion, an abomination by them abhorred; or derogating from the Magiſtrates power to command in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, which they did then (as now) unanimouſly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and your Sect did eagerly oppoſe. When we are guilty of

It is true as you ſay, that truth newly ſpringing is often branded with the black cole of a Sect and Hereſie.

            <p>But now for a Concluſion, There is a capitall crime, or ſome deep plot charged on me: Your Book, ſay you, is not dated at the beginning according to the uſuall manner.

               </note> were by when the book was in printing, and gave any order about its dating: It is dated as all other books be in the beginning and as your own noting, the party for whom it was printed, and the yeare when it was printed, though not the moneth, nor day of the moneth, which is is not uſually noted. 2. The long diſtance between the date of the Epiſtle and the Books coming forth may ſhew indeed (and that is the plaine truth) that it was long ere I could prevaile with the Stationer to undertake the printing of it, and the ſlow going on of the Preſs.</p>

               <hi>A briefe and ſolid Exercitation concerning the Coercive Power of the Magiſtrate in matters of Religion, by a reverend and learned Miniſter, Mr.</hi> George Petter, <hi>deceaſed, lately of</hi> Bread <hi>in</hi> Suſſex.</head>

            <p n="1">1. But <hi>Rom.</hi> 134. He is the Miniſter of God for the good of his Subjects, that is, to procure and provide for their good and welfare. Now the chief good of his Subjects is their ſpirituall good, the good of their ſoules: and how doth he provide for this, if he ſuffer them to neglect and omit the duties of Gods worſhip, and the ordinary meanes of their ſalvation, and doe not compell them to perform and to uſe the ſame?</p>
            <p n="2">2. But 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 2. 2. One end for which we are commanded to pray for thoſe that are in authority, is this, that we may under them, and by their meanes, lead our lives in all godlineſſe. Whence it followes, that it is the Magiſtrates duty by his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to provide that Subjects may live under him in all godlineſs. And how can he be ſaid to do this, if he do not by his power take order that they may duly performe the maine duties of piety commanded by God?</p>
            <p n="3">3. That from the example and practiſe of ſome of the religious King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the like Covenant, by the authority of <hi>Aſa,</hi> was made by his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ver. 12. <hi>They entred into a covenant to ſeek the Lord God of their fathers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that whoſoever would not ſeek the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhould be put to death,</hi> &amp;c. This was a compulſion in an high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That, If a Maſter of a Family may and ought to compell his Family, yea and Strangers too, coming or being in his houſe, to the outward ſanctifying of the Sabbath, at leaſt to keep them from prophaning it, as appeares by the Fourth Commandement: then may a Magiſtrate do the like, according as is read of, and commanded in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> cap. 13 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>1. Obj. <hi>If the Magiſtrate compell his Subjects to doe things against their conſcience, or which they in their conſciences are perſwaded to be unlawfull for them to doc, then he compells them to ſin.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. If on the other ſide the foreſaid perſwaſion doe proceed from an obſtinate conſcience, as thoſe that have had the meanes of teaching, and have been ſufficiently convinced of the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the things enjoyned by authority of the Magiſtrate, and yet doe obſtinately perſiſt in refuſing to doe them, then the Magiſtrate compelling them to outward conformity in doing the dutyes enjoyned, doth not compell them to ſin, but uſeth th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

thereby to reclaime them from it, and from their contempt and neglect of Gods ordinances.</p>
            <p>Now this the Magiſtrate may and ought to doe: For <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. it is ſaid, <hi>He beareth not the ſword in vaine,</hi> and is therewith to puniſh evil doers; but ſurely they are evil doers, who do wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly even againſt the light of their Conſcience<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
