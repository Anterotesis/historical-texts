            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THE Pious Author ſent this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe to the Preſs ſome time ſince; but before it was finiſhed, it pleaſed God to take him out of a ſtate of great Tryals and Afflictions, into a ſtate of Glory and Happineſs; ſo that his Friends may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain this as a</hi> Funeral Sermon, <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by his own hand; in the ſerious reading of which, they will find that he experimentally felt, and truly practis'd the ſubſtance of this Book,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That he found a great deal of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in ſanctified Afflictions; and that as his outward man decayed, ſo his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man was</hi> renewed day by day.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the light and ſhort Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Life did work for him</hi> a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory.</p>

                  <q>For which cauſe we faint not; but though our outward Man periſh, yet our inner Man is renewed day by day.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>IN theſe words we have a Divine Cordial to prevent the fainting of God's People, under the troubles of this Life; commended to us, from the experience of the Apoſtles and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians. For although the words may
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34230:8"/>
have a reference to what goeth before, unto-ſome other grounds and means of comfort and ſupport which they had (as I have largely diſcourſed of elſewhere) beſides this; yet this was one ground of their comfort and ſupport, that they gained by their loſſes; Their Souls proſpered, while their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies waſted; what they loſt in the outward Man, they gained in the inward Man, and for this cauſe they fainted not: and wherever this is found by experience, it will be a ground of ſupport and comfort. Now that this truth of God (ſo proper and pertinent to my preſent Condition, which is a periſhing of my outward Man) may be a mean to ſupport and uphold me, to the praiſe of my God: I have pitcht my thoughts upon it, and humbly begging the gracious aſſiſtance of his Holy Spirit, that I may rightly underſtand the mind of God in it, and rightly apply it to my own Soul, and may find and feel the power of it, and by Faith ſuck out the ſweetneſs of it, to my ſupport and conſolation: now ſeeing thoſe evil days are come upon me, wherein I may truly ſay, I have no Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in them; praying alſo, that theſe my Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations on this Text may be uſeful to them into whoſe hands they may ſall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Doctrinal Concluſion I obſerve from the Won is,</hi>

               <p n="1">1. That in Man there are two Parts, an outward and an inward Man; and what theſe are.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:34230:8"/>
2. That the outward Man is ſubject to declining, decaying and periſhing; it cannot be avoided nor prevented, but it muſt be ſo: and that the inward Man is capable of increaſing, growing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the decaying, decreaſing and periſhing of the outward Man, in gracious Perſons, through the great Goodneſs and Grace of God, tendeth unto the increaſing and renewing of the: inward Man; and what influence the one hath upon the other to effect the ſame.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That this is the Comfort and the Character of truly gracious Souls.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that there is an outward Man is obvious to ſenſe: That we have Bodies of fleſh and blood and bone is evident enough: This is the Shell, the Carcaſe, the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

of it: Animal-life, Livelyhood, Bodily, Endowments and Comforts; Health, Strength, Beauty, Eaſe, Liberty, Friends, Relations, Eſtate, and whatſoever tends to the outward Wellfare of the Body; Food, Phyſick, Recreation, Reſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By <hi>the inner Man,</hi> I underſtand the Soul and all its faculties, the Spiritual, in viſible part of Man, and all the concernments and accommodations of it; and all that conduceth to the Life and Livelyhood of the Soul; to the Preſervation, Health, Strength, Safety, Liberty and Advantage of it; all its Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Comforts; all that belongs to the <hi>inner Man,</hi> to its Being, and well-being.</p>
               <p>As for the Qualities of both, they are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As for the Body, ſimply and ſingly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the fleſh and blood, the Scripture gives us many Epithetes of it: as, <hi>Houſes of Clay, Earthly Tabernacles, Duſt and Aſhes, earthen veſſels,</hi> &amp;c. And theſe Bodies are.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Vile bodies. Phil.</hi> 3. 21. becauſe made of vile and baſe materials; ſubject to vile diſeaſes; to vile abuſes; to vile abominations; and to a vile diſſolution at laſt; ſowen indiſhonour, ſhall end in Corruption; great hinderances to the Soul many waies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>outward Man</hi> is the mortal Man, that of Neceſſity muſt dye and return to duſt, from whence it came; this cannot poſſibly live alway: There is an irreverſible Sentence of Death paſt upon it <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. 27. and for theſe reaſons, the Body is the worſt part of Man; the worſt by far; and ſhould be leaſt eſteemed: and ſuch as is the Body, even ſuch are all bodily Comforts and Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations; Health, Strength, Beauty, Liberty, Friends, Honours, Eſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all mortal, mutable, decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fading, dying things: daily experience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth this: I need ſay no more.</p>

2. But for the <hi>inner Man,</hi> the Soul, that is 1. Precious; ſo precious, that it is more worth than all the World. <hi>Math.</hi> 16. 26. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 8. having the bleſſed Image of the glorious God ſtamped on it at firſt; being capable of knowing and injoying the true and living God; and when ſin had ſpoil'd and captivated it, it could not be redeemed, but by the precious Blood of the Son of God. So are all the Concernments of the Soul precious alſo. 2. It is immortal alſo; it never dies, it lives for ever: None can, nothing can kill the Soul; that is, cauſe it not to be: and for theſe reaſons, it is the nobleſt, chiefeſt and beſt part of Man; and hence alſo the Concernments of the Soul are more excellent, more noble and precious than thoſe of the <hi>outward Man;</hi> the Graces and Comforts, the Strength and Beauty of the Soul; the Priviledges, and Peace, and Wellfare of the Soul are more excellent and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as will more appear in the next particular.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing to be conſidered is, That the <hi>outward Man</hi> is ſubject to decline and periſh. The Body it ſelf; all its Beauty, Strength, Health, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is ſubject to decay. The Bodies, even of the beſt Saints, that ſhall one day be made like unto Chriſt's glorious Body, are ſubject to vile Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>What is become of <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Strength, and <hi>Saul</hi>'s Beauty? <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>David</hi> will tell us of their decays in all theſe; their Friends, Eſtates, Relations; their Health, and all their outward Comforts fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them; and how can we poſſibly hope, that we ſhall keep them? All outward things are dying Vanities; we are all of us travelling to the Land of forgetfulneſs. They that live longeſt, go the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt

in all things like unto Chriſt; <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 12, 13. The Soul, the <hi>inner Man,</hi> may, and muſt get more ſtrength againſt Corruption and Temptation; it muſt get more Victory over the World, and over it ſelf; it muſt grow in ſelf-denyal, in faith, in patience, in hope, in Communion with God; it muſt increaſe in knowledge and experience; it muſt get nearer God; and more weaned from the World, and better prepared to put off this earthly Tabernacle of the Body: Wherefore is the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an train'd up in Chriſt's Schools, his School of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and of Providences; but that the Soul, the <hi>inner Man,</hi> may be made better? That Grace may grow; for it is the Growth of Grace, that evidenceth the Truth of it. And why doth our heavenly Father chaſtiſe us in our outward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, but to better us in our <hi>inward Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, before I proceed, let me pauſe a little, and commune with my own heart: O my Soul! Thou haſt been under the blaſtings and witherings of thy <hi>outward Man;</hi> theſe many years thou haſt been in the School of Correction: Thy God hath made many breaches upon thy earthly Comforts; ſtript thee of thy deareſt Relations, of thy Liberty, of thy Eſtate, of opportunities of ſerving thy God in thy place; deprived thee of thy Health and Strength, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet hath he dealt with thee, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely better than thy Sins have deſerved. It is his mercy thou art not conſumed; not in Hell, not in thy Grave: but O my Soul! what art thou the better for all thoſe ſtroaks upon thy <hi>outward Man?</hi> What haſt thou gained by all thy loſſes? It is true, Afflictions are dry Rods, and my heart, a dead heart; there can be no bloſſoms, nor fruit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God's Bleſſing, and the Word and Spirit's working in and by Affliction: but what bleſſing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34230:11"/>
upon all thy troubles canſt thou diſcern? What good to the <hi>inner Man</hi> have theſe afflictions done thee? Art thou more ſenſible of the evil of Sin? more weary of it, and more grieved with it? Is thy Heart more tender, thy Spirit more humble, thy will more ſubdued to Gods will? Art thou more Crucified to the Creature; thy inordinate Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons mortified; thy unruly Paſſions ſubdued? Art thou more meek and patient? Are thy Affections raiſed, and more inlarged after God, and Chriſt, and Heaven? Is Jeſus Chriſt more precious to thee? And doſt thou pant and thirſt more after the manifeſtations of his Love to thy Soul? Art thou more watchful over thy thoughts, words and actions? More careful to pleaſe God, more fearful to diſpleaſe him? More tender of his Honour? More ſenſible of the Afflictions of <hi>Joſeph?</hi> More di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in holy Duties? More frequent in Self exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, in heavenly Meditation, in heavenly diſcourſe? Art thou, O my Soul, aſhamed of, and grieved for thy former Miſcarriages, thy miſ-ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time, Breath, Liberty, Strength? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> More diligent in preparing for thy Diſſolution; and more contented with thy preſent Condition? Doſt thou endeavour now to go to the Fountain for all Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies? And doſt thou labour with all thy might, in the ſtrength of God, to make up all thy loſſes and breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in God, and in his Covenant through Chriſt? Doſt thou prize the promiſes, and laboureſt to live upon them by Faith? Is God and Chriſt more in thy thoughts and affections than heretofore? And doſt thou labour to get out the bleſſing of thy Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and art moſt earneſt with God for the bleſſing? Doſt thou labour to caſt all thy care upon God, and to truſt him with all? If any of theſe things appears, let God have all the Glory; and bleſſed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34230:11"/>
be God for any weak deſires after theſe ſweet Fruits. Deny not what God hath done for thee; but be aſhamed and grieved, that thou art no better: Cry to God mightily, wreſtle with him for his bleſſing upon thy afflictions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Particular is, That the Decaying and Periſhing of the <hi>outward Man</hi> to God's people, tends to the ſtrengthning, the proſpering and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the <hi>inner Man.</hi> The Adverſity of the Body proves the Proſperity of the Soul, to all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Perſons, and to them only. The Soul and Body of a Saint, is like the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Saul;</hi> as the one grows weaker and weaker, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grows ſtronger and ſtronger; and where it is ſo, there is good ground of Comfort under all outward troubles; and where it is not ſo, there is little ground of Comfort for the preſent: although, there may be a growing in the Soul, when it is not diſcerned; as there is of the Babe in the Womb, and of the Corn in the Earth, under the Clods; both grow, even when they are not diſcerned; but in due time will appear. But more of this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.</p>

Uſually, Proſperity begets Pride; and Pride ſets us at a diſtance from God; God reſiſteth the proud: he ſees the proud afar off. Chriſtians are never ſo far from God, as when they are neareſt to their outward Comforts and Enjoyments. God is then but in few of their thoughts: Now it is the Preſence or Abſence of God, that makes Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Winter in the Soul; as it is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and abſence of the Sun that makes Summer and Winter on the Earth. Now, if Proſperity does withdraw our hearts from God, (as too often it doth) it cauſeth God to withdraw from us, (though we may not find him wanting while earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Comforts continue with us) it muſt needs do us a great deal of hurt; for if God withdraw or withold the influences of his Grace from us, our Souls muſt needs be in a ſickly and languiſhing condition! How weak and feeble muſt we be, when God doth not continue his Grace to us? Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lies betwixt God and our Souls; which we all know by woful Experience: and our God, our gracious Father knows it, and therefore, in tender love to our Souls, many times breaks our outward Proſperity, that our Souls may not be drown'd in it; and periſh by it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The welfare of the <hi>outward Man</hi> hinders the <hi>inner Man</hi> from that ſerious, diligent, hearty intent, and Spiritual Service, that it ſhould perform to God: in which the Soul might have had many ſweet meetings with God, and many Communications of Love and Grace from him; which, through the defects of his duties, are ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended from him. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 64. 5. and this muſt needs tend to the weakning of the Soul. What Strength, Life, Comfort, have God's People found in holy Duties? How have their Souls been refreſht, their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34230:13"/>
Hearts raiſed, and quickned, and enlarged after God many times? but then they have been ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, earneſt, fervent in Spirit in theſe Duties. Now in Proſperity, what careleſs, heartleſs ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice do we perform? How ſoon weary? ſecretly glad when the work is over? How ready upon the leaſt occaſion to neglect a Duty, or an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance? Not ſo fearful to diſpenſe with ſome Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that God calls for; nor ſo fearful to draw nigh a Temptation. O, how cold, dead, and heartleſs are we in Duty? All this is too true, O my Soul, ſee it, lament and bewail; and bleſs the Lord for time to do it, and bleſs him more for an heart to do it.</p>
               <p>What bad ſervice did <hi>Manaſſes</hi> do to God? Or, rather what great ſervice did he do the Devil, when he was in his proſperity? never minding his God, or his Soul, till his outward man periſhed.</p>
               <p>3ly, It hinders communion with God, which is the very life of gracious Souls, their Heaven upon Earth: Communion with God in holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and holy Duties; as Prayer, Praiſes, Meditation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is that which fattens and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpereth the Souls of God's people; but outward proſperity hinders communion with God in theſe; for then, even while outward comforts are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, God, and his company, and preſence, are not ſo much ſound wanting, nor ſo much valued, deſired, and panted after, as in a barren Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, where no waters of worldly comforts are, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 64. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 42. 1, 2, 3. When <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was in great ſtraits, ſtript of his earthly Comforts, bedewed all with Tears; then his Soul panted after God: when he was in the Valley of <hi>Baca,</hi> then he looks unto the Mountains of Myrrh, the Garden of Spices, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 84. 1, 2, 3, 4. Is it not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34230:13"/>
ſo with God's People? when their Liberty, Friends, Health, Eſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are gone; then God is ſought for, and communion with him, earneſtly longed and thirſted for, more than ever; and then uſually moſt enjoyed.</p>
               <p>By Acts of Communion with God, Souls con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, commerce, and trade with God, trade in Heaven, and that turns greatly to their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: We can never take a Voyage to Heaven by Prayer or Meditation, but it will turn to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count firſt or laſt; ſome gain to our Souls will accrue by every act of communion: We cannot touch Chriſt by our Faith or Love, but ſome Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue will flow from him to our Souls, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 145. 18. <hi>God will fulfil the deſires of them that fear him: He will ſatisfie the hungry with good things. Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs.</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry groan of a gracious Soul after Grace, every pant and breathing after God in truth, is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and recorded in Heaven. Mal. 3. 16. <hi>A book of remembrance for them that thought upon his Name.</hi> O, the tranſcendent goodneſs of our moſt gracious God, to take notice of ſuch poor things! <hi>He will not deſpiſe the day of ſmall things:</hi> and what an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement is this to us, to ſpend our moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thoughts on God: But Proſperity in the World, doth ſtop and interrupt the Soul's converſe and trade with God; by eſtranging the heart from God and heavenly things, and ſo it becomes very prejudicial to the proſperity of the inward man. It is very hard for a man to have much of the World in his hands, and much of Heaven in his heart alſo: to have much converſe with, and much enjoyment of Creature-comforts, and to have his Converſation in Heaven too. And when do our Souls thrive and flouriſh beſt, but when we
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34230:14"/>
are trading above, converſing with God?</p>
               <p>Now theſe great Miſchiefs, I have named, to the <hi>inner man,</hi> are promoted by the proſperity of the <hi>outward man;</hi> thus:</p>
               <p n="1">1. By making us forgetful of thoſe things that we ſhould neceſſarily remember, in order to the good of our Souls: Proſperity ſpoils the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exceedingly, as to heavenly and ſpiritual things, and that in theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Proſperity</hi> breeds, 1. Forgetfulneſs of God, the chief good; and ſurely that Soul can never thrive that forgets God, who is the Fountain of all its Life, Grace, and Comfort. The remembrance of <hi>God</hi> brought ſweetneſs and ſatisfaction to <hi>David</hi>'s Soul, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 63. 5, 6. but Proſperity makes us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of <hi>God; Deut.</hi> 6. 11, 12. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 14, 19, 20. Yea, fulneſs of outward things makes men to deny <hi>God;</hi> of which good <hi>Agur</hi> was afraid, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb.</hi> 30. 9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Forgetful of their beſt part, their Souls; the Soul is then moſtly forgotten, when the Body is moſtly minded.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Forgetful of their Duties to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man;</hi> ſo it was with <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s Butler.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Of the Affliction of <hi>Joſeph, Amos</hi> 6. 6. When we our ſelves are at liberty, how apt are we to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get them that are in Bonds.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Of Sin; that uſually is moſt remembred in time of Affliction, as in <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Of <hi>God's Word,</hi> that is too much forgotten in Proſperity; the Precepts of <hi>God</hi> not obeyed, nor the Promiſes ſo reliſhed and believed, not Threatnings feared.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Proſperity makes us forgetful of Death, Judgment, the World to come, Eternity: The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Day is put far off.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:34230:14"/>
All theſe Seven Things ſhould be always remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by us, and have our frequent Thoughts and Meditations; for the remembrance of them is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry advantageous to the welfare of the <hi>inner man,</hi> and will tend to the good of our Souls; but the flouriſhing of the <hi>outward man</hi> breeds too much forgetfulneſs of all theſe things; and the forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of theſe things, drives us from <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> from us, keeps us at a diſtance from him, caſts him out of our Minds and Thoughts, makes us unſerviceable to him, and hinders our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him.</p>
               <p>2ly. The flouriſhing of the <hi>outward man</hi> begets Pride, Wantonneſs, Security, Envy, Ambition, Contention, negligence in <hi>God's</hi> Service, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of others, and many hurtful Luſts, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 15. Experience proves this.</p>
               <p>3ly. It conſumes precious Time and Strength, waſtes the Spirits, Thoughts, and Affections, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed on earthly things, which ſhould all be ſpent on <hi>God</hi> principally, and but ſo much on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, as may fit us for his Service, and in ſubordination to him: But while men are contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving how to get, how to manage, how to ſpend, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This fills up their Time, Hearts, Thoughts, Minds, Spirits and all; ſo that there is no place nor room left for <hi>God,</hi> or the concerns of their Souls: Therefore the <hi>wife God</hi> in great Love and Mercy to the Souls of his People, breaks their <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Proſperity,</hi> which otherwiſe would ruine their Souls, removing thoſe things that hinder the welfare of the Soul; for when outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity is gone, then the Soul flies to <hi>God,</hi> it draws nigh to <hi>God.</hi> Proſperity kept it at a diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; it forgot <hi>God</hi> before, now it remembers him, ſeeks <hi>God</hi> early, ſerves him diligently: Now
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34230:15"/>
it ſeeks communion with <hi>God,</hi> pants after his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and the ſenſe of his Love: Now the Soul is awakened and enlightned, and now it remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers <hi>God,</hi> and it ſelf, and <hi>Sion,</hi> and its former miſcarriages; it now minds Death and Eternity more ſeriouſly than ever, and is more diligent in preparation for them; and now the Soul that lay languiſhing and pining before, while the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man</hi> flouriſhed, begins to be in a thriving way; for theſe things promote the welfare of the Soul. And this is the firſt way, how the periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>outward man</hi> help towards the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtrengthning of the <hi>inner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Adverſity of the <hi>outward man</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes the Proſperity of the <hi>inner,</hi> by being a means of bringing in Light and Conviction into the Soul: Proſperity ſhuts Men's Eyes, and deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens their Ears; but <hi>vexatio dat viſum,</hi> Affliction opens Men's Eyes, ſo that they ſee what they did not before; and they ſee things otherwiſe than before: dark Diſpenſations bring Light with them. Afflictions put <hi>God's</hi> People upon the ſearch. <hi>Lamen.</hi> 3. 40. Then they retire and look within themſelves; then they find out the filthineſs, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, frowardneſs, pride, earthlineſs of their own hearts, more than ever they ſaw before; then they find and feel their Spiritual Wants, Diſeaſes, Dangers, the treachery, falſeneſs, deceitfulneſs of their own Hearts; their often grieving, quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reſiſting of <hi>God's Spirit</hi> in time of <hi>Proſperity;</hi> their inordinate Self-love, Fleſh-pleaſing, and Gratifyings: then they ſee their former ſpiritual ſloth and negligence, their backwardneſs to, and wearineſs in <hi>God's Service;</hi> their formality, dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, cuſtomarineſs in holy Duties; their impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of reproof; their haſtineſs of Spirit, their
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34230:15"/>
want of tenderneſs towards, and of ſympathy with thoſe that were afflicted; not weeping with thoſe that wept; their cenſuring and judging others; their want of Charity: then they ſee how badly they improved their healthful and youthful time; their Talents, and their Enjoyments, with many other Evils are diſcovered.</p>
               <p>As alſo in times of <hi>Affliction,</hi> there is a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the vanity and emptineſs of the Creature: when all Comforts of Life fail; as Health, Wealth, Friends, Liberty, Eſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then the Soul is convinced of the vanity and uncertainty of all theſe: The Rod diſcovers both Heart and Life, and what the Creature is; And alſo, then the Souls of <hi>God's People</hi> come to ſee the ſurpaſſing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of the <hi>Promiſes,</hi> and of the great Importance of the things of the World to come; O, now the Soul can prize an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in <hi>God,</hi> and in his <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Covenant:</hi> and is hereupon ſtirred up to mind <hi>God</hi> more, and Heaven more; and to beſtir it ſelf in the uſe of all Means, and to get Aſſurance of an Intereſt in <hi>God.</hi> Now all this tends very much to the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the <hi>inner man;</hi> and if we well and wiſely conſider this Benefit which our merciful Father grants us, by blaſting and withering our <hi>outward Comforts;</hi> thus to enlighten and convince us of all thoſe things, we ſhall have cauſe to Adore and Admire his Goodneſs towards us, in taking ſuch courſe with us, and to cry out with <hi>Job</hi> 7. 17, 18. <hi>What is man that thou ſhouldeſt magnifie him? and that thou ſhouldeſt ſet thy heart upon him? and that thou ſhouldeſt viſit him every morning, and try him every moment?</hi>

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Adverſity of the <hi>outward man</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes the Proſperity of the <hi>inner man,</hi> by taking away the <hi>Idols of the Soul,</hi> which divided the Soul from <hi>God:</hi> The beſt of us are apt to make <hi>Idols</hi> of every Creature-enjoyment, very apt to let out our Hearts in inordinate Affection to Huſbands, Wives, Children, <hi>&amp;</hi> c. and ſuffer them to have more of our Hearts, Loves, and Delights, than <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Heaven;</hi> over-prizing and over-loving them; taking too much content in them, and expecting too much from them; and ſo make <hi>Idols</hi> of them; and then <hi>God</hi> withdraws his gracious Influences from us, thoſe quickning ſtrengthning, and comfortable Influences of his Spirit from us, and hides his face; and then our poor Souls languiſh, and we grow weak and feeble; ſo it was with <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 30. 6, 7. but this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of <hi>God</hi> from us, we do not many time perceive and feel, while our earthly Comfort continue with us; though our Graces be weak Faith and Love weak, our Paſſions and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſtrong, and are too often too hard for us, and we are carried captive by them; and although w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Comforts continue with us; but then it pleaſed our gracious <hi>God</hi> to ſend ſome awakening Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences upon us, he ſends Adverſity, and remove theſe our <hi>Idols;</hi> and then through <hi>God's</hi> aſſiſting Grace we come to ſee our ſin, and the fruits of it
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34230:16"/>
then we ſee our folly, in letting out of our Hearts upon the vain Creature, and that then <hi>God</hi> did withdraw, and that our Souls did wither and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh; upon which, by the ſpecial Grace of <hi>God,</hi> we lament our folly, beg forgiveneſs through the blood of Chriſt; and the Lord, being gracious and merciful, returns to the Soul again; and then the Soul begins to recover it ſelf, and to grow better.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Adverſity is a means of bringing afreſh to our Remembrance thoſe particular ſpecial Sins which in Proſperity were forgot; and which, while they lye on us without Repentance, they waſte and weaken, hurt and corrupt our Souls. <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> (as was ſaid before) puts <hi>God's</hi> People upon the ſearch of their Hearts and Lives: now they ſay unto themſelves, what have we done? now their Spirits do, or ſhould make diligent ſearch; now they do, or ſhould commune with their own Hearts, and examine their ways, and ſeek for the plague of their Hearts; their <hi>Dali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah's,</hi> their <hi>Jonah's,</hi> their darling, their beloved Sins, which they did not, or would not ſee in their Proſperity, nor were willing to be reproved for, but did over-look them, or forgot them, or look'd on them as little ones, and common Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, humane Frailties; and could ſtudy ſhifts to cover and excuſe them: Such as Pride and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, inordinate Affection, Unthankfulneſs, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, Covetouſneſs, Selfiſhneſs, vain Thoughts, idle Words, Omiſſions, Unfaithfulneſs, breaking Vows and Promiſes; Earthly mindedneſs, Security, hardneſs of Heart, unprofitableneſs under the means of Grace, and many other Heart-evils that ſcarce

And from that very moment, ſhe was filled with joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and walked very chearfully and comfortably ſeveral Months, even until <hi>God</hi> took her unto himſelf.

The laſt particular propoſed, was, that, for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to be renewed in the <hi>inner Man</hi> when the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man</hi> doth decay and periſh, is the Character and Comfort of gracious Perſons. That it is their Character, appears, becauſe the contrary is true of wicked Perſons; they are curs'd in Soul, when
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:34230:21"/>
croſs'd in Body; their outward periſhings prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward periſhings alſo; for then, uſually they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur and repine; fret againſt <hi>God</hi> and Inſtruments; then, they think of ſinful ſhifts and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful means to get out of trouble; when their <hi>outward Man</hi> is hurt by affliction, they hurt their Souls by ſin; by impatience and diſcontent, as that wicked King, who ſaid, what, ſhall I wait upon <hi>God</hi> any longer? but now we find the ſervants of the Lord, as <hi>Eli, David, Job, Micah, Habakkuk</hi> and others, when their outward comforts failed them, then they ſubmitted to the will of <hi>God,</hi> fled to him for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, truſted in him, and ſo by the exerciſe of their Faith and Patience, their Souls were ſupported and ſtrengthned. <hi>David</hi> expreſsly confeſſeth that it was good for him, that is, for his Soul, his <hi>inner Man,</hi> that he was afflicted. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 71.

               <p>And this is the comfort alſo of <hi>God</hi>'s People, that their greateſt outward evils, through the goodneſs and bleſſing of <hi>God,</hi> turn to their greateſt inward good: and this makes them rejoyce in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and glory in tribulations; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2. to wit, becauſe of the Spiritual benefit they receive by afflictions, and upon this very ground, <hi>God</hi> gives that command, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 12. <hi>Wherefore lift up the hands that hang down:</hi> that is, therefore be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and encouraged.

                     <hi>First,</hi> Hence it appears, that there is a great difference between the Godly and Ungodly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to afflictions, between the upright and the hypocrite: The godly are the better, the wicked are the worſe for affliction. The godly Man gains in his <hi>inner Man,</hi> by his loſſes in his <hi>outward Man</hi> but the wicked in their afflictions commit more wickedneſs, and their Corruptions break out more to the ruine of their Souls: The Righteous hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on his way, altho' Briers and Thorns, yea, Lyons be in his way, that tear and ſpoil all his outward Comforts; and he that hath clean Hand and a clean Heart, groweth ſtronger and ſtronger even when his <hi>outward Man</hi> grows weaker and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: <hi>Job</hi> 17. 9.

                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Then, a gracious perſon hath more and better ground of Patience, quietneſs and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation under all his afflictions than a wicked Perſon hath; becauſe every gracious Perſon hath good ground to hope, believe and conclude, that, his good <hi>God</hi> is doing him good, doing his Soul good, by all the troubles on his <hi>outward Man;</hi> and having ground to hope, believe and conclude ſo, he hath good ground of Patience and Contentation. Now a Child of <hi>God</hi> hath good ground to hope, believe and conclude ſo; becauſe he hath the faithful word of the true and faithful God, for to ground his Hope and Faith upon; who hath ſaid, that all things ſhall work together for good to his People: if all things, then afflictions; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. And that all things are theirs; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22, 23. things preſent, all their preſent ſufferings and troubles are theirs; that is, ſhall work for their Spiritual good: and <hi>God</hi>'s word tells us expreſly, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. 10. that all our chaſtiſements are for our profit, our greateſt profit; namely, to make us partakers of <hi>God</hi>'s Holineſs; to purge away our Sins, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 9. to make us conformable to Chriſt: and to fit and prepare us for that far more exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eternal weight of Glory, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. Here we have a ſure word of Promiſe; the <hi>God</hi> of Truth, who cannot Lye, the Almighty <hi>God,</hi> (who is able to perform his promiſes; which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes flow from his everlaſting Love and unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able goodneſs &amp; mercy, and are founded in the full ſatisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt, in whom they are

made, and through whom they ſhall be fulfilled; to aſſure us of the truth of them.) I ſay the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty <hi>God</hi> hath engaged his word, that all the ſufferings of his Children ſhall work for the good of their Souls; which is a moſt firm ground of Patience, Contentation and Conſolation to them. When I can believe and be perſwaded in my Soul, that all my afflictions ſhall promote the welfare of my Soul, I have all the reaſon in the World to be patient and content under them: Our great care muſt be to look to this, that we be the Heirs of the Promiſes; and if we be in Chriſt, really united to Chriſt, grafted into him, made partakers of his Spirit, Life, and Grace; then are we the Heirs of the Promiſes, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 17, 18. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. laſt: and we being the Heirs of the promiſes, we have grounds of Patience, becauſe <hi>God</hi> hath promiſed all ſhall work for our good: and then next, that we may be able with patience to bear our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we muſt labour to keep theſe promiſes ſtill in our eyes, looking to them, and to the love, goodneſs, faithfulneſs and all-ſufficiency of <hi>God</hi> in them, and looking unto Jeſus, through whoſe ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and mediation they come to us, and labouring to keep our Eyes, the Eyes of Faith and Hope, fixed on thoſe promiſes, truſting in <hi>God,</hi> and relying upon him; and ſo ſhall we be able in our Patience to poſſeſs our Souls: and Patience will do us great ſervice in affliction, for altho' it cannot keep us from miſery, it will keep us from being miſerable: for we can never be miſerable, ſo long as we have an intereſt in Chriſt, and through him, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. Now Faith in the promiſes is both the breeder and feeder of Patience, let Faith live, and Patience will not dye: let Faith be preſent, and Patience will not be abſent; and through Faith
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34230:23"/>
and Patience we ſhall inherit the promiſes. Oh, then, let us labour to live by Faith, and ſtrive to keep up our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>Certainly it is every ones concernment, to know and conſider, that Man conſiſts of two Parts, the <hi>inner</hi> and <hi>outer Man,</hi> and which of the two is beſt, and ought to be moſt minded, and principally looked after? for moſt live, as if they had Bodies only, and no Souls; or, if they have Souls, that they need not much minding, but ſay, they leave the care of them to <hi>God:</hi> whereas indeed, it is the welfare, the ſafety and ſalvation of our Souls, that we all ſhould be moſt ſolicious about. <hi>What ſhall it profit a Man</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>if he gain the whole World, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that when our merciful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the only wiſe <hi>God,</hi> ſees, that the blaſtings and breakings of our outward Comforts, are proper means to keep us from, and to purge from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

therefore uſeth this means, what cauſe have we to endeavour in <hi>God</hi>'s ſtrength, patiently, quietly and comfortably, to bear all our breaches and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of our <hi>outward Man?</hi> yea, and to praiſe and bleſs the Lord, that he will take this courſe with us, thus to chaſten us here in this World, that we may not be condemned with the World hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 32.</p>

This fully believed, and ſeriouſly conſidered, would unglue our affections from theſe things, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare us to part with them; that our parting with them be not ſo grievous to us, as uſually it is. Could we uſe theſe things as we do our Gloves on our Hands, which we can with eaſe pluck off; and not as the ſkin on our Hands, which cannot be pulled off but with much pain and ſmart. It were good wiſdom for us often to look on all our earthly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, as things that we cannot long enjoy; as things that we muſt needs ſhortly part with; this my health, my eſtate, my eaſe, my relations, I muſt part with, and I know not how ſoon, a parting time muſt come: This Soul and Body muſt part, and to keep ſuch thoughts in our minds, and often to conſider of it, would help to moderate our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to them while we enjoy them, and to imploy them for <hi>God,</hi> and alſo it would prevent our immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ſorrow for the loſs of them, becauſe we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſuch loſſes, and made account of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came: but we are too often ſurpriſed, and therefore too often overcome with ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It follows from the premiſes, that the Servants of <hi>God</hi> have no true cauſe or reaſon to be diſcouraged, diſquieted or dejected, when their <hi>outward Man</hi> periſheth, their outward Comforts wither, their old Houſe begins to totter and decay; becauſe by all theſe witherings and periſhings of their <hi>outward Man,</hi> their <hi>inner Man</hi> is renewed day by day; and therefore, no cauſe of fainting.</p>
                  <p>Such as know, that is, are aſſured by Faith, that when this their earthly Tabernacle ſhall be diſſolved,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34230:25"/>
that they have a building with <hi>God,</hi> an Houſe not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens, ſuch will not be troubled when their Houſes of Clay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to totter; no, but rather, they groan earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be cloathed upon with their Houſe which is from Heaven. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3. And that <hi>God</hi>'s Servants may thus be willing to put off their earthly Tabernacles, and exchange them for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Houſes. <hi>God</hi> is working upon them, and in them, this willingneſs, as <hi>Verſe</hi> 5, by his Spirit, his Word, and by his Chaſtiſements, breaking and blafting their earthly Comforts, weakning their bodies, to make them willing to leave them, and to long for thoſe everlaſting habitations, which their dear Lord hath prepared for them; <hi>John</hi> 14. 1, 2, 3. And for the more effectual working of <hi>God</hi>'s People to this willingneſs, he gives unto them the earneſt of the Spirit, which is the earneſt of their Inheritance, untill the Redemption of the purchaſed Poſſeſſion, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13, 14. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23. We which have received the Firſt-fruits of the Spirit groan within our ſelves, waiting for the Adoption, to wit, the Redemption of our Bodies.</p>
                  <p>Now this Earneſt or Firſt-fruits of the Spirit, which in ſome meaſure <hi>God</hi> gives to all his people here in this life, to prepare them for Glory, is called alſo the Seal of the Spirit, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>After ye believed, ye were ſealed.</hi> Now, this Seal of the Spirit, I take to be, the ſaving Works, Graces and Fruits of the Spirit in us; as the Work of true and ſound illumination, true Conviction of our Sin and Miſery, and of the Creatures Vanity; of our own impotency and utter inſufficiency to help <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

unto him, and are heartily willing to take him for their onely Lord and Saviour; all this is the work of the Spirit: As alſo, ſound Converſion from all Sin unto God, as the chief good; the Spirit enabling the Soul to repent and turn to <hi>God;</hi> and alſo working in the Soul the Grace of Faith, enabling it to come to Chriſt, to receive him, accept of him, reſt upon him, and to reſign it ſelf up ſincerely to him and to his Government, by his Word and Spirit. The Spirit works San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification in the Soul, deſtroying the old corrupt Principles of Nature, and implanting new Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of ſpiritual Life, making it partaker of the Divine Nature; mortifying in it the luſts of the fleſh, and quickning it to newneſs of life; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the Image of <hi>God</hi> upon it, and working all thoſe other Graces, which are the Conditions of Pardon and Juſtification; as true love to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to his Word and People; true Fear of <hi>God,</hi> ſorrow for, and hatred of Sin; producing thoſe Fruits mentioned, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5. 22, 23. as <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, Meekneſs, Humility,</hi> and the like. Alſo the Spirit helps the Soul to act thoſe Graces, and to perform thoſe Duties required of us, in order to our Salvation: It guides and leads, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, helps our Infirmities, teacheth us to pray, and carrieth on the whole work of Sanctification in us. And this I take to be the Seal of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; when thoſe ſaving Impreſſions and Habits of Grace and Holineſs are wrought in and upon the Soul, whereby the Soul is made in ſome meaſure like unto <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> being by the Spirit united to him, planted and grafted in him, and by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of its union with him, made partakers of his Life and Grace, whereby it lives and grows, until it come to the State of Perfection in the other World.</p>

This Spirit thus ſavingly working, is <hi>God's Seal upon our Hearts,</hi> the Seal of his <hi>everlaſting love to our Souls,</hi> and of his <hi>everlaſting Covenant</hi> which he hath entred into with us, which he will never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face or blot out; and it is alſo the <hi>Earneſt of our Inheritance;</hi> that thereby we may confidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude to our great comfort, that, as ſure as he hath given us his Spirit, thus ſavingly to work in us thoſe gracious Works, this gracious Change, this true Repentance, and Faith and Love, and Holineſs, and other Graces; even ſo ſure he will give us the Inheritance in Heaven at laſt: as ſurely as he hath ſanctified us, ſo ſurely he hath juſtified us, and will glorifie us: For this is the Seal, this is the Earneſt. And upon this account ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Having this Seal, this Earneſt, this comfortable Aſſurance of a better ſtate, and of a better life after this, we groan earneſtly to be clothed upon with our houſe which is from Heaven;</hi> That we may poſſeſs that glorious purchaſed Inheritance, of which we now have the earneſt; we long to enjoy the full Harveſt, of which we have received the Firſt-fruits, and conſequently, we that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived theſe Firſt-fruits, this bleſſed Earneſt; have no cauſe to be troubled or diſquieted, when theſe our earthly Tabernacles begin to decay and periſh; becauſe we are wrought by <hi>God's Spirit</hi> for a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtate; and, as was ſaid, not only the <hi>Spirit of God worketh this willingneſs to die,</hi> by working thoſe Graces in the Soul, as you ſee; but alſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying Afflictions, and bleſſing them, to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie our Affections to earthly things, and helps to Holineſs in order to our eternal Happineſs; and therefore alſo ought the more patiently to be endured.</p>

                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Then it is the chiefeſt wiſdom in the World, for every one of us to labour to become real Saints, to get into a ſtate of ſaving Grace; and often to ſearch and try our ſelves, and never to give over ſearching and trying, until we come to ſome well-grounded Aſſurance, That we are indeed truly Regenerated, and that we have a real Intereſt in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> for this Aſſurance may be attained, and we are commanded to give <hi>all diligence to attain it,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 10. It is not bare wiſhes or deſires will ſerve the turn, but we muſt labour and ſtrive after it, and be much in ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examination, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. How is it poſſible we can have any true comfort living or dying, if we have no Aſſurance of a better Life; and ſo long as we know not whether we ſhall go to Heaven or Hell when we die: We all have been too negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in labouring after this Aſſurance; let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it, and let us all now begin to beſtir our ſelves, and in <hi>God's</hi> ſtrength lay out our utmoſt care and pains in the uſe of all means to get the clear evidences of our peace with <hi>God,</hi> and that we are in a pardoned and reconciled ſtate; for upon this Aſſurance, we ſhall have this Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage above all others, that we ſhall not be troubled nor much diſquieted, when our outward man doth decay and periſh, our earthly comforts fail us, our bodily Members wither; becauſe all theſe decays and waſtings do but make way, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare us for the happineſs of our Souls. Whereas, on the contrary, it muſt needs be an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable thing, to look upon a decaying Body, and be altogether uncertain what will become of the Soul when it leaves this Body: It muſt needs make Death terrible. But when we know that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:34230:27"/>
our Souls at death ſhall <hi>enter into our Master's joy</hi> we ſhall bid Death welcom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Eighth Inference.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From what hath been ſaid, we may draw one Rule of Tryal to us all, whereby we may know whether we be true real <hi>Christians</hi> or no, or only nominal, and but formal Profeſſors, <hi>viz.</hi> by the real good to our Souls that our Afflictions have done us; we all have had Afflictions of one kind or other; let us examine what ſpiritual good we have got by them: look over the former Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and apply them.</p>
                  <p>It is a true ſign of a Child of <hi>God,</hi> to be the better for <hi>Proſperity</hi> and <hi>Adverſity,</hi> and commonly more the better for <hi>Adverſity</hi> than or <hi>Proſperity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But leſt we ſhould be miſtaken, I grant, that Affliction may work ſome good in the hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Profeſſors, as on <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Nineveh.</hi> But note theſe Differences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> On the <hi>Godly,</hi> Afflictions work good moſtly on their <hi>inward man,</hi> on their Souls; although they work good alſo on their Converſations; the ſweet fruits of Afflictions appear alſo in their Lives. But on others, if Afflictions do work any good at all, it is moſtly on their <hi>outward man;</hi> they may by them be outwardly reclaimed and reformed, but not inwardly renewed and ſanctified. Now there is a vaſt difference between outward Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and inward Renovation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> The fruit of Affliction on the Godly is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually increaſing and growing; it is renewing <hi>day by day;</hi> as in the Text. But the Fruit of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction upon others, is like a <hi>morning dew,</hi> or
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34230:27"/>
                     <hi>early cloud,</hi> which the Sun-blaſt of Proſperity dries all up, and blows all off. Thoſe ſeeming Fruits of Humility, of Senſibleneſs, Patience, Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to good Duties, Reſolutions againſt Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which appear in ſome in time of their Affliction, are all blaſted and withered again, when their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are removed, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Fruit of Affliction upon the Godly is more afterward than at preſent, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Nature of the Saints Troubles, they are <hi>Afflictions,</hi> and our <hi>Afflictions:</hi> All the Saints Troubles in this Life are <hi>Afflictions,</hi> and but <hi>Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;</hi> they are not properly Puniſhments, inflicted on them, to make Satisfaction for Sin.

                  </gap>, which ſignifieth a preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, from the effect of them on the Saints; for they are ſent to preſs out their hidden Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that were in the Heart undiſcovered; to make manifeſt that which lay hid before. <hi>Affliction</hi> is as God's Wine-preſs alſo, to preſs out the ſweet Wine of Grace, that it may appear in Act and Exerciſe. It is alſo God's Fullers-preſs, to preſs out the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſpots and defilements of their Souls. <hi>Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> are not to the Saints Executions of Vengeance, not Deſtructions, as they are to others, Deſtruction upon Deſtruction; that is, one Trouble and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs upon another; ſo they are to the Wicked.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are our <hi>Affliction</hi> too: this may note, firſt, the commonneſs of them to all men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13. No Temptation befals us, but what is common to Men, to all Men, and moſtly, to all Saints; it is their Lot, their Portion; yea, it is
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:34230:33"/>
God's Gift to them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 29. Secondly, It may note the Propriety the Saints have in their <hi>Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and Benefit they have by them. Theſe <hi>Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> are ours, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22. <hi>All things are yours, things preſent:</hi> the preſent <hi>Afflictions</hi> are ours; that is, they are ſanctified, and made profitable to us; they are our Friends, Friends to our Souls, not our Foes; they are our Helps, not our Harms; they are ours in common alſo; they are the Churches Troubles; others ſympathize with us, and they count our Afflictions theirs.</p>
               <p>And if this be ſo, what reaſon have we to faint and ſink under our Troubles, ſeeing they are but Afflictions, not Deſtructions, and ſeeing they are ours alſo, for our good and advantage, appointed and ordered to us by the loving Hand of our only-wiſe God and gracious Father: and ſeeing all the People of God have a ſhare in them, by way of ſympathy, and we have a ſhare in their Prayers for us, therefore we faint not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond Branch of this Argument is the Quality of thoſe Afflictions, expreſſed here by two words, 1. <hi>They are light,</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The meaning plainly is comparative; <hi>Afflictions</hi> are light, not ſimply conſidered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but by way of compariſon; as thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are <hi>light,</hi> in compariſon of what our Sins have deſerved. Sin deſerves Eternal Death, everlaſting Flames in Hell, everlaſting Deſtruction, eaſeleſs, endleſs, remedileſs Torments. The Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Sin is Death, eternal Damnation, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 8, 9. Now, in compariſon of Hell and Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all our Afflictions are but light, but as Flea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitings to thoſe eternal Torments: Oh, what is the Wrath of Man to the Wrath of a GOD? What is the Diſpleaſure of a Father to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of an Enemy? Oh, what is Sickneſs, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, a Priſon, Loſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to Hell-fire?</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are light, in compariſon of the cruel, bitter, dreadful Sufferings of Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God. He, upon whom the Spirit of Might did reſt, was even ſunk by them; if we do but duly conſider Chriſt's Sufferings, his bloody, bitter Agony in the Garden, when his Soul was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſorrowful even to death, he was ſore ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; when all the Sins of the Elect were laid on him, made to meet on him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 6. all the Wrath of Men and Devils on him, yea, and which was heavieſt of all, his Father's Wrath was on him; it pleaſed the Father to bruiſe him, and to put him to grief, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 10. All this would have ſunk Ten thouſand Worlds; this made our deareſt Lord ſweat great drops of Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable love of our Bleſſed Jeſus! O, the curſed nature of Sin! But what are all our Afflictions, all our Sufferings, in compariſon of Chriſt's? He was
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34230:34"/>
                  <hi>afflicted,</hi> he was <hi>oppreſſed,</hi> infinitely more than ever any man was, or can be.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Light</hi> too, in compariſon of what the Wicked ſhall ſuffer hereafter: ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11. 6. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 8. Our <hi>Afflictions</hi> are light, ſurely very light in compariſon of theſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Light</hi> alſo in compariſon of the Glory that <hi>God's Suffering Saints</hi> ſhall afterwards enjoy. This our Apoſtle affirms, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 18. <hi>I reckon that the ſufferings of this preſent life are not worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the glory that ſhall be revealed in vs.</hi> Not worthy to be compared with that far more excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and eternal weight of Glory. Thus are our <hi>Afflictions</hi> ſaid to be light.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Quality of our <hi>Afflictions</hi> noted here, is, That our <hi>Afflictions</hi> are ſhort alſo: as they are light, ſo they are ſhort too, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But how can this be? Did not <hi>David</hi> complain, that he was <hi>afflicted</hi> from his Youth, and the Church in <hi>Affliction</hi> four hundred years at once? How then are their <hi>Afflictions</hi> ſhort?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This <hi>for a moment,</hi> or ſhort time, muſt be underſtood comparatively alſo; Our <hi>Afflictions</hi> are ſhort, and <hi>for a moment,</hi> in compariſon of what the Damned muſt ſuffer; for their Death is eternal, their Deſtruction is everlaſting, everlaſting Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in Hell, the Fire never goeth out, the <hi>Worm never dyeth.</hi> But eſpecially, our <hi>Afflictions</hi> here are ſhort, as well as light in compariſon of that <hi>far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory,</hi> that the Saints ſhall poſſeſs hereafter.</p>
               <p>Obſerve the <hi>Antitheſis,</hi> or oppoſition here in the Text, which duly conſidered, and Faith acted on it,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34230:34"/>
is enough to ſupport a Chriſtian under all his Troubles. Mark it well.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Afflictions</hi> here, he ſhall have <hi>Glory</hi> hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for <hi>light Afflictions</hi> he ſhall have a <hi>weight of Glory;</hi> for <hi>ſhort Afflictions</hi> an <hi>eternal weight of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> yea, <hi>a far m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Let us ſeriouſly conſider how ſtrangely and wonderfully the Happineſs of Suffering Saints is here ſet out by the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is <hi>Glory,</hi> it is <hi>Glory</hi> that they ſhall receive hereafter, a <hi>Crown of Glory,</hi> that fadeth not away. It is <hi>Glory</hi> that they ſeek for, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 6, 7. and it is <hi>Glory</hi> they ſhall have. Here in this World the poor Chriſtian meets with ſhame and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, laden with Reproaches, made the off-ſcouring of all things, trodden down as Mire in the Streets, the Song of Drunkards; but hereafter they ſhall be advanced to <hi>Glory:</hi> what this <hi>Glory</hi> imports, I ſhall enquire hereafter. It is ſurely a Soul-ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, a Soul-ſatisfying thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a <hi>weight of Glory:</hi> Not a grain or ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (though a little of this <hi>Glory</hi> will abundantly recompenſe all our Sufferings in the way to it) but it is a <hi>weight of Glory,</hi> enough to fill all the Faculties of the whole Soul, enough to ſatisfie the vaſt Deſires of the Mind, which the whole Creation cannot do; yea, enough to ſink the Soul under the weight of it, did not the Almighty Power of God uphold it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is <hi>eternal</hi> alſo: The glorified Saints ſhall never be unglorified again: it is everlaſting Glory.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is <hi>an exceeding weight of Glory:</hi> ſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſurpaſſing, and tranſcending, not only our Merits, but our Deſires, our Thoughts and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34230:35"/>
                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 20. and of which it may be ſaid, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Myſteries of the Goſpel, that <hi>it never entred into the heart of man to conceive,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is a <hi>more exceeding:</hi> it is a marvellous Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; what a Climax, what a Gradation is here!</p>
               <p n="6">6. A <hi>far more exceeding:</hi> it exceeds all our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, all our Thoughts, it is more than we can ask or think; it exceeds all our Doings, all our Sufferings, more than Heaven exceeds Earth, or Light Darkneſs, or any thing we can imagine: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. This <hi>Glory</hi> is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, uper-excellent, beyond all meaſure excellent. Now, in compariſon of this excellent Glory, all our preſent Sufferings are but light and ſhort; and if ſo, is there any reaſon the Saints ſhould faint un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, but rather to bear up, and be of good courage?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Branch of this Argument is, the Influence that theſe ſhort and light <hi>Afflictions</hi> have upon this <hi>Glory,</hi> or the Reference they have unto it, or Tendency towards it; and that is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, and it is this: Thoſe <hi>Afflictions</hi> work for us this tranſcendent <hi>Glory.</hi> It is no where ſaid, that Honours, or Pleaſures, or Riches work for us this Glory, but <hi>Afflications</hi> work it; that is, the only-wiſe God, who can bring Light out of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Sweet out of Bitter, Good out of Evil; even He ſo ordereth and bleſſeth all the <hi>Afflictions</hi> of his People to them, that they become ſingularly uſeful, and influential, to work out for them this <hi>Glory:</hi> but not as the Papiſts hold, who abuſe this as they do other Scriptures, concluding hence, that the Saints Sufferings, as well as their Doings, do merit <hi>Glory;</hi> for this was not St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning, becauſe he ſpeaks to the contrary, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 18, <hi>I</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:34230:35"/>
                  <hi>reckon that the ſufferings of this preſent life are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be compared with the glory that is to be revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Glory</hi> is Chriſt's Purchace, not Man's Merit.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Afflictions</hi> work for us this Glory, by way of Preparation for it, as a way and means (though not the only and principal) which our gracious God appoints, ordereth, and ſanctifieth, to fit and prepare his People, for that <hi>far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> It was by the way of Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that our Lord, the Lord of Glory, went to his Glory, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 26. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſeeing <hi>Afflictions</hi> have ſuch a reference, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviency, and tendency to Glory, that they are made uſeful to fit and prepare us for this moſt bleſſed, moſt excellent ſtate of Happineſs and Glory, we faint not under them, but rather we are encouraged and ſtrengthned by the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their tendency to prepare us for our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happineſs.</p>
               <p>Now let us put all theſe pieces together, and they will yield us this comfortable Doctrinal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>That the light and ſhort Afflictions of the People of God here in this World, are ſingularly uſeful to work them for, and to work for them, a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory in the World to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is ſo plainly aſſerted here by the Apoſtle, I need not ſtand to prove it; all I have to do, is to demonſtrate, and ſhew, how thoſe light and ſhort <hi>Afflictions</hi> of God's People, are thus ſingular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſeful and influential to work them for, and to work for them, this <hi>far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;</hi> which, by the aſſiſtance of God, I ſhall endeavour to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:34230:36"/>
But before I begin this, it may not be amiſs to ſay a little (and I can ſay but a little, a very little, for I know very little) of this <hi>far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory:</hi> And ſhall I ſpeak before I know? Lord, open my Underſtanding, and pardon any Ignorance.</p>
               <p>By this <hi>far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,</hi> I underſtand, all that wonderful Happineſs and Bleſſedneſs, which the great and glorious God hath prepared for, and promiſed unto his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and which the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Blood and Paſſion, hath purchaſed for them, which chiefly conſiſts in their advancement and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the neareſt enjoyment of the great and glorious God, the Chiefeſt Good, to be ever with the Lord, to ſee his Face, to know him as we are known of him, to live for ever with him, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of his Glory to their everlaſting Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But, alas! how ſhort and ſhallow are my Apprehenſions of what I am writing? If it did not appear to the beloved <note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 2.</note> Diſciple, what Happineſs the Saints ſhould be advanced to, at the laſt, but only in general, that when Chriſt appears, we ſhall be like him: No marvel if ſuch a poor blind Worm as I know ſo little; yet ſome glimpſes we have in the Glaſs of the Goſpel, whereby we may come to a little dark Knowledge, and a ſlight taſte of this Glory.</p>
               <p>It is the Souls enjoyment of God, the chief Good, and that is the ſum and ſubſtance of all Happineſs and Bleſſedneſs; this is called, <hi>Seeing God, Matth.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. 15. <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 4. <hi>Beholding the glory of Chriſt, John</hi> 17. 24. <hi>Seeing God face to face;</hi> that is, as far as Creatures are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. See the Prayer of Chriſt, which doth notably expreſs this <hi>weight of Glory, Joh.</hi> 17. 21, 22, 23.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:34230:36"/>
                  <hi>That they all may be one, as thou father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us; and the glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; that the world may know that thou haſt loved them as thou haſt loved me.</hi> What can be more deſired? Here is a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory indeed; a real Union of the Saints with the Bleſſed God, and the Bleſſed Jeſus, ſuch a Union as is between the Head and the Members, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Huſband and Wife; yea, ſuch as is between God and Chriſt, and a participation of the ſame Glory that Chriſt himſelf doth poſſeſs, and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the ſame Love that Chriſt himſelf doth enjoy; yea, the Saints ſhall then be made like unto Chriſt, both in Soul and Body. <q>Lord, help me to believe all this, and to be fully perſwaded of it, that my Heart may be kindly affected, and filled with enflamed affections towards my Bleſſed Jeſus, who hath purchaſed all this Glory for us with his moſt precious Blood: Oh, let me at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the full aſſurance of my true Title thereto, that I may praiſe thee, and may long for the full poſſeſſion of it: O my baſe unbelieving Heart! Lord, ſubdue my unbelief: Oh, what pains ſhould we take to be aſſured of this Glory? and, how patiently and cheerfully ſhould we bear our Afflictions, that are deſigned to prepare us for it?</q>
               </p>
               <p>But I cannot break off here. This <hi>weight of Glory</hi> is, by the Holy Ghoſt, in the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to us, by all the moſt excellent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful things among Men, ſpeaking to our Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, and after the manner of Men. Hence it is called a <hi>Kingdom; It is your Father's good pleaſure</hi> (ſaith our Lord) <hi>to give you a Kingdom: I appoint</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:34230:37"/>
                  <hi>unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me a kingdom.</hi> The Kingdom of Heaven, a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that cannot be moved; a Kingdom of Glory; a Crown of Glory, that fadeth not away; a Crown of Righteouſneſs; a Crown of Life: Chriſt hath made us Kings and Prieſts to God. Here in this World the Saints have the Croſs, Fire, Faggot, Halters, Gibbets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> let them wait but a while, and they ſhall hear the Judge of the whole World ſay unto them, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, enter into the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world.</hi> Now you are abuſed, reproached, impriſoned, impoveriſhed, deſpiſed; ſhortly you ſhall all be crowned.</p>
               <p>This Glory is called the <hi>Inheritance of the Saints in light,</hi> an Inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, that fadeth not away, reſerved in Heaven for you: You that now may have no Houſe nor Home of your own, no certain Dwelling-place; and you that now dwell in Houſes of Clay, tottering every moment, being the Children of God, you ſhall ſhortly enter into everlaſting Habitations, and poſſeſs thoſe glorious Manſions in the Father's Houſe; you ſhall ſhortly inhabit that <hi>Houſe not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens:</hi> God hath prepared for you a City that hath Foundations of his own building and making: Hold out <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> you ſhall ſhortly be tranſlated into the Paradiſe of GOD, above the reach of Men and Devils.</p>
               <p>Moreover, (for methinks it is good to be here) when Chriſt, who is our Life, ſhall appear, we ſhall alſo appear with him in Glory; with Palms in our Hands, and Crowns on our Heads, and with everlaſting Joy and Songs of Praiſes in our Hearts and Mouths. This Glory is called Life, Everlaſting Life, Eternal Salvation, Everlaſting
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:34230:37"/>
Peace, and Everlaſting Reſt, the purchaſed Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, that which coſt the moſt precious Blood of the only Son of God to procure, ſurely it muſt be <hi>a far more exceeding weight of Glory,</hi> that coſt ſuch a price; this Glory is the Fruit of Chriſt's Blood, and of all his cruel Sufferings: Oh, that ſome Beams of it might be darted in upon my dark Heart by the Spirit, while I am writing this, to quicken and enlarge it.</p>
               <p>It is Everlaſting Reſt,—Reſt from all Sin, the greateſt burden to a gracious Soul; and from all Sufferings; from all doubts of God's love; from all ſenſe of God's Diſpleaſure; from all Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations of Satan, of the World and Fleſh; Reſt from all Perſecutions: Now they that have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Chriſt, ſhall be glorified with him; no Priſons, Baniſhments, Burnings, Hangings, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings, then; Reſt from all our ſad and ſinful Diviſions, and from all our perſonal Sufferings, Pains, Diſeaſes, Loſſes of dear Relations, ill Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; Reſt from all Vain Thoughts, from all the pain of Duty, from all our Labours.</p>
               <p>Let us a little further conſider, I. The Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to this Glory; and, II. The Properties of it, that ſo our Hearts may be the more affected with it, and the more carried out with all Love and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after him that purchaſed it for us, and with all labour and diligence to ſecure our title to it; and may alſo the better bear all our Afflictions, which prepare us for it, and lead us to it.</p>
               <p>I. Of the Preparations to this Glory; and theſe are,</p>

Alas, what Comfort ſhould we have in this life, if it were not for the Hope of Chriſt's ſecond coming?

               <p>And for our great Comfort, let us know and believe, that however we now live as Lambs amongſt Wolves, when our glorious Lord Jeſus, the Lord of Glory, and the Prince of the Kings of the Earth, <hi>the chief Shepherd ſhall appear, we ſhall receive a crown of glory, that fedeth not away,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 4.

What if we go out of the Stirs and Troubles of this World, and enter into thoſe Chambers of Duſt, and the Doors be ſhut upon us, and we hide our ſelves, as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpaſt; as ſure as we awake in the morning, after we have ſlept out the night, ſo ſure ſhall we then awake. And what if in the Grave we become loathſome Duſt, caſt out of the ſight of Men, as not fit to be endured among the Living? What if our Bones be digged up, and ſcattered about the Pits brink, and Worms conſume our Fleſh yet <hi>we know our Redeemer liveth,</hi> and we ſhall ſee him with theſe Eyes: And why ſhould we be loth to lay down theſe Bodies of Fleſh, how comely or fair ſoever

Now his Heart is open to us, and ours ſhut to him; but when his Heart is open, and our hearts open too, oh what a weight of Joy will there then be! What a paſſionate meeting was there between our new-riſen Lord and the firſt-ſinful ſilly Woman that he appears unto? How did Love ſtruggle for expreſſion? <hi>Mary!</hi> ſaith Chriſt: <hi>Maſter!</hi> ſaith <hi>Mary;</hi> and preſently ſhe claſps about his Feet, having her Heart as near his Heart, as her Hands were to his Feet.

               <p>Certainly this moſt bleſſed ſtate is not for all, not for moſt, but only for a few: <hi>Few,</hi> ſaith our Lord, <hi>ſhall be ſaved;</hi> and thoſe are the Children of God, only they are Heirs to this Glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. If Children, then Heirs, not elſe; and ſuch we are not by Nature, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 44. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2, 3, 12. But all that are the Children of <hi>God,</hi> are made ſo by Grace; they are made ſo by Faith in Chriſt. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26. <hi>We are all the children of God by faith in Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And if we are Chriſt's by Faith, then are
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:34230:44"/>
we the Heirs of the Promiſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. That is, we are Heirs of this promiſed Glory. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17, 18. Alſo we are made the Children of <hi>God</hi> by Regeneration, by the blew-birth. Full is that Text, <hi>John</hi> 1. 12, 13. <hi>As many as received him,</hi> that is Chriſt, <hi>to them gave he power to become the ſons of God, even to as many as believe in his name: which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi> So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3, 4. we are ſaid to be begotten to this Inheritance. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 17, 18. <hi>Of his own will begat he us, by the word of truth.</hi> So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. And our Lord, who is Truth it ſelf, hath aſſured us, that <hi>except a man be born again, he can never ſee the kingdom of God;</hi> that is, he ſhall never inherit this <hi>Glory.</hi> It is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for none but <hi>God</hi>'s Children, and none are his Children but true Believers in Chriſt; none but ſuch as are truly regenerate, and born again by the Word and Spirit; now all ſuch as are in Chriſt have his Spirit living and ruling in them: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>If any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, the</hi> ſame <hi>is none of his.</hi> And, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature; all old things are paſt away, and all things are become new.</hi> And ſuch as are born again, they have the Image of <hi>God</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired in them, the Divine Nature communicated to them, the Life of <hi>God</hi> planted in them, and are thereby enabled to live unto <hi>God,</hi> and to walk as his Children, in ſincere Obedience to all his Commandments, in reſemblance of their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, in moſt hearty and ſuperiative love to him, and in an holy confidence in him, and entire dependance on him, as their moſt gracious Father Almighty, in and through their moſt dear Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Theſe are the Perſons, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:34230:45"/>
theſe only, that ſhall be advanced to this <hi>exceeding weight of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, we are made the Children of God by Covenant; God, the All-ſufficient Good, of his infinite Love and Grace, condeſcends to poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and freely beſtows himſelf upon them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes their God in Chriſt, and takes them into Covenant with himſelf, and makes them his Sons and Daughters, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17, 18. communicating to them his Spirit, working in them all ſanctifying Graces, pardoning their Iniquities, giving them new Hearts, new Spirits, ſoft and tender Hearts, Hearts to tremble at his Word, to mourn for Sin, their own and others, tender of God's Honour, Hearts to love him, Hearts to fear him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and enabling them to give up their whole ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly and unreſervedly unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, taking him for their only Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and as the only way and means to bring them unto God, and to his glory, ſubmitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to his gracious government in all things, and truſting in him for Life and Salvation. Theſe are the Children of God, which ſhall certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit this <hi>far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are the People of God, that ſhall poſſeſs this glory, who are deſcribed by a famous Divine, thus:—<q>They are a part of the External<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called, who being by the Spirit of Chriſt throughly though imperfectly regenerate, are hereupon convinced, and ſenſible of that evil i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

of Chriſt for their Saviour and Lord, to bring them unto God the Chief Good, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them perfectly juſt before him, do according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enter into a cordial Covenant with him, and ſo deliver up themſelves unto him, and herein per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere unto their lives end.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Children of God, all the People of God, may be aſſured of this glory; for, <hi>Firſt,</hi> God hath ordained and prepared this glory for his People: This Kingdom is prepared before the <hi>foundation of the World, Mat.</hi> 25. God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated his Children to this glorious Inheritance, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 5, 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29, 30. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 13. God hath prepared for them a City, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Matt.</hi> 20. 23. The Saints are <hi>Veſſels of Mercy,</hi> before prepared unto glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 23. And thoſe, in time, he tranſlates out of Satan's Kingdom, into the Kingdom of his dear Son, and by his Spirit of Grace, by his Word of Grace, by his Fatherly Chaſtiſements, by his Mercies, he doth by degrees make meet and fit for this glorious <hi>Inheritance with his Saints in light, Col.</hi> 1. 12, 13. And ſurely, God's Counſel ſhall ſtand, and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees be fulfilled: <hi>Therefore bleſſed are they whoſe God is the Lord, and the people whom he hath choſen for his Inheritance,</hi> Pſal. 33. 11, 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Glory is <hi>purchaſed</hi> alſo, as was ſaid before: It is alone by the Blood of Jeſus, that we have entrance into Heaven; therefore do the Saints ſing forth his Praiſes, for that he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed them out of every Nation by his Blood, and made them Kings and Prieſts to God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 9, 10. So that either Chriſt muſt loſe the price of his Blood and Sufferings, and never ſee the Travel of his Soul, but all his pain and expectations be loſt; or elſe, for certain, there remains for the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:34230:46"/>
Saints this <hi>far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Glory is <hi>promiſed</hi> alſo: God, that cannot lye, hath promiſed Eternal Life, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 32. &amp; 22. 19. <hi>I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me a kingdom.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 34. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 7, 10, 11, 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 34. with many other places. So that if the Purpoſe and Decree of God be certain, if the Purchaſe of Chriſt be certain, if the Promiſes of the faithful God be certain, <hi>all</hi> which are moſt ſure and certain, then alſo it is moſt ſure and certain, that the Children of God <hi>ſhall</hi> moſt aſſuredly one day receive this <hi>far more exceeding and eternal weigh of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, O my Soul! how long <hi>ſhall</hi> thy fooliſh Heart deceive thee? how long <hi>wilt</hi> thou ſet thy Affections on things <hi>below,</hi> upon lying dying Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities? When wilt thou draw off, and mind thy Everlaſting Reſt in good-earneſt, and lay out thy ſelf to the utmoſt, to ſecure thy Title to it? <hi>Lord, be merciful to me, according to thy loving kindneſs: and according to the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out all my Tranſgreſſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have I ſaid a little concerning this <hi>far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,</hi> of the Preparatives to it, of the Properties of it, and of the People that <hi>ſhall certainly</hi> poſſeſs it, to their everlaſting conſolation. And what <hi>ſhall</hi> I ſay now, but that Shame ſhould cover my Face, and Sorrow fill my Heart, for that I am ſo <hi>little,</hi> oh! ſo <hi>little affected</hi> with theſe great things: Oh, what a hard earthly Heart have I! Oh, that <hi>all</hi> thoſe that <hi>ſhall</hi> read or hear what I have written, may have their Hearts more affected with theſe things, and that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:34230:46"/>
they may be perſwaded and enabled in the ſtrength of <hi>God,</hi> to put forth all their Power, in the uſe of all means, while they have time, to be aſſured on good grounds, that they are the perſons deſigned for this Glory: And, oh that you and I would now examine our Hearts and States about this.</p>
               <p>Let us in the preſence of <hi>God</hi> ask our ſelves theſe few ſerious Queſtions: Are we the Children of <hi>God,</hi> they only are Heirs to this Glory? Have we, out of a true ſenſe of our Sin and Miſery, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily accepted of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for our only Lord and Saviour, really yielded up our whole ſelves to his government? Are we truly regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, our Natures changed, <hi>God</hi>'s Image repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on us, and his Spirit living and ruling in us? Do we hold out the Life of Chriſt in our Life, and are we like <hi>God?</hi> Have we actually entred into Covenant with <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and choſen him for our only Happineſs and Portion, giving up our ſelves unfeignedly to be the Lord's? Let us deal uprightly with our ſelves, and if our Conſciences can witneſs for us, that it is thus with us, then may we be confident that all our Afflictions ſhall work and prepare us for that Glory.</p>
               <p>I proceed now to ſhew how thoſe light and ſhort Afflictions of the People of <hi>God</hi> in this World, are ſingularly uſeful and influential to work them for, and to work for them this <hi>far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> And that theſe waies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> By diſcovering, imbittering, curing, and removing thoſe things, which undiſcovered, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, and uncleanſed, would utterly deprive us of that <hi>far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> What thoſe things are, you may eaſily judge; they are our Sins, our Corruptions, our Iniquities,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:34230:47"/>
the Evils of our Hearts and Lives, the filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit; theſe not purged away, will moſt certainly exclude from <hi>Glory;</hi> as, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5, 6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 27. <hi>No unclean thing ſhall ever enter into the</hi> New Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>Now Afflictions are uſeful to diſcover Sin, to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate and imbitter Sin, to cleanſe and cure the Soul, and ſo to prepare it for Glory.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) To diſcover Sin: Afflictions enlighten mens Eyes; One calls Afflictions the <hi>Christian's Eye-bright.</hi> Man is full of <hi>Self-love,</hi> and this Love is blind and blinding; and Man's Heart is deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ignorant, his Mind is dark; Man is born blind, ſpiritually blind; Men ſee not their Sin and Miſery, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17. until God diſcover their Sins to them, which He doth, as by his Word and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſo by Afflictions, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 22. 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 17. 18. God doth by his Rod ſhew Men their Iniquities. A very <hi>Pharoah</hi> ſees, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth his Sin in his Affliction: So did the Jews, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 11. And it's uſual for men to cry out on their Sins in their Trouble, <hi>Oh then, my Pride, my Covetouſneſs, my Prophaneneſs, my Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs,</hi> &amp;c. of which they would not hear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>(<hi>2ly.)</hi> Afflictions are very uſeful to aggravate and imbitter Sin: Thoſe Sins that were ſweet in time of Proſperity, and ſeemed ſmall, or nothing but <hi>Mole-hills,</hi> as it were, light and little, prove bitter and grievous, even as heavy as Mountains. Were not <hi>David</hi>'s Sins ſo to him? See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>Our Lord Jeſus, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28, 29. maketh this ſenſe of the bitterneſs of Sin, a fit qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Souls to come to him, that in him they may find Reſt, which Reſt is the beginning at leaſt of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:34230:47"/>
that <hi>far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> When and where Sin is aggravated, and becomes bitter and burdenſome to a Soul, then and there Chriſt, Grace, and Glory becomes ſweet and amiable. Uſually in Proſperity Sin is ſweet, or at leaſt accounted ſmall: Is it not a little one? Oh, the Excuſes, Shifts, Evaſions, and Pleas that in Proſperity men ſtudy to extenuate and leſſen Sin! They feel but little weight in great Sins; the Sins of Youth, Vain-talking, Jeſting, officious Lying, neglect of Duty, worldly Talk on the Lord's day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who feels the ponderous weight of ſuch Sins in time of Proſperity? Now Afflictions ſerve to imbitter ſweet Sins, and to aggravate ſmall ſins. <hi>Job</hi> 13. 26, 27. then he remembers the Sins of his Youth, and looks on them otherwiſe than he did before. In Youth great Sins ſeem ſmall; as Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Parents, waſting time, prophaning the Lord's day, Lying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in Afflictions they lyo heavy; as we ſee in <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 22.</p>
               <p>(<hi>3ly.)</hi> To cure and cleanſe Sin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 67. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31. 18. Eminent is the Example of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes,</hi> on whom Afflictions wrought a wonderful change, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. And this comes to paſs, in that Afflictions, when <hi>God</hi> bleſſeth them, they work Repentance: This is one of God's ends in ſending Afflictions upon his People, <hi>his Children, whom he loves dearly, Dan.</hi> 11. 33, 34, 35. It is to make them white and clean, to purge away their Iniquity, <hi>Iſa,</hi> 27. 9.</p>
               <p>And thus Afflictions are influential on God's People, to work them for, and to work for the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;</hi> for none are fit for this glory until ſin be imbittered to them, and they purged and cleanſed from their
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:34230:48"/>
Sins in the Fornace of Affliction, but all through the vertue of the Blood of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 7, 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Afflictions are uſeful to prepare for <hi>Glory,</hi> by being means of God's Appointment and Bleſſing, to work gracious and happy Changes on men, without which they can never come to glory. All men muſt have mighty, great, and wonderful Changes made upon them, before they can be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified: Now, to effect theſe gracious Changes, God uſeth various means, as principally his Spirit, his Word, his Rod; and many times he makes his Rod to do that, and to work that great Change on Men, which his Spirit and Word, without the Rod, could not do, becauſe of Mens reſiſtance of the Spirit and Word; but when the Rod comes, they cannot reſiſt that. By the Rod he makes the Proud to ſtoop and become humble, as in <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Rod and the Word work Wonders, when God by his Spirit works in them and with them. Afflictions change, even ſuch as were Beaſts, into Men, yea, into Saints: <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 18. <hi>I was</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ephraim) as a Bullock, a Beaſt, before I was chaſtized; but being chaſtized, I ſpake like a man, yea, like a child of God.</hi> Afflictions working effectually, work this Change. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 67. ſo on <hi>Manaſſes;</hi> many a Child of God can witneſs this Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Afflictions both drive and draw God's People nearer to him; they wandered before, they went a whoring from God after other Lovers; but Afflictions bring them home, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142. 4, 5. As the natural Spirits in the Body retire inward, and get cloſe to the Heart in cold weather, and in any danger outward; ſo the Souls of God's People draw
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:34230:48"/>
neareſt to <hi>God</hi> in times of Storms and Tempeſts in the World: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. from <hi>ver.</hi> 9, to 16. his Troubles made him take Sanctuary in God, and to truſt in him: <hi>I truſted in the Lord; I ſaid, Thou art my God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Afflictions deſtroy that great Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that unfits for Glory, and that is Earthly-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedneſs, inordinate Love of the Creature, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 19. Earthly-mindedneſs fits for Deſtruction, and not for Salvation: Afflictions are intended to wean our Hearts from the World, to crucifie our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to Earthly things: And this effect they had on our Apoſtle here, and upon the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as Verſe the laſt; <hi>We look not</hi> (ſay they) <hi>on thoſe things which are ſeen, for they are temporal: All Creature-enjoyments, which Worldlings ſet their Hearts upon, and labour ſo eagerly after, we value them not, we care not much for them, our Hearts are weaned from them, we are crucified to the World, and the World is crucified to us; but we look to thoſe things which are not ſeen; we mind, and think on, and hope, and believe, and joy in thoſe things which are not ſeen; our Hearts are in Heaven, ſet upon the unſeen God, the unſeen Glory there, the unſeen Jeſus.</hi> And whence came they to be wrought into this bleſſed heavenly frame, but much by the Bleſſing of God on their Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, God's Spirit working in and with their Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions this deadneſs of Affection to the World, and raiſing up their Hearts towards Heaven? So their Afflictions were uſeful to them, to prepare them for Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> By working in us; and exerciſing in us thoſe Graces to which Glory is promiſed: <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3, 5. <hi>Tribulation worketh Patience, and Patience Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:34230:49"/>
                  <hi>and Experience Hope:</hi> Yea, God's Spirit makes Afflictions uſeful to work Holineſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 10. to make God's Children partakers of his Holineſs, <hi>without which no man ſhall ſee God. So Jam.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Happy is the man that endureth temptation, for when he is tryed, he ſhall receive a crown of glory, which God hath promiſed to them that love him.</hi> And in hope of this glory God's People rejoyce in their Tribulations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Afflictions quicken God's People to all diligence and ſeriouſneſs in the uſe of all God's means to obtain Glory; they quicken to Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examination: <hi>I conſidered my ways,</hi> ſaith <hi>David:</hi> They make them ſearch their Hearts, and try their ways: Afflictions make them put away their Idols, helping on the work of Reformation, quicken them to Prayer; then they cry unto the Lord, and pour out their Hearts before him, and God loves to hear their Cries; then they wreſtle with God in Prayer, and then they are ſerious in their Reproofs, Admonitions, and Inſtructions of others; then alſo they labour to act their Faith and their Love to God and Chriſt, and to <hi>ſet their Affection upon things above,</hi> and to look to their Sincerity and Uprightneſs. Unto all thoſe things we are too backward in time of Proſperity, but in trouble we are awakened and quickened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Afflictions prepare God's People for glory, by working in them ſtrong Deſires, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Pantings and Breathings after that <hi>far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> When holy <hi>David</hi> was in a barren Wilderneſs, where no Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Earthly Comforts were to be had, oh! then his Soul, and Fleſh, and all, did thirſt after God.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34230:49"/>
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 1, 2, 3, 8. then his Soul followed hard after God. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 1, 2, 3, 4. in Proſperity our Souls follow too hard after the Creature, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the lying, dying vanities of this World: Oh, how are we enamoured with theſe fading Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Braveries! How eagerly do we purſue the Profits and Pleaſures of the World! we may with Shame and Sorrow confeſs it; but when our Heavenly Father ſtrips us of all our pleaſant things, plucks our faireſt Flowers out of our Hands, and ſnatches our deareſt Comforts out of our Boſoms, oh, then what Breathings and Pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings after God, the light of his Countenance, and the manifeſtations of his Love! When Earth is gone, then Heaven is welcome; when the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is gone, then Chriſt is ſweet.</p>
               <p>Before I come to the Application, three Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions ſhall be reſolved.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Q. 1. <hi>How muſt Afflictions be ſo born, as that they may thus work?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>How muſt they be improved to attain this end?</hi>

               </list>
               <p>Q. 1. <hi>How must Afflictions be born, that they may work thus, to prepare us for that far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory?</hi> Of all theſe Queſtions I have treated on other Texts, which may be ſeen in my Notes. Yet briefly,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That our Afflictions may thus work, we muſt be ſure to bear them as Chriſtians; our Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and Deportment in them, and under them, muſt be as becometh Chriſtians, that is, in ſuch a Chriſtian manner as Chriſt did bear his Sufferings. We muſt ſet Chriſt before us for our Example, to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:34230:50"/>
imitate him; and we muſt ſet the Saints of God before us for our Example alſo, and bear our Afflictions as they bore theirs: And alſo, we muſt bear them according to the Rules of Chriſtianity ſet down in the Goſpel; and that is, we muſt bear our Afflictions quietly, ſilently, patiently, ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, contentedly, willingly, cheerfully, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly: So did our Lord Jeſus, and ſo did the Saints; and ſo muſt we, if we will have this great benefit by them, that they may prepare us for Glory?</p>
               <p>Q. 2. <hi>How muſt we improve them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> By the conſcientious practice of theſe Duties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Serious Conſideration. In the day of Adverſity conſider; <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 14. Do we ſuffer? Let us conſider for whom, for what, from whom we ſuffer? Conſider, what our Lord hath ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for us, what our Sins have deſerved, and what our ſpecial Duties are in time of Afflictions: Let us fill up our Thoughts with theſe ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and dwell ſome time in the Meditations of them, and let them ſink into our Minds, and it will much help us in the ſpiritual improvement of our Afflictions for our great advantage.</p>
               <p>The want of this due conſideration God char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth on the Jews as a very great Sin, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>I have ſmitten them, but they have not grieved,</hi> &amp;c. God expects, that when he ſmites us, we ſhould lay it to Heart, ponder upon it, and conſider it, or elſe know this, that there is a more dreadful ſtroke of hardneſs upon thy Heart, than there is upon thy out-comforts; for then, without this due Conſideration, no Duty is performed, nor
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:34230:50"/>
Benefit received by all our Afflictions.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) In time of Affliction conſider the vanity of the Creature. When God deprives us of our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Comforts, takes away our deareſt Relations, now conſider what vain things they are, that we promiſe our ſelves ſo much Comfort and Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in; how ſoon they wither, one ſtroke from God ſeparates us and them, they are gone. We can talk of the Vanity of the Creature, but it is never ſo well learned, as when God teacheth by our own Experience; other mens Experience is not ſo much to us. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 6, 7. <hi>All fleſh is graſs;</hi> all Creature-enjoyments are withering graſs.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Conſider the Evil of Sin: Are we in any Affliction, are we in Pain, under any Trouble? Let us now conſider what Sin is, which is the cauſe of all thoſe Miſeries. Theſe are the bitter Fruits of Sin.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Conſider alſo the End and Deſign of God in our Afflictions. Shew me wherefore thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeſt with me. What Provocation have we gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven God? What have we done?</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) What Errand and Meſſage is this Affliction come upon? Surely God hath ſent it upon ſome Errand; what is his meaning?</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) Conſider alſo the merciful and gracious Diſpoſition of God towards his People in Affliction, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 19. He is grieved for them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 9. In all their Afflictions he is afflicted, he doth not afflict willingly, he loves them when he corrects them.</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) Conſider God's fatherly Affection to his Children in Affliction; <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 33. <hi>Judg.</hi> 10. 16. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 20. <hi>My bowels are turned for him.

               <p n="7">(7.) Conſider God's gracious moderation of his Peoples Afflictions. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 7, 8. He afflicts in meaſure, <hi>He ſtayeth his rough wind in the day of the eaſt wind:</hi> He doth not puniſh as we deſerve, <hi>Job</hi> 34. 23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 10. <hi>Job</hi> 11. 6. (2.) He will keep us from ſinking, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 22. <hi>2Cor.</hi> 4. 8, 9, 10. Though<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

No: but he would put ſtrength in me.</hi> Pſal. 37. 24. <hi>The Lord upholdeth with his hand.</hi> (3.)

He hath delivered, he doth deliver, and will deliver. Pſal. 126. 5. <hi>They that ſow in tears, ſhall reap in joy.</hi> (4.) He orders all the Circumſtances of our Troubles; the Time how long; the Place where; the Quality, what kind; the Meaſure, how much. All the Powers of Men and Devils are not able to add a dram to the weight, nor a drop to the meaſure, of what our gracious Father hath appointed for us.</p>
               <p>All theſe ſeven Conſiderations will exceedingly help us to make a profitable improvement of our Afflictions, for the preparing of us for that <hi>far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> And alſo theſe Conſiderations will very much help us to carry and behave our ſelves aright, and as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:34230:51"/>
under afflictive Providences, which is the right way to attain the benefit of them.</p>
               <p>It is an hard thing for a man to carry himſelf well under a ſmiling Providence: but an harder thing for a man to carry himſelf well under a ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Providence; which was hinted before.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> But a little more to ſhew how we ought to carry our ſelves under Afflictions, that ſo we may receive the Bleſſings and Benefits of them, which we may loſe by our Miſcarriages.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When any <hi>Affliction</hi> befals you, <hi>Be ſilent before the Lord, for he hath put you to ſilence.</hi> Do not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, quarrel, fret, or be diſcontented: I believe, a better ſign of an honeſt and upright Heart can ſcarcely be found, than for a man to love God the more for his afflicting of him, and to cleave the faſter to God, when God cuts off his earthly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts from him: <hi>Oh, be ſilent before the Lord; Zech.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 28.</p>

his Children: And the Command of our Lord Chriſt is expreſs alſo, <hi>John</hi> 14. 1. <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled:</hi> Whatever <hi>affliction</hi> befals you, let not your Hearts be troubled. Let us urge theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands upon our ſelves: Conſider we, 1. Is there any cauſe of Heart-trouble, when our Heavenly Father, the great Lord of Heaven and Earth, hath his will, which we daily pray for? All our Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are by the Will of God. 2. When the great Proprietor and Owner of all things doth moſt wiſely and moſt righteouſly diſpoſe of his own? 3. When we are called to render back but what we had borrowed? Our Health, Eſtates, Liberty, Relations, Life it ſelf, all were but lent us. 4. When leſſer Mercies are removed, that greater and better may be beſtowed? 5. When we have our Iniquities purged, which is the ſure Evidence that they are pardoned; and that we are made more conformable to Chriſt, and ſo ſitted for nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and fuller Communion with <hi>God?</hi> 6. When our <hi>Graces</hi> are tryed and acted, and ſo made more apparent and illuſtrious? 7. When by all our <hi>Afflictions</hi> we are prepared for that <hi>far more excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and eternal weight of glory?</hi> Let us weigh all theſe things well, and they will help us againſt Wearineſs: And for our further help againſt Heart-trouble, ſee my Diſcourſe on <hi>John</hi> 14. 1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That we may not grow weary of <hi>God</hi>'s Chaſtiſements, let us urge Reaſon alſo upon our ſelves, as thus: If I grow weary, I break the expreſs Command of my Heavenly Father, and diſobey the Counſel of my Dear Lord: 2. If I grow weary, it argues my Unbelief; for, who would grow weary of long and grievous <hi>Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> that did fully believe the gracious ends and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:34230:58"/>
deſigns of <hi>God</hi> in them; and his ſweet Promiſes to his <hi>afflicted People;</hi> and that <hi>Afflictions</hi> are in the Covenant; that they are the Fruits of <hi>God's</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Love, and ſhall ſurely work for our good; that the Croſs is the way to the Crown: Who believes theſe things, and yet is weary?</p>
                  <p>Again: By Wearineſs we make our Burthens heavier than <hi>God</hi> intends them to be; Cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Patience makes them lighter: The like <hi>Affliction</hi> to a patient, humble, contented Chriſtian is much lighter than to another fretful, weary, and diſcontented perſon.</p>
                  <p>Now, it is poſſible we may make our Burthens heavier than <hi>God</hi> intends them, thus: <hi>1ſt,</hi> When we think no Trouble like ours: Conſider <hi>Job</hi>'s Caſe; Trouble was upon all his Relations, all his Eſtate, upon his Body, Soul, and All. <hi>2ly,</hi> When we let looſe our Paſſions, to run whither they will, without any reſtraint: <hi>3ly,</hi> When we refuſe the Comforts that <hi>God</hi> ſends us: So did good <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, Gen.</hi> 37. 35. <hi>4ly,</hi> When we continually fix our Thoughts on our <hi>Afflictions,</hi> and are always poring on them, ſo that all the Mercies that we enjoy are quite ſwallowed up: And have we any reaſon to greaten our own Burthens? And again, by our Wearineſs we diſhonour <hi>God,</hi> and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort our ſelves, and diſcourage others.</p>

                  <p n="12">(12.) Think much on the ſhortneſs and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Life; Life is not <hi>vita,</hi> but <hi>via ad vitam:</hi> Hold out <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> thy Troubles and thy Life will ſhortly end together.</p>

                  <q>While we look not at thoſe things which are ſeen, but at thoſe things which are not ſeen: for thoſe things which are ſeen are temporal, but thoſe things which are not ſeen are eternal.</q>

               <p>WE have ſeen in the former Diſcourſe how bravely the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> and <hi>Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> bore up under all their cruel Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and got advantage by them; as <hi>Ver.</hi> 16, 17. and what means they uſed to attain this holy Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:34230:64"/>
beſides all which, here is another ſingular Help they made uſe of, to get this gracious frame of Spirit, and that is in theſe words, Verſe 18. <hi>We faint not</hi> (they ſay) <hi>but gather ſtrength, and get ground inwardly; while we look not at thoſe things which are ſeen, but at thoſe things which are not ſeen:</hi> So long as we ſhut out viſible things of our Minds, and ſhut our Eyes at them, and ſo long as we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and mind things inviſible, and fix our Eyes on unſeen things; while we do ſo, we faint not under all our Sufferings, but profit by them. Here is looking off, and looking on, a double Act of Faith; a looking off <hi>ſeen things,</hi> things viſible to the Eye of Sence, we look off theſe; and a looking on <hi>things not ſeen,</hi> but inviſible to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Eye.</p>
               <p>Here is a double work, one negative, the other affirmative: For the negative part, obſerve, 1. the Act, if I may properly ſo call it, a looking off; or a looking away from, a withdrawing of their ſight. 2. An Object, things that are ſeen, viſible things, things obvious to bodily right. 3. The Reaſon annexed, for they are are <hi>temporal:</hi> All things that are ſeen are <hi>temporal,</hi> things that will laſt but for a time, a ſhort time; they are fading, fleeting things, tranſitory momentany things: Be they good things or evil things, be they proſperous or adverſe, be they ſweet or bitter things, if they be ſeen things, viſible things, they are but <hi>temporal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. A poſitive practice, but we look unto <hi>thoſe things which are not ſeen.1ſt,</hi> Here is the Act, <hi>we look; Actus Animae,</hi> it is the Act of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Will, and Affections, all are ſet and fixed on, and employed about. <hi>2dly,</hi> The Object, <hi>things that are not ſeen,</hi> things inviſible; and the Reaſon is added, for they <hi>are eternal:</hi> And becauſe theſe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:34230:65"/>
unſeen things are eternal, therefore are they moſt worthy of our moſt ſerious thoughts and beſt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. And both theſe Acts, of looking off from viſible temporal things, and looking on upon invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible eternal things, have a very great influence in ſupporting Chriſtians under all their Sufferings in this World; as will manifeſtly appear in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> What is here negatively expreſſed: We look not at theſe things which are ſeen; the meaning is not, that they did ſhut their Eyes upon all earthly things, and take no notice at all of them, for that was not their Duty: The Apoſtle-himſelf laboured with his Hands, and exhorteth all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to be <hi>diligent in their Callings,</hi> which they could not be, if they did not look upon the things of this World; but he means this, that their hearts, minds, and affections were weaned and taken of from earthly things; they were not earthly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>They minded not the things of the fleſh, Rom.</hi> 8. 5, 6. that is, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

So here, we look not on things that are ſeen, that is, we place not our Affections on them; viſible
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:34230:65"/>
things are not the chief and principal things that we mind; nor do we exerciſe and ſpend our moſt ſerious and chief thoughts about theſe viſible things, they are not the main ſtudy and care of our Souls. <hi>I am</hi> (ſaith this Apoſtle) <hi>crucified to the world, and the world is crucified to me, Gal.</hi> 6. 14.</p>
               <p>There are two kinds of viſible things, viſible good things, and viſible evil things, neither of which was the object of their principal thoughts and cares; and they give a good Reaſon for it, becauſe they are temporal, they are ſhort-liv'd, and but for the preſent, and therefore we do not much mind them, nor look after them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Viſible good things, ſimply and in themſelves good; as,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Life, Animal Life, one of the beſt good things in the World, yet very ſhort, and very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, <hi>Job</hi> 14. 1. <hi>James</hi> 4. 14. What is our life? It is but a Vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vaniſheth away; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 4, 5.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The Accommodations of Life, as, Riches, but <hi>uncertain,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. <hi>Corruptible,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17, 18. <hi>Deceitful, Matth.</hi> 13. 22.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Pleaſures, <hi>they are but for a ſeaſon, Heb.</hi> 11. all lawful Pleaſures, ſuch as <hi>Solomon</hi> had, all but <hi>vanity and vexation;</hi> Health and Strength, Friends and Relations, all are but for a time, a very ſhort uncertain time. <hi>Abraham</hi> had his <hi>Sarah,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> his <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> his <hi>Rachel,</hi> but for a time; daily Experience proves all this, all viſible good is but temporal.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Evil things that are viſible are but temporal alſo. Heavineſs endureth but for a moment; Sickneſs, Pain, Poverty, Diſgrace, Perſecution, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are but <hi>for a moment,</hi> Tribulation ten days, an hour of Temptation; Deſertion but a little
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:34230:66"/>
moment; and becauſe this is the Nature and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of all viſible things, that they are tranſitory temporal things, not laſting, much leſs everlaſting; therefore we that are enlightned by Grace, and that have true underſtandings and right apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of theſe things, and which have alſo had the experience of their ſhortneſs and uncertainty, both of the good and evil things of this World, we do not look unto them, that is, we look beyond them and above them; thoſe viſible temporal things do not lye ſo near our Hearts, nor take up ſo much room in our Minds, nor ſo much place in our Affections, as inviſible eternal things do, nor as thoſe viſible temporal things do in the Hearts and Minds of others, whoſe Hope and Portion is in this Life, and whoſe Minds the <hi>God</hi> of this World hath blinded. No, no; we look not upon thoſe earthly things with ſuch an Eye of Love, Deſire, and Delight; the viſible good things of this World do not raiſe or delight our Souls, nor ſeek we that content in them that others do; nor have we ſuch dreadful thoughts of the evil things of this World, as to perplex our ſelves with the fears of them before they come; nor with immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ſorrow and grief when they come; nor are we ſo dejected and troubled, when we part with the viſible Comforts of this Life, becauſe we have right Apprehenſions of them; and therefore we faint not under our Afflictions.</p>
               <p>From hence two Points of Doctrine are obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable.</p>
               <p>1 Doct. <hi>That becauſe all viſible things are Temporal, and of no long continuance, therefore gracious Souls engage not their Hearts too much in them, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern themſelves too much for them or about them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:34230:66"/>
2 Doct. <hi>That a right and true Judgment of earthly things, will help much to ſupport and uphold the Lord's Servants in and under all the Afflictions of this Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1 <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That becauſe all viſible things are temporal, but for a ſhort time, therefore they muſt not be much minded nor regarded. This is the Character and the Duty of all gracious Souls, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 29, 30. Becauſe <hi>the time is ſhort,</hi> therefore <hi>they that have wives muſt be as if they had none, and they that weep as if they wept not, &amp;c.

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not ſo neither; for we are commanded to work, and uſe lawful Callings, and to abide in our Callings; but the meaning is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we muſt not mind and regard viſible things, earthly things <hi>Then,</hi> when we are to mind inviſible and heavenly things; ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 13.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor muſt we mind theſe viſible temporal things firſtly, principally, and chiefly, but only ſecondarily, and in ſubſerviency to heavenly things <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 33, 34. <hi>Firſt ſeek the kingdom of God;</hi> firſt, in the beginning of your Life; firſt, in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the day; firſt, in your Affections.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nor moſtly: <hi>God</hi> is to be loved <hi>with all our hearts, with all our ſouls, with all our minds, and with all our ſtrength,</hi> Matth. 22. 37. Pſal. 16. 8. <hi>I have ſet the Lord always before me, as the moſt worthy object of my continual love, deſire, fear, and delight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Nor muſt we ſo mind viſible things at all, as to be taken off from minding heavenly things, or to be hindred from, or to be unficted for minding heavenly things.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Nor muſt we mind them, but with heavenly Hearts, and for heavenly ends, ſtill minding God in them, how to glorifie him by them. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. <hi>Whether ye eat or drink, or whatever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But when do we mind viſible temporal things us much?</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:34230:67"/>
                  <hi>Anſ.1st,</hi> When we mind them unſeaſonably, as noted before: <hi>2dly,</hi> When we mind them inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, out of order, that is, firſtly and principally: <hi>3dly,</hi> When we mind them immoderately. <hi>Let your moderation be known unto all men,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But when do we mind them immoderately?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. When our minding of theſe viſible tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things hinders us from minding thoſe inviſible and eternal things. This was the Sin of <hi>Demas,</hi> his embracing this World made him forſake <hi>Paul:</hi> So that when the Service of Chriſt muſt give place to the Service of the World; when the Farm, the Oxen, the Wife, muſt be preferred before the Feaſt, and good Duties laid aſide while the World is ſerved; when the call of <hi>God</hi> is neglected, and the call of the World obeyed; then do we mind Earthly things immoderately.</p>
               <p>In ſome caſes, I confeſs, that is in Caſes of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, to ſhew Mercy to any in Miſery, to ſave or preſerve Life, God will have mercy, and not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; but out of thoſe caſes <hi>God</hi> and his Service muſt be preferred before all viſible temporal things. But when earthly things ſo fill up our Heads, Hearts, Minds, Thoughts, Hands, Time and all, that we have none left to ſpend or beſtow on hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, then we mind viſible things immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When our minding viſible temporal things unfits and indiſpoſeth us for minding inviſible and eternal things; when earthly things have ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred our Hearts, and ſo engaged our Minds, that they deaden and dull, clog and cloy our Spirits,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:34230:68"/>
ſo entangle and perplex our Thoughts, as that thereby we are put out of frame and temper, and made unfit to mind or meddle with Divine and Heavenly things. <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 34. <hi>Take heed, leſt at any time your hearts be over-charged with ſurfeiting und drunkenneſs, and cares of this life,</hi> ſaith our Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When we are leſs tired and wearied in the thoughts of viſible temporal things, than in the thoughts of inviſible eternal things: When we can plot, ſtudy, cark, care, think, muſe, ponder upon, freely talk of earthly things, without wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs, but with much delight, as being very ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to our Minds, and therefore very pleaſing and grateful to us; we can think and ſpeak of earthly things from morning till night, without wearineſs, but are ſoon weary of the ſtudy and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of heavenly things; nay, are meer Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to heavenly Meditation and heavenly Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 13. When we are in company where there is heavenly talk, we are ſoon weary of ſuch company, and of ſuch talk, and are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to break off ſuch Diſcourſe, and to entertain the talk of worldly things.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When we are more attentive unto, more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon, more ſeriouſly affected with, and more ſtrongly impreſſed by thoſe viſible temporal things, than we are with and by inviſible and eternal things. When good News from Sea or Land, a good bargain, good ſucceſs in our Worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, doth more heartily affect us and rejoyce us, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> good News from Heaven, or any ſpiritual Mercy, then we do immoderately mind earthly things. It was far otherwiſe with holy David, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 6, 7. <hi>Many ſay, Who will ſhow us any good?</hi> any viſible temporal good; but, <hi>Lord, lift thou vp</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:34230:68"/>
                  <hi>the light of thy countenance upon us: Thou haſt put more gladneſs into my heart, than when their corn and wine encreaſed.</hi> And ſo it is with all gracious Souls.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When the gain of viſible temporal things brings more joy, and the loſs of them breeds more ſorrow than the gain or loſs of inviſible eternal things; when the gain of an Eſtate, of Honour, of the Favour of a great perſon, doth more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice the Heart than the gain of the Pearl of Price; and the loſs of an Eſtate or Friend doth more caſt down than the loſs of God, or a good Conſcience.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When we are more afraid of Suffering than of Sin, and would rather venture the loſs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible eternal things, than the loſs of viſible tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things: Surely it was not thus with the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians; they looked not on thoſe viſible temporal things, they did not mind them unſeaſonably, inordinaiely, immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately; and ſo, comparatively, they are ſaid to mind them not at all.</p>

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:34230:69"/>
                  <hi>God;</hi> nothing is ſo dangerous: See <hi>Nahum</hi> 1. 2. <hi>God is jealous, and the Lord revengeth: the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeth and is furious; the Lord will take vengeance on his adverſaries, and reſerveth wrath for his enemies.</hi> What a dreadful Text is this! And who are the Lord's Enemies? Why, <hi>thoſe that are the friends of the world,</hi> ſaith the Spirit of God. Although but few think or believe ſo, yet ſo it is; and it is a moſt dreadful thing to be the Enemies of God, for then God is our Enemy, and that is moſt dreadful. Now, <hi>he that is a friend to the world, is the enemy of God. World</hi> in that place, I take to be the ſame that is here in my Text, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Viſible temporal things,</hi> the good things of this World: <hi>Such as are the friends of theſe things,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>are the enemies of God;</hi> and this is no ſmall matter: let us all therefore look well to it, that we be not ſuch.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But who are the friends of this World?</hi> you will ask.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Firſt,</hi> All ſuch as love this World, and the things of it, more than God, and Chriſt, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things; this is moſt clear: So <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 37. <hi>He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me,</hi> ſaith our Lord. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>Lovers of pleaſures more than lovers of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What do moſt People mind moſt, and think moſt upon, and ſpeak moſt of? Is it not the World, <hi>things that are ſeen?</hi> What is moſt in their Thoughts, Mornings ſoon, and Evenings late? Where are their Hearts and Affections moſt? Let our Conſciences ſpeak: Whom do we ſerve moſt, follow and purſue moſt, God or the World, Chriſt or the Creature? Who hath the precedency and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:34230:69"/>
ſupremacy in our Hearts? What Intereſt is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt in our Souls? This is a plain Rule of Tryal; and if we will ſuffer our own Conſciences to ſpeak plainly, and tell us the truth, we may know whether we be Friends of the World or no. Let us deal faithfully with our ſelves in this great Caſe, and not flatter and deceive our ſelves, as moſt do, and ſo miſtake our ſelves, by taking our ſelves to be the Lord's Servants, when indeed we are his real Enemies, becauſe we are Friends of the World; and by this miſtake may we ruine our ſelves for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> All ſuch as covet, deſire, ſeek after the World, the Profits, and Pleaſures, and Favours of it, more than after God and Chriſt, after Grace and Glory: Such as pant after the Duſt of the Earth, that make haſte to be rich, that load them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with yellow Clay, ſuch are Friends of the World: Whereas gracious Souls are like thoſe in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 8. <hi>Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O Lord, have we waited for thee: the deſire of our ſoul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee. With my ſoul have I deſired thee in the night; yea, with my ſpirit within me will I ſeek thee early.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 25, 26. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I deſire beſides thee. God is the ſtrength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 1, 2. <hi>As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, ſo panteth my ſoul after thee, O Lord.</hi> The ſtrongeſt, ſteddieſt Streams of his Deſires and Loves did run after <hi>God</hi> and his Favour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He that is commanded by the World, is a Friend of the World; one Friend can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand another; ſo all Friends profeſs to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and if they mean not ſo, they baſely diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Can the Profits and Pleaſures of the World
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:34230:70"/>
command your Hearts, Thoughts, Affections, Time and Strength, yea, and your Conſciences too? Can the World keep you from ſerving God? Can you diſpenſe with the Service of God to attend the World? then ſure you are the Friends of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Are you more intimate, friendly, and familiar, more pleaſant and joyful in the company of the People of the World? And in your dealings with the things of the World, are you more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted and pleaſed, and are, as it were, more in your Element, and where you would be, than when you are in the company of the Saints, and than when you are dealing with <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>heavenly things? David,</hi> who delighted great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in God, and in his Word, and in his Saints, profeſſed himſelf to be a Stranger in the Earth; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 19. When the Lord's Servants are in his work, and among his People, then they are in their Element, then they are where they would be: <hi>One day in thy Houſe is better than a thouſand, Pſal.</hi> 84.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> He that ſeeks the Worlds Favours, and fears the Worlds Frowns more than <hi>God</hi>'s, is a Friend of the World. A gracious Soul ſeeks no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as <hi>God</hi>'s Favour: O, how doth <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> pant after God's Favour, and the light of his Countenance! <hi>In thy favour</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is life,</hi> Pſal. 30. 6. <hi>and thy loving-kindneſs better than life,</hi> Pſal. 63. 3. And how earneſtly and frequently doth he pray, that <hi>God</hi> would not hide his Face from him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> He that is troubled more for the loſs of thoſe viſible temporal things, than for the loſs of God, or his Goſpel; and complains more for the want and abſence of theſe things, than for the want and abſence of God, ſuch, in ſuch a degree,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:34230:70"/>
are Friends of the World, and being Friends of the World, are Enemies of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> He that gives the <hi>World</hi> moſt Reſpect and beſt Entertainment: we give our Friends moſt reſpect, and beſt entertainment. How oft hath Chriſt knock'd at our Doors in the Miniſtry of the <hi>Word,</hi> and Motions of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> begging our acceptance? How oft hath Chriſt called to us in Ordinances and Providences for entertainment, and we have ſhut our Hearts againſt him? How oft hath the Holy Spirit been ſtriving with us, but we have grieved and quenched him by our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance? But how eaſily have we entertained the Enticements of the <hi>World?</hi> How readily have we embraced the Motions of the <hi>World?</hi> This proves us to be Friends of the <hi>World;</hi> and ſuch are the Enemies of God. By theſe things let us try our ſelves, and we may know whether we be the Friends of the <hi>World,</hi> or the Friends of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. This Point is proved by <hi>Example:</hi> Take our Apoſtle as a pregnant Inſtance; as in the Text, ſaying, <hi>We look not at thoſe things which are ſeen:</hi> So in <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. &amp; 6. 14. <hi>I am crucified to the world, and the world is crucified to me.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <q>I am in the Eye of the <hi>World</hi> as contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prible, deſpicable, and abominable a thing, as one hanged on the Croſs, as a Malefactor on the Gallows, an Object that Paſſengers care not to look upon, but turn away their ſight from:</q> 
                  <hi>Such a one am I,</hi> ſaith this bleſſed Apoſtle; for the <hi>World</hi> ſaid of him, Away with ſuch a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>llow, he is not worthy to live: <hi>And the world is crucified to me,</hi> ſaith he. <q>I have a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ow and baſe thoughts of the <hi>World</hi> as the <hi>World</hi> hath of me; the <hi>World</hi> is as deſpicable and contemptible to me, as I am to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:34230:71"/>
it; I look no more upon the <hi>World</hi> than it doth upon me; I do as little value the <hi>World</hi> as it doth value me.</q> And this is a full explication of his ſence in the Text, <hi>We look not on thoſe things which are ſeen, for they are temporal.</hi> This is the Character of truly-gracious Souls. So <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 24. <hi>They that are Chriſt's, have crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But how ſhall we know when we are crucified to the World?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1: When our care for viſible temporal things doth not conſume and eat out our care for inviſible and eternal things; when our care for our Bodies doth not deſtroy our care for our Souls; <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>Only take heed, and keep thy ſoul diligently:</hi> Our Souls muſt have our greateſt care, and all other cares we muſt caſt on God: <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 33. <hi>Firſt ſeek the kingdom of God, and his righteouſneſs, and all other things ſhall be added.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. When the work of the World is neglected, that the work of <hi>God</hi> may be attended. See this in <hi>Martha</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 40, 41. one thing is needful.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When, altho' our Hands may be full of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible temporal things, yet our Hearts are not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled nor over-charged with them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 34. When our Engagements about viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble temporal things do not hinder us from minding our concernments about inviſible eternal things, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 19. When matters and buſineſſes of the World are made to ſtand by, and give place to the Service of <hi>God.</hi> When praying times, hearing, reading, meditating times are duly attended and obſerved. And indeed, we have need work while
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:34230:71"/>
our day laſteth; for there is no work, wiſdom, or device in the Grave, whither we are going: All that is to be done for Eternity, muſt be done in this world, <hi>John</hi> 9. 4.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A man is then crucified to the world, and to theſe viſible things, when he is content to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe good things of the world, when the will of the Lord is ſo; Content to be without Friends, Health, Liberty, Wealth, Honours, Pleaſures, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 11, 12. Contentment is the Hearts Eaſe; well-pleaſedneſs with our condition, without vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or diſtraction; to acquieſce in the holy will of God: Godlineſs and Contentment grow both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; if Contentment be little, Godlineſs is not much: if thou be truly godly, then <hi>God,</hi> the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient and Chief Good, is thy Portion; and ſo thou haſt enough to content thee, enough to make thee happy for ever. It is a Paradox to the <hi>World,</hi> That a gracious Soul cannot be content with the whole world only, and yet can be content without it. Let us ſeek Content where we will out of <hi>God,</hi> and we ſhall never find it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And laſtly, when a man can patiently bear the loſs of all viſible temporal things, then he is crucified to the world; when Loſſes and Croſſes do not ſink him, and make him faint, as thoſe Saints in this Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. and thoſe in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 34. who took joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods. And thus we have the deſcription of a perſon that is crucified to the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>World</hi> to him; one that looks not on the things which are ſeen, that ſets not his Heart and Affections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:34230:72"/>
III. The Reaſons of the Point, why gracious Souls do not ſo much regard and mind viſible things are thoſe that follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. One Reaſon is in the Text, which is, becauſe they are temporal, fading, periſhing, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory, momentany things; <hi>All fleſh is graſs, and the glory thereof as the flower of the field:</hi> All are dying things, and therefore no ſuitable Objects for never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying Souls to ſpend themſelves upon. All our Relations, how dear and near ſoever, our Health, Eſtate, Liberty, yea, our Life, is but a Vapour, that appears but a little time, and then vaniſheth away; therefore not fit for immortal Souls to fix upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe theſe viſible temporal things, the outward good things of this World are moſt times great Enemies to our Souls, and have proved very hurtful and prejudicial to them, that have had the greateſt confluence of them, but beneficial to very few, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 15. Oh, how few have been the better for Proſperity!</p>
               <p>Now this damage and hurt to mens Souls, cometh not from thoſe good things themſelves, for they are good in themſelves, and are God's Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; but this hurt comes partly, from the Devil, and partly from mens own Corruptions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt,</hi> From the Devil, the god of this World, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. who cauſeth Miſchief to the Souls of Men, by the good things of this world, theſe ways: 1. He miſrepreſents the things of this world to Men, the Riches, Honours, and Pleaſures of it, Liberty, Health, Eaſe, Money, Eſtates, the Devil ſhews them in falſe glaſſes, and not as the God of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:34230:72"/>
Truth in his Word declares them to be; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſo they are, and not otherwiſe; but Satan repreſents them not as vain, deceitful, vexatious, and uncertain things, but as brave, glorious, ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying things; and thence men promiſe themſelves ſo much Content in them. 2. He lays Snares, Baits, and Temptations in all viſible temporal things; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9. There is not any viſible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, but there is ſome Snare, ſome Temptation at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it. 3. He over-values all temporal things to us, making them to be worth all our Affections, Strength, Time, and Pains, but undervalues Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Grace, and Glory; there he ſaith, why ſo much ado? time enough hereafter. 4. He grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens preſent Evils, as Shame, Poverty, Sickneſs, Loſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh! theſe muſt be avoided by any means, but leſſeneth eternal Evils, God's Wrath and Vengeance, and eternal Damnation: Thus the Devil makes theſe viſible temporal things hurtful to men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> This hurt comes to men through their own Luſt and Corruptions within them; without which the Devil could not hurt them; if Men had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

their Minds, that they cannot ſee that tranſcendent Beauty and unſpeakable Amiableneſs and Comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is in Jeſus Chriſt; nor their own abſolute neceſſity of him, and their undone eſtate without him: by filling their Hearts, Heads, Hands, and Time and all, ſo that there is no room for Chriſt, nor time to mind Chriſt; Profits and Pleaſures take up all their time, and carry away their Hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> They hinder men from following Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 21. <hi>All ſeek their own, not the things of Chriſt;</hi> at leaſt, they hinder men from following Chriſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and whereſoever he goes, as <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> did, and thoſe in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> 14. 4.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Now, from the conſideration of the danger we are in, from viſible temporal things, we have good reaſon to draw off our Hearts and Affections from them, and not much to mind or regard them.</p>
               <p>And indeed, our Souls are in danger on both hands, both from the good and from the evil things of this <hi>World,</hi> Proſperity and Adverſity.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p>7 <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Becauſe they have been ſo often diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and deceived by thoſe things; they never found that in them which they expected from them; the World hath ever proved falſe to them; they have tryed it, and by Experience have ever found it <hi>Vanity and Vexation,</hi> and nothing elſe.</p>
               <p>8 <hi>Reaſ.</hi> And Laſtly, Becauſe gracious Souls have Principles of Faith in them, they have the ſame Spirit of Faith in them, that thoſe Primitive Chriſtians had, and that is a <hi>victorious Principle, a World-conquering Faith,</hi> Heb. 11. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:34230:74"/>
By Faith the Soul mounts aloft, and takes a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the inviſible eternal things, being the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen; fixing its Eye upon, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with thoſe things, and ſo it overlooks, and looks beyond and above all viſible temporal things: 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 4. <hi>This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.</hi> And this I take to be the main thing intended in the Text: As if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had ſaid, <hi>We look not unto things that are ſeen;</hi> that is, we live not by ſence, but by Faith; as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. we ſet not ſence on work on viſible temporal things, but we ſet Faith on work on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible eternal things, and by our Faith on invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibles, we get victory over viſible temporal things.</p>
               <p>Q. But how doth Faith help a Soul to take it off from minding and over-much regarding viſible temporal things?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Faith doth it many ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, by carrying the Soul to pitch its Eye upon, and take a view of the inviſible God in Chriſt, and his God in Chriſt: <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 26. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw him that was inviſible, and thereby he endured the evil things of this World, and deſpiſed the Riches and Honours of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court: Alas! how vile and baſe are all earthly things, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the Eternal God, the All-ſufficient Good? And by Faith the Soul pitcheth it ſelf upon this God, and applieth and appropriateth this God to himſelf. This God is my God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. 14. <hi>I ſaid, Thou art my God;</hi> and 48. 14. <hi>This God is our God;</hi> and 73. 26. <hi>My Portion.</hi> Alſo, by Faith the Soul is carried to pitch upon Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:34230:75"/>
in whom dwells all fulneſs, and by Faith ſees his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in this Bleſſed Jeſus, and thence he is moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted aloft above all viſible temporal things, having his Affections raiſed and fixed upon Jeſus his Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, who ſits at the <hi>right hand of God, Col.</hi> 3. 1, 2. This ſight of God, and Jeſus by Faith, takes off the Minds and Thoughts of Believers from thoſe things below, having higher, better, and more excellent things above to feed and fill their Thoughts with; for no man can look up to Heaven and look down to the Earth at the ſame time; as, while <hi>Paul</hi> preſſed forward towards the mark, he forgot thoſe things which were behind; and as Jeſus is ſaid to <hi>be in Heaven, John</hi> 3. 13. that is, his Heart and Mind was there, when he was on Earth, even ſo it is in ſome meaſure with all true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <hi>their converſation is in Heaven, Phil.</hi> 3. 20.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Faith receives the Teſtimony which God hath given in his Word concerning thoſe viſible tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, that they are all <hi>vanity and vexation of ſpirit,</hi> and therefore judgeth them not worthy of too much place in their Hearts and Minds.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

Faith looks within the Veil, unto thoſe unſeen Excellencies, to thoſe inviſible Glories, to be with God, and with Jeſus, and to enjoy that full and perfect Communion with them above; and when a Soul is pitcht and fixt by Faith here, ſetled and centred on things above, then farewel deceitful World.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By Faith the Soul apprehends, as the moſt tranſcendent Excellency of thoſe things above, ſo by Faith the Soul ſees its abſolute neceſſity of thoſe things: Intereſt in God, Peace with him, Union with Chriſt, Title to Eternal Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are things not only infinitely better than all viſible temporal things; but, ſaith the believing Soul, theſe things I muſt needs have, I ſhall be eternally undone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them: It's true, I muſt have Food and Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo, theſe are neceſſary too, but not ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary: If I have God and Chriſt, I ſhall not want Food and Raiment, the faithful God hath paſt his Promiſe that I ſhall want no good thing; I may be happy for ever without Riches and Honours, without earthly Friends and Relations, without Health or Liberty, but not without God and Chriſt,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:34230:76"/>
oh! there lies my Happineſs: One thing is needful, only needful, abſolutely needful, and that is, my Intereſt in God and Chriſt; and the making ſure of that deſerves and calls for our moſt ſerious and utmoſt Thoughts and Cares.</p>
               <p>If a man were condemned to dye, whereupon would he ſpend his moſt ſerious Thoughts, but upon getting his Pardon, if there were any hopes of it, and not in providing himſelf fine Clothes, or a full Table? The application is eaſie.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By Faith a Soul is perſwaded, that neither the evil things of this World can hinder, nor the good things of this World can further his Happineſs, nor his way to it, of themſelves: but rather the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; for a man may be poor in this <hi>World,</hi> yet rich in Faith, and an Heir of the Kingdom; as, <hi>James</hi> 2. 5. and a man may be rich in this World, yet poor in Soul, and an Heir of Hell, as we ſee in <hi>Dives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Faith is a powerful, a victorious, conquering Grace: <hi>This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our Faith. Stephen</hi> was full of Faith and Power, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 8. <hi>The work of faith with power,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 11.</p>
               <p>Faith brings all viſible temporal things under the Believer's Feet; it gives the Believer power to uſe the <hi>World,</hi> and not to abuſe it, not ſeeking Reſt and Contentment in it; to uſe it moderately, without damage and detriment to the Soul; to uſe it for God's honour, its own ſpiritual advantage, and the good of others; and power to keep it out of the Heart, Chriſt dwelling there by Faith; to uſe the <hi>World,</hi> and not loſing our Hearts, our Peace, nor our Conſciences in it: Faith gives the Soul power to withſtand the Threats and Temptations of the <hi>World,</hi> and power to be willing to leave it, and

                     <hi>Inf.</hi> IV. Fourthly, it follows, that a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian lives by Faith, and not by Sence; for he that is a Captive to the <hi>World,</hi> hath but little Faith, if any; 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 4. <hi>For faith overcometh the world;</hi> where Sence riſeth, Faith falleth. Now, ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>We walk by faith, not by ſence.</hi> This is our Practice, and this is the very meaning of the Text: <hi>We look not at thoſe things that are ſeen;</hi> that is, we live not by Senſe, but by Faith.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But what is it to live or walk by Senſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The great good, or end, or happines that a carnal Heart propoſeth to it ſelf, in which it expecteth Content, is ſome good that is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Senſe, ſomething that may be ſenſibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, and this they purſue and labour after. The Rule by which they judge things, is Senſe; if things pleaſe Senſe, and ſeem good to Senſe to the Eye, to the Ear, to the Taſte, to the Appetite, they judge them to be good things; if not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the ſenſe, they are counted evil things That which affects their <hi>Hearts,</hi> is Senſe, Senſible Comforts, or Senſible Croſſes, Senſible Gain, or Senſible Loſs; wanting the light of God's Spirit to open their Underſtandings, they live only by Senſe, and are but Senſual; <hi>Jude</hi> 19. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11. 9.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:34230:79"/>
and ſo they walk after the Fleſh, and mind the things of the Fleſh, chiefly and principally. This Life of Senſe is variouſly expreſſed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>A leaning to their own underſtanding;</hi> Pſal. 81. 12. <hi>A walking after their own hearts luſts,</hi> and <hi>in their own counſels;</hi> Jer. 9. 14. <hi>Walking after the imaginations of their own hearts;</hi> Iſa. 65. 2. <hi>After their own thoughts, in a way that is not good.</hi> Iſa. 5. 21.</p>
                  <p>This is not the way of true Chriſtians; but they walk by Faith, and not by Senſe.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is it then to walk by Faith?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The great Good, or End, or Happineſs that a gracious Soul aims at, and ſeeks content in, is that which is preſented to him by Faith, out of the Word of <hi>God,</hi> and that is twofold, to wit, the glorifying of <hi>God,</hi> and the enjoyment of him; theſe are <hi>things not ſeen;</hi> theſe are not the Objects of Senſe, but of Faith: To glorifie God in Chriſt, and to enjoy God in Chriſt, this is the end of the Saints walk and way; and all this is by Faith.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Life of Faith</hi> is demonſtrated ſeveral ways.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He that lives by Faith is guided by the Word of Faith, and that is the whole Goſpel, and every Truth in it; ſuch a Soul gives up it ſelf to the conduct of the whole Word of <hi>God;</hi> it walks by no other Rule.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It yields it ſelf up to the government of the Spirit of Faith, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> it is obedient to the motions, ſtirrings, counſels of the Holy Spirit, harkning to that word behind him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30, 31. not willingly grieving nor quenching it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It walks in the way of Holineſs, for this Faith purifies the Heart; <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 9. &amp; 26. 18.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:34230:80"/>
4. It always leans upon Chriſt, and draws ſtrength from him, to hold on and hold out in the way of Duty; by it the Soul abides in Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 15. 3. and by drawing of ſtrength from Chriſt it can do all things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 13. notwithſtanding all oppoſition.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. By Faith the Soul commits himſelf to <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in all his ways, and truſts himſelf and all his concernments with <hi>God; Pſal.</hi> 37. 3, 5. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 3. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. 7, 8. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>Such a Soul can ſatisfie himſelf with what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives by Faith, as really and truly as others can ſatisfie themſelves with Senſe; the faithful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of <hi>God</hi> are as ſweet to him as the ſenſible Poſſeſſions and Enjoyments are of others, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. they ſaw the Promiſes afar off, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them.</p>
                  <p>Now, when a Soul can depend upon <hi>God</hi> alone for All, in the want of all outward means, and make progreſs in the ways of <hi>God,</hi> through all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and not draw back; and doth in his whole courſe of Life ſo walk, work, and act, as becomes one that doth believe ſuch glorious things in the other World, as he doth believe; when there is a ſuitableneſs in his Life to what he believes; then, oh then, he may truly be ſaid to live by Faith. And this is the Life that in ſome degree every true Chriſtian lives, and deſires to live; and this living by Faith, and not by Senſe, is that which is meant in the Text.</p>

II. <hi>Directions ſhewing how we may get off our Hearts, and draw off our Minds from them, for our Hearts are ſo glued to them, we cannot but look on them, and mind them.</hi>

                  <p>It is not eaſie work to do, but let us uſe the means that <hi>God</hi> hath appointed, and try what we can do.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let us labour to be transformed in the Image of our Minds, renewed in the Spirit of our Minds; <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 23. New Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we muſt get, this muſt be done; our Old Minds are vain, and altogether ſuitable to earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things.</p>

                     <hi>A.1ſt,</hi> Pray earneſtly to <hi>God,</hi> to give you new Hearts, to repair his Image on you, to create a clean Heart in you, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 10. to give you his Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12. to ſanctifie you throughout, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 23. to regenerate you by his Word and Spirit; <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 17, 18. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 3, 4, 5.

                  <p>Go to Jeſus, beg his Spirit; He was crucified to all <hi>viſible temporal things,</hi> beg of him to give you thoſe <hi>Waters of Life, Joh.</hi> 4. 14. which he hath promiſed to them that <hi>hunger and thirſt</hi> after them: Beg of him to make you of his mind; labour to put him on by imitation.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>3ly,</hi> If we would be regenerated, we muſt ſearch the Scriptures diligently, attend on the Word preached and read, for the Word of <hi>God</hi> is the Seed of Regeneration, the Word of Grace, ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to work Grace in Souls, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18.

(2.) That every Man and Woman in the World is either made for ever, or undone for ever, as they are related and entituled unto the inviſible eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal good things or evil things of the other World; they are made for ever, if related and entituled to the inviſible God and Glory; and undone for ever, if not: So that our Eternal Happineſs or Miſery depends not on our relation or title to viſible, but to inviſible things.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Such as is our Title and Eſtate now, to the one or other, ſuch it will be to all Eternity. <hi>As the tree falls, ſo it lies: as death leaves us, ſo will judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment find us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) This looking off from earthly things is the way to grow and encreaſe in Grace, for Worldly Cares do choak, deaden, and weaken Grace, cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Affections, entangling and encumbring the Thoughts, much hindring the exerciſe of Faith and Love, which are the principal Graces whereby holy Souls enjoy Communion with God.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5.) By this you will have more Communion with <hi>God;</hi> for the leſs we look downward, the more we ſhall look upward; and the more we look upward to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the actings of our Faith and Love, the more will <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> manifeſt themſelves and their love to our Souls.</p>
                  <p n="6">(6.) This will ſupport us in Affliction, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us in a dying hour; when our Affections are crucified to the World, we ſhall not be <hi>unwilling</hi> to part with it. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>We are dead,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; that is, to the World.

                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> by way of Examination. By this gracious frame of Spirit, we may know our ſpiritual ſtate, whether we be born of <hi>God</hi> or no, whether in <hi>Chriſt</hi> or no; to wit, by this, Whether our Hearts and Minds are more ſet on God, Chriſt, and Heaven, or on the World. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> they are ſafe, come Plague, Sword, Fire, Faggot: But who are in Chriſt Jeſus? He tells us, <hi>They that walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi> So Ver. 5, 6. <hi>They that are ſpiritually minded; they that have their converſation in Heaven.</hi> Phil. 3. 20. Col. 3. 1, 2. <hi>They are riſen with Chriſt.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 25, 26. If we be born from Heaven, we are bound for Heaven: Heavenly-mindedneſs is as good an Evidence for Heaven as any is, and Earthly-mindedneſs is as ill a Character as can be. Let us now try our ſelves by this: Where are our Hearts, and Minds, and Affections moſtly ſet, on Heaven or Earth, on Chriſt or the Creature?

judge truly and rightly of them. Now God hath declared in his Word his Judgment of them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. 6, 7. <hi>The mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken this. The voice ſaid, Cry; and he ſaid, What ſhall I cry? All fleſh is graſs, and all the goodlineſs thereof as the flower of the field. The graſs withereth, the flower fadeth.</hi> Pſal. 39. 5, 6. <hi>Verily, every man, at his beſt eſtate, is altogether vanity. Surely, every man walketh in a vain ſhew,</hi> Pſal. 103. 14, 15. we are but Duſt: <hi>As for man, his days are as graſs: as a flower of the field, ſo he flouriſheth. For the wind paſſeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof ſhall know it no more.</hi> Job 14. 1, 2. <hi>Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth alſo as a ſhadow, and continueth not.</hi> So 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 24. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 10. &amp; 4. 14. <hi>What is our life? It is but even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vaniſheth away.</hi> This is the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>God</hi> concerning Man, all Men; They are but <hi>Duſt,</hi> but a <hi>Shadow,</hi> but <hi>Graſs,</hi> and the Life of Man <hi>very ſhort, and full of trouble,</hi> but even as a <hi>bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> but a <hi>vapour;</hi> and we may be ſure, that the Judgment of God is according to Truth. And then, for all the things of this World, <hi>Solomon,</hi> by the Spirit of God, hath declared what they all are. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Vanity of vanities, ſaith the Preacher, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of vanities, all is vanity.</hi> Vanity and Vexation. Riches, Honours, Pleaſures, Relations, Friends, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, all pleaſant Accommodations, <hi>all is vanity and vexation of ſpirit.</hi> This is the true and right Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we ſhould have of all earthly things.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) We muſt judge of theſe earthly things by the experience of the beſt and wiſeſt men that ever lived upon Earth; they will <hi>tell</hi> us from their own experience, that they are <hi>all vanity and vexation. So Solomon, Job, David, Moſes;</hi> Pſal. 90, 4, 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:34230:85"/>
Yea, we all know this by our own Experiences every day, that <hi>all fleſh is as graſs, and as the flower of the field:</hi> How ſoon do all our earthly Comforts wither and periſh, our deareſt and neareſt Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wither and dye away, our Health and Strength, our Life, and all, ſtill withering and periſhing? <hi>[See largely of this in Dr.</hi> Reynold<hi>'s Three Treatiſes, the firſt part, concerning the vanity of the Creature.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Once more judge of Earthly things by the evil uſe we make of them while we have them, through Satan's Temptations and our own Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, (as was ſhewed before) and alſo what cloggs and hinderances they are to our Souls, in our way to Heaven: Altho' Life, and all the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations of Life, as Health, Strength, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Eſtate, Friends are good things in themſelves, and given us to be helps to Holineſs, and to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; yet we muſt confeſs to our ſhame, that all our Earthly Comforts, yea, and our animal Life it ſelf, doth very much, moſt times, hinder our Communion with <hi>God,</hi> hinder us in the Service of <hi>God,</hi> keep our Hearts at too great a diſtance from God; and many more Evils they bring upon us; all which conſidered, we have but little reaſon ſo to value them as we do, nor to let our Hearts and Affections ſo to run out after them. Thus let us take a right judgment of <hi>all</hi> Earthly things. It is true, that ſo far forth as theſe Earthly things are uſeful to us in the Service of God, and further the good of our Souls, ſo far forth we ought to love and prize them, and praiſe <hi>God</hi> for them, and pray for the continuance of them; but ſo far forth as they are hinderances to us in Holineſs, and bring Sin and Guilt on our Souls, as too oft they do, ſo far forth, and in that reſpect, we had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be without them than with them; their Room
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:34230:86"/>
would be better than their Company: And when they prove Snares to us, and like <hi>Solomon's</hi> Wives draw away our Hearts from <hi>God;</hi> and like <hi>Dali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi> to <hi>Sampſon,</hi> betray our Souls into the hands of our ſpiritual Enemies; then ſurely it is the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>God</hi> to ſeparate them from us, and ſtrip us of them, and we ſhall have cauſe to bleſs God for ſo doing.</p>
                  <p>Sickneſs and Weakneſs improved, is better for our Souls than Health and Strength abuſed: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint and Confinement improved, better than Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty abuſed: Solitarineſs improved, is better than a Family and Company abuſed: Poverty impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, better than Riches abuſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus you may get a right Judgment of Earthly things.</p>
                  <p>Q. 2. <hi>But how will this right Judgment of Earthly things help us to bear our Troubles in this World?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. By acting our Faith upon the Word of <hi>God.</hi> Believe, and be fully perſwaded of the truth, which God, the <hi>God of Truth,</hi> hath ſpoken concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all Earthly things: Believe that <hi>all fleſh is graſs,</hi> that <hi>life is but a vapour, &amp;c.</hi> here lies the root of all our Impatience and Diſcontent under our Loſſes and Earthly Comforts, even our Unbelief; we do not <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>firmly</hi> believe they are ſuch vain things that we are deprived of, out <hi>graſs,</hi> but <hi>as the flowers of the field.</hi> Juſt like a man that finds a Box or Bag of Counters, and takes them to be all pure Gold, and greatly rejoycech in what he hath found; then after a ſhort time he loſeth his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and then he is exceedingly troubled for the loſs of them, becauſe all this while he took them for Gold; but if once he comes to believe, that it was but a Box or Bag of Counters, then he grieves
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:34230:86"/>
no more. So it is with us; we believe not, that all our Comforts are <hi>vanity and vexation;</hi> we look not on them to be ſo, but that there is much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, and ſweetneſs, and ſatisfaction to be had in them: And therefore we grieve immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately when we loſe our Counters; but if we did firmly believe they are but Counters, Shadows, Graſs, Vapours, we ſhould not be ſo caſt down.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Meditation and Conſideration of the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all Earthly things, as God hath ſhewed us in his Word; often thinking, pondering, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating on their vanity, uncertainty, tranſitorineſs and deceitſulneſs: Without this due and ſerious Meditation, a right Judgment of them will do us no good. When God ſmites our Comforts, maketh our faireſt Flowers to wither, blaſteth our flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Graſs, then let us conſider what God hath ſmitten and blaſted, nothing but graſs, but flowers. What have we loſt? Nothing but Shadows, but Counters: This deep Conſideration will ſupport us under our Loſſes. Conſider alſo the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Saints, who in <hi>all Ages</hi> have found theſe things to be but <hi>vanity and vexation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Add Prayer to God, That He will through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convince your Minds of the vanity of <hi>all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> prayed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 4. That we may judge of them as <hi>God</hi> judgeth of them, and not otherwiſe; and then it will not ſo much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us to part with them. So much for a right Judgment of the good things of this World: We muſt alſo labour to get a right Judgment of the evil things of this World, as Poverty, Sickneſs, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, Diſgrace, loſs of Friends and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; we uſually judge amiſs of theſe alſo, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore become impatient.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:34230:87"/>
Now, that we may have a right Judgment of theſe things alſo, we muſt obſerve the former Rules.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To judge of theſe Evil things as God in his Word judgeth of them. Now God tells us in his Word, that <hi>Afflictions are ſhort and light;</hi> that is comparatively, as was ſhewed before; that his ends and deſigns in all the Afflictions of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are good and gracious; of which largely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; that they are Tokens of his Fatherly Love to us, and Evidences of our Sonſhip; that they are for our ſpiritual and eternal profit, to take away our Sins, and to make us partakers of his Holineſs, and to prepare us for that <hi>far more excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and eternal weight of glory;</hi> that they are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and neceſſary for us, Afflictions being as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to God's People, in their paſſage to Heaven, as Water is to a Ship, to carry her to her Port.</p>
                  <p>Now, if we judge of Afflictions thus, as the On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-wiſe God judgeth of them, we ſhall bear them with much patience.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To judge of them as the wiſe, good, and holy men of God do judge of them. <hi>Moſes</hi> choſe rather <hi>to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon.</hi> Holy <hi>David</hi> profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, That <hi>it was good for him that he was afflicted, Pſal.</hi> 119. 71. <hi>[<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which Text I have written at large by it ſelf.]</hi> So the Primitive Chriſtians, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17, 18. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 34. And thouſands now in Heaven, and upon Earth, can ſeal to this Truth, That Afflictions have done them good.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let us judge alſo by our own Experiences, that as the good things of this World have been, by Satan's Temptations, and our own Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, very hurtful to our Souls; ſo the evil things of this World have been, through the <hi>Grace of</hi>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:34230:87"/>
                     <hi>God,</hi> ſanctifying them to us, very profitable to our Souls, and we have cauſe to bleſs <hi>God</hi> for them.</p>
                  <p>And as Earthly things, good in themſelves, become evil to us, ſo evil things, ſo in themſelves, but by the Bleſſing of <hi>God</hi> on them, become good into us.</p>
                  <p>Now this right Judgment of the evil things of this World, will much ſupport us under them,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If we ſtrongly act our Faith in believing that <hi>God</hi> in his Word hath ſaid of theſe Evil things, that they <hi>are all but light and ſhort,</hi> that He hath ſuch gracious ends in them; and if we act faith and Hope upon the many exceeding great and precious Promiſes in the Word, made to his People in their Afflictions, and relye upon his faithfulneſs in them, we ſhall be ſweetly ſupported under them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we duly meditate and conſider of the good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <q>O my Soul! Can I be a true Chriſtian, and be a Stranger to this Practice of converſing with thoſe inviſible eternal things?

                  <p>The Grounds and Reaſons of the Point, Why gracious Souls do moſt ſeriouſly mind, intend and aim at in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible eternal things.</p>

II. Becauſe truly-gracious Souls are endued with inviſible, divine, and eternal Principles, which do encline, diſpoſe, and ſuit them to thoſe <hi>inviſible and eternal things: Jam.</hi> 1. 17, 18. They are begotten of God, born of God; their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is heavenly; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. They muſt needs mind God, for they are begotten of him, He is their Father, they have his Image on them; and they muſt needs mind Chriſt, for he is formed in them; and the Spirit, for they are born of the Spirit: Heaven is their Father's Houſe, their own Home, their Inheritance; the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Divine Nature enclines and diſpoſeth them to mind things above. As <hi>they that are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh, do mind the things of the fleſh,</hi> ſo <hi>they that are after the ſpirit, do mind the things of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> for this is the characteriſtical difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>carnal</hi> and the <hi>spiritual man, Rom.</hi> 8. 5, 6. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 4. Every thing acts according to its Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. If Men and Women have no other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in them, but ſuch as they brought into the World with them, which are only earthly, and have no other Spirit than the Spirit of the World i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But holy Souls have Principles of the Divine Life, and they live the Life of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Becauſe their Hopes are ſet, grounded, fixed on thoſe inviſible eternal things; their hopes are not in this Life, but in God, in Chriſt; Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Heaven, and Eternal Life, are the Objects of the hopes of all truly-gracious Souls; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18, 19. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14.

                  <p n="4">IV. Becauſe the People of God have had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in ſome meaſure of the ſweet and powerful Influences and Operations of thoſe inviſible eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things on their own Hearts and Spirits; they have taſted that the Lord is gracious; they have had fellowſhip with the Father and the Son, in ſome degree; they have been made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, in many ſaving fruits and effects on them; they have felt the power, efficacy, and comfort of the Word and Promiſes; and they have in ſome meaſure received the <hi>firſt-fruits</hi> and <hi>earneſt</hi> of their <hi>Inheritance; Rom.</hi> 8. 23. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13, 14.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Becauſe by all theſe things gracious Souls live, and in all theſe things is the Life of their Souls: Their Life is hid with Chriſt in God, and ſhould they not mind God and Chriſt? Chriſt liveth in them, and they in him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. They live in the Spirit, and walk in the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. They live by, and live upon the Promiſes, <hi>Job</hi> 23. 12. They live by Faith, in the purchaſed, promiſed, prepared Inheritance; they live in hope of <hi>Eternal Life, Tit.</hi> 1. 2. and <hi>rejoyce in hope of glory, Rom.</hi> 5. 2: They live in hope of a better Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; they groan after their Houſe in Heaven; they ſeek a Country, an heavenly; and therefore they cannot but mind and intend, look unto, and aim at thoſe inviſible eternal things. Our natural Life, much leſs our ſpiritual Life, doth not conſiſt in the things which we poſſeſs; that is, in viſible temporal things; for, <hi>in</hi> God <hi>we live, move, and have our being.</hi>

VI. Becauſe theſe inviſible eternal things are the only things that are ſuitable and ſatisfying to the Souls of gracious perſons; Earthly things are not ſuitable to Heaven-born Souls; Riches, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Pleaſures, not ſuitable, nor ſatisfying to immortal Souls, which are begotten of God: Earthly things are no Bread for Souls; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 2, 3, 4. <hi>John</hi> 6. 27. They are all but Aſhes, but Wind, Huſks, Chaff, not Food for Souls; theſe are ſuitable to the Body, Meats for the Belly, and the Belly for Meats; but God, and Chriſt, and the Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the Soul, for the renewed gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soul; other things will not content it.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. Becauſe theſe inviſible eternal things are the beſt, the choiceſt, the chiefeſt, the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things, the principal things, as <hi>all</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, and therefore moſt worthy to be minded and looked after; <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 8. GOD and Glory, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Happineſs, are the beſt things for certain, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 34. &amp; 11. 16. The Saints Happineſs lies in thoſe inviſible eternal things: They may be happy without viſible temporal things, but they can never be happy without the other: And indeed, all viſible temporal things are not worth minding at all in compariſon of the other. Oh, that we could believe this, and act accordingly.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. Becauſe thoſe things are moſt ſure and certain, <hi>incorruptible and undefiled,</hi> and <hi>that fade not away, Matth.</hi> 6. 19. <hi>nor moth, nor ruſt, nor thieves</hi> can <hi>ſpoil</hi> us of theſe; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 9, 10. &amp; 13. 14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48. 14. <hi>This God will be our God for ever.</hi> None can ſay ſo of Relations or Poſſeſſions, of Health, Wealth, or Liberty.

IX. Becauſe by minding of, and by ſetting their Affections upon thoſe inviſible eternal things, they are much freed and diſcharged from the Snares, Fears, Cares, Sorrows, Entanglements, Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances and Temptations, that accompany the minding of thoſe viſible temporal things. <hi>Nil ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit in Nervo, cum Anima ſit in Coelo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh, the intolerable Burthens, the unavoidable Snares, Cares, and Fears that attend theſe earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things! how are the Minds of Men rack'd, tortured, diſtracted, diſtempered, macerated with theſe? while they mind them eagerly and inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately, What croſs Paſſages fall out? what Diſappointments do they meet with? how ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are mens Minds bewitched with theſe things? what unruly Paſſions are oftentimes ſtirred up, and thence they break out into many uncomely words and actions, piercing themſelves thorow with many Sorrows, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 10. Againſt this our Lord caution'd his Diſciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 34. <hi>Take heed, leſt at any time your hearts be overcharged with ſurfeiting, and drunkenneſs, and cares of this life.</hi> And by theſe worldly entanglements many times God is forgotten, Conſcience wounded, Peace broken, Guilt contracted, Duty neglected, and Sorrows multiplied.</p>
                  <p>But now, when we can get off our Hearts from Earthly things, and can get them up above theſe things, and can fix our Minds upon thoſe high and heavenly things; how are our Spirits diſcharged and diſburthened, and our Minds eaſed and quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 5, 6. <hi>My ſoul ſhall be ſatisfied as with marrow and fatneſs: When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night-watches.</hi>

O, the ſweet Peace and Tranquility of Mind that thoſe enjoy, that <hi>look above,</hi> and <hi>live above,</hi> and have their <hi>converſation in Heaven;</hi> who walk with God, and talk with God, and conſtantly converſe with things above: <hi>To be spiritually min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded is life and peace,</hi> Rom. 8. 6.</p>
                  <p n="10">X.

1 <hi>Inference.</hi> Hence appears the extream Folly and Madneſs of People by Nature, who look at, mind and aim only at viſible temporal things, but totally neglect Inviſible eternal things. God, Chriſt, Heaven, is not in all, ſcarce in any of their Thoughts; <hi>Lovers of</hi> themſelves, of their own things, of Profits and <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> more than of God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 21. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 4. that make themſelves the Mark they aim at; but the Glory and Honour of God, the pleaſing and enjoying him, are ſtrange things to them, things they never minded, never thought on: God complains of this againſt the Jews, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8. 12. <hi>I have written to them the great things of my Law, but they counted them as strange things.</hi> So may Jeſus Chriſt juſtly complain of Men under the Goſpel; <q>I have revealed the great and glorious Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, the Myſteries of Salvation, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable Riches of the Grate and Love of <hi>God</hi> in the Goſpel.</q> Life and Immortality is brought to light by the Goſpel; the true and only way to Heaven and Eternal Life, to Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Happineſs, is clearly made known in the Goſpel; the only Means to get an Intereſt in the great God, in Jeſus Chriſt, in the New Covenant; how to get Pardon of Sin, Peace with God; how to be juſtified, ſaved, and glorified for ever; <hi>All theſe things</hi> are <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>clearly</hi> revealed in the Goſpel. The inviſible eternal things of the World to come, which are the greateſt Realities
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:34230:97"/>
and Excellencies, the choiceſt, greateſt, and beſt things. But woe, and alas! how little are thoſe things minded? It is <hi>Corn, Wine,</hi> and <hi>Oyl;</hi> Who will ſhew us any good, any viſible temporal good?</p>
                  <p>Now, is not this extream Folly and Madneſs, for reaſonable Creatures, made for God, made capable of enjoying God, and all thoſe inviſible eternal good things; for them thus to labour and pant after the Duſt of the Earth, to ſpend their Thoughts, Minds, and Strengths upon that which cannot ſatisfie, which will not endure; but thus to waſte precious Time, and Breath, and Spirits for periſhing fading things, and neglect inviſible eternal things; the incorruptible Crown, that <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not away,</hi> the undefiled Inheritance, the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Kingdom, eternal Life and Salvation; not to look on thoſe, nor mind them, nor labour for them: Yet this is the common neglect of the World. It is amazing Madneſs, aſtoniſhing Folly. Thus God expreſſeth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13. <hi>Be aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, O ye heavens, at this; be ye horribly afraid; be ye very deſolate, ſaith the Lord: For my people have committed two evils; they have forſaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed out Ciſterns, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Ciſterns, that can hold no water. Prov.</hi> 1. 20, 21, 22. Yet ſuch is the Madneſs of <hi>all</hi> by Nature, and it is greatly to be lamented.</p>
                  <p>This ſhews alſo the blindneſs and darkneſs of Men by Nature, that they cannot ſee the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of thoſe inviſible eternal things, nor their own abſolute neceſſity of them, and concernment in them: The God of this World hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, leſt the Light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the Image of God, ſhould ſhine into them: This glorious light
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:34230:97"/>
ſhines upon them, and ſhines into many of their Heads; this Light they cannot reſiſt; but it ſhines not into their Hearts, to transform and change them, as it doth into the Hearts of God's Elect; and it's greatly to be lamented; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Inf.</hi> Secondly, Hence appears the beguiling, bewitching nature of the World, that it ſhould ſo ſtrangely win and gain the Hearts and Affections of Men and Women, and ſo eaſily prevail with them, while God and Chriſt are offered to them, and are not embraced: Heaven gates are opened to them, and they invited, entreated, perſwaded by Promiſes, by Threatnings, commanded to come and enter, but they will not; they make light of it; no Perſwaſions will prevail; they turn the deaf Ear to all: But for the World, how ſoon are Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple perſwaded to embrace it, to follow hard after it, to count no Time nor Pains too much to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it?</p>
                  <p>What is there in thoſe viſible temporal things, in thoſe glittering vanities, that ſhould ſo allure, entice, and ſeduce rational Souls, and ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that they believe all thoſe better things? But indeed, they do not believe them, whatever they profeſs: Infidelity is the Root of all; Men do not believe what they profeſs to believe. It were impoſſible that the World ſhould be ſo heartily, ſo eagerly follow'd and purſued, if the vanity and vexation of it, the emptineſs and inſufficiency of it, the uncertainty and tranſitorineſs of it, were indeed believed: It were impoſſible that the great and glorious <hi>God,</hi> the Alſufficient Good, that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Jeſus, that Heaven and Eternal Happineſs, ſhould be ſo ſlighted and neglected, if they were <hi>truly, really,</hi> and <hi>heartily believed.</hi>

It is moſt ſtrange, and yet moſt true, that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould yield up their Hearts unto, and ſpend their beſt Affections upon the things of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent evil World, and can think and ſpeak <hi>delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> of them, but have no mind to think or ſpeak of <hi>eternal things.</hi> Oh, this beguiling, bewitching, and deceiving World! and, oh, theſe corrupt, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, deceitful Hearts of ours, that ſuffer the World thus to deceive us!</p>
                  <p>It coſt the Heart-blood of Chriſt to deliver his People from this preſent evil World, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 4. Could we apprehend the Miſchief this World hath done us, and doth ſtill do us, we ſhould have but <hi>little</hi> kindneſs for it; and if once we could attain the Aſſurance of our title to that World above, we ſhould not care how ſoon we were gone out of this.</p>

Alas, we rejoice in things of nought, and are grieved for the loſs of Shadows; for ſuch, and no better at beſt, are all <hi>viſible temporal things,</hi> in compariſon of <hi>inviſible eternal things.</hi> Let us all bewail this Folly: O, when ſhall we be wiſe?

Oh, how long e're we be able to diſcern between Good and Evil? till we know the one thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:34230:98"/>
and approve and purſue the things which are moſt excellent? and give up our Hearts entirely to God and Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>4 <hi>Inf.</hi> Fourthly, Hence appears the abſolute Neceſſity of Regeneration: Seeing we are by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo ignorant, dark, blind, ſtupid and dead, that we cannot ſee nor underſtand the things of God, nor the things that belong to our own Eternal Peace: Therefore we ſhould earneſtly ſeek and pray for Renewing Grace, and that Chriſt would give us the <hi>Light of Life;</hi> and that God would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get us anew, and give us his ſanctifying quick'ning Spirit, and infuſe new ſpiritual Principles of the Divine Nature into our Hearts, and thereby take us off from inordinate minding <hi>viſible temporal things,</hi> and turn our minds another way, even to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Himſelf, and towards Chriſt and Heaven, that there we may center and place all the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Hearts, all the Deſires and Delights of our Souls: This muſt be done by the mighty power of God, and we muſt ſeek him diligently, to effect this work upon us; and we muſt alſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend on his Word preached and read, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently and conſcientiouſly read the Word, ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures for this very end and purpoſe, and ſervently beg God's Bleſſing on the Word, that it may prove to us a Word of Grace, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing, converting, ſanctifying Word, the Seed of Regeneration. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 17, 18. <hi>Of his own will begat he us, by the word of truth.

                  </p>
                  <p>We <hi>All</hi> hope to go to Heaven when we dye, and to enjoy <hi>all thoſe inviſible eternal good things,</hi> do we not? Let us be ſo kind to our own Souls, as to try our Title, and the grounds of our Hopes: Sure here is one Mark, by which we may know whether our Hopes be well grounded or no; to wit, by our Heavenly-mindedneſs. What do we aim at mainly, mind chiefly, look on, and look after principally? Is it <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Earth? Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> or <hi>Inviſibles?</hi> Let us examine our ſelves: Which way runs the Stream of our Thoughts, the Current of our Affections, the Tide of our Diſcourſes? Which way runs it ſtrongeſt, ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt? Put this Queſtion cloſe to our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and require a direct Anſwer: Let us not <hi>dally</hi> and <hi>ſhuffle,</hi> but be ſerious. Our Apoſtle makes this a diſcriminating Character of a Child of God, of one in Chriſt, and above the power of Condemnation, of one that is born again: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 5. <hi>They that are after the fleſh, do mind the things of the fleſh;</hi> the Profits, Honours, Pleaſures, Eaſe, Health, Liberty, of the Fleſh; that is, they mind theſe things <hi>mainly, moſtly, principally, chiefly;</hi> moſt heartily, moſt ſeriouſly, moſt affectionately, moſt delightfully. Theſe <hi>viſible temporal things</hi> lye moſt upon their Thoughts, and lye neareſt their Hearts. This is their Character, and it appears in <hi>all</hi> their Words and Actions.</p>
                  <p>But they that are after the Spirit, that is, are born of the Spirit, born of God, are in Chriſt, they mind the things of the Spirit; the grace, the work, the witneſs, the comfort and joy or the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; they mind the things which the Spirit hath revealed in the Word; God, and Peace with him;
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:34230:99"/>
Chriſt, and Union with him; God's Covenant, and Intereſt therein; Eternal Life, and Title thereto; theſe inviſible eternal things, they mind theſe mainly, chiefly, moſtly, principally, moſt heartily, affectionately, and moſt delightfully and conſtantly. This is their Character, and this is manifeſt alſo in their Words and Actions. Now, let us try our ſelves; What Character have we? Which of theſe two? If we will not do ſo much for our own Souls, as to take a little pains in trying, we have not much love to them. A man may know very much of his State by this: And is it not worth a little Labour, to know whether we be in Chriſt, or no; and whether we ſhall be Saved or Damned eternally? Let us put it home to our Conſciences: Say, O my Soul! what doſt thou mind moſt? What are thy Thoughts moſt exerciſed about? Whereupon are thy Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions moſt fixedly ſet? This is a ſearching mark; oh, that we did all try our ſelves by it! we ſhould be much more heavenly than we are.</p>
                  <p>The beſt of us all will have cauſe of ſhame and ſorrow, cauſe of ſelf-ſuſpicion and jealouſie, when we ſtrictly compare our ſelves with this Rule; we ſhall find our Hearts ſo earthly, ſo carnal, our Minds ſo fleſhly, ſo ſet upon viſible temporal things, but our Thoughts on inviſible eternal things; ſo ſhort, ſo weak, ſo inconſtant, ſo ſeldom, ſo ſoon tired, and our Affections ſo unſetled, ſo unfixed, that we ſhall have great cauſe to bewail our ſelves, and cry out with St. <hi>Paul, O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death: Rom.</hi> 7. 24. And this will make us cry to God alſo, to renew the Spirits of our Minds, and to transform the Image of our Minds; and this ſhould make us look up to God's Covenant

except we lay aſide the Sin that doth ſo eaſily beſet us; in ſome, Paſſion; in ſome, Wearineſs of well-doing; in others, Pride or Covetouſneſs, is the Sin that doth eaſily beſet them: This muſt be hid aſide, whatever it be; it muſt be repented of, and reformed, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 22.

they have no Society with the Birds of Prey; They are Chriſt's Sheep, what have they to do among Swine? They are his Children, what have they to do among his Enemies? We are not aware of the very great miſchief that carnal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany doth bring to our Souls.

Doth it ſupport under Trouble? Let us ſee that it be Faith unfeigned, the Faith of <hi>God</hi>'s Elect.</p>
                  <p>Have we with all our Hearts choſen the Lord for our Portion, and placed our Happineſs in him, fixed our beſt Loves, Deſires, and Delights in him, and have we reſigned up our whole ſelves cordially and unreſervedly to him?</p>
                  <p>Have we broken our League with all Sin, and with all the Idols of our Hearts? Do we hate and deteſt all Sin, and do we keep a continual watch and war againſt all Sin?</p>
                  <p>Have we an equal reſpect to all <hi>God's</hi> Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Can we deny our ſelves, and part with all things for Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>Are we the Heirs of the Promiſes? If we be really <hi>Chriſt's, then are we Heirs of the Promiſes; Gal.</hi> 3. 29.</p>

Are we the Children of <hi>God? If Children, then Heirs, Heirs of</hi> all thoſe inviſible eternal things; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17.</p>
                  <p>Now, if we be the Children of <hi>God,</hi> we are led by the Spirit of <hi>God, Rom.</hi> 8. 15.

                  <p>And when we can prove our Right to them, and can call them our own, then ſurely we ſhall think on them; our Hearts and Minds will be ſet upon them, all our Affections will be carried out after them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 24, 25, 26. <hi>Whom have I in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but thee? and there is none upon Earth that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire beſides thee.

                  <p>Whither are we bound? Where are we travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? Where is our Home, our long Home, our laſt, our everlaſting Home? Where is our Treaſure?

O, dare not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it any longer; begin it preſently; call upon God to renew and raiſe thy Heart.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Let us learn that bleſſed Art of Spirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing earthly things, every earthly Mercy, to a Child of <hi>God,</hi> is a taſte of Eternal Mercy; every viſible temporal thing diſcovers ſomewhat of invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible eternal things: This is a ſweet work, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God and Heaven in the Creatures: As for inſtance; When we ſit down at Table, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:34230:106"/>
there is a time coming, when we ſhall ſit down with Chriſt, and eat and drink at his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in his Kingdom; that is, we ſhall enjoy free and intimate Communion with him in Heaven: And let us labour to raiſe our Hearts from tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to ſpiritual things, and be much in praiſing, adoring, and admiring God in the Creatures.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Be convinced alſo, that all our happineſs and comfort, both here and hereafter for ever, lyeth not in any, or all, of the ſenſible temporal things, but <hi>all</hi> lyeth in thoſe inviſible eternal things: It lyeth not in having <hi>Honours, Riches, Pleaſures,</hi> &amp;c. for a man may be happy without them, as <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> were; and miſerable with them, as <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Ahab, Dives,</hi> and others were. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. 15. <hi>Yea, happy are the people whoſe God is the Lord.</hi> Happy indeed, if <hi>God, Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> be ours, happy for ever, or elſe miſerable for ever.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And Laſtly, Let us labour to be renewed in the Spirit of our Minds, or elſe we ſhall never ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly and heartily mind inviſible eternal things; as was ſhewed before. We muſt get thoſe inviſible eternal Principles of Renewing Grace planted in our <hi>Hearts,</hi> the Divine Nature, the Life of <hi>God,</hi> the Spirit of our heavenly Father, to renew our Spirits, or elſe we ſhall never mind thoſe things in good earneſt; for which purpoſe, let us go to <hi>God,</hi> call, cry to him for Renewing Grace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 10. Let us look up to, and lay hold on God's Covenant, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 19. go to the Promiſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 13. <hi>If you, being evil, know how to give good things to your children, how much more will your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father give his spirit to thoſe that ask him?</hi> A precious Promiſe indeed; let us reſt upon this
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:34230:106"/>
Promiſe, and moſt earneſtly beg <hi>God</hi> to perform it to us. Old Bottles will not hold new Wine, nor old Hearts retain Heavenly things: New Hearts we muſt have, heavenly, holy Hearts, or we ſhall never mind heavenly things as we ought.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>Motives to this Duty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider, that thus to look unto, and mind inviſible eternal things, is the expreſs Character of every true Chriſtian. No man can approve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a true Chriſtian, and be a total Stranger to this Work; for, to be a true Chriſtian, is to be like Chriſt. Now Jeſus Chriſt minded thoſe invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible eternal things, as is moſt evident in the whole courſe of his Life; his Heart was in Heaven while his Body was on Earth, <hi>John</hi> 3. 13. Shall we profeſs our ſelves Chriſtians, and not be like Chriſt, nor have the Character of Chriſtians?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider, this will be a ſure ſign and clear evidence to us, of our intereſt in, and title to all thoſe inviſible eternal good things in the other World; <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 20, 21. Where the Heart is, there the Treaſure is. If our Hearts and Minds, Thoughts and Affections are on <hi>God,</hi> on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Heaven,</hi> it is a ſure ſign that theſe are ours. An heavenly Mind is as good a ſign that we belong to Heaven as any is; as was alſo ſhewed before.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This will begin our Heaven upon Earth; theſe heavenly things minded, affected, delighted in, will yield ſuch joy and comfort, as to begin our very Heaven here; when Faith and Hope, Joy and Praiſe, Love, Deſire and Delight are exerciſed on <hi>God,</hi> and on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> we ſhall be filled with Joy and Peace; as, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:34230:107"/>
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. 7. Oh, then let us labour to begin our Heaven here, by our Heavenly-mindedneſs.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This will yield Contentment and Comfort, Satisfaction and Peace to our Souls in every condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: It will ſweeten every bitter Cup: To think on <hi>God</hi> as our Father, and on Chriſt as our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, Head, and Husband, and on all the ſweet Promiſes, of which we are Heirs, what comfort will this bring to our Souls? <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 33. <hi>He doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.</hi> Iſa. 63. 9. <hi>In all their afflictions he was afflicted, and the Angel of his preſence ſaved them: in his love, and in his pitty he redeemed them, and he bare them, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them all the days of old.</hi> Rom. 8. 28. <hi>All things ſhall work together for good to them that love God.</hi> With many other exceeding great and precious Promiſes, which our good <hi>God</hi> hath made, that our Faith might feed upon them, and find ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or elſe our Souls would faint.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This will fit us for every Duty to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man:</hi> The more we think on God and heavenly things, the more conſcientious ſhall we be in our Duties to Man; becauſe it is for the Lord's ſake, from whom we look for the Reward; as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks to Servants, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 5, 6, 7. And for Duties to <hi>God,</hi> it will make us ſerve <hi>God</hi> cheerfully, delightfully, and conſtantly, having the Glory of God, the enjoyment of him, and the <hi>Recompence of Reward</hi> in our Eye: Oh, how will it quicken, raiſe, animate, and encourage us! For why are all thoſe great and glorious, inviſible, eternal things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and promiſed to us, but that we ſhould mind them, aim at them, and live in the lively hopes, and comfortable expectations of enjoying them? <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6, 24. &amp; 1. 1, 2, 3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. laſt. <hi>Therefore be stedfaſt, unmovable, always abounding in</hi>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:34230:107"/>
                     <hi>the work of the Lord, foraſmuch as ye know your labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. This will ſerve to encreaſe and ſtrengthen Grace; for the more we mind thoſe inviſible eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things; the ſtronger will be our Love, our Faith, our Hope, and our Patience; yea, the more heavenly and ſpiritual we ſhall grow; and the more uſeful, ſavory, and profitable in all our Diſcourſes. By our heavenly-mindedneſs we <hi>ſhall ſmell of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> in all our Converſes and Communications, to the advantage of others.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. This is one principal way of enjoying Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God here in this World; for by this we open our hearts to God, raiſe up our Deſires after him, ſpend our Thoughts and Affections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; and in theſe heavenly Meditations God communicates his Light and Love, his Grace and Peace to our Souls. By theſe Meditations on invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible eternal things, our Souls converſe with God, talk with God, walk with God, have our converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with God; and this is moſt ſweet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentful to gracious Souls; this is to live in God, and to live the Life of God; and it is the ſum of all our happineſs here and hereafter. The enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God's good preſence here, in acts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, will produce greatneſs of Joy; and the enjoyment of God's glorious preſence here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, in the uninterrupted Acts of Communion with him in <hi>Heaven,</hi> will produce <hi>fulneſs of joy, and pleaſures for evermore, Pſal.</hi> 16. laſt.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. By this looking to, and affectionately mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>inviſible eternal things,</hi> we ſhall be more and more changed into the image and likeneſs of them. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>We all with open face beholding as in a glaſs, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image, from glory to glory, even as by the ſpirit of the</hi>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:34230:108"/>
                     <hi>Lord.</hi> Theſe believing, loving ſights of heavenly things will change us into the image of them.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. By this we ſhall be made more and more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and deſirous to leave this World, and to go to a better. Compare this Text with the beginning of the next Chapter, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3. the Apoſtle having ſaid, <hi>We look not on viſible temporal things, but on thoſe things which are not ſeen, which are eternal;</hi> preſently adds, for we know that <hi>when the earthly houſe of this tabernacle is diſſolved, we have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens;</hi> for in this <hi>(Houſe)</hi> we groan earneſtly to be clothed upon with our <hi>Houſe</hi> which is from <hi>Heaven.</hi> And this made <hi>Paul</hi> deſire to be diſſolved that he might <hi>be with Chriſt,</hi> which was far better, or beſt of all; <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, ſuch as really apprehend, and truly believe thoſe <hi>inviſible eternal things,</hi> and their title to them and portion in them, will be <hi>really willing</hi> to dye, that they may enjoy them, knowing that they lye on the other ſide of Death, and cannot be enjoyed, but by dying, and after Death, Death being the In-let to all that purchaſed, promiſed Glory. Now, the more we do ſeriouſly think and meditate on thoſe glorious things, the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling we ſhall be to leave all thoſe fading, vain, and vexing Comforts, to enjoy thoſe eternal Delights: And it is a great Mercy and ſweet Priviledge to be willing to dye; and I know nothing will more effect this willingneſs in us.</p>
                  <p>Now, let all thoſe Motives effectually perſwade us to draw off our hearts from thoſe <hi>viſible temporal things,</hi> and to ſet our Affections <hi>upon things above.</hi> How long ſhall vain Thoughts lodge within us? how long ſhall this preſent evil World gnaw and feed upon our Spirits, conſuming and waſting them,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:34230:108"/>
and eating out our time and ſtrength? how long <hi>ſhall</hi> the God of this World blind our Minds, and the Duſt of it fill our Eyes? how long ſhall we miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place our Affections, and miſtake our Reſt? Our Reſt is not here, our Heaven and Happineſs is not here; Earth is going from us, and we from it, and ſhall we hug what we cannot hold? Shall we kiſs and embrace that which is withering in our hands, and dying in our arms? Are there not infinitely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>better things to be minded? Duke <hi>de Alva</hi> wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly ſaid, when one told him of an Eclipſe that was then preſent, <hi>I have ſo much to do on Earth, I have no leiſure to mind Heaven.</hi> O, that it may not be ſo ſaid of any of us.</p>
                  <p>Let us call to mind what thoſe <hi>inviſible eternal things</hi> are aforementioned, as <hi>God, Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the <hi>Promiſes,</hi> the <hi>Purchaſed Inheritance,</hi> the <hi>Glory of Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> withal, let us mind Chriſt's ſecond Coming to Judgment, the manner and end of it, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. which the Apoſtle often ſpoke and wrote of, and minded, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 13, 14. the glorious Appearing of the great <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>Saviour;</hi> the Reſurrection of the Body, and the manner of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. the full Redemption and glorious Manifeſtation of the Sons of <hi>God;</hi> the happy uniting of the Souls and Bodies of the Saints after ſo long a Separation; and the uniting and ſolemn Marriage of both to Chriſt, the King of <hi>Glory;</hi> the paſſing of the Saints into <hi>Heaven</hi> with Chriſt in Triumph; their living for ever with <hi>God,</hi> ſeeing his Face, and knowing him as we are known: Oh, that we could mind theſe things, and ſet our Faith and Love, our Hopes, D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Theſe things are to be lamented:</p>

                  <p>Obj. <hi>But we do know theſe things.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>While I am writing this, my Conſcience flies in my Face, and chargeth me with guilt: <q>O par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, Lord, through the Blood of Chriſt, and give me true Repentance: Let me be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and even confounded for my woful neglect of minding inviſible eternal things: I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of my guilt, and bleſſed be God for that.

thoſe things, <hi>Who hath believed our Report? Iſa.</hi> 53. 1. <hi>and to whom is the arm of the Lord revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led?</hi> to make Souls believe, and to work effectual Faith in them? Surely to very few.</p>
                  <p>A very bare <hi>hiſtorical Faith</hi> is wanting, but much more a <hi>cordial, practical Perſwaſion</hi> of thoſe things; for by true Faith we come to have an Intereſt in <hi>all</hi> theſe eternal good things, and if we had an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in them, we ſhould mind them more.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe <hi>inviſible eternal things</hi> ſpoken of in the holy Scripture, ſignifie no more to moſt of us, than thoſe Mountains of Spices, and Mines of Gold do, that are in the <hi>Indies,</hi> which we never hope to ſee or poſſeſs, and for which none of us will part with our poor Cottages: Alas! alas! it were impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if we did <hi>really believe</hi> thoſe things above, and that they may be had by us, but that we ſhould take more pains to get a Title to them, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving once got a Title, ſurely we ſhould mind them more than we do.</p>
                  <p>Now the grand Reaſons why we that profeſs that we know and believe thoſe great things of the other World, yet take ſo <hi>little pains</hi> to be aſſured of our Right to them, are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> our <hi>falſe Faith,</hi> our <hi>falſe Hope,</hi> and our <hi>inordinate Love of the World.</hi> Cou'd we get theſe three Thieves out of our hearts, it wou'd be otherwiſe with us.</p>

                  <p n="3">III. It is Lamentable alſo, that thoſe <hi>inviſible, eternal, great</hi> and <hi>glorious things</hi> ſhould be no more minded, thought upon, conſidered, and ſpoken of by Profeſſors, that hope ſhortly to enjoy them. God, Chriſt, Glory, Heaven, are ſeldom in mens

Minds and Thoughts: What are moſt Peoples Morning and Evening Thoughts? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 11. What vain Thoughts lodge in our Hearts? <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 14. Oh, how little talk is there of theſe things amongſt us? Is God our Father? Is Chriſt our Head and Husband? Is the Holy Ghoſt our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour and Comforter? Is the Word of God our Rule and Guide, our ſpiritual Food and Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, our Comfort and Conſolation? Are the Promiſes our great Charter, Heaven and Glory our Inheritance? And do we indeed hope to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all theſe things for ever and ever, and yet think no more, and ſpeak no more of them? Can this be ſo? Can our hopes be good and well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? Let us not deceive our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. It is Lamentable, that thoſe great things ſhould be no more laboured after: <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 27. <hi>Labour not for that meat which periſheth, but for that which endureth to eternal life.</hi> Prov. 2, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 2, 3. We labour for that which is not Bread, not Bread for our Souls; and ſpend that which is better than Mony, our Spirits and Time, for that which doth not, cannot ſatisfie. Why ſhould <hi>viſible temporal things</hi> have ſo much of our hearts, heads, tongues, hands, time, ſtrength and all, and thoſe <hi>inviſible eternal things</hi> have ſo little? Is there any colour of Reaſon for it? Are not thoſe <hi>inviſible eternal things</hi> infinitely better than the other? Certainly it is, becauſe they are not known nor believed, nor minded, that they are no more laboured after.</p>
                  <p>How do we diſhonour <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Promiſes?</hi> how do we undervalue <hi>Chriſt's Purchaſe,</hi> and <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> when we lay out our ſelves ſo much for the World, and ſo little for theſe?

                  <p n="5">V. It's lamentable alſo, that the loſs of the means of the diſcovery of thoſe <hi>inviſible eternal things,</hi> ſhould no more affect and trouble us: <hi>Lam.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem remembred in the days of her affliction all her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant things, that ſhe had in the days of old.</hi> A Famine of the Word is the worſt, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This flows from the ſcope of the Text, <hi>We faint not,</hi> ſay they, but rather we gather ſtrength and courage, and <hi>our inner man is renewed day by day; while we look not at thoſe things which are ſeen, but at thoſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Looking off from viſible temporal things doth much help to ſupport God's People under their Troubles; but looking on upon inviſible eternal things doth help more.

It is the plentiful Harveſt hoped for, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that ſweetens the ſtormy Seed-time.

                     <hi>2d Reaſon</hi> is, Becauſe (as I think) the Work of Saving Faith (by which mainly we are ſupported) doth not conſiſt only in looking backward on the Croſs of Chriſt, and his payment of our Ranſom by his precious Blood; but alſo in looking for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on the Crown of Chriſt, and the Glory he hath purchaſed for us. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. <hi>Faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> Saving Faith is, not only to believe what our dear Lord hath already done on Earth for us, in the great work of Redemption; but alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly and firmly to believe thoſe things which

we never ſaw nor did ever Man ſee, and to hope and look for them ſo really, as to let go <hi>all</hi> world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Hopes and Happineſs, rather than hazard the loſs of thoſe inviſible things. This is an eminent part of Faith, whereby the Juſt do live; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
                  <p>It is upon our clear Apprehenſions and firm Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of that unſeen and eternal Felicity, in the full enjoyment of the Bleſſed God, that both our Peace and Safety doth depend.</p>
                  <p>We can have no ſolid Peace, while we look for much Comfort and Content from the Creature, in this our preſent Pilgrimage and Priſon; for in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, we looking for more in the Creature than is in it, we loſe our Comforts, and then complain for want of them; for our looking for ſo much from them, and looking ſo much on them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes God to take them from us; and when they are gone, we are troubled.</p>
                  <p>If eternal Joys, and everlaſting Conſolations were more in our Minds, if the <hi>Joy of our Lord, Matt.</hi> 25. 21. were more in our Thoughts and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, ſurely ſpiritual Joy would more at preſent abound in our Hearts: <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 13. <hi>The God of conſolation would fill us with joy and peace in believing:</hi> Believing Apprehenſions of thoſe inviſible eternal Joys, would breed in us ſome refreſhing Joys for the preſent. So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. No wonder we are ſo comfortleſs, and walk ſo ſadly, while thoſe things which ſhould raiſe us and comfort us, are ſo little in our Minds and Thoughts, and we ſuch Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers above. We muſt needs faint when we lay by our Cordials, and make no uſe of them, and when we lay by our Supports, and mind them not. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things moſt needs affect us and afflict us,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:34230:118"/>
when eternal things are out of ſight, and out of mind.</p>
                  <p>Mark this: When Chriſtians do not only let fall their expectations and hopes of the unſeen promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Glory, and let the thoughts of them decay and dye away in them; but alſo heighten their hopes and expectations from the Creature, and earneſtly and eagerly purſue the ſame; then do they moſt certainly prepare for their own Diſquiets, Fears and Troubles, and with both Hands draw Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity on themſelves, becauſe <hi>they forſake the fountain of living waters, and hew out to themſelves ciſterns, broken ciſterns, that will hold no water.</hi> All Creature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforts are at beſt but Ciſterns, and when too much loved, but broken Ciſterns, in which are no Waters of true Conſolation to be found; <hi>Jerem.</hi> 2. 13. To ſeek Content here, in any thing out of God, and beneath him, is to ſeek the Living among the Dead: The Work of Faith is, to look upwards, to look within the Veil, to look to Jeſus, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 7.</p>
                  <p>The right and ready way to preſent Peace is, looking ſtedfaſtly (not to preſent things, but) to that future Reſt and Happineſs, to the full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God in Heaven.

Whoever meets with a diſtreſſed, diſconſolate, complaining Chriſtian, you ſhall find, that one or both of theſe things is manifeſt in him; either he hath low Expectations from God hereafter, or he hath high Expectations from the Creature here; either he looks too much on things viſible and temporal, or too little on things inviſible and eternal; and indeed, he that doth the one doth the other; for, the too much minding <hi>viſible tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things,</hi> hinders the true minding of <hi>inviſible eternal things.</hi>

our Sorrows, and help much to ſupport our Spirits under <hi>all</hi> our Afflictions.</p>
                  <p>We are grieved and troubled for Loſſes and Croſſes, for loſs of Relations, for Sickneſs and Pains, Diſappointments, Unkindneſſes of Friends, Diſeſteem in the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let us conſider, whether God hath promiſed, or Chriſt purchaſed any Freedom from thoſe: Have any of the Saints been freed from thoſe?

                  <p>Nay, do we not, as it were, neceſſitate God hereby, to imbitter <hi>all</hi> our Earthly Comforts to us, and to make every Creature a Scorpion to us, becauſe we will make them our <hi>Gods?</hi> We have leſs Comfort in them than we might have, becauſe we would have more in them than we ſhould: We might have more kindneſs from Friends, more ſweetneſs in our Relations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if we looked for leſs.</p>

While we have thoſe better things in our Eye, we ſhall not be much troubled about the worſe; the better will <hi>ſwallow</hi> up the worſe, if we firmly and heartily believe them, and have good ground to hope, through Grace, that we have Title to them; as <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 25, 26. The belief of a better Reſurrection, and of a better Life than this, <hi>will</hi> ſupport us under the Troubles of this: <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 35.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then there is alſo a neceſſity lies on us of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an Intereſt in thoſe inviſible eternal good things; in God, in Chriſt, in the Promiſes, and in the Purchaſed Inheritance. An abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lies on us all, of getting an intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, Real Union with him, for only hereby we come to have an Intereſt in <hi>all</hi> thoſe eternal Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings: If Chriſt be ours, <hi>All</hi> is ours; not elſe. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22, 23.</p>
                  <p>Oh, this, this is the one thing neceſſary, That we make ſure our Intereſt in God, and in his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant by Jeſus Chriſt: This, and this alone, will <hi>ballance all our Loſſes.</hi> Take ſpecial notice of thoſe two Texts, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 6. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5.</p>
                  <p>Let us try our Intereſt in Chriſt by thoſe few Scriptures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1, 9. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit. If any man have not the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, the ſame is none of his.</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new Creature; all old things are paſt away; behold, all things are become new.</hi> Gal. 5. 24. <hi>They that are Chriſt's, have cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the fleſh with the affections and lusts thereof.</hi> Gal. 2. 20. <hi>Chriſt liveth in me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Hence we may know the true cauſe and ground of Diſcouragement and Deſpondency un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Troubles, to wit, our want of Faith in,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:34230:120"/>
and our not minding of eternal inviſible things. They that believe not the Crown, can never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably bear the Croſs: The way to forget our Miſery, is ſeriouſly and believingly to remember and conſider our Felicity. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. <hi>The ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of this life are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed in us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Burdens would not be ſo heavy as they are, if our Hearts were more heavenly than they are: If we could get more above, and converſe more with God, our Troubles would not be ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome as they are. <hi>Nil ſentit in Nervo, cum anima ſit in Coelo.</hi> Oh, let us pray for more acquaintance with God, and thereby good, all good, ſhall come unto us. Let us cry out with the Divine Poet,
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>O ſhew thy ſelf to me,</hi>

                        </l>
                     </q>
Converſe with God and Chriſt will ſweeten every bitter Cup, and lighten every heavy Burden.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Hence alſo we may inferr the Neceſſity of Patience under all our Afflictions, which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to prepare us for Glory, and that no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, than as we do by Faith and Patience live in the expectation of that Glory. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>To them, who by patient continuance in well-doing, ſeek for glory, and honour, and immortality, eternal life: Heb.</hi> 10. 36. Unleſs we patiently bear our Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, they are not like to produce thoſe bleſſed effects; it is only through Faith and Patience that we inherit the Promiſes.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Miſery of all Unbelievers then is very great, whatever they poſſe's in this World, for they muſt needs meet with Troubles alſo in this Life, and muſt meet with the King of Terrors at

laſt: And what poſſibly can ſupport them, having no intereſt in God and Chriſt, and no good grounds of hope, that they ſhall enjoy thoſe inviſible eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal good things hereafter? Part they muſt with all viſible temporal good things, and that for ever, and cannot look on God, and Glory, and Heaven as theirs, becauſe not regenerated, not united to Chriſt, not effectually called: ſurely their caſe is moſt ſad, for then alſo all their vain hopes and groundleſs confidences <hi>ſhall</hi> periſh.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The miſchief of Earthly-mindedneſs alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears hence: Inordinate minding earthly things, whether Friends or Foes, Eaſe or Pain, Loſs or Gain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this very much hinders our Comfort and Support: Oh, pray againſt it, watch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>

                  <p n="1">I. Let us look to <hi>God</hi> in all our Mercies.

It was truly ſaid of one, That <hi>many love the Creature, in oppoſition to God; Most</hi> love it in competition with him, and almoſt <hi>All</hi> love the Creature in a way of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from him. But more particularly let us labour,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:34230:123"/>
                     <hi>1st,</hi> To look unto, and acknowledge with Heart and Tongue, that our Heavenly Father in Chriſt is the Author and Giver of all the Mercies we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy. When we have Health, Eaſe, Liberty, Reſt, or any other Mercy, we ſhould look to him from whom they come, and to him through whom they come; we ſhould eye the hand of a Father, the heart and love of a Father, and conſider alſo, that all theſe Mercies come to us through the Blood of a Redeemer; this will make every morſel, every drop and crumb to be ſweet and pleaſant to us. A Dinner of green Herbs, Barley-bread, and cold Water, with the Love of God, will be ſweet.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But when ſhall we know, that we have theſe from the Love of God, and with the Love of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Then we may conclude, theſe outward Mercies come from the Love of God to us, when we are truly thankful for the leaſt Mercy we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and are ſtirred up to love God more, and to be more careful to ſerve, pleaſe, and truſt God the more.</p>
                  <p>Let us look thorough our viſible Comforts, to the inviſible giver of them, and to that eternal Love from whence they come; 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 12, 13, 16. It is our great evil, that we love the gifts of God for themſelves, and not for the giver of them: if we could ſee and taſte Divine love and goodneſs in our Relations, Health, Eſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh, how ſweet would they be unto us? But this is our Folly and Fault, we overlook and forget God, and look no further than our viſible, ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, temporal Comforts; even when we ſpeak of God with our Mouths, our Hearts are but too far from him: Our Hearts hang looſe from him, and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:34230:123"/>
lye at too great a diſtance from him; our Hearts are not engaged with Love, and Deſire, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in him, nor enlarged after him, and ſo we miſs the Comfort and Sweetneſs which we might find in him.</p>
                  <p>To delight in the God of Mercy more than in the Mercies of God, is a true Chriſtian frame, and an high pitch of Grace, and a ſpecial way of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying ſweet Communion with God; a thing wholly ſtrange to moſt, and experienced but by few.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But how ſhall I know when I do this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. By real, practical, hearty acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and owning <hi>God's</hi> Propriety in all our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Theſe Relations, Friends, this Health, Eaſe, Liberty, Safety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe are all the Lords; as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. 5. <hi>Theſe are the things that the Lord hath graciouſly given me.</hi> We ſhould always look on God as the proper owner of us and them; and all that we have, are but lent to us, and we are but Tenants at his will.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By labouring to draw up our Hearts and Loves to <hi>God,</hi> by thoſe Mercies we receive from <hi>God,</hi> to make them as Cords and Bands of Love, to draw our Hearts nearer to God, and to bind our Hearts faſter and cloſer to God by them; to make thoſe Mercies as ſteps, to raiſe up our Souls higher towards God, in all the ways of obedience and holy confidence, we ſhould pant and pray thus: <q>Oh, that this Creature-comfort may draw my Heart nearer to God, and not lye as an Idol between my Heart and God; oh, that this temporal Bleſſing may raiſe my Heart ſome degrees higher towards God; oh, that it may help me to
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:34230:124"/>
advance God more: Oh that it may not divide my Heart from God, nor make me forgetful of him, nor hinder me in my Duty to him; but, oh that every Mercy I receive from God, may endear God to me, and engage my Heart more to him.</q> Such pantings and breathings of Soul ſhould be in us, then we ſhall enjoy God in our Mercies, and then they will be ſweet unto us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By labouring to uſe and improve all our Mercies for God; our Health, Eaſe, Liberty, Eſtate and all for God; to lay <hi>all</hi> out for his Service. If we have any Talent, let it be improved for God; if any Candle of Comfort lighted in our Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let it burn for God; if any Eaſe after Pain, any Strength after Weakneſs, lay it out for God; Let us be thinking and ſtudying what uſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice we can put our Mercies to for God. Let us ſpend Time, Health, Strength, and all for God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By labouring to be <hi>willing</hi> to part with <hi>all</hi> our outward Mercies when God calls for them.</p>
                  <p>As we ſhould deſire and wiſh for no Comfort otherwiſe, than as we may have it with the love of God, and as it may help us, and not hinder us in our way to God; ſo likewiſe, we ſhould not deſire the continuance of any outward Comfort, any longer than with the Love of God; and when he is pleaſed to call for them, <hi>willingly</hi> to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them to him: This is not to love any thing above God, nor in competition with him, nor in ſeparation from him. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 14, 15. <hi>For he that loveth any thing in the world otherwiſe, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> And in ſo doing we evidence, that we love the God of Mercies more than the Mercies of God: And this way we may enjoy and maintain much ſweet communion with God here in
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:34230:124"/>
this Life; namely, by our hearty acknowledgment of God our Father in Chriſt, to be the Author of <hi>all</hi> our Mercies; looking to his Love in them; owning his Propriety in them all; making them as Cords of Love, to draw up our Hearts to God; uſing them for God, and willing to part with them at his call. This is to look to God in all our Mercies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let us labour to look unto, and live upon God, in every Creature-comfort that we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy. Not only look unto God in our Mercies, as was ſaid before in the other particular, but let us labour to aſcend higher; and that is, let us labour and learn to live upon God and his Love in thoſe Mercies.</p>
                  <p>Let this be minded by us: That it is not the Creature, but God in the Creature, that we muſt love and live upon. The Creature ſhould not content us, without ſome ſenſe of God's Love in it. If we have Health, Wealth, Liberty, Friends, we ſhould put this Queſtion to our ſelves; Do we enjoy God's Love with theſe? A great Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet ſeldom ask'd. It is ſurely the Love of God in a Mercy, that doth ſanctifie and ſweeten the Mercy to us; as is evident in that famous Inſtance of <hi>Hezekiah, Iſa.</hi> 38. 17. <hi>Thou haſt in love to my ſoul delivered me from the pit of corruption.</hi> Then Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance is ſweet, when it comes from God's Love to our Souls.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But how may we know that?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> As <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did; <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thou haſt cast all my ſins behind thy back.</hi> When Pardon of Sin comes with a Mercy, 'tis a Mercy indeed, a double Mercy. Note, When a Soul-mercy comes with a
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:34230:125"/>
Bodily Mercy, a Soul-mercy, with Eaſe, Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then that outward Mercy comes from the Love of God indeed. And thus many times our Lord Jeſus diſtributed his Mercies in the days of his Fleſh upon the Earth, healing Souls and Bodies together, forgiving their Sins, and curing their Diſeaſes all at once.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But how ſhall we know that our Sins are forgiven as well as our Trouble removed?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. When the Soul is ſtirred up to ſuitable praiſing of <hi>God,</hi> as in <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> ſo in <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 103. 1, 2, 3. the ſenſe of <hi>God</hi>'s Mercies to them enlarged their Hearts with Thankfulneſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We may know that our Sins are forgiven us, if thoſe Conditions are wrought in us, unto which forgiveneſs of Sins is promiſed, and thoſe are chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly Repentance and Faith: <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your ſins may be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out, when the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord.</hi> Acts 10. 43. <hi>To him</hi> (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to Jeſus) <hi>do all the Prophets witneſs, that through his name, whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins.</hi> Now, if after Mercies <hi>God</hi> gives us Hearts to repent and believe, we may certainly conclude that thoſe Mercies come to us from the love of <hi>God.</hi>

                  <p>We follow hard in our Prayers, and Deſires, and Endeavours after earthly Mercies, when we want them; whereas our Souls ſhould follow hard after <hi>God</hi> in them: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 8. &amp; 31. 23. In every Ordinance, Priviledge, Duty, Providence, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Enjoyment, it is the Love of God in it, that our Souls ſhould thirſt after; as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 1, 2, 3, <hi>My ſoul thirſteth for God, for the living God:</hi>

                  <p>To look through, and beyond, and above a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, unto the God of that Mercy, is a Mercy in that Mercy, and a choice one too; for none but <hi>God's Choſen ones</hi> can do it: And ſo to do, argues much Grace and much Communion with God. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1, 2. Let us look up, look up to <hi>God</hi> in <hi>all</hi> our Mercies: Stay not on the Mercy, be not content with the outward Mercy, for that is but the Shell, but look up to God, and long to ſee and taſte his Love in it, for that is the Kernel, his Love in Chriſt; feed on that by Faith, Love, Meditation.</p>
                  <p>O, let us labour to have God in all our Thoughts; for, to look to, love, and live upon Creature-comforts meerly, barely, only, is but to live upon Huſks, Aſhes, Wind and Vanity; theſe are no Bread for the Soul; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143. 6. <hi>I ſtretch forth my hands unto thee; my ſoul thirſteth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee, as a thirſty land.</hi>

                  <p>When we taſte and ſee the earthly Comforts we have, if we can alſo taſte and ſee the Love of God in them, we enjoy a double ſweetneſs, an outward and an inward, a viſible and an inviſible ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Oh, what ſweetneſs then may we taſte? for both Faith and Senſe are fed at once. And we
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:34230:126"/>
may further know, that any Mercy comes to us in Love, when our Souls are the better for that Mercy, more endeared to God, and more enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged after God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We muſt labour to uſe and enjoy <hi>all</hi> our Mercies for God, for his Honour and Service, as was hinted before.

                  <p>We ſhould judge <hi>all</hi> that good that leads us nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to God, and all that evil that draws us farther from him: <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 4. <hi>The Lord hath made all things for himſelf.</hi> We have loſt moſt of our Comforts for want of this, to wit, our not enjoying them in <hi>God,</hi> and for <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> in them: We feed on them, but not on <hi>God</hi> in them; and this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes God to remove them, and to take away our beſt outward Mercies from us; even his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, for our not uſing it, and not improving it for God, and for contenting our ſelves barely with it, without <hi>God</hi> in it: Bare Ordinances, bare Duties, without God in them, are but dry Breaſts, without Milk, which Souls may lye upon all their days, and ſtarve and periſh notwithſtanding, if they meet not God in them.</p>
                  <p>But now, if we thus eye and look unto <hi>God,</hi> and ſeriouſly mind the inviſible eternal <hi>God,</hi> we ſhall hereby be ſweetly ſupported under all our Troubles. For,</p>

                     <hi>all,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 28. This is Heavens Happineſs, to live upon that infinite Fountain of goodneſs, and to live with God. And ſo far as we can thus live upon God by Faith, Love, Meditation, Holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and Dependance, Holy Reſignation of our ſelves and all our concerns to him, ſo far we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into Heaven, and Heaven is entred into us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready: <hi>The kingdom of Heaven is within you,</hi> ſaid our Lord. And, what ſupport will this be to us in all our Afflictions!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3dly,</hi> This is the way to loſe nothing of all our Earthly Comforts; for, what we loſe in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we ſhall find in the Creator. If we enjoyed God in the Creature, in Relations, Friends, Eſtate, Liberty, Health, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we may enjoy him as well when theſe Creature-comforts are gone, and it may be better than before, for the Fountain it ſelf is purer than the Streams.</p>
                  <p>All the little good, the ſmall comfort, the ſlender and ſhort ſatisfaction, the little mixed ſweetneſs, that we have in or from any Creature, comes not from the Creature it ſelf, diſtinct from God, for then all that enjoy the Creature would have that Comfort and Content, the <hi>bad</hi> as well as the <hi>good;</hi> which we know is not ſo; for many have had large <hi>Portions</hi> of the beſt of the Creatures, that have had no comfort or contentment in them: <hi>Solomon</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is a Witneſs.</p>
                  <p>But that very little Comfort or Content that any one hath in the Creature, it is diſtilled and derived to him through the Creature from God, and from him alone. It God put ſweetneſs into any Creature-comfort, and bleſs it to us, it ſhall be ſweet to us: If He convey any goodneſs or content to us through any Creature-chanel, we ſhall have it, not elſe: But if he put bitterneſs into any Creature-comfort,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:34230:127"/>
and with-hold his Bleſſing, it will yield us no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent at all.</p>
                  <p>This is a moſt experienc'd Truth, That it is <hi>God</hi>'s Love, his Bleſſing in a Mercy, that is <hi>The Mercy;</hi> and it is that only which brings any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or Content to us that have it.</p>
                  <p>What Content had <hi>Ahab</hi> in his Kingdom, or <hi>Haman</hi> in his Honour? Surely none at all. <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 22. <hi>The bleſſing of the Lord it maketh rich, and he adds no ſorrow with it.</hi> The <hi>Bleſſing of the Lord maketh</hi> the Poor in this World <hi>rich,</hi> and with this Bleſſing <hi>comes no Sorrow,</hi> as there doth with all other Bleſſings. This is the Bleſſing that goes with <hi>The Bleſſing,</hi> the inward Bleſſing that goes with the outward Bleſſing, whether little or much, the love of <hi>God</hi> is in it to his People; and that maketh rich, that contents the Soul, and yields ſweetneſs to it; and this Contentment is the Bleſſing, without which <hi>Godlineſs</hi> it ſelf is not <hi>Gain.</hi> Now, when the outward Bleſſing is gone, the Creature-bleſſing gone, the inward Bleſſing may be continued; the Love of <hi>God,</hi> and inward Contentment may be continued; when the Cabinet is worn out, the Jewel may be as good as ever: And if this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue with us, namely, the Bleſſing which is the Love of God, if that remain towards us, when the outward Bleſſing is taken away, we have no cauſe of Diſquietment. But this remains always to the true Chriſtian; for it is <hi>God</hi>'s Covenant, which cannot be broken. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 34, 35. <hi>My loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs I will not utterly take from him, nor ſuffer my faithfulneſs to fail: My covenant will I not break,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Oh, that we could look more at the inviſible eternal Bleſſing, the ſure Mercies of <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>all</hi> our outward Bleſſings, which remains when all the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:34230:128"/>
viſible temporal things are gone. Yea, further, this inviſible everlaſting Bleſſing doth not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with us, when all other Bleſſings are gone, but (which is wonderful) then, even then, our everlaſting Father doth uſually communicate and manifeſt more of his Love (which is the Bleſſing indeed) to the Souls of his People, than when they had the enjoyment of their outward Bleſſings. When had <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>John</hi> ſuch glorious Viſions of <hi>God,</hi> but in Captivity and Exile? When <hi>God</hi> brings his People into the Wilderneſs, then he <hi>ſpeaks comfortably unto them,</hi> then he ſpeaks to their Hearts, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 14. as in the Wilderneſs, in the abſence of Creature-comforts, the Spouſe leans on her Beloved, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 5. fixeth her Loves and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires moſt intimately and heartily upon him; ſo, even then, her Beloved manifeſts moſt of his tender love to her; and when the World frowns, he ſmiles upon her.</p>
                  <p>So that this <hi>looking up to God in all our Enjoyments,</hi> living upon Him, and enjoying all in him, and for him, will wonderfully ſupport us under all our Trouble, becauſe by this means we ſhall loſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what we loſe in the Stream, we ſhall find in the Fountain; what we want in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we ſhall find in God; yea, and in all our loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for Chriſt and his Truths, we are aſſured to have an hundred fold; <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 29.</p>
                  <p>So much for the firſt Counſel, <hi>Look to God in all our Enjoyments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. The ſecond Counſel: <hi>Reſign up your wills en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to the will of God in all your Afflictions.</hi> It is an Argument of an excellent Spirit, when all Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpects are drowned in the Will of God, and there
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:34230:128"/>
is nothing loſt therein, for our beſt ſafety is in the Will of God; our Happineſs is more in God than in our ſelves, and His Will is infinitely better than ours.</p>
                  <p>We may be ſure of this, that a man ſhall never have ſetled Peace and Comfort, until he have cordially committed and reſigned up all his Will and Way, all his Concerns, and Intereſts, and Ends to the holy Will of God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 5, 7. <hi>Commit thy way unto the Lord: truſt alſo in him, and he ſhall bring it to paſs. Reſt in the Lord, and wait pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently for him.</hi> Prov. 16. 3. <hi>Commit thy works unto the Lord, and thy thoughts ſhall be eſtabliſhed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the difference of Wills, Ends, and Intereſts that begets all the Stirs and Troubles in the Hearts of Men. GOD will have his Will, and Man will have his: It is the communion of Wills, Hearts, Intereſts, and Ends, that is that <hi>fellowſhip</hi> that a Creature hath with its Creator.</p>
                  <p>It is the Intereſt and Honour, the Dignity and Duty, the Comfort and Quiet, the Heaven and Happineſs of a Rational Creature to be what God will have him be, to do what God will have him do, to want what God will have him want, and to ſuffer what God will have him ſuffer; to be <hi>wholly</hi> at the diſpoſe of God, as our Lord was; <hi>Not my will, but thine be done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is true Chriſtianity indeed, true <hi>Self-denial, Matt.</hi> 16. 24. To be no more our own, nor at our own diſpoſe, but to be entirely at the Will of God, is the way to true Comfort: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142. 5. <hi>Thou art my refuge, and my portion in the land of the living.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:34230:129"/>
Now, if we would thus look unto the inviſible God, and reſign up our wills to his will in all things, in order to our ſupport and comfort in all our Afflictions, we muſt <hi>carefully</hi> obſerve theſe things:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1st,</hi> We muſt really look unto, and heartily own God's abſolute Dominion over, and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in <hi>all</hi> things: He is the Lord and Owner of all his Works; <hi>Job</hi> 9. 12. <hi>He taketh away, who can hinder him? who durſt ſay to him, What doeſt thou?</hi> Iſa. 45. 9. He is the Potter, we are the Clay; He is the Creator of all things, and therefore the true, only, and rightful Owner of all things: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 4. <hi>All ſouls are mine,</hi> ſaith God; and all Creatures are his. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 9. And we are none of our own, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20. Whether as Creatures or Chriſtians, our Souls, Bodies, Goods, <hi>all</hi> are God's, upon <hi>all</hi> accounts: If we did not look on thoſe earthly Comforts too much as our own, we ſhould not grieve too much for the loſs of them.</p>
                  <p>Now, we own God's Dominion and Propriety in all things, when we <hi>thankfully</hi> receive any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-comfort from him, and ſilently ſubmit to his diſpoſe of them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 9. <hi>I was dumb,</hi> ſaith <hi>David;</hi> and quietly ſurrender them up to God when he calls for them; as <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2ly,</hi> We muſt really and heartily look unto and own God's Righteouſneſs in all his Diſpenſations towards us, though never ſo hard, bitter, and pinching to the Fleſh, yet God is righteous in all. <hi>By terrible things in righteouſneſs wilt thou anſwer us, O God of our ſalvation.</hi> Dan. 9. 14. <hi>Righteous art thou, O Lord.</hi> Pſal. 145. 17. <hi>The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:34230:129"/>
Now we own God's Righteouſneſs in all our Afflictions, when we diligently enquire to find out the <hi>why</hi> and the <hi>wherefore</hi> of all God's dealings with us: We ſhould reaſon thus; The righteous God afflicts me; then certainly I muſt enquire after the Cauſe, and the End: <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 40. <hi>Let us ſearch our hearts, and try our ways. God</hi> is righteous, we have deſerved this Affliction. Hereupon we muſt ſearch for our Sins, confeſs them, hate them, turn from them; and then this Conſideration ſetleth and ſatisfieth our Minds under God's cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting Hand: It is the righteous God that ſmites.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3ly,</hi> We muſt look unto and own the Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God in his Chaſtiſements of us: When He blaſts our Earthly Hopes, kills our Creature-comforts, takes away our dear Relations, deprives us of Health, Eaſe, Liberty, Name, Eſtate; yet He is faithful; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 75. <hi>In faithfulneſs thou haſt afflicted me. God</hi> hath put chaſtiſement for Sin into his Covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 31, 33. and hath promiſed to with-hold no good thing from his People, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 11. Now <hi>God</hi> ſees and knows that Chaſtiſements are good for his People, and ſhall work for their good, therefore in very faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs he doth correct them, to perform his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and fulfil his Covenant. Oh, that we could ſeriouſly look to this Faithfulneſs of God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that while He is afflicting and chaſtiſing us, He is but making good his faithful Promiſes to us, it would mightily ſupport and uphold us: But this is our Unhappineſs, that in Affliction we are apt to judge the quite contrary, and to think rather that God is executing his Threatning upon us, and that breeds Trouble to us. Little do we think,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:34230:130"/>
that when God ſtrips us of this or that outward Mercy, and lays his correcting Hand upon us, that now He is in all theſe Afflictions but perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his Promiſes to us, that He is doing us good by theſe, and accompliſhing all his ſweet, good, and gracious ends upon us; and that by theſe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions He is preparing us for that <hi>far more exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eternal weight of glory.</hi> Oh, could we but believe this, and act our Faith upon <hi>God</hi>'s Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, it would help us cheerfully to bear all our Afflictions. <hi>Lord, encreaſe our Faith.</hi>

                     <hi>4ly,</hi> We muſt look unto and own the infinite Mercy and tender Compaſſions of the inviſible eternal <hi>God,</hi> in all our Afflictions: <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Mercies,</hi> a <hi>God</hi> of tender Mercies, of tender Bowels, <hi>his Mercy endureth for ever;</hi> His tender Mercies are over all his Works, and much more over his ſpecial Workmanſhip, his own Children, whom He hath begotten and formed for himſelf: He is <hi>gracious and merciful, Exod.</hi> 34. 6, 7.

There is no revengeful Paſſion in the moſt holy God; it is He that puts Bowels of Mercy and Compaſſion into his Creatures, and then ſurely He is full of Mercy himſelf: He is <hi>rich in mercy,</hi> and of <hi>great love, Epheſ.</hi> 2. 4. and full of Mercy. <hi>The Lord taketh pleaſure in them that fear him, in them that hope in his mercy, Pſal.</hi> 147. 11. <hi>Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him; upon them that hope in his Mercy;</hi> Pſal. 33. 18.

                     <hi>5ly,</hi> We muſt look unto and own the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency and All-ſufficiency of the inviſible eternal <hi>God, Gen.</hi> 17. 1. <hi>I am the almighty God,</hi> Rev. 1. 8.

He hath infinite ways of his own for helping us, either immediately from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or by raiſing up other means (and thoſe it may be very unlikely, yea, contrary) to deliver us. God is moſt honoured by us when we ſee nothing, but rather all contrary to that we look for, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge failing, Friends, Fleſh, Heart failing, then, to ſhut our Eyes to all Creature-helps, and look altogether on <hi>God's All-ſufficiency,</hi> and only relye on that.

                  <p>This our eying and owning God's Almightineſs and All-ſufficiency, will work in us an <hi>holy awe</hi> and <hi>filial fear</hi> of Him: Who would not fear ſuch a God? <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 5.

                  <p>This is the beſt way to glorifie <hi>God</hi> in the day of our Viſitation; to truſt in him, and relye upon him; though He kill <hi>all</hi> our Comforts, yet to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve He can ſupply He can provide; as ſaid <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. 33, 35.

For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>God</hi> knows beſt how to order our Afflictions to us, and that (1.) as to Time, when to ſend them; (2.) as to Kind, what ſort of Affliction to ſend; (3.) as to Meaſure, how much to ſend; (4.) as to Duration, how long to continue them: <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10. and to what end and purpoſe. He is a moſt wiſe God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He knows beſt how to ſupport and comfort his People under <hi>all</hi> their Afflictions, and when to comfort them; He knows their Frame; He knows their Souls in Adverſity; He knows their Need and their Strength; and hath regard to all this. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>He is the God of all conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>7ly,</hi> and laſtly, Let us eye and own the love and goodneſs of God in <hi>all</hi> our Afflictions: We are apt to look moſtly to the Anger and Diſpleaſure of God in our Troubles, which indeed we ought to be ſenſible of, and deeply affected with, becauſe we have ſinned againſt Him, and therefore ought we patiently to bear the effects of his indignation, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 9. and to humble our ſelves under his mighty Hand, to <hi>repent of,</hi> and <hi>turn from our evill</hi>

                     <hi>ways, Lam.</hi> 3. 40. This we muſt do, but this is not <hi>all</hi> our Duty; but we muſt alſo look up to the love of God, and to his goodneſs, from which our Afflictions come; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 6. <hi>Whom the Lord loveth he chaſtneth:</hi> Pſal. 25. 10. <hi>All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For, as our Afflictions have a bad Cauſe, as bad as may be, even our Sins. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. <hi>Wherefore doth the living man complain, a man for the puniſhment of his ſins?</hi> Yet they proceed from a good Root, even the Love of God: <hi>As many as I love, I rebuke and chaſten,</hi> ſaith our loving Lord Jeſus, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 19. He loves when he takes, as well as when he gives. He takes in love; and this believed and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, will very much ſweeten every bitter Cup: The believing conſideration, that the love of our Father, the love of the Mediator is in every Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; that every Cup that comes to us, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth firſt through his Hands, who loved us, and gave himſelf for us, (for through him are <hi>all</hi> things) this conſideration will ſupport us: <hi>Lord, encreaſe our Faith.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. The laſt Counſel to Chriſtians, in order to their ſupport and comfort in their Afflictions, is this:</p>
                  <p>Aim at <hi>Communion with God,</hi> and <hi>Conformity to him in all your Actions:</hi> Look unto the inviſible eternal God, and labour for Communion with him, and conformity to him. It is conformity to God that fits us for communion with him. The more conformity to him, to his holy Nature, and to
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:34230:132"/>
his holy Will, the more communion we ſhall have with him; and the more we are like him, the more will he manifeſt himſelf unto us; and the more we obey him, the more fellowſhip we ſhall have with him. <hi>John</hi> 14. 21, 23.</p>
                  <p>And alſo, the more communion we have with him, &amp; the more communications we have from him, the more conformable we ſhall be to him, and the more we ſhall be like him; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God will transform and change us into his Image more and more; and the more we have of his Image, the more pleaſure will he take in us, and the more delight will he take to communicate himſelf to us: The more holy, heavenly, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, meek, patient, loving, merciful, peaceable we are, the more like him we are; and the more we are like him, the more of his <hi>love</hi> and <hi>likeneſs</hi> will he continually work in us, and manifeſt unto us. This is the Life of true Religion; this is to live the Life of <hi>God,</hi> to live in communion with him, pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and longing after conſtant Influences and Communications of his Life, Spirit, Love, Grace, Peace, and Comfort from him; and giving up, ſurrendring up of our <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Souls</hi> to him, ſpending our beſt thoughts, deſires, affections, hopes, truſt, joy, and delight upon him.</p>
                  <p>Always minding, that it is God in Chriſt that we muſt thus look unto and mind, in <hi>all</hi> theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; God in Chriſt, not God ſingly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for, <hi>God</hi> cannot be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably thought upon out of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Mediator, in <hi>whom alone he is well pleaſed:</hi> No Communion with <hi>God,</hi> but in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> no Communication of any good from <hi>God</hi> to <hi>us,</hi> but in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and by his Spirit. It is the inviſible eternal God by the inviſible
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:34230:133"/>
eternal Son of <hi>God,</hi> and through the inviſible eternal Spirit, that we muſt make <hi>all</hi> our Addreſſes unto, and expect <hi>all</hi> Communications of good from.</p>
                  <p>It is <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone that muſt bring <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Soul</hi> together: In <hi>Chriſt</hi> we are reconciled to him, even by the Blood of his Croſs; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21. And being reconciled to <hi>God</hi> by him, we have Peace with <hi>God,</hi> and then have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him.</p>
                  <p>In Chriſt, <hi>God</hi>'s Nature becomes lovely to us, and ours to <hi>God,</hi> otherwiſe there is an utter Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty betwixt his pure and our impure Nature. <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath made up the vaſt gulf between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>us; He drank of the brook in the way, Pſal.</hi> 110. laſt.</p>
                  <p>Aim at, and thirſt after Communion with <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in all your receipts of Mercies from him, and in all your returns of Duty to him: Pray and pant, that all that you receive from him may come to you from his Love in Chriſt. Oh, that this Mercy, that this Affliction, may proceed from God's Fatherly Love in Chriſt Jeſus! ſo in all your Approaches to God, in Ordinances and Duties, pray and pant after Communion with God in Chriſt; Oh, that I may meet with God in this Ordinance, and in this Duty! without which we ſhould not be ſatisfied in any.</p>
                  <p>Ordinances and Duties, and all outward Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, are but viſible temporal things; we muſt look beyond them and above them, unto God in Chriſt, for the inviſible eternal love, and grace, and bleſſing of God in them. So holy <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 63. 1, 2, 3. <hi>That I may ſee thy power and thy glory,</hi> ſaith he. And Verſ. 8. <hi>My ſoul followeth hard</hi>
                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:34230:133"/>
                     <hi>after</hi> God; to ſee God's power, and love, and grace in Ordinances. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 1, 2. <hi>My ſoul thirſteth for God, for the living God.</hi> This is the marrow and fatneſs of God's Ordinances, and this is that will ſatisfie the Soul; therefore this is the thing that our Souls ſhould long and breath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that we may have ſights, ſweet ſights of the inviſible eternal God in Chriſt, in Ordinances and Duties, and taſts of his love and goodneſs in them.</p>
                  <p>And if we have Communion with God in our Mercies, we <hi>ſhall</hi> be able <hi>thankfully</hi> to receive them and <hi>fruitfully</hi> to improve them for God: And alſo, we ſhall be enabled patiently and comfortably to bear <hi>all</hi> our Afflictions, and profitably to improve them.</p>
                  <p>Now, if we would have Communion with God in Chriſt, we muſt look well to theſe things, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1st,</hi> We muſt <hi>labour to be pure in Heart,</hi> for ſuch as are pure in Heart, and <hi>they only, ſhall ſee God;</hi> God in his Son, God in his Ordinances, in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, and in Glory at laſt. If we regard Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in our Hearts, God will not hear our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, nor afford us any Communion with him. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 8. A pure Heart is a new Heart, an Heart purged by the Blood of Chriſt from the guilt of Sin, and purified by his Spirit; <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 9. An Heart renewed and ſanctified; a ſingle, ſincere, and upright Heart, that hath pure Principles planted in it, the Spirit of God, the Fear of God, the Love of God, Faith in God and Chriſt, Chriſt formed there, the Image of God ſtamped there, the Kingdom of God ſet up there: Theſe are the true Principles of Purity of Heart and Life; and alſo an Heart ſet and bent by the Rules of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:34230:134"/>
God's pure Word, that pure Rule; and that acteth for pure ends to pleaſe God, to bring Glory to him, to do good to others, and to enjoy God in our Salvation: Such may expect ſweet Communion with God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16, 17. the Lord God Almighty <hi>will walk and dwell with ſuch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2ly,</hi> We muſt labour to be poor in Heart, poor in Spirit, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 3. broken in Heart, contrite in Spirit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 15. O, the wonderful condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the high and lofty one, who dwelleth in the Heavens! that He ſhould ſtoop ſo low, as to dwell in the broken Heart, to revive ſuch Hearts, ſuch Spirits; O, the Revivings of God, they are Soul-ſatisfying things: The Conſolations of God are not ſmall: Happy indeed are thoſe Souls in whom the great and glorious God dwells; Bleſſed Souls that are the Temple of the holy God, Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of God by the Spirit; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 22. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 2. To the man will God look that is poor, and of a contrite Spirit; and God's looks on ſuch are ſweet looks, Love-looks; ſuch ſhall have much communion with God and Chriſt, for Chriſt was ſent to bind up the <hi>broken hearted, Luke</hi> 4. 18.</p>
                  <p>What a comfortable ſupport is this to a poor afflicted Chriſtian, that is poor in this World, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of Friends and earthly Comforts, reſtrained and ſhut up in Priſon, or otherwiſe confined to Chamber or Sick-bed, and withal, is <hi>poor in Spirit,</hi> is content in this condition? Yet now, in this his deſolate condition, he may have Communion with the great God; he may enjoy the bleſſed and ſweet Company of the Lord Jeſus by day and by night, even when Lover and Friend is put far from him; even then his God is near him, his everlaſting Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

God hates <hi>Hypocriſie:</hi> Oh, the guile and falſhood of our hearts, let us bewail it, and cry to God with <hi>David, Make my heart ſound in thy statutes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>4ly,</hi> Be heavenly in heart, be heavenly-minded; ſuch ſhall have ſweet Communion with <hi>God;</hi> ſuch as have their <hi>Converſation in Heaven,</hi> have converſe with God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20. We muſt be very watchful, that the World do not lye too near our hearts, nor lodge too long in our hearts, for that will ſteal away our hearts from God, and hinder our Communion with him: We muſt take heed, that our hearts be not at any time over-charged with the Cares of this Life, but let us labour to keep the <hi>World</hi> and our <hi>Hearts</hi> aſunder; for thoſe things that are viſible and temporal, will darken our ſight of God, if we let them into our hearts; and they will drive God out of our hearts,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:34230:135"/>
if we entertain the inordinate love of them.</p>
                  <p>Covetouſneſs is Idolatry, becauſe it ſets up the Creature for a God in the Heart; 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 14, 15. <hi>He that loveth the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> Keep a ſtrong Watch then againſt this preſent evil World, and ſuffer it not to get into your Hearts, if you will maintain your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>5ly,</hi> Be much in the acting of Faith, Love, Hope, Joy in the Lord: Be much in praiſing <hi>God:</hi> By the exerciſes of theſe graces we enjoy <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> communicates himſelf to us. Oh, labour to live in the lively exerciſe of Faith: Chriſt dwells in the Heart by Faith; <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. Labour to believe the Love of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> to your Souls, in giving his Son to be a Sin-offering for us: <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. And this believing it will warm and enflame your Hearts with Love to God again, and ſo you may enjoy much ſweet Communion with <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt; John</hi> 14. 21, 23.</p>
                  <p>In the Actings of our Love to <hi>God</hi> we ſhall meet with more Manifeſtations of <hi>God's</hi> Love to us. Where and when we open our Hearts to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and give them our Loves, there and then will <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> open their Hearts to us, and give us their Loves; <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 2, 3. &amp; <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. 10, 11. There is a mutual Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Love to each other; no Love is loſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and his Spouſe: <hi>If any man open to me,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>I will come in unto him, and ſup with him, and he with me; Rev.</hi> 3. 18. Now, by the exerciſe of Faith and Love, we open to Chriſt; he is always ready to come in: <hi>Open your everlaſting doors, that the king of glory may come in,</hi> Pſ. 24.</p>

                     <hi>6ly,</hi> Be very watchful: Watch, and <hi>keep your hearts with all diligence, Prov.</hi> 4. 23. Take heed; let not the World nor Vain Thoughts lodge there. Take heed of wandring from <hi>God;</hi> watch your words, watch your ſteps; take heed, grieve not, quench not, reſiſt not the Holy Spirit, for by him <hi>God</hi> communicates himſelf to your Souls; carefully obſerve all his Motions, and ſtill beg his aſſiſtance in all your Duties, and reſt upon his Aid, without which you can do nothing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>7ly,</hi> And laſtly, If we would maintain our Communion with God, (which is our <hi>Heaven upon Earth)</hi> we muſt look well to our whole Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that that be ordered aright, for to ſuch <hi>God will ſhew his ſalvation,</hi> Pſal. 50. 23. <hi>God</hi> looks for a well-order'd Converſation, a Life order'd by the Rule of his Word, ſetting narrow Steps to our Feet, looking ſtraight on, <hi>not turning aſide to the right or left hand,</hi> Prov. 4. 25, 26, 27. nor <hi>wickedly departing from his way,</hi> Pſal. 18. 21, 22, 23. but to be righteons, juſt, honeſt, ſaithful, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, charitable in all our dealings with Men, and carefully performing all our Duties to GOD and Man in ſingleneſs and integrity of Heart. This is a well-order'd Converſation.</p>
                  <p>Alſo, in our Converſation, we muſt mind two things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we have no fellowſhip with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful Works of Darkneſs, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 11. that is, no more than need; no intimate Familiarity and Communion with them, leſt thereby we loſe our Communion with God; no more Communion with the Wicked than Piety, Charity, and
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:34230:136"/>
Neceſſity will allow. Too many have loſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with GOD, by their too intimate Communion with the Wicked. <hi>Away from me,</hi> ſaith holy <hi>David, all ye workers of iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That we break not Fellowſhip with, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw Communion from the People of God, from thoſe that bear his Image, although differing from us in ſome circumſtances. In the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints we may have Communion with God; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 2. God is among his People, he walks in them, and dwells in them. Our Love muſt be not only to thoſe of our own Opinion, but to all Saints and profeſſing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and muſt hold Communion with all thoſe with whom we may charitably judge, that Chriſt holds Communion; were this well minded, it would do much to heal our ſad and ſinful Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 24, 25.</p>
                  <p>And thus we have ſeen, how that our looking unto inviſible eternal things, eſpecially unto God in Chriſt, and maintaining our Communion with them, we may be ſweetly born up, and comfortably ſupported under all our Troubles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O Moſt holy, moſt merciful, moſt gracious Lord God, Father Almighty, and my moſt loving and tender-hearted Father in my moſt dear and ſweet Redeemer Jeſus Chriſt; I render Thee my moſt humble and hearty Thanks and Praiſe, for length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>

               <p>The Reverend Author having preached many profitable Sermons on the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Examine your ſelves, whether you be in the Faith, &amp;c.</hi> in which he induſtriouſly and clearly ſhewed the neceſſity of Self-examination, the nature of the Duty conſiſting in a ſecret Debate of our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal eſtate and conditions within our own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms, wherein the Mind of a man ponders and weighs all that makes for him or againſt him, in an even Ballance. The Object-matter of this Debate is things eternal, the eternal concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:34230:138"/>
of his Soul, as likewiſe the manner of the performance of this Duty, with greateſt ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſolemnity ſetting the perfect Law of <hi>God</hi> before us, and humbly imploring the ſpecial Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Holy Spirit. Men are to debate theſe two things; <hi>1ſt,</hi> Whether they are in Chriſt, or in the ſtate of Nature: a great Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion indeed, upon which hang all our Hopes of Heaven, <hi>Chriſt in you the hope of glory, Col.</hi> 1. 27. <hi>2dly,</hi> If we be in Chriſt, what condition we are in, whether thriving in Grace, or decaying. In the firſt of theſe Queſtions the painful Author ſpent many Exerciſes in the reſolving of, in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down, opening and anſwering eight ſeveral diſtinct Rules of Tryal of a Saving Intereſt in Chriſt, with the ſeveral Objections that poor doubting Souls might make againſt themſelves; things highly worth the publication, as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by ſome imperfect Notes taken from him, which, becauſe I cannot attain to a more exact Copy of them, I muſt omit them, the more is the pity: But for the ninth and laſt Mark, I find more full and perfect, and therefore only offer this one to your conſideration, concerning which hear his own words.</p>
               <p>As to this ninth Mark, of a Saving Intereſt in Chriſt, I have this to ſay, That if the Lord ſhall clear but this one Tryal, I do not value what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Objections you have againſt any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: This will undoubtedly ſpeak your Souls Intereſt in the Lord Jeſus, without any more ado; and as far as the Lord ſhall clear it to you, you may venture your Souls into Eternity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:34230:139"/>
And therefore try your ſelves by this, if any of you be ſincerely and fully reſolved upon full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of your ſinful and miſerable ſtate by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the anſwerableneſs of Chriſt to all your Wants; to let go all that hinders the enjoyment of him, and embrace all that furthers the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him. You need not make any Doubt or Queſtion after this, Whether Chriſt be yours, or you be his: Conſent is eſſential to Marriage; there can be no Spiritual Marriage to Chriſt, but by conſent of the Will. Knowledge is eſſential to Conſent; he that doth not think and know, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſent. If you be therefore conſenting and willing to be Chriſt's upon his own terms, there remains no Doubt whether Chriſt be yours after that Conſent. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Thou ſhalt be for me, ſo alſo will I be for thee.</hi> Chriſt is for vou if you be for him: And when the great Work of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is expreſt in Scripture, you find it expreſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Act of the Wills Conſent, in the 110th <hi>Pſalm</hi> 3. <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holineſs, from the womb of the morning: thou haſt the dew of thy youth.</hi> That is, of thy Spiritual Off-ſpring; and this is brought about by conſenting to take Chriſt upon his own terms. But Beloved, don't miſtake your ſelves, I am not about to ſhuffle over ſo great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment as this is raſhly; I am well aware my own and your Salvation too is carried in the matter I am to diſcourſe, and therefore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, in the Strength of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially faithful between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>us,</hi> in this great matter. I would not for ten thouſand Worlds a word ſhould drop from my Lips, to the ruine of
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:34230:139"/>
any Soul, nor yet to diſturb the Peace of any gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soul, and therefore let me explain what I have to ſay clearly. There are three things of abſolute neceſſity for the gaining of a ſolid Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptural Intereſt in Chriſt, the two firſt I hope will paſs current with moſt of us, yet ſome may ſtumble there.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is this: There muſt of neceſſity be a full and ſerious conviction of Sin and Miſery without Chriſt; there's not a Soul that comes to him without ſuch a conviction: The Spirit, when he cometh, he ſhall convince the World of Sin and of Righteouſneſs, <hi>John</hi> 16. 9. that's the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit's firſt Work, and 'tis fundamental to all his After-works: And therefore you ſhall find in all the Converts in Scripture, the Lord has been deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their Underſtandings firſt, to convince them of their ſinful and miſerable ſtate by nature. And the Lord Jeſus profeſſedly tells us, <hi>He came not to call the righteous, but ſinners, to repentance.</hi> Convinced Sinners, not thoſe that think they have Righteouſneſs of their own; and that the whole have no need of a Phyſician, but they that are ſick: And it muſt needs be ſo, that Chriſt muſt take his courſe, becauſe his Commiſſion leads to it; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1, 2. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, becauſe he hath ſent me to preach glad tydings to the meek, to bind up the broken in heart, and proclaim liberty to the captives.</hi> Theſe are the perſons upon whom Chriſt is to act the great work of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they are ſaid to be ſuch as are bound with the ſence of Sin, ſuch as are broken hearted through the ſence of their Sin and Miſery: And when he invites Men and Women to come to him,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:34230:140"/>
ſee how he doth it, in the 11. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>Come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me all that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you reſt:</hi> Theſe are the perſons Chriſt beſtows himſelf upon. So that there muſt be ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of Sin and Miſery by Nature, as leaves us without Hope, without Chriſt. I don't ſpeak of the degrees of ſpiritual Trouble, but I take this to be an unqueſtionable Truth, that ſo much Conviction as unbottoms the Soul from Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs and Falſe hopes, is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; and before this is, there can be no Match between Chriſt and the Soul. If any man be married to his own Righteouſneſs, Duties, and Performances, that Soul hath nothing to do at all with Chriſt; nor can that Soul be married to Chriſt, for 'tis married to the Law, another Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; as you may ſee in the Sixth of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Apoſtle in that Chapter proves to us, that we can have nothing to do with Chriſt until we are divorced from our own Self-righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. That's the firſt thing, and this, I hope, the Lord hath wrought upon many that are here before him: The Spirit of Illumination hath been upon us, ſhewing us what miſerable Wretches we were, and ſtruck down the Foundation upon which our Hopes were built before.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſecond thing that is to paſs upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Soul, in order to his Union with Chriſt, is a full Conviction of the Anſwerableneſs and Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is in Jeſus Chriſt, to all the wants and ſpiritual neceſſities of the Soul. This you muſt ſee, or you will never conſent to take Chriſt for your Lord: <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Neither is there ſalvation in any other, for there is none other name given under</hi>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:34230:140"/>
                  <hi>Heaven, whereby we may be ſaved.</hi> Here's your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge; Chriſt, and none but Chriſt, can anſwer the Neceſſities of my poor Soul. I am full of Guilt, and there is no Righteouſneſs but in Chriſt to juſtifie me; I am full of Filth, and there is no Holineſs but in Chriſt to ſanctifie me. To this Refuge therefore in Chriſt, God ſhuts up every Soul as to his laſt Hopes: Therefore you find in the 3d of <hi>Galat.</hi> 23. we are ſaid to be <hi>ſhut up unto the Faith:</hi> So that we ſee no other way in the World to eſcape Hell, but at this Door, the Lord Jeſus. This alſo, I truſt, the Lord hath made evident to ſo many Souls of you as are in Chriſt. You ſee your abſolute need of him, and you ſee in Chriſt a compleat fulneſs to anſwer all the wants of your Souls; that you are ſhut up to him, and have not the leaſt hopes hanging upon any other Object beſides Chriſt. Well, that's the ſecond thing.</p>
               <p n="3">III. To come to the main, for all theſe are but previous Works, and may ſignifie ſomething or nothing; the third thing that gives an Intereſt in Chriſt, is a deliberate Conſent to part with all things that hinders the enjoyment of him, and to embrace all things that promote and further the enjoyment of the Lord Jeſus. Such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as this is, will put your Salvation quite out of doubt, if there be any in the World, in Chriſt, 'tis the Soul that deliberately conſents. Now therefore to open this, remember,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, That here muſt be a deliberate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; it is not a Work to be done <hi>Hand over Head,</hi> as we ſay, raſhly, and ſo to repent afterwards,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:34230:141"/>
to retreat, and call back our Conſent afterwards; when we ſhall meet with ſomething in Religion that we did not look for, there muſt be a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration of the Will. There be many men that hang between willing and unwilling, they do and they do not conſent: In ſome things they can, and in other things they cannot come up to the terms of the Goſpel, when the Mind and Judgment of a poor Chriſtian hangs in a doubtful ſuſpence. I would, and I would not; This I could cloſe with, and That I cannot: Here's the undoing of Men. And this was the caſe of <hi>Agrippa, Almoſt thou perſwadeſt me to be a Chriſtian.</hi> I could go a great way to be a Chriſtian, but I cannot come off roundly to all the Terms of Jeſus Chriſt: What ſhall we do in ſuch a caſe as this is? Thy Soul ſees Sin and Miſery upon one ſide, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon the other ſide; willing thou art to ſuffer a little for him, but there be ſome things in Religion they cannot come up to. Now if a Man will be a thorough <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> he muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate the Terms, and heartily reſolve to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace all the Terms of the Goſpel, that are made neceſſary to his Salvation by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> it muſt be a thorough Reſolution, expreſt in the 119th Pſalm, <hi>I have ſworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.</hi> And this is called, <hi>a count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Coſt.</hi> Such a <hi>Conſent</hi> as this is abſolutely neceſſary; and the want of this is the cauſe of ſo many Half-chriſtians, which is called, a <hi>Cake not turn'd;</hi> which doth but make Hypocrites in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. That's the firſt thing in <hi>Conſent,</hi> Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Judgment, pondering the Terms of <hi>Chriſt</hi> throughly.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:34230:141"/>
2. The ſecond thing in this <hi>Conſent</hi> is, that a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> muſt heartily reſolve to let go all thoſe things that hinder the enjoyment of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and bleſſed be he of the Lord, whoſe will is brought to this, that there is nothing ſo dear in the World, but he is reſolved it ſhall go; for I muſt tell you, Brethren, there be ſome things of which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>If ye ſeek me, let theſe go their way.</hi> So if you ſeek <hi>Chriſt,</hi> there be ſome things that muſt go, and ſome things that may go. Now, thoſe things that are to be parted with in order to the enjoyment of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are of two ſorts, firſt, ſome things are abſolutely neceſſary to be caſt off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more ado; and there are ſome things conditionally neceſſary to be parted with; that is, if God's Glory, Truth, and Honour require our parting with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> To begin with the firſt, there are ſome things abſolutely neceſſary to be renounced with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>Conditions;</hi> there muſt be no Scruple as to theſe things; and they are ſuch as theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Firſt of all, Sinful Self, and all beloved Luſts of our Hearts and Natures: Theſe muſt be renounced, or we can have nothing to do with <hi>Chriſt:</hi> The profitable and pleaſant Sins, that are as right Hands and right Eyes, you muſt part with them, <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> if you will have <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Sin</hi> cannot reign together. Pray look into <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 19, 20, 21. and you ſhall ſee the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of this; <hi>As you have yielded your members ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to uncleanneſs,</hi> ſo <hi>now yield them up</hi> to God, as Inſtruments of Righteouſneſs, <hi>unto holineſs.</hi> You
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:34230:142"/>
ſee the abſolute neceſſity of giving Sin a diſcharg from all further Obedience, or elſe we cannot be the Servants of the Lord Jeſus. <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> I do not ſay, when thou receiveſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> thou ſhalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver commit a Sin more; no, no, but that which I mean is this, That thou muſt from henceforth provide for Sin no more, indulge Sin by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Will no more; you muſt not continue the actings of it deliberately; you muſt hate every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alſe way, and the conſent of your Wills muſt be to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> that's the firſt thing to be let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or you cannot have an intereſt in the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The ſecond thing that is abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be renounced and parted with, in order to an <hi>Intereſt in Chriſt,</hi> is all our own Self-righteouſneſs; you muſt let that go too, elſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> and you will never agree: That Idol muſt down, Self-righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs muſt be univerſally and heartily renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and abhorred. 'Tis plain from <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 9. <hi>Yea doubtleſs, and I count all things but loſs for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord: for whom I have ſuffered the loſs of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Chriſt, and be found in him, not having my own righteouſneſs.</hi> You ſee Self-righteouſneſs muſt go to the Dunghil, all our own Duties muſt be renounced, all natural and acquired gifts muſt be renounced, never to look at Self in whole or in part, in point of <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;</hi> if you do, you can have nothing to do with the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt; Rom.</hi> 10. 3. the <hi>Jews</hi> being ignorant of God's Righteouſneſs, went about to <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> their own Righteouſneſs. Here you ſee a perfect oppoſition between a Man's <hi>eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing</hi>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:34230:142"/>
his own Righteouſneſs, and getting an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Chriſt. Friends, you muſt not think of two Righteouſneſſes, one in Chriſt, and another in your ſelves: <hi>I will make mention of thy righteouſneſs, even of thine only.</hi> Down with all Self-righteouſneſs, or you can have nothing to do with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) The third thing that is to be let go for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, are all Companions in Sin: How much Delight ſoever you have formerly had in them, you muſt henceforth make them no more your delightful choſen Aſſociates. Here's the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Point between wicked Men and the Saints of Jeſus Chriſt. I don't ſpeak of Civil Commerce, as Men in the World, there we muſt have to do with wicked Men, but I ſpeak of choſen delightful Companions in Sin, when 'tis an Act of the Will; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 3, 4. <hi>Wherein they</hi> wonder <hi>that ye run not with them to the ſame exceſs of riot, ſpeaking evil of you.</hi> Ay, here's the breach made, when we come to Chriſt, between us and the wicked World; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. 4.—and ſo you ſhall find in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 63. <hi>I am a companion of all them that fear thee.</hi> Beloved, Chriſt requires you to caſt off the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful company of wicked ones; Chriſtians are a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of themſelves, and none but ſuch ſhould be choſen: <hi>All my delight is in the Saints,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi> Whatever Tyes there be, unleſs it be thoſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and civil Relations, they muſt not tye us to wicked men, but we muſt be the Companions of the Servants of Chriſt, if we will have Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are ſome things that may be let go, or may not; that is according as God calls, or calls not for them: If the Glory of God ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:34230:143"/>
it, then we are to part with them; and theſe are all Earthly Comforts, if ſo be they come to be inconſiſtent with the Truths or Glory of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> rather than deny the Truths of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> when his Glory or Enjoyment comes in competition, then <hi>Chriſt</hi> requires us to part with them. Such are our eſtates, when the Glory of the Lord Jeſus ſhall call us to deny them, as the believing <hi>Hebrews</hi> were. Such are our Liberty, when we cannot keep it without the eclipſing the Honour of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus: Yea, ſuch is alſo our natural Life, if that be laid in ballance with the Truths of Chriſt. He would not have his People reckon their Lives dear upon his account; either I muſt deny the known Truth, or my Liberty, Life, or Eſtate muſt go: And now, if any of theſe come in competiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt, they muſt all go: <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 33. <hi>Whoſoever he be of you, that forſaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> This includes Eſtate, Liberty, and Life, Now, here is the ſtick in the caſe, How far a poor Soul can come up to <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Terms, upon this Conditional Neceſſity. I do not doubt, but there be many Souls in <hi>Chriſt</hi> that have many Fears about it, what their Heart will do; many ſhaking Fears what they will do in an hour of Temptation; yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of their Hearts, that <hi>all ſhall go;</hi> they will forſake Father, Mother, Wife, Children. <q>Why, Lord, ſaith a poor Chriſtian, if I cannot enjoy theſe without the deſtruction of my poor Soul; in thy Strength I reſolve to follow thee in the deepeſt paths of Self-denyal, to the laſt breath.</q> And without this you cannot be Chriſt's Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:34230:143"/>
My Friends, the Lord Jeſus hath ſet down the Terms, and he will not come lower, and if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come up to his Terms, Chriſt and you muſt part, he will not come down for the ſake of any man; therefore conſider of thoſe things. Now, he that is contented to part with <hi>all,</hi> rather than part with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that <hi>Soul</hi> is for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> is for that Soul. But there is the laſt thing, and that is, the embracing of all thoſe things that may help you to enjoy <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Theſe are deep tryals of the Heart, and therefore it concerns us to make deep ſearches here. Well then, there be four things that do further a man's Soul in the way to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and are you contented, and that deliberately, <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to embrace them all to help you to <hi>Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Are you contented to embrace and welcome all the Ordinances of God and Duties of Religion, both publick and private, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of one of them? Can you turn your feet to all his Ordinances? I know ſome <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have a Zeal for ſome Duties, and not for others; but publick and private Duties, Heart-duties, and Life-duties, all that have the Stamp of <hi>Chriſt's Inſtitution</hi> upon them, muſt be embraced; as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 6. <hi>Then ſhall I not be aſhamed, when I have reſpect unto all thy commandments.</hi> When you dare not neglect a Duty, but bring a ſerious Heart to every Duty, if you be <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s, you muſt come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law of his Houſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Are you contented to embrace all Fatherly Corrections from the hand of God, for the killing of the Remainders of Sin in you? If
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:34230:144"/>
you will be for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> you muſt ſubmit to <hi>Chriſi</hi>'s Method: It is in vain to ſay, If I can travel to Heaven without meeting a Storm in the way, I am willing to go; thou muſt be contented with all Afflictions, to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>Paul</hi> could ſay, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>Therefore I take pleaſure in infirmities, in perſecutions, for Chriſt's ſake, for when I am weak, then am I ſtrong.</hi> Ay, that was a high frame; I will not ſtrain up your Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to <hi>Paul</hi>'s; But, can you conſent to endure them? Can you bear a Rod from God when it is to purge your Corruptions? Can you bear a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution from God, without ſtarting from your Duty?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If you will be <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s, you muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to all thoſe means <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath appointed, for the mortification of your <hi>Corruptions,</hi> be they never ſo hard, Rebukes from GOD, Rebukes from Men, by Afflictions, and by the Word, for the mortification of Sin? Can you ſay, <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that you are willing to have your <hi>Miſtakes</hi> detected by GOD or Men, your <hi>Corruptions</hi> diſcovered, any thing that helps to the pulling up the Roots of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption?</hi> Surely thus it <hi>muſt</hi> be, if you will be for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> all faithful Admonitions, all neceſſary Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and laſtly, If you will be for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and be his, you muſt embrace all pains, watchings, and labourings after Holineſs, to the end of your days: Holineſs will coſt a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> abundance of Labour, but this you muſt do, or you cannot be <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. <hi>Having theſe promiſes, let us cleanſe ourſelves from all ſilthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit,</hi>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:34230:144"/>
                  <hi>perfecting holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> Here's the Work of a <hi>Chriſtian, cleanſing Work</hi> and <hi>perfecting Work in the fear of God,</hi> to the end of our Lives. You muſt take the pains that other <hi>Chriſtians</hi> do if you will have <hi>Chriſt</hi> for your Portion. Now mark what I ſay: He that is willing to part with all that hinders the enjoyment of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as ſinful Self and righteous Self; and he that reſolves to embrace all things that may help him forward to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as all the Ordinances of <hi>God,</hi> all Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly correction from the hand of <hi>God,</hi> all means of mortification from <hi>GOD</hi> or Men, and all pains for Holineſs; he that is contented with theſe terms is as ſurely <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s as ever was any Soul. I have not made the terms in one point higher than <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath made them.</p>
               <p>And thus I have ſhewed you <hi>Chriſtians</hi> what the Terms are, in which you are allowed to enroll your ſelves in the <hi>Catalogue of Chriſtians.</hi> And, oh that the Lord would ſet home this one tryal to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of our Souls, then we may ſay, <hi>The Lord is my God,</hi> and <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his.</hi>
