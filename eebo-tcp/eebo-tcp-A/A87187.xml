            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Firſt, Gods goodneſſe is to be praiſed, who having indued man with knowledge above the beaſts of the field, and put all things under his feet,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſa.</hi> 28.26, 27, 28.</note> he doth in a more ſpeciall manner (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phet ſaith) inſtruct the Husbandman to diſcretion, and doth teach him how to order his affairs for the beſt advantage of Humane Societies.</p>
            <p>Secondly, his Providence is to be acknowledged in bringing things to light, which without his good hand would have been loſt and lien in darkneſſe, as this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe would have been, if he had not ſtirred up ſome favourable Inſtruments to preſerve it, and bring it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my hand to be publiſhed for the Common good.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Inſtruments whom he hath employed both to bring forth this birth into the World, and to preſerve it after it was brought forth, deſerve ſome commendation. He that was made Inſtrumentall to bring it forth into the World, is not yet known unto

me: for although I have endeavoured by a diligent ſearch to finde out his name, yet I have not been able to compaſſe the matter: onely this I have been told, that the Author of this Deſigne was an aged Miniſter of the Goſpel, who for the ſpace of many years had for his own recreation, and that he might be ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble alſo to others experimented this part of Husbandry which at laſt he reſolved by this Treatiſe to make pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, but was by death prevented; the place of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode being ſaid to be <hi>Loving-land</hi> neer <hi>Yarmouth.</hi> He who did preſerve it from being loſt, and gave it to a friend of mine, is the Honourable Collonel <hi>John Barkſtead,</hi> the preſent Lieutenant of the Tower, a Gentleman whom I know not, but ſuch as know him do give him this Character, that he is of a very pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and ingenuous Spirit; in his Military Relations, exceeding active and circumſpect; zealous for Juſtice and good Order, to repreſſe the licentiouſneſſe of the times; and one who being capable of publick thoughts and generous cares, is willing freely to communicate and impart the ſame to all that can reap any benefit thereby. As for my ſelf, I claim nothing but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to be the Publiſher thereof, that I may be Inſtrumentall to advance the comforts of many there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and ſo help forward the Authors honeſt Deſigne; and I am the more willing to divulge this brief Tract upon this Subject, becauſe it will ſerve as a fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to a larger Volume of Fruit-trees, which an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced friend of mine, Mr. <hi>Ralph Auſtin</hi> hath in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe to put forth at <hi>Oxford.</hi> Such as have peruſed Mr. <hi>Blithe's</hi> Improver improved (a Book worth the reading by all that apply themſelves to Husbandry) in

               </note> and that by a happy Union of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the peaceable ſettlement of the affections of all people under the preſent Government, we ſhall live as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and ſtudy by the wayes of Common Induſtry to ſtrengthen the hands of thoſe that bear Rule over us, and are ſet for our defence; whoſe burthen, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be extraordinary great, yet by the good hand of God upon us, it will be greatly eaſed and leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened, when all hands ſhall ſuffer themſelves to be ſet a work, and the earth yield her increaſe. For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the preſent conſtitution of the Nation (if we become not ſo fatally and more then brutiſhly miſerable, as to ſtudy continually one anothers ruine) is not in ſo weak and dangerous a condition, as it was in Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s dayes when ſhe came firſt to the Crown. For then as Biſhop <hi>Carleton</hi> deſcribes it, the ſtate of affairs was far otherwiſe then now it is,<note place="margin">

            <pb facs="tcp:166420:4"/>
            <p>
               <hi>She [Queene</hi> Elizabeth] <hi>did not ſerve God in vain. For it is a thing to be wondered at, that the land being</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">That is, when ſhe came firſt to the Crown.</note> then <hi>without ſtrength, without Forces, without Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, yea, without Armour; all things neceſſary ſhould be ſo ſuddenly furniſhed. She had provided Armour at Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp, but King</hi> Philip <hi>cauſed that to be ſtayed. Yet was ſhe not diſcouraged, but laid out much money upon Armour though ſhe found the Treaſury but poore. She procured Armour and Weapons out of Germany. She cauſed many great Guns to be caſt of Braſſe and Iron. And Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and favour appeared in her protection. For</hi> new mines of Braſſe <hi>were found at Keſwike, that had long bin neglected. From whence there was not onely ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent matter to ſupply her wants, but abundance thereof to be tranſported to other Countreys. The ſtone called</hi> Lapis Calaminaris, <hi>whoſe uſe is needfull for working in Braſſe, was alſo at the ſame time firſt found in England. There was proviſion made at home alſo for the making of Gun-powder. Which was done firſt here by her commandement: For before, it was bought and imported.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Berwick before her time, was weak and had but 500 Souldiers: She fortified the town, made the new inner wall and increaſed the number of Souldiers and their ſtipends, that proviſion might be made for the training up of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Souldiers and martiall men. She provided a Navy, the beſt furniſhed that ever England ſaw. Neither needed ſhe to do as her Father &amp; Anceſtours were wont to do, when they wanted Ships, to ſend for Ships and hire them from Hamburg, Lubeck, Dantiſk, Genua and Venice; for ſhe had them readie at home to ſerve her. Yea all the good Townes upon the Sea-coaſt, beholding this incredible ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity and forwardneſſ in their Prince, ſtrived alſo to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<pb facs="tcp:166420:4"/>
the ſame, and therefore with great cheerefullneſſe and readineſſe built Ships for warre. So that in a ſhort time, the Queenes Ships and thoſe of the ſubjects joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, roſe to ſuch a number, that they were able to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy twenty thouſand men in ſea-fight at once. The Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the Gentlemen and Yeomen, did all ſtrive to anſwer ſo noble a reſolution of their Prince. And therefore great ſtore of Armour and Weapons were every where provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And brave ſpirits were bred and inabled to ſervice, whereby they became an helpe and Ornament to their Countrey; ſo that Queene</hi> Elizabeth <hi>was quickly growne ſo ſtrong, that all her Adverſaries were not able to hurt her. And was not this a great work of God, that ſo weak a Woman ſhould be able to defend her ſelfe againſt ſo many, ſo potent enemies? Yea, and not onely to match them, but to maſter them? This was Gods doing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This Remembrance of her condition, and of Gods wonderfull preſervation of this Nation at that time, ſhould not onely encourage us to hope ſtill in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, whereof we have as great experience hitherto as ever ſhe had, but alſo direct us to the performance of the duties fitting us for the continuance of ſuch mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies towards us. For as then all the neighbours of this Nation were either open enemies or uncertain friends, ſo it now may fall out again in this juncture of time, that we ſhall finde none abroad cordially to appear for us; but if we be found faithfull to one another at home in minding the intereſt of the Goſpel, in ſeeking Peace and Truth, in ſetling Judgement, in repreſſing the enormous ſcandals which are broken forth, and in advancing all manner of Induſtrie, we may expect
<pb facs="tcp:166420:5"/>
the ſame ſucceſſe which that bleſſed Queen had, and a greater Harveſt of Spirituall and Temporall Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings then ever yet this Nation hath received.
