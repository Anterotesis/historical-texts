         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter the death of my late dear and precious little one, I looked into what he had left, and found a little Legacy of Grace from God for you and yours, left by him (besides what was lost through the too great care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness of such as were about him in his sickness) but these reliques at last were faithfully set down for you &amp; yours in writing from his mouth, which being of value in my conscience (and those. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with, who were Witnesses thereof) I durst not detain, (whoever are so full as to despise them) hoping the distribution hereof will be to the refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every hungry soul.</p>
            <p>I intended at first to have sent them with an Epistle directed to your Children themselves, and to his School-fellows especially, (who commend his harmless conversation amongst them before his effectual calling of God in Christ Iesus, had so overlaid through Grace all those endowments,
<pb facs="tcp:35767:4"/>
begetting deep abasements for School-slightiness amongst the most sober sort, to his becoming whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as it were) another new creature since their acquaintance with him:) But upon more serious consideration of the trust committed to me, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I must be accountable; I have for my own se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and clearing (as <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 20. 26, 27.) thought it meet to commend it to your managing and improvement faithfully towards their eternal good estate, praying you to discharge your trust herein, on the behalf of your little ones, and see that none of them play it away (by means of your slightiness) lest you weep with them at the last, knowing that you also must give an account of this and them to God, as committed to your charge: And I beseech you beware, that herein, neither love to this World (nor any thing in this World, either the riches, or honour, or wisdom, &amp;c. thereof) nor any weakness in the ensuing Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise (either in the esteem of that wisdom in You, or real shortness in the Publisher thereof) may make you afraid your Children should follow God so fully after the example herein, lest it come against you, as the Lord hath said, the <hi>Queen</hi> of the South and Men of <hi>Nineveh</hi> shall, against some too like this Generation.</p>
            <p>How far it may concern your selves to become as little children (in the sence of <hi>1 Cor. 14. 20</hi> and <hi>Mat. 18. 3.</hi>) like the little subject of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> discourse, I leave to your consciences who sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

vouchsafe to reade it over humbly, and weigh it uprightly in the wisdom which is from above; but sure I am such bowels of mercy to your poor Children, as be get most sollicitude for the souls of them which remain from the Pestilence, before the woful day come, will prove most profitable, when all earthly promotions will stand them in no stead, but may be bewailed to have hurt the possessors of them: Beware therefore lest your want of wisdom herein expose your tender vessels, newly lanched into the sea of this sinful world, and richly laden with variety of Natures endowments, to miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in their great voyage Heaven-wards, for want of your skilful steerage of them amongst those Rocks and Sands, on which so many have suffered shipwrack to their utter undoing, through their over-bold adventure thereby, against such fair warnings, as <hi>Prov. 4. 14, 15. Luke 8. 14. 1 Joh. 2. 15, 16. Isa. 5. 12.</hi> I will therefore only set up a Sea-mark to warn you of four or five (least seen through self-love) on which multitudes have early been split and bulged, fulfilling the Word of the Lord, <hi>1 Tim. 6. 9.</hi> But <hi>they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Towards which those Parents prove unhappy Pilots who are,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Inordinately fond of Children in minority.</item>
               <item>2. Vainly inconsiderate in the Schooling of them.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb facs="tcp:35767:5"/>3. Unconscionably worldly in disposing them to outward Callings.</item>
               <item>4. Earthly-minded or ambitious in bestowing them in Marriages.</item>
               <item>5. Negligent in Family-duty, or of ill conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation in the use thereof, to the stumbling their Children by bad example.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Indeed most of these have been the sin and shame of Professing-Parents, and the spoil of their poor Childrens souls; and my hope of good times lies much in the expectation of a Spirit of Holiness upon Children, to give them escape from the sin of their fathers, few of whom I fear will live to inherit the Good they look for, through such spoyl this world hath made in their spirit, as declares too plainly they have supposed, as 1 Tim. 6. 5. that, <hi>Gain is Godliness,</hi> what-ever they say or profess to the contrary; And the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Fathers will humbly accept it as great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from the Lord, (after such provocation) if they find Grace, in return to the Prayer, <hi>Psal. 90. 16.</hi> and the fulfilling <hi>Psal. 45. 16. Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children,</hi> &amp;c. O therefore that Children may enter into more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar obligation to Christ as the Lord, with heartiest Hosanna's in the highest, in sence of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>redeemed,</hi> (in this evil-day) as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures speak, <hi>from the vain conversation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by tradition from their Parents,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 18. and follow Christ soveraignly, <hi>Rev. 1.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:35767:5"/>
               <hi>4.</hi> Learning of him, in all their subjection to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, the holy limits laid down, <hi>Eph. 6. 1.</hi> that they <hi>obey</hi> always only <hi>in the Lord;</hi> that is, as they command according to Christ, whom all are to hear in the highest, <hi>Mat. 17. 5.</hi> as they would walk well-pleasing to God; for I fear many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents who make great profession, are grown very vain, first, towards Children in minority, so fondly affecting them to their hurt, as if (with all their baubles) they were made to be but Apes and Baubles to Childish Parents for their present plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, instead of discharging faithfully their great trust for their immortal souls in their minority, by wisely nurturing them in the fear of the Lord, timely inclining their tender years towards God, as they would not make themselves sport so long and so far, with the first fruits of their Childrens folly in the witty office of stubborn natures wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and sinful speech, as by delight therein to expose the Child to such self-willedness, that at last through the Parents fondness they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Child should undergo a moments smart (though never so necessary) to preserve either body or spirit from sickness or sin.</p>
            <p>For hence the discerning Child perhaps is fitted (through Satan) more early for such Companions abroad, as were MEETING-MOCKERS, and smarted together at <hi>Bethel</hi> of old, under the great Fathers displeasure, for want of timely discharge of earthly Parents duty
<pb facs="tcp:35767:6"/>
towards restraining them, <hi>2 King. 2. 23, 24.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, though they may be restrained from this, (through their Parents profession) yet other inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate affection in neglect of the Lord doth often fulfil the threatning, <hi>Ezek. 24. 25.</hi> (against Professors fondness) in the lives of their little ones. Let not tender Parents therefore look lightly over such Scriptures as these, <hi>Prov. 22. 6. 15.</hi> &amp; ch. 29. 15, 19. and ch. 23. 13, 14. <hi>Eph. 6. 4.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if Children be wisely steered by tender Parents through this danger in minority, and grow up soberly by degrees under their care, and now fit for School, how vainly inconsiderate Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents become, what they learn there, or by whom they are taught, that word, <hi>Luke 16. 8.</hi> in this may be for a Lamentation: How do the Children of this world grow stricter in their care, lest their Children at Schools should unawares learn the excellent knowledge of Christ, than Professors are, lest their Children at School should learn the vileness of this world.</p>
            <p>O the heart-greived complaint of this Scholler (on his sick-bed) over School-pastimes, choaking for a season his first serious convictions, wherein yet he was not long, nor at large, nor an associat ever with any deboist, but with the most sober youths.</p>
            <p>And what tender sense had he before his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Name of God blasphemed, in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued upholding and preferring of Heathen Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
<pb facs="tcp:35767:6"/>
(by Christian Schoolmasters) wherein Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Hell are turned into fictions, to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding Professors Children to setled Atheism, or unsetled profession of Christ, the Eternal Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Glory to come; but how did the soul of this little one (in need of favour, and dread of wrath, in hopes towards Heaven and fear of Hell) tremble hereat? I desire to remember, with self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abasement, and exceeding joy for the Angel of the Covenant, who met with him, saying, <hi>This is the Way, walk in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how (alas) are our Daughters also brought up by professing-Parents, as if they would have them attain the cursed commendation of <hi>Herodias</hi> Daughter, <hi>Mat. 14. 6.</hi> rather than in the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and adorning, <hi>Psal. 45. 13, 14.</hi> become truly lovely to Christ, v. 10. How many, O how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, like <hi>Micha's</hi> Mother, <hi>Judg. 17. 4.</hi> are at greatest cost for snares to their Childrens souls! How did the pride of our new-blown Gentry (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great profession) bud and blossom in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities foregoing, before their fall, as before Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, <hi>Ezek. 7. 10.</hi> and it were to be wished that abused fulness were not lusted after again by any already under smart for it, unsensible of their sin.</p>
            <p>But if Children die in the midst of these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights (or the Plague take them in paths so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the expectation of the Lord, <hi>Isa. 22. 13, 14.</hi>) then how few Parents (thus preparing
<pb facs="tcp:35767:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them for spoyl before) speak a word of their sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, dancing, stately tripping, mantling and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing attainments, or any of that vain tribe of their trinkets and trumperies, recounted by the Spirit more particularly, <hi>Isa. 3. 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.</hi> about the most modish uses whereof perhaps yet they spent more circumspection, and anger at their Childrens dulness, than about their sin and soul-neglects to the last; When conscience also upbraiding the visited Children in the words of <hi>Rom. 6. 21. What profit had you then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death:</hi> Then perhaps they too late begin to teach the Child untimely to take up some words of God, or Christ, or Heaven, or Faith, or Repentance, (little thought of before) and to apply a promise out of the path, to uphold them in hopes of rest from Him whom they rejected for rule, whilst they could enjoy their vanity, and flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the Childs good estate (though never so doubtful) especially having the approbation of any easie <hi>Prophet</hi> they have set up for themselves, as <hi>Ezek. 44. 8.</hi> in the case.</p>
            <p>But why? Parents, why? is not that Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on which only you dare lay stress in Plagues and in death (which is so certain to you and your children, yet in a time so uncertain both to you and them) preferred in life, as the great Lesson commended and commanded by the Master,

               <hi>Mat. 6. 33.</hi> chap. 11. 29. who must judge us at the last day according to what he hath taught us, and we may not so easily trifle away, <hi>Joh. 12. 48.</hi> Be considerate then Parents in your Childrens Schooling, lest the door should be shut, and they as the foolish Virgins (when they can be vain no longer) are willing to learn what may be hid from their eyes.</p>
            <p>But if Shipwrack be not in this danger neither, a Rock is in sight, and Sands about it, that split or suck up many a stately Vessel that saileth too nigh, and that is called a CALLING (though the <hi>High Calling of God in Christ Jesus</hi> the Scripture more calls so, is seldom so called now by Professors) and in this how unconscionable are Parents in the dispose of their Children to their undoing! for how little are they bounded by such Commands and Counsel in the case; as <hi>Titus 3. 14. 1 Cor. 7. 24.</hi> How few Children therefore abide with God in their outward Calling, and how many with the World, the Flesh and the Devil, either in the dishonest nature thereof, or sinful entrances thereinto, vile customs therein, or to effect their freedom (so called, though the very servants of corruption) therefore, which yet if never so honest in all should be minded, to the neglecting the Invitation of the Gospel to Christ becomes as pernicious as open prophaness; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he complains of souls so swallowed up in the most lawfull outward callings, as the Epidemical

means of perdition, Luke 14. 18. Mat. 22. 5.</p>
            <p>How many poor Children herein are, instead of being (as <hi>Samuel</hi>) lent to the Lord, sold to the world by their parents as long as they live, defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring soul-concernment till death, when they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment too late they had not such a Mother as <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> had in their youth, and mourn at the last, as <hi>Eccl. 12. 1.</hi> wishing in the day of wrath (when riches profit not) that their Parents had lesse indulged their bodies for a moment, and more their immortall souls.</p>
            <p>Yet <hi>Fourthly;</hi> If this be escaped, the earthly mind and ambition of Parents in marriage adds a multiplying Cypher; as after <hi>Ahabs</hi> sin, so obnoxious before, <hi>1 Kings 16. 31.</hi> and a <hi>Sydo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> with silver, is now far more esteemed than a daughter of <hi>Sion</hi> without it, or with little less; as if the half Language of <hi>Ashdod</hi> already, were intended to be perfected, rather than our posterities more compleatness in Christ. O shameful Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors! How unlike <hi>Rebecca</hi> are you herein, <hi>Gen. 27. 46.</hi> Surely <hi>Smithfield</hi> would better become such your Marriage-Markets, than a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Christ: How few hereby find a Wife, as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaketh, <hi>Prov. 18. 22.</hi> (that is, to the end God instituted them) but seeking money (as a HELP-MEET to them) get a Woman with the World, and the Devil with her unawares (as <hi>Eve,</hi> when the mouth of the Deceiver) to a bitter day, perhaps a <hi>Saphira</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:35767:8"/>
helping (by hypocrisie) to save their earthly Estates, and lose their Souls. Herein Parents add to their prayer for Childrens Conversion, their pains to effect their Perdition; as one that prayeth a fire may go out, adding fuel thereto, so are these provisions for Lust under prayer for Life. <hi>Did not</hi> Solomon <hi>King of</hi> Israel <hi>sin by these things? yet among many Nations, was there no King like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him King over all</hi> Israel, <hi>Neh. 13. 26. Nevertheless, even him did outlandish-women cause to sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But lastly, How doth neglect of Parents in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of families, or ill example therein before their Childden, either in pride, covetousness, wrath, lightness, or other ill carriage (unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing profession in Parents) expose their obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Children, and make fruitless and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous their performances amongst them, when they shall discern them to fulfil <hi>Tit. 1. 16.</hi> before them; Beware therefore of this above all, that you lay not a stumbling example before them, but that in simplicity and godly sincerity you shew them your good conversation in Christ, filling up faithfully every relation in secret (according to your open profession) that they be not stumbled by finding the contrary: for O the wound which Christ an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>O tender Parents, for the Lords sake then, and for the sake of the soules under your charge, pray for your own return to the attaining again the holy Examples of Fathers in Christ, that <hi>they who dwell under your shadow, may revive as the Corn, and grow as the Vine, the sent whereof shal be as the Wine of</hi> Lebanon, Hos. 14. 7.

            <p>Hence did he earnestly entreat his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he might be brought up with him in his own calling, for which he had Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enough, to which he was very enclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and in which he expressed great apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with delight, more than to play, upon all idle times. But being returned to School for a season, to attain the <hi>Hebrew</hi> reading, into which he was entring, it pleased God to visit him with sickness, to perfect his compleature for his Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, as followeth.</p>

            <p>Hereupon (finding also his strength came not forwards towards the end of the Summer) they were again brought into <hi>London.</hi> Now it pleased God that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Waterman that brought the Children to <hi>London,</hi> and the Servant that brought this Child (being not able to go) in his<note place="margin">Afflicting Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences work stil for true good to him.</note> armes to his Lodging, immediately fell sick and died of the Pestilence, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the serious mind of the Child, though yet he would not endure to hear it called Melancholy, conducing much to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward rooting in that which could not be shaken.</p>
            <p>The first Lesson from the Scriptures in the Family was from <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9. 10. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave whither</hi>

            <p>This motion proved also to the great humbling of the other two, and wrought mightily to self-abasement, in serious sense also, that the first fruit of true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version was to call on the Lord in truth and not to be ashamed to confess him and it was soon after manifested, that they

had through Grace received the Spirit of Adoption from him, and were help'd to witness unto him, unto their admission into his house with joy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caleb</hi> then craved a little Closet for himself, that he might seek the Lord in secret more seriously; which was to his great satisfaction prepared, but by daily decay to his outward, grew more sensible now of the Winter approaching, but the Spring-time to his inward-man was daily made manifest; God was pleased to make his weak Bed his Closet, and the weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some nights his seasons of much serious consideration, brought to light daily in plenty of wisdom, imploying true turning to God most apparently, not recorded till the visible decay also of his weak outward tabernacle, daily made us fear it was the anointing with fresh Oyl for his Burial: And then his Mother (admiring the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom<note place="margin">The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his sayings at last.</note> by which he spake) was minded to gather up what fragments she could in writing (without his observing it) as he daily dropt them in season with favour, declaring him to be wholly a new man to the Lord, on whom he now began more to see he believed to his support (though his seeming reserved and drooping po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture (after his first dayes rejoycing to see

his Parents in <hi>London</hi>) he would not own to be melancholy, but solemn meditation about his eternal estate, with hope and some joy (yet mixed at first with more fears and doubtings;) nor could any thing allure him into the Country again, though his Father offered his company (the Plague and number of his Patients be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to abate) because he prized (he said) the opportunities of the Word in<note place="margin">Soul-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction preferred before health or life, and the fruit which followed</note>

               <hi>could not lye still in one place, yet afterwards I was at great ease, and could lie very quiet though I had no sleep.</hi> Then cryed he out of his vileness also, most humbly, and said, <hi>I see now how I was by nature plunged in sin and iniquity, but my Lord Iesus Christ</hi> (which he uttered ardently) <hi>hath been a ransom for me:</hi> and spake particularly of the vanity of his mind before his sickness, and blessed the Lord for his Visitation.

Before the end of the day he was carried back to his own
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:35767:29"/>
Bed for repose, and his Father going to him at night, he said, <hi>Father, pray you have</hi>

            <p>The next day, being the fourteenth, he seemed much weaker, but still minded this (as his duty) with great desire to be doing it: but (having not been up in many dayes before, but as aforesaid, from one Bed into another) his Father asked him, how he could thiuk to go about such a work, seeing he was not able to be got up out of his bed for a moment (his thigh<note place="margin">His thigh measured, not full 4. inches about.</note> being then not full four inches about) and he not being able to endure so much as a Doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He did believe God would help him<note place="margin">Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully sheweth all his strength to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with his father that he might be obedient.</note> to rise to do that his work, and give him strength; and he had some already, so that he was able to rise now, if his Father would have him. To which his Father (thinking it might convince or refresh him) consented, and he was taken up in warm Blankets, and sate by his Father on Pillows upright, well nigh two hours; in which time he had very gracious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, and with chearfulness said, <hi>Father,</hi>

               <hi>the Lord is my strength, of whom should I be afraid? Indeed you are my dear Father, but I have a dearer Father in Heaven.

               <hi>O how do I long to see Christ formed in you!</hi> And looking to his Father, he said, Why indeed, Father, she had many very good expressions in the Country, and would say to the Maid in a morning, <hi>What mercy is it that we are alive, and so many thousands taken away at</hi> London, <hi>and so many little Children.</hi> Then speaking of the Adversaries to the People of God, he said, <hi>their time is but short:</hi> And being asked,

            <p>On the fifteenth day his Father went into the Country, and meeting with some Christian Friends, improved that oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for their earnest advice, with prayer setting forth his great strait in the<note place="margin">Friends advise his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</note> case; and taking their answer one by one, upon what they had heard, both for and against it, they unanimously advised the answering his desire therein, leaving the issue unto the Lord, whose Wisdom they judged had engaged the Child herein, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

            <p>And then imployed one to search dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently for an House near a River, where it might most conveniently the next day be performed: but as he returned home, calling on a Christian Friend, (whose im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment

the time came his father spake briefly from <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. <hi>I am the door; by me if any man enter in he shall be saved.</hi> He attended<note place="margin">Paproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to the Lords Supper.</note> with very great diligence, and partook with great reverence, sitting up in his bed to attend, and afterwards humbly desired thanks might be returned to the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation for their love and care herein.</p>
            <p>The next day, being the first day of the week, his Father tarried at home with him, and enlarged upon the latter part of these words, (<hi>viz.)

            <p>At night his Father supped with him upon a small Bird, and afterward he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned thanks; a Physician coming in whilst he was speaking, and looking in at the Beds feet with his hat on, he enlarged his desires, <hi>that God would strengthen him</hi>

                  <l>Which was indeed dear <hi>Caleb's</hi> choicest food.</l>
                  <l>And seeing he so follow'd his dear Master,</l>
                  <l>I would not faint although he ran much faster;</l>

                  <l>But grace perhaps did each day for a year</l>
                  <l>Seal him a Pattent in return of Prayer</l>
                  <l>For Life, chiefly, that Converts he might make,</l>
                  <l>And took him hence for the Election sake;</l>
                  <l>That safely this might be set forth of him,</l>
                  <l>And he not hazarded hereby to sin.</l>
                  <l>For few can bear his praise, and few reproof,</l>
                  <l>But both, I trust, hereby shall now help Youth</l>
                  <l>To their Conversion, like to <hi>Caleb's;</hi> then</l>

                  <l>That yet I live, and <hi>Caleb</hi> fell asleep.</l>

What it is, we truly desire it may be blest unto you to the ends designed by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this little Book; It being the main, If not the only end why this little follower of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to live. It may be the breathings from that heart that so much longed (being converted) to convert others, may be of use, though imparted at the second hand, we have seen made good, <hi>Pro.</hi> 14. 27. <hi>The fear of the Lord is a fountain of Life,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>He that believeth in me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water,</hi> John 7. 31. Some of us have been much convinced by what we saw, what bare conversions there are in the world, and how far short of <hi>belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as the Scripture hath said,</hi> most men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are, that leaves them so short of the Spirit, hinted 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7.
