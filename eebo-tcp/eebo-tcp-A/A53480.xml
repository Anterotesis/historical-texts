            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <l>Pitying the Kings misfortune, thus reply'd;</l>
                     <l>That, mighty Prince, to which I most pretend</l>
                     <l>Is, from an Enemy you'll turn a Friend:</l>
                     <l>And if you'll grant what now is begg'd by me,</l>
                     <l>I'le prize it more then this dayes Victory.</l>
                     <l>These words the Prince with such an Accent grac'd,</l>
                     <l>As by the King he closely was embrac'd,</l>
                     <l>Who told him, in this Action you have shown,</l>
                     <l>You have more ways to Conquer me then one,</l>
                     <l>And, Sir, to prove this does my Mind subdue;</l>
                     <l>That which you ask of Me I beg of You.</l>

                           <hi>MY Death forces me to discover by what Arts I obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, from the Prince of</hi> Wales, <hi>the faire</hi> Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagenet. <hi>Before He ador'd her I did; and as soon as he fell in Love, (not knowing mine) he made me his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; but the King, being against the match, the Prince the better to cloud his reall passion for</hi> Plantagenet, <hi>seem'd to have one for the fair</hi> Aurelia; <hi>but still trusted me with the Superscription, Cypher, and Seale, which he used when he writ to my</hi> Plantagenet, <hi>and I had the fatal employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of carrying all their Letters.</hi>

                     <l>Which, Sir, on you a greater Name bestows</l>
                     <l>By conquering Them by whom he conquered Those:</l>
                     <l>'Tis more by Vertue <hi>England</hi> to o'recome,</l>
                     <l>Then by the <hi>English</hi> to beat Christendome.</l>
                     <l>As when the Universe was to be made,</l>
                     <l>The Vast Design was on the Waters laid;</l>
                     <l>So you in Conquering it like Method keep,</l>
                     <l>Laying your first Foundation in the Deep:</l>
                     <l>Though the Black Prince, so happy, Sir, did prove,</l>
                     <l>As to be Crown'd with Victory and Love,</l>
                     <l>Yet Sir, he knows from you he may receive</l>
                     <l>A Nobler Crown then War or Love can give;</l>
                     <l>This makes him like the Poet trembling stand,</l>
                     <l>Till, Sir, that Crown be given him by your Hand.</l>

                     </l>

                     <l>To be a Wit (believe me, Sir, 'tis true)</l>
                     <l>Is the worst State a Man can Fall into.</l>
                     <l>The Wits first vow, is, that they none will spare,</l>
