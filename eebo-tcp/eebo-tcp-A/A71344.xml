            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>I Have been here ſome times before with you, but never with more willingneſs, then I am at this time: And there then
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:97700:482"/>
be few men in the Kingdom, who have longed more impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to have theſe Bills paſſed, than I have done to paſs them; and I hope they will be the Foundation of much Security and Happineſs to us all.</p>
                     <p>I do very willingly pardon all that is pardoned by this Act of <hi>Indemnity,</hi> to that time which is mentioned in the Bill; nay, <hi>I</hi> will tell you, that from that time to this day, I will not uſe great ſeverity, except in ſuch caſes where the malice is notorious, and the Publick Peace exceedingly concerned; but for the time to come, the ſame diſcretion and conſcience which diſpoſed me to the clemency I have expreſſed, which is moſt agreeable to My Nature, will oblige Me to all rigor and ſeverity, how contrary ſoever it be to my Nature, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe who ſhall not now acquieſs, but continue to manifeſt their Sedition and diſlike of the Government, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in action or words. And I muſt conjure you all (my Lords and Gentlemen) to concur with me in this juſt and neceſſary Severity; and that you will in your ſeveral Stations be ſo jealous of the Publick Peace, and of my particular Honor, that you will cauſe exemplary Juſtice to be done upon thoſe who are guilty of ſeditious Speeches or Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, as well as thoſe who break out into ſeditious Actions: And that you will beleive thoſe who delight in reproaching and traducing My Perſon, not to be well affected to You, and the Publick Peace. Never King valued himſelf more upon the affections of his People, than I do; nor do I know a better way to make my ſelfe ſure of your affections, than by being juſt and kind to you all: And whilſt I am ſo I pray let the world ſee that I am poſſeſſed of your affections.</p>
                     <p>For your <hi>Pole-Bill,</hi> I do thank you as much as if the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney were to come into My Own Coffers; and wiſh with all my Heart, that it may amount to as great a ſum as you reckon upon: If the work be well and orderly done, to which it is deſigned, I am ſure I ſhall be the richer by it in
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:97700:483"/>
the end; and upon My word, if I had wherewithall, I would My ſelf help you, ſo much I deſire the buſineſs done. I pray very earneſtly, as faſt as Money comes in, diſcharge that great burthen of the Navy, and disband the Army as faſt as you can; and till you can disband the reſt, make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for their ſupport.</p>
                     <p>I do conjure you, as you love Me, let me not hear the noiſe of Free quarter, which will be imputed to my want of Care and Government, how innocent ſoever I am; and therefore be ſure you prevent it.</p>
                     <p>I am ſo confident of your affections, that I will not move you in any thing that immediately relates to My Self, and yet I muſt tell you, I am not richer, that is, I have not ſo much money in my Purſe, as when I came to you. The truth is, I have lived principally ever ſince upon what I brought with me, which was indeed your money; for you ſent it to me, and I thank you for it. The weekly expence of the Navy, eats up all you have given me by the Bill of Tonnage and Poundage. Nor have I been able to give my Brothers one ſhilling ſince I came into <hi>England,</hi> nor to keep any Table in my Houſe, but what I eat my ſelf. And that which troubles me moſt, is, to ſee many of you come to Me to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and to think that you muſt go ſome where elſe to ſeek your Dinner.</p>
                     <p>I do not mention This to <hi>You,</hi> as any thing that troubles <hi>Me,</hi> do but take care of the Publick, and for what what is neceſſary for the peace and quiet of the Kingdom, and take your own time for My own particular, which I am ſure you will provide for, with as much affection and franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as I can deſire.</p>
