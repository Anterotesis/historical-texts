            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>The cause thereof, besides those I haue spoken, are, first, because thou findest not after thy sinne a present controulement of sinne, thou thinkest thou hast not offended: I oft suffer the spirit of slumber to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take trangressors, that I may by my spirit more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly waken my Saints: then doe the wicked take courage and transgresse, and doe wickedly, but I wil<note place="margin">Hab. 1 11</note> search them with light, and visite them that are frosen in their dregges, and say in<note place="margin">Zeph. 1. 12</note>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:544:48"/>
their hearts, they Lord wil neither doe good nor euill; so because the wicked are not taken in their sin, they stretch out their hand to<note place="margin">Iob. 21. 9</note> more wickednesse, their houses are safe from feare, neither is my rodde vpon them, they say vnto me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from vs, for wee desire not the knowledge of thy wayes; but they shall<note place="margin">Ier. 12. 2. 3</note> bee as stubble before the winde, and as chaffe which the storme carrieth sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly away: I shall lay vp his iniquity for his children, doth the way of the wicked prosper? yet are they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the day of slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the worlde coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the proude blessed,<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 15</note> and they that tempt me, are

deliuered, but I haue a booke of remembrance, of them that feare me, and the armes of the wicked shall be broken, but the Lorde<note place="margin">Psa. 31. 17</note> vpholdeth the iust man. The second cause is, because thou resteth in my vniuersal promises, which although they be true and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet they can minister no true consolation to thee, except thou make a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler application of them to thy selfe; by the word thou seest thy sinnes pardonable, yet it is another thing to haue sinnes remissible, and another to assure thy selfe that they are already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, for then thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest search thy selfe more narrowly, and purge thy
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:544:49"/>
selfe from inwarde sinne, as from outward, and bee wholly transformed vnto a new holy &amp; righteous life, therefore the loue of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse departeth from thee, and thou retirest to thy olde sins againe, which will breed much sorrowe of heart, to remember thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sinnes, to see the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of them, to apply my iudgements to them, and to prouoke thy selfe to sorrow for them. The third cause, is thy slacknes, in not espy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy mother, speciall and predominant sinne in thee, by marking the most checks of thy conscience, and the reproaches of thy enemies, whereof thou maiest easily bee shortly conquerour, if
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:544:50"/>
