            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
REMONSTRANCE
OF THE
SOLDIERY
To the Right Honourable, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common councell
of the City of LONDON.</head>
            <p>WHile the Loud Cry of our oppreſt Country, is now every where reſounding and
reaching up to Heaven, againſt the intollerable Tyranny of our falſe and Treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous
Maſters, who with good words, a Bit and a Knock have drilled us on to
the utter Ruine and Diſhonour of this once Glorious Kingdome; and being now
made ſenſible that we carry our Armes meerly for the Safe-Guard and upholding of a Deſperate
Crue, whoſe demerits ſuffer not their guilty ſouls to think of any Expedient or Remedy to
cure any Diſtreſſes but their own; that therefore we may Eaſe their Miſchievous brain of any
further Deſignes tending to the accompliſhment of our poor Countries Slavery, which they can
obtain and effect by no hands but Ours; and to eaſe Our minds and conſciences of that acceſſary
guilt, with which we may be juſtly charged.</p>
            <p>VVe do <hi>Remonſtrate and Declare,</hi> That ſeeing it hath pleaſed God by his VViſdom and Juſtice
to make Our Old Officers that were the Inſtruments and Authors of all that Confuſion and
Ruine which hath overwhelmed theſe Nations ſince 1648 a hiſſing and ſhame to all the VVorld,
and that by a Rod of their own making, Thereby to undeceive and rightly inform Us of Our
unlawful continuance in this Our preſent Military employment; That VVe do from Our
very Souls deſire a diſmiſſion from under the Command, and (we were a going to ſay) Pay of
this arbitrary tyrannical power, and would preſently diſband Our Selves, and deſert Our Colours
if it were not folly and madneſs to expoſe Our ſingle individual Selves to the fury and rage of
Our Maſters, who being backt by General <hi>Monks</hi> neer aſſiſtance, would otherwiſe wreak their
utmoſt revenge upon us.</p>
            <p>VVe do therefore unanimouſly, cordially, and readily tender Our ſervice, Our Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
to the <hi>Right Honourable the Lord Mayor of the City of London,</hi> to be directed, employed, and
ordered as to his Lordſhip and his Grave Councel ſhall ſeem convenient, being ready with any
the utmoſt hazzards (though we ſuppoſe the name of our aſſiſtance to his Lordſhips juſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
after a <hi>Free Parliament</hi> will doe the work) to redeem our miſerable Country, and
our former honour and renown.</p>
            <p>To that purpoſe we have ſecured our Armes, and are reſolved never more to ſubmit to the
members at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> till it be a free and full Houſe; and if room muſt be made for the Scotch
Army our lovely brethren, it ſhall be no way inconſiſtent we think with the liberty of the City
to admit and entertain us for gueſts, ſeeing it hath pleaſed God out of mercy to this Nation to
make us all of one mind and heart, to the bringing about his intended mercy to it.</p>
            <p>VVe have now ecchoed the univerſall deſires of the Nation, and if your Petitions and civill
extraordinary addreſſes to (as we hope that honourable perſon) Generall <hi>Monke</hi> do not prevaile,
ſay but the word onely, and give us ſome Commanders, and you ſhall ſee the anſwer and effect of
our Drums and Trumpets.</p>
            <div type="postscript">
               <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
               <p>The purport of this Remonſtrance was in our intentions long before; but the change of our Officers
and the diſtruſts and diviſions cunningly fomented by them among us, retarded the addreſſing of it to
your Lordſhip; but we hope it is now come in its beſt time.</p>
