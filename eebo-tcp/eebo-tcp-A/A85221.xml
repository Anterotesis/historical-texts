            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Rog.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Oh Sir, this is a ſmile of Fortune indeed, when in this melancholly Region of Abdication I am permitted, thanks to a kind Goaler, the converſation of the celebrated Mr. <hi>Ferg</hi>—, whoſe Perſon though I never had the Honour to be acquainted with, yet his Name and Merits have been my particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Familliarity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ferg.</speaker>
               <p>Yes Sir, I underſtand my Name and Merits have been your particular Intimacy; you have been both their Herauld and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian, and have blazon'd them in capital <hi>BLACKS</hi> in many a fair <hi>Obſervator.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Rog.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Really Sir, you do me a great deal of right; I have never been ſparing of <hi>Black</hi> and <hi>White:</hi> The flouriſhes of my Quill have been profuſely generous. I never ſaw any ſhining Feature, or <hi>Moſaick</hi> face, from Great <hi>Noll</hi>'s Noſe to <hi>Little Titus</hi> his Chin, but I have play'd the kind <hi>Lely.</hi> A beautiful Pen ſhould never want Drapery, where my pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil could furniſh it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ferg.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis worthily ſaid of you. You ſpeak like a plain Dealer.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Roger.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>But, Mr <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> I have had a long deſire of kiſſing your Hand by the way of congratulation, and welcome to our ſide. From a <hi>Saul</hi> to a <hi>Paul,</hi> a Perſecutor to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote; as there's joy even in Heaven at a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's converſion, give me leave to expreſs no common Tranſport, in gaining ſo conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a Patron to our glorious though, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, drooping Cauſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ferg.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, Sir <hi>Roger,</hi> I am a ſort of a Come-over, to that drooping Cauſe, as you call it, <hi>Ecce ſignum,</hi> theſe Bonds.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Roger.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Ay, that's our common misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. But, Mr. <hi>Ferg</hi>—, I hope the great Truths that I have ſo long preacht, publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and recorded, amongſt the many Eyes they have opened, have had ſome illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon Mr. <hi>Ferg</hi>—; for I ſhould be proud of being any ways inſtrumental to ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a Converſion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ferg.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, Sir <hi>Roger,</hi> not to boaſt any great operation upon me; for I am a meet Volunteer, and my whole Illumination is purely my own, nevertheleſs I muſt give thee this immortal Applauſe, That the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Zealots that have had any hand in this Plot, or been well-wiſhers towards it, are moſt, if not all, thy Diſciples; and all that die in it, are no better than thy Martyrs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Rog.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Good Heaven forbid! My Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs! What, draw innocent Blood upon my head: Lord have mercy on Me. I hope you are not in earneſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ferg.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, 'tis too true for a Jeſt. I ſay nothing but what I can prove.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Rog.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>How prove Sir! I hope you do not ſet up for an Evidence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ferg.</speaker>
               <p>No, Sir <hi>Roger,</hi> as I am a bonny <hi>Scot,</hi> I am more a Gentleman than to make a Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher; not but my natural, perſonal Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would go far, to tempt my mortal Frailty that way: However there's no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of me in that Caſe, for had I an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards it, I am affraid the World wants Faith, and a <hi>Ferg</hi>—'s Oracles would find but few Believers: And therefore pray Sir <hi>Roger,</hi> diſpel that bodily fear: All I have to ſay is only <hi>Inter nos.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Rog.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Nay, then you have diſpell'd my fear, and therefore pray go on with this bloody<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Charge againſt me, for I dare ſtand any Arraignment, where there's neither the face of Judge nor Jury, Mr. <hi>Ferg</hi>—.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ferg.</speaker>
               <p>Say you ſo? Then pray tell me

what are all our <hi>Jacobite</hi> Fools, but Pupils and Proſelites to thoſe two Pillars of thy Church, <hi>Jure Divino</hi> and <hi>Paſſive Obedience.</hi>

A King, at this rate by thy Aſſertion, provided his direct Succeſſion be unqueſtionable, in nothing elſe, though never ſo indirect, can be queſtionable: For he may Be what he pleaſe, and Do what he Pleaſe, Set up what he pleaſe, and Pull down what he pleaſe, Swear what we and our Laws pleaſe, and perform what he and his No Law pleaſe; Run away from his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple when he pleaſes, and Return when and how he pleaſe: In fine, That a Right Line ſanctifies all Wrong; That the True Blood in his Veins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Entitules him to the whole Blood in our Veins; And that if he pleaſe to take it, we muſt pleaſe to give it him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs our Tears or Prayers can ſheild off the Blow; for Sir <hi>Roger</hi> is pleas'd to allow no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Edge-Tool or Armour, Offenſive or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive for our protection.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ferg.</speaker>
               <p>Jeſt Sir! All Jeſt. There neither is, nor ever was any ſuch Divine Right in the World.</p>

So far from any thing of Divine in the caſe, that God Almighty himſelf Abdicated (or very little better) the very firſt King even of his own making; laid Miſgovernment to his charge, and Anointed his Succeſſor even before his death, and that too in the perſon of his darling <hi>David,</hi> the Man after his own heart; ſo far from a Son or Right Heir of <hi>Saul,</hi> that he was no Kin to the Family, ſo little was Royal Succeſſion the Care of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or ought to be the Quarrel of Man.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Conſidering then the Character the World gives of You, your Fluctuating Principles and uneaſineſs in all Governments, how comes it that thoſe worthy Gentlemen, concerned in this Glorious, tho dangerous Enterprize, duſt lodge ſo great and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a Truſt with ſuch volatile Mercury, as Mr. <hi>Ferg—'s?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ferg.</speaker>
               <p>My Character, ſay you! Why 'tis the only thing that recommended me to their Confidence. For pray, to compare Caſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us; you are Zealots and Partiſans in a Conſpiracy (forſooth) out of a principle of Right and Juſtice. But I am animated by a Sprightlier Fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> am for Mutiny and Miſchief, right or wrong. You act by dictates of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Honour; but I have been ſlighted and diſobliged by the preſent Government, and my Motives againſt it are Spight and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. And Revenge never weighs nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, when on the contrary, Honour may be tender and ſcrupulous: Beſides, yours is but the Love, but mine the Luſt of Rebellion: and Love may ſometimes cool, when Luſt always burns.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>In troth, Mr. <hi>Ferg</hi>—, this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſavours a little too much of the <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</hi> But you are a glorious <hi>Don John,</hi> and I am ſatisfied the worthy Gentlemen could not have made a nobler Choice, than ſuch a Friend and Champion, as Mr. <hi>Ferg</hi>—.</p>

               <speaker>Ferg.</speaker>
               <p>Nay Sir, ſince you touch me in that ſenſible part, I muſt tell you farther, That I am always the <hi>Almanzor</hi> of a Conſpiracy. <hi>Almanzor</hi>-like, I know neither one ſide nor to'ther, any longer then I am puſhing in it: But then like an <hi>Almanzor</hi> too, no Man puſhes ſo heartily and ſo home as I do. And for diſtinctions of which King, or what King, in ſhort, I run a muck at all Kings; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed at all Religions too: For, between Friends, My King, my Country, my Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, my Heaven, are all centured in my ſelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Rog.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Really Mr. <hi>Ferg</hi>—, you here give me ſo extraordinary; and withal ſo ingenious a Declaration, that I muſt acknowledge you a perſon truly worthy Admiration, though not altogether Imitation. For though you are an abſolute Original, and that no mean one, Yet, I confeſs, 'tis ſuch a one as I durſt not Copy. My tenderer Morals are a little more nice and ſqueamiſh; howe'er to give you your due renown; I heartily wiſh that all the Hands and Hearts, engaged in this Pious and honeſt Confederacy, had been all of your Nerve and Mould. For then, we might have hoped to have had an anſwerable ſucceſs to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the undertaking, and Reſolution of the Undertakers, and not to have had it thus poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſcarry, by ſo many Sieves and Spunges, the Leaky falſe Brothers, whoſe Cowardly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts and Apoſtacy has ſo weakly and baſely betray'd, it to our whole Cauſes utter Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Ruine. For truly, Sir, though I my ſelf cannot come up to your Heights, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I muſt do you this Right, to own you one of the moſt quallified Inſtruments, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark in any ſuch Religious and Righteous bold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cauſe. For indeed, 'tis alway my Maxim, <hi>That provided the Dagger be but Conſecrated, no matter whether the hand be or no.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ferg.</speaker>
               <p>There you ſay Right, Sir <hi>Roger;</hi> For we have Holy Writ on our ſide in that point. For do we not read that <hi>Cyrus</hi> the Great, tho' a Heathen and Infidel, is called the Servant of God: <hi>viz.</hi> For the great ends for which God had raiſed him. And with the ſame parity of Reaſon, our Grand Patron <hi>Lewis,</hi> is the moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Servant of Jeſus, though the moſt Faithful ſworn Brother of <hi>Mahomet.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Rog.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Nay, Mr. <hi>Ferg</hi>—, now you talk of ſuch Great Men in their Age, as a <hi>Cyrus:</hi> and a <hi>Lewis.</hi> From their Great Examples, I think it but highly reaſonable, and every ways honourable, that every Man that has the leaſt glowing ſpark of Ambition in his Veins, ſhould, and ought to ſignalize himſelf, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething that may make him Great and Famous in his Generation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ferg.</speaker>
               <p>Famous in his Generation! Is that all? Ay, Famous to Poſterity. That was always my Principle: To be a <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> or an <hi>Eroſtratus,</hi> to Found Churches, or Deſtroy Churches; Raiſe States, or ſubvert them; to do ſomething Great either one way or t'other; (no matter which) to attempt any thing, and ſhrink at nothing, that may leave an Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Name behind me.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Rog.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Nay, Mr. <hi>Ferg</hi>—, there we differ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> An <hi>Eroſtratus</hi> is a little too much. I declare I was never that hardy <hi>Bout<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

'Tis true, now you talk of that Famous <hi>Incendiary,</hi> I confeſs, That fanning the Coles, or lighting the Train, to Fire or blow up a Conventicle has been my particular Maſter-piece and Glory. I was ever a profeſt <hi>Nero</hi> at ſuch a Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Sung to my Fidle, as heartily, as that Illuſtious <hi>Roman</hi> to his Harp, at ſuch a Bonefire.
