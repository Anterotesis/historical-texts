            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN the midſt of our Diſmal Apprehenſions of a War, which had almoſt Unpeopl'd this Country, laid waſte its Tillage and Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, put an end to its Manufactures, (in a great meaſure) by transferring them to other Countries; in a word, a War which threatned the Ruine of the French Trade both at home and abroad, and which if the Confederates could have maintain'd but two years longer, in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97644:3"/>
would have reduc'd this Monarchy to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as low a Condition as that of <hi>Spain;</hi> I ſay, in the midſt of ſuch a frightful Proſpect, you will eaſily believe it is a moſt agreeable ſurpriſe to them, to find themſelves now (by the ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their Neighbours) already deliver'd from all theſe impendent Miſchiefs: For by the impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent haſte the Allies have made in the Diſcharge of their Troops, the French King hath the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of furniſhing himſelf with the beſt Foot that were ever yet known in the World, and is now at liberty to Employ his own Subjects in Tillage, Vineyards, and Manufactures, by which means, in a ſmall time, he may reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to Reſtore his Trade to its former flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing State: And if they are thus pleas'd with the happy Change oſ their Condition, you will give our Court leave to be no leſs Tranſported with the Accounts they have by the laſt Poſts of the preſent poſture of Affairs in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, I have long promis'd my ſelf, whenever a Peace ſhould be declar'd between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> our Court at <hi>St. Germains</hi> might by a prudent, and carefull Conduct, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit themſelves very much of the inveterate Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities between the two conteſting Parties for the Miniſtry there; And (thô they neither of them intend ſuch a Conſequence of their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel) that it might at ſome time happen, whilſt they are Playing for this Stake of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we may have a fair Game to Beaſt 'em Both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:97644:3"/>
But I muſt own, I did think this would have been a Work of more time; I did not imagine any thing like this could happen, before the French Troops were Disbanded, the Towns deliver'd up, or any other part of the Peace perform'd: But that part of it which hath already enabl'd the King of <hi>France</hi> to maintain another years War, if he ſhould ſo think fit, I mean, the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Trade with him. This is ſo Amazing a Management, That Thinking Men can ſcarce believe it other than a Dream: However, moſt of us are ſo eaſie to entertain every appearance of Hope, that this News hath occaſion'd a great Change in the Countenances of our Court: The King himſelf takes other Ayres upon him than he hath been ſeen to do of late; Is much in Whiſpers, with <hi>Mac—Fitz—</hi>and <hi>O—,</hi> which we here call a Cabinet; And the poor Queen, who upon the firſt Knowledge of the intended Peace, every Night, like King <hi>David, Water'd her Couch with her Tears,</hi> hath now reaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd the pointed Glories of her Eyes; appears all Gay, is always preſent at Balls, Plays, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Orders are given out for us to Liquor our Jack-Boots, Maſſes are ſaid day and night for our Succeſs; and we talk with Aſſurance, that we ſhall ſhortly have as quiet and unconteſted a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration as that in 1660: I own I cannot be Sanguine at this rate, for thô it gives great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to ſee a People impos'd upon ſo far by an Artificial Argument, as to believe Black
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97644:4"/>
is White, and in a Point upon which their All depends; yet I look-upon it only as a ſurpriſe, which will not be able to maintain the Ground it hath got, againſt a mature and deliberate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, the Antient Obſervers have left to us as a Proverb, <hi>That nothing Violent is Lasting:</hi> I know my Countrymen are apt to be ſurpriz'd into Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, but they grow more reaſonable upon think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as we found to our Coſts about Ten years ſince; and this would be ſo general a Ruin, that I fear there are too many concern'd to ſuffer it eaſily. And I ſhould fancy, it is impoſſible for them, (when they come ſoberly to Reflect upon their Danger from <hi>Le Hogue, Calais,</hi> the ſeveral De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barkments in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the <hi>P.</hi> of <hi>O.</hi>'s Deſcent, in every of which Caſes, the Engliſh were Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Sea) to believe themſelves ſafe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Land-Force, nor with any other Land-Force than Diſciplin'd Troops againſt Diſciplin'd Troops, certainly they cannot. The State of the Caſe, I take to be. That the old Deſigning K——s have found this way to make themſelves Courted by the Government, and have Trump'd up theſe Specious Fears and Jealouſies of Liberty, to draw in a ſort of Men, who wiſh better to their Intereſt, then they Judge of it, to ſtrengthen their Party; and I am apt to think, the real Conteſt is, a Struggle between the Two Contending Parties, which of them ſhall appear the moſt able and ſucceſsful in the Management of the preſent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument on foot, For and againſt an Army; and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97644:4"/>
conſequently which of them ſhall be eſteem'd moſt uſeful by their Maſters; for that any who are for the preſent Government (which I fear moſt of the People of <hi>England</hi> are) can be for no Army in their preſent Circumſtances, is Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to believe.</p>
            <p>However it is our part to improve this Occaſion to our Service as far as we can, and in order to this, the K. and Q. direct firſt, That you make all the Compliments imaginable from them to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Argument <hi>Againſt a Standing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, &amp;c.</hi> And (becauſe nothing can pleaſe him ſo much as to be thought Important) you are to tell him, They own all the Hopes they have of their Reſtauration to His Conduct, and to the moſt Eloquent Perſwaſion of his Book, That they ſhall always Treat him as their Redeemer, and that he ſhall not only be the <hi>Alb—l,</hi> but the <hi>Cl—n</hi> too of their Government: Their Supreme Miniſter both in Military and Civil Affairs, (as being equally Capable of both.) Perhaps you will think this Ridiculous, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it would be ſo to any other; but as to this Gentleman, believe me you cannot be too Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant, neither in your Praiſes of him, nor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to him: For as nothing is ſo Impoſſible, but that he will hope to make you believe it; ſo on the other hand, nothing is ſo Impoſſible neither, but you may make him believe, when it hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours his Vanity. However his malicious Wit, and indefatigable Induſtry to revenge himſelf of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97644:5"/>
his late Friends, may be of uſe to us, if pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently managed. But to that End let him write and act for us in a Mask, for I fancy his Credit is ſo low on every ſide, that he will never be able to do our Enemies any conſiderable Miſchief barefac'd; Flatter and Promiſe all his Friends too, without meaſure, from the <hi>S—ch</hi> Conjurer down to the little dirty School Boy; make 'em all Secretaries of State, or what elſe they have moſt fancy for. It is a cheap way of Liſting Auxiliaries; and Fools are more pleaſed with immenſe Hopes, than moderate Certainties.</p>
            <p>Let our Friends induſtriouſly ſollicit in the Court of <hi>Requeſts,</hi> Coffee, Chocolate Houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by being all Things to all Men, they will gain ſome.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Whigs who are State Phanaticks, and prefer the Popular Project of being againſt an Army, to the Real Safety of the People whom they pretend to Protect, you are to praiſe for their Steadineſs to their former Principles; clap them on the Back, and call them Brave <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> true <hi>Engliſhmen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The City you are to fright with that diſmal Havock that Laced Coats and Red Stockings will make amongſt their Wives and Daughters, for Women are provoked by the ſight of the Red to Love, as Turky Cocks are to Anges; and you are to tell 'em, It will be too hard for theſe <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamuffins in Red</hi> to run away with their Women, whilſt the <hi>D—cb</hi> on the other hand run away with their Trade.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:97644:5"/>
Make the Country Squires ſenſible of the moſt deplorable Havock theſe <hi>Robbers</hi> of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooſts</hi> will make amongſt the Poultry; how dear they will make Eggs: Tell 'em, how exactly theſe Diſciplined Troops have learned of the <hi>French</hi> to ſhoot flying; and that not a Partridge, Pheaſant, Woodcock, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will live in quiet for 'em, which perhaps may weigh more with ſome of them than a <hi>French</hi> Invaſion.</p>
            <p>Enrage the Clergy with Reminding them of the Decreaſe of their Dominion; tell 'em, That now the Sword of Juſtice walks into Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, not to Correct 'em, but to Compliment 'em. How can they bear to ſee all thoſe pleaſing and profitable Laws againſt Diſſenters laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep! Remember them of their old Maxim, <q rend="inline">"That it is better to have Papiſts govern, than Presbyterians."</q> And that they may not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend too much, that their Part in the late Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be remembred, tell 'em, That K. <hi>James</hi> hath often been heard to ſay, That thô indeed the Church of <hi>E—,</hi> like St. <hi>Peter,</hi> denied their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter upon the Pr—of <hi>O—</hi>'s coming over; yet, like that holy Saint too, they ſoon repented of it, and immediately went out and wept bitterly for it; and that ſome of them had ſufficiently Expiated for that Offence by Service ſince. Thô it proved not to have the Succeſs they in tended; and withall let 'em know, it is a Standing Rule in all wiſe Courts, That as one Diſſervice ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97644:6"/>
the Merit of a Thouſand paſt Services, ſo no paſt Injuries ſhall be remembred if you can ſerve a preſent Turn.</p>
            <p>Irritate all thoſe who came over with the Pr—of <hi>O—,</hi> and are unrewarded; Remind the Whigs of their being disbanded when there was no further uſe of them; It may prove a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable precedent for them to disband the Army; And as <hi>Timon</hi> of <hi>Athens</hi> ſays, <q rend="inline">"May they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Army, and then—."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Endeavour to make the People impatient of their Taxes, the <hi>Spartan</hi> Politicians jealous of their Liberties, and the Ladies ſenſible of the neglect of their Beauty, and what Gallantries they may expect from us who have been Bred ſo long in <hi>France.</hi> And now I name Ladies, Pray let Mrs. <hi>L—y</hi> lay hold upon the young <hi>M—rs,</hi> with her Troop of Catholick kind Beauties: We are told much of the Progreſs of her Arms, and that ſhe hath by a Detachement of her Troops, made two of their Grandees Priſoners: Thank her for her young Lord's Converſion, who Labours in our Intereſts more than ye all, and I hear his Labour of Love is not in vain amongſt the young Sparks of his acquaintance; but ſhe muſt take Care to manage him warily, for it is ſaid, That he hath all the K—ve of his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father without any of his Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Let ſome Apoſtles be ſent to Coffee Houſes to Preach up, and Argue for the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:97644:6"/>
Schemes of Government; for in our Caſe, <hi>The furtheſt way about will be the nearest way home,</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Proverb,) And it was upon this Point, that the Reſtauration was brought about in 1660; for if you can make my Countrymen out of their Wits one way, you may the more eaſily make 'em ſo any other way. Let our Friends Amuſe our Enemies, by not appearing violent againſt any Laws which forbid Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with K. <hi>J.</hi> and the return of <hi>Jacobites</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> nay not even againſt an Act of Abjurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for if we can by theſe Shadows of Security, prevail with them to Disband the Army, we ſhall ſoon be in a Condition to Disband thoſe Laws; and if by any of theſe Methods above mention'd, you find that ye gain Ground, we will then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what is next to be done; in the mean time I wiſh you good luck, and am,</p>

away all Jealouſies from the Engliſh, and to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm 'em in their Security; For the French wiſely conſider, That if by this means they can Advance the preſent Project on Foot amongſt the Engliſh, of a Militia; and that they can ſurprize them, while they are in this mad Fit, the Towns (were they twice as many) will quickly be their own again. I had forgot likewiſe to tell you, That you are to Adviſe our Friends, that they appear not too warm in publick Diſcourſe againſt Armies, it will allarm our Enemies, and awaken them out of their Lethargy, if they are not infatuated, to ſee declared <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſo concern'd for Engliſh Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and perhaps put them upon thinking that they have ſome other Motive which makes them ſo unkind to their old Miſtreſs, <hi>A Standing Army.</hi>
