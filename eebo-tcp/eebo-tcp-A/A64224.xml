            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>HOW admirably profitable the study of the Mathematicks hath been to these British Islands, and to all other parts of the Universe in which any kind of good Learning hath been esteemed and practised, is well known to all wise and judicious men. And indeed it is an undeniable truth, that among all humane Arts and Sciences whatsoever, the Noble Science Mathematical hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the greatest evidence of certainty, as being the Queen of Truth that imposeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on her Subjects but what she proves by most infallible Demonstrations.</p>
            <p>Now this prerogative results from the verity and perspicuity of its Principles, which consist of Definitions, Postulats and Axioms. Hence comes it to pass that all Propositions that are proved by those most infallible Precepts are called certain
<pb facs="tcp:40282:5"/>
demonstrative truths; for which cause it hath been the endeavour of sundry Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers to make the force of their Arguments (as far as the quality of their discourse woùld admit) amount unto Mathematical Demonstrations, as being the most convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing proof of a Proposition that by humane reasoning can be given.</p>
            <p>Now having for divers years (amongst my other Studies) been conversant in the study of the Mathematicks, and for my own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate use compiled this Treatise, never in the least intending it should have appeared in publick in this nice and critical Age; but it by chance falling into the hands of some of my Mathematical Friends and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I have at their requests condescended to publish it, though not without a great aversion in my own mind to expose my self in any publick thing.</p>
            <p>But this difficulty being overcome, I shall give the Impartial Reader to understand that I have faithfully compiled this Treatise from the best of Authors (and my own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience) that I have contracted their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Works into this little Cabinet or choice Compendium of the Mathematicks, in which thou shalt find the whole Subject clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and intelligibly handled: I have used a plain and easie method: I have laboured to
<pb facs="tcp:40282:5"/>
be as plain and perspicuous as possible: I have applied such Examples to each as may best demonstrate their Operation, be most easie for memory, and applicable to practice; here is indeed Multum in Parvo, the whole Marrow of the Mathematicks is in this Tract afforded thee, which is as a true and Golden Key to unlock the choicest mysteries in those Arts contained.</p>
            <p>Thus, Reader, I have laid my labours before thee, and must intreat thee to use me as thou wouldst be done by, which is the Spontaneous act of every good man.</p>
            <p>But if this shall chance to fall into the hands of any curious conceited person, who thinks himself wiser than the rest of the world, and so he beginneth enviously to carp hereat, and like a Countrey Cur bark at my backside, to him I shall in modesty onely say, — Facilius est unicuivis nostrum aliena curiosè observare: quam propria negotia rectè agere. 'Tis much easier for those captious Readers to carp than to copy.</p>
            <p>If the Collections of Authors shall offend any, and so procure the same censure with the Jackdaw, as our learned Poet hath long since cautioned against —</p>
            <p>Ne, si fortè suas repetitum venerit olim Grex avium plumas, moveat cornicularisum, Furtivis nudata coloribus.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40282:6"/>
            <p>I would have such contentious Readers know that I have robbed no man of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Works, but have given to each his due; only I have borrowed some choice things of them, which is no more than what the most learned have always done.</p>
            <p>Thus, Courteous and Impartial Reader, 'tis only for thee that I have taken these pains, and have submitted to the publication hereof, and it is to thee the future parts of my study shall be serviceable, hoping that thou wilt find success in all thy Studies accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy desire and endeavour; which are and shall be the hearty wishes of him who is</p>

            <p>BEing desired to peruse this Mathematical Treasury, accordingly to gratifie the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of my Friend I did, and I must confess with no small satisfaction to my self to see so much Practical Matter of usefull Mathematical Arts so neatly and compendiously digested into this Portable Volume; 'twill be usefull not only to Learners and meer Tyro's, but to others also who have made some considerable progress in these Studies. 'Tis well Methodiz'd, very Concise, yet Plain and Perspicuous, so that any person of a pregnant fancy, may without a Tutour (in some reasonable time) wade through the whole, or any part thereof, and such as would be more expeditious may take the assistance of a Teacher to instruct them.</p>
            <p>The Author is wholly a stranger to me, but to give him his due, in my opinion he has dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd himself like a Master in these Arts, and an Ingenious Mathematician, to whom I return thanks for this his generous offer in presenting his Mathematical Treasury to the Publick, and remain<note place="margin">From my House in Baldwin's Court in Baldwin's Gardens, over against the Old Hole in the Wall.</note>

               <l>To thee the Brooks and Springs do all submit,</l>

To operate this according to the Rule, I square the third Term 30, whose square is 900: then I multiply it by the second Term 3000, its product is 2700000, which divided by 2500, the square of the first Term 50, the Quotient is 1080, and so many Tiles will pave the lesser square, whose side is 30 feet.</p>

Examp. Admit an Iron Bullet whose diameter is 4 Inches, weigh 9 pounds; what is the weight of that Bullet whose Diameter is 6 Inches? Now to operate this proportion; first according to the Rule I Cube the third Term 6 whose Cube is 216, then I multiply its Cube by the second Term 9, the product is, 1944, which divided by 64, the Cube of the first Term; the Quotient is 30 24/64 pounds which is equal unto 30l. 6 ounces: which is the weight

Admit 20 and 50 to be the two numbers propounded: Now to operate this proposition, first according to the Rule, I find that the difference of the two given Terms 20, and 50, is 30, whose half is 15, which being added to the lesser Term 20, it makes 35, so is 35, a mean Arithmetical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion betwixt 20, and 50, given.</p>

                     <p>Example: If the Square root of 20736, were required, first they being wrote down in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as you see, draw the Crooked-line,<note n="*" place="margin">As you use to doe in Division to represent the Quotient.</note> then to prepare this or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther number for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, make a point over the place of Unites; and so on every other figure towards the Left-hand; as you see in the Margent.

So you see that these two Angles, are the Complements of each other, because they two are equal to a Quadrent or 90 Degrees.</p>
                     <p>Now the Logarithm of the Complement, may be exactly found with ease, for the Sines and Tangents of every degree, and Minute of the Quadrent in one Column is joyned with his Complement in the next Column, so that

                  <p>TRIGONOMETRY is necessary in most parts of the Mathematicks, and herein indeed consisteth the most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent use of the Logarithms, Sines, Tangents, and Secants: It is conversant in the measuring of Triangles, Plain or Spherical, comparing their Sides, and Angles together; according unto their known Analogies, or Proportions: So that any three parts of a Triangle being given, the other parts may be found out, and known: Now in the Doctrine of Right-lined Triangles, it will be necessary to know these Maxims fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:40282:41"/>
                  <p n="1">1. That a Right-lined Triangle, is a Figure constituted, by the Conjunction, or Intersection, of the three Right, or Streight-lines thereof; in their Angles or Meeting-places. So that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Triangle hath six distinct parts, Viz. Three Sides, and three Angles.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That all Right-lined Triangles, are either<note place="margin">Fig. 34.</note> Right-angled, That is, which hath one Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Angle, as ABC Fig. 34. Or Oblique-angled, whose three Angles are all Acute; that is, less than a Quadrant, or 90 deg; or else they have One Angle Obtuse, or greater than a Quadrent: So all Triangles, that have not one Right-angle,<note place="margin">Fig. 36.</note> are called Oblique-Triangles; as Fig. 36. to wit, the Triangle ABC.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the three Angles, of any Right-lined Triangle, are equal unto two Right-angles; or 180 Degrees. So that any two of their Angles being known, the third Angle is also found, being the Complement of the other two; unto 180 Degrees: But this is more readily found in a Rectangled Triangle, for the Rectangle being a Quadrent, or 90 degrees, one of the acute Angles therefore being given, the other is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily known, being the Complement thereof unto 90 Degrees.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 That the three sides, comprehending the<note place="margin">Fig. 35.</note> Triangle, some call Leggs, others Sides, but in Rectangled Triangles, as in the Triangle ABC, I call AB, the Base, BC the Cathetus or Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; and AC the Hypothenuse.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That the Sines, of the Angles are proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal unto their opposite Sides; and their Sides, to their opposite Angles. So that if the Side of a Triangle were desired, put the Sine of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40282:41"/>
Angle in the first place. Also if an Angle be required, put the Logarithm of his opposite side in the first place.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That the sides of any Rectangled Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle may be measured by any Scale of equal parts, as Inches, Feet, Yards, Poles, Miles, Leagues, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That if an Angle propounded, be greater than 90 deg. and so not to be found in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, take the Complement thereof, unto 180 deg. and work by the Sine, or Tangent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the work will be the same.</p>
                  <p>And here for the more short, and speedy performance of these conclusions in Trigono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry; I have annexed, and used, these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Symbols; which I would have you take notice of.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, having thus found the Angles, the<note place="margin">Fig. 36.</note> two unknown sides, may be found by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion they bear to their opposite Angles, for that proportion holds also in these; thus to find the side BC, this is the analogy or proportion.</p>
                     <p>As S. V. C 37° 00',</p>
                     <p>To Log. side AB 30 parts.</p>

                     <p>To Log. side BC 38 19/100 parts required to be found.</p>
                     <p>But it may be more readily found, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in such case as this, where you have a Sine, or Tangent, in the first place, by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetical Complement thereof, and so save the Substraction.</p>

                     <p>Now the readiest way to find the Arithmetical<note place="margin">☞ The Rule to find the Complement Arithmeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, of any Logarithm Number.</note> Complement is that of Mr. Norwood, in his Doctrine of Triangles; which is thus: begin with the first Figure towards the left hand of any Number and write down the Complement, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder thereof, unto 9:<note place="margin">9. 962398.</note> And so do with all the<note place="margin">0. 037602.</note> rest of the Figures, as you see here done. Saying 9, wants of 9, 0: and again 9, wants 0: 6, wants 3; 2, wants 7: 3, wants 6; 9, wants 0: only when you come to the last Figure to the right hand, take it out of 10, so 8, wants 2; of 10: Thus you may readily find the Co-Ar. of any Sine, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as soon as the Sine it self.</p>
                     <p>But if you want the Complement Arithmetical of any Tangent, you may take the Co-tang. which is exactly the Co-Arith. of the double Radius, so that the Tangent, and Co-tangent, of an Arch makes exactly 20. 000000.</p>
                     <p>Now if the Radius be in the first place, then there is no need of taking the Co-Arith. of the first Number, only you must cut off, the first I, to the left hand thus X, and you will have the Logarithm of the Number desired.</p>

                     <item>2. A Continent is a great Quantity of Land not separated, interlaced or divided by the Sea, wherein are Kingdoms, Principalities and Nations, as EUROPE, ASIA and AFRICA, are one Continent: and AMERICA is another.</item>
                     <item>3. An Island is such a part of the Earth that is environed round with Water on every Side, as the Isle of Great Britain, Java, Wight, &amp;c.</item>
                     <item>4. A Peninsula is such a Tract of Land which being almost cut off from the Main Land, and encompassed round with Water, yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less is joyned unto the firm Land, by some little Isthmus, as Peloponesus, Peruviana, Taurica, Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryca and Morea in the Levant.</item>

                     <item>6. A Promontory is some high Mountain, which shooteth it self into the Sea, the utmost end of which is called a Cape: as Cape-boon, Esperance, Cape d'Verde, and Cape d'Coquibocao.</item>
                     <item>7. The Ocean is a general Collection of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which environeth the World on every side, and produceth Seas, Straits, Bays, Lakes, and Rivers: Of which and other Waters Ovid thus speaks in his Metamorphosis.

                     <item>9. A Strait is a part of the Ocean restrained within narrow bounds, yet openeth a way to the Sea, as the Straits of Gibralter, Helespont, &amp;c</item>
                     <item>10. A Creek is a crooked Shoar thrusting, as. it were, two Armes forth to hold the Sea; as the Adriatick, Persian, and Corinthian Creeks: from whence are produced Rivers, Brooks and Fountains: which are engendred of Congealed Air in the Earths Concavity, and seconded by Sea-water creeping through the hidden Cranies of the Earth.</item>
                     <item>11. A Bay is a great Inlet of Land, as the Bay of Mexico, and Biscay.</item>
                     <item>12. A Gulph is a greater Inlet of Land and

deeper than a Bay, as the Gulph of Venice, and Florida.</item>
                     <item>13. A Climate is a certain space of Earth and Sea, included within the space of two Parallels; and there have been anciently accounted these seven: viz. 1. Dia Meros, 2. Dia Syenes, 3. Dia Alexandria, 4. Dia Rhodes, 5. Dia Rhomes, 6. Dia Boristhenes, and 7. Dia Ripheos.</item>
                     <item>14. A Zone is a certain space of Earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained betwixt certain Circles of the Sphere, of which there are five: viz. The Torrid or Burning Zone, two Temperate, and two Frigid or Frozen Zones.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The Torrid Zone is that which lieth on each side the Equinoctial, whose bounds are the two Tropicks of ♋ and ♑.</p>
                  <p>The two Temperate Zones are those which lieth betwixt the two Tropicks of ♋ and ♑, and the Palar Circles.</p>
                  <p>The two Frigid Zones lieth between the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and Antartick Circles, and their respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Poles: Of which Ovid thus speaks.</p>

First, they circumcise their Children both Males

Eleventhly, they teach the Reasonable Soul of Man comes by Seminal Propagation. Twelfthly, that Infants dying unbaptized are saved, being sanctifyed by the Eucharist in the Womb, and finally they produce a Book of Eight Volumes, writ as they say by the Apostles at Jerulalem for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, the Contents whereof they observe most solemnly, and thus they differ from the Papists.</p>

                     <p>When first the Spaniards had entred on A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica they found the people without Apparel, and their Bread was made of the Jucca-Root, whose Juice is a strong poyson: but it being squeezed out and dried it makes Bread. They worshipped Devillish Spirits, which they call Zema; in remembrance of which they keep Images made of Cotton Wool, to which they did great reverence, supposing the Spirits of their Gods were there; and to blind them the more, the Devil would cause these Puppets to seem to move and to make a noise, so that they feared them so greatly that they durst not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them; which if they did, then the Devil would come and destroy their Children.

So natural is the knowledge of the Soul's Immortality, and of some Ubi, for its future reception, that we find some tract of it in the most Barbarous Nations. The Americans were of a fair and clear Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion.

                        <item>2. When both Places are towards one of the Poles, then the Meridional parts of the lesser, taken from the Meridional parts of the greater Latitude, the remainder is the Meridional dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference required.</item>

When one Place hath North, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther South Latitude, their corresponding Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridional parts added together gives the Meridio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal difference of Latitude sought: thus having sound them out they may thus be applyed.</item>

                  <p>THIS is of all other the most exact way of sailing, and above all other most perfect, shewing the nearest way, and distance between any two Places: and although it is hardly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to keep close unto the Arch of a great Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, yet it is of great advantage to keep conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently near it, especially in an East or West
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:40282:121"/>
Course: In the former Propositions of sailing, we used Meridians, Parallels and Rumbs, as the Sides of every Triangle, whether by the Plain or Mercator's Chart: but in Circular sailing the Rumbs are not used so, because they are Helis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherical-lines, and not Circles; nor the Parallels, because they are not great Circles: Whereas the sides comprehending every Spherical Triangle are Arches of great Circles: Therefore here we use Arches of the Meridians, of the Equinoctial, and of other great Circles described, or so ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined to be described, from one Place unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, on the Spherical Superficies of the Earth and Sea.</p>
                  <p>Therefore here ariseth two things observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. If the two places lie under the Equinoctial, then is their Position East and West, and their distance is their Difference of Longitude, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into Miles: or,</item>
                     <item>2. If the two Places proposed be in one and the same Meridian, then is their Position North and South, and their Distance is their Difference of Latitude converted into Miles.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>And thus far doth Circular sailing agree with the former; their difference will evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by these following Propositions.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. Of SURVEYING.</head>
               <p>IT hath been a custom among Modern Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, that have treated on this Subject, that before they entred on the Work it self, to give the Description of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, used in; and chiefly appertaining to the Art of Surveying: viz. the Circumferentor, the Theodolite, the Plain-Table, and the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle: concerning the descriptions of which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments I shall not here treat, but refer you unto those Authors that have largely and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply described them. I shall in this place onely demonstrate the Use of the Semicircle in taking the Plots of Enclosures, Champain-Plains, Woods and Mountains divers ways<note n="*" place="margin">Which Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Plain Table, I esteem as the two aptest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments for Survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Land; i. e. the Plain Table for small En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closures, and the Semicircle for Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pain Plains, Woods, and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</note>; and also in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Accessible, and Inaccessible Heights and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; and also I shall shew the use of a little Instrument called a Protractor, in the delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on Paper the Plot of a Field, &amp;c. which Instrument being so commonly known, and so generally used makes me omit the description thereof as superfluous.</p>

               <p>As for your Chain, I would have you, have it made of good round Wyre; to contain in length four Poles, or Perch, to be divided into an hundred equal parts called Links.</p>
               <p>And here before we enter on the Work it self, it will be necessary to understand how by the Protractor to lay down an Angle of any quantity of degrees propounded, or to find the quantity of an Angle given.</p>

Q, and P, and placed Marks in all the Angles: Then place your Semicircle at Q, and there<note place="margin">Fig. 55.</note> six it with the Needle hanging over the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of the Chart, represented by R, Q, X, and direct your sights unto all the visible Angles, viz.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:40282:131"/>
A, B, C, D, E, and F, and note down the Quantity of each Angle in your Field-book: Then measure with your Chain from your Station Q, to the Angles A, B, C, D, E, and F, and their length so found, note down in your Field-book also.<note place="margin">Fig. 55.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>This done direct your sight unto your second Station P, and note down in your Field-book the degree of Declination, of your second-station P, from the Meridian. Then measure the Stationary Distance PQ with your Chain, and note it down in your Field-book also.</p>
                     <p>Then remove the Instrument unto P, your second-station, and there fix it with the Needle hanging over the Meridian line of the Chart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented by TPB, then direct your sights to the several visible Angles at this second Station, viz. F, G, H, I, and K, in order one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and note down the Quantity of each An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle in your Field-book: Then with your Chain measure from your Station P, to these several Angles G, H, I, and K, (in all respects as at the first station Q.) and their length so found note down in your Field-book likewise: So have you finished your Observation, and your work stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thus.<note place="margin">Fig. 55.</note>

                  <head>SECT. V. How to find whether Water may be conveyed from a Spring-Head unto any appointed Place.</head>
                  <p>THE Art of conveying of Water from a Spring-Head unto any appointed Place, hath a special respect unto measuring, and therefore I think it not amiss to assert it in this place, and enroll it under the Title of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying.</p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:40282:142"/>
                  <p>In the performance of which we make use of a Water-level, the Construction and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king whereof is sufficiently known to those who make Mathematical Instruments: Now if it were required to find whether Water may be conveyed in Pipes, &amp;c. to any Place assigned: to perform which observe these Rules.</p>
                  <p>First at some 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, or 100 yards distant from the Spring-head in a right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line towards the Place unto which your Water is to be conveyed. Place your Water-level, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepared of two Station Staves with move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Vanes on each of them, graduated also af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the usual Manner: Cause your first Assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to set up one of them at the Spring-Head; Perpendicular unto the Horizon, and your second Assistant to erect another, as far from your Water-level towards the Place to which the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is to be conveyed, as your Water-level is distant from the Spring-head: Now the Station<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staves in this order erected, and your Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>level placed precisely Horizontal, go unto the end of the Level, and looking through the sights, cause your first Assistant to move a Leaf of Paper, up or down your Station staff, untill through the sights you espy the very edge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and then by some known sign or sound, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate to your Assistant that the Paper is then in its true position, then let the first Assistant note against what Number of Feet, Inches, and parts of an Inch the edge of the Paper resteth; which he must note down in a Paper. Then your Water-level remaining immoveable, go to the other end thereof, and looking through the sights towards your other Station-staff, cause
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:40282:142"/>
your second Assistant to move a Leaf of Paper along the Staff, till you see the very edge thereof through the sights, and then cause him by some known sign or sound, to take notice what number of Feet, &amp;c. are cut by the said Paper, which let him keep, as your first Assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant did.</p>
                  <p>This done let your first Assistant bring his Station-staff from the Spring-head, and cause your second Assistant to take that Staff, and carry it forwards towards the Place, unto which the Water is to be conveyed; some 30, 40, 60, or 100 yards, and there to erect it Perpendicular as before, letting your second Assistant's staff stand immoveable, and your first Assistant to stand by it: Then in the Midway between your two Assistants, place your Water-level exactly Horizontal, and looking through the sights thereof, cause your first Assistant, and after that your second, to make their several observations in all respects as before.</p>
                  <p>In this manner you must go along from the Spring-head, to the place unto which you would have the Water conveyed, and if there be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so many several Stations, you must in all of them observe this manner of work precisely; so that by comparing the notes of your two Assistants together, you may easily know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Water may be conveyed from the Spring-head, or not, by calling your two Assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants together, and causing them to give in their notes of observation at each Station, which add together severally: Then if the Notes of the second Assistant, exceed the Notes of the first Assistant, take the lesser out of the greater, and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:40282:143"/>
the remainder will shew you how much the appointed Place, to which the Water is to be conveyed, is lower than the Spring-head.</p>

                  <p>By these two Tables you may perceive that the Notes of the first Assistant collected at his several Stations, being added together, amounts unto 18 Feet, 10 Inches, and 75/100 or ¾ of an Inch: and the Notes of your second Assistant collected at his several Stations, amounts unto 21 Feet, 2 Inches: So that the number of the first Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant's Observations, being taken from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond's, there will remain 2 Feet, 3 Inches, and 25/100 or ¼ of an Inch. And so much is the place unto which the Water is to be brought, lower than the Spring-Head, according to the sleight Water-Level, and therefore the Water may easily be conveyed thither. And here observe these Notes.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. That if the Notes of your first Assistant, exceed the Notes of the second Assistant, then 'tis impossible to bring the Water from that Spring-head unto the appointed place, but if their Notes are equal, it may be done, if the distance be but short.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the most approved Authors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this particular do aver, that at every Mile's end there ought to be allowed 4½ Inches more than the Streight-level, for the current of the Water.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That if there be any Mountains lying in the way betwixt the Spring-head and the Place to which the Water is to be conveyed, you must then cut a Trench by the side of the Mountain, in which you must lay your Pipes equal with the streight Water-level, with the former allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: and in case there be a Valley, you must then make a Trunk of strong wood, well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-propped with strong pieces of Timber, well Pitched, or Leaded, as is done in divers places between Ware and London.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That when the Spring will have too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a Current, you must then convey your Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the place assigned, by a Crooked or Winding line, and you also ought to lay the Pipes, the one up, and the other down, that thereby the Violence of the Current may be stopped.</p>

Now the Demonstrative de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineation of Dials, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth chiefly in the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Hour-lines, and their true distance one from the other: which lines are great Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of a Sphere, which being projected on a plain Superficies, become streight-lines; which lines do continually va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, according as the Planes on which they are descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, or projected, do lie situated in respect of the Horizon of the Place.

Now a Dial may be made on any Plain Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies, for all Plain Superficies are Posited either Perpendicular, Parallel, or Oblique, to the Horizon of the Place, in which the Plane is seated.</p>
               <p>In the delineation of all which Dials in this Chapter described, (which are the most Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and usefull Dials now used) I have used this Method: First, I have shewed how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineate them by Geometrical Projection, by Scale, and Compass only: and secondly how they may be described by Arithmetical Calculation, of both which I have been very plain and large.</p>

                     <head>PROP. VI. How to draw the Hour-lines, on an Erect declining Plane.</head>
                     <p>These Planes are made to set on the sides of Houses, wherein the Meridian is always a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular,<note place="margin">Fig. 71.</note> drawn on the Plane, in whose top is the Center, where the Substile, and the Hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines all meet.</p>
                     <p>Now before we can delineate the Hour-lines on any such Planes, two things must be given: As the Latitude of the Place, and the Planes De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination; by having which we must find these three things: viz. The Poles height above the Plane. The distance of the substile from the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian. And the Plane's difference of Longitude.</p>
                     <p>For the finding of which Requisites, by Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical Projection, we describe on the Dial Plane, these Circles of the Sphere, viz. The Horizon, Meridian, and Equinoctial, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing described in their true Position, on the Plane, we proceed thus.<note place="margin">Fig. 71.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Admit it be required to make a Direct South Dial, on an Erect, Direct South Plane, Declining Westward 24° 20', in the Latitude of 51° 32'.</p>
                     <p>Now in order to find the requisites before mentioned, describe the Circle ZHNO, and cross it with the two Diameters ZQN, and H QO: now Z is the Zenith, N the Nadir, ZQN the Hour-line of 12, HQO the Horizon. Now seeing the Plane declines S. W. 34° 20': make Na, and Ob, each equal to 34 20: Then a Ruler layed from Z, to a, will cut the Horizon in S, the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:40282:158"/>
South point of the Horizon, through which draw the Meridian ZSN, whose Center is at Y, found as in the fourth Proposition aforegoing: Then a Ruler laid from Z to b, will cut the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon in W, the West point thereof. Now the Horizon and the Meridian being projected on the Plane, take out of your line of Chords 51° 32', which place from H, unto c, and from N, unto d; then lay a Ruler from W, unto c, and it cutteth the Meridian in P, the Pole of the World. Then through P and Q,<note place="margin">Fig. 71.</note> draw the line PQD, which representeth the Axis of the World, and the Substilar line of the Dial, then lay a Ruler from W, to d, it cutteth the Meridian in AE, so is W AE two points through which the Equinoctial must pass, whose Center is found as afore to be at M, (being always in the Axis of the World) so have you on your Plane the Horizon HQO, the Meridian ZPSAe N, and the Equinoctial LAeKWG, described on the Plane as required.</p>
                     <p>Now first to find the Poles height above the Plane, which in this Scheme is represented by BP, Lay a Ruler from G, unto P, and it shall cut the Plane in V, then measure the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance BV, on your line of Chords, and you<note place="margin">Fig. 71.</note> will find it to contain 34° 33', which is the Poles height above the Plane.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, To find the distance of the Substile from the Meridian represented in the Scheme by the Arch ZB, or ND, which measured as afore will appear to be 18° 08', the distance of the Substile from the Meridian.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, To find the Plane's Difference of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude, which in the Scheme is represented by
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:40282:159"/>
the Angle AEPK, lay a Ruler from P, unto AE, and it cutteth the Plane in X, then measure the Arch DX, as afore, and so will you find the Planes Difference of Longitude, to be 30° 00': Thus by Geometrical Projection have we found<note place="margin">Fig. 71.</note> all the three Requisites: Now to find them by Arithmetical Calculation observe these Analogies or Proportions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For the Poles height above the Plane, say,</p>
                     <p>As Radius or S. 90°,</p>
                     <p>To Sc. of the Latitude 38° 28'.</p>
                     <p>So is Sc. of the Declination 65° 40',</p>
                     <p>To S. of the Poles height above the Plane 34° 33'.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For the Distance of the Substile, from the Meridian, say,</p>
                     <p>As the Radius or S. 90° 00',</p>
                     <p>To the S. of the Plane's Declination 24° 20'.</p>
                     <p>So is Tc. of the Latitude 38° 28',</p>
                     <p>To the T. of the Substilar Distance from the Meridian 18° 10'.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For the Plane's Difference of Longitude, say,</p>
                     <p>As the Sc. of the Latitude 38° 28',<note place="margin">Fig. 71.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>To the Radius or S. 90° 00'.</p>
                     <p>So is S. of the Substilar Distance 18° 10',</p>
                     <p>To the S. of the Difference of Longitude 30 Deg.</p>
                     <p>Or, it may be found thus.</p>
                     <p>As the S. of the Latitude,</p>
                     <p>To the Radius.</p>
                     <p>So is the T. of the Declination,</p>
                     <p>To the T. of the Difference of Longitude requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                     <pb n="269" facs="tcp:40282:159"/>
                     <p>These things found, we come now to shew how the Hour-lines may be projected. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which observe, First, to lay a Ruler from P the Pole of the World, to AE the Intersection of<note place="margin">Fig. 71.</note> the Equinoctial with the Meridian, and it will cut the Plane in x, where begin to divide the Semicircle L x G, into 12 Equal parts in the Points •, •, •, •, &amp;c. Then lay a Ruler from Q, to every of those parts, and it shall cut the Equinoctial; and divide it into 12 unequal parts, in the points *, *, *, *, &amp;c. Then a Ruler laid from P the Pole of the World unto each of these points, it will divide the Plane into 12 unequal parts in the Points I, I, I, I, &amp;c. Then by a Ruler laid from the Center Q, to those points, draw right lines, which shall be the true Hour-lines proper unto such a Declining Plane, as you see plainly demonstrated by the Scheme.</p>
                     <p>Now the Substilar line falleth in this Dial, just on the Hour-line of 2, in the Afternoon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Plane declineth Westerly. The Angle of the Stile is DQR 34° 33'. which may be either a Plate or Wyre, brought into such an Angle, which must be placed Perpendicular to the Plane, and directly over the Substilar line QD 2.</p>
                     <p>Now the distance of the Hour-lines, from the Substilar line, may also be found by this Analogy or Proportion.</p>
                     <p>As the Radius,<note place="margin">Fig. 71.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>To the S. height of the Pole above the Plane.</p>
                     <p>So is the T. of the Hour-line from the Meridian of the Plane,</p>
                     <p>To the T. of the Hour-line from the Substile.</p>
                     <pb n="270" facs="tcp:40282:160"/>
                     <p>Thus have you compleated your Dial; as you see in the Scheme, and here you may take notice that having finished a West Decliner, you have also made an East Decliner; if you only convert the Hour-lines of the West Decliner, in such manner as you see in Fig. 72. on the East<note place="margin">Fig. 72.</note> Decliner, and compleat all as you see in that Scheme.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have explained the making and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineating of the best and most usefull Dials both by Geometrical Projection, and also by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetical Calculations, in as brief and compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious a manner as possible. There are sundry other kind of Dials, as Incliners, Decliners, and Recliners, which being not so usefull, for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity sake, they are here omitted: As for Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Dials, as Quadrants, Rings, Cylinders, &amp;c. Which depend on the Sun's height, I refer you to Mr. Edm. Gunter's Book, wherein they are largely described.</p>
                     <p>As for the Beautifying and Adorning of those Dials, &amp;c. by describing on them the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial, Tropicks, Parallels of Declination, Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels of the Sun's Place, Length of Days, the Sun's Rising and Setting, Jewish, Italian, and Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Hours, Almicanthars, Azimuths, Circles of Position, the Signs Right Ascending, Descending, Culminating, &amp;c. I do advise you to consult Mr. Gunter, Mr. Foster, Mr. Wells, and Mr. Holwel's Works, all which Authors have very learnedly shewed the describing of them, by several large Schemes, and Figures, for the plainer Illustration thereof.</p>

I have therefore hereunto annexed a Table of the Latitudes of all the principal Cities, Towns, and Islands, in and about Great Britain and Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; so that if you are to make a Dial, for any of those parts, you may have recourse to this Table, and make your Dial to the Latitude of that place, which you find to be the nearest to the Place, for which you are to make your Dial.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. Of FORTIFICATION.</head>
               <p>THE Utility of this Mathematical Art called Fortification, or Military Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, is so well known, that it needs not my commendation, and therefore to speak any thing thereto, were but to light a Candle before the Sun.</p>
               <p>In the handling of this part of the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, I shall be as brief as possible, yet as plain as can be desired: In the prosecution of which, I shall use this Method. As First, I shall give you the most principal Definitions or Terms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to this Art. Secondly, I shall prescribe the most conducing Maxims or Rules herein observed. Thirdly, I shall shew how to deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the Ground-line of any Fortification, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the several Proportions, used by the best and most experienc'd Inginiers of Italy, France, Holland and England; Fourthly, I shall describe the Construction of the chief and principal Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works now in use; and Lastly, lay down some general Maxims or Rules, by most Modern Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors observed in Irregular Fortifications.</p>

                     <item>1. THE Exterior or outward Line, which<note place="margin">Defin.</note> boundeth the Rampart, at the Foot next the Ditch, is the principal and only Line to be regarded <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

                     <item>2. The Exterior Polygon, is the outward side of any Regular Figure, as in the Hexagon (which Figure I shall make use of through this Tract) the side AA, is the Exterior Polygon.<note place="margin">Fig. 73.</note>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. The Interior Polygon, is the inward side of any Regular Figure, as in the Hexagon is noted by any of the sides between P and P.</item>
                     <item>4. The Bastion or Bulwork, is that great work of any Fort, that advanceth its self towards the Campaigne, and here are six all marked with B, the lines which terminate them, are two Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, two Flanks, and two Faces.<note place="margin">Fig. 73.</note>
                     </item>
                     <item>5. The Demi-Gorge or Gorge-line PC, is half the Entrance into the Bastion, and terminates the point C, whereby the Flank shall be raised.</item>
                     <item>6 The Flank is another Out-line of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion as CF, which terminateth the Curtain, and Face.</item>

                     <item>7. The Face is the utmost line of the Bastion, as FA, two lines thereof doth form the Angle of the Bastion A, or the Flanked Angle.</item>
                     <item>8. The line forming the Flank FF, is a prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed line, made use of by the Dutch Inginiers, and others.</item>
                     <item>9. The Capital is AP, part of the line com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Fig. 73.</note> from the Center ☉, terminated at the point of the Bastion A.</item>
                     <item>10. The Curtain is that part of the Interior Polygon CC, which lieth betwixt the two Basti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons B, and B.</item>
                     <item>11. The line of Defence is AC, passing from A, the point of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, to C the Angle of<note place="margin">Fig. 73.</note> the Flank, and Curtain, and ought never to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed 800 English Feet<note n="*" place="margin">Because the length of the part of a Musket doth not much exceed that Mèasure.</note>.</item>
                     <item>12. The line Stringent, is the line coming from the point of the Bastion A, and prolonged on the Face AF, to the Curtain D, which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that DC, the part of the Curtain, (by some called the second Flank will scour the Face.</item>
                     <item>13. The Diameter of the Interior Polygon, is the line ☉P, coming from the Center thereof ☉.</item>
                     <item>14. The shortest line from the Center unto the Curtain, is ☉ m. These are the Definitions of the principal lines, appertaining to the Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of any Regular Fortification, the Angles followeth.</item>
                     <item>15. The Angle of the Center of the Polygon<note place="margin">Fig. 73.</note> is P☉P</item>
                     <item>16. The Angle of the Polygon PPP, is always the Complement of the Angle at the Center, or remainer unto 180 Degrees.</item>

                     <item>17. The Angle of the Triangle PPO is always the one half of the Angle of the Polygon PPP.</item>
                     <item>18. The Angle of the Bastion, or the Flanked Angle FAF, is exposed unto the Batteries of the<note place="margin">Fig. 73.</note> Besiegers, and formed by the two Faces, FA, and FA, which ought never to be less than 60, nor much above 100 Degrees.</item>
                     <item>19. The Angle of the Espaule, or Shoulder, is formed by the Face, and Flank, as AFC.</item>
                     <item>20. The Angle of the Flank CCF, is formed by the Curtain, and the Flank, and is most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a Right Angle, but by some later Ingi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers, is made Obtuse, or more than a Right Angle, or 90 Degrees.</item>
                     <item>21. The Angle made by the two lines Sitchant, At A is called the Angle of the Tenaile.</item>
                     <item>22. The Angle forming the Flank, is CPF, which Angle is made use of by most of the Dutch Inginiers.<note place="margin">Fig. 73.</note>

That the Angle of the Bastion, or Flanked Angle, be not much above 90, nor much less than 60 Degrees, for in the former it would lie too very Obtuse, and open, at the Point; and in the latter it would be too slender, and so easily to be battered down, by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Cannon.</item>

                  <p>IRregular Fortifications is when any Town or Place is to be fortified, which lieth in an Irregular form; i. e. whose Sides and Angles are unequal in the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of Irregular Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures<note n="*" place="margin">The Inginier must first form a Map of the Town or Place, with all the Ways, Passages, Old Walls, Rivers, Pools, Enclosures, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters fit to be known in the draught, and then he is to design what Works he findeth most agreeing to the place to be Fortified.</note>. I shall here say very little, only I shall lay down some Precepts that are of immediate concern in fortifying of Irregular Figures, and shall refer you to peruse Marlois, Dogen, Fritach, Taurnier, Dilichius, &amp;c. which will greatly satisfie and help you: To this end know,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the same Laws and Maxims for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Fortifications stand and be in force for Irregular; i. e. that the line of Defence must not exceed the Port of a Musquet, nor the Angles of the Bastion be less than 60°, nor much above 90°, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That no inward Angle of the Place be less than 90°, if it be so it must be altered, and that point may be made the outward point of a Bastion.</p>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:40282:176"/>
                  <p n="3">3. That between Regular and Irregular For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, there is no other difference, but by rectifying the sides that are too short, or too long, and altering the Angles that are too little; as for the sides, if they be above 500, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 1000 Feet, they may be fortified by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions placed according to the usual manner, at the extreme points thereof; But if the sides be between 1000 and 1700 Feet, then in the midst you may place a Plat Bastion, and at the Extreme Points, place two Bastions, as before: But if the line be less than 500 Feet, you may lengthen it, by producing it into the Plane: As for the Angles, they are made greater or lesser according as occasion requireth. For the Raising the Rampires, Parapets, and other Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, they are to be as in the Regular, and the Out-work may be placed before the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains as was before mentioned.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the Capital, in any Regular or Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Bastion, is found by dividing the Angle of the Polygon into two equal parts (by prop. 7. §. 1. chap. 4.) and by producing the line of Angular Division or Separation, on which the due length of the Capital must be placed, which observe for a general Rule.</p>

                     <head>PROP. I. How to know the different Fortification of a Piece of Ordnance.</head>
                     <p>In fortifying any Piece of Ordnance there are three degrees observed, as first Legitimate Pieces, which are those that are ordinarily fortified; secondly Bastard Pieces, which are such whose Fortification is lessened; thirdly Double fortified Pieces, or extraordinary Pieces.</p>
                     <p>The Fortification of any Piece of Ordnance, is accounted by the thickness of the Metal at the Touch-hole, Trunnions, and at the Muzzel, in proportion to the Diameter of the Bore.</p>
                     <p>The Legitimate Pieces, or the ordinary fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Cannons, have ⅞ at the Touch hole, ⅝ at the Trunnions, and ⅜ at the Muzzel of the thickness of the bore, in thickness of Metal. Bastard Cannons, or lesned Cannons, have ¾ at their Touch-hole, or 12/16, and 9/16 at their Trunnions, and 7/16 at their Muzzel: the Double fortified Cannons have full one Diameter of the Bore in thickness of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal at the Touch-hole, and 11/16 at the Trunnions; and 7/16 at their Muzzel. Now all double fortified Culverins, &amp;c. are 1 ⅛ at the Touch-hole, 15/16 at the Trunnions, and 9/16 at the Muzzel, and the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary fortified Culverins, are fortified every way as double fortified Cannons, and lesned Culverins as Ordinary Cannons in all respects.</p>

                     <head>PROP. II. How to know how much Powder is fit for proof, and what for service, for any Piece of Ordnance.</head>
                     <p>For Cannons take ⅘ of the weight of their Iron Bullet of good Corn Powder for Proof, and for service ½ the weight of the Iron Bullet is sufficient, especially for Iron Ordnance, which will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure so much Powder, as Brass ones will receive by ¼ in Weight, for Culverins allow the whole Weight of the Shoot for Proof, and ⅔ for Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. For Sakers, and Falcons, take ⅘ of the Weight of the Shoot, and for lesser Pieces the whole weight may be used in service, untill they grow hot, but then there must be some abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made at discretion, and take 1 ⅓ of the weight of their Iron Bullet for Proof.</p>

                     <p>The Bullet must be somewhat less than the Bore of the Gun, that so it may have vent in the discharge, some Authors affirm ¼ of an Inch less than the Bore will serve, all Ordnance, but this vent is too much for a Falcon, &amp;c. and too little for a Cannon: therefore I approve them not, but commend Mr. Phillipes's proportion<note n="*" place="margin">In his Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Manual.</note> to your Use, which is to divide the Bore of the Gun into 20 equal parts; and let the Diameter of the Bullet be 19/20 thereof, according to which<note place="margin">page 165.</note> proportion the precedent Table is calculated.</p>

                        <p>This Table is most agreeing to Cannons, and Culverins; and the greatest sort of Ordnance, the Use thereof is thus.</p>
                        <p>Admit a Saker to be mounted to 3 deg. shoots the Bullet 323 Paces, how far will it shoot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mounted unto 7 deg. Say (by prop. 1. chap. 1.)</p>
                        <p>As 510 the Tabular distance for 3 deg. of Mounture, to 323, the distance found,</p>
                        <p>So is 934 the Tabular distance for 7 deg. of Mounture, to 591 272/510, the distance required, which the Saker according to this Experiment shall shoot at 7 deg. of Mounture.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NYE in his Book of Gunnery printed Anno, 1647, saith he made an Experiment by a Saker of 8 Feet long, which he loaded with three pounds of Powder, of an exact weight, both Powder and Wad at every charge, every time ramming it down with three equal stroaks, as near as possible; but on the Bullet he put no Wad, because the Saker was mounted; And thus he made four Shoots, each of them half an Hour after the other, that so the Piece might be of equal temper, and mounted his Piece to these 4 degrees of Mounture, viz. 1 deg. 5 deg. 7 deg. 10 deg. and found these Randoms.</p>
                        <p>At 1 Deg. the Random was 225 Paces.</p>
                        <p>At 5 Deg. the Random was 416 Paces.</p>
                        <p>At 7 Deg. the Random was 505 Paces.</p>
                        <p>At 10 Deg. the Random was 630 Paces.</p>

First find how many Paces the Cannon will shoot being laid level by the Metal, (which by him is accounted 1 deg.) Then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the distance found, by 50, then multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Quotient by 11, so shall the product be the greatest Digression, or Difference betwixt Rangs, and Rang; which being divided by 44, the Quotient giveth the Number of Paces, which the Bullet will lose in the other Rangs, from Degree, unto Degree; according to this Rule, this Table is calculated.</p>

                  <head>SECT. IV. Of Shooting in Mortar-Pieces.</head>
                  <p>A Mortar-Piece is a short Piece, with which they shoot Bombs, Granado-Shells, Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Balls, &amp;c. not by a Right line but from a Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, from on high; so that it may fall where it
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:40282:191"/>
should be desired: Now this <hi>Mortar</hi> is placed in the <hi>Carriage,</hi> in all respects as you see in Fig. 93. in which A signifies the Carriage, B the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,<note place="margin">Fig. 93.</note> C the <hi>Course the shoot flies,</hi> and D the <hi>Place</hi> on which it falls.</p>
                  <p>Bombs are great hollow Balls of Iron, or Brass, in which are put fine Sifted Gun-Powder, which by a Fuse, they proportion to them a due Fire, that so they may break assoon as they fall amongst the Enemies. These Fuses are small Trunks of Wood, Tinn, or Iron, filled with a prepared Composition for that purpose. Granadoes are of the same form with Bombs, only smaller, and many times are cast by hand, and are made of Iron, Brass, Glass, or Earth.</p>
                  <p>Now in Order to the well shooting in those kind of Machines called Mortars, 'tis requisite to observe these following Rules: as,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. That before you make a shoot at any Place, you find the distance thereof from your Mortar, which may be obtained by Prop. 3. §. 4. Chap. 9.</item>
                     <item>2. That the Bombs, or other Bodies that are to be shot, be of equal weight, otherwise the shoots will vary</item>
                     <item>3 That the Carriage in breadth be always on a Level, and without any descent, that so it may not leap in discharging.</item>
                     <item>4. That the Powder with which the Mortar is loaded, be always of the same force and weight.</item>
                     <item>5. That the Charge of the Mortar, as well in Powder as in Wadding, be always rammed in with blows equally heavy, and of equal number.</item>
                     <item>6 That the Wadds be always either of Wood, or Tampeons, or else of Okam, for the strongest drives it farthest.</item>
                     <pb n="323" facs="tcp:40282:191"/>
                     <item>7. That the Fuses be newly made, in those days that they are to be used, and that they be made of a Composition proportionable to the Range that the shoot shall make in the Air, so that the Bomb may break in the very moment of its fall; which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position must be such, that though it fall in the Water, yet not to extinguish, but the Bomb there to break. Now before we proceed any farther, I think it necessary, to shew how to compose your Ingredients for your Fuse.</item>
                  </list>
                  <div n="1" type="proposition">
                     <head>PROP. I. To make Fuses for Bombs, &amp;c.</head>
                     <p>The Composition for Bombs must be of a slow motion, that so time enough may be given to throw either Bombs, Granadoes, Fire-balls, Thundring-Barrels, &amp;c. They are compounded of these Ingredients, thus: Take a pound of Gun-Powder, 4/16 of Sulphur 4/16 of Salt-Peter, well beaten, dry, and sifted separately, then mix it, and make up your Fuse thereof: Or take Powder of Benjamin, and Small-Coles, all well beaten and mixed together with some Oyl of Piter, and so fill your Fuse therewith.</p>
                     <p>Now the use of Mortar-Pieces, being for the most part to shoot up at Random, therefore the Randoms of these Pieces is very necessary to be known: Therefore hereunto I have annexed the Tables of Randoms, calculated by the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the best of Authors, which have wrote on this Subject; most of which do agree in their Randoms, although they are in a several dress.</p>

                     <p>Diego-Uffano-Zutphen in his Works printed 1621, hath calculated these two following Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the one for the 12 points of the Quadrant, the other for every Degree, taking the one Half of each Number, and so 'tis reduced into our English Paces of 5 Feet, which Tables were esteemed and made use of, both by Captain Hexam, and Mr. Norton, and are as followeth.</p>

                        <p>Now suppose the Mortar to be placed at ☉, the Pricks in the middle line representeth the several Randoms, numbred with the Degrees of the Quadrant, forward and backward, unto which the several Randoms are set; so you see that the Mortar being levelled point blank, throweth the Bomb 100 Paces, if the Mortar be mounted one Point, it throws the Bomb 248 Paces, &amp;c. untill 'tis mounted to the 6th. point,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:40282:192"/>
583 Paces, which is the utmost Random: Now if the Mortar be mounted higher to 7, 8, 9, &amp;c. Points, the Randoms decrease again as before they did increase: as you see in the Table.</p>
                        <p>But in those latter Randoms there lieth a great mistake, as shall be made palpably appear. For if as they are distant from the sixth Point you make them equal to one another, then the Random of the 12 points, must be equal to the Random of 0 point, or the Level Random, which is 100 Paces from the Mortar. Now it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all Art and Reason, to think that if the Mortar be elevated to the 12th. point, i. e. bolt upright, it should shoot the Bomb 100 Paces from the Mortar; no, it cannot be; but according to all Reason the Bomb must fall down either on, or near the Mortar, and not 100 Paces dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, as is most erroneously conceived; the like errour is in the following Table of our said Author; but because Mr. Phillipps in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical Manual hath amply demonstrated their Errours, I therefore shall say no more to the Errours that have been a long time gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conceived and embraced as a truth, but now are removed.</p>
